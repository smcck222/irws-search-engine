ASSASSINATION IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The almost methodical manner in which the murder of El Salvador's attorney 
general, Roberto Garcia Alvarado, was carried out Wednesday is another sign 
that political assassinations have again become routine in that nation's civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy security that is routine for government officials and other 
members of the political and economic elite in that war-torn country, Garcia 
Alvarado was killed as he rode through the busy streets of San Salvador. He was 
a passenger in a Jeep Cherokee equipped with armored doors and bulletproof 
windows, bodyguards in the front seat and additional security men traveling 
behind him in an escort car. When the armed caravan stopped for a traffic 
light, witnesses said, a man who had been riding in another vehicle calmly 
walked up to the Jeep, placed a bomb on its roof and walked away. The explosion 
killed the attorney general almost instantly, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Alvarado was the highest-ranking civilian official killed in the 
Salvadoran conflict in nine years. His death marks the definitive end of a 
"gentlemen's agreement" between the government and the rival leftist guerrillas 
not to target politicians and the families of politicians and military leaders. 
The killing of the attorney general followed by just days a similar bombing at 
the home of El Salvador's newly elected vice president, who was not injured in 
the blast. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks mark an escalation in a civil war that has already been terribly 
bloody. Worse, an escalation by the rebels clearly invites a harsh response 
from the government -- a government soon to be in the hands of right-wing 
politicians who have shown no qualms about using brutally repressive measures 
to fight subversion, whether real or merely suspected, in the past. In fact, 
that repression already may have begun. Although they have not been as widely 
publicized as assassination attempts on government officials, several recent 
killings in El Salvador appear to be the work of right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
The last high-ranking civilian killed in El Salvador was also an attorney 
general, but he was a Christian Democrat, Mario Zamora, murdered by a death 
squad in 1980. The Zamora assassination pushed many political leftists in El 
Salvador who had previously eschewed violence into an alliance with the 
guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. That alliance gave 
the FMLN a political legitimacy it did not previously have, and that has helped 
the rebels prolong the Salvadoran conflict. 
</P>
<P>
This sad lesson in the unintended side effects of repression should not be 
forgotten by El Salvador's President-elect Alfredo Cristiani and his supporters 
in the U.S. government as they ponder how to respond to the latest upsurge in 
El Salvador's political violence.

PRAYER RESOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Senate and Assembly of California having approved Sen. David Roberti's 
resolution for three days of prayer for victims of violent crime, church 
leaders have been placed in a curious position (Metro, April 8). 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, they have no quarrel with widespread prayer. But are they not 
discomforted by its being designated by the governing body of the state? Have 
religious observances suddenly become the business of government legislators? 
What has happened to separation of church and state as guaranteed by the 
Constitution?

CAR INSURANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
I almost laughed myself silly when I read the letter (April 16) from the 
insurance industry official saying that the industry was doing all it could to 
obey the law and help the consumer. I have lived in California one year and 
just received my renewal notice. My wife and I have had no accidents, no 
tickets, no claims, and I received a 20% increase in my premium. With help like 
that, I will grow poorer while the insurance companies will grow richer. 
Proposition 103 be damned and the public too.

GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As your recent series of articles indicated, Los Angeles is slowly becoming a 
less satisfactory place to live. Your poll tallied many of the symptoms -- 
crime, traffic, the price of housing, rudeness -- but did not bring out the 
root causes. I suggest Los Angeles is suffering from a creeping, debilitating 
disease: growth in an already big city. 
</P>
<P>
Think back how it was when you first came here 5, 10 or 50 years ago. Was it 
not a saner, more humane, safer and more pleasant place to live? While many of 
these characteristics have been eroded in both towns and cities throughout the 
United States, they are infinitely worsened by city size and crowding. 
</P>
<P>
How shall we save this still-wonderful city? Let us become a mature city, 
stable in size without the fever and delirium created by growth. Let our 
building and housing regulations focus on rebuilding, presumably improving our 
physical structure, rather than having those very regulations enhance 
development. We should also use water and sewage as controls: no new water to 
Southern California and no new sewage hookups. We must come to realize that 
more people are the greatest threat to our environment.

BEIRUT'S BRUTAL ANARCHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arab League foreign ministers had planned to convene in emergency session today 
to talk about the murderous wave of violence in Lebanon, but the meeting was 
postponed when some of the officials discovered they had prior and presumably 
more pressing engagements. So much for any sense of urgency over the latest and 
possibly most destructive round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war. 
The ministers may try to meet next week, or maybe they won't. In the end, it 
may make little difference. If history is a guide, the fighting that has rocked 
Beirut for five weeks will subside only when those behind it -- Iraqi-aided 
Christian army and militia forces on one side and Syrian-backed Muslim and 
Druse militias on the other -- conclude that for now, nothing more is to be 
gained by continuing the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the carnage goes on and the demolition and displacement spread. As 
many as 300,000 people have fled the capital to escape the destruction brought 
by indiscriminate artillery exchanges. Beirut is now without water and 
electricity. Fuel is short, bakers can't make bread and garbage goes 
uncollected, adding the risks of epidemic disease to the ruin brought by war. 
Except for intervals between shellings, life is lived largely in the bomb 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as a national government in Lebanon to try to impose 
control. Instead, there are two claimants to power, one Christian, one Muslim, 
neither with any recognized political legitimacy. The latest fighting erupted 
when the Christian, Gen. Michel Aoun, imprudently tried to impose an air and 
sea blockade on the Mediterranean ports controlled by the Muslim and Druse 
militias. Retaliation was swift. Syria, whose 40,000 "peacekeeping" troops 
control about 60% of Lebanese territory, added the power of its artillery to 
the guns of its Lebanese allies. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian forces in the meantime found an unexpected backer of their own in 
Iraq, Syria's longtime ideological enemy. Iraqi weapons have given Aoun the 
means to continue fighting, even as Iraq's involvement has given the battle on 
Lebanese soil the added dimension of a power struggle between two outsiders, 
compounding the difficulties of trying to restore an armistice. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes on, a brutal and remorseless conflict that long ago seemed to 
have moved beyond the reach of reason or international moral suasion. The fear 
that has long haunted the Lebanese is that their country's chronic and 
seemingly irreconcilable tribal antagonisms would one day produce formal 
political partition. The frightful events of the last five weeks can only have 
deepened that fear.

EXTENDING HEALTH COVERAGE

The column by Brown describes his bill that would mandate that every employer 
provide health insurance for all employees who work more than "half time." 
Incredible! As a small businessman, I request equal time. 
</P>
<P>
Do Brown or any other legislator supping at the public trough have any concept 
of the amount of income small business owners have? Don't any of those 
"protectors of the commonweal" do any kind of research before proposing such 
enormous economic burdens upon the populace? Consider the following: 
</P>
<P>
California law currently requires that all businesses in the state provide 
workers' compensation insurance for all their employees. The law mandates that 
all businesses support state unemployment insurance. Laws are, in effect, 
requiring that businesses pay an "employee training tax." There are mandatory 
liability insurance laws; there are mandatory automobile insurance laws; there 
are reams and reams of records that must be kept for years under threat of 
prosecution should they be lost or incorrect. And now Brown has devised yet 
another plan that "will keep government out of the insurance business." 
Baloney! The very contemplation of the law puts government squarely in the 
insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot think of any governmentally mandated insurance program that is 
two-ended. Speaker Brown would require health insurance, but would not mandate 
lower insurance rates. "The market will determine the rates." Sure it will. The 
reasons given for not regulating rates are mostly that government should not 
become involved in the prices a business could charge for its 
services/products. But Brown does not hesitate to force higher expenditures on 
small businesses. Health insurance would cost about $150 to $250 per employee 
per month, depending upon age. That translates to about $12,000 per year for a 
5-employee business like mine. Where does Brown suggest that money come from? 
Higher product prices? Still smaller profits (so that the proprietors earn less 
than the employees?) Most small businesses (5 to 7 employees) are not making 
anywhere near an income commensurate with the risks involved and the demands of 
the marketplace. Add the cost of health insurance to workers' comp, SDI, and 
all the others, and you have to wonder if it's worth staying in business at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for the California Legislature and Willie Brown to bite the bitter 
pill of economic reality and recognize that if they want to make it mandatory 
for us to buy a service or product, then they also must make that 
service/product affordable. If they cannot guarantee that equality, then they 
must leave us alone.

The poor are not the only group with health insurance problems. Those people 
with pre-existing conditions cannot obtain health insurance today in 
California. Even if one is in very good health and willing to pay, health 
insurance is not available. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature should require that the health insurance industry accept 
everyone who applies and is willing to pay. Those with pre-existing conditions 
could be in an "assigned-risk" category and pay higher premiums.

POLAND INSTITUTIONALIZES COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL H. BERNHARD, Michael H. Bernhard is an assistant professor of 
political science at Pennsylvania State University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recently concluded round-table negotiations between the Polish authorities, 
the Roman Catholic Church and the Solidarity trade union are nothing short of a 
historic breakthrough in the Soviet bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which has brought about the legalization of Solidarity, comes at 
a crucial time for Poland. The economy has been stagnant for a decade and the 
people unmotivated to work. Political life also has been deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the Poles could not have successfully negotiated this settlement were 
it not for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's enlightened leadership in the Soviet Union. 
Significantly, the Soviet press did not register any judgment, positive or 
negative, about the conclusion of the Polish talks. This was important 
confirmation of the new Soviet leadership's willingness to allow Eastern 
Europeans more leeway in shaping their own domestic affairs. The limits once 
posed by the Brezhnev Doctrine are now unclear. Gorbachev seems to have come to 
the conclusion that a stable Eastern Europe, and a stable Poland in particular, 
is essential to the Soviet Union's long-term security. 
</P>
<P>
With its chronic crises, Poland has been a source of unending worry for Moscow. 
The last Polish crisis, the Solidarity period (1980-81), not only threatened 
the Soviet Union in a geostrategic sense (after all, Poland lies between the 
Soviet Union and its crucial ally, East Germany), but also gave the Soviets 
pause about the viability of their own system. If economic crisis in Poland 
could serve as the catalyst for a free trade-union movement, was the same not 
possible in the Soviet Union? And what did this mean in terms of the 
competitiveness of the Soviet system vis-a-vis the United States, a Western 
Europe soon to have a single integrated market in 1992 or a Japan, which by 
some measures already has a larger economy than the Soviet Union? 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, Gorbachev's granting of greater domestic sovereignty to Eastern 
Europe has not brought far-reaching changes to the region as a whole. Leaders 
of the Brezhnev mold, such as East Germany's Erich Honecker, Bulgaria's Todor 
Zhivkov and Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu, have used their greater autonomy to 
resist the sort of reform to which the Polish and Soviet leaderships have 
committed themselves. In Czechoslovakia, the man responsible for ending the 
Prague Spring, Gustav Husak, has retired. His replacement, Milos Jakes, casts a 
more benign image, but seems lacking in reformist imagination. The only other 
country in the bloc in which the reformist urge is clearly ascendent is 
Hungary. A Budapest daily, the Hungarian Nation, described the Polish 
settlement as an "agreement of historic dimensions." The Hungarian party has 
granted permission for the formation of a broad range of independent groups, 
including trade unions, and, most notably, political parties. In this respect, 
Hungarian reform could prove more radical than Polish. The round-table 
agreement did not authorize the formation of new political parties. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, however, the Polish settlement represents the most important 
political compromise reached in Eastern Europe since 1945. The final result was 
beyond the imagination of the Solidarity team when they first sat down to talk. 
Undoubtedly they would have settled for merely the relegalization of 
Solidarity. Remarkably they walked away with an agreement that included a 
transformation of the Polish political system. 
</P>
<P>
This agreement goes well beyond the Gdansk accord that created Solidarity in 
1980. That earlier agreement was a limited recognition of the right of 
independent groups to exist. In the new scheme of things Solidarity and other 
opposition groups will have the ability to actually sit in parliament and 
contest policy from within the state. The new Senate will have the power to 
veto legislation initiated by the lower house. Thus the settlement cedes a 
place within the citadels of power to the opposition, thus explicitly 
recognizing a role for it in ruling the country. 
</P>
<P>
It is through the Senate that Solidarity will have the greatest chance of 
exercising strong influence. Here it may well win a majority of the 100 seats 
in the upcoming June elections and thus possess an effective veto over party 
policy. While this may seem a risky step for the party, it is actually quite 
prudent. One crucial reason why the Gdansk accord ultimately failed was that no 
established rules of the game ever emerged to resolve disputes between 
Solidarity and the authorities. All disputes had to be resolved on the basis of 
ad hoc negotiations, often under highly polarized and extremely contentious 
circumstances. Allowing Solidarity to contest party policy by parliamentary 
means establishes an institutional mechanism to promote political compromise. 
</P>
<P>
This will not in itself quickly solve Poland's problems, but it does create 
political procedures by which Poles, both party and opposition, can begin to 
rebuild Poland's moribund economy and overcome its debilitating deadlock. We 
may well be witnessing the postwar rebirth of politics as politics in Poland.

ARREST AFTER WOMAN'S DEATH STUNS AVALON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents in quiet Avalon said they were stunned Thursday by the news that one 
of their neighbors had been arrested on suspicion of killing his former 
girlfriend, in the city's first alleged murder in at least 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Edward Kingman, 41, was flown from Avalon to Long Beach on Thursday 
afternoon and then driven to the Lakewood Sheriff's Station, where he was being 
held without bail for allegedly killing Gail Lynn Pissula, 34. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Kingman's friends and co-workers said she was a former girlfriend of 
his who had recently returned to Avalon in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Town Is Stunned' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is shook up about it," said Lolo Saldana, owner of the local barber 
shop. "The town is stunned." 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics received a call from Kingman about 4 a.m. Thursday and arrived at 
his trailer on Pebbly Road to find Pissula lying on the ground nearby, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman said Pissula came to his trailer and the two argued before she slipped 
and fell on a wooden patio, said Deputy Dan Cox. Kingman reportedly told 
deputies that he attempted to revive her but failed. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials declined to release other details or to say what led them 
to suspect Kingman of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman and Pissula had known each other at least since 1986, when both worked 
in Two Harbors, at the opposite end of the island, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Kingman has managed Pebbly Beach Building Supply Co., a 
lumberyard just outside the center of Avalon, said Jack Fennie Jr., the owner 
of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Fennie described Kingman as an excellent employee who reorganized the 
lumberyard and made it more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
He lived alternately in a trailer behind the business and in a sailboat 
anchored not far offshore, Fennie said. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman and the dead woman had lived together until they broke up last summer 
and she moved to the mainland, Fennie said. But Pissula had returned recently 
to look for a summer job in Avalon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare Crime 
</P>
<P>
Don Haney, editor of the Catalina Islander newspaper, said the alleged killing 
had shocked the community. "But I don't think there is a concern that the 
island has changed," he said. "Not many things like this happen." 
</P>
<P>
John Windle, who served as constable on the island for 22 years, said there has 
not been a killing that led to a murder conviction on Catalina in at least 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
One woman shot an intruder in her home in the early 1960s and was convicted of 
involuntary manslaughter, said Fern Whelan, clerk of the Catalina Justice 
Court.

ELDERLY HOUSING SWAYS OFFICIALS; CONDO PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a heated two-hour hearing, the Los Angeles Planning Commission Thursday 
reluctantly approved plans for a 168-unit apartment complex -- 100 condominiums 
and 68 apartments for low- and moderate-income senior citizens -- in the Barton 
Hill area of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Although all four commissioners agreed with opponents who do not like the 
location of the project, three of the four voted in favor, saying they felt 
compelled to do so because it will help ease a shortage of housing for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the commissioners had such mixed feelings that when Chairman William Luddy 
asked for a motion to approve the project, no one stepped forward. Finally, 
saying there was no other way to get on with the day's business, Luddy 
temporarily relinquished the chair to make the motion himself. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a close judgment call," Luddy said to the crowd of dozens who packed 
the hearing room at the Los Angeles Harbor Department. His motion was seconded 
by commissioner Theodore Stein, who said: "This is a very reluctant second." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed development, named Bridgeview, would be built along Beacon Street, 
from O'Farrell Street north to where Harbor Boulevard intersects with the ramp 
that leads to the Vincent Thomas Bridge. Developers also propose a 
7,000-square-foot senior citizens center for the site. 
</P>
<P>
Backers say Bridgeview will fill a desperate need by providing affordable 
housing for senior citizens at a time when the wait to move into such 
apartments can be as long as five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who lives in San Pedro knows of the lack of housing we have," said 
resident Grayce Beacom, who told commissioners that she lives in a development 
similar to the one proposed. "What the seniors need is a roof over their 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents say the project, which will be built in a heavily trafficked area 
on land originally zoned for manufacturing, will isolate senior citizens in a 
part of town that is too far from churches, parks and San Pedro's business 
district. And with proposed rents of $460 a month, they say the housing is not 
particularly affordable anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were saying, 'These poor seniors, they're living out in the 
streets.' " said Howard Uller, director of Toberman Settlement House, a social 
service agency in Barton Hill. "Well, this isn't going to help the seniors who 
live out in the streets. They can't afford to move here." 
</P>
<P>
Uller and others have charged that the developers, Michael and George Tumanjan 
of Torrance, are taking advantage of senior citizens to build "yuppie condos." 
Dee Petty, who heads the Barton Hill Neighborhood Coalition and works at 
Toberman, told commissioners: "You're trying to skirt these 100 condominiums in 
on the backs of senior citizens." 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview after the commission's vote, Douglas Ring, a lawyer for the 
developers, said linking market-price condominiums with below-market apartments 
is the only way private developers can build affordable housing. "You can't 
build subsidized housing without something to subsidize it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners attached several conditions to the approval. The developers, who 
had proposed offering a shuttle service for the senior citizens, will be 
required to operate at least two vans. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also required that the senior citizen units be maintained at 
below-market rates permanently, rather than for 30 years as the developers 
proposed. And commissioners turned down a request from the developers to 
eliminate guest parking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1st Proposal Was Larger 
</P>
<P>
Bridgeview was initially proposed as a 381-unit project, but the Planning 
Commission rejected that plan in September. In November the developers appealed 
to the City Council, which approved the scaled-down version of the project and 
sent it back to the Planning Commission for review. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision, however, is not the final step. The City Council must vote 
on the project, and it could overturn the conditions set by the Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In other matters related to development in the harbor area, the commission on 
Thursday delayed action on the proposed Wilmington-Harbor City Community Plan 
and approved an interim control ordinance that will curb residential 
development along Pacific Avenue in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The interim control ordinance is designed to encourage commercial uses on 
Pacific Avenue, once the community's main commercial thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
It requires developers to landscape their buildings and adhere to stricter 
setbacks.

SCHOOLS ORDERED TO LET HOUSING PROJECT PROCEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two Santa Clarita Valley school districts must issue building certificates that 
they withheld from a developer in a dispute over taxes earmarked for new 
schools, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Miriam A. Vogel on Wednesday ordered the William S. Hart Union High 
School District and the Saugus Union Elementary School District to give M.J. 
Brock &amp; Sons certificates of compliance so it can begin construction of a 
121-unit low-income housing project in the Haskell Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County cannot issue building permits for the project until it 
receives certificates of compliance from the school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel also instructed the firm to pay the district about $549,000 in taxes for 
school construction. Robert Garcin, general counsel for M.J. Brock, said the 
firm already has paid the disputed taxes but is undecided whether it will file 
suit to recover the money. 
</P>
<P>
The districts "forced me" to file the motion asking the court to order the 
schools to issue the certificates, Garcin said. "I can't understand why the 
district didn't give us the certificates when we paid the money," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Smyth, Hart superintendent, said the districts withheld the certificates 
because the developer paid the money -- $301,485 for Hart and $247,648 -- under 
protest March 29 "pending a judicial determination of the rights of both 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
"That certainly sounds like they're going to sue to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees of both districts voted earlier this month to withhold the 
certificates until Brock agreed to pay the money without the threat of a 
lawsuit. In separate checks, the company also paid the districts, without 
protest, a total of $256,561 representing $1.53 per square foot in school 
building fees, which are mandated by state law, Garcin said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they withheld the building certificates because by paying 
the money under protest, the company reneged on an agreement signed in 
September. In that contract, Brock pledged to pay voter-approved taxes on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes on developers in excess of the $1.53 per square foot were approved by 
voters in the Santa Clarita Valley's five school districts in June, 1987. But 
in response to a challenge by the California Building Industry Assn., the state 
Court of Appeal ruled the taxes unconstitutional in February. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the appellate court ruling, Smyth said, the developer should 
abide by the agreement and pay all the taxes without bringing suit to recover 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have entered into a contract in good faith, then you live with that 
contract," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Garcin said the agreement could be void because private contracts cannot be 
used to enforce unconstitutional laws. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth noted that even Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich sent a 
letter of concern to the company when it appeared the developer might be 
backing out of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said that the voter-approved taxes or developer agreements, 
such as the one signed with Brock in September, are the only way available to 
raise money to build 30 schools needed in the valley by 2010. The $1.53 per 
square foot fees will not generate nearly enough funds, Smyth said.

2 DEATHS IN 2 DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
PORT CONDITIONS UNSAFE, TRUCKERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
'What we are yelling and screaming about is broken-down equipment and 
overloaded conditions.' 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Bakke, Union official 
</P>
<P>
A caravan of truckers slowly snaked through Terminal Island on Thursday to 
honor a hauler crushed at the Matson terminal in an accident truckers say 
illustrates widespread unsafe conditions in their industry. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing here basically is having a memorial shutdown for Michael 
Gomez, who got killed here April 6," said Jerry Bakke, president of the 
1,100-member Waterfront/Rail Truckers Union. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are yelling and screaming about is broken-down equipment and 
overloaded conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration did not disrupt activities at the port. There has been a 
series of protests in the past year by truck drivers to dramatize working 
conditions, including long waits at terminals, but this was the first 
demonstration directed solely at safety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Under Way 
</P>
<P>
The Gomez death is being investigated by the Long Beach office of the federal 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. George Godzac, OSHA safety 
supervisor, said in an interview Thursday that the federal agency probably will 
cite Matson for a serious safety violation, which carries a possible $1,000 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
A serious safety violation is one that the employer should have known about and 
been able to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, 27, a truck driver from Montebello, was killed at the Matson Terminals 
facility while waiting in the cab of his truck for a cargo container to be 
loaded onto his rig, said Godzac and a Matson spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The container, weighing about 36 tons, broke free from a lifting beam and 
landed on the cab, killing Gomez, Godzac said. He added that the force of the 
fall broke the container in two. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan White, senior counsel for Matson, said the company "regrets the tragic 
accident," but will not comment until a company investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
White added that Matson terminals "has a very safe operation," but declined to 
discuss any previous fatalities. "We don't want to comment on past experience 
at Matson terminals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Matson and the union have been at legal loggerheads over picketing activities, 
and the truckers were placed under a Superior Court injunction in October not 
to interfere with company operations. 
</P>
<P>
Detective John Smith of the Port Police said that the all-day demonstration, 
which drew about 75 truckers, appeared peaceful and that union members did not 
try to prevent other truckers from entering and leaving the Matson facility. 
</P>
<P>
The Gomez death occurred just one day after another fatal port accident that 
also involved the loading of cargo containers. Killed was a ship's officer -- 
not a trucker -- but the accident was nevertheless cited by Bakke and other 
union officials as a further example of unsafe conditions at the port. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach on April 5, Choi Seong Shin, 32, second officer of the Hyundai 
Pioneer, was taking temperature readings from refrigerated containers just 
after they came onto his ship, according to J. D. Park, legal claims manager of 
Hyundai Merchant Marine. 
</P>
<P>
Park and Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Parsons said that Choi could not be seen by the 
gantry crane operator. A stevedore responsible for making sure no one was in 
the way of a swinging cargo container failed to notify the crane operator of 
Choi's presence, they said, and Choi was struck. The Coast Guard is handling 
the case because it was a shipboard accident. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons said the stevedore "did yell at this guy at the last minute when he did 
see (Choi), but it was too late." The Coast Guard may issue a safety citation 
when its investigation is complete, Parsons said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR DROPS ASSAULT CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent has decided against filing charges of assault 
and battery against a security guard with whom the mayor had a confrontation 
two weeks ago at a Hawthorne car dealership, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent had filed an assault and battery complaint last week with Hawthorne 
police alleging that the guard, Arthur Chamberland, hit him with a flashlight. 
The incident took place when Vincent and another man tried to enter Prince 
Pontiac on Imperial Highway after hours. The mayor said he was looking for 
money he had misplaced in a car. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberland's supervisors had praised his actions and said Chamberland was 
injured when his hand was pinned in a door. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed this week to drop the matter.

TARZANA CANYON TO JOIN STATE PARK SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
HOME BUILDER DONATES 440 ACRES TO CONSERVANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state parks agency has agreed to accept 440 acres of a scenic canyon in the 
hills above Tarzana from a developer preparing to build a tract of expensive 
homes along a southerly extension of Reseda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The gift of land in Caballero Canyon is one condition imposed by the city on 
the developer of the 178-home Mulholland Park subdivision. Another -- extending 
Reseda and paving a small stretch of Mulholland Drive -- is worrying some 
neighbors and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy voted earlier this week to accept the 
parkland gift, which will increase that agency's holdings near the Mulholland 
crest to more than 800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The state agency already owns a 382-acre tract to the west of the Caballero 
Canyon property, which is expected to be deeded to the conservancy this summer. 
With the addition, state holdings in the area -- including the 9,000-acre 
Topanga and Will Rogers state parks -- will form about a 10,000-acre swath of 
parkland from the San Fernando Valley to Malibu and Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
But a few critics have complained that the road work required for the 
development will degrade the newest tract to be acquired by the state. They 
also say it could be the beginning of a road for trash trucks to proposed 
landfill sites in Sullivan and Rustic canyons south of Mulholland. The sites 
are owned by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition Questioned 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dying to have those 440 acres," said Jill Swift, a Tarzana resident and 
Sierra Club member who leads hikes in the area. "It's just . . . what condition 
it will be in by the time we get it? 
</P>
<P>
"It's still beef, but instead of getting a filet, you're getting ground beef," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials and an aide to City Councilman Marvin Braude, who 
represents the area, said the road work will not be a foot in the door for 
landfill development. Braude opposes establishing dumps in the Santa Monica 
Mountains, and the conservancy is trying to buy Rustic and Sullivan canyons 
from the sanitation districts. 
</P>
<P>
But Joe Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, said he will ask city 
officials to allow narrower paved widths on Reseda and to vacate part of the 
city's right of way within state property. This would reduce the chance that a 
road wide enough to accommodate trash trucks could be built, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan Lee &amp; Associates, a Marina del Rey developer that is in the process 
of acquiring the Mulholland Park tract from Florida-based Avatar Properties, 
will consider scaling back the road work if area homeowners desire and city 
officials approve, said Michael Dieden, a partner with Harlan Lee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 1/2-Mile Extension 
</P>
<P>
Reseda now ends at Braemar Country Club. Under conditions imposed by the city 
when the 125-acre subdivision was approved years ago, the developer is to 
extend Reseda 1 1/2 miles to Mulholland to create a second exit for residents, 
in case of fire or other emergency. The Reseda extension is to be 44 feet wide 
through the Mulholland Park development and 30 feet wide across state park 
property the rest of the way to Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The developer is also required to spend about $250,000 on paving Mulholland to 
a width of 30 feet both east and west of the Reseda intersection. The road is 
unpaved for about 10 miles between Encino Hills Drive above Encino to Canoga 
Avenue in Woodland Hills. Gil Bechtel, a consulting engineer for Harlan Lee, 
said no more than a few hundred feet could be paved for that amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
The development was approved by the city in 1981, with the condition that the 
Caballero tract be given to the conservancy. But the project was delayed, in 
part because of opposition to the Corbin water tank that was finally built 
along Mulholland partly for fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
Contending that the development never received proper environmental review, 
Swift and other opponents urged the conservancy earlier this week to refuse the 
gift of land. But the agency's board voted Tuesday to accept it, saying that 
refusing the land would not cause the project to be reviewed all over again by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Authority 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said the conservancy had no authority to overturn a city land-use 
decision, only an opportunity to obtain public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Had the conservancy refused the land, the developer could have complied with 
city requirements by deeding it to the homeowner association, which would fence 
it off, Edmiston maintained. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, "there will be the opportunity to drive up to the end of Reseda . . . 
walk under sycamore trees and see a very pleasant canyon that, part of the year 
at least, has a running stream through it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That land will be publicly usable, as opposed to . . . private open space."

TENANTS ALONG BOULEVARD JOIN FORCES TO FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 50 Sepulveda Boulevard apartment dwellers on Thursday night formed the 
first tenant crime-watch group to fight prostitution and drug dealing along the 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou Holte, a Sepulveda Boulevard tenant who was mugged and beaten in 
October, organized the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of moving, I'm going to stay right here, and I'm going to watch what 
goes on around this place," she said. "People are going to get busted." 
</P>
<P>
And from the sentiments expressed by others at the meeting at her apartment 
complex in the 6600 block of Sepulveda, Holte isn't alone in wanting to get 
tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd clapped and cheered when Holte asked, "We have to do something about 
our neighborhood. Right?" 
</P>
<P>
Holte, who dubbed the new neighborhood watch group the Town Keepers, said 
members will inform police and apartment managers when they suspect tenants are 
dealing drugs or are involved in prostitution, a longtime problem in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Share Information 
</P>
<P>
Apartment managers agreed to share information to better screen out undesirable 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"We have every right to refuse to rent to a person who has been a nuisance at 
another building," said Charles Erdell Sr., who manages an 83-unit complex in 
the 6600 block of Sepulveda. "We are going to try to keep criminals out of our 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council recently passed a law that makes it easier for 
landlords to evict tenants suspected of dealing drugs, said Deputy City Atty. 
Marcia Gonzales, who supervises the city's narcotic abatement unit. The 
ordinance makes such activity a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said landlords are within their rights to refuse to rent to people 
based on their references from a past landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Several managers said that crime problems are driving tenants away. 
</P>
<P>
"Pimps were using vacant apartments for prostitution . . . It was scary to just 
walk past the people hanging out in front," said Toni Murrow, manager of the 
56-unit Sepulveda Terrace Apartments. "If we don't stand tough now, we are 
going to lose the buildings up and down this boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Police encouraged residents at the meeting to join Apartment Watch, a 
4-year-old program designed to teach apartment dwellers to look out for 
suspicious activity in their complexes.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROJECT GETS CONDITIONAL PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has certified the completion of an 
environmental impact report and imposed 83 conditions of approval for the 
proposed Marriott Corp. retirement complex on Crestridge Road above the 
Peninsula Center. 
</P>
<P>
On a 3-2 vote Tuesday, the council approved the conditional-use permit, grading 
application and zoning variance for the controversial project, which will 
include 250 independent living units and a 100-bed hospital. 
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions requires Marriott to reserve 12 of the independent living 
units for Rancho Palos Verdes residents, whose income cannot exceed 80% of the 
city's median income, an amount that has not yet been determined. Rent for the 
12 units cannot exceed 30% to 35% of the residents' income. The condition is 
designed to help the city meet affordable housing requirements set by state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Other conditions of approval include staggering employee shifts to limit 
rush-hour traffic and paying for an additional sheriff's patrol car to enforce 
truck speed limits and other safety regulations along the route to be followed 
by trucks hauling dirt from the construction site. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been opposed by neighbors, who said it is too large.

AGOURA HILLS ACCEPTS 6-ACRE OFFER IN LIBRARY CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura Hills has accepted a 6-acre land donation for a new library and 
community center, city officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of a 25,000-square-foot library is expected to begin in two years 
on the property, a hill near an office park on Canwood Street east of Kanan 
Road, Mayor Darlene McBane said. 
</P>
<P>
The land was donated by longtime Agoura-area landowner Patricia Kanan in 
exchange for the city's promise to name the facility the Kanan Family Library, 
McBane said. One room will be named for Patricia Kanan and one for her late 
sister, Judy, who was fatally shot in 1985. The case has never been solved. 
</P>
<P>
The city estimated last year that building a library would cost about $5 
million. But that estimate will have to be revised upward because the site is 
on a hill that will have to be graded partially, said Vince Mastrosimone, the 
city's public works director. It will be financed with municipal bonds, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 13,000- to 17,000-square-foot community center is also planned. But that 
facility would probably be built after the library, and no financing plan has 
been developed, Mastrosimone said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kanan land donation is the latest development in a sometimes controversial 
search for a library site. The City Council had planned to build a library in 
Chumash Park last year, but residents were opposed. When McBane suggested 
Forest Cove Park, residents protested and hanged McBane in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
Now McBane is among four of the city's council members facing a petition drive 
to hold a recall election. David Chagall, a leader in the recall effort, 
labeled the latest library site "a terribly irresponsible idea." Its location 
on a hill will require excessive grading and will result in a smaller building 
than could have been built on a flat piece of land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
McBane countered that the library will have a wondrous view of Ladyface 
Mountain and will be "the crown jewel of libraries in Los Angeles County."

Homefed Corp.: The parent of Home Federal Savings and Loan reported a 
first-quarter profit of $30.5 million, up 23% from the $24.7-million profit 
reported for the same quarter the previous year. Chairman Kim Fletcher said the 
increase was attributed to improvement in several of HomeFed's earnings 
components, including net interest income, which was $101.7 million for the 
quarter, up from $92.9 million a year ago. Loan-loss provisions, which are 
charges on earnings, were $10 million, up from $5 million the previous year. 
Non-performing loans as of March 31 totaled 2.27% of the S&amp;L's $17.4 
billion in assets. The percentage of bad loans to assets was down from 2.41% on 
Dec. 31. The S&amp;L made $14.8 million from its real estate operations, up 
from $8.8 million during the year-ago quarter.

NIGHTMARE OF ALZHEIMER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is fortunate Princess Yasmin Aga Khan Jeffries never had to institutionalize 
her mother, Rita Hayworth ("Alzheimer's: A Daughter's Nightmare" by Paul 
Hendrickson, the Washington Post, April 11). As a daughter of an Alzheimer's 
victim currently living out her last horrifying years in a sanitarium, I can 
tell anyone firsthand of the helplessness and despair I feel daily about this 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
But the truth of the matter is, a family has to be financially able to sustain 
this environment. Perhaps I am trying to relieve myself of the guilt I feel. 
But there is no way I can financially, at age 36 and single, quit my job and 
care for my mother full time, and be sure all of her needs are taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to institutionalization, my father retired from his job of 25 years to 
take on this task. This was an equally agonizing situation to watch and be a 
part of. No matter how much support our family could give him, he was the one 
changing his wife's diaper four times a day, patiently giving her showers two 
to three times a day, even though she kicked and tried to hit him, and 
eventually would break into tears because she didn't understand any of it. 
</P>
<P>
After four years of trying to do the impossible, and after family therapy group 
sessions for months, my father made the decision to put my mother in a "home." 
The family fully supported his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after her institutionalization, my father died of cancer. Even 
though there is no evidence to support my personal conclusions, I know the 
stress he was under for all those years contributed to the deterioration of his 
own body. 
</P>
<P>
To those in similar situations, please evaluate your decisions carefully. If 
you have the finances to provide the necessary care for these patients in your 
home, as Yasmin did, then you are truly fortunate. If not, 
institutionalization, although not the only alternative, is a viable one and 
most probably the only feasible one.

<P>
Who was that piling on the shirts and sweaters at the All American Boy shop in 
West Hollywood recently? None other than Italian film director Franco 
Zeffirelli, shopping with friends and chatting in his native tongue the whole 
time. But he wasn't all talk, and there didn't seem to be any indecision -- as 
in Shakespeare's "Hamlet," his future screen project starring Mel Gibson. We're 
told the director was dressed in khaki pants, an oversize shirt, carried an 
oversize leather bag and opted for more oversize goodies. His eclectic cotton 
mix included a few Henry Grethel cardigans and crew necks, some rib-textured 
sweat shirts and a Picasso-print T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Packing It In 
</P>
<P>
Joan Rivers didn't mean to call attention to herself at a baggage claim at LAX. 
But when she reached for a black linen suitcase with brown leather trim, she -- 
and Listen -- heard someone gasp, "Don't take that; it's mine." By then, Rivers 
had already collected six big bags exactly like the one she nearly took by 
mistake. The comedienne mentioned that the locks on hers pop open during long 
trips. Does she overstuff them, her new acquaintance asked. "Of course!" said 
Rivers. "What's the point of having them?" 
</P>
<P>
Covering a Novel Design 
</P>
<P>
When Listen heard that novelist Jackie Collins recently requested that all the 
paperback covers of her novels be redesigned to feature photos of Tallarico 
precious jewels (alone, not on models), we decided to find out what was behind 
the changes. The answer turns out to be simple. Collins just likes the way the 
stuff looks. She was photographed on the covers of Vanity Fair and Los Angeles 
magazines in Tallarico jewels. And, says Tallarico president Donald Tallarico, 
who designs most of the pieces in the collection, "I feel Jackie selected our 
jewelry because of our unique and original designs." 
</P>
<P>
Pour On the Gifts 
</P>
<P>
Old World traditionalism, it appears, is on the rise on the wedding-gift front. 
Two Hollywood couples received as wedding gifts crystal decanters from Pavillon 
Christofle. Newlyweds Mary Hart and Burt Sugarman received a Baccarat crystal 
decanter with four cordial glasses, while the one producer Steve Ross and his 
fiancee Linda Fogarty took home was made by St. Louis. So whatever happened to 
toasters? 
</P>
<P>
A New Racket 
</P>
<P>
Looking elsewhere for one-time "St. Elsewhere" regular Ed Begley Jr. (Dr. 
Victor Erlich on the show), Listen caught sight of him at Le Raquette Club, an 
underground, as in subterranean, gym in Manhattan. Begley was getting exercised 
over the Nautilus leg-lift machine. 
</P>
<P>
School of Finance 
</P>
<P>
Otis Parsons fashion-design students are breaking into the retail biz this 
spring, with their original styles for Nike sport shoes, Tadashi evening 
dresses and Betty and Sheila, a label for women's casual clothes. Student 
creations will actually be produced and included in the companies' commercial 
collections. It's part of a growing trend, says school spokeswoman Frances 
Balcomb, where manufacturers from around the world ask students to enter design 
competitions. If they win, they get a cash award, the school gets scholarship 
money and the company gets some bright student's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to Relax 
</P>
<P>
Paris-based designer Patrick Kelly arrived at the Ole Henriksen salon on Sunset 
Boulevard last week for a skin-care session and was promptly asked to remove 
his high-tops and T-shirt. Not that there was anything wrong with them, but the 
visiting fashion dignitary had said he wanted to relax and be pampered. He was 
given a foot massage and made to wear "little warm mittens on his feet," 
explains Henriksen. Next came a sound-wave skin treatment, which was so 
soothing it put him to sleep for about 10 minutes, followed by a relaxing 
facial application of warm honey and paraffin. When Kelly wasn't dozing, "he 
was the charming, fun-loving character you see in his ads," Henriksen assures 
us.

CLOTHESLINES: SAINT LAURENT PUTS A NEW SLANT ON SLITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYLOU LUTHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I read with interest your suggestion to slit the side seams of a 
too-tight jacket from waist to hips the way some Paris designer has done. Would 
the same premise work for a too-tight skirt? I seem to remember reading that 
skirts with deep slits were out now. Can you set the record straight? -- P.L.P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Skirts with deep slits were indeed passe until fashion king Yves Saint 
Laurent decided to slit the skirts in his last haute couture collection. Now, 
not only is this look catching on with other designers, it has occasioned a 
whole new trend in panty hose -- namely, shimmery, iridescent legs for day. 
</P>
<P>
Saint Laurent's slits aren't always in the seam, but close enough for the 
comfort you seek. These deep slits presume, of course, that you have legs worth 
baring and a setting in which they're appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
While the Paris designer's leggy looks were shown for day, they will probably 
be reserved for evening by most consumers as they might well be too distracting 
for most offices and too revealing for most luncheon napkins. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What shoes look best with the new folkloric clothes such as the choli 
blouses and ornate vests you've been writing about? -- T.U. 
</P>
<P>
A: Milan design guru Giorgio Armani shows his Nepal/India look with flat, 
sling-back sandals. Shoe queen Maud Frizon says her "turn toes" that curl back 
like Turkish slippers also are appropriate, adding that perhaps the most 
versatile shoe for all ethnic looks is that old favorite, the thong. Frizon's 
new thong-of-thongs is in black patent with raffia platforms. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please comment on the style of clothing best suited for the mature woman 
with osteoporosis. I have a feeling there are many of us with curving spines 
that make the tummies protrude. Which patterns would be best for petite women 
with such conditions? -- V.R.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: The shirring and/or gathers on dresses, jackets and tops with shoulder yokes 
are especially helpful in disguising dowager's hump and other figure problems 
caused by osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid dresses with waistlines, as the curvature of your spine will cause them 
to pull up, down or to one side. Smocks and smock-like jackets are especially 
becoming. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some patterns that will help compensate for your curving spine: 
McCall's 2718, 3770, 3511, 4100, 3921, 3963, 3487 and 4022. 
</P>
<P>
In ready-made clothes, the spring catalogue published by Vicki Wayne's Old 
Pueblo Traders, Palo Verde at 34th St., Box 27800, Tucson, Ariz. 85726-7800, 
offers several styles ideal for those with osteoporosis. Note the dress and 
jacket on the cover, the blouses on Page 4, the jacket dress on Page 8 and the 
pantsuit on Page 25. 
</P>
<P>
Q: All of a sudden my panty hose are bursting out in runs. Is it true that 
freezing panty hose before wearing helps preserve their longevity? -- L.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: That's one of Heloise's famous hints. I've never tried it, but it's one the 
research-and-development team for Hanes Hosiery (they also manufacture L'Eggs) 
puts in the category of old wives' tales. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Hosiery Manufacturers suggest some tips for prolonging 
the life of panty hose. "Be honest about size," the hosiery experts urge. "Too 
small hose can mean runs from tugging." 
</P>
<P>
If you've gained weight recently, perhaps your panty hose runs are emanating 
from tugging as well as the additional pull and pressure of added girth. 
</P>
<P>
Here are other tips from the association: Buy hose with a little spandex for 
stretch; pull hose on gently; watch for rings, hangnails and rough fingernail 
edges that cause snags. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Lately, I find many garments with fiber content labeled ramie. Could you 
tell me more about this fiber? I note that the care instructions always suggest 
ironing at a high temperature. Does this mean that the fiber is in the linen 
family? As you probably know, that fiber also requires high ironing 
temperatures. -- G.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: Ramie, also known as China grass, grows in tropical and subtropical climates 
and yields a fiber similar to flax, so your hunch about linen is essentially 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
This strong, lustrous fiber was used traditionally to make fishing nets and 
fire hoses. Like cotton and linen, it is absorbent and comfortable to wear. 
</P>
<P>
The people at the International Fabricare Institute recommend caring for ramie 
as you care for linen and cotton -- either wash or dry clean, according to 
care-label instructions. They say ramie is somewhat difficult to iron. 
</P>
<P>
For best results, they suggest ironing while still damp or misting thoroughly 
with a water spray and ironing with a steam iron. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm nearly 70 and living on a very small stipend. I wrote a novel, hoping to 
salvage my situation, and it has been accepted by a New York agent for 
representation. If the novel sells, I will be invited by the publisher to an 
expense-paid trip to New York, a night in a fine hotel and dinner with an 
editor to discuss a contract. Here's where you come in. What do I wear? I can 
come up with the price of an outfit, but it must be reasonable. I am 5-feet-4, 
140 pounds (well-distributed, considering) and young looking for my age -- 
despite my white, pageboy-style hair. I have an imperishable theatrical bent. 
Any ideas? -- V.T. 
</P>
<P>
A: How about renting a tuxedo for the time you'll be in New York? Tuxedo 
dressing for women -- a look the French call le smoking -- is the height of 
fashion right now. You can rent a tux for $50 to $75 -- far less than the cost 
of a new outfit -- and satisfy your theatrical bent at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
For day, wear the tux jacket with a black skirt and plain, non-tuxedo blouse in 
the color of your choice. For night, put on the whole works. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kind of man's shirt is best for wear with a classic, three-button 
navy-blue suit? The striped shirts with white collars don't seem to look right 
with this cut. -- T.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: You may call the three-button suit a classic, but it's also the big new look 
in European menswear. Wear it with a clean, classic all-white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new white shirts have a subtle texture, as in a white-on-white 
satin stripe, a dobby or a herringbone weave, but just plain old cotton 
broadcloth also is enjoying a return to grace. 
</P>
<P>
The new passion for white also has affected striped shirts, with the latest 
versions featuring fine pinstripes rather than the bolder stripes that Ivan 
Boesky first made famous as an inside-trader look.

<P>
Failure to Zigzag by Jane Vandenburgh (North Point Press: $16.95; 329 pages) 
</P>
<P>
If you saw 14-year-old Charlotte and her mother, Katrinka, at the soda fountain 
in Montrose, you'd think they were winding up a mother-daughter shopping trip, 
but if you were within earshot, you'd soon realize that this was no ordinary 
excursion. Katrinka is loudly insisting she's being pursued by teams of 
psychiatrists from Camarillo; Charlotte is desperately trying to calm her down. 
</P>
<P>
After the first few sentences, it's plain that Katrinka is no delightfully 
madcap mom but a woman temporarily furloughed from the mental hospital; not 
madcap but truly mad. From that point on, pleasure in the mordant satire and 
witty dialogue is edged with guilt and pity for the child who so valiantly 
attempts to understand and cope. "Charlotte had stopped listening. Instead, she 
was thinking about the nature of paranoia, that it, like the color of one's 
eyes and the shape of one's eyebrows and upper lip, might be a gene-linked 
trait." In a just world, she should be worrying about the fizzies and geometry, 
but there's no justice here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Runs in the Family 
</P>
<P>
During the periods when Katrinka is incarcerated, Charlotte lives with her 
maternal grandparents, Winnie and Lionel Ainsworth of Glendale. A short 
acquaintance with them can persuade you that psychiatry may have been too hasty 
in discounting heredity as a factor in mental illness, because Winnie and 
Lionel seem almost as irrational as Katrinka, though in socially more 
acceptable ways. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte's father is dead, presumably drowned when the Indianapolis was sunk 
near the end of World War II by a Japanese torpedo. Moving under cover of 
darkness with its cargo of uranium, the ship failed to zigzag -- standard 
operating procedure during wartime. That phrase not only gives the book its 
title but its leitmotif; "failure to zigzag" becoming the metaphor for 
Katrinka's inability to accommodate to reality; for the elder Ainsworth's fixed 
and rigid ideas and for the young naval officer's inexplicable behavior. Only 
young Charlotte is able to zigzag in this particular sense, developing the 
necessary resilience as a tot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shock Treatment 
</P>
<P>
The structure of the book is also a zigzag; opening with an extended segment 
delineating Charlotte's life with her eccentric grandparents, then backtracking 
to 1955, when Katrinka is released from the hospital only to marry a 
well-meaning red-neck who optimistically installs his new bride and her child 
in his ramshackle Radiant Beach house. There, Katrinka attempts to play wifey, 
a role for which her recent experience with shock treatment has clearly not 
prepared her. Riotously funny, these scenes are poignantly tempered by 
Charlotte's anguish. 
</P>
<P>
Though we're relieved when the bizarre marriage ends, Katrinka's next remission 
in 1962 has mother and daughter taking off in an Airstream to follow a 
struggling circus. Temporarily able to resume her "career" as a ventriloquist, 
Katrinka leaves with her parents' blessings.

A Coming-of-Age 
</P>
<P>
By buying her the trailer, they hope to be finally free of their troublesome 
daughter and to shift their burden onto 16-year-old Charlotte's capable 
shoulders. In the course of this final section, we finally learn the truth 
about Joseph Black, Charlotte's father, a mystery that has haunted the novel 
from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Charlotte is also free, though her liberation is more costly than 
any in current fiction. As affecting as it is astonishing, "Failure to Zigzag" 
succeeds in renewing that weary genre, the coming-of-age first novel.

William Kaiser is not giving up on his efforts to get four Oscars off the 
auction block and back in the hands of the original recipient, art director 
Lyle Wheeler. At a news conference this morning in Hollywood, Kaiser, a 
hospital supervisor from Tuxedo, N.Y., will unveil a poster "directed to the 
Long Beach couple (known only as Tom and Sherry) who have Lyle Wheeler's 
Adademy Awards . . . Please have a heart and return (the) four remaining 
Oscars. . . . You and the auctioneer already made over $21,000 from your 
initial investment of $20 from Wheeler's box of Oscars in an unclaimed 
merchandize sale." Kaiser will then head for Long Beach where, over the next 
few days, he hopes to place about 1,000 of the posters in store windows. Last 
month, Kaiser paid $21,250 to save an Oscar that was headed for auction and 
returned it to Wheeler. ALEENE MacMINN

In full-page ads this week in the Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety, actor 
Carroll O'Connor not only thanked friends and fans for their support during his 
recent surgeries but also offered lifesaving advice. "When your good doctor 
tells you to take the latest kind of cardiograph, and the latest is miraculous 
in what it can reveal about your heart, don't postpone, don't evade, don't 
content yourself with the fact that you're feeling swell. The new cardiograph 
may prove you're right, and if it does, fine! Celebrate! And stop smoking!" As 
for his own heath following coronary bypass and gallbladder surgeries in March, 
he wrote, "The old pump is delivering, for the first time in many years, full 
volume at full strength. I look forward certainly to better health in general, 
and even, possibly -- though I hate making big promises -- to having a 
pleasanter personality." ALEENE MacMINN

KTLA reporter/anchor Minerva Perez was in the right place at the right time 
this week. In Puerto Rico to attend a Latino media conference, she sprang into 
action after an explosion occurred in a gun turret on the U.S. battleship Iowa, 
killing at least 47 sailors. The dead and injured were ferried to hospitals in 
Puerto Rico. Her reports on a press conference concerning the tragedy were to 
air Thursday night not only on KTLA's 10 p.m. news here but also worldwide on 
Cable News Network. Aleene MacMinn

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: DINING IN THE EYE OF THE STORM AT TULIPE

Open kitchens are all the rage these days. Trouble is, most of them are so 
separated from the dining room that you really don't see very much. Tulipe is 
different; this new restaurant on the site of the old Ma Maison, 8360 Melrose 
Ave., (213) 655-7400, puts you right into the center of the action. And there 
you can watch two accomplished chefs, Roland Gibert and Maurice Peguet, as they 
cook up a storm in their new restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
And they are doing some pretty exciting stuff: Ravioli made of duck ham and 
snails in a bright green parsley coulis. Smoked salmon on a bed of sauerkraut. 
Wild mushrooms served with fava beans. A wonderful pastry of blue cheese and 
pears. And these are just for starters. The entrees, such as grilled scallops 
on a bed of caramelized shallots, are equally interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The room itself is bright, loud and rather plain: all the romance is on the 
plate. But prices, for food of this quality, are also on the plain side: 
appetizers are $4.50-$9 and entrees $14-$19. Two careful people could eat a 
three-course dinner for $50 (food only). RUTH REICHL

Minoru Ohira's latest sculptures continue an interesting investigation of 
opposites. This time, familiar black slate and clean sticks poke and prod at 
the idea of containment. Some pieces, like a stacked box arrangement in 
"Magician's Box," explode the idea of inside/outside with whimsical directness. 
The jet-driven "Mariposa 89" hints at the idea of what can be sucked up and 
contained unseen. Airy shapes bristling with sticks and glass resolve, for a 
change, into solid form. A powerful, wasp-waisted vessel of fitted black slate 
that hangs like a dark, fractured hourglass turned to stone. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Castellon makes earth -- rubbed found objects turned into 
"post-Colombian" artifacts. Working on a base of old paper bags and stacks of 
museum exhibition cards, the artist -- who was raised in Costa Rica -- has 
assembled the dirt stained remains of a pseudo-civilization. Pieces are 
uniformly ocher, as if recently unearthed. Shapes are mysteriously intriguing, 
sometimes resembling tools, satchels, walking sticks or old folded maps. 
</P>
<P>
Each piece is enigmatically titled "do," which effectively denies viewers any 
information about the supposed civilization while encouraging them to make up 
their own cultural scenario to explain the artifact's purpose and meaning.

Big business seems to be into society's new religion. Religion itself has taken 
to mimicking entertainment. The situation gets a barbed drubbing in Michael 
Hickman's newest paintings. In these quick, thin works, power lunches have the 
reverent illumination of the Last Supper, and the Crucifixion is strangely 
updated theater complete with colored Malibu lighting and a dying Christ in a 
business suit. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman's chiaroscuro technique of strong, contrasting darks and lights is 
bluntly direct. Scenes have the gritty reality of newspaper reproduction mixed 
with a quirky what's-wrong-with-this-picture kind of disjunction. Whether it's 
the apparent torture victim with a trash can hood in "Performance" or the 
placid gospel reader surrounded by guards carrying semiautomatic weapons in 
"The Word," every drama goes strange. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman's figures are rudimentary and the often garish color gives them a 
heightened urgency. They need that emotional push to withstand the 
volume-killing glazes he uses to pull the compositions together. Yet the raw 
color alone can be too blatant, as in hellish scenes of body builders and punk 
rockers. Hickman seems more effectively controlled in the mysterious grayed 
images that tangle the symbolic vocabularies of the sacred and the profane.

Pulling yet another batch of lush, free-standing wood pieces from his 
apparently limitless sculptural cornucopia, Martin Puryear shines. The sad fact 
that Puryear was recently the first and only black American to represent the 
United States in a Biennale (Sao Paulo, '88) pales in the face of Puryear's 
ability to coalesce the best of craft and the best of the sophisticated 
eccentricity that marks sculpture in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
When we refer to Puryear's craft this is not the analytical Teutonic will to 
order that built cathedrals of glass but the craft of the native weaver or the 
19th-Century artist-philosopher William Morris who said that respect for nature 
and oneness with materials bound object and maker in intimate dialogue. In this 
spirit, Puryear seems to coax and cajole like a lover the most sensual yet 
gentle forms from a variety of woods, making sculpture that teeters somewhere 
between evocations of life forms, functional objects and art for art's sake. 
</P>
<P>
A large odd-shaped "tub," too deep and narrow to imply use, is crafted from 
layer upon layer of steam-moistened, glued, then stapled sheaths of raw, rich 
wood. From one end of the vessel shoots a queer vertical "handle" worked in a 
similar way to look like the flat, flexible tail of a beaver. Several fine 
works are first formed and smoothed in wood then painted in a black charred 
color and resanded so that strategic bits shine through, attracting light and 
highlighting every carefully considered yet innocuous looking detail. 
</P>
<P>
One black piece looks like a big abstracted figurine of a long-neck dinosaur 
seen through primitive eyes; another exquisitely simple piece looks like a 
hollow storage container for a harp; still another like a stalwart cocoon woven 
not of silk fibers but of wood slats patiently bent and sanded to the 
malleability of wet plaster. As a counterpoint to the cerebral energy of Jill 
Geigerich shown next door, this show is a must. (Margo Leavin Gallery, 817 N. 
Robertson Blvd., to May 20.) MARLENA DONOHUE

"Someone called it the Law Wash," admitted Thomas White, a 44-year-old attorney 
who recently opened an office inside the Valencia Car Wash. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage of the arrangement, White pointed out, is that "I have a low 
overhead" -- and he wasn't referring to the sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
His office is adjacent to the car wash operation, and is open to foot traffic 
only. 
</P>
<P>
But White said that he has taken on clients "who happened to notice my sign 
while their cars were being washed." 
</P>
<P>
And, he noted, "They can still watch the progress of their car from my office." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the novel setting came to him when he operated a limousine service 
and a friend remarked that "I spend so much time at the car wash, I ought to 
move into an office there." When he saw the space-for-lease sign at the place, 
it was too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
White, who has two other offices in the Santa Clarita Valley, said he has heard 
the inevitable puns, too: 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, people who've had a brush with the law come here. And my fellow lawyers 
ask if they can get some of the overflow." 
</P>
<P>
The case of the Canoga Park transsexual with the three-wheeled automobile 
scheme may be coming to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a word or two of explanation is in order. 
</P>
<P>
Geraldine Elizabeth Carmichael, known before her sex-change operation as Jerry 
Dean Carmichael, founded an Encino car company more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
She was later convicted in Los Angeles Superior Court of various fraud charges 
in connection with the promotion of a three-wheeled roadster called the Dale, 
which was never produced. She disappeared in 1980 after being sentenced to 2 to 
20 years in prison and fined $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
But after she was profiled on a recent episode of the television series, 
"Unsolved Mysteries," tipsters alerted authorities to her whereabouts, who 
arrested her in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"She had been selling flowers on the streets and had crews of children doing 
the same thing," said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Youngdahl. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-promoter of the Dale was arrested in a suburb of Austin -- Dale, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
You may recall that a Long Beach store unveiled the world's largest bed last 
week. Just the thing to snooze on after partaking of the world's largest 
tostada, which was assembled Thursday at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
The dish, featuring 162 pounds of beans, 600 heads of lettuce, 40 pounds of 
Mexican sausage and 40 pounds of grated cheese, was later donated to the Love 
Is Feeding Everyone food distribution organization. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, promoters had said that the tostada's contents would be blended in a 
cement mixer. A driver did show up in such a rig, but he seemed unaware of why 
he was summoned. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by a reporter if the mixer was clean, he laughed and said: "Yeah, 
for making cement." 
</P>
<P>
The tostada was put together by hand, not mixer. 
</P>
<P>
If it were a movie, students asked to redesign their campus might start with a 
recommendation to replace the science building with a pizza parlor. 
</P>
<P>
But not in real life at Dana Junior High in San Pedro. Advanced drafting 
students there are so serious about sprucing up their school that they've been 
chosen to participate in a program in which they will work with the Los Angeles 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Frank Sele said his students are starting out with low-cost, 
"realizable" recommendations, such as improving the landscaping and adding 
murals. Naturally, a joke or two have been heard. "Someone cracked that the 
first thing we should do is level the school," said Sele. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment it sounded like KMPC traffic reporter John McElhinney was 
reporting a sighting of quacking animals loose on the San Bernardino Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Then he added, "Those are air conditioning ducts."

<P>
San Diego police asked the public for help Thursday in finding a car involved 
in a hit-and-run accident that injured a woman and her son earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The car was described by police as a "puke-green" 1974 Ford Maverick with its 
hood held down by a chain and padlock. The car has no front grill and may have 
gray primer paint on one fender, said Sgt. Michael Healy. The California 
license plate number is 1PVW557. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the car struck two of four people who were illegally crossing the 
street in the 2500 block of Polk Avenue about 2:45 p.m. Sunday. Agnes Gooden of 
the 4300 block of Florida Street was hospitalized overnight at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Her son James, 12, was in good condition Thursday at Children's Hospital with a 
broken left arm and right leg, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they obtained a description of the car after talking to witnesses, 
including one person who chased the car unsuccessfully. They also tracked down 
a former owner of the car who told them it had recently been sold.

<P>
A 23-year-old Huntington Park man was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury 
on charges that he possessed 545 pounds of cocaine when stopped at the San 
Onofre checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Santiago Moran-Pallan was arrested April 6 after U. S. Border Patrol 
agents found 248 kilogram bricks of the drug in the trunk of the car he was 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, U. S. Atty. William Braniff said the street value of the 
cocaine is approximately $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
Moran-Pallan is accused of possessing the drug with the intent to distribute. 
</P>
<P>

CAPTAIN AND SHARON ROGERS RETURN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Will C. Rogers III and his wife, Sharon, have moved back into their home 
on a quiet cul-de-sac in University City after five weeks in protective custody 
following the March 10 bombing of the van Sharon Rogers was driving. 
</P>
<P>
Navy sources confirmed Thursday that, about a week ago, the couple left the 
bachelor officers' quarters at North Island Naval Air Station, where they had 
been staying since shortly after the bombing. They remain under the protection 
of the Naval Investigative Service, the sources said. A spokesman for NIS 
refused to say what protection was being provided. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators have speculated that the pipe bombs that exploded under 
Sharon Rogers' van may have been planted by terrorists in retaliation for an 
incident last summer in which her husband, captain of the guided-missile 
cruiser Vincennes, mistakenly ordered the downing of an Iranian civilian 
airliner in the Persian Gulf. All 290 people on board were killed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Possible Motives 
</P>
<P>
However, the investigators have not ruled out other motives for the Rogers 
bombing, such as a disgruntled sailor. No arrests have been made and no 
suspects have been named. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers was on her way to her job as a fourth-grade teacher at the 
exclusive La Jolla Country Day School when the bombs exploded. She escaped 
injury because she had stepped out of the van at an intersection in La Jolla 
seconds before the bombs exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts Thursday to reach the Rogerses were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
She has not returned to work and is at an impasse with La Jolla Country Day 
School administrators, who maintain she is a security threat and have barred 
her from the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Following a storm of public criticism, administrators backed down and offered 
her two separate contracts for next fall. One would allow her back on campus if 
a "substantial" assurance of safety could be provided by the FBI, the NIS and 
the San Diego Police Department. The other would permit her to return "at the 
discretion of the headmaster." 
</P>
<P>
She has termed both offers "completely inadequate" and has demanded immediate 
reinstatement as a fourth-grade teacher or five years' pay. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Rogers and the school have been negotiating to reach agreement on a 
contract.

COOLING TREND, POSSIBLE RAIN THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY RATHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cold fronts and a low-pressure system are expected to bring cooler 
temperatures and possible showers to San Diego this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A low-pressure system that was stalled in Alaska has broken loose and is moving 
down to the coast, bringing gradually declining temperatures, stronger winds 
and maybe some showers to San Diego, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
"This will not be a Chamber of Commerce weekend," weather forecaster Wilber 
Shigehara said. "It's not going to be the best weekend for picnics, either, 
because of the clouds and cooler conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a heat wave, so turning cool might be welcomed by some people," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooling Trend 
</P>
<P>
The first front, expected to arrive today, will cool things off. There may be 
some morning drizzle today, with a partly cloudy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The second front should hit Saturday, bringing some drizzle or heavy mist and 
even brisker temperatures. Sunday's front will trigger a 30% chance of showers. 
About one-quarter of an inch of rain is expected to fall through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said he expects winds to pick up to 10 to 20 m.p.h. in San Diego, 
possibly up to 25 m.p.h. by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain and desert areas will have winds from 15 to 30 m.p.h. this weekend, 
with up to 40 m.p.h. by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be blustery and breezy," Shigehara said. "If you're planning on 
boating this weekend, watch out for the rain and winds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temperature Ranges 
</P>
<P>
Beaches will hit the mid-60s today, with temperatures of 62 to 65 degrees 
Saturday and Sunday. The coastal strip will hit 68 to 73 degrees today, 
dropping several degrees Saturday and Sunday. Nighttime lows will be 58 to 63 
tonight, falling to 55 to 60 Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The inland region should remain reasonably warm, ranging from 73 to 80 degrees 
today, to 68 to 75 degrees Saturday and Sunday. Nighttime lows will be 52 to 58 
degrees tonight, and 48 to 55 Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain areas will be 75 to 80 degrees today, 65 to 70 Saturday, and 60 to 65 
Sunday. Night lows will be in the 40s tonight, falling to 35 to 45 degrees 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The desert region should hit nearly 100 degrees today. Weekend highs will be in 
the mid-90s Saturday, 85 to 90 degrees Sunday. Nighttime temperatures will be 
60 to 65 tonight, and 50 to 55 Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean is 54 degrees.

KENNEDY'S CIZEK GETS HIS WAY IN 8-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mitch Cizek truly believes that he has developed a knack for the knuckleball. 
Given his druthers, the senior right-hander at Kennedy High would like to throw 
it 30 times a game, especially on days when his curve won't and his fastball 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely my best pitch," Cizek said. "I'd like to throw it more often." 
</P>
<P>
His coach, Manny Alvarado, doesn't necessarily concur. It seems that every time 
Alvarado agrees to let Cizek try one, it fast becomes a case of knuck and duck. 
</P>
<P>
"He likes it, but I don't," said Alvarado, who calls the pitches from the 
dugout. "There are too many times when his knuckler doesn't knuck." 
</P>
<P>
And though his knuckleball sometimes had all the movement of a tectonic plate 
Thursday, Cizek found the strike zone often enough with his other offerings to 
lead Kennedy to an 8-2 win over Taft in a Northwest Valley Conference game at 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Cizek (6-2), who won his sixth consecutive game, pitched a five-hitter and 
allowed one earned run. He struck out five, walked seven and threw 119 pitches. 
He may have been just wild enough to keep the Taft batters off balance. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight baserunners Taft stranded -- Taft also hit into two double plays 
-- the three left high and dry in the sixth were the most crucial. With Kennedy 
holding a 5-1 lead, Taft's Glen Nahmias led off the sixth with a home run to 
left. With one out, Doug Kougher singled, and with two out, Cizek walked Rich 
Cosentino and Rich Shapiro to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
With the Kennedy bullpen in action, Alvarado made a trip to the mound but 
decided to let Cizek remain in the game. Cizek struck out Brett Reisner with a 
curve on a 1-and-2 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he knows better than to take me out," Cizek said, grinning. "He knows 
by now that I can finish what I start." 
</P>
<P>
On this point the two agree: Cizek has six complete games in nine starts and 
Alvarado concedes that Cizek is a better bet to clean up his messes that any 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
"Mitch is a very, very strong kid," Alvarado said. "I was looking more to see 
if he'd lost his composure than if he'd lost his stuff." 
</P>
<P>
In essence, Taft (10-9, 6-4 in league play) was finished after one inning. 
Kennedy used a walk and consecutive singles to left from Gino Tagliaferri, 
Travis Bourne, Pat DeBoer and Danny Gugler to build a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Cizek wriggled off the hook in the sixth, the Golden Cougars (14-5, 8-2) 
added three runs in the bottom of the inning, including a two-run home run by 
Tagliaferri -- his sixth of the season and 16th in his three-year career.

HART SECURES AT LEAST A SHARE OF FIRST LEAGUE TRACK CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There might have been better boys' track teams at Hart High in the past 44 
years, but this year's team will go down as the first to win at least a share 
of a varsity league title. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, which has failed to win a boys' varsity track title in any league since 
the school opened in 1945, defeated Burroughs, 69-58, in a Foothill League meet 
Thursday to guarantee this year's team a place in the history books. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (5-1, 4-0 in league meets) can clinch the title outright with a victory 
against Alhambra in the regular-season finale next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's victory overshadowed a fine triple by Burroughs' Steve Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbell won the 100 yards in a wind-aided 10.2 seconds, the 220 in 22.6 and the 
long jump at 20 feet. He also anchored Burroughs' 440 relay team to a 
come-from-behind victory in 45.4. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate John Yim added victories in the 120-yard high hurdles (wind-aided 
15.3) and the 330-yard intermediate hurdles (43.2), but superior depth helped 
Hart turn back the three-time defending league champions. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burroughs (4-2, 2-2) won eight of 15 events, Hart placed second in 10 
of the 13 events that awarded three points for second. First place in the 
relays (440 and mile) is worth five points; second gets none. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, which has won six consecutive league titles in cross-country, also made 
good use of its superior distance strength, sweeping the 880 and mile. Hart 
also finished one-two in the two mile to outscore Burroughs, 26-1, in those 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we'd score big in the distance races," first-year Hart Coach Dan 
Houghton said. "But we got some unexpected performances from other athletes 
that really turned it around for us." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Miller was an example of that. 
</P>
<P>
Miller placed second in the 100 (10.5) and 220 (23.4) to temper Burroughs' 
expected sprint dominance. He also finished second in the long jump at 19-4 as 
Hart clinched the victory in the next-to-last event of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Blackwell and Jerry Smith added victories in the triple jump (42-1 1/2) 
and the shotput (49-0 1/2) for Hart. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' meet, Tracy McCauley won three events to lead Burroughs (3-4, 
3-1) to a 68-50 win. 
</P>
<P>
McCauley used a strong finishing kick to win the 880 in 2:36.3, the mile in 
5:54.5 and the two mile in 12:54.7. 
</P>
<P>
Shelley Alesso won the high jump with a season best of 5-3 for Hart (2-5, 1-3).

CHONG, CSUN STRAIGHTEN POMONA OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Kernen says that it's just another step in the evolution of a complete 
baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
Chae-Ho Chong calls it bad judgment on the pitcher's part. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Cal Poly Pomona got the message Thursday: Chong can hit a 
curveball. Soundly. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge first baseman, who faced off-speed pitches in each 
at-bat, drove in seven runs on two singles, a double and a home run as the 
Matadors thumped Pomona, 15-3, in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game 
at Northridge. The 15 runs were the most CSUN has scored this season and the 
most Pomona has allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Kernen, coach of the Matadors, had anticipated Chong's flurry. 
</P>
<P>
"When he (Chong) gets hot, he's almost impossible to get out," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos had a strategy in mind, but Chong set them straight. 
</P>
<P>
"(Pomona) thought the only pitch I could hit was a fastball," he said. "But I 
think that was a bad scouting report." 
</P>
<P>
The word on Matador pitcher Robert Wheatcroft was more accurate, however. 
Wheatcroft, a right-hander, traditionally has control problems early but 
toughens as the game progresses. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona (17-24, 10-9 in conference play) came into the game batting .310 and 
struck for a run in the first inning but did not score again until the seventh. 
Wheatcroft (10-2) scattered eight hits and struck out three en route to his 
eighth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN (21-13-1, 10-9-1) had built a 6-1 lead, then extended that in the sixth. 
Randy Thompson singled up the middle to lead off the inning, Craig Clayton 
flied out and Mike Solar walked. Chong followed with a run-scoring double down 
the third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
After Rusty McLain grounded to third, freshman Denny Vigo hit a ball that 
eluded Pomona third baseman Jorge Araujo for a double and brought Solar home. 
Greg Shockey then hit a shot off the mound and into center field, scoring Chong 
and Vigo. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Weisfuss' run-scoring double completed the five-run barrage. 
</P>
<P>
The final out of the sixth halted the Matador flurry only temporarily, though. 
Chong gave Northridge a 14-2 lead in the seventh with a three-run home run over 
the wall in left. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona looked as if it was going to mount a rally in the seventh when Araujo 
and Dave Hajek singled with one out and Chris Butterfield walked to load the 
bases. After Chris Goldbach hit a long fly to left, allowing Araujo to tag and 
score, Wheatcroft struck out Dan Fouts to get CSUN out of the jam. He then 
sprinted off the field pumping his fist in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I've established my pitches again," Wheatcroft said. "I didn't get a lot of 
strikeouts but they're a good hitting team."

CONTROLLED EFFORT LEADS CANYONS BY OXNARD, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Frith-Smith of College of the Canyons has struggled to hang onto his spot 
in the pitching rotation this season. And when he's struggled, wildness often 
has been the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
But Frith-Smith had little trouble with his control Thursday, pitching 8 2/3 
innings in Canyons' 4-2 Western State Conference win over host Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The change couldn't have been more timely. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great time for him to get his control back," Canyons Coach Len Mohney 
said. "He was getting ahead (in the count) early today and he had better 
consistency on his breaking ball." 
</P>
<P>
But while the victory, Canyons' fourth in a row, may have provided Frith-Smith 
with a confidence boost, Mohney said his pitcher's performance could provide an 
even bigger boost down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for us to have a three-man rotation and we need Frith-Smith for 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Pedersen triggered the Cougar offense with a two-run home run over the 
right-center field fence in the fourth inning. Randy Cooper hit a bloop single 
to center and scored on Cooper's home run to give Canyons a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Frith-Smith (6-4) and freshman right-hander John Stuart of Oxnard were locked 
in a duel until Pedersen's homer. 
</P>
<P>
"Stuart can beat anybody in this league, but we just didn't score for him," 
Oxnard Coach George Peraza said. "Both guys pitched really well." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard threatened in the second inning when Tim Bohling doubled and advanced to 
third on a ground out, but Frith-Smith pitched out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The Condors cut the deficit to 2-1 in the fourth on Steve Cerio's single to 
right and Gil Valencia's run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (19-12, 12-4 in conference play) added a run in the sixth when Adam 
Grant doubled to right, advanced to third on Cooper's sacrifice bunt and scored 
on Ernie Perez's ground out to Stuart. The lead expanded to 4-1 in the ninth 
when Chris Joy singled to drive in pinch-runner Ross Linstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard (13-13, 8-8) threatened again in its final at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Marcarelli and Juan Cuellar each singled and moved up a base on a wild 
pitch. But when Marcarelli scored on Vince Ebarb's ground out, it proved to be 
Oxnard's last run.

CAPUTI LEADS 17-HIT BARRAGE FOR VALLEY, 18-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mike Caputi had four hits and six runs batted in and Greg Struhl hit a 
three-run home run as Valley College battered three Pierce pitchers for 17 hits 
in an 18-7 Western State Conference win Thursday at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Caputi had a triple and double among his hits. Struhl's homer, his first, came

GRANT ERRORS VAULT MONROE TO 6-1 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Monroe High took advantage of four Grant errors in the first three innings to 
score three unearned runs and build a lead that proved insurmountable in a 6-1 
win Thursday in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
The miscues started early for Grant (10-4, 7-3 in the East Valley League), 
which Wednesday had defeated Monroe, 5-2, with the help of Viking errors. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe's first batter, Ernie Echeveste, hit a routine grounder that rolled 
between first baseman Raul Montero's legs. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Rolando, who was two for four, then tripled to right field, scoring 
Echeveste. Rolando scored three pitches later on Tim Costic's ground out to 
give Monroe a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Grant scored in the second on a run-scoring single by Stan Spancer, the 
Lancers gave away two more runs on two third-inning errors to fall behind, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Those four errors killed us," Grant Coach Tom Lucero said. "We made those 
errors at very crucial times and just gave them runs. I just don't understand 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe pitcher Sean Henson (3-3) pitched well with the lead, scattering seven 
hits and walking only one. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired the whole game," said Henson, who struck out only two. "I knew 
Grant would hit me, but with the lead I told myself to just take it easy and 
keep the ball low and I'd be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe (9-5, 7-3 in the Mid-Valley League) added a run in the fifth. Josh 
Lawrence squeezed home John Langley, who had tripled. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings scored their final run in the sixth after three walks loaded the 
bases. Adam Clark hit a sacrifice fly to drive in David Van Gorder, who was 
pinch-running for Henson.

SAN DIEGUITO IS THE SOLE OWNER OF SECTION BOYS' VOLLEYBALL TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

ENCINITAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Creased gently in the folds of their high school scrapbooks, the newspapers 
rest somewhere between prom memorabilia and graduation announcements. 
</P>
<P>
The newsprint is history. But when the San Dieguito Class of 1988 gathers for a 
look back 19 years from now, the players who won the first San Diego Section 
boys' volleyball championship will be able to look to the clippings and 
reminisce. 
</P>
<P>
Although girls have been competing for championship banners in volleyball since 
1974, it wasn't until last year that the San Diego Section of the California 
Interscholastic Federation officially sanctioned playoffs and a title match for 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it was dormant before. According to one-time San Dieguito Coach Terry 
Calen, the Mustangs started a club team in 1984, three years after Poway, Mt. 
Carmel and Torrey Pines did so. In 1986, schools from the Palomar and Avocado 
leagues combined to form the North County League. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first year we competed and were recognized," Calen said. "But until 
we had another league (other than the North County), CIF wouldn't sanction 
playoffs and a championship for us." 
</P>
<P>
So they had their own unofficial championship. Poway won the first in 1986, San 
Dieguito took it in 1987. And, with other leagues now active in boys' 
volleyball, San Dieguito defeated Poway for the first official banner a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something you can tell your kids," said junior Erik Sullivan, one of 
three current team members who also played last year. 
</P>
<P>
Team member Wayde Gilliam knows he'll look back on the event as a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it just happened last year," he said, "but in 20 years, the papers 
will say 'Twenty years ago, it was the first banner in volleyball.' It'll be a 
neat feeling. It's neat now, but it'll be classic then." 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito and Poway had met on four previous occasions during 1988, and each 
match went the full five games. Poway won three and took the Palomar title. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind. As Calen bluntly put it: "We won the most important one." 
</P>
<P>
Senior captain Mike Knapick said every time he thinks about the title match, 
the energy begins to build just as it did then. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still remember exactly how I felt at the time," he said. "It's one of 
those things you look back on, and the adrenaline just starts to flow." 
</P>
<P>
Even the coach enjoyed the novelty of the one-time event. 
</P>
<P>
"To be the first champions of San Diego was fantastic," Calen said. "It was 
great. To be the first, no one else can say that." 
</P>
<P>
And no one can say that the Mustangs are resting on past laurels. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito is undefeated at the halfway mark of Palomar play (5-0) and has 
lost just once in nine matches, early to La Jolla. The Mustangs are 15-1 in 
league games, sweeping every match except against Mt. Carmel, which won once, 
15-13. 
</P>
<P>
All this despite heavy graduation losses. Senior power hitter Gilliam, middle 
blocker Sullivan and setter Knapick are the only returners to a team that lost 
eight players, including four of six starters. Not surprisingly, San Dieguito 
was overlooked as a preseason favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a surprise because even though we're the defending champs, we lost so 
many starters," Calen said. "No one expected us to do anything this year." 
</P>
<P>
Two of Calen's former starters -- section player of the year Stace Lougeay and 
Jeff Zevely -- are redshirting at UC Santa Barbara. Two others, Jeff Homer and 
Brock Halter, are playing at Palomar College. 
</P>
<P>
"When you lose that many, you're starting from scratch," Calen said. "We relied 
on those four guys to do everything." 
</P>
<P>
Now the Mustang attack is more balanced. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more versatile," Calen said. "More people can do more things. Erik is 
the leader, but we have other people we can count on to do things. We have a 
better defense and quicker players." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is Sullivan (28 kills a game) who is the cornerstone. He plays beach 
volleyball to help him stay at the top of his game. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the player of the year last year, and we probably have him again (in 
Sullivan)," Calen said. "He's awesome." 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito may be on an up cycle -- "We've reached a point where we've 
peaked," Knapick said -- but it is more than a fluke that the winning has been 
carried this far, this long. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this team because they're all team players," Calen said. "There's not a 
selfish kid out here. They're enthusiastic, they're hungry to win, they stay 
excited and they're intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang starting six has a 3.8 grade-point average and the capacity to find 
a middle ground between all riled up and all too calm. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be both," Knapick said. "You have to walk a fine line between 
intensity and being laid back. You have to get in the middle. We've been able 
to find that middle point where everyone's playing at their best." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Gilliam, Sullivan and Knapick as the starting six are middle hitter 
Matt Fleming, outside hitter Chris Mansolillo and utility hitter Dan Coveny. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito's primary weakness is in its ability, rather in its inability to 
keep its high level of play against weaker teams. 
</P>
<P>
"People as people have a tendency to take the easy way out," Knapick said. "We 
sometimes play down to the competition." 
</P>
<P>
And everyone knows that repeating will be difficult, even though Calen says 
several of the top teams are a bit down this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll take luck to repeat," Calen said. "We need some breaks, but we're 
playing well enough now to do it. Originally, our goal was to go to playoffs, 
but now that we've done so well, we've modified that to winning the league 
championship."

MT. CARMEL'S KLEMASKE SHUTS OUT VISTA, BUT LOSES NO-HITTER IN SEVENTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pitcher Byron Klemaske of No. 1 Mt. Carmel was all set to pitch a no-hitter 
Thursday afternoon. And if not for his coach's brilliant defensive strategy, he 
might have pulled it off during his team's 8-0 victory over No. 5 Vista. 
</P>
<P>
He had a good live fastball early, a hard-breaking knuckle-curve in the middle 
innings and a new-and-improved slider late. He even warded off some evil 
"voodoo dust" from teammate Doug Hill in the sixth to keep the no-hitter alive. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Vista's Rodney DeLeon led off the seventh with a sharp grounder 
right at Mt. Carmel third baseman Mark Van Aelstyn, who misplayed it for an 
error, Klemaske hit Vista pitcher John Land. 
</P>
<P>
Now for Mt. Carmel Coach Sam Blalock's maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
Eight runs up, Blalock brought his infield in. But Vista's Ryan Tamburrino 
slapped a line drive past diving first baseman Sean Robinson. A fielder's 
choice groundout and a 5-4-3 double play later, Klemaske had his one-hit 
shutout but no no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my fault he didn't get the no-hitter," said Blalock, whose team moved 
into sole possession of first place in the Palomar League. "If (the first 
baseman's) back, it's a double play. I apologize for that." 
</P>
<P>
Blalock's defense made what he called "three major league plays" behind 
Klemaske, who struck out seven, walked three and lowered his 1.30 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The "voodoo dust" spell was put on Klemaske in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I said it to (Hill) the last time he had a no-hitter going, so he just said it 
to me today to get back at me," said Klemaske, who increased his record to 8-1 
and his strikeout total to 53. 
</P>
<P>
While Klemaske took care of the pitching, Van Aelstyn took care of the hitting, 
going three for four with an RBI and two runs scored. John Tejcek added two 
hits an RBI and two runs scored, and Sam Cornblum was one for one with two 
walks and a hit-by-pitch for Mt. Carmel (16-2). 
</P>
<P>
Vista dropped to 13-4-1, 4-1. DAVE McKIBBEN

AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: TEMPORARY ARTWALK PROJECTS GIVE CITY A 
GLIMPSE OF WHAT PUBLIC ARTWORKS COULD DO FOR LANDSCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Lewinson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ArtWalk can mean much more than a mass of people trekking downtown Saturday and 
Sunday to see art galleries, artists' studios, performances and the few sites 
where permanent artworks have snuck through San Diego's nationally renowned 
armor-against-art. It's a chance, and a challenge, to consider what the visual 
arts really have to offer a city. 
</P>
<P>
Four temporary projects in the Gaslamp Quarter and nearby areas lend themselves 
very well to such consideration. Each bears implications for what things might 
be like if artists and what they do were more a part of daily life here. None 
are in an art gallery. All were produced through Installation Gallery, the 
organizers of ArtWalk. 
</P>
<P>
The most unusual of the four is Mario Lara's "Home," a sculpture perched on the 
roof of the Arts Complex, at 9th Avenue and G Street. Here, Lara has created 
another of those structures which are a hallmark of his art: a physical 
mid-point between architecture, with its functional orientation, and sculpture, 
which generally performs no other task than being itself. 
</P>
<P>
This newest creation incorporates text and, for the first time, a silhouette of 
a human figure. The overall structure re-creates a cage. Inside is a mock TV 
with a picture of the Statue of Liberty painted on it. The cage suggests a 
house -- at least a kind of house, like a large cardboard crate or the entryway 
of a building that can be a house if that's all you have to call "home." 
</P>
<P>
Lara's work doesn't shout from the rooftop, it's just there, like the homeless 
people are just there, downtown. It's not a pleasant reality to confront, but 
the more it's ignored the longer it persists, as is true of any problem. Art 
can't solve the problem of homelessness, but it can present issues in fresh 
terms that can help keep concern alive. Any community that has any concerns can 
be served by art in precisely this way. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns at once more personal, more universal and more delightful bounce forth 
from the series of window installations created by Leslie Nemour for the 4th 
Avenue facade of the Balboa Theatre, between E and F streets. A sweet and wild 
jumble of brightly colored images -- fruits, insects, sections of road, tools, 
animals and people -- inject a jolt of visual jazz into this otherwise bland 
urban environment.

Nemour's inspiration comes from her young son, as she attempts to capture what 
it must be like for him to experience the deluge of new and unexplained images 
he encounters every day. Such childlike innocence and excitement successfully 
infects Nemour's work which, in turn, infects its immediate environment with a 
very wonderful vitality. Who wouldn't welcome this kind of influence in their 
community? 
</P>
<P>
More along the lines of what a painting does for a wall in a home or office is 
Todd Stands' and Susan Yamagata's billboard, at the corner of 6th Avenue and G 
Street. The image, titled "Big Nature," combines a blockish office building and 
a succulent of some sort in a brooding, drawing-like image suffused with an 
atmosphere of dark smog. 
</P>
<P>
The artists presumably intend to put forth a warning here. But more 
significantly, the image stands as a kind of foil to the commercial intent of 
other billboards. Notwithstanding the popularity of advertising posters for 
home decor, who wants ads on their walls? So why not ask that at least a little 
art be mixed in with the commercial billboards that constitute one of the 
principal types of "decoration" downtown? 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to billboards, there's a middle ground here, too -- where art 
steps out beyond its formal concerns to engage the world around it, as does 
Lara's "Home." Billboards, with their juxtapositions of imagery and text, 
naturally attract artists with this orientation. David Avalos, Elizabeth Sisco, 
Louis Hock and Deborah Small are four artists with strong interests of this 
type. 
</P>
<P>
Together they created a billboard at 11th Avenue and G Street that poses a very 
tough question juxtaposed against a salient image. The image shows Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. in mid-oratory, with his hand in a fist. The question posed 
takes the form of a fill-in-the-blank: Welcome to America's Finest a) city, b) 
tourist plantation, c) convention center. 
</P>
<P>
If this makes you think about recent events and controversies, then the artists 
have succeeded in their intent to make people more aware of their environment, 
the social environment in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Each is part of art's continuous fabric, reflecting aspects of what life is and 
what goes on in life. To deny art a place, to squeeze it into a corner, or to 
dictate that disengaged, pretty art is OK but engaged political art isn't OK, 
is to deny a place for life itself, because the two parallel and reflect each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
If this notion of reverberation between life and art informs people's 
experience of ArtWalk, the chances increase that new and interesting outcomes 
will result downtown and throughout San Diego. It was with the hope of 
increasing these chances that ArtWalk was organized in the first place.

KABUL'S CHILDREN: MINES, FLARES, HUNGER TAKE TOLL

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As she cradled the badly burned body of her 9-year-old brother one day this 
week, Gul Sharin explained without a trace of emotion how it came to be that 
her family of six moved to this war-torn capital three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was shot in the heart," the 16-year-old girl recalled in flat tones. 
"Our village was caught between a government post and the soldiers of the 
moujahedeen" -- the Muslim rebels fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"A bullet came. I don't know from which side. My mother was dead." 
</P>
<P>
So the family fled Parwan province for the apparent safety of Kabul. But the 
war soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
This week, as her two younger brothers played near the family's mud house, a 
magnesium flare -- one of the thousands that pour out of Soviet aircraft 
bringing desperately needed military and civilian supplies to Kabul each day -- 
landed nearby and burned both boys so badly that their features were 
unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am sad," Gul Sharin said, surrounded by nearly a dozen other 
flare-burned children who had come from other parts of the city to the surgical 
ward of the Indira Gandhi Hospital this week. "But war hurts. And there is no 
place for escaping this war now. The war is everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere in this beleaguered, battered and destitute city are the 
</P>
<P>
signs and scars of the decade-long Afghan war that refuses to end, marks that 
have been etched deeper since the Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops 
from Afghanistan two months ago. Even the Soviet Embassy compound suffered a 
direct hit from a rebel rocket Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bread lines form every day outside every city bakery. Almost no one can afford 
meat anymore. Food has become so scarce that children in rags occasionally can 
be seen in downtown parks crawling on all fours, picking clover and eating it 
raw. 
</P>
<P>
The markets are full of one-legged war wounded hobbling about on crutches. Few 
young men can be seen. Most of them have been conscripted into the army to 
resist an intensifying rebel campaign against the government-held cities. As 
the rebels had warned before the Soviet troop withdrawal, they have not given 
up their 10-year so-called holy war against the government now headed by 
President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Have Lost a Relative 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is difficult to find a single Kabul resident who has not lost at least 
one relative to a conflict that has claimed more than 1 million lives. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another side to the war in this ancient city known for its 
resilience: The war has spawned a whole new society of scavengers, stoics and, 
most of all, survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"It is almost bizarre when you stand back and look at it," said one of the few 
diplomats remaining here. "Aside from Beirut, there are few cities in recent 
history that have been worse-hit by war. And yet Kabul refuses to roll over and 
die." 
</P>
<P>
The symbols of that survival instinct are as common as the images of war. 
</P>
<P>
In the same market where bread lines choke the sidewalk, Abdul Saddiq, 55, a 
peasant who can no longer farm, sells dead sparrows for 18 afghanis (about 40 
cents) each. One bird can feed a family, he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vendors Sell Array of Junk 
</P>
<P>
Scores of crumpled street vendors sell a dizzying array of junk -- battered 
funnels, bicycle bells, broken springs, scraps of iron, telephones and hot 
plates, discarded wires, fan belts, drill bits and ancient screwdrivers. 
</P>
<P>
Once-thriving clothing merchants have turned to scavengers for survival. 
</P>
<P>
Musgidi, whose weather-beaten face and creased hands are like a road map of 
Kabul's decade-old struggle, runs a scrap metal shop that thrives on the war. 
He pays 12 afghanis per kilogram to the old women and children who spend their 
days gathering the twisted nose cones of spent rebel rockets and artillery that 
occasionally rain down on Kabul, as well as the fragments of government flares 
and land mines that indiscriminately claim the innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"No, this is not a good business," he said, as ragged peasant women and 
children unloaded soiled sacks of scrap metal they had risked their lives to 
gather during rocket or flare barrages on the city. "It is very difficult for 
the children. But this is my shop and I have to sell something. I must 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
It is those same mines and flares, though, that also cast the war's dark side 
in stark human terms. The starkest images of all are to be found in the Indira 
Gandhi Hospital, in the wards for war-wounded children where Gul Sharin stared 
blankly this week at her two terribly wounded brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rebels fire a few rockets into Kabul each day, residents say their 
biggest fear at the moment are the flares that shower the city throughout the 
day as Soviet aircraft try to keep the Afghan military well supplied and its 
civilians fed. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesmen say the flares are a necessary evil, their only defense 
against the rebels' U.S.-supplied heat-seeking Stinger missiles, which could 
easily be used to shoot down the Soviet supply planes that now are Kabul's 
principal lifeline to the outside world. The flares are meant to draw off the 
missiles, but their heat is as deadly to those on the ground as it is vital to 
the pilots in the planes. 
</P>
<P>
As the aircraft take off or land, they spew out scores of the decoy flares, 
filling Kabul's daytime skies with symmetrical patches of smoke and light 
tracings. Often, though, the flares are still burning when they they land in 
residential neighborhoods. All too often, the burning magnesium scorches the 
skin of children playing outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"It is criminal," said one Kabul resident, who asked not to be identified by 
name. "Now, when people hear a plane, they hide themselves. but the children 
don't know better. They don't listen. They are always the ones who bear war the 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
Near the burn ward where Del Sharin and his brother were lying in tears, there 
was another painful symbol of the war's toll. It is the osteopathic ward for 
the victims of land mines, which were planted by the government to keep the 
rebels out of the capital. Despite government warnings, they occasionally have 
claimed Kabul's own. 
</P>
<P>
Zarif, 9, was out looking for firewood, a commodity so scarce in Kabul that 
many people use discarded shipping containers for their homes and shops. A 
government soldier warned Zarif to stay away from a field near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Zarif did not heed the warning. He stepped out into the field -- and onto a 
mine that shattered his left leg. A few weeks later, the boy said, his father 
was in the same area. He, too, stepped on a mine, and was killed. 
</P>
<P>
On the bed beside Zarif, 13-year-old Mohammed Ullah was crying loudly. Surgeons 
had just amputated his right leg, and his mother, Bobo Gul, cradled his head 
and rocked him. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed, she explained, also was injured by a mine. He, too, had been warned 
away from the area by soldiers. But he, too, refused to heed. The boy, she 
said, was looking for food -- weeds, roots or anything else that would keep the 
family alive for another day. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know who is right or wrong," she said. "We want only for peace to 
come here."

EPA CALLS FOR RADON TESTING IN U.S. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sounding a new alarm about indoor air pollution, the Environmental Protection 
Agency warned Thursday that unhealthy levels of radon have been detected in the 
nation's schools and urged officials nationwide to test schoolrooms for 
possible contamination by the cancer-causing gas. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary health alert, issued by EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, 
was based on preliminary results of an agency survey that found hazardous 
levels of radioactive radon in more than half of the 130 schools tested in 16 
states. 
</P>
<P>
California's top public health official, reacting angrily to the sweeping 
directive, contended that the recommendations could create "unfounded fear and 
anxiety" in the state, where previous studies have indicated that radon is not 
a major public health concern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Not Included 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the state Department of Health Services, noted in 
a letter to Riley that the EPA study did not include any California schools and 
that the state's own survey of 29 schools had not found any hazardous levels of 
the gas. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said Thursday that he sees no 
reason for alarm in California. Based on information provided to the state 
Department of Education by the EPA and the state Department of Health Services 
last fall, Honig said, school districts were advised that there was "little 
likelihood that radon was a problem" in most of the state's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
However, because of the latest EPA warning, Honig said he soon will be sending 
a letter to school districts "outlining the conditions under which schools may 
be exposed to elevated levels of radon" and providing guidelines for further 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District began testing schools for radon in 
January, chief safety officer Susie Wong said. The district placed 300 
detectors in classrooms in 80 schools. The detectors were collected Thursday 
and will be sent to a laboratory today for analysis. The results are expected 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
"We did our testing to find out what kinds of levels our kids are being exposed 
to," Wong said. "We hope it's not a problem, but we want to confirm that it 
isn't." 
</P>
<P>
The stern EPA warning reaffirmed a statement released by the agency last 
autumn, when it joined Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in issuing a health 
advisory exhorting homeowners across the nation to test their residences for 
radon. 
</P>
<P>
Far too few individuals have heeded that advice, Reilly declared. He said the 
survey of schools raises new concerns about the danger radon poses to children, 
who are believed to be particularly susceptible to the ill effects of the 
radioactive gas. 
</P>
<P>
In making the health advisory public, Reilly acknowledged that it was based on 
preliminary and incomplete research. But he emphasized that the data collected 
was so troublesome and the risks so severe that remedial efforts should not be 
delayed until a more comprehensive survey is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"The risks posed by radon gas are very real," Reilly told the National Press 
Club. "But with a little thoughtful effort, we can solve this problem with 
relative ease." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the EPA's findings say they could grossly exaggerate actual radon 
levels because they are based on 24-hour monitoring even though radon levels 
ebb and flow throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Experts call radon the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States 
and blame it for 15,000 deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
An odorless, colorless gas, radon is produced by the radioactive decay of 
uranium and seeps naturally from the soil. Although it usually escapes 
harmlessly into the environment, the gas can reach dangerously high 
concentrations when contained by man-made structures. 
</P>
<P>
The severity of the radon threat varies geographically according to the uranium 
content of the soil. For example, the EPA estimates that radon levels exceed 
healthful limits in 10% to 15% of American households. But a Times survey last 
year indicated that radon levels exceed healthful limits in only about 1.2% of 
Southern California homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the EPA survey, 54% of schools tested -- and at least one in each of the 16 
states -- was found to contain one or more rooms in which radon levels exceeded 
the EPA limit of four picocuries per liter. Exposure to that concentration of 
radon is believed to pose a cancer risk equal to that of smoking half a pack of 
cigarettes a day. 
</P>
<P>
The highest reading, in a Tennessee school, was 136 picocuries -- an exposure 
equivalent to that of a four-pack-a-day smoker. 
</P>
<P>
Such health hazards, Reilly said, are "significantly higher" than the risks 
that the agency usually addresses in regulating such substances as pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Children are believed to face an even higher risk of exposure to radon than do 
adults because of their small lung capacity and high breathing rates, according 
to an EPA report. And because of their youth, radiation-induced cancer can 
develop over many years. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA recommendation calls on schools to test all frequently used rooms on 
basement and ground-level floors, where radon most often accumulates. The 
agency recommended that the testing be conducted during cooler months, when 
doors and windows are more likely to be closed, allowing radon to accumulate 
more easily. 
</P>
<P>
No federal funding is to be provided for the recommended radon testing, which 
Reilly estimated would cost a "few hundred dollars" per school site. 
</P>
<P>
Only limited federal resources are available for schools seeking to eliminate 
radon contamination, a process that usually involves improving ventilation to 
allow the gas to dissipate more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement critical of the EPA recommendations, California health director 
Kizer declared that "testing every classroom in this state would be a marked 
waste of money." 
</P>
<P>
The state's survey, which took 373 samples from 29 schools in 19 counties, 
found radon concentrations to be below detectable limits in 59% of the samples 
collected. None of the schools exceeded the four picocurie limit. 
</P>
<P>
Although the EPA study did not include California schools, it did monitor six 
sites in Nevada. The highest radon measurements there were among the lowest in 
the nation, tied with Indiana and Kansas. The most hazardous radon levels were 
found in Tennessee, Washington, Montana and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Noel K. Wilson in Sacramento and Elaine Woo in Los Angeles 
contributed to this article. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RADON IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Health Services tested for radon levels in 29 
schools in 19 counties around the state. None of the samples exceeded 4 
picocuries per liter, the level above which the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency recommends taking action. Below are the mean levels expressed 
in picocuries per liter found in schools in five Southern California counties. 
These readings are for a 24-hour period and do not necessarily represent actual 
year-around exposures.

MURDER SUSPECT SALCIDO IS FLOWN BACK TO CALIFORNIA

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Accused wine country killer Ramon Salcido was returned to California Thursday 
night on a private jet, escorted by U.S. law enforcement officials who took him 
into custody in Mexico City more than 24 hours after his arrest by Mexican 
police near his grandmother's home. 
</P>
<P>
The jet landed about 9:15 p.m. at Brown Field in San Diego and was immediately 
surrounded by 20 law enforcement officials from the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, U.S. Customs, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and 
San Diego Police Department. The plane cleared customs, refueled and flew on to 
Santa Rosa where Salcido was taken to the Sonoma County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the jail, a crowd of about 150 people chanted "Kill him! Kill him!" A 
number were carrying crudely lettered placards, one of which said, "Salcido 
doesn't deserve to live." 
</P>
<P>
Salcido was handed over to U.S. authorities in the culmination of an impromptu, 
three-day cooperative effort between Mexican and U.S. law enforcement officials 
that was cleared at the highest levels in Mexico City and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cliff-hanger right up to the end," a U.S. source said. "What made 
this happen is the president of Mexico (Carlos Salinas de Gortari) wanted it to 
happen. . . . The man said cooperate, find a way." 
</P>
<P>
With the bureaucratic stops removed, Salcido, 28, was captured less than a week 
after the killing rampage in Sonoma County. Six members of Salcido's family and 
his winery supervisor were shot or knifed to death, and Salcido's 3-year-old 
daughter and a co-worker were attacked but survived. Police suspect Salcido 
made his way to Calexico shortly after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source familiar with the events that led to Salcido's arrest said 
officials now believe that he took the bus across the border into Mexico from 
Calexico, in Imperial County. He rode the bus south to within two miles of his 
hometown of Los Mochis, an agricultural and seafood-processing city near the 
Gulf of California in Sinaloa state, and got off the bus along a main road. He 
walked the last two miles into town, the U.S. source said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are not sure which day he arrived, the source said, but it may have 
been as early as last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk Monday, Salcido walked up to a country store in Bamoa, a village where 
his aunt and grandmother live about 55 miles south of Los Mochis. Teresa Leyva 
did not know who he was but said Thursday the unshaven man with matted hair and 
well-worn clothes looked menacing. 
</P>
<P>
He scared her, she recalled Thursday as she sold sweets and tortillas from her 
one-room shop. 
</P>
<P>
"He was acting nervous, like he was afraid someone would recognize him. . . . I 
thought he was going to rob the store. I was frightened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities picked up his trail when Sonoma County authorities received 
telephone calls from his sister and brother-in-law in Guasave, about 20 miles 
southwest of Bamoa, the U.S. source said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Sonoma County officials were not sure what to make of the phone 
calls. But their phone number was eventually passed to U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents in Mazatlan, the seaside resort south of Guasave, the 
U.S. source said. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents made contact with Salcido's sister and brother-in-law on Monday, 
three days after the killing rampage, and U.S. officials notified Mexican 
authorities that Salcido was back in Mexico, the source said. The Americans and 
Mexicans decided to work together. 
</P>
<P>
"They were interested; they reacted; they supported us 100%," the U.S. source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Atty. Gen. Javier Coello Trejo, head of the Mexican anti-narcotics 
division, ordered one of his chief commandants to join the operation. He 
arrived in Sinaloa Tuesday morning, the U.S. source said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents stayed in contact with Salcido's sister throughout the day Tuesday and 
learned that Salcido had visited family members, perhaps first in Los Mochis -- 
where his mother lives -- and later in Bamoa. 
</P>
<P>
The farming area around Bamoa was good territory for hiding out, with broad 
fields of corn and wheat, criss-crossed by dirt roads and canals cut from the 
Sinaloa River. Salcido kept out of sight and may have been hiding at the home 
of his grandmother, Jesus Armendariz. 
</P>
<P>
The impromptu task force used the sister to begin corralling Salcido. Despite 
her help, the arrest almost did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. source said Salcido had learned an American journalist was nearby and 
believed authorities were close on his tail. Patrick McDonnell of the Los 
Angeles Times was the first American journalist to interview Salcido's friends 
and relatives, including his mother, in Los Mochis Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"When your reporter showed up, Salcido thought you were on to him, that you'd 
identified that he was there. We were half a step behind (the reporter) and we 
were going to lose Salcido." 
</P>
<P>
Salcido's sister helped the authorities trace his movements, telling agents 
late Tuesday that he was either at his mother's house or his aunt's house. 
</P>
<P>
"She checked out both places, and when she got to the aunt's house (near his 
grandmother's home in Bamoa) she found out his uncle (Camilo Gutierrez Galvez) 
had just taken him to the train stop" about two miles away, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in Bamoa told a somewhat different story Thursday. They said that at 
about 1 a.m. Wednesday, a squad of Mexican soldiers and federal police arrived 
in four or five trucks and surrounded the house of the Moreno family, across 
the street from Salcido's grandmother's house. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said plainclothes officers awoke the Moreno family, identified 
themselves, entered the dwelling and began asking, "Where is Ramon?" 
</P>
<P>
Luis Enrique Moreno, 18, said an officer aimed a flashlight into his mouth to 
determine if he had any gold fillings. 
</P>
<P>
"They said Ramon had gold teeth," Moreno said Thursday.

<P>
Convinced they had raided the wrong home, the agents crossed to the home of 
Salcido's grandmother, witnesses said. The neighbors reported the police took 
Gutierrez, who some neighbors said is not Salcido's uncle, into custody there 
and began beating him with fists and a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks than raced off to the small train depot and found Salcido about 1:30 
a.m., half an hour before the next train south was due to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"Salcido was waiting for the train to Guadalajara. He was going to go get lost 
in the big city. If we had been there 30 minutes later, we would have missed 
him," the U.S. source said. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido was not armed and offered no resistance, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido and Gutierrez were driven to the federal prosecutor's office in 
Mazatlan, and the source said Salcido promptly admitted who he was and that he 
committed the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to fly the pair to Mexico City late Wednesday night fell through when a 
Mexicana Airlines flight was canceled. It was not until Thursday afternoon that 
Salcido was flown to Mexico City on a different Mexicana Airlines flight. It 
was unclear whether Gutierrez was aboard, although authorities said he would be 
released from custody. 
</P>
<P>
In police custody, Salcido confessed to the killings on Mexican television. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm guilty. I killed them in the United States, and I expect to be tried 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On board the flight from Mazatlan to Mexico City, Salcido chewed gum and seemed 
calm when he said, "No, not really," when a reporter for San Francisco 
television station KRON asked him during the flight if he had any remorse for 
the crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
When the flight landed in Mexico City, Salcido was hustled into a van and 
driven from the main terminal to a private plane hangar across the airfield. He 
then was walked to a waiting jet loaned to Sonoma County officials by "Peanuts" 
cartoonist Charles Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five minutes after landing in Mexico City, Salcido was on his way back to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The official Mexican government communique said Salcido "accepted that he was a 
U.S. citizen and asked to be sent to the United States to be tried for the 
homicides he committed." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. sources said the transfer of custody was accomplished through informal 
negotiations between U.S. and Mexican officials. Although Salcido was born in 
Mexico and was granted permanent residence in the United States, the Mexican 
authorities pushed the American officials to smooth the legal process and say 
he was a U.S. citizen, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma County officials had brought along positive identification of Salcido, 
death certificates for his suspected victims, a report on his immigration 
status and a copy of the charges to help smooth the way, U.S. sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a U.S. source said, the American position was that "he had the full 
rights of a U.S. citizen under the Constitution, was a U.S. resident married to 
an American, with American kids, that he had a Social Security card and a 
driver's license, that he worked there openly . . . If it walks like a duck and 
talks like a duck. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source said also that color photographs of the savagely mutilated 
victims helped the process along. 
</P>
<P>
"This gets to the fiber of the Mexican family. You don't kill your kids. . . ." 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The informal "deportation" was not universally supported in the Mexican 
government. Some Foreign Ministry sources believed it was improper to send 
Salcido back to stand trial in California, in part, because Mexico has no death 
penalty and California law allows for capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how the Mexican government can hand over a Mexican citizen to be 
killed, no matter how much of a criminal he is," one Foreign Ministry source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Tunney, district attorney in Sonoma County, where the killings occurred, 
has said he will seek the death penalty for Salcido. So far, Salcido faces four 
murder charges there in the deaths of his wife, Angela, 24; daughters, Sofia, 
4, and Teresa, 1, and his boss at Grand Cru Vineyards, Tracey Toovey, 35. He 
faces two other charges of attempted murder in attacks on his daughter Carmina, 
3, and another co-worker, Kenneth Butti, 33. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Sonoma County said Salcido will also be charged with the 
slayings of his mother-in-law, Marian Louise Richards, 42, and Angela's two 
sisters, Ruth, 12, and Maria, 8.

Salvadoran soldiers and police arrested more than 100 people in raids on a 
leftist union federation, a refugee organization and a women's association, 
group leaders said. Military authorities said 72 people were arrested and 20 of 
those were released. The raids followed the assassination of Atty. Gen. Roberto 
Garcia Alvarado, who was killed by a bomb placed atop his vehicle. Military 
spokesmen said the military had information linking the groups to leftist 
guerrillas, but a union official said the raids were part of "an escalation of 
repression by the armed forces and Arena," the rightist party whose candidate 
won last month's presidential election.

The United Nations will send another convoy of food to starving masses in 
southern Sudan, this time along a different route than the treacherous path 
traveled by an earlier convoy that was attacked by rebels, a spokesman said. 
Seven people died in the attack in rebel-held territory. The new 47-truck 
convoy is to carry 1,100 tons of maize from Uganda's capital, Kampala, on a 
two-day journey to the Sudanese city of Nimule just across the border. 
Operation Lifeline Sudan seeks to avert 100,000 famine deaths by stocking more 
than 110,000 tons of food in southern Sudan before heavy rains begin in 
mid-May. But the operation, in addition to the attack, has been plagued with 
delays caused by political difficulties, bad weather and equipment shortages.

A judge has ordered a Ridgecrest couple to stand trial on felony child 
endangerment charges stemming from the malnutrition death of their 2-month-old 
daughter. Kern County prosecutors charge that James Lee, 37, and Tonnette Rae 
Lee, 28, allowed conditions to exist that were likely to produce great bodily 
harm or death to their daughter, Janelle Lee. Sheriff's reports said the baby 
weighed 3 pounds, 14 ounces when she died Dec. 8, well below the 5 pounds, 6 
ounces she weighed at birth on Oct. 1. The couple, who have two older children, 
said they fed Janelle a milk formula and a brand-name baby food regularly. They 
said they discussed taking her to a doctor two weeks before she died. However, 
the couple had only one car, which Lee needed to get to work at China Lake 
Naval Weapons Station. West Kern Municipal Judge Phil McNutt scheduled 
arraignment May 3 in Superior Court.

GOP LEADER OUT TO WOO MINORITIES INTO PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is, to say the least, an audacious thought. Imagine, the Republican Party as 
the party of blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Too much to swallow? 
</P>
<P>
Well, how about Republicans as the party of a growing fraction of 
up-and-coming, entrepreneurial, baby-boomer minorities -- blacks, Latinos and 
Asians -- perhaps just enough to shut the door on Democratic hopes of occupying 
the White House again this century? 
</P>
<P>
"This for the long run and winning those elections we've got right now are my 
top priorities," said GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater, President Bush's top 
political operative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Dreams 
</P>
<P>
Currently traveling through California, Atwater is full of big dreams and big 
talk about this latest GOP drive for national voter realignment. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Democrats these days count on 90% majorities among black voters and 
in the vicinity of 65% majorities of Mexican-American voters just to remain 
competitive in national elections. Even then, they can lose. 
</P>
<P>
If Republicans could double the GOP vote from 10% or so to 20% among blacks and 
from 35% to 50% of Mexican-Americans, Atwater said, they would dramatically 
lengthen the odds of keeping the presidency for the remaining three elections 
of the 20th Century. Atwater noted that if Republicans had received such 
support from minorities in the last couple of congressional elections, the GOP 
probably would control the U.S. Senate today. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of it in terms of the millennium. We have a millennium coming up in 11 
years, and what I would like to be able to do is look back then and say we're a 
majority party in this country. And one of the reasons we are is that when I 
was chairman of the party and George Bush was in his first term, we were able 
to make substantial gains in the black community and the Hispanic community," 
Atwater said at a stop in Los Angeles Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
His five-day trip to California is his first since the November election, and 
more than half his time is devoted to trying to loosen the Democratic grip on 
minority voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Image 
</P>
<P>
As Atwater pitches it, the barrier between Republicans and a larger share of 
the minority vote is a matter of image, not substance. 
</P>
<P>
"People say you will have to remake our party to do this. Not true," he said. 
"We have the issues . . . crime and drugs, education, jobs and opportunity, 
family issues and traditional values. Those things work fine for us." 
</P>
<P>
But Atwater continued, "We do have a bad image problem . . . a lingering image 
problem of being an anti-civil rights, anti-civil liberties party. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that is all an image problem. Reality doesn't conform to 
that, particularly with George Bush in the White House. There isn't a single 
thing in his political career that is anti-civil rights or anti-civil 
liberties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, Republican outreach has been a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater was forced to resign last month from the Howard University Board of 
Trustees when 1,000 black students stormed the main administration building in 
an impassioned protest. Students complained that Bush's presidential campaign, 
which Atwater managed, was laced with racism. 
</P>
<P>
A month earlier, one-time Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke won election to 
the Louisiana Legislature as a Republican, despite opposition from Bush and 
Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
The young national party chairman acknowledged, however, that a still bigger 
challenge awaits the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to cross what I call the sincerity threshold. I am not cavalier 
about this. We cannot just walk across the political stage and say we now want 
all these votes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to show we're sincere and that we want to broaden our party. . . . 
It's going to take a year or two. We're trying to change a historical pattern." 
</P>
<P>
To show some incremental progress, Atwater traveled Wednesday to Olvera Street 
and witnessed the conversion of half a dozen Latino voters as they switched 
parties and became Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jaramillo, an East Los Angeles contractor, said he had been a faithful 
Democrat since 1965 and never missed an election. Then he found himself drawn 
to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have seen from Mr. Bush is that he has the heart for the economic 
growth and social growth our community needs," Jaramillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Ledesma, a young Montebello mother, had a different political upbringing 
but was driven to the GOP for the same reasons. She was a Democrat because her 
parents were. Then a friend tried to interest Ledesma in Bush and the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like they strive for success, and I like that," she said. "I want 
that for myself."

5 SEIZED IN RAIDS ON 'BOILER ROOMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a dozen California "boiler-room" investment operations, suspected of 
fleecing victims nationwide out of more than $50 million, have been raided in 
what authorities Thursday called the nation's biggest multi-state telemarketing 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Five fraud suspects were arrested in the sweep, which lasted nine days. 
Securities agents from seven states said they have gathered more than a ton of 
evidence so far in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The firms are suspected of swindling an estimated 10,000 victims in 50 states 
by soliciting investments in bogus precious metals and oil and gas schemes, 
said G.W. McDonald, chief of enforcement for the California Department of 
Corporations. Most of the boiler rooms raided were in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested in the sweeps face a variety of charges, including grand theft, 
securities fraud, commodities fraud, unlicensed activity and violations of the 
California telemarketing registration law, McDonald said. Six others were 
arrested on charges of drug possession or on outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were made at a Los Angeles press conference attended by more 
than a dozen law enforcement officials, including representatives from the Los 
Angeles and Orange County district attorney's offices and securities officials 
from several states. 
</P>
<P>
Salesmen for the companies used slick spiels and high-pressure telephone 
tactics to sweet-talk their way into their victims' bank accounts, McDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said one unlucky investor who cooperated with authorities: "You just get caught 
up in it. It snowballs. The kind of money (I lost) hurts very much. There's a 
lot of things I can't do any more." 
</P>
<P>
The victims -- mostly middle-income, retired workers with scant investment 
experience -- lost nest eggs ranging from $1,000 to as much as $600,000 each, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Fraud Task Force estimates that telemarketers dialing 
out of the Southland defraud investors nationwide out of $3 billion to $4 
billion annually, giving Los Angeles and Orange counties "the unchallenged 
reputation as the investment scam capital and 'Cote de Fraud' of the entire 
United States," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 other California boiler rooms are under scrutiny in the ongoing 
investigation, said Doug Mays, Kansas securities commissioner and chairman of 
enforcement for the North American Securities Administrators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The raids were coordinated under a recently expanded federal program called the 
Leviticus Project, named after the third book of the Bible, in which it is 
stated, "Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
The project offers information and grants -- in this case $175,000 -- to 
boiler-room bashers in 20 states. California joined the project last September 
and immediately began the seven-month investigation that led to the raids. 
</P>
<P>
Starting on April 11, securities agents -- as many as 30 at a time -- from 
California, Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Georgia and New Mexico served 
search and arrest warrants at 12 homes and businesses. They carted away 140 
boxes of boiler-room records and evidence that now must be analyzed to form the 
basis of criminal charges in the seven states. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the sites raided were involved in fraudulent oil and gas lease schemes, 
Department of Corporations officials said. For example, salesmen at Cambridge 
Energy Ltd. in Century City allegedly told investors that if they kept their 
money in the company's energy program for 12 years, their investments would 
yield a sevenfold return. 
</P>
<P>
Others were told that the opportunity posed little or no risk to the principal 
invested, which was guaranteed to increase 17% in the first year, according to 
Scott Stapf, spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators Assn. 
In reality, one woman who invested $25,000 reported that she received $44 in 
income payments, Stapf said. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the sites raided allegedly were involved in so-called 
"gold-in-the-ground" schemes, the current fraud of choice among precious metals 
swindlers. 
</P>
<P>
Frontier Energy of Santa Ana and Carson City, Nev., which was also raided 
during the sweep, allegedly sold $7.2 million in unmined gold interests to 400 
investors in 41 states and two foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Title to Dirt 
</P>
<P>
In gold-in-the-ground schemes, swindlers use official-looking mineral assay 
tests to persuade investors that ore they have laid claim to contains 
guaranteed levels of gold. For an initial investment of about $5,000, investors 
are told they hold title to, say, 100 tons of unprocessed dirt. 
</P>
<P>
The con men then tell the investors that the gold found in the dirt will be 
sold to them at as low as one-third of the world spot market price. In reality, 
there is usually no mine, no ore, no gold. 
</P>
<P>
The Leviticus Project officially began operating in 1980, with funding from the 
Department of Justice. But it was born in the Appalachian coal fields in 1977, 
when regulatory and law enforcement agents from New York and six coal-area 
states got together to battle criminal activity in the coal fields. 
</P>
<P>
Its jurisdiction was broadened in 1985 to include oil and gas fraud. Precious 
metals fraud, a Southern California specialty, was added last June. Three 
months later, the California Department of Corporations joined up, embarking on 
the seven-month investigation that led to the past week's arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Through Leviticus, investigating agencies are reimbursed for such costs as 
hiring expert witnesses and transporting victims and investigators from state 
to state to prosecute perpetrators of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've always needed (to fight telemarketing fraud) is more resources," 
said David Katz, assistant U.S. attorney and head of the Southern California 
Fraud Task Force. "Precious metals is the big game here. With Leviticus money 
available to us now, we're really going to kick some behind." 
</P>
<P>
Other sites raided were: Midwest Petroleum of Los Angeles; S&amp;S Petroleum, 
Lake Arrowhead; Vulcan Mining and Development, also known as Esmeralda Mining, 
Escondido; Vulcan's Georgetown, Calif., mine site; Westar International, 
Thousand Oaks; Capital International Trading, Santa Ana; Oxford Oil and Gas, 
Century City; W. Scott and Associates, Carlsbad, and W. Scott's Carlsbad home. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud suspects, all of whom were released on bail, were identified as: 
Steve Scott Moleski, 29, of Lake Arrowhead; Todd Thomas Roberts, 28, Woodland 
Hills; two officials with S&amp;S Petroleum; Vulcan Mining's marketing 
director, John Treat Zimmerman, about 35, Escondido; Richard Bensacon, 53, 
Corona, a supervisor for the Karrington Group, which was not raided, and 
Hiromichi Hiro Hirahara, 37, Laguna Hills, vice president of the defunct West 
Cumberland Oil &amp; Gas. 
</P>
<P>
William Graysen, attorney for Midwest Petroleum, said the firm is a legitimate 
business that sells working interests in four Oklahoma oil wells -- three that 
have struck oil and one that is paying dividends. 
</P>
<P>
"What they (authorities) will find out is that we have a legitimate business," 
Graysen said. "I don't know what these other people have been doing, but I know 
my client is honest. It usually happens when they make a sweep that they catch 
the good and the bad, the black, the white and the gray."

ECONOMY UNSETTLING GOP'S STRATEGY IN WYOMING RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHEYENNE, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wyoming is one of the most overwhelmingly Republican states in the union, yet 
local Republicans felt pressured to prevail upon Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole to make the long trip here Thursday to help Craig Thomas against Democrat 
John Vinich in a special congressional race. 
</P>
<P>
That move speaks volumes about the peril facing the GOP -- and the opportunity 
offered Democrats -- in this state and throughout this economically hard-hit 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even as Dole was flying here from Washington, the Commerce Department 
released figures showing that the Rocky Mountain region had slipped into last 
place in per capita income for the first time since the government started 
keeping such figures 60 years ago. The regional average was $14,282, 13% below 
the national average of $16,444. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy here is lousy," said Dr. Louis Stadnik, a retired ophthalmologist 
and longtime Republican who came to the airport to hear Dole. "If this guy 
(Thomas) goes down, the Democrats can win anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worried About Losing Face 
</P>
<P>
Right now both sides agree that the race is too close to call. But in 
Washington, Republican leaders are badly worried about losing face in this 
contest for Wyoming's only House seat, which will be decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Dick Cheney won that seat with 68% of the vote last November, but he 
vacated it to become defense secretary. A GOP defeat here, coming on the heels 
of setbacks in two other special elections in the last month in districts 
George Bush swept easily last November, could well damage Republican efforts to 
recruit candidates to challenge the Democratic control of Congress in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But there's more at stake than prestige. For both parties the Wyoming campaign 
is a crucible for testing their strategies in the struggle for the Mountain 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have dominated this region, stretching from Canada to Mexico, from 
the Sierra Nevadas to the edge of the Great Plains, in presidential and 
congressional elections for a decade. In Wyoming they have controlled both 
Senate seats and the House seat since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, political pros and scholars think the Democrats have a chance to 
turn the tide, largely as a result of what Dole called the "double whammy" that 
has afflicted the region: the simultaneous slump in the key industries of 
agriculture and mining. 
</P>
<P>
"This region is more up for grabs than at any time since the 1970s," said Prof. 
David Magleby of Brigham Young University, a specialist on party strength in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that Wyoming has been hit on the chin more than once," Dole told a 
rally here Thursday. "But things are getting better. More jobs are being 
created. And that's the name of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Vinich, who came within a whisker of defeating Republican Sen. Malcolm 
Wallop last November, has his own ideas about that. He attributes Wyoming's 
problems in large part to alleged Republican failure to deal with unfair 
foreign trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington is letting countries like Japan, Korea and West Germany get away 
with too much," one Vinich commercial charges. "Between cheap foreign labor and 
unfair trade barriers they're hurting America, and I'm tired of seeing Wyoming 
people and Wyoming's economy pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, like Vinich a state legislator, contends that Wyoming must look to the 
private sector, particularly small business, for more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
This week Thomas issued a 13-point plan for creating jobs, pledging among other 
things to support a proposed Wyoming-to-California natural gas pipeline and to 
fight environmental proposals that might hinder the marketability of Wyoming 
coal. "My first and last priority will be fighting for Wyoming people and 
jobs," he declared." 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates have had trouble getting their messages across. First, Thomas 
was forced to refute reports, based on an interview with Edward J. Rollins, 
co-chairman of the national House Republican Campaign Committee, that Rollins 
had taken personal charge of Thomas' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Vinich got himself into trouble by charging that a bill Thomas supported 
in the Legislature would allow early release of some convicts by shifting 
prisoners from state prisons to county jails. That assertion was disputed by 
former Gov. Ed Herschler, who happens to be a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Some voters have been turned off by the campaign. "There's been too much 
mudslinging all around," said Carol Christensen, a Glen Rock housewife as she 
browsed through a shopping mall near Casper, the state's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
John Loos, a retired oil worker from Casper, said he had intended to vote for 
Vinich in hopes of boosting the economy. "But I've read so many bad things 
about him that I don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the confusion about the candidates there's little doubt about the 
state's economic difficulties. Wyoming's labor force peaked in 1982 at 241,000 
when demand for energy was still relatively strong. By last February that 
figure had dropped to just under 208,000. 
</P>
<P>
Though the economic decline began during Ronald Reagan's first term, it did not 
appear to affect Reagan's appeal.

MODERNIZING OF NATO A-ARMS GETS TEPID OK;

ENDORSEMENT WITHOUT COMMITMENT TO DEPLOY

<P>
NATO defense ministers on Thursday offered a lukewarm endorsement of the 
politically unpopular drive to update the alliance's nuclear weapons in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
While saying that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization intends to reduce its 
overall stockpile of nuclear weapons, the defense chiefs reaffirmed in a formal 
communique the desire to maintain "diversified, survivable and operationally 
flexible nuclear forces across the entire spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said that NATO plans to increase the range of ground- and 
air-launched missiles to compensate for the loss of medium-range missiles 
banned under the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the 
United States and the Soviet Union signed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Explicit Promise 
</P>
<P>
The ministers, however, did not explicitly promise to deploy new nuclear-tipped 
missiles in West Germany because of intense domestic opposition to the weapons 
there. British and American officials had hoped for a stronger commitment to 
future deployment of the new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said at the conclusion of the two-day meeting 
that West German objections to the new missiles had been vigorously aired. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised that there are differences of opinion within the alliance," 
he told reporters in an interview aboard his Air Force jet while returning to 
Washington on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"In the face of Mr. Gorbachev's very successful public relations activities and 
efforts to convey the notion that the Soviet threat is reduced, it's not 
surprising there is a lot of ferment, political ferment on these issues in 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised to unilaterally reduce 
Soviet military forces in Europe and has spoken of adopting a new defensive 
military posture. His statements have won broad public support among European 
populations that have lived for decades along a heavily armed border between 
East and West. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said recently that the first reductions -- withdrawals of 10,000 men 
and 1,000 tanks from East Germany -- will begin May 11. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney has repeatedly expressed skepticism about Gorbachev's moves and said 
Thursday that he wishes Europeans were not so swayed by the Soviet leader's 
soothing words. But, he said, he intends to press his campaign to upgrade NATO 
forces while seeking negotiated reductions in arms talks with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
There will always be conflicts within the alliance, he said, "but you have to 
play the ball where you find it." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also said Thursday that he is "reasonably confident" that Congress will 
go along with his request for funds for the new weapons, despite NATO's vague 
endorsement. Some lawmakers have complained that the United States should not 
commit hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and build new short-range 
missiles if the West Germans reject them. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney has asked Congress for $150 million over the next two years to develop a 
replacement for the Lance missile now deployed in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
80-Mile Range 
</P>
<P>
The Lance, which has a range of about 80 miles, will be obsolete by the 
mid-1990s, U.S. defense officials say. The United States must decide by 1991 or 
1992 which missile system it will build to replace it, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his campaign to sell the American missile modernization plan, Cheney 
also made public a description of Soviet efforts to improve their own 
short-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Pentagon summary of an extensive intelligence briefing given 
to the NATO ministers, the Soviets possess a 16 to 1 advantage over NATO in 
short-range nuclear missile launchers. 
</P>
<P>
The report also says that the Soviets are replacing old Frog and Scud missiles 
and artillery shells with more accurate, longer-range weapons and are building 
a new nuclear air-to-surface rocket.

SOVIETS CANCEL PLANS FOR 2 NEW REACTORS AT CHERNOBYL

The Soviet Union has canceled plans to construct two more reactors at the 
stricken Chernobyl nuclear power station and has halted expansion of all 
similar plants for safety reasons, the Tass news agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced six days before the third anniversary of the 
accident at Chernobyl, 60 miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine, that killed 31 
people in the world's worst civilian nuclear disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to construct two additional reactors at the facility had been suspended 
since the explosion of the No. 4 reactor spread a cloud of radiation over 
Eastern Europe on April 26, 1986. The No. 4 reactor is now sealed in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Addition of No. 5 and No. 6 reactors to the three-reactor plant would have made 
it the biggest atomic energy station in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Council of Ministers has adopted an unequivocal decision to abandon the 
construction of the fifth and sixth power blocks of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station on which work had been suspended after the Chernobyl accident," Tass 
said. "In addition, no plans will be made to expand other power stations now in 
operation that use the RBMK (graphite) reactors. Unlike Western reactors, the 
graphite RBMKs can be refueled without being shut down for months at a time." 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the other stations are at Kursk, in central Russia, and near 
the western city of Smolensk. 
</P>
<P>
The graphite system is inexpensive and simple because the reactor is made of 
piles of graphite blocks with interconnecting water-cooling pipes. It is hard 
to maintain, however, because the hundreds of thousands of pipe connections 
could develop leaks. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has 45 nuclear reactors in operation at 16 locations, and 
another 34 plants are under construction at 15 locations, according to official 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to rebuild power blocks that were constructed in the 
1970s and are now operating, Tass said. The reconstruction will take place 
between 1989 and 1994, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"These and all the newly constructed power blocks will be equipped with 
additional safety systems, which ensure safe cooling in case of an emergency," 
Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The new systems will allow inspectors to contain any radioactive leaks from the 
reactor complex, Tass said. Soviet engineers will have designs by the mid-1990s 
for a new generation of power stations.

Africa's worst locust plague in 30 years is almost over, the U.N. Food and 
Agriculture Organization said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An FAO statement said the population of desert locusts that ravaged crops in 
North and Central Africa last year has been virtually wiped out by pesticide 
spraying and lack of rain. Millions of locusts also perished in an 
unprecedented flight over the Atlantic last October. 
</P>
<P>
Only Niger and Mali have been infested in the last 10 days and only small 
numbers of locusts persist in West and North Africa.

U.N. ASSEMBLY ASSAILS ISRAELI POLICIES IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES

The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday condemned Israel's policies and practices 
in the occupied territories and asked the Security Council to consider measures 
to protect Palestinian civilians there. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution was approved 129 to 2 with one abstention. The United States 
joined Israel in voting against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly stressed the "urgent need" to expedite the convening of an 
international peace conference on the Middle East and asked Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar to submit periodic reports on developments in the 
occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has opposed such an international conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly acted after a two-day debate on the subject initiated by Arab 
states amid a 17-month uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Before casting his first vote in the Assembly since he became the Bush 
Administration's chief delegate to the United Nations, Ambassador Thomas R. 
Pickering criticized the language of the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"It is counterproductive and only succeeds in driving the parties further apart 
at a time when efforts should be focused on bringing them together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In debate on the measure, Japan criticized Israeli policy in the occupied 
territories, saying it is time its "futility" is recognized in face of the 
Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Makoto Taniguchi said Tokyo is seriously concerned "over the massive 
use of force by Israeli authorities against Palestinian civilians." 
</P>
<P>
"The repressive measures which the Israeli government continues to take against 
the Palestinian people run counter to the peace momentum that is being 
developed in the Middle East, " Taniguchi declared. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time that Israel recognized the gravity of the situation and the 
futility of its policies." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegate said the Palestine Liberation Organization represents the 
Palestinians and that it is essential that Israel and the PLO recognize each 
other's position and that the PLO participate in a regional peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PLO leader Yasser Arafat held a 90-minute meeting in Geneva with 
Perez de Cuellar and said the PLO planned to apply for full membership in all 
specialized U.N. agencies, a move the United States and Israel oppose. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters that the PLO, which now has observer status in the world 
body, will begin its campaign for full membership with a bid to join the World 
Health Organization.

WALESA CALLS POPE SYMBOL OF SOLIDARITY 
</P>

<P>
Celebrating the rebirth of Poland's free labor movement, a visiting Lech Walesa 
made an emotional pilgrimage to the Vatican on Thursday to thank a white-robed 
countryman who he said was the living symbol of Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"I greet you with all my heart," exclaimed Pope John Paul II, wrapping Walesa 
in a brotherly embrace. 
</P>
<P>
The high-spirited Pope whisked Walesa into his private library for a half-hour 
chat. There followed a patriots' lunch prepared by Polish nuns who learned 
their cooking while John Paul was still Karol Wojtyla, bishop of Krakow, and 
Walesa was an obscure shipyard electrician in Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
"My batteries are recharged. I can lift any weight," Walesa said after his 
papal audience. 
</P>
<P>
Spying a television crew from Gdansk, where Solidarity was born, the Pope 
joked: "Gdansk. Ah, I remember Gdansk. The light comes from Gdansk." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's three-day Italian visit is intended to woo international political and 
economic support for Polish reforms, and organizational and financial help for 
Solidarity from well-heeled Italian unions that are his hosts. 
</P>
<P>
In their talk, Walesa thanked John Paul for his support for Solidarity, caught 
him up on details of events at home and noted that the once-again legal union 
is rooted in the church's social doctrine, according to papal spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul told Walesa that reforms give Poland the chance for "social, 
political and economic transformation," Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
When Walesa and the Pope last met in 1987 on a papal visit to Poland, 
Solidarity was illegal. On Monday, after months of delicate negotiations, in 
which the church served simultaneously as a referee and a cheerleader, a court 
registered Solidarity as a legal union. In the aftermath, Walesa left 
immediately for Rome to thank a pontiff whose public and private support for 
Solidarity never flagged in nearly eight years of official repression. "Save my 
country, save Solidarity," the Pope prayed repeatedly during the dark days of 
martial law in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a standing ovation of doctors and medical students at Rome's 
Gemelli Hospital Thursday, Walesa left no doubt of the Polish Pope's impact on 
events in his homeland. John Paul spent five hours in emergency surgery at the 
hospital in 1981 after being wounded by an assassin's bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"Here the life of Solidarity was saved, because here the life of a great Pole, 
the Holy Father, was saved," Walesa said. 
</P>
<P>
For Walesa's first visit to Italy since 1981, there was constancy in the warmth 
of his reception at the Vatican, but a dramatic change in his more temporal 
welcome. When the longtime harassed underdog stepped from the Warsaw flight 
Wednesday, the Polish ambassador to Italy was on hand to welcome him with a 
spray of red and white roses. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Vatican, the Italian government is treating Walesa almost as though he 
were a head of state. Walesa, who is accompanied by his wife, Danuta, five 
aides and the archbishop of Gdansk, meets today with President Francesco 
Cossiga and Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita in search of aid for a nation he 
said is enduring "an economic disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The union leader, who has an avid Italian following, will also confer today 
with Italy's three top industrialists. Italian newspapers speculate that 
economic initiatives for Poland from both the Italian state and the 
export-hungry private sector may be in hand in time for a scheduled state visit 
to Poland by Cossiga next month. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Pope, who also met Thursday with Irish President Patrick J. 
Hillery and renewed his call for a cease-fire in fighting between Christian 
factions and Muslim and Syrian forces in Lebanon, begins intensive preparations 
today for the first of four scheduled trips abroad this year. He leaves next 
Friday for nine days in Africa, with stops in Madagascar, Malawi and Zambia, as 
well as the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion.

SOVIET SHIP BEGINS SKIMMING OIL AS LUJAN ARRIVES TO TOUR REGION

<P>
A Soviet oil-skimmer on Thursday began pumping up part of America's worst oil 
spill, while a second Cabinet officer began a tour of the region. 
</P>
<P>
The 425-foot Soviet skimmer Vaidogubsky began working at the mouth of 
Resurrection Bay, where streamers of oil that have escaped from Prince William 
Sound into the Gulf of Alaska were being scattered by strong wind and currents. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the skimmer was expected to move along the southern edge of the 
Kenai Peninsula, including Kenai Fjords National Park. State officials said oil 
up to six inches deep has been reported on beaches around Gore Point, about 90 
miles southwest of Seward. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. arrived Thursday in Valdez, headquarters of 
the cleanup effort and southern terminus of the trans-Alaska pipeline, from 
which the tanker Exxon Valdez was loaded with crude oil before ripping its hull 
on a reef 25 miles out into the sound on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
"We've obviously got the people and the technology, now it's a matter of will 
power to get the (cleanup) job done," Lujan said after visiting an otter 
cleaning center in Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to require massive resources and a lot of good judgment calls," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner came to Alaska on President Bush's 
behalf a week after the spill and said he was generally satisfied with Exxon's 
response. But he took a tougher stance when he testified before the Senate this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the oil industry's contingency spill response plan, Skinner said: 
"On the scale of one to 10, it was a zero." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet skimmer ship was called in because the small boats available in 
Alaska can handle seas only to about five feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOVIET OIL SKIMMING SHIP 
</P>
<P>
The Vaidogubsky, a 425-foot, oil skimmer/dredge, can capture 200,000 gallons of 
crude from the high seas each hour and can store up to 2 million gallons in its 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
1 -- The ship swings out long poles on each side. They attach to an 
oil-gathering boom which corrals oil as the vessel moves through the water. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Floating suction pumps or "weir" skimmers are then lowered into the 
captured oil. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- The oil is then pumped through hoses into the vessel's tanks.

SHOREHAM GETS OK TO OPERATE AT FULL POWER

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a full-power operating license to the 
controversial Shoreham nuclear power plant Thursday in a gesture that may 
ultimately prove to be symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 4 to 0 to grant the license, ending years of hearings that 
produced reams of testimony and cost millions of dollars. It is the first U.S. 
nuclear plant to be licensed on the basis of a utility-formulated emergency 
plan, rather than one created by the state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Island Lighting Co., which owns the 809-megawatt reactor, has agreed 
not to bring the plant up to full power pending a vote by shareholders to scrap 
the $5.5-billion plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Sell Plant for $1 
</P>
<P>
The vote, expected before June 15, will make or break a deal under which the 
company would sell Shoreham to New York state for $1 in exchange for a decade 
of annual rate increases. The state would then oversee the decommissioning and 
dismantling of the plant, which was once promoted as the solution to Long 
Island's energy shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Long Island Lighting was forced to draw up its own emergency evacuation plan 
after New York state, Suffolk County and the town of Southampton on Long Island 
withdrew support for the plant, contending that the zone around Shoreham could 
not be safely evacuated in case of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition kept Shoreham's request for a license tied up before the 
commission for years and led the NRC to change its rules in late 1987 to allow 
utilities to formulate evacuation plans under the assumption that state and 
local governments would cooperate in the event of a true emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Shoreham, situated about 90 miles east of New York City, was completed in 1984, 
more than 10 years behind schedule and almost 75 times over its original 
$75-million budget. The plant loaded fuel in January, 1985, and received a 5% 
low-power testing license in July, 1985.

PLATES LEAD TO ARREST OF KILLING SUSPECT

Sandra Sandor of Lake Elsinore said she first learned that a murder suspect was 
sleeping in her home when she turned on the radio Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast described the car and gave the license plate number of murder 
victim Denise Duerr, 21, of Garden Grove. Authorities had found Duerr's body 
near the Orange County-Riverside County line on Wednesday afternoon. She had 
been missing for two days. 
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that her car, with its personalized license plate CEEYA 3, 
still had not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Sandor remembered the unusual plates on the car that her husband's stepson, 
Cameron Seaholm, had driven to her Riverside County home when he showed up 
Monday for an unannounced visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I had noticed those license plates on the car he (Seaholm) was driving," 
Sandor said. "And when I heard the report on the radio this morning (Thursday), 
I went outside and checked the plates again. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I got my daughter, Kathy, into my bedroom, locked the door and called 
911," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested Seaholm, 22, on 
suspicion of murdering Duerr, with whom he had been friendly in high school. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sandor's daughter, Kathy Harrison, 29, Seaholm was calm and quiet 
during his three-day visit with them in Lake Elsinore. "He acted quite like the 
gentleman," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said Seaholm was asleep on a living room sofa in Sandor's home on 
Thursday morning when Sandor heard the radio newscast about the missing car. He 
was still asleep when sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested him, Harrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the alleged murder of Duerr were not immediately available from 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Duerr was last seen as she left her Garden Grove home in her Pontiac Fiero on 
Monday morning, headed to her job in Orange, about 15 minutes away by freeway. 
She never showed up for work. 
</P>
<P>
Her body was discovered in a ditch late Wednesday afternoon by a man walking 
his dog on a remote road in the Santa Ana Mountains. Authorities Thursday 
declined to give the cause of death.

An explosion and fire destroyed a 20,000-square-foot chemical storage shed at a 
recycling plant here Thursday morning, injuring several employees and 
incinerating at least two motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The blast rocked this high-desert town in San Bernardino County and hurled a 
column of smoke and flame hundreds of feet into the air, according to 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hyland, a dispatcher with the Hesperia Fire Department, said it was not 
immediately determined what caused the blast. He said it took 25 firefighters 
about three hours to extinguish the blaze at the Can Heaven plant in an 
industrial area of town. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland said several people sustained minor injuries, but he was was unable to 
provide further details.

C. LAMPKIN; VETERAN ACTOR AND EDUCATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Character actor Charles Lampkin, who played the bartender in the critically 
acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful "Frank's Place" television series and 
had guest spots on scores of other shows, has died in San Jose at age 76. 
</P>
<P>
Lampkin, an educator as well as an actor, died Monday after what was described 
by family spokesman Bill Barron as a lengthy illness. The Associated Press 
quoted a spokeswoman at Lampkin's agent's office as saying that heart failure 
was the apparent cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a musician as well as an actor and a very large and vocal exponent of 
education and knowledge," Barron said of Lampkin. "That was one of the first 
things he told young actors: 'You can't go anywhere without knowledge.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lampkin was a lecturer at the University of Santa Clara and at University of 
the Pacific, teaching dramatic arts and ethnic music. 
</P>
<P>
Lampkin may have been best known as bartender Tiger Shepin on "Frank's Place." 
The CBS series, a critical hit but low in the ratings, was canceled just before 
shooting was to have begun for its second season. 
</P>
<P>
Among Lampkin's other credits for television were "227," "Night Court," 
"Hunter," "Highway to Heaven," "The Jeffersons," "Webster," "Scarecrow and Mrs. 
King," "It Takes a Thief" and "That Girl." 
</P>
<P>
He also had appearances in feature films, including "Cocoon," "SOB," "Hello 
Dolly," "The Great White Hope," "Toys in the Attic" and "Watermelon Man." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Cleveland, Lampkin graduated from John Carroll University and the 
Cleveland School of Music. He learned acting at the Cleveland Playhouse.

GEORGE WHITMORE; WROTE ABOUT EFFECTS OF AIDS ON SOCIETY, HIMSELF

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Whitmore, an author and playwright who wrote about the effect of AIDS on 
society and on his friends, then finally about his own expected death from 
complications of the disease, died Wednesday at New York Medical Center at age 
43. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore wrote three plays -- "The Caseworker," "Flight -- The Legacy" and "The 
Rights" -- and two novels: "The Confessions of Danny Slocum," published in 1980 
by St. Martin's Press, and "Nebraska," published in 1987 by Grove Press. 
</P>
<P>
He began by writing about gays facing the traditional mores of American 
culture. As the menace of acquired immune deficiency syndrome evolved, he 
turned to the struggle for acceptance among his friends and finally to his own 
dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore also wrote "Reaching Out to Someone With AIDS" for The New York Times 
Magazine and later wrote a cover story for the magazine about his experience as 
an AIDS patient. In 1988 New American Library published his "Someone Was Here: 
Profiles in the AIDS Epidemic," an outgrowth of his magazine articles. 
</P>
<P>
He also became known for suing a Greenwich Village dental clinic that refused 
to treat him because he had AIDS. Northern Dispensary was fined $47,000 by the 
city's Human Rights Commission; last month, officials announced that, because 
of financial pressures, the clinic would close and reopen as a nursing home for 
AIDS patients under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Denver, Whitmore attended Bennington College and was a conscientious 
objector, choosing to work at Planned Parenthood of New York City in lieu of 
military service in the Vietnam War.

PLAYERS STILL CAN'T AGREE ON RULES IN STATE'S BUDGET NUMBERS GAME 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounded like a relatively simple request when Gov. George Deukmejian asked 
members of the Commission on State Finance to come to an agreement on what 
constitutes a balanced state budget. 
</P>
<P>
The exasperated Deukmejian, tired of what he called an "accountants' debate," 
asked the commission in February to resolve conflicting claims that the state 
had ended the 1987-88 fiscal year in the red. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Esoteric Issues 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, however, a special meeting of the commission to look into the 
problem produced a free-for-all debate over accounting practices, and it 
appeared that a simple answer would be a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the nearly two-hour debate by the seven members of the commission -- 
all but one of whom holds an elective office -- did indeed sound like an 
accountants' debate. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners discussed such esoteric accounting issues as encumbrances, 
disencumbrances, and carry-over appropriations. Boiled down, the debate 
centered on when state expenditures should be counted -- during the budget year 
when the appropriations are approved or when the actual payments are made, 
perhaps a year or two later? 
</P>
<P>
But the heart of the matter was politics. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican Deukmejian is on the hook -- put there by state Controller Gray 
Davis, one of the Democrats thinking about running next year to succeed 
Deukmejian, who has decided not to seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
Davis closed the books on 1987-88 reporting a $343-million deficit. He included 
as financial liabilities all of the contracts signed that year for goods and 
services (called encumbrances). The deficit resulted because the controller's 
books showed that available revenues were $343 million less than the legal 
appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
The controller subsequently was backed up by state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, 
acting Auditor General Kurt R. Sjoberg, and Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. 
Hill. The only dispute among them is the size of the deficit, which ranged from 
a low of $93 million to a high of $1.4 billion, depending on the method of 
accounting that was used. 
</P>
<P>
But the governor's budget continued to show that the state ended the year in 
the black, albeit by the razor-thin margin of $4 million. Knowing the state was 
close to the margin, Deukmejian Administration Finance Director Jesse R. Huff 
in January ordered all state departments that had not yet received goods 
contracted for during 1987-88 to cancel the contracts (a disencumbrance). Thus, 
he claims he was able to save at least $80 million and keep the state in the 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Davis disputed Huff's ability to save that much and said that even if he did, 
the books are closed and the deficit is now part of the historic record. 
</P>
<P>
And there the matter stood as Huff, Davis and the other five members of the 
commission sat down Thursday in a Capitol hearing room to see if they could 
reach an agreement on a method of reporting state expenses that would satisfy 
all parties. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat predictably, the meeting broke up after Democrats on the commission 
were caught by surprise by a motion made by Huff that basically would have put 
the commission on record as endorsing the accounting methods the finance 
director used in determining that the state ended 1987-88 in the black. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), chairman of the Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee, called the motion "patently political" and said he was 
"offended" that the finance director, who represents Deukmejian on the 
commission, made the motion without distributing copies of it to other 
commission members beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions About Motivation 
</P>
<P>
Davis argued against any changes in accounting, saying it "would unduly raise 
questions about our motivation and call the state's good name into question." 
</P>
<P>
The motion fell one vote short needed for passage when one of the four 
Republicans on the commission, Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville), 
refused to vote because of opposition from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Davis left the hearing room accusing Deukmejian of trying to "rewrite history." 
</P>
<P>
"The governor wants to somehow magically convert a deficit into a $4-million 
surplus, a feat that would make Merlin the magician proud," Davis said.

EX-SOLDIER WHO SOUGHT POWS ACQUITTED 
</P>

<P>
Retired Green Beret commander James (Bo) Gritz, best known for his unsuccessful 
missions into Southeast Asia in search of American POWs, was acquitted Thursday 
in federal court here on charges of misuse of a passport. 
</P>
<P>
It was, however, hardly an exoneration. Judge Philip Pro said in making a 
directed verdict that Gritz had simply been charged with the wrong crime. Pro 
called his ruling "unfortunate" and noted that there was "strong evidence" that 
Gritz, who faced a possible five-year prison term, violated other passport laws 
in making a 1986 journey to Burma under the assumed name of Richard Patrick 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Gritz, hardly chastened, said it was unfortunate that he never got the chance 
to tell the jury his story -- an extraordinary tale of conspiracy in which 
Gritz contends that CIA officials have blocked POW rescue efforts to cover up 
drug-dealing by those same officials. 
</P>
<P>
After chatting with the dismissed jurors, Gritz expressed confidence. "They 
(the jury) said to me . . . 'You are in our prayers,' " Gritz declared. "And I 
think that's the attitude of true Americans, not those bureaucrats in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in his old Army uniform, his chest festooned with medals and nine rows 
of colorful service ribbons, the Vietnam veteran had been expected to tell a 
courtroom filled with friends and veterans that his missions had been secretly 
sanctioned by the Reagan Administration. Gritz's attorneys said Texas 
billionaire H. Ross Perot, who has traveled to Hanoi to investigate the POW-MIA 
issue, was prepared to testify that he was present in the office of then-Vice 
President George Bush when Gritz got the assignment to search Burma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story Likened to Fiction 
</P>
<P>
Bill Maddox, the U.S. attorney for the state of Nevada, had planned to call two 
Bush Administration officials, Richard Childress and Tom Harvey, who would 
disavow Gritz's claims. Maddox, himself a Vietnam veteran, likened Gritz's 
story of meeting with Southeast Asian heroin warlord Khun Sa to such fiction as 
"The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors heard 1 1/2 days of testimony that suggested how Gritz, who lives about 
50 miles from here in Sandy Valley, Nev., obtained the passport for "Clark," a 
fictitious person, and how a 22-year-old Canadian customs inspector's 
suspicions led to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Before Gritz was called to testify, his attorney, Lamond Mills, asked Pro for a 
directed verdict. Federal prosecutors erred, Pro said, in charging Gritz not 
with falsely obtaining the passport, but with use of a passport "designed and 
issued for use by another." In fact, Pro suggested, the prosecution's case 
seemed to show that the bogus passport was indeed designed and issued for use 
by Gritz. 
</P>
<P>
"He was speeding and you charged him with driving on the wrong side of the 
road," Pro told Maddox. Maddox said he is considering whether to prosecute 
Gritz on other charges. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bittersweet kind of thing," Fran Masterson of Upland, Calif., one of 
Gritz's supporters, said of the acquittal. She wears a POW-MIA bracelet bearing 
the name of her husband, lost over Laos 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Masterson said she had hoped that Gritz and government officials would testify, 
figuring someone would commit perjury. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted this on the court record, because if somebody's lying about this, 
they should go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
Other Gritz supporters suggested that Pro's decision itself represented another 
part of a government plot to muzzle Gritz -- even though the acquittal was 
prompted on a motion by Gritz's attorneys.

NIGHT COURT;

<P>
JUDGE HOLDS MARATHON COURT SESSION TO CLEAR BACKLOG OF LAWYER'S CASES

<P>
Angered by the repeated delays in cases handled by defense attorney Jack Alex, 
prosecutors readied for a confrontation in Citrus Municipal Court in West 
Covina. 
</P>
<P>
In one case alone, they said, Alex obtained continuances 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes witnesses would forget key information, or disappear by the time 
their misdemeanor criminal cases came to trial. 
</P>
<P>
So this week, prosecutors made their move. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, they asked Municipal Judge Michael B. Rutberg to remove Alex as 
the attorney on six long-delayed cases on the docket that day. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge had a different idea. 
</P>
<P>
When court began Thursday morning, Rutberg ordered Alex, 60, to begin trying 
the cases immediately. And the jurist vowed to keep his courtroom open from 9 
a.m. to 9:30 p.m. for as many days as it would take to clear the backlog. 
</P>
<P>
But late Thursday, Robert O. Young, the presiding judge, issued a memo ordering 
an end to late-night court sessions after today. 
</P>
<P>
Young said, "Judge Rutberg is to be commended for his willingness to sacrifice 
his time by working a 12-hour day." But he added, "Such a work day is unfair 
and jeopardizes the mental and physical health of all personnel involved." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Alex, himself a former Citrus Municipal Court judge, had said he was 
prepared for the 12-hour days in court and was feeling up to the "challenge." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be fun for me," Alex said. "Let's see how many I can win." 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, a slightly rumpled Alex was picking a jury -- his third of the 
day -- and was already well into testimony on a drunk driving case. 
</P>
<P>
After Rutberg announced his marathon intentions, the district attorney's office 
assigned four prosecutors to handle Alex's cases and Rutberg called in extra 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Alex assured Rutberg that he could competently handle an assortment of 
misdemeanor cases at once, shifting from the defense of one accused drunk 
driver to another, and then on to such other matters as assault and petty 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Cases Straight 
</P>
<P>
Outside court early Thursday, Alex said he just hoped to keep the cases 
straight in his mind. He joked that he might find himself telling a jury that 
"I don't know why my client hit that woman with a frying pan," only to discover 
that the defendant is not charged with assault but drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Alex has been clogging the judicial system for years. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 cases alone, they said, he obtained 190 continuances, meaning that 
witnesses had to be subpoenaed repeatedly, police officers had been alerted to 
testify -- pushing up overtime -- and the deputy district attorneys themselves 
wasted time preparing the same cases over and over. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Diana L. Smith complained that misdemeanor cases handled by 
Alex, which should be settled in six months under the court's guidelines, often 
linger for a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, she said, one of his drunk driving cases was dismissed because 
the arresting officer had retired and moved away. 
</P>
<P>
She submitted to the court a transcript of another of his cases last year in 
which the deputy district attorney had to ask a judge to dismiss a drunk 
driving charge, noting the case was so old that the arresting officers were 
"unable to remember independently from their police report the incident." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Delaying Cases 
</P>
<P>
Alex denied that he deliberately delays cases, insisting that often when he is 
ready for trial, the prosecution is not. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney said the district attorney's office is upset because of 
his success in winning cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 32 jury trials last year and I won about 30 of them," Alex said. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith disputed his claim, saying her records show that Alex is on a 
six-case losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of court Thursday, she urged Rutberg to replace Alex on the six 
scheduled cases, instead of ordering the trials to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"No attorney, whether it's Mr. Alex or F. Lee Bailey or attorney X can try 
these cases (simultaneously) and represent their clients in the manner 
prescribed by law," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orders Trials to Go On 
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, said that he had no right to replace Alex and that he was 
ordering the trials to go on in response to Smith's argument that the cases 
should not be delayed further. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those jury trials in Rutberg's court, Alex had cases scheduled 
in three other Citrus courtrooms Thursday. The district attorney's office 
sought to remove Alex as attorney in two of those cases, but judges also 
rejected the motions. 
</P>
<P>
Such requests to remove an attorney are rare, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The backlog of cases has been a longstanding concern in the Citrus court 
system, Presiding Judge Young said, and focusing on continuances that have been 
granted to Alex oversimplifies a complex problem. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that, in his experience, the prosecution causes as many delays in 
trials as the defense. And if everyone demanded a speedy trial, the Citrus 
court system would not have the courtrooms or the judges to handle the 
caseload, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our volume is such that we have to be generous in granting continuances," 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Alex served as a Citrus judge for six years, until he was defeated for 
reelection by Young in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, he was a deputy district attorney in charge of the El Monte 
branch. His wife, Nida Brinkis, is his law partner.

NEW ANTI-TERRORISM LAW USED AGAINST L.A. GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and BOB BAKER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police across Los Angeles County on Thursday began serving legal notices to 
3,700 reputed street gang members, warning them that membership in criminal 
gangs is now a felony under a new state anti-terrorism law. 
</P>
<P>
The novel attempt to curb gangs was announced by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, Los 
Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn and representatives of eight law enforcement 
agencies, including the Sheriff's Department and the police departments of Los 
Angeles, Compton, Long Beach, Montebello, Pomona, Pasadena and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Gang investigators in those jurisdictions have targeted nine troublesome street 
gangs and have instructed patrol officers to serve a printed summation of the 
new law to each suspected member of those gangs whenever they are spotted 
during routine patrol or arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Recipients of the notices will be asked to sign a form acknowledging that they 
have been served. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, one of nearly a 
dozen state anti-gang laws that took effect in January, members of "criminal 
street gangs" can be prosecuted on an additional charge of gang membership once 
they are arrested on suspicion of a gang-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
The additional charge could be brought against any gang member who had been 
served with the notices now being distributed by law officials. Gang members 
who had not been served could still face extra jail or state prison time for 
gang-related crimes if they were found to meet the criteria of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
However, the law does not allow the prosecution of a gang member for membership 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
The law targets "any person who actively participates in a criminal street gang 
with knowledge that its members have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang 
activity and who willfully promotes or assists any felonious conduct by members 
of that gang." Punishment can be as much as three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal gang is defined as one in which two or more members have committed 
two or more offenses within three years, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael 
Genelin, the head of the D.A.'s hard-core gang section. Offenses include 
assault with a deadly weapon, robbery, homicide, sale of narcotics, arson and 
shooting at occupied dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of how the law will be implemented, Reiner said the owner of a 
car or a weapon used in a drive-by shooting could be prosecuted under the law 
even if he had not otherwise participated in the act. 
</P>
<P>
There were 452 murders by gang members in Los Angeles County last year, a 16.7% 
increase over 1987. In the first quarter of this year there were 78 killings in 
the city of Los Angeles alone. About half the victims were innocent bystanders, 
according to Reiner. Gang investigators say there are an estimated 70,000 gang 
members in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drafted by Reiner's Staff 
</P>
<P>
The new anti-gang law was drafted by Reiner's staff and carried in the 
Legislature by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore 
(D-Los Angeles). Reiner said the law gives authorities a unique tool "to rid 
the streets of hoodlums that are terrorizing and killing our citizens." 
However, he acknowledged that the tactic is "not the be-all and end-all" in the 
fight against gangs. 
</P>
<P>
For years, criminal justice experts have struggled to devise laws that could 
cope with street gang activity by treating it as a form of organized crime. 
They have been frustrated by the fact that while gang crime often grows out of 
association among gang members, most street gangs lack the classic organization 
associated with criminal institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Hahn's office filed a civil lawsuit against one gang in West Los 
Angeles, the Playboy Gangster Crips, asking that members be banned from 
associating with one another. However, a judge refused, calling that request 
"too broad." 
</P>
<P>
The judge allowed other portions of the injunction to stand, including 
prohibitions against entering private property without permission, blocking 
access to streets and harassing or threatening residents. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner and Hahn said use of the new law may be expanded in coming months. Hahn, 
looking into a battery of television cameras at the curb-side press conference 
held in front of a graffiti-covered public library at 43rd Place and Olive 
Street, urged gang members to "check it out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Have the Jail Space' 
</P>
<P>
But a veteran gang investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, 
"I don't think gang members are going to be particularly scared of this law. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another good tool, but between me and you we got more laws than Carter's 
got liver pills right now. We can fill up the jails with gang members, but we 
don't have the jail space to keep them." 
</P>
<P>
Another law enforcement officer with extensive gang experience said he fears 
the law will be applied too broadly because expertise among officers assigned 
to identify gang members is not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that we have to do something, but when you have carte blanche, it's 
difficult not to abuse it," the lawman said. 
</P>
<P>
The press conference to publicize enforcement of the new law attracted many 
neighborhood residents, most of whom hailed the new effort. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was George Walker, plant manager of the West Vernon Elementary 
School across the street from the library. He complained that street gang 
members often trespass onto the school grounds after dark, threatening the 
safety of his staff and the school's faculty. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's almost unbearable," Walker told Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on it," Reiner told him.

L.A. COUNTY FIRMS BLAMED FOR 40% OF TOXIC EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County industries released 29.7 million pounds of hazardous 
chemicals into the environment in 1987, representing 40% of all toxic emissions 
into the air, water and ground in the state that year, according to a study 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The study by the California Public Interest Research Group analyzed records 
filed by 636 Los Angeles County companies last July under a new, 
Bhopal-inspired federal community-right-to-know law. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, manufacturing firms must disclose the amount of toxic chemicals 
they emit routinely and by accidental leaks or evaporation into the air, water 
and ground, and the amount they transport to dump facilities elsewhere. The 
total for both categories for the county was more than 91.7 million pounds, or 
11 pounds per person. 
</P>
<P>
By chemical, the consumer advocacy group's study found that 12.8 million pounds 
of the toxics emitted have been linked to cancer. About 25 million pounds are 
suspected of causing birth defects, sterility or genetic mutations, and another 
53.6 million pounds have been linked to damage to internal organs and the 
central or peripheral nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
Estimating the precise health risks of these emissions is difficult, however, 
because the reports do not specify such factors as wind conditions or the 
concentrations and timing of the emissions. Without this information, it is 
impossible to know the degree to which people were exposed to the chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is responsible 
for enforcing the law, said at the time it took effect that the disclosures 
would give the public "a hint" of what to be concerned about but would not 
provide enough information "to know whether you should be scared or not." 
</P>
<P>
"Release does not equal exposure. . . ," EPA spokeswoman Alicia Tenuta said 
Thursday. "It may seem very, very scary, but you can't jump to conclusions. Did 
it (the chemical) go all at once or just a little bit every day? What I am 
trying to say is that you cannot assume all the chemical went right into your 
house." 
</P>
<P>
The consumer group, known as CALPIRG, contends that the overall amounts are so 
large and many of the chemicals so toxic that it is reasonable to conclude that 
the emissions are hurting public health. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have almost 100 million pounds of toxics being released (and 
transported) in L.A. County, with its population density, the exposure is going 
to be extreme," said Mary Raftery, co-author of the report. "With the amounts 
this large, there is no question there's an extreme risk." 
</P>
<P>
The right-to-know law was passed by Congress in response to the deaths of more 
than 2,000 people from a poisonous gas leak in a Union Carbide factory in 
Bhopal, India. It requires firms that manufacture or use at least 10,000 pounds 
of one or more of 325 chemicals specified as potentially hazardous by the EPA 
to report their emissions on an annual basis. The firms include food, tobacco, 
textiles, petroleum, printing, metals, rubber and plastic companies that have 
10 or more full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Chemicals 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals whose emissions must be reported include methanol, which in large 
quantities can cause blindness and at low levels may be associated with 
neurological effects; butyl alcohol, which is toxic if consumed but is 
generally considered safe to breath in low quantities, and perchloroethylene, a 
solvent known to cause cancer in animals. 
</P>
<P>
Firms within the city limits of Los Angeles released more chemicals into the 
environment than any other city in the county. Los Angeles was followed by 
Torrance, Van Nuys, El Segundo, Monrovia and Long Beach, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon led the county in total pounds of toxics both emitted and transported by 
trucks or pipes off the company site. Vernon was followed by Los Angeles, 
Wilmington, Torrance, Santa Fe Springs and El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, Orange County was second to Los Angeles in pounds of toxics released 
and transported, followed by San Bernardino, Humboldt, Alameda, Contra Costa, 
Santa Clara and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
The emissions into water, such as canals, were from pipes, open trenches, waste 
water treatment facilities and storm water runoff. By ground, the toxics were 
either injected underground into wells at the firms or transferred to public or 
privately owned storage, disposal and treatment plants. By air, the chemicals 
were emitted from such sources as building ventilation systems and smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
CALPIRG is trying to build support for state legislation sponsored by 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda) to require companies to report their use 
of toxics and the amounts of toxic byproducts they generate. The federal law 
requires disclosure only of toxic releases and transportation of toxic 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The organization also is backing a bill by Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin 
(D-Fremont) to establish an institute to promote research into reducing use of 
toxic chemicals and to assist businesses in reduction techniques. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOXIC CHEMICALS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Interest Research Group ranked cities according to the 
total of toxic chemicals released directly into the atmosphere in 1987 and the 
combined total of chemicals released and transferred to waste sites or into 
sewage systems. The chemicals included 325 types considered by the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency to pose a threat to the environment and public 
health. Amounts are expressed in pounds.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MALIBU SEWER BOND SALE IS ALLOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge refused Thursday to bar the county from selling $39 
million in bonds to finance a sewer system in Malibu, contending the sale would 
not hurt homeowners trying to block the construction of a sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
The county plans to sell the 12% interest bonds in a high-risk offering now, 
rather than risking higher interest rates by waiting until a court rules on the 
homeowners' lawsuit to stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
John Murdock, a lawyer for the Malibu Township Council, a community group that 
sought to block the bond sale, said that the 12% rate hurts homeowners, who 
will have to pay higher sewer assessments to pay off the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"It also creates an impression on the part of other agencies, such as the state 
Coastal Commission, that the issuance of bonds is somehow an indication that 
the project is going to succeed," Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Kurt Lewin said homeowners will not be hurt by the sale of bonds 
because they already have received assessment notices. Lewin said he doubted 
that other agencies would feel sympathy for the county if it is obligated to 
honor bonds for a sewer system that is rejected by the court.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE MISCONDUCT TERMED 'EPIDEMIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing their own statistics, several civil liberties groups have alleged that 
police misconduct in the city and county of Los Angeles has reached "epidemic 
proportions" and have called for formation of citizen review boards, 
appointment of special prosecutors and legislative hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a coalition of civil and human rights organizations made the charges 
at a press conference in front of Parker Center. The Los Angeles Police 
Department quickly responded by saying that there has been a 322% decrease in 
complaints of excessive force filed with the department over the last three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
That includes 652 complaints filed in 1988 with the Police Misconduct Lawyer 
Referral Service, a private nonprofit organization that has staged "sting" 
operations aimed at exposing police misconduct. The civil liberties groups said 
there was a 198% increase of such complaints against the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
But Lt. Fred Nixon, an LAPD spokesman, said there were 293 excessive force 
complaints filed last year, down from 356 in 1987. "If you compare those 
numbers, rather than a dramatic increase, you see an actual decrease of nearly 
18%," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT ARRESTED IN CATALINA KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 41-year-old Avalon man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 
34-year-old woman friend in what authorities said was the first homicide on 
Santa Catalina Island in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Edward Kingman was flown Thursday afternoon to Long Beach and then driven 
to the Lakewood Sheriff's Station, where he was being held without bail in the 
death of the woman, whose name was not released pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said that Kingman telephoned at about 4 a.m. Thursday for 
paramedics, who found the woman's body outside a trailer on Pebbly Beach Road. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman said that he and the woman had argued, and that she was injured when 
she slipped and fell on a wooden patio, deputies said. Authorities declined to 
provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
A former constable on the island and a sheriff's deputy on Catalina said there 
has not been a murder case on the resort island since the 1940s. A woman who 
shot and killed an intruder in the early 1960s was convicted of involuntary 
manslaughter, said Fern Whelan, clerk of the Santa Catalina Justice Court.

CLEANING UP THEIR ACT; 
</P>
<P>
SPRAY-PAINT VANDALS SENTENCED TO REMOVE GRAFFITI UNDER NEW COURT POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old gang member, leaning on the back of a graffiti cleanup truck 
Thursday, acknowledged that putting gang markings on walls is a lot easier than 
taking them off. 
</P>
<P>
"You 'strike up' a wall without really thinking about it. You just do it 
because there is nothing better to do," he said of his past work with a can of 
spray paint. "When you've got to clean it off, then you know it takes a lot of 
work and it costs a lot of money. It makes you think." 
</P>
<P>
He should know. After pleading guilty to misdemeanor vandalism this month after 
his arrest for defacing a park wall, he was sentenced to 100 hours of community 
service -- cleaning graffiti off public buildings, buses and structures. 
</P>
<P>
The young man's lesson is one that authorities hope to begin teaching more 
often. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials announced Thursday that ordering vandals to "clean up 
their own mess" will become a sentencing standard in a new effort to crack down 
on the graffiti problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to vigorously prosecute these individuals," City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre said during a press conference at a graffiti-marred bus stop 
on Kingston Avenue near downtown. "We are going to force the individuals to 
clean up their own mess. We have gotten to the point in this city that we are 
tired of spending the money" to hire cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said that more than $50 million is spent in California each year to 
clean up graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RTD Spends $8 Million 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District spends about $8 million annually 
to clean its fleet of 2,400 buses. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, flanked by representatives of the RTD, Los Angeles police and the 
city attorney's office, said previous efforts to crack down on inner city 
graffiti were "haphazard." The new effort will have "all of the components" of 
the criminal justice system working together, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first step, officials agree, is catching more of the vandals. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said RTD police have created a graffiti task force and Los Angeles 
police will also increase efforts to catch vandals. But they declined to reveal 
specific methods that will be used. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ferber, assistant supervisor of the city attorney's gang unit, said his 
office will now routinely seek a two-part sentence for individuals convicted of 
the misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to go for as much jail time as we can get. And no matter what we 
get, we are going to insist that (the defendants) be forced to clean up the 
graffiti," Ferber said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime R. Corral, presiding judge of the Northeast Juvenile Justice Center, said 
several judges have ordered vandals to clean up their own graffiti in the past, 
but the new effort will make such orders a matter of policy. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids will be automatically expected to do some graffiti cleanup," he 
said. "It will be a deterrent, we hope." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Anderson, the justice center's coordinator of programs for juvenile 
offenders, also praised the new effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me another place to put kids where the punishment is more 
appropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Civic organizations such as Community Youth Gang Services will supervise the 
graffiti cleanups, officials said. Alatorre said the city has set aside 
$500,000 to fund the organizations that will handle the supervision. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's press conference, a Youth Gang Services team set to work 
cleaning graffiti off the walls at the Kingston Avenue bus stop. One member of 
the team was the 20-year-old gang member. He declined to give his name. He said 
he had been arrested for painting the initials of his gang, Marijuanos Locos 
Sur, on a wall in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He said it will probably take him three weeks to work off his 100 hours of 
community service and added that his graffiti-writing days are over. 
</P>
<P>
"It has gotten me off the walls," he said. "I won't drop out of the gang, no. 
But I think I'll leave the graffiti to the younger guys after this."

B OF A'S 1ST-QUARTER PROFIT SETS RECORD AT $275 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BankAmerica's remarkable recovery gathered momentum in the first quarter of 
this year, with profits rising to a record $275 million and solid progress 
reported in key areas. 
</P>
<P>
The parent of Bank of America said Thursday that its first-quarter profits were 
152% higher than in the same period of 1988 and $10 million higher than in the 
last quarter of that year. 
</P>
<P>
Although one-time gains helped boost the bottom line, real improvements were 
posted in net interest income, domestic loan quality and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
As a reward for their role in the turnaround at the nation's third-largest 
banking company, B of A provided about 50,000 employees with 10 shares of stock 
each during the quarter at a total cost of $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Line by line, it performed better than I expected and, by the time you get to 
the bottom line, it was quite a bit better overall," said Donald K. Crowley, a 
bank analyst in the San Francisco office of the Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods 
investment firm.

Plagued by loan losses and operating problems, BankAmerica was deep in the red 
for three consecutive years, culminating in a $955-million loss in 1987. But 
last year the company rebounded with profits of $726 million. 
</P>
<P>
The first quarter indicates that the pace of the progress is picking up at the 
San Francisco banking company. And Frank N. Newman, the chief financial 
officer, said he sees no reason for the fundamental progress to slow in the 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The most impressive aspect of Thursday's report was the sheer size of the 
profits. The $275 million was higher than in any quarter in bank history, even 
during the salad years of the 1970s when Bank of America was the world's 
biggest bank. 
</P>
<P>
The chief component of the increase was a 26% hike in net interest income, 
which rose to $987 million from $779 million in the first quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Interest income got a boost from $46 million in interest from Brazil, which 
counted as a one-time item because the Brazilian loans are still listed as 
non-performing. But even without that interest, the income was up $162 million 
over last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tax credits associated with previous losses added another $67 million to 
profits in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of progress, analyst Crowley said, was a strong increase in fees 
from service charges on deposit accounts, such as the new fees for automated 
teller transactions. The increase helped boost noninterest income to $436 
million from $424 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
While the increase was small, it reversed several quarters of flat or declining 
noninterest income that had resulted from the bank's sale of revenue-producing 
assets to cope with its losses. 
</P>
<P>
On the credit quality side, net loan losses dropped to $27 million from $30 
million, reflecting $127 million in loan losses and $100 million in recoveries 
from loans previously written off as lost. The figure has been low for several 
quarters because the bank has been recovering substantial amounts from loans 
previously written off, and Newman acknowledged that recoveries are likely to 
decline in future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Stephen Berman of County NatWest Securities in New York said his 
calculations showed that BankAmerica's domestic problem loans dropped $200 
million in the quarter, the best among the nation's biggest banks. In contrast, 
he said, Citicorp in New York added $400 million in real estate construction 
loans to its list of non-performing loans in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Noninterest expense, which covers such items as staff and equipment, was $949 
million, up $16 million from the first quarter of last year. Without two 
one-time costs, expenses would have declined $38 million, largely through the 
elimination of 4,400 jobs in the last 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
One of the special items was the $19 million for stock awards to employees. The 
other was an additional set-aside of $35 million to cover potential losses from 
the bank's role in problems related to $1.4 billion in student loans. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the world's largest banks sued B of A this week, charging that it is 
responsible for losses as high as $650 million because federal guarantees on 
the student loans were voided by mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
B of A set aside $80 million to $90 million for the problem in the fourth 
quarter of 1988. The bank actually set aside more than $35 million in the first 
quarter of this year, but declined to disclose the total sum, which included 
recoveries from other lawsuits. Analysts estimated that the bank has provided 
close to $150 million so far to deal with the problem.

WEST GERMANS PUSH UP 2 KEY LENDING RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Germany's central bank pushed up two key lending rates Thursday, sending 
U.S. financial markets into a brief tailspin and abruptly ending a week-old 
rally that had been fueled by speculation that the Federal Reserve might allow 
U.S. interest rates to fall. 
</P>
<P>
The German action, which caught traders by surprise, provided another sign of 
how intertwined global financial markets have become in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The move apparently surprised President Bush as well and could lead to renewed 
tensions between West Germany and the Administration over international 
economic policies aimed at quelling inflation and stabilizing the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Complained to Reporters 
</P>
<P>
When the German announcement came, Bush had just finished arguing to reporters 
that the recent budget agreement with Congress deserved credit for sparking a 
stock market rally and that interest rates remained unnecessarily high, despite 
the budget action. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased with the market reaction to the budget agreement," Bush 
told a group of reporters. But he added: "I'm not heartened by the interest 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, many market traders were reported to be disappointed that the 
budget agreement had made only a modest dent in the federal deficit, while 
papering over most differences between Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush complained to reporters that the link between the budget accord and the 
market rally had been "under-reported" in the press. Most analysts, however, 
contend that the recent rally in the stock and bond markets was sparked by last 
Friday's reports on consumer prices and housing, which showed the economy 
slowing and encouraged hopes that the Federal Reserve would ease its grip on 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
The German Bundesbank, by raising its discount rate to 4.5% from 4% and its 
Lombard rate to 6.5% from 6.0%, dashed those hopes. The discount rate is a 
benchmark for other rates, and the Lombard rate is the rate at which the 
Bundesbank lends to banks against securities pledged as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Market Surprised 
</P>
<P>
Only last week, Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger had said the 
central bank saw no need to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The German move caught the bond market with its pants down," said Lyle 
Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor who is now chief economist at the 
Mortgage Bankers Assn. "Traders had been swept up in a mood of euphoria over 
signs of the softening economy, but the Bundesbank action brought them down to 
earth by reminding us that the Fed has very limited freedom to reduce interest 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices dropped abruptly and interest rates moved higher after the West 
German move, but rates eased slightly later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the stock market fell sharply in early trading. But the Dow Jones 
industrial average, which had been down as much as 20 points, ended off 9.53 
for the day at 2,377.38 after rising by 90.91 points in the four previous 
trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell sharply, hitting its lowest level against the mark since 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
The West German rate increases, which helped pull money out of the dollar by 
making German financial instruments more attractive to investors, were echoed 
almost immediately by the Dutch and Austrian central banks. 
</P>
<P>
A French official said his government has no plans to match the Bundesbank 
move. The French Ministry of Economics official told the Associated Press, 
however, that France might raise lending rates if the franc's stability is 
threatened.

PACTEL AGREES TO BUY AN OPTION ON CHICAGO CABLE TV OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to become the first regional Bell telephone company in domestic cable 
television, Pacific Telesis Group agreed Thursday to acquire an option on 68% 
of a cable operation in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based parent of Pacific Bell would pay $650,000 a year for a 
four-year option on the stake. Prime Cable has an agreement in principle to buy 
the entire Chicago operation, which has 97,000 subscribers, from Group W 
Satellite Communications for $198 million. Prime Cable is to sell a 68% 
interest to its financial partner, Transamerica Corp., which has agreed to sell 
the option to Pacific Telesis. 
</P>
<P>
The deal faces a major hurdle: A federal court decree has banned the so-called 
Baby Bell companies, including Pacific Telesis, from providing cable service 
anywhere in the United States. The company said it will ask for a waiver of the 
5-year-old decree's provisions for the Chicago operation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Justice Department has OKd the deal, the company must have the 
approval of U.S. District Judge Harold Greene. The judge oversees the 
administration of the 1984 order, which set the terms for the breakup of the 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph system. 
</P>
<P>
The current price of Pacific Telesis' 68% interest in the Chicago operation 
would be $134.6 million, a spokeswoman said, but interest rates and the 
appreciation in value of cable properties would increase that price over time. 
</P>
<P>
The deal drew an immediate response from the cable television industry, which 
has expressed fear that regional phone systems could be used to compete 
unfairly with cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
The National Cable Television Assn. in Washington said it will oppose the 
waiver. The decree "is premised on justifiable fears of telephone companies 
using their huge monopoly phone business to cross-subsidize and otherwise 
impede competition," said President James P. Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the biggest cable operator, Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, 
does not oppose involvement of telephone companies in cable business as long as 
it is outside their own service areas. Vice President Robert Thompson said 
Thursday, however, that TCI "does not feel strongly enough to make an issue of 
it" with the association's majority. 
</P>
<P>
His firm's "real concern," added Thompson, is that a phone company -- as a 
regulated monopoly -- could "cross-subsidize" a cable service in its own area, 
meaning that profits of the phone system could be used to subsidize unfairly 
low cable rates. That, he said, would be "of serious and dramatic concern to 
everyone in the cable industry and, I suspect, regulators and legislators." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the National Assn. of Broadcasters and a consumer advocate 
told a congressional committee this month that the cable industry itself is a 
monopoly that should be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis, which invested last year in a London cable TV operation, said 
"the Chicago franchises are a logical extension of our cable venture in 
London." 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Sharon Armbrust of Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel said: "A waiver 
doesn't mean a free-for-all entry, but it's a start."

S. J. DIAMOND: THE AFTER-TAX IRRITANT: HOW TO STORE RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the pain of filing tax returns passes, the need to store the records 
is a continuing irritant. One must decide what to keep, and how long to keep 
it, or, leaping over indecision, just keep it all -- usually in drawers or 
boxes already full of four, 10, even 20 years of tax records. 
</P>
<P>
Annually, tax preparers, the IRS and the media reiterate that the statute of 
limitation for an IRS challenge is three years, six years under certain 
circumstances, unlimited only in the case of fraud. Nevertheless, confused or 
fearful, we keep it all forever. 
</P>
<P>
The general rules seem straightforward: The IRS must examine income tax returns 
and assess additional taxes within three years from the due date or the date of 
filing, whichever comes later. If the taxpayer understated gross income by more 
than 25% of the amount reported, however, the IRS has another three years -- 
six in all -- to make its challenges. And if no return is filed, or the return 
is fraudulent, there's no statute of limitations on IRS action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Not Frauds 
</P>
<P>
Now, all those people who keep records forever aren't necessarily frauds, 
although they may shade facts in their favor, or may be, as tax preparers say, 
"aggressive" in their claims. But they recognize that to some extent, fraud is 
in the eye of the judge, that some of the IRS's 120,000 employees are bound to 
be overzealous, and they fear a fraud charge, and a future fight. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it's a serious charge, with harsh penalties. Civil penalties are 75% of 
the additional tax owed, plus an additional 50% of any interest due -- these 
assessed by the IRS examiners, with Tax Court making final judgment if the 
taxpayer appeals. A case can also be referred for criminal investigation, and 
thence for prosecution by the Justice Department in federal court, with a 
possible fine or jail time added on. 
</P>
<P>
But use of the term "fraud" is not casual: It's not negligence or ignorance of 
the law. There must be intent to evade taxes, a "bad purpose," in the words of 
Manuel Godinez, a group manager in the IRS's criminal investigation division, 
Los Angeles District, and the burden of proving that intent is on the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Degree of Bad Purpose' 
</P>
<P>
The difference between criminal and civil cases, says Godinez, is "the degree 
of bad purpose," and relatively few become criminal cases. In 1988, when 194.3 
million tax returns were filed (107 million individual), Criminal Investigation 
sent only 3,044 cases for prosecution. "We have to be selective because we're 
the smallest (IRS) division," says Godinez, "and our cases can take 18 months. 
For every 10 to 15 referrals, we'll accept one." 
</P>
<P>
Almost half involved narcotics, money-laundering, fraudulent tax shelters or 
illegal tax protesters. The selection depends partly on the degree of bad 
purpose, partly on publicity value and current political concerns. Many cases 
are headliners, "which tell Joe Blow Taxpayer that we don't just go after the 
little guys, but will take on the big ones, too," says Rob Giannangeli, IRS 
spokesman in Los Angeles. A recent example: hotel magnates Leona and Harry 
Helmsley, accused of tax fraud after the IRS claimed they diverted millions of 
corporate dollars to the decorating of their private mansion (jade artwork, 
landscaping, marble dance floors), and deducted them as business expenditures 
from corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Civil fraud penalties are somewhat more common -- 9,304 assessed in 1988 -- but 
still selective. 
</P>
<P>
Overstating the business value of some $10 lunches may simply lose a taxpayer 
the deductions; a fraud case requires, says Giannangeli, "some sort of 
definitive act, like keeping two sets of books, altering documents, claiming 
dependents that don't exist, making unex plained bank deposits, or listing 
property in relatives' names." Intent must be provable -- the difference, says 
Giannangeli, between giving a watch to charity estimated at $5,000 when it's 
later appraised at $2,500, and getting a $2,500 appraisal and then claiming 
it's a $5,000 gift. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Tax Court rulings demonstrate stringent standards for judging intent. 
Large understatements of income have not alone been able to prove fraud, nor 
has "gross neglect" of bookkeeping procedures, nor did the behavior of a 
taxpayer who filed no returns for given years until called in, produced no 
books or records until the trial, and then gave inconsistent testimony. 
</P>
<P>
But fraud was found in the case of a taxpayer who claimed theft losses on a 
Picasso painting that the government proved didn't exist. Similarly, the court 
ruled fraudulent a neurosurgeon's understatements of income, given the deposits 
into his personal checking account of practice fees that had not been recorded, 
and a regular $1,000 error -- 13 times in two years -- in the addition of his 
monthly receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Such judgments may reassure ordinary people who save all tax records in case 
they're ever accused of fraud. Someone trying to perpetrate a fraud will 
probably keep no records at all, since no records can prove their assertions. 
</P>
<P>
As for everyone else, says Shirley Nakagawa, IRS spokesman in the Los Angeles 
District, "If you think you might need to explain something, or you're being 
audited and haven't gotten an audit report when the three years is almost 
expired, then you'd better keep everything a while longer." 
</P>
<P>
Fraud considerations aside, one should routinely keep anything, says 
Giannangeli, that "has bearing on the future," if not current taxes. Certain 
records, in IRS words, verify "the basis of property," or what the taxpayer put 
into it. When a home, for example, is sold, and the proceeds reported, 
computation of taxable capital gains takes into account all monies put into it. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, one should keep records of any investment not yet matured or 
liquidated -- stocks, bonds, IRAs, partnerships, art and jewelry collections -- 
and not just for the IRS. Such information can establish a later sale price, or 
back up an insurance claim. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the tax returns themselves, generally kept for seven years by 
the IRS (given those six-year limitations), and for the rest of their lives by 
taxpayers, even those who discard the background documentation. After all, old 
returns might some day provide guidance, or curiosity value, and they take up 
little room.

SCE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
CREATION OF LARGEST U.S. GAS-ELECTRIC UTILITY A STEP CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SCEcorp Chairman Howard Allen's dream of creating the nation's largest gas and 
electric utility took another step toward reality Thursday when shareholders of 
Southern California Edison and SCEcorp, its parent company, voted to merge San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric into Edison. 
</P>
<P>
"This is another important milestone," Allen told the more than 1,000 
shareholders who gathered Thursday to vote at a City of Industry hotel. Holders 
of the parent corporation's common stock voted overwhelmingly to approve the 
merger, as did holders of the utility company's preference and preferred stock, 
according to Edison spokesman David Barron. 
</P>
<P>
Allen told shareholders that the proposed merger would produce $1.7 billion in 
cost savings between 1990 and 2000, most of which would be used to reduce rates 
for customers throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The merger that is expected to produce lower rates and better service for 
customers will also improve shareholder value in the long run, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
That increased value will develop because the merged companies, with 4.8 
million customers, will be better prepared to handle anticipated growth in 
Southern California, Allen said. Shareholders will benefit because Edison would 
control SDG&amp;E's service franchises in southern Orange and northern San 
Diego counties, which boast the state's fastest growth rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Desirable Customer Mix' 
</P>
<P>
The two counties have the "kind of desirable customer mix" that Edison needs to 
balance the large commercial and industrial customers who increasingly have 
been leaving the Edison system and building their own power-generation plants, 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed by shareholder Rosemarie Reynolds, Allen vowed that the merger 
would not force SCEcorp, which is based in Rosemead, to alter its dividend 
policy. However, Allen was unable to predict when the company's stock would 
recoup the 7% dilution that will occur if the stock-swap merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Allen also discounted the firestorm of protest that the merger has generated in 
San Diego County, where the water authority has earmarked $100,000 to study a 
possible government takeover of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
That protest is being led by a "small group of well-intentioned people" who are 
running a largely emotional campaign against the merger, Allen said. The 
anti-merger push "is damaging San Diego in the eyes of business leaders 
nationally," said Allen, who complained that anti-merger proponents have 
ignored "the facts" and instead concentrated on "an emotional approach . . . of 
San Diego against Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting was interrupted briefly when about two dozen protesters from 
the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Crusade began to chant anti-Edison slogans 
outside the meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terse Exchange 
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session, Danny J. Bakewell Sr., the group's 
president, repeatedly pressed Allen to modify the way that Edison makes 
charitable donations. Allen agreed to meet with Bakewell, but during a terse 
exchange, the executive told Bakewell to sit down and let other shareholders 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
Bakewell, who identified himself as an SCEcorp shareholder, subsequently 
complained that Allen had "simply kissed us off, ignored us." 
</P>
<P>
The brief demonstration, however, was the only unplanned event at the closely 
scripted meeting. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E shareholders Tuesday approved the merger that now must be approved by 
various regulators, including the state Public Utilities Commission and the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting in San Diego, 61% of SDG&amp;E's common stock 
shareholders approved the merger. Holders of SDG&amp;E preference and preferred 
stock voted in favor by 67.3%. Approval of the merger required a simple 
majority vote of common shareholders and two-thirds of the preference and 
preferred stock holders. 
</P>
<P>
According to terms of the merger agreement, SDG&amp;E shareholders will receive 
1.3 shares of Edison stock for each share of SDG&amp;E. That stock swap is 
expected to generate a 23% premium for each share of SDG&amp;E common stock. It 
would boost SDG&amp;E common stock dividends by 24% and boost the book value 
per share of each SDG&amp;E common share by 29%, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
SCEcorp closed at $32.125, down .125. SDG&amp;E closed at $37.875, also down 
.125.

maker, failed in his bid for an immediate seat on its board, the company 
president said. In a meeting with president Takao Matsuura and other officers, 
Pickens, who holds a 20.2% stake, outlined his desire to participate in the 
management of the company and requested a seat on the board. But company 
officials declined to give him an immediate answer.

DISNEY'S EISNER HAS TOP SALARY AT $40.1 MILLION

Walt Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner, who orchestrated the company's 
transformation into a multimedia entertainment titan, earned $40.1 million in 
1988, putting him at the top of Business Week's list of highest-paid corporate 
bosses, the magazine said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Right behind him is Disney's president, Frank G. Wells, who garnered $32.1 
million, the magazine reported in its May 1 edition. The bulk of money earned 
by Eisner and Wells came from stock options they exercised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Surprise 
</P>
<P>
Business Week said the biggest surprise in its 39th annual survey of executive 
pay in the United States was that the average salary and bonus for chief 
executive officers topped $1 million for the first time, and the average total 
compensation exceeded $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 354 corporations found the average CEO's salary and bonus rose to 
nearly $1.13 million, an increase of 17% over a year earlier. Stock options and 
long-term pay upped the figure to more than $2.02 million, up 14% over a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The advances far exceeded the 1988 average inflation rate of 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
In the magazine's own analysis of how the CEO's performed considering the money 
they make, Business Week gave the best rating to Holly Farms Corp.'s R. Lee 
Taylor II, whom it said "gets paid chicken feed by today's standards." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor made a total of $816,000 over the past three years for running a company 
with $1.8 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>

been selected as the publisher of the U.S. edition of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of the veteran newspaper executive to become the 12th publisher

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: REDEFINING 'DRESSING FOR SUCCESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kathy Taggares sold virtually everything she owned to raise enough cash to buy 
a wholesale food business. Looking back, she says it sometimes takes more guts 
than money to pull off an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years ago, she approached the giant Marriott Corp. with an offer to 
buy Bob's Kitchens, the Marriott subsidiary that was making salad dressings for 
Bob's Big Boy restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure Marriott knew how minimal my resources were and I wasn't about to 
tell them," recalled Taggares. "But I figured, they can throw me out. What else 
could they do?" 
</P>
<P>
Instead of throwing her out, Marriott agreed to sell her the company, accepting 
a combination of cash, a collateralized loan and the payment of the balance 
through future product royalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically bought a $6-million company with $200,000 in cash," said Taggares, 
who sold her life insurance policy, her condominium and all her jewelry to 
raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
Taggares, 36, has worked in the food-processing industry most of her adult 
life. Two years ago, she decided she was ready to own her own company. She 
started asking everyone she knew in the food business for leads and found 
herself looking at companies ranging from a trout farm to a peanut factory. 
</P>
<P>
Through a business broker, she learned that Marriott was planning to get out of 
the food-processing business by selling Bob's Kitchens. In June, 1987, she 
bought the Glendale-based company and changed the name to K. T.'s Kitchens -- 
using her initials. K. T.'s, which has the exclusive right to make all the 
Bob's Big Boy salad dressings for the Marriott-owned Big Boy restaurants, also 
sells the dressings to other restaurants and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott, which has 223 Bob's restaurants primarily on the East and West 
Coasts, is in the process of converting them to Allie's, a more trendy, 
family-style restaurant, according to a Marriott spokesman. He said he could 
not comment on the sale of Bob's Kitchens or the arrangement under which 
Taggares provides salad dressings for the restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Taggares said she is not worried about the loss of the familiar Big Boy 
restaurants because her marketing research has shown that the people who eat at 
Bob's restaurants are not the same ones who buy Bob's salad dressings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our primary user grew up with Bob's and now they don't necessarily 
frequent the restaurants, but they have this wonderful memory of dipping their 
French fries in Bob's bleu cheese dressing," said Taggares. 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of the dressing she makes is sold to Bob's and other restaurant 
chains and food service outlets. The remaining 80% is sold at the retail level 
and available in virtually every supermarket, big and small, in Southern 
California. Taggares said she is not sure whether the Allie's restaurants will 
be buying her dressings in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The dressing is sold under the Big Boy label in stores and sold to restaurants 
and others under the Chef's Award brand. Retailing for about $2.49 for a 
16-ounce jar, Bob's dressing is aimed at the high end of the salad dressing 
market. It is costly, she said, because it contains only natural ingredients 
and features imported cheeses from France. 
</P>
<P>
Most days, K. T.'s Kitchens manufactures 10,000 gallons of Bob's salad 
dressings, filling 150 jars a minute on a modern conveyor belt system. The 
company, which employs about 60, is divided into two parts: One side of the 
factory makes the salad dressings, the other makes refrigerated pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
Using the first year's profits from her salad dressing business, Taggares 
purchased a Monterey Park pizza crust company and moved it into her factory. To 
maximize her investment, she decided to make the entire pizza and not just the 
crust. The pizza is packed under the Poni and K. T.'s brands. 
</P>
<P>
Taggares, whose lean frame belies a diet consisting mainly of corn chips dipped 
in Bob's ranch dressing and her own pizza, said the pizza business is growing 
much faster than the salad dressing business. This year, salad dressing sales 
will be about $10 million and pizza sales about $4 million. Last year, K. T.'s 
posted $8 million in total sales. 
</P>
<P>
When she bought Bob's Kitchens, Taggares said she faced a major obstacle. The 
primarily male, Latino workers had a difficult time adjusting to two new female 
bosses after being supervised by white male, middle managers from Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
There are no middle-level managers at K. T.'s. The company is run by Taggares 
and her general manager, Joan Paris, a longtime friend and colleague who has 
worked with Taggares at various food companies for the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
The two women said they finally won their employees' respect by proving that 
they really knew everything about the food-processing business. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done every single one of these jobs," said Taggares, who frequently fills 
in on the production line when her workers are absent. 
</P>
<P>
Taggares, who grew up in the tiny, potato-growing town of Othello, Wash., has 
sold potatoes and french fries and worked as the general manager of a 
food-processing company. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, she studied dance in New York and still looks and dresses like 
a dancer. After working for several large food companies, she was anxious to 
own her own business and live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I like being the boss, and I thrive on chaos and commotion," said Taggares, 
who usually works 10 to 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
She said her greatest frustration is dealing with the constant mechanical and 
refrigerator breakdowns that plague any food-processing factory. The breakdowns 
add to the pressure of meeting tight deadlines because she makes everything to 
order for customers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the daily aggravations, Taggares said she is looking for new products 
and acquisitions, with an eye toward items sold in the refrigerated section of 
the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"I make a lot of cold calls to business owners," said Taggares. "Some are 
terribly flattered and others think we are trying to buy one of their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Providing insight and tools for the small business owner is the goal of a 
half-day seminar sponsored by the California World Trade Commission's Export 
Finance Office and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. The session, scheduled 
next Tuesday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., features three speakers: L. Fargo 
Wells, director of the California Export Finance Office; Benjamin Pelter, 
author of "How to Prepare a Solid Business Plan," and Edmond Freiermuth, a 
business consultant specializing in helping troubled companies. 
</P>
<P>
The session costs $40 and includes copies of Freiermuth's books. It will be 
held at the Chamber of Commerce, 404 S. Bixel St., Los Angeles. For 
reservations, send checks to Pelter &amp; Associates, 8500 Wilshire Blvd., 
Suite 815, Beverly Hills, Ca. 90211. 
</P>
<P>
Registered investment adviser Libby Agran will discuss "Everything You Wanted 
to Know About Money But Were Afraid to Ask," at a National Assn. of Women 
Business Owners seminar on Tuesday. The dinner meeting begins with cocktails at 
6 p.m. at the Petroleum Club in the Los Angeles Hilton, 930 Wilshire Blvd., Los 
Angeles. The cost is $25 for pre-registered association members, $27 for 
pre-registered non-members and $30 at the door. For information call: (213) 
623-9977. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Herbert G. Kawahara, who as president of the Pacific Stock Exchange was 
responsible for running its day-to-day operations, will resign that post 
effective June 1. 
</P>
<P>
Kawahara, 60, a 32-year veteran of the securities business who assumed the 
presidency in January, 1988, said his resignation will allow him "to devote 
more time to a broader range of personal and professional interests." 
</P>
<P>
Exchange Chief Executive Maurice Mann said Kawahara as president had "made an 
important contribution to the exchange's marketing program and was instrumental 
in initiating the development of a long-range marketing plan." 
</P>
<P>
Since the resignation came as a surprise, no successor has been named, exchange 
spokesman Dale Carlson said. The Pacific Stock Exchange has equity trading 
floors in Los Angeles and San Francisco and options trading in San Francisco.

Nynex Corp.: The New York-based telecommunications company reported 
first-quarter profit of $283.6 million, down 9% from a year ago. Revenue 
totaled $3.2 billion, up 3%. The firm said the results include a $10-million 
charge for its thwarted bid to acquire an interest in a transatlantic 
fiber-optic cable. Higher revenue was attributed to increased activity of the 
firm's non-regulated businesses.

NEXT NORTHROP CEO; 
</P>
<P>
KRESA CHOICE SURPRISES FEW, PLEASES MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kent Kresa, the man who will be giving orders as Northrop Corp.'s new chief 
executive, is said to have risen through the ranks because he has excelled at 
building jet products, a talent that should serve him well as the company's 
emphasis shifts to the factory floor. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas V. Jones, outgoing chief executive at Northrop, said Kresa has been 
tapped for the firm's top spot partly because he has the experience and 
engineering know-how to ensure that the company develops quality fighter planes 
and other equipment for the Pentagon and other customers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the right guy by attitude," Jones said, "and now that he's been through 
management, he knows how to get the people who can do the (production) job 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Kresa, 51, Northrop president and chief operating officer since 1987, will 
succeed Jones sometime late this year. Jones will continue to serve as chairman 
of the company. The selection of Kresa is not surprising, say industry 
analysts, because Northrop is moving from a period of heavy research and 
development into a heavy production period. 
</P>
<P>
With projects such as the B-2 stealth bomber on line, Northrop is expected to 
get 70% to 80% of its sales from production of actual jet equipment over the 
next three to four years. Currently, research and development accounts for 
about 60% of the company's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Known as Creative 
</P>
<P>
"His considerable understanding of technology . . . may be one reason they 
(Northrop) moved now and selected him," said Paul H. Nisbet, aerospace analyst 
at Prudential-Bache Securities. "The B-2 bomber is ready to move into 
full-scale production, and he (Kresa) has concentrated on production. He's more 
internally focused on production than Tom Jones." 
</P>
<P>
Nisbet said Kresa, who joined Northrop as a vice president and manager of the 
Northrop Research and Technology Center in 1975, is also known as a creative 
manager -- one good at getting departments to research and develop prototypes. 
Kresa's skills as a production manager and development specialist "put him on a 
fast track," Nisbet said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Beltramo, a management consultant in the aerospace industry, also said 
it has been clear for some time that Kresa was being groomed for high places at 
Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've heard is that he's a stickler for performance but also that he's a 
reasonable guy," Beltramo said. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his priorities at a Thursday press conference, Kresa sounded the 
same theme. 
</P>
<P>
"My principal priorities are performance, performance, performance," he said. 
"The Air Force is depending on us and we have to deliver. . . . I see Northrop 
as a company with a tremendous responsibility because of the confidence our 
customers have in us. We have to continue to earn that confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Kresa, who was also corporate vice president and general manager of Northrop's 
Ventura division -- which develops and produces unmanned aerial targets and 
remote-piloted vehicles -- cited his varied experience as a factor in his 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions about the company's legal problems -- the government on 
April 11 filed criminal charges against the company's Precision Products 
division and two current employees -- Kresa said they don't reflect any 
fundamental problems at the company. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are problems, we investigate and fix them -- and fix them right 
away," he said. "This is an ethical company, and we believe we are doing things 
right."

GLENFED'S 3RD-QUARTER PROFITS DOWN SHARPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glenfed Inc., parent of Glendale Federal, announced Thursday that third-quarter 
earnings were off sharply due partly to rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
For the quarter ended March 31, the firm reported net income of $20.2 million, 
down from $45.6 million in 1988. The 1988 quarterly earnings included an 
extraordinary item of $9.9 million for utilization of tax loss carry-forwards. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Coulson, president and chief executive of Glenfed, said: "Our earnings 
were impacted by a narrowing of our interest rate spread, a phenomenon 
affecting the majority of the thrift industry . . . Yields on our 
adjustable-rate mortgage portfolio increased and operating expenses declined, 
but these improvements were more than offset by rapidly rising short-term 
interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
Coulson also said that deposit flows, which had been negative in January and 
February, rebounded strongly in March. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan.

"With this one agreement, the company that inaugurated radio broadcasting in 
America in 1920 will dramatically increase its base of operations, which will 
insure that Westinghouse will remain the first name in radio on into the next 
century," said Westinghouse's Group W Radio Chairman Richard H. Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the agreement were not announced, but the Dow Jones News Service 
reported that the deal was "believed to be worth between $350 million and $375 
million." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not in San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
The 10 Metropolitan-Legacy radio stations include FM stations in Los Angeles 
(KTWV), New York (WNEW), Philadelphia (WMMR) and Detroit (WLLZ), and AM-FM 
stations in Washington (WCPT-AM/WCXR-FM), Houston (KILT-AM/FM) and Minneapolis 
(KDWB-AM/FM). 
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse Broadcasting, a unit of Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric 
Corp., already owns 14 radio stations across the country, including all-news 
KFWB-AM in Los Angeles and WINS-AM in New York, adult contemporary KQZY-FM in 
Dallas/Ft. Worth and easy listening KJQY-FM in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Adding the Washington and Detroit markets to its operations would provide Group 
W with stations in nine of the nation's top 10 markets, excluding only San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it said its coverage of the United States would increase to about 
35% from 29%. 
</P>
<P>
Closing of the deal is subject to various conditions, including repayment of 
all public and private debt of Legacy and Metropolitan at a price not to exceed 
$135 million and approval by both companies' boards as well as the Federal 
Communications Commission.

The Soviet Union has canceled plans to construct two more reactors at the 
stricken Chernobyl nuclear power station and has halted expansion of all 
similar plants for safety reasons, the Tass news agency said. The decision was 
announced six days before the third anniversary of the accident at Chernobyl, 
60 miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine, that killed 31 people in the world's 
worst civilian nuclear disaster. Plans to construct two additional reactors at 
the facility had been suspended since the explosion of the No. 4 reactor spread 
a cloud of radiation over Eastern Europe on April 26, 1986. The No. 4 reactor 
is now sealed in concrete. The additions of No. 5 and No. 6 reactors would have 
made Chernobyl the biggest atomic energy station in the world.

James B. Wyngaarden, who has been director of the National Institutes of Health 
since 1982, called an unusual meeting of institute directors and senior 
officials to tell them that he will resign at the beginning of July, the 
Washington Post reported. The NIH, the world's largest biomedical research 
establishment, will dispense more than $6.7 billion in funds during the 1990 
fiscal year. The departure of Wyngaarden, 64, has been rumored for months. 
Wyngaarden came to the NIH from Duke University Medical School, where he was 
chairman of the department of medicine.

Dozens of people in Soviet Georgia were missing and feared dead after a small 
village was flooded when a landslide caused a river to overflow its banks, the 
official Tass news agency reported. The Tass report, filed by its reporter in 
the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, said that an enormous wall of earth crashed 
down on the Charukh River and formed a natural dam about 325 feet high and 
2,000 feet across, causing a deluge that submerged four houses with about 30 
people inside. Only five people were pulled alive from the water and one died a 
short time later, it said. Two bodies were recovered. A local bus believed to 
be carrying more than 20 passengers also was swept away, and a search for 
survivors produced no results, Tass said.

The United States said Panama has sharply curbed visits by Americans in order 
to obstruct monitoring of the May 7 presidential election. State Department 
spokesman Richard Boucher said the move by the regime of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega 
"is an effort to insulate Panama's electoral process from any credible degree 
of public scrutiny." The department also said that Panama is printing false 
voter lists, changing data in voting registries, providing insufficient ballots 
for opposition candidates and using military personnel to campaign illegally.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who has encouraged efforts 
to evict drug dealers and users from public housing, said that officials will 
have to consider the role parents played in drug activity by their children 
before evicting families. Kemp said that in some cases parents may be unable to 
control older children who are engaged in drug activity. But, Kemp said at a 
seminar sponsored by Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) for Colorado constituents, 
there are cases where heads of families are participants in drug enterprises, 
sometimes with their children. Kemp has offered to drop HUD requirements that 
public housing agencies hold hearings for tenants before they can be evicted 
for drug-related activity if local laws provide them with due process.

a shopping mall in Stockton, police said. The six-store complex was closed for 
several hours while authorities investigated the crash. Witnesses reported that 
the two-seat Robinson R-22, owned by Sunrise Helicopters, had taken off from 
Stockton Metro Airport, lost power and looped into a power line before 
crashing, Police Capt. Dennis Perry said. Identification of the victims was

HOWARD ROSENBERG: COMPELLING PORTRAIT OF WIESENTHAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Docudrama: the good, the bad and the used, as television continues to be a 
history teacher with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, for example, HBO presents a movie about famed Nazi hunter 
Simon Wiesenthal that's highly worthy if somewhat lost in TV's blur of 
Holocaust stories. Meanwhile, the accuracy of NBC's recent account of the hunt 
for the infamous Hillside Stranglers has been bitterly attacked. And PBS is 
celebrating the 200th anniversary of America's presidency by airing the 
undistinguished miniseries "George Washington: The Forging of a Nation." 
</P>
<P>
A CBS rerun. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesenthal-like characters surface in drama from time to time, and his 
relentless shadowing of war criminals has inspired many a dramatist. But HBO's 
story, airing at 8 p.m., is the first film biography of Wiesenthal himself, an 
unremarkable-appearing man who has done remarkable things. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his memoirs, "Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story" is a 
well-made, vividly executed movie enhanced by Ben Kingsley's quietly strong 
performance as the Holocaust survivor who emerged from Mauthausen, weak and 
barely able to walk, to become perhaps the most celebrated international 
detective of his time. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Brian Gibson, "Murderers Among Us" explores the German mind as it 
explores German-made horrors, examining the ambiguities and paradoxes of Nazi 
behavior with unusual insight. There is one especially intense moment, for 
example, when a dying SS man begs Wiesenthal the prisoner to forgive him on 
behalf of all Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Writers Abby Mann, Robin Vote and Ron Hutchinson recall Wiesenthal's dogged 
Nazi hunts here, intercutting flashbacks with the present. Looming above all 
else is the specter of the evil Adolf Eichmann, whose 1960 capture in Buenos 
Aires by Israelis is largely credited to information supplied them by 
Wiesenthal. (However, some now maintain that Wiesenthal had less to do with the 
seizure than he has claimed.) 
</P>
<P>
Wiesenthal's experience is always relevant, but especially now in light of 
recently resurging pro-Hitler feeling in Bavaria and reports of increased 
neo-Nazi activity in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is something about HBO's story that falls short. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Wiesenthal's history, like the Holocaust itself, is almost too 
profound to be captured on the screen, even in this three-hour form. No matter 
the intent, a minimized impact is almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the problem is also one of desensitization. There have been so many 
Holocaust stories on TV in recent years that the sheer weight of the whole 
tends to diminish the individual components. By and large, the good along with 
the bad, they all begin looking alike. 
</P>
<P>
At least "Murderers Among Us" attempts to be factual. Not so, apparently, with 
a TV story about atrocities much closer to home. These were the serial slayings 
of 10 Los Angeles women and two in Bellingham, Wash., in the late 1970s, and 
the murderers among us then were Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi, who are now 
serving prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Case of the Hillside Stranglers" aired April 2, anger about the 
movie lingers. 
</P>
<P>
Written and directed by Steven Gethers and based on a controversial book by 
Darcy O'Brien, "The Case of the Hillside Stranglers" was essentially one man's 
story, seeming to grossly exaggerate the role that then Los Angeles homicide 
detective Bob Grogan had in the investigation. Actually, Grogan was merely one 
member of the task force formed to investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan's former wife has attacked the movie as being riddled with untruths, and 
so have others who were intimately acquainted with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a class-B movie and it wasn't accurate," said Sgt. Frank Salerno 
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who was a member of the task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
"It was total bull," said another task force member, Bill Williams, a retired 
homicide detective of the Los Angeles Police Department. "My phone rang all day 
the next day from people who said, 'I thought you worked on that case.' " 
Viewers wouldn't have known it from the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the (state) attorney general's office were the real heroes," 
Williams added. "It sure wasn't Grogan or the LAPD. We overlooked some things 
that could have saved those girls in Bellingham." 
</P>
<P>
"We drew a great deal from the book," responded executive producer Mike 
Rosenfeld. "We did not have ample time. We would have liked three or four hours 
to do an in-depth approach to the subject. In an hour and 35 minutes (actual 
running time), every time you mention one name or open another area, you have 
to close it. We elected to try to tell as much of the story as we could through 
Grogan's point of view. There were other people involved, but we just didn't 
have time to explore them, and I'm sorry we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps angriest of all is veteran Los Angeles Police vice detective Fred 
Clapp, who claims the NBC movie unfairly smeared the reputations of him and his 
former partner by distorting an incident involving them. He said the NBC 
version was drawn from O'Brien's book. 
</P>
<P>
Clapp said he called O'Brien to object after the book was published and has now 
written to NBC, Gethers and O'Brien demanding a retraction and public apology. 
Clapp said that NBC's legal department has responded, referring him to Fries 
Entertainment, one of the movie's producers. 
</P>
<P>
The movie showed Grogan's future girlfriend, J. D. Jackson, being pulled over 
in her car by two men the same way that some of the victims were shown being 
stopped by Buono and Bianchi. The pair who stopped Jackson were later revealed 
in the movie to be not the stranglers, but vice officers who "got drunk after 
duty and were looking for a little action." When confronted by Grogan, they 
shrugged guiltily like little kids caught stealing from the cookie jar. 
</P>
<P>
Although not named in the movie, the vice cops were Clapp and his partner, Mike 
Thompson, now a lieutenant in the narcotics division. 
</P>
<P>
Clapp said he and Thompson had not been drinking or looking for "action." What 
really happened, he said, was that the two officers stopped Jackson for 
speeding, after which they suspected her of being under the influence of 
alcohol, although they ultimately let her go after failing to get a squad car 
to pick her up. Clapp said that Jackson later told the police that she may have 
encountered the serial slayers, but that he and Thompson were investigated and 
cleared of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't identify the cops," Rosenfeld said. "We were simply drawing on an 
actual incident that took place. We didn't make a big deal of it; we tried to 
minimize it. And if anybody was hurt by that, I'm sorry about that." 
</P>
<P>
So what's the harm if the movie didn't identify them? "The two vice cops 
depicted in that film could not have been anyone else but us," Clapp said. 
"Everybody knows it -- my friends, everyone." 
</P>
<P>
From the forging of police reputations to the forging of the United States, 
meanwhile, it's a long trip back into history. 
</P>
<P>
Showing the deflated state of public television, PBS is making its own history 
by using a 1986 CBS miniseries to note "the 200th anniversary of the 
presidency." This is surely the first time public TV has rerun a commercial 
network entertainment program that wasn't part of a wider retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
The second and concluding part of "George Washington: The Forging of a Nation" 
airs at 9 tonight on Channels 28, 15 and 24. It's a sequel to the 1984 CBS 
miniseries "George Washington." Both productions were based on -- but didn't 
live up to -- James Thomas Flexner's acclaimed biography of Washington, who is 
played here by Barry Bostwick. 
</P>
<P>
Although accompanied by an interview of Flexner by Bill Moyers, "The Forging of 
a Nation" is historically shallow melodrama. It's inoffensive entertainment, 
but hardly the high-level alternative programming expected of PBS.

SACRIFICES ON A 'FIELD OF DREAMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Field of Dreams" (citywide) is a movie about crazy dreams and impossible 
reunions, and it presents baseball as a kind of national sacrament, the 
instrument of near-holy reconciliation between the generations. The film is set 
in an Iowa cornfield, where an obsessed young farmer has built a baseball 
diamond because he heard voices promising him, "If you build it, he will come." 
Who? When? Is the movie a Christ fable, a sports comedy, or both? 
</P>
<P>
Director-writer Phil Alden Robinson certainly has his heart in the right place. 
He wants to make a film about loving your parents, chasing your wildest hopes, 
finding and accepting your past. He wants to heal all the wounds of the 
post-'60s, salve and soothe and bind them up. And he doesn't do any of this in 
a cheap or sensationalized way. "Field of Dreams" is about as heartfelt a movie 
as any major studio has given us recently. 
</P>
<P>
But there's something missing, something tentative and uncertain. In order to 
pull off a magic trick, you often have to distract the audience with smooth 
patter, clever detail or indirection. And this movie tries to play it so pure 
and unabashed that we can see right up its sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, adapted from the W.P. Kinsella novel "Shoeless Joe," Robinson 
tries to create a symbolic fable about the children of the '60s finding their 
way back to their more conservative parents via the common ground of baseball. 
The farmer, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), came to Iowa via New York City and 
college years in Berkeley; an ex-campus radical who parted with his elderly dad 
on bad terms. Costner plays Ray with the stolid no-nonsense stance of a casual 
jock and eyes that always seem to be inviting you into a shared joke. 
</P>
<P>
It's the right contrast, because everything that Ray does seems crazy. After 
the voice beckons him from the corn, he blows all his family's money on the 
diamond, setting himself up for a foreclosure, sitting there in the long, empty 
Iowa afternoons apparently staring at nothing, waiting for the ineffable. His 
wife Annie (Amy Madigan), with a saint's patience, stands behind him. Finally 
the mists and the cornstalks part, and a Christlike figure appears: Shoeless 
Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), baseball's ultimate outsider-hero, and the central 
figure in John Sayles' "Eight Men Out" and, a few years ago, "The Natural," 
where he's the inspiration for Robert Redford's Roy Hobbes. 
</P>
<P>
Like a prophet, speaking in the crepuscular Midwestern light, Shoeless Joe 
greets his deliverer, and the voice proceeds to send Ray off again after a 
missing writer: who, in the novel, was J.D. Salinger, the catcher in the rye 
following the outfielder into the corn. But Robinson abandons the Salinger 
reference and turns recluse-writer Terrence Mann (James Earl Jones) into a 
bizarre Pulitzer-Prize winning novelist and black ex-activist who abandoned 
fiction for poetry about whales and devising computer software programs for 
children. Jones, amazingly, brings off this absurd role, cowing us with his 
majestic presence, his wonderfully baleful glare and wry delivery. Burt 
Lancaster, who can be equally majestic, brings off another peculiar role 
equally well, a mixture of Norman Rockwell, Jean Hersholt and "The Twilight 
Zone." 
</P>
<P>
The movie invites us into what seems a cracked idee fixe, then suggests that 
the core of the obsession is perfectly true: a mystical gig. The Iowa locations 
are lit by cinematographer John Lindley ("True Believer," "The Stepfather") as 
a flat but radiant heartland, and at one point Ray makes a joking connection 
between "Iowa" and "heaven." 
</P>
<P>
All of this would work better if Robinson built up the reality of the town 
more, made the citizens a more palpable presence, as Frank Capra did in 
Hollywood's greatest fable-fantasy, "It's a Wonderful Life." You begin to 
wonder why the Kinsellas get so few non-celestial visitors, why no one in the 
area asks Ray if they can use his baseball diamond for a game or two. The 
family seems weirdly isolated, and when they attend a PTA meeting and Annie 
wins over a book-banning audience by arguing that censorship smacks of 
Stalinism, the crowd caves in en masse. It's like a version of "Harvey" where 
we see James Stewart and the rabbit, but not the wondering or dyspeptic people 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
But should baseball be presented as a sacrament? Some cold, stylized, 
supernatural rite where the greats of the past move in stately rhythms across a 
perfect, barren field with hardly any spectators? Where are the hot dogs, the 
sweat, the beer, the savage imprecations against the umpire's sight and sanity, 
the wild frenzy when the tying run reaches third? Robinson trying to use 
baseball as a metaphor for America's common ground ends up diminishing, in a 
way, what makes it a common ground: the fact that it's a game full of sunlit 
frenzy and excitement. He gets the legend of excellence but not the thrill of 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tossup. "Field of Dreams," (MPAA rated PG), like any wild fantasy, will 
work if you want it to work, inspire belief if you believe it. The director and 
actors -- especially Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster -- are 
obviously giving it their all. The movie tries to dispel cynicism or doubts, by 
ignoring the world around it, serving up its magic pure and raw. And, if you 
want it, it will come.

<P>
Wayne Gretzky, stripped of his famous No. 99 jersey and down to his sweaty blue 
T-shirt and suspenders, was being held hostage by the Calgary Flames' Jim 
Peplinski, who was trying mightily to keep Gretzky's head locked between 
himself and the big guy who was charging to Gretzky's rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's buddy, Marty McSorley, wanted to step in, but he couldn't for the 
longest time pry Gretzky loose from Peplinski's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Once Gretzky was set free, McSorley and Peplinski squared off for some serious 
fisticuffs, while Calgary's Jamie Macoun took over the task of tying up 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls, who long before had punched the Flames' goalie and even scored 
a couple of goals in the Kings' weak effort, was watching all this from the 
bench. "If I were Peplinski, I'd be embarrassed," Nicholls said. "The guy is 
6-4 and he's hiding behind Wayne? That's embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone on the ice had, in turn, something to be embarrassed about. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings weren't exactly boasting about the way they let things get out of 
hand early and lost Game 2 of their best-of-seven Smythe Division final playoff 
series, 8-3, to the Calgary Flames Thursday night at the Saddledome, falling 
behind two games to none. 
</P>
<P>
Although they'll never admit it, the officials might be a little embarrassed, 
too, when they look at the tapes and try to explain some of their decisions. 
Such as why they decided to allow the Flames' fourth goal, scored while their 
goalie, Mike Vernon, was lying in the crease at the other end with his trainer 
kneeling over him. 
</P>
<P>
Or later, why McSorley got a game misconduct in addition to five minutes for 
fighting in the melee that involved everyone on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Dave Taylor of the Kings stayed out on the ice when the game was 
finally and mercifully over to ask about that. Taylor was told that McSorley 
got the game misconduct for being the aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was Jay Miller who started the final all-out brawl with a 
crosscheck. But somebody had to start it. It was one of those games that was 
out of hand early and had tempers very short. 
</P>
<P>
In the final tally, the penalties and penalty minutes were not as one-sided as 
the goals and shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames dominated the real game, taking 52 shots (a playoff record for 
Calgary) to get their eight goals. The Kings took just 23 shots. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings had the edge with 21 penalties and 73 penalty minutes to 18 
penalties and 56 penalty minutes for the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those came in that final fight. 
</P>
<P>
The sellout crowd of 20,062 seemed to think that the winner of the fight was 
Flame wing Lanny McDonald. He earned ovations and chants for his scoring 
punches on the Kings' Jim Wiemer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Miller and Joel Otto were fighting to a draw. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, the aggressor was McSorley? 
</P>
<P>
It all ended with Calgary police officers standing between the fans and the 
Kings' bench to keep the brawl from erupting anew. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity in penalties left the Kings with a seven-minute penalty to kill 
(with Miller in the box for crosschecking and fighting) over the last 7 minutes 
15 seconds of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it mattered much. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames went ahead, 4-0, at 11:35 of the first period while the Flames' 
trainer, Jim (Bearcat) Murray, was on the ice, tending to Vernon, who had been 
tagged with a right by Nicholls that sent him into the left post. Al MacInnis, 
oblivious to the first-aid taking place at the other end, took a pass from 
Hakan Loob right in front of the Kings' goal and beat goalie Kelly Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, usually one of the most unflappable players on the ice, flew into a 
frenzy of disbelief, following the officials all around the rink, demanding to 
know how they could let the goal stand. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nicholls was back, sitting on the Kings' bench. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls never made his way to the penalty box for the roundhouse right. 
Apparently, the officials were planning only a two-minute roughing penalty, and 
that was negated by the score. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't explain to Gretzky why the goal should count while there were 
extra people on the ice, whether those people had skates on or not. 
</P>
<P>
And for the rest of the game the question hung over the ice? Who would be 
designated to pay back Nicholls for the outrage, and when would it happen? When 
the later melee occurred, Nicholls was on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Nicholls swung on Vernon there had already been a couple of 
nose-to-nose jostlings, but after the punch, tempers were much shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Kings were fighting the frustration and humiliation of giving up 
three goals in the first six minutes. And on just five shots. 
</P>
<P>
A new starting lineup that put Chris Kontos and Mike Allison out with Gretzky 
gave up the first goal to Colin Patterson just 58 seconds into the game. A shot 
off the left post went wide, with both Patterson and Kontos racing for it. 
Patterson won. 
</P>
<P>
Flame center Doug Gilmour, star of Game 1 when he scored the winner in 
overtime, got the first of his consecutive goals, flying at Hrudey in a 
three-on-two situation and taking a pass from MacDonald, right in front of the 
goal, at 4:48. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour made it 3-0 just 1 minute 12 seconds later when King defenseman Dean 
Kennedy swung and missed on a puck in the Kings' zone, Joey Mullen scooped it 
up before Wiemer could get to it, and Mullen gave it off to Gilmour for the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the much-debated fourth goal, and after that, things got wild. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls scored the first of his two goals at 13:59, but it was more of the 
same in the second period, with the Flames going ahead, 5-1, with a long 
slapshot through traffic by Rob Ramage on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames went up, 6-1, on the most embarrassing goal of the night when Loob 
beat Hrudey and scored short-handed on a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls scored at 19:59 of the second period on a pass from Gretzky, and the 
Kings made it 6-3 when Taylor got a goal at 7:49 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
But the margin went right back to four goals when Mullen took a pass from 
Patterson and beat Glenn Healy, who had replaced Hrudey at the start of the 
final period and gave up the last two goals. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Roberts scored the final goal two minutes later for Calgary, and it was 
all over except the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have lost nine straight games at Calgary. When that was mentioned, 
King goalie Kelly Hrudey said: "I'm glad you brought that up. It's just like 
the streak the (Edmonton) Oilers had. It just means that time is on our side." 
. . . Chris Kontos, who had scored in five straight playoff games, had his 
streak ended. . . . The Kings will have home ice for the next two games, 
Saturday night at 7:30 and Monday night at 7:30. Both games are sold out. . . . 
Defenseman Doug Crossman played for the Kings in just his second game of the 
playoff season. Dale DeGray, who had an assist in Game 1 against the Flames, 
was scratched.

ENGLAND'S SOCCER TRAGEDY: THE DAY THE FRONT ROW BECAME DEATH ROW

LIVERPOOL, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the one-liners for which Bill Shankly, the messiah of Liverpool soccer, 
was renowned, perhaps the best remembered is his version of an old sports 
witticism: "Football isn't a matter of life and death. It's more important than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Shankly died in 1981, after building the Liverpool Football Club from a minor 
league also-ran into a powerhouse of the British and European game. But his 
name is now back on thousands of Liverpool lips as residents of this 
grief-stricken and much-maligned city are forced for the second time in less 
than four years to wonder if the gods are somehow testing them against their 
late hero's yardstick. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five Liverpool supporters, most of them residents of this faded, central 
England port city, were asphyxiated or crushed to death at a semifinal national 
championship match at Hillsborough Stadium in nearby Sheffield last weekend 
when surging crowds trampled or trapped them against metal barriers on an 
enclosed and already overcrowded viewing terrace. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst sporting disaster in British history and a shock for the 
nation, but a particularly painful trauma here. 
</P>
<P>
"Our city again has to show its resilience to yet more pain and suffering," 
Rev. Ray Hutchinson told more than 500 mourners in nearby Waterloon Thursday as 
Gary Church, 19, was laid to rest in the first funeral from the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
It's so painful because for at least a generation, most of this city has shared 
Shankly's obsession with the game. It has been one source of pride in a city 
and a life style that have for too long been lacking in other satisfactions. 
</P>
<P>
And even as Liverpool suffers the aftermath of its latest soccer tragedy, it is 
simultaneously demonstrating once more that the game is a powerful glue that 
can unite its residents in a way remarkable for a community its size. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five days, police estimate, more than 300,000 people have filed 
into the city's Anfield football grounds in an extraordinary collective act of 
pilgrimage. That is the equivalent of nearly 75% of Liverpool's population. 
Club officials said their unplanned 10- to 12-hour daily open house will 
continue at least through the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The mourners have filled cash barrels with donations for bereaved relatives and 
covered Anfield's goal posts, perimeter fencing, part of the stands and a 
sizable portion of the playing field with tributes to the dead. 
</P>
<P>
There are scarfs in Liverpool red and white, as well as the colors of competing 
teams; stuffed bears and other mementos; soccer balls; original poems, and 
flowers -- a ton and a half of flowers, according to one volunteer steward. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the tributes have been laid at "the Kop" -- the standing-room-only 
section at the home team's end of the field. The name is taken from a South 
African hill defended by a Liverpool regiment in the Boer War at the turn of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
Anfield has long been known as "the cathedral of English soccer," in cliched 
respect for both the success of the Liverpool club and the passion of its 
supporters. But this week, London Times correspondent Simon Barnes noted, "they 
turned it into a real cathedral, and the goal at the Kop end became a high 
altar." 
</P>
<P>
The second-ranking Anglican clergyman here, Rt. Rev. Michael Henshall, 
commented: "The tributes (at Anfield) said that the dead had 'Gone to be with 
Shank,' not 'Gone to be with Christ.' " 
</P>
<P>
At Gary Church's funeral Thursday, they played the Liverpool club anthem -- 
"You'll Never Walk Alone." 
</P>
<P>
But the message at Anfield that seemed best to capture the mood of Liverpool 
read simply: "Why? Why? Why? Why?" 
</P>
<P>
Liverpool fans were also involved in perhaps the blackest page of soccer's 
recent, violent history. They triggered a riot in 1985 that claimed 38 lives at 
Brussels' Heysel Stadium. Many Continental commentators were quick to link the 
two tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques George, president of the European Football Union, criticized what he 
characterized as the "especially aggressive mentality" of Liverpudlians after 
Saturday's disaster at Hillsborough Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again it's England; once again it's Liverpool; once again it's a 
demonstration of what I would call savagery," the French official said in an 
interview with a Paris radio station. "When you saw the faces of people who 
were in that gangway in Sheffield, they looked like uncaged animals, their eyes 
popping out. It was frightening." 
</P>
<P>
George later apologized for his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian newspaper, Gazzetta Sportiva, saw last weekend's tragedy as 
retribution for Heysel, in which most of the victims were supporters of Turin's 
Juventus club. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing the triumph of stupidity in a country marked by terrible soccer 
violence, but incapable of learning from it," the paper editorialized. "Through 
a sort of tragic revenge, the price has been paid by Liverpool fans." 
</P>
<P>
Even in Britain, the chairman of the South Yorkshire County Police Federation, 
Paul Middup, said Tuesday there was "mass drunkenness" among the Liverpool fans 
whose last-minute surge into Hillsborough was a key contributor to the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Other published reports in the central British press, unconfirmed and 
attributed only to unnamed policemen, charged that Liverpool supporters looted 
bodies of the dead, and kicked, punched, and urinated on officers trying to 
revive the injured. 
</P>
<P>
Although the shame of Brussels still runs deep here, Liverpool's detractors 
"took two separate incidents that had nothing to do with each other and put 
them together," complained Paul Brown, 34, a volunteer Anfield steward. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to live with that, don't we?" added Brian Christopher, 46, another 
volunteer who attended his first Anfield game 37 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Liverpool Echo columnist Joe Holmes earlier this week: 
</P>
<P>
"Politicians, employers, statisticians, economists, national newspaper editors, 
TV program producers, and comedians have all fed on us and have been putting us 
down for years. To all of these we say: Leave Liverpool alone. Let us grieve 
with our families, our neighbors, our friends and work mates. We do not need 
you muscling in on our mourning. To each and every one of those people making 
wild accusations we say: Pipe down. . . . let us pick up the pieces of this 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction here reflects a deep sense of separateness -- and, some say, 
inferiority -- that Liverpudlians feel toward much of the world outside their 
own familiar corner of Britain along the Mersey River. A London journalist 
called this "the only truly foreign city in England." 
</P>
<P>
Liverpool is economically depressed, left well behind in Britain's economic 
turnaround. Merseyside unemployment hovers around 20%. The docks, which once 
employed about 25,000 workers handling a significant percentage of Britain's 
overseas trade, now provide jobs for only about 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The population here plummeted by about one-third in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Henshall characterizes those who are left as "a volatile population in 
search of an identity. And they can't find an identity in the normal channels 
of normal work." 
</P>
<P>
Football fills the void. 
</P>
<P>
"The one success story in the city has been Liverpool Football Club," said 
Chief Executive Peter Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Liverpool and, to a slightly lesser extent, the city's other professional 
soccer team, Everton, "helped it keep its self-respect," said editor Chris 
Oakley of the Liverpool Echo. "It would have been very easy to wallow in 
despair." 
</P>
<P>
Liverpudlians are weaned on football, and the extent to which its teams and the 
life of the community are interwoven is probably unrivaled in American 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Some supporters concede that the fanaticism with which so many identify with 
their team can be frightening. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged taxi driver said he has refused for the last three years to 
attend a game if he has to stand in the Kop or the terraces of some other 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too dangerous," he said. "Years ago, I would have done anything I had to 
to watch Liverpool from any vantage point whatsoever. But I tend to weigh 
things up more carefully now before I jump in." 
</P>
<P>
Liverpudlians concede that there are some people who go to games looking for 
trouble. But they insist that these are a tiny minority. For the rest, what 
often looks to opponents and outsiders like dangerous fanaticism among 
Liverpool supporters is an acceptable, if not laudable, norm. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting pushed and jostled is part of the atmosphere," said student Steven 
Collins, 19, with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Garrett, co-founder of the Football Supporters Assn., compares the rowdy 
behavior and bawdy chants of the typical crowd to a war dance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tribal syndrome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Rev. Henshall, who worries that local football fans have gone "over the 
top" in their enthusiasm, added quickly that the game nevertheless provides 
"the most enormous safety valve" for a society that has few other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, last weekend's Hillsborough disaster seems destined only to 
reinforce the game as what Henshall called a folk religion. 
</P>
<P>
A number of families have already asked for permission to scatter the ashes of 
loved ones killed at the Anfield ground. 
</P>
<P>
A club official responded: "There is no doubt that if this is what the families 
wish, this is what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't be the first time. Bill Shankly's ashes were also sprinkled over 
Anfield.

SHUG MCGAUGHEY, TRAINER OF WOOD AND KENTUCKY DERBY FAVORITE, SMILES A LOT

<P>
Shug McGaughey was in a surprisingly good mood at his Belmont Park barn 
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sure, McGaughey should be chipper, since he trains Easy Goer, the heavy 
favorite in Saturday's $500,000 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and the odds-on 
favorite for the Kentucky Derby, which will be run at Churchill Downs May 6. 
</P>
<P>
But a trainer is never devoid of worries, and even a trainer with a horse as 
fast as Easy Goer can frown some. Cases in point, as far as McGaughey is 
concerned: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Jane McGaughey, the trainer's wife and Easy Goer's exercise rider 
until she became too great with child, is scheduled to deliver their second 
baby in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seeking the Gold, a top 3-year-old last year and a horse expected to be one 
of the country's best handicap runners this year, jammed his ankle in Florida 
last month, just about the time he was going to make his 1989 debut. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grand Gala, a talented 3-year-old filly who was being pointed for the 
Kentucky Oaks, the day before the Derby, hurt a knee while running at Keeneland 
recently and underwent arthroscopic surgery for removal of a bone chip Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Easy Goer, in his final workout before the Wood, breezed a half-mile 
Thursday at Belmont in :46 1/5, which was two or three seconds faster than 
McGaughey wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McGaughey was smiling at an early hour in his barn office. The 
opposition in the Wood is so nondescript that McGaughey's colt should be able 
to spot the others an extra-quick workout and still thrash them. The best of 
Easy Goer's five rivals may be Diamond Donnie, and he ran second, 13 lengths 
behind Easy Goer, at Aqueduct two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/8-mile Wood will be only the second time around two turns for Easy Goer 
-- he was second, after a bad start in the mud, in the 1 1/16-mile Breeders' 
Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs last November -- but McGaughey does not believe 
that this will be a factor. Neither does Aqueduct's track handicapper, who has 
made the son of Alydar a 1-9 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, McGaughey chastised David Carroll, Easy Goer's current 
exercise rider, when the trainer thought the colt had worked too fast at 
Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing the best I can but I just can't hold him," Carroll told McGaughey. 
</P>
<P>
So when Easy Goer and Carroll went considerably faster than McGaughey's 
expectations Thursday, the trainer accepted the workout calmly. "He was still 
running well within himself," McGaughey said. "A good horse like this one just 
runs that fast, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
It was a morning that called for Barbra Streisand -- one of those rare New York 
days so clear that you could see forever. Outside the barn after the workout, 
Mary Jane McGaughey, dressed in jeans and a floppy T-shirt that advertised her 
condition, held Easy Goer's lead shank while a groom hosed the horse's ankles 
in a bright spring sunshine that made the colt's butterscotch coat glisten. 
</P>
<P>
A battalion of photographers shot the horse from every angle, as they might a 
model in a swimsuit, and Easy Goer just stood there with his handlers, 
impervious to the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's coat is not as bright as the near-red appearance of Secretariat, 
the 1973 Triple Crown champion with whom McGaughey's horse has been frequently 
compared. But just standing still, Easy Goer is a stunning animal. He has what 
horsemen generically call a star in the middle of his forehead, although the 
white marking could pass for a catawampus triangle. If McGaughey were given a 
Rorschach test with the same pattern, he might say that it resembles a map of 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey mentioned Secretariat. "I know Secretariat got beat in the Wood but 
that's the reason a horse wins and pays $100 sometimes," he said. "But I sure 
don't expect this horse to lose Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he expect Easy Goer to lose at Churchill Downs two weeks from now. 
Easy Goer has run eight times, losing twice, and one of the defeats was at the 
Louisville track, but he still was a fast-closing second to Is It True that day 
and McGaughey has dismissed the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's other defeat was in the first race of his career, going six 
furlongs at Belmont last August, when he also broke slowly and came from behind 
but lost by a nose to a 2-year-old who wasn't even nominated for this year's 
Triple Crown races. Is It True was injured in his Breeders' Cup win over Easy 
Goer and only recently returned to the races. 
</P>
<P>
In his second start, Easy Goer was a winner at Saratoga -- his first of three 
victories over the same Is It True -- and McGaughey thought there was something 
wrong with the track timer when it showed 1:22 3/5 for seven furlongs. Three 
weeks later, however, when Easy Goer ran a 6 1/2-furlong race back at Belmont 
in a sparkling 1:15 2/5, McGaughey knew that the Saratoga clock didn't need to 
be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Moving into stakes competition, Easy Goer romped in the Cowdin and Champagne at 
Belmont before his 2-year-old season ended with the 1 1/4-length defeat in the 
Breeders' Cup. He still won the Eclipse Award as the year's best 2-year-old 
colt. Easy Goer has won his six races by a total of 36 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey, 38, trains for the Phipps family -- Ogden and his son, Dinny -- and 
he went to Florida with Easy Goer and the rest of their horses for the winter. 
The plan was to race Easy Goer lightly, skipping the Florida Derby and the 
Flamingo, Florida's two major preps for the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer raced on Florida Derby day at Gulfstream, but it was in the 
seven-furlong Swale Stakes, and he won easily, being clocked in 1:22 1/5. Then 
Easy Goer was shipped North and he blew their doors off in the Gotham on April 
8, running the mile in 1:32 2/5, which missed breaking Dr. Fager's 21-year-old 
world record by a fifth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>

MORNING BRIEFING: A CASE OF BITE BEING AS BAD AS BARKLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers, who has shown that he can play and 
talk a good game, was at it again Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a comment at practice implying that he could be handled by 
Milwaukee's Larry Krystowiak, Barkley bulled his way to 34 points -- he made 15 
of 16 shots -- and 12 rebounds in a 124-102 romp over the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who was held to 19 points a game, seven under his season average, in 
three previous games against the Bucks, told the Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call: 
"I don't appreciate it when people say Larry Krystowiak can stop me. 
</P>
<P>
"I find a comment like that to be humorous. Larry is a good player and a good 
friend of mine. He's a nice man. But he can't stop me. No one man on the planet 
can stop me. Maybe not the universe either." 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, he's probably right. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Roger Clemens Thursday became the fourth Boston Red Sox pitcher in 
history to reach the 1,000-strikeout mark. Luis Tiant, with 1,075, and Bruce 
Hurst, with 1,043, are two others. Name the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Padded room: Right fielder Ron Jones of the Philadelphia Phillies made a fine 
catch Tuesday night at New York to deny Dave Magadan of the Mets an extra-base 
hit and save at least two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Jones paid for it by apparently dislocating his right kneecap after crashing 
into the hard wall. Even the New York players were sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they don't make enough money here to pad the outfield walls," one Met 
told Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
Author! Author!: The great run of Orel Hershiser, the Dodger pitcher and Cy 
Young Award winner, continues. 
</P>
<P>
His book, "Out of the Blue," written with Jerry B. Jenkins, will be No. 5 on 
the New York Times' best-seller list next week in the hard-cover nonfiction 
category. Since the first printing of 100,000, the publisher has requested 
another 80,000 copies, and in another month or so the rights to the paperback 
version are expected to be auctioned for at least six figures. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad, considering that Hershiser's book was not published by a major house. 
Hershiser went with Wolgemuth &amp; Hyatt, a Christian publishing company in 
Brentwood, Tenn., after meeting its partners, Robert Wolgemuth and Michael 
Hyatt. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Times: "They hit it off, perhaps because the company publishes 
evangelical books and Mr. Hershiser is a member of the evangelical Lake Avenue 
Congregational Church in Pasadena, Calif." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
Now it can be told: In 1980, Bob Kennedy, then the general manager of the 
Chicago Cubs, called Whitey Herzog, manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, and 
asked if he would be interested in managing the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me they were only two players away from being a contender," Herzog 
said. "I figured it would take more than that. But one reason I didn't want to 
manage the Cubs was they played all day games and I wouldn't be able to go 
fishing in the mornings." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Cy Young, who had 1,341 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Football Coach Mike Price of Washington State, who left Weber State 
after eight seasons to take over the Cougars six weeks ago, asked if there was 
anything not progressing as quickly as he would like this spring: "The sale of 
my house in Ogden (Utah)."

Gregg Jefferies broke a 1-for-28 slump with a game-tying single, and Mookie 
Wilson's grounder scored the go-ahead run in the seventh inning as the New York 
Mets beat Chicago, 4-3, Thursday night, sending the Cubs to their fourth 
straight defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden (3-0) allowed four hits in seven innings to get the victory, and 
Roger McDowell finished for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson gave the Cubs a 3-0 lead with a two-run double in the first inning 
and a run-scoring single in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Met right fielder Darryl Strawberry was forced to leave in the third inning 
because of stiffness in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Montreal 2 -- Rookie Ken Hill earned his first major league 
victory and drove in a run at St. Louis as the Cardinals snapped the Expos' 
four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals broke a 2-2 tie in the fifth inning as Ozzie Smith singled, moved 
to second on an errant pickoff throw and took third on a grounder. Smith came 
home on Pedro Guerrero's sacrifice fly off rookie Randy Johnson (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Houston 4, Atlanta 3 -- Third baseman Ron Gant's fielding error allowed Kevin 
Bass to score the go-ahead run in the eighth inning, and the Astros snapped a 
four-game losing streak by beating the Braves at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros trailed, 3-2, when Glenn Davis started the rally with a walk off Jim 
Acker and took second on a sacrifice by Rafael Ramirez. Bass greeted Paul 
Assenmacher (0-1) with a run-scoring double and went to third on a wild pitch. 
Craig Biggio grounded to third base, but the ball went through Gant's legs. 
</P>
<P>
The victory went to Danny Darwin (1-0), and Dave Smith finished for his second 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 9, Pittsburgh 4 -- Von Hayes hit a two-run homer, and Mike Schmidt 
doubled twice to break the Phillies' club record for career hits as the 
Phillies downed the Pirates at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Dodger Ken Howell (2-0) allowed four runs and three hits in six innings to 
get the victory, before Greg Harris pitched two scoreless innings and Todd 
Frohwirth finished up.

CLIPPERS' CASEY WILL EXPLORE JOB POSSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Casey, having been given no indication of his future as Clipper coach, will 
fly to the East Coast early Sunday morning to interview for the basketball job 
at Rider College in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who has directed a late-season Clipper resurgence that has brought 
praise from his own players and the opposition alike, said Thursday he will 
take a red-eye flight from Sacramento to Philadelphia shortly after the team's 
season finale Saturday night against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with officials at Rider, a Division I school with an 
enrollment of approximately 5,000, Monday. John Carpenter, the college's 
longtime basketball coach, moved up to become athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an interest," Casey said, cautioning that this is not an ultimatum 
directed at Clipper management. "What it comes down to is, do I want to coach 
or do I not want to coach? Right now, the feeling is I want to coach. I'd 
rather coach these kids (the Clippers) than any other kids, but I have to 
consider any offer anyone else has. 
</P>
<P>
"My first priority still would be to be a pro coach. I'm not saying it (the 
Rider job) has been offered and I'm not saying I will take it. It's a normal 
business process." 
</P>
<P>
Casey's roots run deep in the Philadelphia-New Jersey area, and Rider is 
located in Lawrenceville, not far from Princeton. He grew up in Collingswood, 
N.J., and became an assistant and then head coach at Temple. He had lived in 
the area all his life until becoming an assistant with the Chicago Bulls in 
1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper officials remained non-committal about their interim head coach, who 
has compiled a 11-31 record since taking over for Gene Shue Jan. 19, including 
10-10 since March 10. 
</P>
<P>
Although no word on Casey's status with the Clippers is expected soon, the 
Clippers plan to talk with him next week.

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CELTICS ROUTED BY KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a decade of contending for the NBA title, the Boston Celtics are going 
into the final three days of the regular season battling to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not used to scrapping for a playoff spot, but that's the cards we've 
been dealt," Robert Parish said after the New York Knicks routed the Celtics, 
137-117, Thursday night in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Jackson scored 29 points for the Knicks, and Eddie Lee Wilkins, starting 
in place of injured Patrick Ewing, got six during a 13-0 run at the start of 
the second half that broke the game open. 
</P>
<P>
New York extended an eight-point halftime lead to 82-61 in the third quarter as 
Wilkins, averaging under four points a game, got free inside for three layups 
during the 13-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 100, Chicago 98 -- Ledell Eackles scored a career-high 28 points, 
and John Williams added 21, rallying the Bullets to a win at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan led Chicago with 30 points but had only four assists and five 
rebounds, while committing six turnovers. Horace Grant scored 18 points for the 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets used a 10-0 third-quarter run to cut a 65-54 deficit to one point 
with 3:17 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls led, 74-71, after three quarters, but the Bullets outscored them, 
7-0, in the first two minutes of the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 105, New Jersey 92 -- Hersey Hawkins hit his first 10 shots, and 
the 76ers shot 69% at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia took the lead for good with a 13-2 spurt that broke a 13-13 tie in 
the first period. Charles Barkley had five of his 15 points in the run, and 
former Net Mike Gminski added four of his 19. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey drew within three points in the second quarter and was within 65-61 
midway through the third. The 76ers then went on a 9-4 burst to pull away for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 136, San Antonio 113 -- Michael Adams scored 25 points, and the Nuggets 
scored the first 18 points of the fourth quarter at Denver, snapping a 
five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Fat Lever had 23 points and Alex English 22 as the Nuggets won their 19th 
straight home game. 
</P>
<P>
Denver led by as many as 18 points in the first half and held off a 
second-quarter rally by the Spurs that cut the lead to 67-61 shortly before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-point spurt at the start of the fourth quarter gave the Nuggets a 122-92 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 124, Portland 118 -- Dale Ellis and Xavier McDaniel each scored 31 
points as the SuperSonics won at home and kept the Trail Blazers from clinching 
a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Portland made a strong run in the fourth quarter despite the absence of center 
Kevin Duckworth, who missed the game because of strep throat. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Kersey scored 30 points, Kevin Porter 28 and Clyde Drexler 21 for the 
Trail Blazers.

KINGS CAN'T BELIEVE THAT GOAL CALGARY SCORED WITH TRAINER ON ICE STOOD UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CALGARY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the many goals scored Thursday night by the Calgary Flames, none upset the 
Kings more than the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
For those who watched the Kings' 8-3 loss on television, that was the one that 
put the Flames ahead, 4-0, just 11 minutes 35 seconds into the first period and 
prompted a stream of obscenities from Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
What set him off? 
</P>
<P>
He thought the Flames had too many men on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
And he was right. 
</P>
<P>
The trespassing Flame was trainer Jim (Bearcat) Murray, who ran onto the ice 
while the puck was still in play to tend to injured goaltender Mike Vernon, who 
was punched by the Kings' Bernie Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Bill McCreary, his right arm raised to signify a delayed roughing 
penalty against Nicholls, appeared to see Murray run onto the ice but allowed 
play to continue as the Flames moved the puck toward the Kings' goal. 
</P>
<P>
Only seconds later, Al MacInnis took a centering pass from Hakan Loob and fired 
the puck over the left shoulder of King goaltender Kelly Hrudey and into the 
upper right corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames were flying, well on their way to a Game 2 rout that put them ahead, 
2-0, in the best-of-seven Smythe Division final series. 
</P>
<P>
And Gretzky was about to throw a screaming fit. 
</P>
<P>
But according to John McCauley, the National Hockey League's supervisor of 
officials, McCreary handled the play correctly. 
</P>
<P>
NHL rules, McCauley said, do not forbid trainers from running onto the ice 
while play is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
"There are rules covering coaches and managers coming onto the ice after the 
start of the game," said McCauley, who watched the game from the press box, 
"but there's nothing about trainers. 
</P>
<P>
"(The officials) don't have to stop play automatically. Calgary had possession 
of the puck, so (McCreary) waited until possession changed. As it turned out, 
the Flames scored." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said that he assumed the play would be blown dead and he ran out onto 
the ice so quickly because he though Vernon was more seriously injured than he 
turned out to be. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon stayed in the game, and Nicholls' punch, which knocked the goaltender to 
the ice, was all but forgotten, resulting not even in a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
What prompted Nicholls? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea," Vernon said. "You'd have to ask him. I had my stick out so he 
wouldn't come into my crease, and all of a sudden he whacked me one. 
</P>
<P>
"He wound up from right field, for crying out loud." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls, though, said that he was hit first by Vernon, and not for the first 
time. Vernon, he said, frequently attempts to clear out the area in front of 
the net by poking trespassers with his stick. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to hit me then, when we were killing a penalty, I didn't think it was 
called for," Nicholls said. "But there's no use hitting him in the stomach or 
the pads. He deserved what I gave him." 
</P>
<P>
Vernon, whose jaw was clipped, said he was surprised to be punched because, 
"usually with Bernie, it's a stick." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in the third period of Game 1 Tuesday night, Vernon said, Nicholls 
whacked him over the head with his stick. 
</P>
<P>
True enough, Nicholls said. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, I've hit him in the pads, and that didn't get my point across," 
Nicholls said. "Tonight, I think I got my point across." 
</P>
<P>
But even with Murray on the ice, it didn't help the Kings, some of whom said 
they stopped on the play, believing the action would be blown dead. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy was hurt," said Nicholls, who was in position to know. "Why they didn't 
blow it dead is beyond me." 
</P>
<P>
The officials couldn't explain it. When McCauley is in attendance, one of them 
said, they are not allowed to speak to the media. 
</P>
<P>
So, the explanation was left to McCauley, a former official who was forced to 
retire in 1979 after being punched in the eye by a fan, his vision forever 
altered. 
</P>
<P>
And he said he's never experienced anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
"Very unusual," he said of the play. "Very, very unusual. It was a very unique 
happening that happened." 
</P>
<P>
That just about summed it up.

NEWSWIRE: EASLEY SUING SEAHAWKS OVER KIDNEY AILMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenny Easley, former Seattle Seahawks safety, has sued the National Football 
League team, claiming that he was allowed to play through the 1987 season 
without being told he had an irreversible kidney ailment that eventually ended 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
Easley's suit alleges that his kidneys were ruined by large doses of ibuprofen, 
a pain reliever. The 30-year-old former All-Pro undergoes dialysis three times 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
Easley's seven-year career ended last year after the kidney ailment was 
diagnosed. The discovery was made during a physical when the Seahawks attempted 
to trade Easley to the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Easley's suit in King County Superior Court alleges that his kidney problems 
were caused or substantially aggravated by large doses of Advil, a brand name 
for ibuprofen, while he was recovering from ankle surgery in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks an unspecified amount for loss of income, medical costs, 
reduction in earning capacity, mental and physical pain and suffering, and 
shortened life expectancy.

Thoroughbred trainer Roger Stein has sued Truesdail Laboratories of Tustin for 
"fraud, suppression of evidence, cover-up and laboratory malpractice," and 
asked for damages in excess of $25 million in a complaint filed in Los Angeles 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
A postrace test conducted by Truesdail on Emperor's Turn, a horse trained by 
Stein, last October at Santa Anita allegedly came up positive for cocaine, 
prompting track stewards to levy a six-month suspension and a $2,000 fine on 
the trainer. Stein is appealing the suspension and fine. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, Stein alleges that the lab intentionally destroyed a blood sample 
taken from Emperor's Turn before it could be examined by an independent 
laboratory, then attempted to cover up the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Norman Hester, president of Truesdail Laboratories, had no comment on the 
suit.

In a predawn test coinciding with the 50th anniversary of TV's debut at the New 
York World's Fair, NBC on Thursday transmitted what it called the first 
commercial broadcast of a high-definition TV signal in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Mike J. Sherlock, president of NBC Operations and Technical Services, said the 
broadcast "is to television what Kitty Hawk was to flight." But it made no 
difference in the picture that television viewers saw here. 
</P>
<P>
That's because TV sets capable of receiving what NBC called the Advanced 
Compatible Television Signal, which has double the 525 lines of conventional TV 
sets, are several years away from production. Existing TV sets can receive the 
high-tech signal but only display a standard picture. 
</P>
<P>
The test transmissions were conducted by the David Sarnoff Research Center in 
Princeton, N.J., which has been working on ways of improving TV-picture quality 
for six years. The research has been funded with $60 million by a consortium 
that includes NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Sherlock said other developments in the ACTV system will be demonstrated on 
April 29 at the National Assn. of Broadcasters' convention in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
High-definition television already is a reality in Japan, although only on a 
limited basis, with the higher-quality HDTV signal beamed via satellite to a 
relatively small number of homes equipped with special receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Regular HDTV broadcasts are to begin in Japan next year, Sherlock said. JAY

WARD'S DREAM PUT 'MAJOR LEAGUE' UNDERDOGS ON TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL KORNMAN, Kornman is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"One of the biggest disappointments of my young life was when the Cleveland 
Indians lost the World Series to the Giants," said screenwriter David Ward, who 
was 9 and living in Cleveland when the Indians blew their last chance in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
"It taught me that things don't always happen the way you think they should," 
he said. "It was a real crusher to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ward, who won a screenwriting Oscar for "The Sting," has had his own 
disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote and directed "Cannery Row," starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger, and 
wrote the adaptation for Robert Redford's "The Milagro Beanfield War." Neither 
was a commercial or critical success. 
</P>
<P>
His fascination for the game of baseball and his affection for the Indians 
persisted, along with his desire to write and direct a movie with major stars 
that would do big business at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said he wrote "Major League" without studio backing five years ago. "I 
followed (the Indians) over the years," Ward said, "hoping they would return to 
glory. Thirty-four years later, they still haven't won anything. I wanted to do 
a film about an underdog team and I can't think of a more underdog team than 
Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
This time out -- with full cooperation of the Cleveland Indians franchise, 
which approved the script, and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth -- 
the Indians would win. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a story of personal and team redemption," said Ward, who wanted his 
contemporary comedy about something "so quintessentially American" to look and 
feel like real baseball -- "The Not So Magnificent Seven." In spite of the 
spate of baseball movies in release and in production and the success of "Bull 
Durham," which had a similar storyline, Ward pressed for financing and a start 
date. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little concerned about (the other baseball movies), but they're 
different enough," Ward said. "I wanted to do a contemporary comedy about major 
league ball. In writing the script, which is about American values, I tried to 
figure out what is American. Baseball is a game we invented. We have a 
proprietary interest in it. We feel like it's our game. Baseball was a part of 
my social fabric. (The ball park) was a place to be with friends, to hang out." 
</P>
<P>
Ward's love of baseball and affection for an American tale of redemption was 
shared by Chris Chesser, a lifelong baseball fan and former New York-based film 
distributor. Now an independent producer in Los Angeles, he shares producer 
credit on "Major League" with Irby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Chesser grew up two blocks from the Cleveland Indians' spring training field in 
Tucson, home of the Tucson Toros. Chesser, who is collaborating with Ward on 
film and television projects, was equally committed to a contemporary comedy 
about the underdog team he knew so well coming up a winner. 
</P>
<P>
And Chesser thinks "Major League" has "blockbuster potential" in spring 
release, in spite of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not 'War and Peace,' " Chesser said, "it's a comedy with great 
dialogue that is extremely well executed." 
</P>
<P>
"Major League" is a surprise box-office hit for a baseball film. It has been 
America's most popular movie during its two weeks in release, taking in more 
than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said it was important to him that the audience feel a part of what is 
happening on screen in "Major League." 
</P>
<P>
"Other baseball movies used baseball in the background, or in a very 
unrealistic way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The plot mechanics are ridiculous. The actors couldn't play baseball. A lot of 
it lacked credibility. It has to be realistic. . . . It's very important to me 
to have it look and feel like real major league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"Miami Vice" production designer Jeffrey Howard was hired to give the picture 
visual wit and sparkle. And director of photography Reynaldo Villalobos, who 
shot the hits "Risky Business" and "Urban Cowboy," was signed on, partly 
because of his experience as a cameraman for "ABC Wide World of Sports" in the 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
The project was a challenge that held the promise of redemption, of a sort, for 
each of "Major League's" three stars, who said the movie allowed them to play 
out a childhood fantasy as well as prove something in the adult world of 
moviemaking. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Sheen, who plays a pitcher who steals cars in the off-season, sees his 
role as a larger-than-life portrait of the artist as reckless young man. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the most intense man on the team," Sheen said, but "Major League" is a 
comedy, so "there is less pressure on me as an actor. I (got) to show up on the 
set and laugh. It's different. It's light. I have done something finally that 
is a correlation of my dreams and my current profession." 
</P>
<P>
Sheen apparently had a pretty good fastball of his own when he was playing ball 
at Santa Monica High School. He said he was offered a baseball scholarship to 
the University of Kansas, but he was tempted away from college by a role in 
"Grizzly II, The Predator" a few days after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't regret not continuing with baseball," Sheen said, "but I'll always 
wonder." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing he still had a good fast ball -- clocked at more than 80 m.p.h. -- and 
wanting to see it on film, Sheen signed up for "Major League," a film that 
reunites him with his "Platoon" co-star Tom Berenger. 
</P>
<P>
Berenger plays the team's Wise Man, an over-the-hill catcher who counsels Sheen 
and pulls the team together in their last bid for glory. He trained for the 
role with technical adviser Steve Yeager, the ex-Dodger catcher who retired in 
1987 and now sells cars in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of earlier injuries that made training painful, Berenger said he 
proved to himself that he could stretch his hamstrings, make his knees work and 
catch like a pro. With his left hip and knee broken in a car accident a few 
years ago, doing physical roles is "not as easy as it used to be," Berenger 
said, but Yeager wouldn't let him quit until he was done, and he wouldn't stop 
until it was right. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin Bernsen cut short a vacation in Rome with Amanda Pays and commuted 
between Los Angeles and Tucson to take the role of Dorn, written as Beck, which 
he felt sounded a little too much like Arnie Becker, his "L.A. Law" persona. 
</P>
<P>
He was completing work on "Bert Rigby, You're a Fool" for director Carl Reiner, 
but showed up on the Tucson playing field with his own Dodgers gear, soon 
replaced with Indians gear, and a special request. 
</P>
<P>
Although his baseball character wears an ascot and carries a briefcase, Bernsen 
didn't want Beck to be confused with his work on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
Ward agreed to change the name from Beck to Dorn, but similarities in the vain, 
womanizing character remain. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Bernsen said he hoped "Major League" would help pull him out of the 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
"I know these are name movie actors," he said, but I hope they saw the 
possibility in this movie for an ensemble film . . . I hope I'll get to the 
point where it's my name that's the bankability factor." 
</P>
<P>
He is always looking for ways to show what is behind his blue eyes and easy 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to create a character that will make you say, 'Yeah, blue eyes, nice 
haircut. Nice car. What? Oh, I see. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
With "Major League," Bernsen said, "I think people will start to see I can do 
other things."

'IRANIAN NIGHTS' THINLY VEILS RUSHDIE CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some events cannot live up to the hype they generate. 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty much what happened Wednesday at the much-ballyhooed opening of 
"Iranian Nights" -- a thinly disguised theatrical defense of Salman Rushdie, 
author of "The Satanic Verses." It turned out to be pretty much an evening for 
the already converted, the simply curious and the eager media. 
</P>
<P>
This 45-minute defense of free speech by playwright Howard Brenton in 
collaboration with writer Tariq Ali played to a packed audience at the 397-seat 
Royal Court Theatre. Security was thick, television crews from various nations 
-- including the United States, Germany and Italy -- prowled the crowds. But 
the potentially explosive event went off without an incident. Better a whimper 
than a bang this time. May it be thus for the rest of the play's limited run, 
ending next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The piece, which was hastily written (in five days, in a dressing room at the 
Royal Court, by Brenton's own account) and almost as hastily produced, could be 
described as a major non-event. If support for the Rushdie cause was the goal, 
there were no endorsing celebrities (or other people in high places) on hand to 
lend the evening any additional weight. Excessive hype, and London's wariness 
and weariness over the Rushdie affair may have kept them away. The better part 
of the audience consisted of critics, reporters of various nationalities and 
stripes and a handful of self-professed friends of Rushdie's eager to be quoted 
-- on and off camera. 
</P>
<P>
As for real fireworks, they didn't happen. The play itself is an entertaining 
and even witty allegory wherein a Caliph (Nabil Shaban), a poet (Paul 
Battacharjee as Omar Khayam) and a belly-dancing Sheherezade (Fiona Victory) 
play fast and loose with the "Tales of a Thousand and One Nights." 
</P>
<P>
The tale this Sheherezade has to tell to save her neck sounds remarkably 
familiar. It's the story of modern Iran, where an emperor (read the late Shah 
Reza Pahlevi) is in the thrall of Satan (read the United States). Satan gave 
the emperor "all his heart desired: 3 million swords, a million crossbows and 
28 Cadillacs" in exchange for an oil monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
A far-off Holy Man (read the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini) saw to it that the 
emperor was brought down. Taking over the country in the emperor's place (and 
behaving as badly or worse) he became outraged when a poet (read Rushdie) 
belonging to a family of true believers on a small far-off island (in the grip 
of Satan and "where two queens sit on one throne") wrote a blasphemous book. 
When the Caliph asks Sheherezade the nature of the blasphemy, she replies: "No 
one knows. It was a book that nobody could read." 
</P>
<P>
You can take it from there. The piece is overt agitprop by a playwright 
(Brenton) not especially renowned for subtleties, and a writer and former 
anti-Vietnam War radical (Ali) who once marched on the U.S. Embassy in London 
and burned the flag. 
</P>
<P>
As a humorous political tract, "Iranian Nights" is just short enough and benign 
enough to cause no major offense or international incident -- and to slap 
Britain (and the United States and, for that matter, the so-called free world) 
on the wrist for knuckling under to the Ayatollah's terrorist pressure. Its 
second half updates itself to modern times and turns more serious and chiding, 
concluding with a reading of the names of past writers singed at the stake of 
political repression, including Oscar Wilde, Bertolt Brecht, Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez and Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
Director Penny Cherns has turned out an accomplished performance of these 
"Nights," modestly bedecked in a setting of pillows and curtains that -- 
appropriately -- looks like something from the cover for a box of Turkish 
Delight (Colin Piggott is the designer). But "Iranian Nights" has the built-in 
limitations common to most propaganda as theater: It is narrow in scope and 
unlikely to survive beyond its immediate and specific purpose. Call this one 
"Much Ado About Something," though perhaps not quite enough. 
</P>
<P>
Other comments in the British press included Charles Spencer's assessment in 
the Daily Telegraph that "it was never on the cards that 'Iranian Nights' would 
turn out to be a work of subtle sensitivity. . . . The play has many hard 
things to say about militant Islam, but is also robustly entertaining with some 
excellent jokes." 
</P>
<P>
"The play itself offers us no esthetic bolt-holes," wrote Irving Wardle in the 
Times. "Brenton describes it as a 'pin prick for free speech.' It's purpose is 
to keep alive the sense of outrage over 'The Satanic Verses' affair before the 
normalization process sets in. It is not a well-organized play. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Said Michael Coveney in the Financial Times: "Ali/Brenton, as opposed to Ali 
Baba, lace fantasy with fact, argument and a vivid concern. . . . (The play's) 
very compression is a virtue denying the conventional expectations of civilised 
dramatic development . . . the disguise of it in hasty clothing is in itself a 
valid theatrical ploy."

A ROREM PREMIERE AS COCTEAU FEST MOVES TO USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Launched at Irvine in February, a yearlong Southern California observance of 
Jean Cocteau's centenary continues this week at USC. The modest beginning of 
this portion of the celebration took place in Bing Theater on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Gadfly composer Ned Rorem -- who, of course, knew the French designer, writer 
and film maker in Paris in the 1950s -- talked about Cocteau for the better 
part of an hour. Then, with soprano Jennifer Trost, the composer presented six 
of his early songs, and observed, with a small but elite audience, the world 
premiere performance of his "Anna La Bonne," written this year to a text by 
Cocteau. 
</P>
<P>
A pleasant tribute, this little gathering offered nothing novel or startling. 
The new work, which Rorem described in his program note as owing "much to 
Poulenc," is actually a brief scena, a monologue in which a maid, the Anna of 
the title, describes her feelings toward her dead mistress. 
</P>
<P>
Trost, authoritatively supported by pianist Douglas Fisher, sang the new piece 
with aggressive skill, and enacted Frans Boerlage's integral staging smoothly. 
It is a work of easy charm and menacing nonchalance; other resourceful singers 
may choose to display its effects without resort to staging or costume, for its 
substance lies in words and notes. 
</P>
<P>
When assisted elegantly by the composer at the piano, the young soprano brought 
a resplendent voice and considerable textual probing to the fascinating group 
of songs Rorem had chosen -- and written between 1947 and 1963 (the year of 
Cocteau's death). If she shortchanged the full dramatic thrust of both "Jack 
L'Enventreur" and "Visit to St. Elizabeths,", Trost found many charms, and most 
of the wistfulness, in "The Lordly Hudson," "For Poulenc," "I am Rose" and 
"Early in the Morning." 
</P>
<P>
To start, Rorem read some of his own reminiscences of Cocteau -- more than a 
few of them recognizable as excerpts from his "Nantucket Diary" (1987). As his 
readers know, Rorem is a highly literate and amusing, if increasingly 
non-self-revealing, diarist. This spoken recital followed that pattern, and 
offered few personal glimpses of Cocteau as Rorem may have known him. DANIEL

Last Sunday marked the 100th anniversary of Charlie Chaplin's birth, and Key 
Video is celebrating the occasion this week with the re-release of 11 tapes 
containing the comedian/director's greatest films at the bargain price of 
$19.98. Included are "City Lights," "Modern Times," "Monsieur Verdoux," "The 
Great Dictator" and a combined "The Kid"/"The Idle Class." 
</P>
<P>
Another classic new on videocassette this week is "The Merry Widow" (MGM/UA, 
$29.95), the 1934 Ernst Lubitsch comedy/musical starring Maurice Chevalier and 
Jeanette MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
On a far less sublime level, the week's video pickings include the action 
thriller with the silliest movie title of 1988, "Amsterdamned" (Vestron, 
$89.98, R), and the silly-headed "Cocktail" (Touchstone, $89.95, R), featuring 
Tom Cruise as an acrobatic bartender -- before "Rain Man" made him respectable 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Other new releases include (remarkably soon after its theatrical release) "Some 
Girls" (MGM/UA, $89.95, R), which The Times' Sheila Benson called "a smart, 
enticing enchantment that may be the first sexual comedy to look like an Art 
Nouveau fairy tale," "Memories of Me" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13), a father-son 
comedy/drama with Alan King and Billy Crystal, "Nijinsky" (Paramount, no 
suggested price), a 1980 movie about the great, eccentric dancer, directed by 
Herbert Ross ("The Turning Point"), "Under the Gun" (Magnum, $79.98, R), a 
violent thriller starring singer/former Miss America Vanessa Williams, and 
several Nelson Eddy/Jeanette MacDonald musicals from the '30s and early '40s: 
"Sweethearts," "I Married an Angel," "The Girl of the Golden West," "Bitter 
Sweet" and "The Chocolate Soldier" ($29.95 each). 
</P>
<P>

OTHER VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
Chaplin also figures in what's perhaps the most carefully crafted, informative 
and entertaining documentary series ever made about the silent film. 
"Hollywood," shown both on PBS and in commercial-channel syndication, is now 
available in thirteen 52-minute volumes from HBO ($19.99 each). The superb 
series, put together by David Gill and Kevin Brownlow and narrated by James 
Mason, features detailed, often revelatory looks at the more important aspects 
of the art. Chaplin and Buster Keaton are the focus of the excellent "Comedy -- 
A Serious Business" entry. 
</P>
<P>
Legends from a different field are captured in concert film seen previously 
only on Cinemax cable: "Jimi Hendrix: Live in Monterey, 1967" and "Otis 
Redding: Live in Monterey, 1967" are the complete performances (seen in part in 
"Monterey Pop"). Both are available from HBO ($19.99) as are "The Doors: Live 
in Europe, 1968" and "John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band: Live Peace in 
Toronto, 1969." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount is releasing three of the "Live from Lincoln Center" performances 
seen on PBS: "The Barber of Seville" (1976, Beverly Sills), "Giselle" (1977, 
Natalia Makarova, Mikhail Baryshinikov) and "An Evening with Danny Kaye" 
(1981). The tapes carry no suggested retail price -- check with your dealer for 
details regarding rental or purchase. TERRY ATKINSON

'20/20' TAKES A LOOK AT PALISADES HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"60 Minutes" already has done a segment on alcohol and drug abuse among 
teen-agers in Pacific Palisades. Now comes ABC's "20/20" with a somewhat 
controversial version at 10 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
</P>
<P>
The Palisades has been shaken by an unusual number of teen fatalities related 
to drugs or alcohol. In researching the "20/20" story, producer Joe Lovett and 
his crew angered Palisades High School psychologist Linda Swimmer-Levine by 
filming at -- but not trying to stop -- a party on a perilous bluff where drugs 
and alcohol were in use. School officials had alerted police to the party, but 
no police showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"20/20" uses brief footage from the party to demonstrate the prevalence and 
easy accessibility of drugs and alcohol among Palisades teen-agers, blaming 
much of it on affluent parents who are inattentive or too submissive. 
</P>
<P>
Reported by Stone Phillips, the segment is basically positive, however, finding 
hope in community-encouraged therapy groups that help children and their 
parents better understand each other and cope with many of the problems that 
have brought the Palisades so much grief. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades High School is characterized here as both an institution of high 
academic performance and high drug and alcohol use. What "20/20" doesn't ask 
tonight is how both are possible at the same school. HOWARD ROSENBERG

Argentine director Rafael Filippelli's look at the days before his country's 
1976 coup d'etat operates on a classic movie "clock" -- that is, the shift in 
power that will lead (we're told at the beginning of the film) to the 
"disappearance" of its union leader protagonist. This film's doomed agitators 
of the left seem oddly passionless outside of their politics (a last-minute 
love affair is more like a last meal for the condemned), which might be part of 
Filippelli's point but is a sticking point for involvement in his characters' 
inevitable fate. CHRIS WILLMAN

This second program of NFB shorts showcases experimental and/or multimedia 
works: "Christmas Cracker" by Norman McLaren and "Monsieur Pointu" by Bernard 
Longpre and Andre LeDuc blend live action with stop-motion animation. Peter 
Foldes' "Hunger," the first computer-animated film to be nominated for an 
academy award, features ugly line figures utterly unlike the bright, 
three-dimensional objects in this year's winner, "Tin Toy. " Ryan Larkin uses 
simple ink wash drawings to express an unallayed joy in pure movement in 
"Walking." RECOMMENDED. CHARLES SOLOMON

ARCHITECTURE: OUT OF EARTHQUAKE'S RUBBLE RISES SOVIET-U.S. TEAMWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turning on his TV as he sat down to breakfast last Dec. 7, Ron Altoon expected 
to see the usual commemoration of Pearl Harbor. But the images on his screen 
were more immediate in their horror. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake that measured 6.9 on the Richter scale had wrought terrible 
destruction in Soviet Armenia: 55,000 people would die and 500,000 would be 
homeless as whole towns collapsed into rubble. 
</P>
<P>
As an architect, Altoon was deeply affected by the destruction. As an Armenian, 
he was personally touched by the deaths of thousands of his countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be my own family dying out there," he said. "I wrote several checks, 
but they didn't make me feel any better. I felt strongly that I had to step 
into this more personally." 
</P>
<P>
So Altoon, a commercial architect in Los Angeles with his own firm, Altoon and 
Porter, decided to organize a team of American architects to visit the Soviet 
Union to help plan the rebuilding of an Armenian city. After months of 
bureaucratic and diplomatic delay, six Californians, led by Altoon, spent two 
weeks in late March in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, laying out a proposal for 
the reconstruction of the demolished city of Spitak. 
</P>
<P>
The California team's plan was a success and ultimately was selected by the 
Soviets in place of their own design for the new city of 25,000 people. The 
Altoon group's vision was more imaginative than the Soviet architects': It not 
only took into account the hillside setting of Spitak, but it also favored 
traditional Armenian architectural style instead of cold, impersonal concrete 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"You have understood the culture of our land better than we ourselves have," 
said Ashod Alexanian, chief of the Armenian division of Gosstroi, the Soviet 
state construction agency. "You have helped us understand our past and the 
vital role it can play in our future." 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Platonov, head of the Union of Soviet Architects, reportedly hailed the 
California plan as a double first. The California team was the first group of 
U.S. architects ever invited to collaborate with Soviet colleagues. And the 
Spitak plan was the first time an American concept had ever been adopted for 
the design of a Soviet city. 
</P>
<P>
In the months before he was able to enter the Soviet Union, Altoon and the five 
other architects, who are from the Bay Area, studied the architecture, 
politics, history and poetry of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I'm Armenian, I was raised American in Los Feliz," Altoon said. "I 
speak a few words of the language, and that's about it. The quake made me eager 
to understand the spirit of a people who've always had to struggle for 
survival, against human persecution and natural disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is home to about 350,000 Armenians, the largest population 
outside the Soviet Union. The California team arrived in Yerevan, the capital 
of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, on March 20. Its visit to Armenia 
was backed by the Los Angeles branch of the Armenian Assembly and sponsored by 
the state chapter and the national Washington headquarters of the American 
Institute of Architects. Touring the quake-shattered region of northern Armenia 
revived and intensified Altoon's sense of shock at the magnitude of the human 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Bombed Cities' 
</P>
<P>
"Spitak and Leninakan were like bombed cities," he said. "Three months after 
the event, rubble was everywhere. People still looked stunned. I remember one 
old man outside Spitak who stood staring at the ruined town for hours on end. 
He seemed turned to stone by the horror and the loss -- except for the single 
tear that ran down his cheek from time to time." Thirty-two mountain villages 
surrounding Spitak had been destroyed, Altoon's team discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets welcomed the Americans warmly but were skeptical about the 
usefulness of yet another bunch of well-intentioned "tourists." Teams from 
Norway and Italy and from two Soviet republics were already in Armenia planning 
cities and building new hospitals and temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
One difficulty for the Californians was the primitive and bureaucratic 
character of the Soviet building industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Put simply, Soviet construction technology is a disaster," Altoon said. "Since 
the Russian Revolution, the Soviets have used a precast concrete system that 
requires much more precision than their primitive methods are capable of." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designs Ignore Differences 
</P>
<P>
The standard Soviet building designs consist of cement units actually poured in 
a factory and then transported to sites and assembled. If the assembly isn't 
done very carefully, they are prone to problems. Altoon added that the 
centrally planned units used all over the vast territory of the Soviet Union 
ignore "regional climatic, seismic and geological variations." 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of thousands of such badly built structures was a principal cause 
of death and injury during the recent quake. In addition to the shoddy 
construction technology, the Soviet system provides for no independent 
supervision of building quality by architects or inspectors. And there is no 
Soviet seismic building code setting strict standards for earthquake resistance 
similar to the ordinances that govern the construction of buildings in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no area where Gorbachev's famous perestroika (restructuring) is more 
literally needed than in the Soviet construction industry," Altoon said. 
"Cities like Spitak were disasters waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The first task for the U.S. designers was to critique the plan for Spitak's 
reconstruction drawn up by the Soviet architects. This potentially sensitive 
moment was made easier by the invitation, expressed by Hratch Poghossian, 
director of the Armenian Design Institute, to "take your gloves off, comrades. 
We're all architects here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outdated Planning Ideas 
</P>
<P>
The Americans found the Soviet design inadequate. Their proposed layout, 
consisting of a rigid street grid with oversized boulevards, failed to take 
into account the hillside site for the new Spitak, several miles away from the 
destroyed city. The American team's consensus was the Soviet plan represented 
an outdated 1950s notion of city planning long discredited in the West, with 
boring, straight, endless blocks of no visual interest. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling up their sleeves, the Californians set to work for up to 17 hours a 
day. They sketched, argued and sketched some more. Their inspiration was in the 
architectural tradition of Armenia and the desire to offer the traumatized 
people a new kind of city -- open, communal and filled with light and air. 
</P>
<P>
"Spitak means white in the eastern Armenian dialect," Altoon said. "The 
traditional local building material is a soft volcanic stone called tufa, which 
varies in color from a soft beige to a reddish brown. When the sun catches it, 
it turns to gold. An airy sense of white and gold was the feeling we wanted in 
our design." And tufa is a major component in the Americans' final design for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Tufa churches and monasteries celebrating an ancient Armenian Christianity dot 
the bare hillsides of the republic and neighboring Azerbaijan. The style of 
such 14th-Century masterpieces as St. Stephanos or St. Thadei' Vank is fortress 
Romanesque. Castle walls enclose towers and spires in golden stone covered with 
elaborate carvings of shepherds and warriors. 
</P>
<P>
When the California architects presented their Spitak design to the Soviets on 
March 31, they were greeted with great applause. Stopping over in Moscow on 
their way home, the Californians were also warmly hailed by architects in the 
Soviet capital. "What you have done is put in place a U.S.-Soviet collaboration 
that has eluded us for years," Platonov said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convention Visit 
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up, Platonov will visit the AIA national convention in St. Louis in 
June to participate with Altoon and his colleagues in a panel discussion of the 
Spitak plan. And on Thursday, Altoon will make a presentation of the plan to 
the local chapter of the AIA in the Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian disaster, Altoon said, "has taught me a great lesson in humanity."

A NEW KIND OF BACHELOR FATHER; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN SINGLE WOMEN OPT FOR PARENTHOOD, THE MAN ISN'T ALWAYS IN ON THE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was a Jewish/Unitarian minister hitchhiking at the corner of Venice and 
Sepulveda. And he had no idea the woman who picked him up had long sought to be 
what she considered a "politically correct" single mom. 
</P>
<P>
Before meeting him, she had even placed an ad for a man to father her child in 
the liberal Mother Jones magazine, figuring "men of the political left were 
more open to alternate forms of parenting." 
</P>
<P>
But years later, after failing to woo a set of desirable genes with her 
classified come-on, L.A. Weekly Health Editor Carolyn Reuben had given up 
classified ads for serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
She remembers reading the hitchhiker's apparel accurately: "Professional man 
temporarily stranded without a car." She pulled over. He hopped in. As she 
recounts what followed, the two 38-year-olds fell instantly, magically in lust 
-- possibly even love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Knew This Was It' 
</P>
<P>
"We just both knew this was it. . . . We started trying to have a child right 
away. We were sure we were going to be a family," says Jonathan Reich, the 
hitchhiking clergyman who worked at the Unitarian Society Los Angeles West when 
the couple met in late 1985. 
</P>
<P>
By May of '86, they'd created a pregnancy. And by August, they'd split up. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out that we didn't get along, that we could never make our 
relationship work. But she really wanted to have the baby," says Reich, now 42. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the dilemma that more and more men are facing as the biological clocks of 
their single, childless sex partners wind down. 
</P>
<P>
Consider just a few of the possible permutations when a pregnancy occurs but 
the mother wishes to remain unmarried: 
</P>
<P>
Does the father consider himself a mere sperm provider -- a surrogate father, 
as it were -- free to walk away from fatherhood and its 
legal/financial/emotional responsibilities? 
</P>
<P>
Or does he jump in, get involved in the pregnancy, childbirth and rearing of 
the child even though he may have neutral or even angry feelings for the 
mother? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might Prefer Self-Destruction 
</P>
<P>
How about the guy who wants to participate in fathering, but the mother would 
prefer he simply disappear or self-destruct? 
</P>
<P>
Or the man who has been asked by a woman to father a child for her, but with 
the knowledge that there will be no romantic involvement and perhaps no 
co-parenting privileges? Can he live with that initially -- and perhaps later, 
when there is a child eager to know its father? 
</P>
<P>
Nobody keeps statistics on how many men find themselves pondering these and 
other complexities of the late 20th Century, but there are some indicators that 
suggest the number is likely growing. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's annual Southern California Social Survey found that attitudes toward 
single motherhood have loosened considerably. A whopping 50% of Southern 
California women surveyed said that, if they were to find themselves childless 
and approaching the end of their childbearing years, they would consider having 
a child without a husband or live-in partner. 
</P>
<P>
According to UCLA social psychologist Belinda Tucker, who supervised the 
marital questions area of the survey, men were not asked if they would consider 
fathering a child for a single woman outside of marriage. But after a report of 
the survey's results was recently published in The Times, Tucker received 
plenty of incensed, if informal feedback. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction of a lot of men around here (UCLA) and a lot of people who called 
was a threatened one," she says. "They really didn't like the fact that so many 
women would say 'You're not needed.' I kind of wish now that we had asked men 
that question." 
</P>
<P>
And Dr. Kyle Pruett, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University and 
author of the recently published "The Nurturing Father," reports that since his 
book has come out, "I've heard of, well, I guess the adjective is a startling 
number of stories of men who have considered themselves rather casual 
biological donors, witting or unwitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the one thing that I would want to emphasize is that no matter how 
casually a man may think about this at the begining of the relationship or 
non-relationship, it comes as quite a surprise to many men to learn that a 
donation of spermatozoa often carries with it more than protein," Pruett says. 
"And that the emotional interest in the fetus, its health, its growth and 
development and its eventual birth and delivery have captivated more than a few 
of them, even when they're not emotionally involved with the women. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that their genetic contribution takes shape in another body haunts 
many of them emotionally, many more than you would think." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information Found Him 
</P>
<P>
Pruett stresses that he didn't go looking for this information. It found him -- 
rather off-guard as it turned out. "I sort of bought the party line before, the 
sort of one-night-stand male sperm contribution, disappearing on the morning 
train," he admits. "It turns out to be maybe a myth we'd like to perpetuate 
because it makes the situation easier to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the minister and the health editor, the relationship quickly 
turned disagreeable. However, both agreed they "weren't committed to each 
other, but we were both committed to the child," Reich says. Thus he attended 
natural childbirth classes with Reuben, took pictures during the birth and cut 
their daughter's umbilical cord. 
</P>
<P>
Though both parents acknowledge there were hot fights over visitation 
scheduling -- and threats of solving the problem in court -- the two eventually 
worked through their differences on their own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Healed' 
</P>
<P>
"Gradually what happened over time was that we healed from the hurt we had 
inflicted on each other," says Reich, who is a doctoral student now married to 
a professor in De Kalb, Ill., with whom he is expecting a child in November. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he flies to Los Angeles every six to eight weeks to visit his 
daughter and regularly sends Reuben child support payments, "giving what I 
think is generous and what I can afford . . . it means I skip the $3.50 gourmet 
lunch in the chandelier room and make myself a sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
As for Reuben, she's pleased with the way in which the arrangement finally 
worked out and says she has been approached by several single men eager to be 
fathers asking if she knows any more women looking to become single moms. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think is absolutely necessary is not a mating service, but a referral 
service to connect the men who are longing to be fathers with the women who are 
longing to be mothers," she concludes. "If love looms, that's wonderful. But it 
doesn't have to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Vacha would agree. A gay man who lives in San Francisco, he clearly 
wasn't in love with the lesbian woman for whom he agreed to father a child. 
</P>
<P>
But he had been wanting to have a child for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Unfulfilled Need 
</P>
<P>
"I have a nurturing side of me that needs to be fulfilled," he explains. "I 
didn't believe the fact that I'm gay should be an obstacle in stopping me from 
loving a child. And having known so many people from 'broken' homes where 
there's been ugly divorce and they seemed to survive, I thought it was possible 
to have a two-household family where there was a lot of love for the child." 
</P>
<P>
After discussing this possibility with several heterosexual women, Vacha says 
he was distressed to learn that their first questions seemed to center on 
money: "How are we going to do this financially?" Vacha claims he wasn't 
opposed to contributing child support but after he gave his name to the leader 
of an East Bay group called Lesbians Considering Motherhood, he found the 
potential mothers there "more financially independent" and concerned about the 
emotional welfare of a child. 
</P>
<P>
With one of them, he wound up discussing the possibility of a co-parenting 
arrangement, a discussion that continued off and on for 2 1/2 years before it 
reached fruition. 
</P>
<P>
"We had similar temperaments. I felt we were able to resolve conflicts. She was 
actively looking for a father to be actively involved. That was the only way 
I'd do it," says Vacha, 37, a social service administrator, writer and author 
of "Quiet Fire: Memoirs of Older Gay Men." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At-Home Project 
</P>
<P>
A simple, at-home artificial insemination was arranged, with the woman using an 
eyedropper of Vacha's sperm. "A lot of people are under the impression they 
have to go to a doctor's office when it's the oldest, easiest thing to do," he 
points out. 
</P>
<P>
(Indeed, according to Los Angeles psychologist Annette Baran, co-author of 
"Lethal Secrets, The Shocking Consequences and Unsolved Problems of Artificial 
Insemination," the practice of such at-home, low-tech artificial insemination 
has been commonplace since the late 19th Century. "We've been using it for 100 
years," she says. "We learned it from animal husbandry. You don't need any 
special equipment or training.") 
</P>
<P>
Because Vacha and the mother of their child have been open about their birthing 
and parenting arrangement, theirs is not the sort of clandestine arrangement 
chastised in Baran's book -- which argues against keeping donor insemination 
pregnancies a secret from the offspring and others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Without Problems 
</P>
<P>
But that's not to imply Vacha's co-parenting experience has been entirely 
problem-free. 
</P>
<P>
"I was involved through the entire pregnancy. I was at the birth . . . and took 
care of the baby alone when she was 6 months old," Vacha recalls, adding that 
his daughter is now 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our problems are the same as any parents . . . trying to bring up a 
healthy child in a difficult world. You want the child to feel free and good 
about herself, for instance, and know she has unlimited potential. But at the 
same time you have to turn around and say, 'No, you can't throw things against 
the wall.' I think everyone goes through that." 
</P>
<P>
Vacha doesn't anticipate any unusual difficulties stemming from the fact that 
both the child's parents are gay. "She's growing up in a world with a lot of 
gay people and heterosexual people both," he notes. "And she goes to a school 
where there are many different kinds of parenting situations." 
</P>
<P>
Even one of Vacha's relatives who warned he'd be miserable with the arrangement 
and "stuck with all the financial responsibilities," wound up being the first 
to send him a Father's Day card. And he points to a bonus he didn't count on in 
the beginning. He and the mother of his child "have come to care for and love 
each other -- the only thing our daughter gets from us is respect and care, a 
lot of positive enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the men for whom Father's Day greetings are either nonexistent 
or excruciating reminders of battles lost, feelings ignored, rights denied? 
</P>
<P>
"For many of the guys I get (coming to United Fathers of America), becoming a 
father is not voluntary. They're not told that in the beginning," says Rod 
Bivings, president and founder of United Fathers of America, which is based in 
Los Angeles. "I have yet to get a case in which a woman has asked a man to 
father her child. Usually it stems from the normal series of (sexual) events." 
</P>
<P>
Bivings' organization represents fathers with all sorts of paternity, 
visitation and custody disputes, and he estimates that between 25% and 30% of 
the group's 1,000 paid members are single men who have fathered children the 
old-fashioned way -- through physical intimacy -- and who have then been denied 
what the organization considers to be their father's rights. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that "the responsibility for birth control should belong to 
both men and women," and points out that as a result of deceptions, today's men 
are "becoming more careful about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Very Hot Topic' 
</P>
<P>
"(The issue has) become a very hot topic," Bivings continues. "I hear about 
some of those it turns out well for, but men don't come to see me unless 
they're in a world of hurt and need a way to solve their problems. This is sort 
of like their last resort." 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles man in such a world of hurt says he unwittingly fathered a 
child after a brief sexual relationship with a woman. The man, who agreed to 
speak only on condition of anonymity, claims the woman broke off their sexual 
relationship after she became pregnant and eventually told him to get lost. 
</P>
<P>
He says his attorney has advised him that it might not even be worth it for him 
to gain legal visitation rights -- because the mother had demonstrated her 
willingness to lie about his conduct during court hearings, and because she 
apparently is intent on fighting an expensive, emotionally draining legal 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he won visitation rights, the man says his attorney warned him that the 
mother could continue to lie to the court about his behavior with the child, 
and he could easily face additional trauma and aggravation during the child's 
first 18 years. Or the mother could move out of state, in which case he would 
still have to pay child support -- which is automatically adjudicated with 
visitation rights -- yet have a difficult time seeing his child. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the man, who says he was duped into fathering the child, is upset 
that he has no visitation rights and is unhappy with his attorney's advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Beyond Sad' 
</P>
<P>
"I could be in this for years, paying money to an attorney while paper is 
floated back and forth and I still wouldn't be able to see the child. It's 
cruel. It's beyond sad," he says. "I have to treat this as though my child is 
dead. I am in a serious period of grief and nobody cares. I love my child. I 
was trying to do something decent, being a father." 
</P>
<P>
The man says his attorney has advised him to walk away, find a wife, start a 
new life and have another child -- all for his own good. 
</P>
<P>
His response? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even trust women anymore at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
According to Dick Woods, director of Iowa-based National Congress of Men, the 
man's situation is hardly rare. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of paternity by deception," says Woods, whose group serves as a 
clearinghouse for men's rights groups such as United Fathers of America. 
"Father's rights cases have generally not done well in the courts. Probably 
half of those who have brought the cases have won some kinds of rights, but the 
father has to have the money and the stick-to-it-iveness to go through a very 
difficult process." 
</P>
<P>
For that and other reasons, Woods' organization routinely advises men not to 
participate in knowingly fathering children for single women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Rights Noted 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly recommend against it, mainly because of (the man's) liability and 
lack of rights," he says. ". . . First off, he is at tremendous risk of her 
quitting her job, going on ADC (Aid to Dependent Children), then if she has 
personally agreed and maybe even signed a legal paper not to come after him for 
child support -- even if that's happened, when she goes on ADC, the state will 
come after him anyway for money. That's a federal law." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitation Rights 
</P>
<P>
As for state laws, Woods adds that there are wide variations among the states 
on visitation rights, paternity statutes and custody procedures. 
</P>
<P>
But frequently, amicable solutions are created outside the judicial system. One 
man who reached an out-of-court settlement for joint custody of a son he 
fathered is Bret Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sobering," says Hampton, 39, recalling the time he learned he had a 
son. "I was closing in on 30 and it came at a time when I was starting to 
wonder if I was going to be married and have kids." 
</P>
<P>
Though the mother of his son refused to even talk to him for quite a while 
after their child was born, Hampton remembers that he persistently tried to 
make peace with her and to win the right to interact with the boy, now 9. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now she and I are getting along pretty well but it's taken years to get 
to this point," says Hampton, a video editor who works in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As for his son's feelings, Hampton feels he's become comfortable with the 
arrangement: "On one hand, all he's ever known is he has two parents who don't 
live together. I think he'd like one of us to get married. He sometimes asks me 
if I'm going to get married -- or asks the person I'm dating." 
</P>
<P>
Though Hampton is obviously delighted to have a son in his life, he's adamant 
that he would never help a single woman have a child if he were asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I like kids too much," Hampton insists. "I'd want to be involved. It would 
bother me too much not to know what was happening. I think you make a mistake 
if you assume anything."

CAR SALESMAN TALK OF PERILS, PRECAUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, Bill Nelson, used-car manager at Barish Chrysler-Plymouth, tried to calm 
a sales staff that was "real shook up." Then he put into effect a buddy system 
requiring that a ride-along sit in the back when a salesperson takes a 
prospective buyer out for a demo drive. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson was still trying to make some kind of sense out of what had 
happened: Charles Washington, 61, a Barish salesman giving a demo ride in a 
1989 Chrysler sports car Monday evening, had simply vanished, along with the 
car and the customer. And as of midday Thursday, police said they had no leads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Heart Ailment 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm concerned," said Detective Carl Thompson of LAPD's Wilshire 
division. "I would think (Washington) would have been back by now if everything 
was on the up and up," that he would at least have telephoned his employer or 
his family. Washington's wife, Zetha, told police her husband has a heart 
ailment that requires medication. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he knew of no cases where a car salesman had met with foul play 
while taking a customer on a demo drive, but he recalled a case of a real 
estate saleswoman slain while showing a property to a client. "Unfortunately," 
he said, "in this day and age a lot of things are becoming high risk that never 
were before." 
</P>
<P>
To Bill Nelson, it just didn't figure. He knows Washington to be "very 
streetwise, a very savvy man . . . he always looks at their driver's license. 
He knows whom he's talking to. This man's an old professional. He'd been here 
five or six years." 
</P>
<P>
There have been other, less troubling, incidents involving salespersons at 
Barish, which is in a mid-town location in the 400 block of South La Brea 
Avenue. A few years ago, Nelson recalled, "We had a customer take off with a 
salesman and leave him in the middle of Watts. Another was dumped in the desert 
and had to walk three miles to a telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Car salesmen "make their living by judging people," Nelson observed. "If our 
salesmen have any premonition they've got somebody who's not who they say they 
are," they are not encouraged to take them out in the car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Description Given 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the customer was a 25- or 30-year-old blond man of medium height 
who had walked onto the Barish lot about 7 p.m. "Ostensibly," Nelson said, 
"they were going over to show (the car to) the guy's father, who supposedly was 
the manager of a bank." 
</P>
<P>
That seemed "quite feasible," he added, noting that the dealership has an 
"affluent" clientele and that it is not unusual "to take cars to movie people's 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
A few people who saw the man observed that "he didn't look like he could buy a 
car," Nelson said, "but neither do a lot of people in our neighborhood, and 
they'll write a check for it. Some of the most affluent-looking people couldn't 
buy a bus ticket out of town." 
</P>
<P>
The missing car is a bright red Chrysler Conquest TSI, with a sticker price of 
$21,000. "The guy obviously didn't go for inconspicuous," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
As police search for Washington, the young man and the car, which is in the 
police system as stolen, Nelson has instructed the sales staff to take down 
driver's license information from all prospective buyers and to leave that data 
with another salesperson before driving off the lot. "Even if the address isn't 
valid," he said, "the police have someplace to start. In this instance we 
haven't any idea." 
</P>
<P>
He thought again about Washington, an employee he described as "very punctual, 
very reliable," and said, "This guy must have been pretty smooth. Charles has 
refused on various occasions" to give lookers a demo ride, insisting first on a 
TRW credit check. 
</P>
<P>
From now on Nelson's lot man, Arman Kepekchian, will ride in the back seat 
whenever a salesperson takes a client for a drive. Beyond these precautions, he 
observed, there's not much more to be done -- "You can't run an armed camp." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has happened, thank God," said John Anton, sales manager at Porsche 
Audi of Downtown L.A., which is also open evenings for sales. "But we are 
downtown. And downtown at night in Los Angeles . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Routinely, he said, "We ask the customer for his name, address, phone number 
and driver's license. In the meantime, we always keep an eye on what type of 
car they came in. If they came in two (but not a husband and wife), we don't 
take both of them" on a test drive. 
</P>
<P>
At Porsche Audi of Downtown L.A., genuine interest is determined by having the 
"buyer" sit down and fill out an application. As that is going on, Anton said, 
"I'll call the phone number he gave us to make sure it's for real. If it's 
disconnected, or it's a motel or something, we'll tell the guy we're not going 
to take him on a test drive." 
</P>
<P>
"If anything happens during a demo ride," he added, "we always tell the 
salesperson to just give them the car." Insurance will cover it. 
</P>
<P>
At Toyota of Marina del Rey, sales manager Gary Primo was making notes for the 
morning meeting of his sales staff, which gives about 1,000 test drives every 
month. He intended to remind them that failure to photocopy a customer's 
driver's license before a demo drive will result in termination of employment, 
no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the last seven years, he said, before the mandatory driver's license 
rule was in effect there, the dealership had cars stolen at gunpoint, but "I 
haven't had a problem in three years." 
</P>
<P>
With a driver's license with a picture, he said, "You know if it's the person 
you've greeted, you don't have anything to worry about . . . or as much, I 
should say." 
</P>
<P>
Primo added that his sales personnel "use their own judgment in many cases" 
beyond the required license. For instance, Primo said, a red caution flag goes 
up "when someone walks in" rather than driving in. 
</P>
<P>
He laughed and said: "We had a guy in last night who told us he was the CEO of 
some company. When he left, he went out and sat down and waited for the bus." 
</P>
<P>
Toyota of Marina del Rey has a cardinal rule, he said: "When you exit the car, 
the keys go with you. We have had cars stolen off the lot where the keys were 
left in them." If, during a test drive, a salesperson gets out to switch seats 
with the customer, he takes the keys with him. 
</P>
<P>
Primo thought about the Charles Washington case again, and about his sales 
meeting. "I want to scare my salespeople," he said. "I really do, for their own 
good and the good of the business." 
</P>
<P>
"When you're marketing an $80,000 car, as compared to a $10,000 car, there are 
some differences" in policy in dealing with customers, said a Mercedes-Benz 
sales manager who asked that neither he nor his dealership be named. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, for example, that repeat buyers or friends of the dealer are not 
required to produce a driver's license for photocopying before taking off for a 
test spin in a new Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
A prospective customer walking cold into a Mercedes dealership, he added, is 
screened to determine "affordability" of a Mercedes, including information on 
whether he or she "has had any previous highline cars in the past. You don't 
just jump into the car and take a demo ride." 
</P>
<P>
And good-sense precautions are taken. "If we have three people coming in (to 
look) and none of them are related, we would put just one in the car," he said. 
With just one salesperson -- so as not to appear "overbearing to our 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
And when it comes time to write the check for that 560SL? "We only accept 
certified funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, at Felix Chevrolet, located in a high-crime area near the 
Coliseum, customers must show a valid driver's license and fill out a check-in 
slip giving their insurance information before being taken for a demo ride. 
</P>
<P>
"The thief's not going to be carrying I.D. on him," reasoned manager John 
Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
For a ride in a no-frills used Chevy, that's all that's required, Sanchez said, 
but "if it's an exotic or new car or limited-production car, then we're going 
to be a little more discriminating." 
</P>
<P>
Has he had incidents at Felix? "Oh, sure," he said. "Everybody has." But he has 
never had a salesperson disappear while giving a demo ride. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Koerner, sales manager at Pioneer Hyundai in North Hollywood and a 15-year 
veteran of the car-selling business, was recalling a story from his days 
selling Toyotas: 
</P>
<P>
A customer was test-driving a Supra, with the salesman in the passenger seat. 
"As they drove, the guy said: 'Man, this car doesn't have the get-up and go. 
It's not like my Porsche.' At that point, the salesperson suggested, 'Here, 
I'll show you how to drive it.' He gets out (to change seats) and the guy 
drives off. Pretty soon we get a phone call: 'You guys missing a Supra? It's 
gonna cost you $300 to get it back.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Koerner, an arrangement was made for a rendezvous at a 7-Eleven 
store where police, alerted by the Toyota agency, were waiting for the thief. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Hyundai follows standard precautions. Beyond that, Koerner said, it's a 
judgment call by the salesperson, which is tricky because "you're schooling 
these people not to judge a book by its cover." 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai has not had a big problem, Koerner said. "When you're dealing with a 
product like ours, an inexpensive car, an affordable car, you're not going to 
get that . . . A fellow's going to steal a car, he's going to steal a car. If I 
was going to steal a car, I wouldn't steal a Hyundai. I'd steal a Mercedes." 
</P>
<P>
Arman Kepekchian, the lot man at Barish Chrysler-Plymouth, was thinking about 
Monday night, the last time he saw Charles Washington. He recalled that when 
Washington had not returned with his customer by 8, closing time, he had locked 
the doors and left lights on in one office, reasoning, "Sometimes he sits down 
late and talks with customers." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning Washington's personal car still sat on the lot and his 
briefcase was still in his office. About 11 a.m., the office manager called his 
residence. He had not been home. 
</P>
<P>
Kepekchian was still pondering the situation. "No car, no salesman, nobody."

IN THE VEST INTEREST OF WHIMSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playing hooky in Laguna Beach recently, designer Holly Sharp invested heavily 
in beads, jewels and trinkets. Wanting to do "something fun with them," she 
sewed "all $200 worth onto a vest. When I wore it to work the next day, 
everybody went crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Not long after, she wore it to her Los Angeles showroom where buyers 
unexpectedly clamored for more. The designer has obliged with one-of-a-kind, 
hand-decorated pieces that retail for approximately $100 -- some decorated with 
buttons, charms, coins, faux gems, watch chains and fishing tackle. (They're 
currently at select Bullock's stores.) 
</P>
<P>
Ranging from beaded to bare-bones, from unisex to downright sexy, from baroque 
to very British, the vest has become the latest fashion darling, rated an 
accessory as important as a belt, as decorative as jewelry. In fact, Sharp says 
she wears one every day, be it with jeans or something dressier, "for a splash 
of color or a layer of texture." 
</P>
<P>
Proving vests can be an inexpensive way to take the blah out of a basic 
wardrobe, John Eshaya, store manager for Fred Segal on Melrose Avenue, recently 
created a collection of $42 vests for the store. He bought vintage styles from 
thrift shops and redecorated them with velvet bows, flowered fabrics or 
milagros (small Mexican "miracle" charms). 
</P>
<P>
All vests at Fred Segal are unisex and multifaceted, says Eshaya, who has seen 
schoolgirls buying flower and vegetable designs by Paul Smith. The same styles 
look good under leather jackets. And they work wonders for Eshaya's black-tie 
wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite look for Linda Grosfeld, owner of the Antony Moorcroft clothing 
company in Los Angeles, is a vest teamed with a shirt and a pair of sheer 
chiffon pants. She wears the shirt out and belted, for a neo-hippie look. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the whole '60s era was going to come back," says Grosfeld, explaining 
why she has been collecting vests for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
One favorite in her collection is a red, raw-silk style by Los Angeles designer 
Bryan Emerson, decorated with embroidery and gold coins, that she found at 
Shauna Stein in the Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>
Another prize possession has a tapestry front with lapels and a sheer-chiffon 
back. She combines this one with tapestry pants, a white, full-sleeved shirt 
and an ascot tied at the neck. 
</P>
<P>
Antony Moorcroft offers mixed-pattern vests for spring, in combinations of 
polka dots, stripes and florals ($98 to $110 at Ice in Beverly Center). But 
Grosfeld suggests that women new to vests might want to play it safe, starting 
out with a solid color (black, white or khaki), which they can decorate to 
their hearts' content with pins. 
</P>
<P>
While fashion fanatics claim the current revival does not include the 
androgynous image inspired by the film "Annie Hall," Grosfeld disagrees: "I 
think anything pertaining to a vest is in." 
</P>
<P>
"Layering is a big part of the look," points out Ann Stordahl, vice president 
and merchandise manager for Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin. Even so, the 
couture crowd likes to wear vests instead of blouses under jackets. And the 
trendies are wearing theirs with nothing over and almost nothing under. (If a 
vest has large armholes, Stordahl suggests a tank top or a body suit can give 
essential coverage and still preserve the bare, sleeveless look.) 
</P>
<P>
Fall will bring out knit versions, as well as fur vests, which are always a big 
item in California, according to Stordahl. "You see them in Palm Springs. It's 
a casual look; a gabardine pant, a sweater and a little mink vest." 
</P>
<P>
Men's vests are part of the Benetton look for women, says the company's U.S. 
fashion director Patrizia Spinelli. "It's something you can lend to your 
boyfriend or borrow from him. If you wear it loose and informal, it doesn't 
matter if it's too big." 
</P>
<P>
Her personal preference is a vest worn loosely over a white T-shirt, or for a 
dressier look, over a camisole that has a little lace in front. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate women who want to lighten up their office attire might consider what 
Patty Fox, fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue, practices and preaches. Her 
own wardrobe includes one outfit with a dressy baroque-inspired vest, an 
oversize damask shirt and a short black skirt. She wears the shirt out, wraps 
it with a chain belt and adds a cluster of pins to one lapel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not to be taken seriously, like a three-piece vested suit," she says. 
"It's done for wit." 
</P>
<P>
At Robinson's, Wesley Clay, vice president of fashion merchandising, sees the 
Southwestern look continuing with "a wonderful vest, a white shirt and a long, 
sweeping skirt -- preferably in chambray." 
</P>
<P>
For more exotic dressing, Clay likes a mix of ethnic prints, starting with the 
vest, moving on to the ikat- or batik-dyed T-shirt and ending with a long, 
sarong-front skirt: "It's a tribal statement for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
One of Clay's favorite outfits for working women this summer is a vest, a white 
blouse with a portrait collar and a long, fluid skirt. For fall, he sees the 
arrival of "the British countryside movement," in which the vest teams up with 
a lace-collar blouse and jodhpur-style pants. 
</P>
<P>
All told, this is one fashion movement that lends itself to couture tastes on a 
thrift-shop budget. Segal's Eshaya suggests how it can be done: "Get a funky 
old vest, put charms all over it or add tons of buttons." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, designer Sharp recommends charms and buttons, along with 
anything from the garage.

The Players Club, a male bastion of the acting profession for 100 years, will 
induct its first women members Sunday at a star-studded centennial celebration 
at the Shubert Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Hayes, first lady of the American theater, will head a list of 19 women 
who are expected to be on stage for the induction ceremony, scheduled to 
coincide with William Shakespeare's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, 88, will receive the Players' first Edwin Booth Award for lifetime 
achievement in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The Players, founded by Booth, voted last year to admit women in response to a 
U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down club discrimination against women. 
Among those invited to join were Gwen Verdon, Lauren Bacall, Dina Merrill, Mary 
Tyler Moore, Sylvia Sidney, Beverly Sills, Betty Comden, Carol Burnett and Uta 
Hagen.

JOHN DENVER SURVIVES AIR CRASH

<P>
John Denver's 1931 Waco biplane, caught by a gust of wind, crashed on landing 
at the Holbrook Airport, but the singer walked away unhurt, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Denver's vintage airplane sustained "extensive damage" in the crash Thursday, 
but the entertainer did not need medical treatment, Police Chief Lester James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Denver was alone in the plane and trying to land at Holbrook Airport for 
refueling on a flight from Carefree, Ariz., to Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
"When he attempted to set down, a gust of wind apparently blowing from the west 
caught the aircraft," James said. "It bounced a couple of times. His indication 
to us was that he tried to fly out of it, but the engine stalled and the 
aircraft went down. It either cart-wheeled or flipped over."

NASA GIVES SHUTTLE JOB TO LOCKHEED;

$1.1-BILLION CONTRACT CALLS FOR BUILDING OF NEW ROCKET BOOSTERS

Lockheed Missile Systems Division won contracts worth more than $1 billion to 
build new space shuttle solid rocket boosters at an abandoned nuclear power 
plant in Mississippi, NASA announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost for the controversial seven-year project, which calls for 
design, development and testing of the new advanced solid rocket motor, or 
ASRM, along with construction of new manufacturing facilities, was estimated by 
Lockheed of Sunnyvale, Calif., to be more than $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The precise values of both contracts will be determined in negotiations 
between NASA and Lockheed," The National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The booster contract includes an option for production of up to 44 booster sets 
with the new motors in time for first flight in 1994. The Lockheed boosters 
will be phased in over the next three years, replacing the current rockets 
built by Morton Thiokol Inc. of Brigham City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The new boosters will be built at the Tennessee Valley Authority's vacant 
nuclear power plant in Tishomingo County, Miss. A total of 1,400 people are 
expected to be employed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that this important step has been taken in the process for the

Mississippi Republicans, said in a statement issued in Washington.

Aerojet Is Subcontractor 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's principal subcontractor for the project will be Aerojet Solid 
Propulsion Co. of Sacramento. Lockheed won the contract over Hercules Inc. of 
Magna, Utah, and Atlantic Research Corp. of Gainesville, Va., which submitted a 
proposal under the name Hercules-Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Lockheed team include Babcox and Wilcox of Barberton, 
Ohio, Morton Thiokol, Lockheed Austin Division of Austin, Tex., and Rust 
International of Birmingham, Ala., which will be facilities contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The advanced solid rocket motor was proposed after the Jan. 28, 1986, 
Challenger disaster that killed seven astronauts. A faulty O-ring seal in the 
ship's right-side booster was blamed for the shuttle's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The boosters, built by Morton Thiokol, were redesigned after the disaster to 
make them less susceptible to failure. NASA began exploring alternate designs 
about the same time, and the result was the ASRM program. 
</P>
<P>
The project faces funding problems and questions in Congress, however, because 
of an internal NASA safety board report that challenged the need for a more 
powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say proceeding with the project implies that the current boosters, 
redesigned at a cost of more than $600 million, are unsafe. In addition, they 
say, conservative post-Challenger flight rules limit how much weight a shuttle 
can carry into orbit, making the excess performance of the ASRM unnecessary.

The White House denounced the slaying of a U.S. Army colonel in the Philippines 
today as a "terrible and heinous act" that had the appearance of a planned 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense officials said Col. James Rowe, 51, was a highly decorated officer 
who was captured during the Vietnam War and escaped after five years in enemy 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States will work closely 
with the Philippine government to track down the killers of Rowe, a member of a 
U.S. military advisory team, and he reiterated American support for the 
government of President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
"President Aquino has our total support in her efforts to maintain national 
unity, revitalize democracy and counter the communist insurgency," Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the killing of Rowe, who was ambushed while driving to work in Manila 
this morning, "certainly had the earmarks of an intentional attack." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the United States does not know who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
A Philippine military spokesman blamed the attack on communist guerrillas of 
the New People's Army, which has been waging a 20-year insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, who was on his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Advisers Group, was 
shot in the head and died on his way to the hospital after his car was ambushed 
on a Manila street by hooded gunmen firing automatic weapons. His Filipino 
driver was also hit and was recovering in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense officials said Rowe was riding in an armored embassy sedan, but 
the bullet that killed him "entered through a non-hardened portion of the 
vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe was one of only 34 Americans to escape his captors during the Vietnam War. 
He was captured Oct. 29, 1963, and escaped and returned to U.S. control on Dec. 
31, 1968.

U.S. SPY RINGS FOUND, IRAN CLAIMS;

WHITE HOUSE DENIES KNOWING OF AGENTS IN SENSITIVE PLACES

Iran's Parliament Speaker said today that the government has uncovered pro-U.S. 
spy rings that included agents in "sensitive places" and senior naval officers 
who betrayed Iranian warship movements. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Shia Muslim worshipers chanted "American spies must be executed!" 
after they listened to Hashemi Rafsanjani's allegations during a sermon at 
Tehran University. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, reporting on the Speaker's 
statements, said Rafsanjani alleged that the rings were involved in plots to 
overthrow the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fundamentalist government and had 
been operating as far back as the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Information on Allegations 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he had no information on the 
allegations. "My information is we don't really know what they're talking 
about. They make similar claims every once in a while about American spies when 
they need a little attention." 
</P>
<P>
But there is little doubt U.S. intelligence agencies have operatives in Iran, 
given the Islamic Republic's deep hostility toward "the Great Satan." 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's statements appeared designed to stir up anti-Western sentiment to 
deflect attention from political problems at home. 
</P>
<P>
He said the agents included "big American spies" who were being interrogated, 
and he said the arrests had exposed the entire CIA operations in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Some spies were Iranian navy personnel who transmitted intelligence on Iranian 
deployments to the U.S. Navy "when they were fighting us in the Persian Gulf," 
Rafsanjani said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sophisticated Equipment' 
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian ship Iran Ajr, shot up and boarded by U.S. forces in the 
gulf on Sept. 21, 1987, while it was planting mines, was "betrayed by these 
very people." 
</P>
<P>
Iranian security agents seized "sophisticated equipment," including radio 
transmitters, code books and even invisible ink used "to send messages to the 
CIA," he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani did not say how many people had been arrested because "the Americans 
should not know how many of them have been trapped. There are too many." He 
also did not identify any of the accused naval officers. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said "God's decree will be carried out" and the alleged spies would 
be punished.

NORTH JURY DELIBERATING -- 'GUILTY,' ALTERNATE DECLARES

Oliver L. North's jury began debating his guilt or innocence in a tightly 
guarded room today, as an alternate juror who heard all the testimony said she 
would have voted to convict him on some of the 12 charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. North . . . wasn't made to do what he did," said Horasina McKie, one of 
five alternates dismissed when the case went to the jury. "He had a choice in 
it. He had a choice to either say, 'No, I don't want to do this,' or 'Yes sir, 
I will do this,' even as it went along and he knew it was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
North is charged with withholding information from Congress, lying to Atty. 
Gen. Edwin Meese III about his activities in the Iran-Contra affair, destroying 
and altering documents, misusing money and accepting an illegal gratuity. 
</P>
<P>
McKie told CBS News she had not discussed the case with other jurors and did 
not know how they might vote. 
</P>
<P>
The foreman is a 34-year-old hospital clerk, Denise Anderson, who said during 
pretrial questioning that she does not like news and that the extensive 
television coverage given North's testimony during the 1987 congressional 
hearings "made me mad. . . . I did not look at it at all."

BARGE CARRYING WASTE FOR EXXON RUPTURES ON RIVER IN LOUISIANA

A barge carrying waste material for the Exxon Chemical Co. ruptured as it was 
being unloaded today, spilling up to 400,000 gallons of water mixed with lesser 
amounts of alcohol and oil into the Grand River, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
The barge owned by Palmer Barge Co. was carrying the waste for the subsidiary 
of Exxon Corp. when a tank in the barge buckled, releasing "300,000 to 400,000 
gallons of combustible material," said Lt. Ronnie Jones of the state police. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the company immediately placed booms in the river to contain the 
spill and sent cleanup crews from New Orleans to the swampy site, about 70 
miles west of the city. "The material is about 90% water, so it's going to 
dissipate," he said. "We believe the majority has been contained."

President Bush invited a divergent group of economists and business leaders for 
"a freewheeling and open discussion of the economy" this weekend at Camp David, 
Md., a White House spokesman said today. 
</P>

Marlin Fitzwater said the guests would include former Federal Reserve Chairman 
Paul A. Volcker, now a New York investment consultant and professor at 
Princeton University, IBM chief John Akers and Paul O'Neill, the chairman of 
Alcoa.

<P>
"It's another one of these kinds of discussions the President likes to have 
with authorities and experts outside of the government to discuss all kinds of 
issues without worrying about policy decisions," Fitzwater said.

MARKET RESUMES ITS RALLY; OPTIMISM SPURS DOW 32.08

<P>
The stock market rallied today, resuming the month-long advance that has 
carried it to new highs since the crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 32.08 to 2,409.46, closing above 
2,400 for the first time since it stood at 2,412.70 on Oct. 14, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the week the average rose 72.40 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 936 up, 517 down and 478 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 187.31 million shares, against 175.97 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained 1.58 to 172.88. 
</P>
<P>
The market suffered a temporary setback Thursday when the West German central 
bank announced unexpected increases in its official interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
That raised fears of downward pressure on the dollar and of possible further 
credit-tightening in this country. 
</P>
<P>
By today, however, analysts said investors seemed to be taking the view that 
the Federal Reserve would wait a while longer to gauge the effects of the 
restrictive moves it has made over the past year or so. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, observers noted, the possibility remained open in many minds that 
interest rates are close to or at a peak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonds Bounce Back 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices bounced back in early trading today, reflecting relief that major 
central banks took no immediate steps to match Thursday's interest rate hikes 
in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 5/16 point, or nearly $3 per 
$1,000 face amount, at midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction 
from its price, slipped to 8.98% from 9.01% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell sharply Thursday after the West German central bank 
unexpectedly raised two of its key lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
The move suggested to some traders that world interest rates may be headed 
higher, a development that would depress bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
But Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, said 
traders were reassured by today's statement from Tatsuo Murayama, Japan's 
finance minister, that he sees no reason for an increase in rates there. 
</P>
<P>
"The comments served to calm the market," Sohn said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secondary Market 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
governments rose 5/32 point, intermediate maturities rose 7/32 point and 
long-term issues were up as much as 11/32 point, according to the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials edged up. Moody's investment grade corporate 
bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds 
with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.31 to 301.71.

The government warned Britain's tabloid newspapers today to "clean up their 
act" or face laws to curb sensationalist journalism that has led to huge libel 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
Home Office Minister Timothy Renton, responding to public anger over the way 
tabloid newspapers fight their circulation wars, announced the setting up of an 
independent review of press behavior. 
</P>
<P>
He told Parliament that the investigation will be completed within a year and 
will be followed by legislation if press behavior does not improve. "Editors 
and publishers of the national press are on probation in this country," Renton 
said. "They have a year or two to clean up their act." 
</P>
<P>
The review was disclosed as government supporters ensured the defeat of an 
attempt by opposition Labor Party legislator Tony Worthington to provide 
victims of unfair newspaper reports with a legal right of reply. 
</P>
<P>
The government, which has had its own quarrels with the press, torpedoed 
Worthington's proposals only because it considered them unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thatcher Accused 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges in Parliament coincided with a meeting in London of the 
International Press Institute to discuss accusations by some journalists that 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has eroded press and broadcasting freedom in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure for reform of the press has resulted from its growing intrusions into 
the private lives of the famous, sexual smears and blatant invention of 
headline stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun paid a record $1.7 million in libel damages to rock star Elton John 
last December after admitting that stories about him were untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington's bill would have created a press commission with power to enforce 
a right of reply in newspapers found guilty of inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative legislator Sir Nicholas Bonsor, who supported him, said: "The 
amount of inaccurate rubbish one reads in the newspapers is so appalling that 
it must be right that someone should be able to rebut it." 
</P>
<P>
The bill was opposed by all newspapers, some of which complained that the 
serious press would be penalized for the sins of the tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
Editors of newspapers in several Western European countries attended the press 
seminar, at which sharp criticism was voiced both of the press and of 
increasing limits imposed on journalists by the British government and courts. 
</P>
<P>
These include efforts to ban discussion of security issues and the prohibition 
of broadcasts of live interviews with Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of 
the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland.

SOVIET WAGES FAR OUTSTRIP PRODUCTIVITY

Soviet wages grew more than twice as fast as productivity in the first quarter 
of 1989, further aggravating unsatisfied domestic demand for consumer goods, 
official data released today showed. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Belov, first deputy chairman of the state statistics committee 
Goskomstat, speaking at a news conference, also reported statistics showing a 
slowdown in industrial production, a decline in exports and an increase in 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
The figures appeared to confirm that the Kremlin's liberalizing economic 
reforms, criticized by some Soviet economists as half-hearted, have been unable 
to bring a quick solution to the country's mounting economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Imbalance 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, at least, the greater freedom the reforms have given state 
enterprises to set wage levels for their workers has apparently exacerbated the 
economic imbalance, which Belov described as "a very alarming phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
Belov said average wages grew at an annualized rate of 9.4% in the first three 
months of 1989, while productivity grew by 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet economy is going through a complicated, sometimes contradictory 
process," Belov said, although he maintained that the main tendency was 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to control the growth of money incomes so it is in line with 
the growth of productivity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modify Taxation 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Belov said, plans were being made to introduce a coefficient 
tying wage increases to productivity increases at state enterprises, where the 
majority of citizens work. 
</P>
<P>
He said there were also plans to modify taxation, which would also help curb 
disposable income of the 1.7 million people -- out of a total work force of 120 
million -- who are employed in the booming cooperative sector. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in wages -- which at an average $377 per month are still extremely low 
by the standards of other industrialized countries -- has further exacerbated 
the imbalance between supply and demand in the economy.

Lech Walesa, leader of Solidarity and champion of Poland's new political 
course, told Italian political leaders today that his country needs investment, 
rather than aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland has all the figures to be part of of Europe, but it needs investments, 
more than aid -- investments to create companies and a market," the Polish 
labor leader told Premier Ciriaco De Mita. 
</P>
<P>
In a 35-minute meeting with the premier, Walesa said Solidarity intends to 
fight economic centralism and work for political, economic and social 
pluralism. Foreign investment would play a key role in helping Poles reach 
those goals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa also drummed home his plea for investments in talks today with President 
Francesco Cossiga, Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, Socialist Party leader 
Bettino Craxi and Rome Mayor Pietro Giubilo.

to a hostile joint takeover bid for the electronics group Plessey by General 
Electric Co. of Britain and Siemens AG of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Anglo-German bid, announced last November, would create one of Europe's 
biggest electronics groups, capable of competing with the industry's giants in 
North America and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Plessey Co. PLC fought hard against the unwanted $2.9-billion bid, launching 
several unsuccessful court attempts to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission approved the bid "provided appropriate 
undertakings are given . . . to deal with aspects of the merger which might 
otherwise be expected to operate against the public interest." Plessey and GEC 
are both major defense contractors in Britain and the Ministry of Defense was 
earlier reported to have raised objections to the bid.

The District Attorney's Office has declined to charge a Fresno State football 
player with rape on grounds of insufficient evidence that force was used. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive lineman Terry Cook was arrested after a 22-year-old woman said he and 
two other men gang raped her on April 7. But an investigation has turned up 
"insufficient evidence of force and fear to warrant filing the case," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Gary Hoff said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After Cook's arrest, he and a player who was named by the woman but not 
arrested were suspended from the football team. Coach Jim Sweeney said he has 
not decided whether to reinstate them. "I'm sickened by the event," Sweeney 
said.

The Iowa House voted 51 to 47 to approve legalized river boat gambling, 
rejecting claims that it is inviting organized crime to the nation's heartland. 
The measure now goes to Gov. Terry E. Branstad, who has said he will approve 
it. Under the bill, the state's Racing Commission would issue gambling licenses 
for boats on rivers and streams, and would determine the number. The bill 
legalizes small stakes gambling, with a $5 limit per bet and a $200 nightly 
loss limit.

O.C. SHIP VICTIM: 'NOT A WASTE; HE DID US PROUD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Geoffrey Scott Schelin was a young man without a purpose when he graduated from 
Estancia High School in Costa Mesa in 1986, someone who spent too many hours at 
the beach because he had few ideas of what to do with his life, according to 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, he joined the Navy, and it was a decision that transformed 
him, according to his parents, Dale and Darleen Schelin. 
</P>
<P>
"He grew light years as far as maturity," said his mother from the couple's 
apartment in El Toro. "It just seemed that as he learned discipline from the 
Navy, and became stronger in the things that he was determined to do, our 
friendship really developed." 
</P>
<P>
Darleen Schelin talked to her son on the telephone a week ago Thursday, as they 
tried to work out plans for his visit home in 2 weeks. But instead of driving 
home from Norfolk, where he was stationed, as he had planned, Geoffrey Schelin 
will be coming home in a flag-draped coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Schelin, a petty officer 3rd class on the battleship Iowa, was one of 47 
sailors killed Wednesday when an explosion tore through a gun turret aboard the 
vessel during exercises in the Atlantic Ocean off Puerto Rico. His family said 
his job was to supervise the loading of gunpowder on the gun deck. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Schelin's parents, seven of his brothers and sisters, their spouses 
and many of his 21 nieces and nephews gathered at the parents' apartment 
Thursday to share the grief. Only a sister in Utah who is about to give birth 
could not be with them, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very supportive of each other," Darleen Schelin said. "When one of 
us was really down today, we've had a lot of giving and thoughts of love and 
support, stories about Jeff, and 'remember when. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
But there was no anger about the disaster that took their youngest son. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff chose to be in the Navy; he chose his assignment," said David Schelin, 
37, the oldest of the siblings. 
</P>
<P>
"He was given a choice of assignments, and he chose to be on the Iowa," he 
said. "He wanted to be on a battleship and he wanted to be in a turret. He 
wanted to be where the best were." 
</P>
<P>
Schelin's family, who belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, say they were thrilled at the way the youngest child seemed to be 
flourishing in the military. 
</P>
<P>
In January, he was promoted to petty officer 3rd class. A few weeks ago, he 
sent his parents a copy of a letter of commendation he had received from his 
superiors saying that his work on the aircraft carrier Coral Sea during its 
Mediterranean deployment ending March, 1988, "established a standard of 
excellence." 
</P>
<P>
Schelin's parents heard about the explosion Wednesday morning from a friend who 
had heard a news report. Hours of anguish were to follow. About 5 a.m. 
Thursday, they said, four naval officers knocked on their door and said their 
son "was missing and presumed dead." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, they returned to say that their son was definitely among the 
dead. Pieces of Geoffrey's clothing and a badge with his name were found in the 
aftermath of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just all such a waste," his mother said, bursting into tears Thursday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a waste," another son, Daryl, 36, said, consoling her. "He did us 
proud. He did you proud." 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Schelin joined the crew of the battleship Iowa in January, just after 
his promotion, David Schelin said. He told his family that his superiors told 
the crew that there were too many petty officers on the Coral Sea and asked for 
volunteers to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was offered the option of 3 or 4 assignments, including the Iowa, and he 
took that immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey had many friends in high school, David Schelin said. He also had a 
girlfriend in Pennsylvania, whom the family has never met. 
</P>
<P>
"Her father called when he heard to confirm with us that Jeff was among the 
dead, and then he drove to her school to tell her, because he didn't want her 
to learn from the media," David Schelin said. "Then she called us. Obviously, 
she was very consoling but distraught." 
</P>
<P>
The television set has been on almost continually at the Schelin home since the 
family heard of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"When they show the caskets . . . it makes it more difficult," David Schelin 
said. "But we know he was doing a service for himself and for his country and 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has offered to fly the parents to Norfolk, Va., for Monday afternoon 
memorial services. 
</P>
<P>
"When they return, we're planning a service here," David Schelin said. "We had 
the option of having him buried at one of the national cemeteries. But we think 
he would want to be buried here at home. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother spent a lot of his young life on the beach, but he played football 
and baseball too," he continued. "He had a lot of friends in high school, was 
very active with friends. He did a lot of beach things that young men do around 
here." 
</P>
<P>
David said his brother probably will be interred at Pacific View Memorial Park 
in Newport Beach. But the family does not know when they can bring Geoffrey 
Schelin home.

NO DECISION ON KELLERMAN AFTER 4-HOUR CLOSED SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the North Orange County Community College District emerged from a 
4-hour closed-door session over the fate of district Chancellor James S. 
Kellerman to say only that no decision was reached Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Otto Lacayo had said before the meeting that district officials 
hoped to make a public statement about the reasons for Kellerman's sudden 
suspension earlier this month. Lacayo said the board would seek legal advice 
from district counsel Spencer Covert during its closed-door session on Thursday 
night. After the meeting, however, Lacayo said Covert had advised all board 
members not to comment about the district's internal investigation or 
Kellerman's suspension as chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Lacayo declined to elaborate, saying only, "We took no action." 
</P>
<P>
He said the board will issue a statement to district employees this morning, 
but he declined to release the contents of that statement. However, it was 
described by one source as "innocuous . . . a fluff piece." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Chris Loumakis, who had called for a criminal investigation into 
allegations of misconduct by Kellerman, said after Thursday's session that the 
board had made "no change" in Kellerman's suspended status. 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman, 54, was placed on paid administrative leave from his $97,000-a-year 
job April 12 after an internal investigation substantiated allegations of 
misconduct, board members have said. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview earlier Thursday, Kellerman said, "I'm not yet 
making any comment." He said he did not know when he would comment and that he 
did not plan to attend the special board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade said Wednesday that his office had opened a 
preliminary inquiry into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
An internal investigation has focused on allegations that Kellerman misused 
district resources and sought personal favors from those who worked for him, 
according to board members. Among those charges are the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Kellerman allegedly "borrowed" from a fund used primarily for advance travel 
expenses, according to Loumakis. All expenditures from that account are 
supposed to be approved in advance by the board of trustees, but Loumakis said 
that such has apparently not been the case. A district spokeswoman denied that 
any unauthorized withdrawals or borrowing had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
District records show that Kellerman repaid one advance for two trips on April 
13, the day after his suspension. The check for $477 reimbursed the district 
for advances Kellerman received for two 1986 trips that were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
* Kellerman allegedly sought personal loans from top employees, according to 
Loumakis. The board has received reports that at least one employee supplied a 
loan "in the 5-figure range," Loumakis said. 
</P>
<P>
* The district was billed $3,120 for repairs for damage from an accident last 
year involving Kellerman's district-owned car. 
</P>
<P>
An examination of district travel records showed no record of a business trip 
by Kellerman on that date. If Kellerman was not on district business at the 
time of the accident, the district should not be liable for repair charges, 
Loumakis said. 
</P>
<P>
* The district was billed $2,000 for a computer that allegedly was installed in 
Kellerman's home. 
</P>
<P>
* Kellerman allegedly coerced district employees into hosting Tupperware-style 
home decorating parties given by Kellerman's wife, according to a source close 
to the investigation. One district official who was the hostess of such a party 
said she did so voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
The board also has investigated unspecified allegations against Unisys Corp., 
which has been involved in negotiations with Kellerman and other district 
executives over the purchase of $455,000 in computer equipment. A scheduled 
vote to seek bids on the computer system upgrade was postponed in February 
after allegations of misconduct involving Kellerman first were reported to the 
trustees by Lacayo and board member Nilane Lee. A Unisys spokesman declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman, a former vice chancellor for the district, was named chancellor in 
February, 1986. His contract with the district expires in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Berdette (Bert) Cofer, 61, was named interim chancellor after the board decided 
to place Kellerman on administrative leave. The district includes Fullerton 
College and Cypress College, and serves 31,000 students in credit courses.

ARRAIGNMENT PLOY IS CHARGED IN RAZO CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for Jose Luis Razo, the former Harvard University student who 
confessed to a string of armed robberies, charged Thursday that La Habra police 
officers delayed his arraignment in July of 1987 so that he would keep talking 
to authorities before he obtained a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"They intentionally delayed it to get him to speak," said John D. Barnett, 
Razo's court-appointed attorney, on the second day of pretrial motions in 
Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The motions are expected to continue through next week, with jury selection 
tentatively scheduled for May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, now 22, emerged from a modest La Habra neighborhood to become a standout 
athlete and student at Servite High School in Anaheim and a recognized youth 
leader in the community. He was recruited by dozens of universities before 
enrolling at Harvard in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confessed to Robberies 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, however, he confessed to police and local newspapers that he 
had committed more than a dozen holdups in Orange and Los Angeles counties -- 
along with one in Florida -- during breaks from school. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett is hoping that testimony during pretrial motions will persuade Superior 
Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer to quash some or all of Razo's confessions to 
police on the grounds that they were obtained through what he called 
"constitutionally deficient" means. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Barnett tried to establish that Razo's first court appearance 
after his arrest July 6 was delayed a day so that Costa Mesa and Whittier 
police could interview him before he was assigned a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra Police Officer Michael Moore testified that he filed a complaint 
against Razo in Municipal Court in Fullerton on July 8 and assumed that Razo 
would be arraigned that day. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's partner, Detective Robert Wyse, testified that he also believed that 
Razo would be arraigned that day, and he told other police agencies that they 
should interview him while he was talking and before he got an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
But at Razo's preliminary hearing in 1987, Costa Mesa Police Detective Edmund 
Zuorski testified that Wyse called him on July 8 and told him that Razo would 
be arraigned July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Razo was taken to court on July 8, but he was not arraigned. Instead, he was 
taken back to Orange County Jail, where he was interviewed that night by Santa 
Ana and Costa Mesa police. One of the 10 Orange County robberies with which he 
is charged occurred in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Wyse said in court Thursday that until recently, he believed that Razo was 
arraigned July 8. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Police Lied 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said the discrepancy shows that Wyse, and possibly Moore, are lying and 
that the confessions they obtained from Razo should be ruled invalid. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't be believed," Barnett said, adding that the discrepancy casts 
doubts on the officers' assertion that they obtained the confessions lawfully. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravi Mehta disputed Barnett's claim. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Wyse is lying," Mehta said. Of the discrepancy between Wyse's 
testimony Thursday and Zuorski's in 1987, Mehta said, "That's a clarification 
I'm going to have to get from Zuorski," who is scheduled to testify next week. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta said he had no idea why Razo did not appear in court on July 8 and get an 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened at the clerk's office, nobody has a reason for it," he said. "I 
know for a fact that, having heard the testimony and having spoken with the 
officers, they did not delay the arraignment."

MAN INDICTED ON DRUG POSSESSION CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old Huntington Park man was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury 
in San Diego on charges that he was carrying 545 pounds of cocaine when he was 
stopped this month at the San Onofre checkpoint south of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Santiago Moran-Pallan was arrested April 6 after Border Patrol agents 
found 248 kilogram packages of the drug in the trunk of the car he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, U.S. Atty. William Braniff said the street value of that 
much cocaine would be about $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
Moran-Pallan is accused of possessing the drug with an intent to distribute. If 
convicted, he faces a term of from 10 years to life in federal prison, Braniff 
said. Moran-Pallan could also be fined as much as $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Moran-Pallan is being held without bail in the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in San Diego.

A federal magistrate Thursday ordered the extradition of Michael Wayde Mohon to 
California to face charges of attempted murder in an attack on a reserve police 
officer from Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Bert W. Milling ordered Mohon, 43, held in federal custody 
until he is returned to California. No bail was set. 
</P>
<P>
Mohon, who waived a hearing on his transfer to California, was arrested in 
Eight Mile, Ala., on Wednesday by FBI agents on information provided by a woman 
who viewed a segment of the NBC television program titled "Unsolved Mysteries." 
Mohon has been charged with unlawful flight to avoid state prosecution, FBI 
spokesman Doug Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Mohon was wanted for the 1983 attempted murder of Kevin Arnold, a reserve 
Fountain Valley police officer, after an alleged burglary attempt in Huntington 
Beach, and for escape from the Orange County Jail in January, 1985, and from 
Phoenix authorities 2 weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Arrested along with Mohon was his wife, Sharon Rose Mohon, 34, Marshall said. 
She is in state custody on charges of aiding in her husband's escape and for 
parole violations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who had been in the Mobile area since January, 1988, were using the 
names Steve and Mary Bostwick when arrested, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Mohon, who had been working as a self-employed painter, was arrested as he was 
leaving an auto parts store. His wife was arrested as she sat in a car nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been living in a camper. 
</P>
<P>
Mohon had been under surveillance by the FBI since Wednesday morning, Marshall 
said. The name of the woman who identified Mohon while watching "Unsolved 
Mysteries" on April 12 is being withheld at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said a search of Mohon's camper by FBI agents uncovered a number of 
handguns.

DECISION NEAR ON WHETHER GIONIS WILL BE TRIED IN WAYNE ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers delivered closing arguments Thursday in a preliminary hearing to 
determine whether Pomona surgeon Thomas A. Gionis should be bound over for 
trial on charges he masterminded an attack on his former wife, Aissa Wayne, and 
her then-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Municipal Judge Susanne S. Shaw, who is presiding over the case, is 
expected to make a decision today after hearing renewed arguments from Gionis' 
lawyers that he be freed on bail in the event he is bound over for trial in 
Orange County Superior Court. Gionis, 35, whom authorities consider a flight 
risk, has remained in custody without bail since his arrest April 4. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing arguments, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans said that 
Gionis had sufficient motive to orchestrate the Oct. 3 attack against Wayne, 
33, and financier Roger W. Luby, 53, at Luby's gated Newport Beach estate. 
Gionis has denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis could have acted out of spite, Evans said, because he was angered by a 
protracted court battle over custody of the couple's daughter, Anastasia. The 
wealthy surgeon spent about $500,000 in legal fees to win custody of the 
2-year-old girl in February, according to court testimony. He has since lost 
custody to Wayne pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings against him. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis could also have acted because he was afraid he would otherwise lose the 
custody case, Evans said. Court testimony has shown that Gionis lost "10 to 20" 
of the 50 pretrial motions in his custody case, despite his attorneys' 
assertions they were confident of victory. Gionis made Anastasia's safety while 
in Wayne's custody an issue during the 2-month custody trial that began Nov. 
29. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Gionis has a wonderful motive to 'do' both of these people," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence also points overwhelmingly to the orthopedic surgeon, Evans argued. 
</P>
<P>
First, Gionis paid his private investigator $40,000 over a 2-week period just a 
month before the attack, Evans said. That amount was "100% more" than the 
$25,000 that Gionis had paid to investigator O. Daniel Gal of Beverly Hills 
during the previous 6 months, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Gionis provided Gal a floor plan of Wayne's Corona del Mar home, where 
court testimony has shown the attack was originally intended to take place. 
Although defense attorneys have argued the floor plan was provided only for 
routine surveillance of Wayne, Evans asked, "Why is Dr. Gionis giving floor 
plans unless they (hired thugs) are going inside the house?" 
</P>
<P>
Evans said that telephone calls between Gal and Gionis on the day of the 
attack, as well as between Gal and the two men he allegedly hired to carry it 
out, show that the surgeon was being kept informed every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The men Gal allegedly hired, Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, an unemployed apartment 
manager from Burbank, and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, a swimming pool cleaner 
from Simi Valley, remained in Orange County Jail on Thursday on charges of 
assault with a deadly weapon. Gal, 32, is in custody in Switzerland on criminal 
conspiracy charges and is being extradited back to Newport Beach. All three men 
have bonds of $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
In his arguments, F. Lee Bailey, lead attorney for Gionis, maintained that his 
client had nothing to gain by directing an attack on his ex-wife and everything 
to lose. Bailey said that Gionis' custody case was airtight and that he was 
confident of winning custody. Risking a criminal charge by the bungling of men 
who carried out the attack could only have jeopardized his chances of winning 
custody, Bailey said. The men bungled by not wearing masks and by lingering in 
Luby's "ritzy" neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no conceivable benefit to Dr. Gionis, no matter how you slice it," 
Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey suggested, instead, that Luby was the intended victim and that Gal acted 
alone or in concert with angered investors from a failed real estate deal that 
ultimately forced Luby to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wayne, Luby and Bouey all testified this week that the attack was 
directed against Wayne, not Luby, Bailey accused all three witnesses of 
"felonious" lies. Bailey pointed to discrepancies between statements the 
witnesses gave police, in which they all mention Luby as a possible target of 
the attack, and court testimony in which they all disavowed saying any such 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey suggested that the district attorney's office has gone so far as trying 
to help Wayne's custody case by having Bouey testify that, as a father of two 
young sons, he empathized with Wayne's desire to be with her child. 
</P>
<P>
"If you knock Dr. Tom out of circulation, you win the custody case," Bailey 
said. "That is exactly what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey said the phone calls prove only that Gionis communicated with his 
private investigator a lot. And he said the payments to Gal signified only that 
Gionis was settling accounts with the investigator toward the end of a 7-month 
surveillance of Wayne for the custody case. 
</P>
<P>
Of the state's case, Bailey summarized: "If you rap on a piece of wood, you'll 
find it hollow."

EX-NEO-NAZI LEADER BURNS OFF 'SYMBOLS OF HATE' 
</P>

Former neo-Nazi leader Gregory Withrow underwent successful surgery Thursday to 
remove two swastika tattoos between his shoulder blades after declaring: "I 
would rather have scars on my back than these symbols of hate." 
</P>
<P>
UC San Francisco Medical Center doctors said the 4-square-inch tattoos were 
burned off by laser beam and chemicals. Withrow left the hospital immediately 
after surgery and neither he nor his surgeon would comment, hospital 
spokeswoman Alice Trinkle said. 
</P>
<P>
Withrow said Wednesday that the swastikas were symbols of a life he has now 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"The surgery is the next step in my evolution away from the white supremacist 
movement," said Withrow, 27, who was a founder of the White Students Union and 
the Aryan Youth Movement as well as a member of the White Aryan Resistance, the 
Ku Klux Klan, the Skinheads, the American Nazi Party and other racist groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I get these tattoos off my back, I want nothing else to do with this 
stuff," Withrow said. "The further I get away from it, the better I feel. I 
know it is going to hurt, and I don't like pain at all, but I would rather have 
scars on my back than these symbols of hate." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had been raised by his father to support "Hitler, Nazism, racism, 
fascism," but started to sever connections with ultraright groups when he fell 
in love with a young woman named Sylvia. 
</P>
<P>
He does not know where she is now, but her name remains tattooed on his right 
biceps. 
</P>
<P>
"Until I met her, I never experienced the emotion of love," Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
His former comrades were not pleased with his new philosophic turn, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, he was attacked with a baseball bat and suffered a broken jaw 
and nose and a concussion. A month later, a gang of Skinheads nailed Withrow's 
hands to a board and slashed his throat with a razor. 
</P>
<P>
After barely surviving that attack, he said, he quit drinking and taking drugs 
and "laid low in the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
He added that there was a second message to young people in his story. Besides 
rejecting Nazi philosophy, "People should not get tattoos, especially stupid 
tattoos," he said.

Saddleback College appeared to be in control of its Orange Empire Conference 
baseball game against Rancho Santiago Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos had a two-run lead going into the eighth and had Todd Bush, their 
ace reliever, warming up. 
</P>
<P>
But Saddleback made three errors in the eighth inning and Rancho Santiago 
scored seven runs en route to an 11-6 victory at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback led, 6-4, going into the eighth, but Greg Martineau had a two-out 
double to score Clint Holt. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback then brought in Bush, who leads the conference with six saves and an 
earned-run average of 0.90 in 40 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bush walked pinch-hitter Mark Dion. Another pinch-hitter, George Saldana, then 
hit a slow roller between first and second that first baseman Brent Ferguson 
kicked, picked up, but threw into short left field trying to get Dion at 
second. 
</P>
<P>
The error allowed Martineau to score the tying run. Danny Ontiveros then 
singled up the middle to drive in Dion. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Jeff Walters' throw to third was wild, and Saldana tried for 
home as third baseman Derek Gingerich ran down the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Gingerich's throw to the plate sailed into the Rancho Santiago dugout, allowing 
Saldana and Ontiveros to score, giving Rancho Santiago a 9-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Reynolds then singled and stole second. As he was stealing third, 
Saddleback reliever Garth Viar threw a wild pitch to score Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad Colby singled, went to second on another wild pitch and scored on a 
single John McTaggart for Rancho Santiago's final run. 
</P>
<P>
The victory put the Dons (24-12 overall and 13-5 in conference play) a game 
ahead of second-place Orange Coast (25-9-1, 12-6), and Cypress (26-12, 12-6). 
There are six games left in the conference race. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Ramos hit a two-run home to give Rancho Santiago at 2-0 lead in the 
second, but Saddleback took a 3-2 lead in the third. 
</P>
<P>
With two on and no one out, Matt Dahlgren bunted back to pitcher Jack Bailey. 
Bailey tagged Dahlgren, but jammed the thumb on his glove hand. Ferguson 
followed with an RBI double, Tony Spaan had an RBI groundout, and Ted Savage 
added an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago scored in the third to tie it, 3-3, Saddleback scored in the 
fourth and Rancho Santiago scored in the fifth to tie it, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Saddleback took a 6-4 lead. Larry Maddox hit a ball off the 
left-center-field fence that bounded away from center fielder Ontiveros. Maddox 
raced all the way around for an inside-the-park home run. 
</P>
<P>
Walters followed with a double and scored on a single by Gingerich. 
</P>
<P>

SCOTT WANTS TO SET . . . AND KEEP SCHOOL RECORD AT THIS YEAR'S MEET

For about minute last spring Ron Scott thought he was a part of something 
special. Then it was taken away. 
</P>
<P>
During prelims of the Southern Section 4-A swim meet, Scott and three teammates 
broke the Foothill High School record in the 200-meter medley relay. However, 
the Knights' jubilation was cut short because they were disqualified by meet 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They waited until we'd celebrated for about a minute, then they told us," 
Scott said. "They said that two of our swimmers jumped early. We had set the 
school record and had the fastest time of the day and they take it away. It was 
a big disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
However, Scott refuses to dwell on it. Instead, he is looking forward to 
Saturday's Foothill Invitational and possibly another shot at the school 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The meet will feature 13 teams, almost all from Orange County. Capistrano 
Valley and Foothill should be the top contenders in the boys' competition, 
while Capistrano Valley, Foothill, Fountain Valley, Marina and San Marino are 
the top girls' teams. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' prelims will be today at Foothill, beginning at 3 p.m. The girls 
prelims will be Saturday morning and the boys' and girls' finals Saturday, 
beginning at noon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a good chance at winning the combined title," said Scott, a 
senior. "We both have strong boys' and girls' teams. And we also have a shot at 
the medley record." 
</P>
<P>
Last year at the Foothill meet, Scott won the 100 butterfly with a time of 
51.75 seconds, breaking Ken Wills' school record of 51.90 set in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
He later broke his own record, finishing first at the Southern Section 4-A meet 
with a time of 49.81. 
</P>
<P>
Now Scott wants the medley record. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the Knights' medley relay team swam a 1:37.6. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce Furness and Rod Strachan were on that team and they both made it to the 
Olympics," Scott said. "So it would be a great thing to break their record." 
</P>
<P>
Only Scott (butterfly) and Brian Costanza (freestyle) remain from last year's 
medley relay team, which swam a 1:36.0. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bainbridge (breaststroke) and Rob Reynolds (backstroke) graduated. 
Bainbridge has been replaced by Brett Cowdell and Reynolds by Andrew 
MacLaughlan. 
</P>
<P>
The new unit already has set one record this season, breaking the CIF relays' 
mark a month ago. However, it was 2.7 seconds off the school record. 
</P>
<P>
"That meet was held so early in the season that it was difficult to break the 
school record," Scott said. "We weren't ready. But our time was really good. It 
encouraged us. We know we can break the school record." 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Foothill Coach Tom DeLong expects the 500 freestyle 
to be the toughest and most exciting race of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans (El Dorado) is the far and away the favorite. She won the event 
last year, with considerable ease. However, the field also will also include 
Shannon Marcoux (Foothill) and Amy Shaw (Capistrano Valley), both Southern 
Section finalists last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be a fierce race," DeLong said. "The field is as strong as you'll 
have in the Southern Section final." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo will be the favorite in boys' and girls' competitions at the 18th 
annual Mission Viejo swim meet, Saturday morning at the Marguerite Recreation 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo is the favorite in both the boys' and girls' competition. 
However, the Diablos will be pushed by Mt. Carmel, Palm Springs and Loyola in 
the boys, while Mt. Carmel, Palm Springs challenge in the girls. 
</P>
<P>
The meet will feature 13 boys' and 12 girls' teams.

OIL LEAPS BY $2.04 ON REPORT OF NORTH SEA PIPE SHUTDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crude prices leaped more than $2 a barrel in frantic trading Thursday after 
news of a possible monthlong shutdown of a vital North Sea oil pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a platform explosion Tuesday that disrupted about a 
quarter of the North Sea's oil output, which provides valuable Brent light 
crude to the United States, Europe and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West Texas 
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, soared $2.04 to finish at 
$24.65 a barrel, the highest level in more than 3 years. The last time the 
near-month contract was higher was on Jan. 15, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Since the gas explosion Tuesday, crude prices have surged nearly 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Because gasoline prices have already increased in recent weeks in response to 
the Alaskan oil spill, the latest jump in crude prices may have only a minimal 
impact at the consumer level, unless the pipeline shutdown is prolonged. 
</P>
<P>
In New York Merc trading Thursday, the price of unleaded gasoline for May 
delivery rose 0.03 of a cent to 74.64 cents a gallon, while the May heating oil 
contract fell 1.04 cents to 52.29 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"With Brent being a major crude, it has people scared," said Peter Beutel, 
energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc. "It's possible there won't be any May 
deliveries." 
</P>
<P>
Beutel said that buyers anxious to take positions on the May contract before it 
expired on Thursday also drove prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
The frenzied buying was triggered by a comment from British Energy Minister 
Cecil Parkinson that the oil-field shutdown could last up to a month. Officials 
of Shell Exploration &amp; Production, which operates the damaged Cormorant 
Alpha platform and the pipeline, were inspecting the damage and had not issued 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The closure affects several major oil companies that pump oil through the 
station. Those include Exxon Corp., with about 85,000 barrels a day shut in; 
Amoco Corp., with 10,000, and Conoco Inc. with 24,000. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said factors that normally would have driven prices down during this 
period -- overproduction by OPEC and a softening in demand during the second 
quarter -- had been pushed to the background. 
</P>
<P>
But once North Sea operations return to normal and as the Alaskan spill fades 
from people's minds, prices could fall back below $20 a barrel, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Overextended' 
</P>
<P>
"The market is so overbought due to the psychological impact of these events 
that there's a lot of room for a fall in prices," said Ken Miller, an analyst 
with the petroleum consulting firm of Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is overextended and over-bought at this point. The fundamentals 
don't support the prices." 
</P>
<P>
Crude prices also have gotten support from a strengthening gasoline market 
where the perception is that supplies will be tight this summer. The light 
North Sea Brent is particularly valuable because it is more easily refined into 
gasoline than heavier oil. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent accidents, some market observers say the idea of a shortage 
of oil or gasoline is more expectation than reality. 
</P>
<P>
"The strength in prices has resulted from a fortuitous coincidence of a lot of 
factors," said William Veno, director of oil market analysis for Data Resources 
Inc.

Nichols Institute in San Juan Capistrano posted net income of $960,000 for the 
first quarter, a 15% increase from $833,000 reported a year earlier. The 1988 
figure includes a $210,000 gain from an accounting change. Revenue totaled 
$30.2 million, a 60% increase from $18.9 million for the comparable quarter 
last year. Albert L. Nichols, chairman and chief executive, said the record 
performance in the 1989 first quarter was attributable in part to acquisitions 
completed in the second half of 1988. Nichols Institute provides diagnostic and 
clinical testing, and manufactures medical diagnostic test kits.

Ron Lagomarsino didn't seem to think that the silver, five-pointed star in his 
left earlobe violated the dress code any more than his rumpled green shirt, 
faded jeans or scuffed, white high tops. 
</P>
<P>
Of medium height with curly brown hair and an unassuming manner, he sauntered 
past the large brass plate that read "Proper Attire Please" at the entrance to 
the sedate guest club of a businessman's hotel in Santa Ana without giving the 
words a glance. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got great coffee," he said, and headed straight for the serve-yourself 
urn set out by the bar one morning last week. 
</P>
<P>
Here to direct the world premiere of Beth Henley's "Abundance," which launches 
the California Play Festival tonight on the Mainstage at South Coast Repertory, 
Lagomarsino is regarded at the Costa Mesa theater as one of the nation's best 
young stage directors. "He's particularly good with new plays," said David 
Emmes, SCR's producing artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the 37-year-old San Francisco native is among the busiest, working 
not only with major playwrights on both coasts but also in television and soon, 
he hopes, in movies. 
</P>
<P>
A New Yorker for the past 15 years, Lagomarsino moved to Los Angeles in 
September under contract to direct regularly for the Emmy Award-winning 
"thirtysomething," now in its second season on ABC. He has helmed half a dozen 
episodes of the widely acclaimed baby-boomer series since it began airing last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still a novice at it," he said modestly, settling into a straight-backed 
chair. "It's quite different from stage, and there is so much I don't know. I 
guess they like stage directors because of their ability to work with actors." 
</P>
<P>
(Lagomarsino guessed right. When "thirtysomething" added a Peabody Award to its 
collection of prizes the day after this interview, the judges praised the 
series for, among other things, "exceptional performance.") 
</P>
<P>
His television work notwithstanding, Lagomarsino has hardly neglected the 
theater. In 1987 alone, he directed three world premieres in New York: Alfred 
Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Driving Miss Daisy" -- which he restaged for the 
national touring version now at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles -- 
Christopher Durang's "Laughing Wild" and Timothy Mason's "Only You." 
</P>
<P>
"What I look for in a play is if it seems new to me," he said. "I want to be 
surprised by it. I want the dialogue and the ideas to be fresh. That was 
unquestionably the case with Beth's play. People who have known her work in the 
past will recognize her voice in it. But there is something new." 
</P>
<P>
Henley, who won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for "Crimes of the Heart," has had her 
work mounted at SCR before. The theater produced her fourth play, "The 
Debutante Ball," in 1985. Lagomarsino also has worked at SCR before. He staged 
Larry Shue's "The Foreigner" on the Mainstage and Lisa Loomer's "Birds" on the 
Second Stage, both in 1986. But "Abundance" is the first time Henley and 
Lagomarsino have worked together. 
</P>
<P>
They had met only once, when Henley came to see "Laughing Wild." Although they 
knew and admired each other's work, Lagomarsino said, their collaboration might 
not have come about except for the fact that they share the same agent at 
William Morris. He sent Lagomarsino the script of "Abundance." 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, there were several theaters that wanted to produce it," the 
director recalled, ticking off Seattle Repertory, Steppenwolf in Chicago and 
the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. "But in terms of my TV schedule and 
everything else, the only slot that made sense was this one. Since I had a 
prior relationship at South Coast and Beth did too, it all came together." 
</P>
<P>
For SCR, it was not a moment too soon. Emmes and artistic director Martin 
Benson had scheduled Ellen McLaughlin's commissioned play, "Infinity's House," 
for CalFest but decided at the 11th hour that it wasn't ready for production. 
Desperate for a replacement, they landed Henley's play in December. 
</P>
<P>
Emmes said it was "pure chance" that both plays were written by women and that 
both take place in the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
"Abundance" tells the stories of Bess Johnson and Macon Hill, who arrive in the 
Wyoming Territory during the late 1860s as mail-order brides with visions of 
adventure dancing in their heads. They have, as Macon puts it, "Western fever." 
The play takes the temperature of that fever over a period of 25 years, 
chronicling the fate of their marriages and their reversals of fortune. It is 
Henley's sixth, full-length play and the first to be set outside the South. 
</P>
<P>
"What's exciting for me at South Coast," Lagomarsino said, "is to be able to 
prepare a play with a rehearsal period that doesn't have the pressure of 
opening smack in New York. And Beth has really done her work. There's been a 
lot of rewriting during this process in terms of line changes, but there have 
been no structural overhauls. None. This play was on firm ground when we 
started." 
</P>
<P>
Henley, who lives in Los Angeles, declined to be interviewed. Despite the 
quirky brashness of many of her characters in such plays as "The Wake of Jamie 
Foster" and "The Miss Firecracker Contest," the 36-year-old, Mississippi-born 
writer is said by SCR staffers to be extremely shy and prefers to let her work 
speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said he found Henley "very accessible," nonetheless. "She has a 
wonderful sense of humor and yet is very strong," he noted. "She knows what she 
wants -- to the word and to the punctuation." He said he believed Henley began 
writing "Abundance" several years ago but only managed to get down "a little 
bit" until last summer, when she wrote "90% of it in a sort of flurry." 
</P>
<P>
What drew him to the play was "the richness" of the scenes. "I'm just trying to 
bring out the juice in them," he said. "This is a play that could be done in 
all kinds of ways. You could go for the out-and-out comedy and play it very 
broadly. Or it could be very sinister and dark. The characters have a lot of 
secrets. They could be interpreted any number of ways by a different cast in a 
different production." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the play's episodic nature, Lagomarsino said, he focused on trying 
to make it "seamless." Thus, two mechanized turntables are used for the 17 
scene changes. "I didn't want stagehands running out every 5 minutes to change 
the sets," the director said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked out a complicated system that we hope will look very simple to an 
audience. The show should move cinematically. I don't like it when you're taken 
out of a play for great periods of time, or when you're made aware that you're 
sitting in a theater." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since casting began in February, the show has generated considerable 
interest from producers, who wonder if it will have a life beyond SCR. 
</P>
<P>
"People have already approached me," Lagomarsino said. "The theater community 
is hungry enough that potential producers will come flocking. That's partly 
because of Beth's reputation and partly because it's a new play." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he will begin pre-production on his next episode of 
"thirtysomething" right after "Abundance" opens. And while he won't get to 
direct Uhry's screen version of "Driving Miss Daisy" -- the producers didn't 
want to go with a first-time movie director, he said -- he hopes to do another 
Uhry movie. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say about it is that it has the working title 'Charm' and it's a 
beautiful job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abundance" by Beth Henley opens today and continues through May 25 at South 
Coast Repertory Theatre, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Curtain times: 8 
p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays; 7:30 p.m. Sundays. Matinees at 2:30 p.m. on 
Saturdays and Sundays. Tickets: $19 to $26. Information: (714) 957-4033.

THESE JOKERS WILL TAKE A FALL FOR SOME LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In its six years of existence, Vaudeville Nouveau has been doing its level, and 
frequently off-level, best to raise the much-maligned art form of 
rubber-chicken juggling to new heights -- 12, 13 feet to be precise. Wacka 
wacka wacka. 
</P>
<P>
There are wheelbarrows full of loopy humor in the threesome's retro-hip 
theatrical act. But there is an equal amount of mind-boggling, eye-popping, 
gravity-defying physical dexterity. The wildly kinetic show comes to Saddleback 
College in Mission Viejo tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In a world of entertainment that largely has abandoned the pie-in-the-face as 
the preferred method of comeuppance, it may seem hard to figure the relevance 
of showmen whose humor depends on old-fashioned pratfalls, baggy pants, 
fast-paced repartee, stunningly hideous eye wear and plaids so loud that 
neighboring airports are liable to complain. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, along with such theatrical-musical-comedy brethren as the Flying 
Karamazov Brothers, Vaudeville Nouveau has revived the manic energy of old-time 
variety shows and combined it with a performance art-like sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"In live theater, you can acknowledge the audience," Mark Sackett, 34, said by 
phone this week from his home in San Francisco. "You're right there with the 
audience and you can talk to them. And we do -- we talk directly to the people 
and improvise parts of the show. When someone coughs or yells back at us, 
that's not bad at all. We have fun with it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"For us, that's the point of live theater -- it's that real sense of walking on 
a tightrope, which I can say because I used to walk a tightrope." (Indeed, 
Sackett met his Vaudeville Nouveau partners Danny Mankin and Jeff Raz while all 
were working their respective ways through college as circus performers). 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason the Marx Brothers (performed in front of live audiences 
before filming), and the reason their movies work, is that when you play to an 
audience, you find out one-on-one what works," Sackett continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally when you are doing comedy on film, there's no feedback. You can work 
on a bit and work it out till you think it's perfect, but if it's not funny to 
the average viewer, it's not funny. The Marx Brothers did their material time 
after time after time until it was perfect, which is why they were exciting and 
as fresh as they were." 
</P>
<P>
These comedic descendants of the Marx Brothers, the Mack Sennett stable of 
funnymen and, further back, Italy's commedia dell'arte, play an average of 250 
dates a year at colleges, fairs, schools and senior centers. 
</P>
<P>
The act can be as short as a 20-minute variety show stint, or a full-evening 
production such as "Aesthetic Peril," slated for Saddleback, and "Savage 
Chicken," to be revived this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the name of the current show from a critic in San Francisco who was 
writing about something else, and at the end of the review he said, 'Miss this 
at your own aesthetic peril.' We thought that was a riot, so we took it," 
Sackett said. 
</P>
<P>
The group's shows evolve constantly, so this will be a slightly different 
version of "Aesthetic Peril" than the one Vaudeville Nouveau shared last year 
with a Leisure World audience that seemed alternately bewitched, bothered and 
bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things in the show that go right over kids' heads. There are some 
things that go right over (adults') heads. There are even some things that go 
right over our heads," said Sackett, and he wasn't just referring to the steady 
stream of jugglers' clubs, rings, butchers' knives and the obligatory rubber 
chickens kept airborne. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Vaudeville Nouveau has proven popular. Youngsters like the troupe 
even though it lacks the multimillion- dollar special effects and high-tech 
gadgetry that seem indispensable to most entertainment directed at children 
these days. Success with the small fry doesn't surprise Sackett: It was a 
theatrical production for children that convinced him that something like 
Vaudeville Nouveau would succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before we started Vaudeville Nouveau, Raz and I did a production of 'The 
Taming of the Shrew' in Oakland," he recalled. "It was a program of Shakespeare 
for inner-city kids. We had this assistant director who kept telling us that it 
wouldn't work, that the kids wouldn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
"But after the performance, three kids about 8 years old walked up to me -- I 
was playing Petruchio -- and one of the kids looked at me and said, 'Are you 
and that lady (Katharina) really married or is it just pretend?' 
</P>
<P>
"I explained that it was just part of the story, and then the kid asked, 'If 
you were just pretending to be married, did you marry her really for the money 
or did you really like her?' That choked me up because they got it. The 
physical action kept their interest, and helped the story make sense so it sunk 
in. At that point I knew the physical end of theater was on track, and shortly 
after that we decided to put Vaudeville Nouveau together. 
</P>
<P>
"Those kids will go see theater again. They will go see at least one play later 
in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaudeville Nouveau performs at 8 tonight in Saddleback College's McKinney 
Theatre, 28000 Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo. Tickets: $11, general; $9, 
seniors. Information: (714) 582-4656.

TICKET HIKES AT IRVINE MEADOWS WILL PAY FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The cost of a concert ticket at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre has gone up 50 
cents due to a new tax levied by the Irvine City Council to pay for police 
protection and traffic control at performances. 
</P>
<P>
The fee will raise an estimated $205,000 this year, according to Paul Brady 
Jr., Irvine's assistant city manager. The tax applies to entertainment 
facilities with a capacity greater than 1,500. Aside from UC Irvine facilities, 
which are exempt, the 15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows is the only entertainment 
operation in Irvine large enough to be subject to the fee. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody doesn't have a problem with a tax, but we recognize why 
it has to be," Bob Geddes, Irvine Meadows' managing partner, said Wednesday. 
"The last thing we want to do is (make the city pay for costs) that are 
rightfully ours. We tried to do some lobbying to perhaps reconfigure (the tax) 
or reduce it, or at least put a lid on it but we were OK with it in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Meadows already adds a $1.50 "surcharge" of its own to the face price of 
tickets -- with the surcharge money kept by the amphitheater to cover its own 
costs. Geddes said that ticket buyers will now see a $2 "surcharge/tax" listed 
on their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Since it opened in 1981, Irvine Meadows has reimbursed the city of Irvine for 
the salaries paid to police officers assigned to concert details. The new tax 
will cover salaries as well as the cost of equipment needed to police the 
concerts. That includes 2 paddy wagons, 5 patrol cars and 19 radio sets. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department assigns 15 to 23 officers to Irvine Meadows on sold-out 
concert nights, Brady said. The cost -- time-and-a-half under the police 
officers' contract -- is $37 per hour (including benefits) for regular 
officers, and $42 for supervisors, for an estimated annual total of $153,000.

UMI'S FARE RANGES FROM WONDERFUL TO FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have to confess that I was more than a bit surprised to see a puppy at the 
sushi bar in Umi, a high-tech Japanese restaurant on Newport Boulevard. There 
he was, perched on his hind legs for a better view of the uni (sea urchin), 
ikura (salmon roe), unagi (sea eel) and other goodies behind the counter, while 
his master -- one of the customers -- watched him faithfully. We didn't catch 
what they ordered. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of visits to this modern, imaginative and sometimes sloppy 
operation, I came away feeling a bit waggish myself. The food at this 
restaurant has a lot of originality, and some of it is wonderful. But table 
service is slow and the quality of the restaurant's hot prepared dishes is 
spotty -- sit at the sushi bar, where things run more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
The room is a small, artful space, painted a sleek pastel gray. A striking, 
geometric, three-tiered overhang magically extends the sushi bar upward, and 
black-lacquer tables embellished with spare bamboo mats and cloth napkins 
provide the restaurant with its one touch of elegant conservatism. Don't expect 
piped in koto or shamisen music -- that would be far too traditional. New-age 
jazz fits the place a whole lot better and, besides, that's what you hear in 
Tokyo these days. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi at Umi is generally fresh and handsomely crafted, but what stands out 
particularly is the quality of the rice. The Japanese discuss the taste of rice 
almost endlessly, and often eat it plain, with nothing to disguise its flavors. 
And at a sushi restaurant, the rice is almost always of the best quality. Umi's 
rice is no exception. Short-grain Japanese rice is used. It's shiny, fluffy and 
soft -- so soft I could eat it plain myself, or at least garnished with nothing 
more than tsukemono (Japanese pickles). 
</P>
<P>
Not that I ever would -- the fish is too good to pass up here. Ask for omakase, 
literally "chef's choice," and you might get a delightfully smooth piece of raw 
salmon; some chewy, flavorful octopus; hot, smoky eel; hamachi, or yellowtail; 
and some fine, fatty tuna belly, all draped over sculpted pieces of vinegared 
rice arranged like little flowers on a silvered tray. 
</P>
<P>
But as omakase changes from day to day (depending on the chef's mood and what 
he thinks tastes freshest), you may get a totally different selection than what 
I enjoyed. Maybe you'll get sea urchin in a seaweed wrapper, yellowtail, flying 
fish roe, sweet shrimp and pounded squid. And you can always order a la carte. 
If you do, don't miss the salmon-skin roll filled with jewel-like slices of 
carrot, cucumber and gobo (burdock root), or the wonderfully creamy sea urchin, 
which is often sold out. 
</P>
<P>
One of my Japanese guests pointed out that the sushi at Umi was not cut as 
perfectly as it would have been in a top establishment, a complaint that may be 
more meaningful in Tokyo than in Newport Beach. But after a fashion I too began 
to observe a pattern of tiny lapses in service and presentation. 
</P>
<P>
This became more apparent when hot dishes began to arrive. Hot appetizers and 
entrees can also be ordered at the sushi bar, but because they take up more 
space, you may be asked to move to one of the tables. There you get colorful 
menus, printed on pretty confetti rice paper, which list the dozens of 
specialty dishes. A few off-menu specials are recited by the waiter. 
</P>
<P>
This is where things may get frustrating. Many of the dishes are quite good; 
some are just so-so. But both nights I dined there, I found the hot kitchen 
woefully slow and dishes did not come out in the sequence in which they were 
ordered -- despite the fact that the restaurant was not full. 
</P>
<P>
Umi Japanese scallop casserole was one of the good ones, a mixture of scallop, 
shiitake and shimeji mushroom, with the surprise addition of mirugai (giant 
clam), baked en coquille in a light mayonnaise sauce. Umi Japanese steak was 
another hit: tender sliced steak in a light demi-glace with ginger, garlic and 
shallot, plated beautifully with nicely cooked green bean and carrot, and the 
bonus of a lemon slice covered with flying fish roe. I wish everything else 
worked as well. 
</P>
<P>
Fried dishes were especially erratic: The house tempura, batter-fried morsels 
of fish and vegetables, came out leaden and soggy, not at all crisp and light 
as it should have been. And many of the other fry dishes, such as shibaebi 
(small shrimp) and soft-shell crab, simply lacked the delicacy that they needed 
to make them stand on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Better were the special karei (deep-fried flounder served Chinese style, fried 
bones and all) and the deep-fried mustard crumbs chicken, a fine, flaky half 
chicken stuffed with heady pinches of pungent Japanese mustard and then rolled 
in spicy crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
We finished with an upbeat bar snack called yaki-onigiri, which are usually 
eaten at Japanese picnics. These are grilled triangles of sushi rice filled 
with a variety of things such as umeboshi (Japanese pickled plum), shiokombu 
(salted seaweed) or kazuobushi (shaved bonito). They are absolutely delicious 
and not on the menu, so by all means ask for them. Don't worry about not 
finishing. They travel well in a doggie bag. 
</P>
<P>
Umi is inexpensive to moderate. Sushi starts at $3. Appetizers are $4.50 to $7. 
Entrees, which come with miso soup, salad, steamed rice and fresh fruit are 
$11.50 to $14.50.

FROM KARATE TO TEAR GAS, PEOPLE CHOOSE THEIR WEAPONS

<P>
Kym Donegan wasn't feeling paranoid, exactly, but still, in 1980s Orange 
County, there are reasons to worry. People do get attacked. There are bad guys 
out there. So she started looking around for a class that would teach her how 
to take care of herself. 
</P>
<P>
One thing she didn't want was an "obnoxious, macho" teacher. Nor was she 
interested in what she called "Hollywood karate." When she heard about a class 
taught by a woman, she said, "I expected the worst . . . hair on her knuckles, 
an Army drill sergeant type." What she got instead was Revina Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 5 feet 2, and she's shorter than I am," Donegan said of Lewis. But that 
isn't always as important as it might appear. Sure, no one wants to run into 
Mike Tyson on a midnight-dark side street, but, as Lewis points out, it takes 
only 40 pounds of pressure on a knee to make the bone snap and pop. 
</P>
<P>
Months after the class, Donegan still speaks with awe of Lewis ("I would hate 
to meet her in a dark alley") and her course ("It was great"). 
</P>
<P>
For Laurie Wallis, a 25-year-old Costa Mesa hairdresser, the impetus for 
self-protection came from her boyfriend, Paul Howard, who attended a class with 
her that enabled both of them to obtain licenses to carry tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
Wallis said she wanted to be able to legally carry Mace or a similar aerosol 
tear gas "just for protection." Howard said the class "was my idea. I want her 
to have it. I feel safer if she's out places at night" by herself. 
</P>

Howard, 29, of Laguna Hills, said he wanted the tear gas to help him in his job 
as a bartender -- not for some exotic new cocktail but to give him a boost if 
there are any repeats of the "couple of instances of customers who were 
intoxicated to a violent point" and decided to try to punch him out. 
</P>
<P>
In classrooms, gyms and private homes across the county, people are learning 
how to use tear gas and fists, karate and kicks to the groin to defend 
themselves. The people who teach the courses say demand is steady. It doesn't 
take a spectacular crime wave to bring customers to their doors. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Adams, for instance, can count on having a dozen to two dozen people 
at a time in his classes on the use of tear gas, which he teaches twice a month 
at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana and periodically at corporations that 
ask him to conduct classes for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
Tear gas "was popular in '80 or '81," Adams said. "It hit its heyday during 
that time. It was really a fad then. (Now it has) settled back into what is a 
legitimate self-defense class." 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of tear gas coincided with the early years of its legalization. 
Since 1977, California residents have been able to legally buy and carry 
tear-gas canisters -- which look like cans of hair spray -- if they have a 
permit. To obtain the piece of paper, they must attend a class such as Adams' 
and pass a written test, which Adams guarantees his pupils they cannot possibly 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
A former Santa Ana police lieutenant who now teaches criminal justice at Rancho 
Santiago College, Adams lays out the basics to his students in no-nonsense 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to get hurt when you defend yourself," he warns, pointing out the 
goal is to minimize the hurt to oneself, maximize the hurt to the assailant. 
"You're going to cause pain. . . . You have to cause pain if you're going to 
force the individual to do what you want him to do." 
</P>
<P>
Tear gas causes a victim's eyes and face to sting and burn as if hit by a blast 
from hell. Students' noses wrinkle and their eyes well up as Adams passes 
around a Q-tip with just a dab of the chemical on it. In the words of Adams' 
course outline: "The recipient usually experiences a complete rearrangement of 
priorities, making it extremely difficult to concentrate on anything but the 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
The downside, as Adams noted to his students, is that if you spray the gas into 
the wind, it could be you who winds up with the "rearrangement of priorities." 
</P>
<P>
A trim man with hands that look as if they could crumple a larynx in seconds, 
Adams also showed the class other tools of self-defense: a stun gun and a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
A stun gun, which looks like a flashlight, can be carried without a license and 
delivers 40,000 volts of electricity that would shock an assailant and cause 
muscular spasms. But the gun itself has to make physical contact with the 
victim, while tear gas just has to be in the area of the face. 
</P>
<P>
A license from the sheriff or police department is needed to carry a pistol in 
California unless it is unloaded and not concealed. Adams warns his students 
that if they do decide to tote a handgun, they should be prepared to use it, 
not merely wave it as a threat. And that means being able to live with the 
consequences of possibly killing someone. As Adams put it: "Please don't carry 
an instrument of death unless you plan to use it." 
</P>
<P>
There are enough people who do want to learn how to use guns that the Straight 
Shooter gun range in Orange usually has to turn people away from its training 
classes, said Mark Seko, the range general manager. 
</P>
<P>
On an average day, the range will get 200 people trying their hands at target 
shooting, Seko said. Rookies must take a 4-hour basic firearms class offered by 
Straight Shooter before being allowed on the range with an instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Business is always "pretty good," Seko said, but it picks up during a heavily 
publicized crime wave, such as the one that gripped the Southland when the 
"Night Stalker" was on the prowl nearly 4 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Revina Lewis believes there's no need to wait for a crime to happen to take one 
of her courses, although, unfortunately, she said, some of her students do 
procrastinate until some event propels them into class. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's been something very sensational" in the news, such as a series of 
rapes, "then you find more women kind of taking their heads out of the sand, as 
we say, and doing something about the problem," she said. "But very often women 
want to ignore the problem and think it won't happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis teaches defensive techniques in a physical education course at Rancho 
Santiago College and elsewhere. She teaches how to search for an attacker's 
vulnerable points, how to poke someone in the eye, belt him on the nose, break 
his knee. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that "body language" can be important in deterring a potential 
assailant, especially for a woman. Don't look down at the ground, shoulders 
rounded, mind a million miles away, she counsels. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to try to walk like I'm aware of what's going on around me, and strong. 
We used to say, 'Look like a football player.' It has nothing to do with sexual 
(mannerisms), but don't look like you're going to be a good victim. Also, if 
someone's looking at you, look at their eyes, not down. That shows a strength." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said there are different theories on what to do if an assailant is armed, 
but she believes that "unless the knife is slashing or (the attacker) is about 
ready to pull the trigger, maintain a calmness . . . rather than fighting that 
weapon. When he puts the weapon down, then at that time there's something you 
can do. 
</P>
<P>
"But police said even if there is a weapon, never get in a car with someone and 
go from a public place to a desolate area. I would rather try to call (an 
attacker's) bluff there and maybe even be knifed in a parking lot than taken to 
a desert area and knifed." 
</P>
<P>
Self-defense courses can range from 2 hours for Adams' tear-gas lesson to 
several weeks or months for some of Lewis' offerings, to years or a lifetime 
for people who want to become truly proficient in one of the martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Rossmannek claims that someone who took his American karate class four or 
five times a week for a year would be in good enough shape to fight off 
multiple attackers. Rossmannek, who taught self-defense to Lewis years ago, 
said his class is "essentially a combination of all the Asian fighting arts, 
with emphasis on kick-boxing." 
</P>
<P>
He described the lessons, which he gives privately and at Rancho Santiago 
College, as "a more street-oriented, practical, applied martial art" than some 
of the pure Asian disciplines such as judo or karate, which are steeped in 
Oriental philosophy as much as in aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Rossmannek has a master's degree in psychology and says his basic self-defense 
courses include tips on the psychology of defending oneself, instructing women 
especially that "there is a point in this violent confrontation where women 
will have an advantage. That's where psychology comes in, waiting for a guy to 
make a mistake and destroying him." 
</P>
<P>
He also stresses self-awareness, pointing out that "most of the time you 
wouldn't need (self-defense) if you were a little more careful. Of course that 
0.1% when it happens to you unexpectedly, then you're glad you have it." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Hulme is glad she has it and happy she hasn't had to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Hulme, who took a course taught by Lewis at a private athletic club in 
Fullerton, said she thinks there's a need to know self-defense these days. For 
one thing, she feels there's more crime occurring; for another, she has a 
2-year-old son and says that "when I'm out with him, I'd like to be able to 
defend him if anything happened." 
</P>
<P>
Does she do anything differently since taking the class? "I feel more alert, 
and I tend to look over my shoulder a lot more. And I just make sure when I'm 
walking into a car park, I'm looking all around. I'm looking under the car as I 
approach it. When I get into the car now, I always lock it." 
</P>
<P>
She said the course emphasized just what she wanted -- "self-defense moves, not 
aggressive moves, just things I could do to run away from somebody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEANS OF SELF-DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
A canister of aerosol tear gas, sometimes sold under the trademark Mace, can 
cost from $10 to $25 and is sold at various sporting goods shops in Orange 
County. A buyer needs a permit, obtainable after completing a 3-hour lecture 
and passing a written test. Aerosol tear gas will cause a victim to feel a 
burning sensation and often will disorient the victim. It does not knock 
someone unconscious and if used in a wind, can blow back into the face of the 
user. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American karate is essentially a combination of all the Asian fighting arts, 
such as karate and judo, with emphasis on kick-boxing. Instructor Fred 
Rossmanek calls it "a more street-oriented, practical, applied martial art" 
than martial arts in their pure form. His class at Rancho Santiago College 
involves one 4-hour session a week for 9 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Street-fighting techniques stress awareness of a dangerous situation and 
avoidance, with action only as a last resort. Techniques include using body 
language to avoid appearing a likely victim of an attack, running away and 
basic ways to block an attack and to kick and strike back at an assailant.,

There were 55,159 Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students enrolled in Orange 
County schools as of March, 1988, the latest information available. LEP 
students are defined as those for whom English is not their first language and 
who score higher in their primary language than in English on basic skills 
assessment tests. Statistics are kept for the top 10 primary languages (other 
than English) in California. Spanish is far and away the top primary language 
among LEP students in Orange County, outstripping the second-place Vietnamese 
by more than a 5-to-1 margin.

Description: Bills are long and slightly curved. The breeding male is 
orange-yellow with a black upper back, wings and tail. A black patch extends 
over throat area, and there are two whitish bars on the wings. Female lacks 
black throat and back. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Riparian woodland, palm groves, arid scrub, deciduous woodland, around 
human habitation. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Insects, nectar, fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: In courtship, on elevated perch, male performs series of exaggerated 
bows toward female as he approaches, then hops around her singing softly with 
head pointed skyward; female may respond with similar posture. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Hanging nest, suspended from twigs or woven through overhanging leaves of 
palm. When located in palm trees, as they often are in Orange County suburban 
neighborhoods, nest often rests on palm fronds rather than hanging freely. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Dull white marked with browns, purples and grays; slightly less than 1 
inch long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Hooded orioles are partial to palms for nesting, and 
they are especially common in suburban areas where palms and exotic shrubs are 
extensively planted. Brown-headed cowbird chicks are sometimes found in oriole 
broods. The cowbird is a nest parasite that lays its eggs in nests belonging to 
other species and whose young are raised by surrogate parents. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 
962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160.

The environmental health division of Orange County's Health Care Agency 
performs routine unannounced inspections of the county's more than 6,000 
restaurants, markets and other food establishments. When conditions violate 
state law or applicable county and municipal codes, inspectors can issue 
notices of violation. If inspectors find during an announced recheck that 
conditions cited in the notice have not been rectified, they can effectively 
close the business by suspending its health permit. Inspectors can also issue a 
summary health permit suspension during a routine inspection if they find an 
immediate health threat. In all cases, health permits are reinstated as soon as 
the situation is rectified. Following is a list of March suspensions.
