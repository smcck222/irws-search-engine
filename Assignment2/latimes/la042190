SHOULD A MASTER-SLAVE RELATIONSHIP CONTINUE?; 
</P>
<P>
LITHUANIA: THE BALTIC LAND IS NOT SEEKING TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENCE, BUT TO 
RESTORE AN INDEPENDENT STATE ILLEGALLY SUPPRESSED BY AN OCCUPIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VYTAUTAS LANDSBERGIS, Vytautas Landsbergis is president of Lithuania. This 
article was translated by Ginte Damusis. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no shortage of advice for solving the Lithuanian question these days. 
But to solve the problem, one has to understand it. The latest trend, in both 
Soviet and Western circles, is to urge "a fair and objective" way out of the 
stalemate for all parties concerned -- the Soviet Union, Lithuania and the 
Western governments, who are under public pressure to support our drive for 
independence. However, some of the offered solutions are neither fair nor 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet spokesman argue that the unruly Lithuanians should respect and follow 
orderly Soviet constitutional procedures. After all, they concede, the 
Lithuanians are entitled to independence, if they want it. But as a 
"constituent part of the Soviet Union," they must abide by the procedures of 
Soviet law that will make their independence possible. 
</P>
<P>
Herein lies the basic flaw in this argument. Lithuania is not seeking to 
establish independence, it is working to restore an independent state that had 
been illegally suppressed by a foreign power and its army. It is not calling 
for secession from the Soviet Union because it never legally joined the Soviet 
Union. This is not just a legal nicety but the basic and non-negotiable premise 
of our March 11 declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
When Soviet spokesmen speak of the right to secession, this right does not 
apply to Lithuania: It is not legally tenable. The Baltic countries, Lithuania 
included, have always maintained, and the world recognizes, that they were 
illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union. The Congress of People's Deputies 
of the Soviet Union last December itself declared illegal the document that 
gave birth to the Soviet occupation, namely, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet law, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says that Lithuania's right to 
self-determination can be realized only through the mechanism that he approves 
and provides. After all, we are told, he is not denying our right to self-rule, 
he is merely contesting the pace of secession. But we don't believe he has any 
intention of letting Lithuania or the Baltic states go through any secession 
law. The law gives the Congress of People's Deputies -- to which, it must be 
recalled, Gorbachev appointed himself and 99 of his Communist colleagues -- the 
right to veto secession by any Soviet republic, even if two-thirds of its 
registered voters express their desire for independence. 
</P>
<P>
Though we are not bound by any Soviet constitution, our actions of March 11 
were fully consistent with a constitutional provision that provides each Soviet 
republic's legislature with the right to secede. Moreover, the Soviet 
constitution states that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a voluntary 
union of states. 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviet Union enjoyed a system of checks and balances similar to the U.S. 
system, along with an independent Supreme Court that could rule on the legality 
of decisions by the Soviet legislature and executive, then a "Soviet Supreme 
Court" would approve the restoration of independence in the Baltic states 
because their forcible incorporation contradicts the "voluntary union" clause 
of the Soviet Constitution and not permit the retroactive application of a 
punitive law. 
</P>
<P>
But that is precisely what the Congress of People's Deputies has tried to do by 
declaring our March 11 vote invalid because it contradicted a secession law 
that did not even exist at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The April 5 secession legislation adopted by the Supreme Soviet states that, to 
secede, a republic must conduct a referendum. If no referendum was held in 1940 
to determine whether we wished to nullify our independence and to join the 
Soviet Union, why is a referendum needed now to determine whether this forcible 
incorporation should be ended? 
</P>
<P>
We have no illusions about our economic dependence on Moscow, but we find it 
hard to understand why in this day and age, a master-slave relationship should 
continue or even be encouraged -- surprisingly enough, by some Western friends 
-- as the solution to the problem? 
</P>
<P>
Our elections of Feb. 24 were democratic and legitimate. Pro-independence 
candidates proposed by Sajudis swept the elections under the campaign slogan of 
democracy and independence for Lithuania. Sajudis' political platform differed 
from that of its main opponent, the breakaway Lithuanian Communist Party, in 
that it advocated complete political independence as soon as possible and 
normal, diplomatic relations with Moscow on equal footing, whereas the party 
leadership still spoke in indeterminate terms of Lithuanian sovereignty 
"without the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to elections, the will of the Lithuanian people has been expressed 
many times at mass demonstrations and in at least two major petition drives. In 
1988, 1.8 million out of a population of 3.5 million rejected Soviet 
constitutional amendments that restricted the republic's sovereign rights. Last 
year, 1.6 million called for the renunciation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact 
and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lithuania. In light of these political 
realities, how can we possibly plan and decide our destiny by Moscow's rules 
and on Moscow's terms? We cannot just brush off our mandate. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has expressed its displeasure in recent weeks with a barrage of verbal 
and physical threats, blockades and other acts of force against our people. If 
the Soviet Union continues to use force to crush and smother Lithuanian 
independence, if the military takes over the parliament and imposes martial 
law, if Gorbachev attempts to keep Lithuania in the Soviet fold as a hostile 
captive, we will all lose. He will prove that perestroika is a collection of 
failed policies and not a genuine transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
But if Gorbachev extends democracy to his own back yard and recognizes the 
democratically elected government of neighboring Lithuania, if he presides over 
the peaceful dissolution of the last living empire on this Earth, if he deals 
with us as equal, friendly partners, we will all benefit. And he would go down 
as a great man in history. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem is not Lithuanian independence but how Moscow views itself. 
Our vote for freedom is forcing Moscow to take a stand -- for democracy or for 
preservation of the holy Soviet empire. Instead of facing the issue head on, 
the Soviet Union is focusing on a little antagonist, which was never an 
antagonist to begin with. In this pitifully unequal battle, Moscow is its own 
worst enemy.

WHY STOP AT RELEASING ONE?; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH SEES CLEARLY THROUGH THE TERRORISTS' CYNICAL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The offer dangled by pro-Iranian Lebanese militants to release one of their 
three American hostages lasted only about 24 hours before being cruelly yanked 
back, further evidence that psychological torment and political manipulation 
are the basic rules of the game that terrorists play. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine blamed an uncooperative U.S. 
attitude for the "delay" in freeing one of its kidnap victims. In fact 
President Bush unarguably did the right thing when he rejected the terrorists' 
demand that Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly travel to Damascus to 
discuss unspecified issues before one of the captives would be set free. 
There's nothing to negotiate, directly or indirectly, with Islamic Jihad 
terrorists. The only thing to be decided is the physical arrangements for the 
captives' release. That doesn't require Washington to bend its knee to the 
terrorists' dictate by committing a high-level envoy to open-ended talks. Such 
an approach would only give the event political significance that the 
terrorists -- and of course Syria -- could be counted on to milk for all it was 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
Based on recent official comments in Damascus and Tehran, one thing seems 
clear: Syria and at least one faction in Iran's government appear interested 
for their own reasons -- none of which have anything to do with humanitarianism 
-- in getting on a better footing with the United States. Syria faces a 
collapsing economy, an erosion in its long-time client relationship with the 
Soviet Union and worrisome muscle-flexing from its ideological enemy in 
next-door, Iraq. Syria thus sees value in moving to broaden its international 
relationships. Iran, on its part, is eager to get Western credits and 
technology to rebuild its war-shattered oil industry. All of this provides the 
incentive for both countries to appear to broker the release of a hostage, 
probably soon. But that would still leave seven Americans in terrorist hands in 
Lebanon. If Syria and Iraq can bring their influence to bear to get one hostage 
freed, why not all?

RUNNING TRAINS AT THE RIGHT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planners of a train between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles have found out 
just what it means to be in the new business of providing a train designed 
specifically for commuters. The name of the game is tailored service, sometimes 
within a matter of minutes, to the routines of commuters who must make a daily 
series of connections. 
</P>
<P>
The planners had their own set of scheduling questions to answer before the 
planned April 30 start-up date. It began with the fact that there already are 
existing Amtrak trains running between Los Angeles and San Diego that commuters 
regularly use. One problem was that to make a special Orange County trip in the 
late afternoon out of Los Angeles, it was necessary to turn that train around 
to be back in Los Angeles to run again as the regular southbound 9:10 p.m. to 
San Diego. To do that, the Orange County Transportation Commission proposed 
pushing a regular Amtrak 5:50 p.m. run back to 6:20 p.m. and inserting a 
commuter train at 5:30 p.m. that could successfully make the turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
In the real world of people's schedules, however, the change meant that some 
current commuters who took the 5:50 p.m. home would now have to take a train 20 
minutes earlier or wait until 6:20. Disgruntled passengers with long days and 
tight schedules walked the train to gather signatures. They argued for a train 
closer to the time they were used to. 
</P>
<P>
Credit the commission with listening, and luck. It managed to lease another 
commuter train. It's an answer to a commuter prayer: It will run as a 5:45 p.m. 
out of Los Angeles, at a cost of $300,000 in annual leasing, but at convenience 
to all. Here's an editorial that has a happy ending.

NOW CONGRESS IS THE PEACE OBSTACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is an energy in Nicaragua and a confidence -- unsupported by any evidence 
-- that something will turn up, which has kept that battered land running on 
empty well beyond what seems reasonable. Time and again, the energy and 
confidence have produced results that analysts denied were possible. Free 
elections were, indeed, held in February, and a coalition of parties hostile to 
the ruling Sandinista party did, indeed, win. 
</P>
<P>
After repeated false starts, the soldiers who make up what's left of the 
American-sponsored Contras have agreed to stop roaming the countryside and hand 
over their weapons to a United Nations peacekeeping force. That has not 
happened yet, but Contra leaders and Sandinista Defense Minister Humberto 
Ortega, the hard-line brother of President Daniel Ortega, have signed on. That 
would mean a peaceful transfer of government to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, 
the president-elect, on Wednesday -- another once-improbable event. 
</P>
<P>
But nature has now imposed a rigid deadline on one crucial aspect of 
Nicaragua's reconstruction, which means that if Congress isn't careful, it 
could wind up derailing the very recovery it says it wants for that 
long-ravaged country. Washington has lifted its trade embargo, putting 
Nicaragua in a position to resume exporting bananas, beef, coffee and other 
products that can earn dollars in the United States. With the spring planting 
season already upon them, farmers have to make decisions about crops. They need 
money to draw down some of Nicaragua's debts so that they can borrow for seed 
and new farm equipment. Yet Congress is sitting on President Bush's request for 
$300 million, money that would let them get that fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the peace and forging a real government from a coalition of 14 
fractious groups of supporters that include conservatives and Communists are 
challenges enough for Chamorro. But no matter how smoothly she might manage 
those tasks, Nicaragua's economy is the key to the future of the nation and to 
its fragile new democracy. Unemployment runs about 30%. If not uncountable, the 
inflation rate is unthinkable. Nicaragua can miss spring planting this year and 
still get back on its feet. But that might well take some of the edge off its 
sense of confidence. Congress must not let that happen.

LATINO INFLUX BRINGS CHANGE TO HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Cultures Follow Separate Paths in Huntington Park" (front page, 
April 7). 
</P>
<P>
It was nice reading about my hometown of Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
However, the "old Huntington Park" was not in the early 1960s, and many of the 
town's settlers were not "transplanted 'Okies' who escaped the Dust Bowl misery 
during the Depression." In the early 1930s, Huntington Park was already an 
established, rather snobbish, bedroom community for professional people who 
worked in Los Angeles or owned the surrounding manufacturing plants and local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
It cost only 4 cents to ride into L.A. on the streetcar at that time and 
Huntington Park, because of the excellent shopping, was the hub of the 
neighboring small towns. A 15-minute ride out of town would put you in the 
middle of the famous California orange groves where the sky was always blue and 
the air was filled with the smell of orange blossoms in bloom. When the 
original "Okies" came west they lived in cardboard piano boxes and tents on the 
vacant lots of Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 1950s, Huntington Park began a slow decline and would surely 
have ended up as a forgotten "has been" town. How wonderful that the Latinos 
have revived the spirit of Huntington Park and are giving it a new lease on 
life.

BREAKDOWN OF THE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Listen to Your Grandmother" (Editorial Page, April 7), I agree 
totally with David Blankenhorn's observation that the nation's "quality of 
family life" is deteriorating. His explanation that the cause is "Reagan closed 
the bathrooms," made me laugh out loud and say a dirty functional word! 
</P>
<P>
I guess I spent too many years in PTA not to be terribly concerned about the 
future of our children. Single-parent households simply cannot meet the needs 
of the children, as hard as they try. Though we observe a burning need for 
child care supported by government and the workplace, the responsibility is 
with the parents. Nothing will replace a two-parent family unit, even if it is 
not a Ozzie-and-Harriet ideal group. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really want a governmental agency teaching American values? Who will 
determine what those values will be? I remember being part of a group of 
parents and teachers attempting to get a sex education unit into the 7th grade 
20 years ago. Numerous people came before the school district committee to 
protest. These are "family issues," they said, to be determined by the 
individual family's religion, the ideals the parents want to promulgate, the 
individual child's maturity and social development. Teachers were uncomfortable 
with the subject matter, believing, too, these were matters, like many others, 
to be taught in the home. 
</P>
<P>
The grandmothers are right, Mr. Blankenhorn. Listen to them.

U.S. BISHOPS' PR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Novak simply misses the point regarding bishops and the abortion issue. What 
the bishops are being criticized for is not their stand, which they are 
entitled to, but their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he carefully avoids mentioning issues like the denial of communion to 
parishioners and the threatening of Catholic voters with divine retribution if 
they don't vote the Vatican party line. How does Novak fit such behavior into 
his model of "serious moral argument" conducted in a "rational and civil 
manner?" 
</P>
<P>
In the interest of civility, Novak might take a step away from his own style of 
hyperbolic and specious argument. The Vatican and "rock videos, movies and 
magazines" (whichever ones he means) are not the only available moral choices 
-- tens of millions of non-Christian Americans reject both and yet live moral 
lives. And if any comparison is to be drawn with slavery, it is that of women 
as a class, on the basis of religious ideology, being denied the right of 
reproductive choice. 
</P>
<P>
Should Novak have his way, it will be the pro-choice side, not the Catholic 
Church, running the underground railroads.

U.S. BISHOPS' PR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial states that "public relations and polling are not instruments of 
. . . moral argument" and should not be employed by the bishops. On the 
contrary; these are just the tools that should be used, since their worth is 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
From its founding, the church has tried to be resourceful in conveying the 
Gospel to all persons. This has never meant confining its message to the inside 
of a building. Today, the church attempts to be effective by utilizing current 
information-gathering methods -- including polling, or even consulting experts 
in non-theological fields, e.g., medicine, psychology or sociology. 
</P>
<P>
For The Times to argue that modern forms of information collection and 
disbursement are inappropriate for the bishops and are properly "tools of 
election politics" is to suggest that the church may not employ legitimate 
modes of communication. In other places and ages, the term used to describe The 
Times' position -- restricting ordinary forms of religious expression -- has 
been called "repression" or sometimes "censorship." Or can The Times propose a 
modern epithet for the ancient notion of discrimination?

U.S. BISHOPS' PR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Novak is upset because of the heat the Catholic bishops are taking over their 
opposition to abortion. Why, he asks, were these same bishops cheered when they 
favored a nuclear freeze and progressive views on economics? There are several 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
First, the bishops' public efforts to kick out of the Catholic Church any 
politician who differs with them on the abortion issue repels those of us who 
cherish freedom of expression. Many women see the church's campaign as a thinly 
disguised attempt to keep them pregnant and in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Just a quick glance over our southern border will show anyone with eyes in his 
head the terrible effects of the bishops' opposition to any form of birth 
control or abortion: wretched poverty, overcrowding, and a vast army of young 
people with no way to earn a living. These same young Latin Americans are 
flooding across our borders, creating problems in this country. The reluctance 
of the French drug company that invented an abortion pill, which could cure 
many other diseases, to market it in this country because of gangster-like 
threats from the anti-abortionists, also repels those of us who cherish 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
No, Mr. Novak, this is no "happy day" as you would have us believe. This is a 
case of a church that is still operating as it did in the Middle Ages. And the 
most sickening part is that, because churches don't pay taxes, they are 
indirectly using our tax dollars to finance their nonsense. For shame!

POOR AMERICANS MISSING OUT ON SPECIAL PENSION BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "Up to 4.6 Million Are Losing Out on Special Benefits" (Part A, 
April 6) contained some inaccuracies, especially for California readers. 
Studies do show that a number of people have not applied for Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI) payments for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Some are not aware of the program, some feel a stigma in applying for what your 
writer describes as a "welfare program." In reality, the program is designed to 
provide a guaranteed amount of income to disabled, blind or aged individuals 
with limited resources and limited income. 
</P>
<P>
One of the primary reasons why people have not applied in California is because 
they often believe they have too much income to be eligible. Here your story 
may have done a disservice. The maximums quoted there were only federal payment 
levels and, since California supplements those levels, our payments are much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals living in their own home, can be eligible for SSI payments in 
California of up to $630 per month and for couples the payments may be as high 
as $1,167. (In other living situations the payments can even be higher.) All 
other income received by the person is subtracted from those payment amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Because the studies have shown that not everyone who could be eligible is 
applying, we have mounted a massive campaign, led by Commissioner Gwendolyn S. 
King, to increase awareness about the SSI program. All of our offices are 
participating.

<P>
As a final word, the article mentions a "15-page application," which frightens 
potential applicants. Since the applications are complex, our trained

McDonnell Douglas: The St. Louis aerospace firm said first-quarter profit 
totaled $2 million, down substantially from the $169-million profit recorded in 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 19% to $3.8 billion. The 1989 results included a change in 
accounting rules that added $179 million to the firm's net income. Without that 
change, the 1989 quarter posted a $10-million loss. The firm said gains in its 
combat aircraft segment were offset by a large loss in transport aircraft and 
lower earnings in missiles, space and electronic systems.

Regarding Jack Mathews' April 12 commentary, "Is It Time to Change the Ratings 
System for Movies?": Perhaps it is time for an A rating (for adults only); but 
after reading his synopsis of the movies he thought needed an A rating, I 
couldn't help but wonder why anyone would want to make those film -- or watch

Recently I bought two tickets advertised at $21 each to see Midnight Oil at the

By the time Ticketmaster was through with me, those same tickets cost $28 each. 
For those of you scoring at home, that's a full 33% surcharge.

FUNDING OF PUBLIC TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharon Bernstein's "An Advertiser Finds a Spot on Public TV" (April 7) more 
than anything else points up the financial plight of public television, 
increasingly caught between twin mandates: to remain true to its mission and to 
be increasingly self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say we should put stricter limits on corporate underwriting and 
on-air identification of underwriters. 
</P>
<P>
Others say we should reduce or eliminate on-air fund drives. Still others want 
us to curtail telemarketing and direct-mail membership efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestions come after the Reagan Administration cut real dollar federal 
support of public broadcasting and passed tax law changes that made it 
increasingly difficult for individuals to contribute to nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, California is one of only two states that give no support to public 
broadcasting. And only one of every seven viewers of KCET contribute to the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
These are facts of life. It would be helpful if the critics would acknowledge 
their existence and provide constructive suggestions.

ADDING NEW TOWNS TO MAP -- SOLUTIONS OR NEW WOES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAKEBOROUGH, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't bother running to a map of California. 
</P>
<P>
Lakeborough doesn't exist yet, except in the minds of some developers who hope 
next year to begin building a town from scratch for 28,000 residents on what is 
now 4,300 acres of arid Central Valley farmland. 
</P>
<P>
Like a handful of other new communities on the drawing boards in California -- 
with colorful names such as Mountain House and Rancho San Benito -- Lakeborough 
is designed to help ease the Bay Area housing crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area residents increasingly are flocking to ever-distant suburbs in quest 
of affordable homes, despite often staggering commutes on clogged highways to 
offices in the East Bay or factories in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
And in the next decade, hundreds of thousands more people are expected to pour 
into California, further straining the housing supply. 
</P>
<P>
With new towns, proponents say, carefully planned houses, roads, jobs, 
firehouses, police stations, town halls, schools and recreational facilities 
could be created in a self-contained spot, making it easier for residents to 
live and play where they work and thereby avoiding the pitfalls of sprawling 
subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents fear that new towns will simply devour prized farmland and end up 
as isolated burgs, adding to the criss-cross congestion they propose to ease. 
Some skeptics denounce the explosion of new town proposals as simply a 
glorified marketing ploy by developers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to be said for the notion of designing new towns," said Thomas 
Cook, director of housing and land-use for the Bay Area Council, a San 
Francisco-based group that promotes regional thinking. "But it's not clear to 
me that some of the optimistic projections of developers for a balance of jobs 
and housing will be realized." 
</P>
<P>
The rash of proposals has set up a classic confrontation between developers on 
one side, who see the potential for hefty profits, and advocates of slow growth 
and farmland preservation on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Trimark Communities, the Tracy-based developer of Mountain House, a 
town for 30,000 residents proposed for the dry, windy foothills of southwestern 
San Joaquin County between Livermore and Tracy off Interstate 580. Trimark just 
submitted a formal application after spending three years and millions of 
dollars on environmental, engineering and other studies. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, it prepared 15 versions of its plan in response to ecological 
and other concerns. It cut the project in half after Alameda County, site of 
half the original acreage, opposed development of its agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
But the project is still two to five years from winning the needed approvals 
and breaking ground, and the first phase would not be completed until 2010 or 
so, according to Kitty Walker, senior planner for San Joaquin County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a development for the faint of heart," acknowledged Timothy A. Tosta, 
a San Francisco attorney advising Trimark. "It requires enormous patience, 
enormous vision and very deep pockets." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of making towns out of whole cloth is scarcely new. About 1900, a 
British city planner named Ebenezer Howard, seeking to stem the flow of 
job-hungry rural residents into already crowded cities, proposed the creation 
of self-sufficient "garden cities" that would offer urban amenities but would 
be surrounded by farmland. 
</P>
<P>
Two such towns arose in England in Howard's lifetime; they served as models for 
towns organized by the government after World War II. (Howard was knighted in 
1927.) 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Reston, Va., and Columbia, Md., both built in the 1960s, 
top planning experts' lists of successful new towns. 
</P>
<P>
Roger E. Simon Jr. was the force behind Reston, although start-up costs forced 
him to sell out to the real estate subsidiary of a giant oil company. Today the 
town has more than 40,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, founded by James W. Rouse's Rouse Co. in 1967, has more than 70,000 
people and expects to have 100,000 at full development. Promotional material 
crows that "each year, Columbia is becoming more and more the thriving, vibrant 
community envisioned in the midst of rural Howard County just a few short years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
With those notable exceptions, new town development in this country has largely 
flopped. There was a flurry of government interest in the 1960s, when the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development supported a dozen proposals with 
loan guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those projects defaulted because of poor locations, economic downturns, 
high land costs, environmental challenges or the inability to attract jobs. 
</P>
<P>
When the synthetic fuels industry collapsed in the early 1980s in Colorado, for 
example, Exxon Corp. scaled back plans for a proposed town called Battlement 
Mesa on the Colorado River and began peddling it as a retirement community. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co.'s "master planned community" of Irvine in Orange County occasionally 
makes a list of successful new towns. But critics have maintained that its 
tight design controls and upscale nature have made it sterile and that it lacks 
the "sense of place" of a true new town. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently mentioned as a model town is Seaside, a tiny Florida locale designed 
by Miami-based architect Andres Duany, who happened to be attorney Tosta's 
roommate at Princeton. Widely praised as bringing back such 19th-Century 
touches as strolling, front porches and picket fences, it has primarily 
succeeded as a resort. 
</P>
<P>
In advocating new towns for California, developers point to the uncontrolled 
spillover that has afflicted urban areas and spawned anti-growth movements. 
They say that by paying attention to such issues as long-term livability and 
town governance they can improve on traditional subdivisions and create 
socially beneficial environments. 
</P>
<P>
"People are becoming dissatisfied with some of the present patterns of 
development," said Bruce W. Liedstrand, former city manager of Mountain View, 
Calif., and now head of Liedstrand Associates, a San Francisco-based firm that 
devised the Mountain House concept, which features a series of neighborhoods 
each centered on a village hall. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify as a true new town, a development must have four basic ingredients, 
according to Reid Ewing, a senior planner with an Orlando, Fla., design firm 
that is working on several new town projects throughout the country. Ewing is 
author of "New Community Development Guide," which the Urban Land Institute in 
Washington expects to publish soon. 
</P>
<P>
A new town must have at least 2,000 acres and 20,000 people upon completion; it 
must have a balanced mix of land-uses, with jobs, recreation and services 
within easy reach of housing, thereby promoting walking instead of driving; it 
must have been master-planned before any construction was begun, and all land 
must be owned and controlled initially by a single property owner. 
</P>
<P>
New towns are "like a blank tablet," Ewing said, with the developer ensuring 
that all uses are "consistent with the vision." 
</P>
<P>
But one harsh opponent dismisses the concept as "bogus." 
</P>
<P>
"It's usually an excuse to look for cheap land and put up a subdivision," said 
Larry Orman, executive director of the Greenbelt Alliance, a 30-year-old 
nonprofit group dedicated to preserving open space. "The amount of housing 
they'll build is trivial compared to the overall need." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, something has to give if California is to handle its frenzied growth. 
</P>
<P>
Planners point to once-sleepy farm towns such as Modesto and Stockton that have 
erected countless subdivisions and become bedroom communities for the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Even unlikely places such as Patterson (population 6,700), an agricultural 
outpost in Stanislaus County that is the self-proclaimed "apricot capital of 
the world," is growing like Topsy, with asphalt and houses sprouting on the 
rich farmland. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's sliding over from the Bay Area; housing is going nuts," said Marty 
Pupka, who with his wife, Gail, recently bought the Pizza Plus restaurant in 
Patterson and moved from Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Pupka said, houses have been shoddily built in developers' zeal 
to quickly capitalize on the trend. 
</P>
<P>
The prices of some newer homes in Patterson, residents say, have doubled or 
tripled in the last two years, to nearly $200,000, hefty by Patterson's 
standards but still well below the prices in San Francisco or San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much easier to have a developer come in than to replant the orchards," 
Pupka said. "It's sad, but that's life." 
</P>
<P>
About five miles south of Patterson is the hilly farmland that two Stanislaus 
County families plan to sell to developer O'Brien &amp; Hicks for the new town 
of Lakeborough. 
</P>
<P>
Spotting an opportunity to create housing and jobs in an orderly way -- and to 
profitably rid themselves of difficult-to-farm land -- the owners of Beltran 
Farms and Sunflower Ranch pooled their properties in 1987 and asked the county 
to designate the land for urban development for a town they proposed to call 
Dos Ranchos. They were rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, their project is apparently closest to breaking ground of 
those being planned in California. If the necessary approvals come through, 
construction of roads and sewer lines could begin as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough occurred largely because of Frank A. Borges, whose Santa Rosa 
firm specializes in securing land-use permits. He hired a gaggle of consultants 
to analyze the site in terms of air quality, traffic congestion, biological 
concerns, water availability and even archeology, all in an attempt to head off 
future problems. 
</P>
<P>
He also found a good match in O'Brien &amp; Hicks, a San Mateo development firm 
that shared the ranchers' concern that a new town be intelligently conceived 
and executed. 
</P>
<P>
Borges said his work entailed involving all potential adversaries in the 
planning process. The development team met with a raft of grass-roots groups 
and agencies, including the California Department of Fish and Game, the Army 
Corps of Engineers, various water control boards, federal highway officials and 
the U.S. Navy, which operates an auxiliary air station nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Plans were devised to add two highway interchanges, at a cost of at least $10 
million each. 
</P>
<P>
All told, the firm expects to build 10,000 units of housing on 2,100 acres, 
from low-density housing with five units to the acre to high-density 
condominiums with 20 units per acre. Prices are expected to range from $89,000 
to $300,000, although those could be driven higher if the developer must pick 
up greater-than-expected infrastructure costs. 
</P>
<P>
No employers have yet agreed to put offices there, but the town expects 
ultimately to provide 15,000 jobs. Stanislaus County will require that the 
developer devise a transportation plan, including car pools and staggered work 
shifts, to limit vehicle use. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things O'Brien &amp; Hicks did was to change the project's 
name to Lakeborough, to "evoke that water image," Reed said. He added that the 
developer has obtained rights to water from both the California Aqueduct and 
the Delta Mendota federal canal and that it is proposing the use of reclaimed 
water for all irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
Water will be a strong selling point in the parched Central Valley, which has 
an average summer temperature of 94 degrees and average annual rainfall of just 
12 inches. A century ago, before engineers brought irrigation water to the 
valley, the land was suitable only for dry farming and grazing. (In winter, the 
valley is chilled by dense tule fog, a boon for the orchards but a bane of 
drivers.) 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty of irrigating crops prompted the ranchers to consider selling 
the properties, on which they grow walnuts, tomatoes, almonds, melons, 
tangeloes and lima beans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to pay more to pump the water uphill," said Fred E. Beltran, whose 
father in the 1940s farmed the sandy soil on which Los Angeles International 
Airport now sits. "Our view is there's a lot of other ground that's easier and 
better to farm on the valley floor. And affordable housing is something we 
desperately need." The Beltran family plans to use its proceeds to buy other 
farmland in Stanislaus County. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,300 acres, about 1,000 is designated prime agricultural land, and 
therein lies a potential hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanislaus County Farm Bureau last year adopted a policy stating that 
"under no circumstances should new towns be allowed on prime farmland or lands 
of statewide importance." The bureau also opposes new town proposals that would 
divert water from agricultural uses. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Ennenga, executive manager of the Stanislaus County Farm Bureau, said the 
agency has not yet taken a stance on the Lakeborough proposal. But in general 
she fears that the loss of prime lands could ultimately cripple agriculture, 
California's No. 1 industry. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs Nisbet, a spokeswoman with the American Farmland Trust in San Francisco, 
noted that prime land is being lost at the rate of nearly 20,000 acres a year 
in the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It would definitely be better if any new development went into less viable 
soils," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cash-starved counties, however, are unlikely to resist the lure of such 
development. Developers sell the idea that the communities will be 
unincorporated and that businesses and residents therefore will contribute to 
county coffers. 
</P>
<P>
But "one of these days the yuppies and yuppie puppies will say we need a city 
council, and then the fun starts," said Victor Holanda, planning director for 
Stanislaus County. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, Holanda sees new towns as one way to grapple with growth 
pressures. "Growth throughout the state is inevitable," he said. "By 
accommodating the growth but deflecting it to non-prime (agricultural) land, 
there is a dual benefit. The real challenge is to try to come up with the 
jobs-housing balance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Planned 'New Town' 
</P>
<P>
On 4,300 acres of Central Valley farmland, the development firm of O'Brien 
&amp; Hicks is proposing to build a town from scratch called Lakeborough. If 
all goes as planned, the town eventually will have 15,000 jobs and be home to 
28,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial Office-Industrial: 
</P>
<P>
Employers in office parks just off Interstate 5 are expected to range from 
financial institutions to engineering firms to high-tech manufactures. 
</P>
<P>
Low Density Residential: 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 single-family homes will be built on lots ranging from 3,500 square 
feet to 12,000 square feet, with an average of eight houses per acre. 
</P>
<P>
Medium Density Residential: 
</P>
<P>
Condominiums and townhomes, as well as smaller, detached, single-family houses, 
will be included in 2,000 housing units built 14 to the acre. 
</P>
<P>
Med-High Density Residential: 
</P>
<P>
These 3,000 units will include primarily rental apartments and townhomes, with 
25 per acre.

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's chief spokesman said Friday that he could foresee 
no circumstances under which the United States would return to Mexico a 
defendant in the torture-slaying of a U.S. drug enforcement officer, despite a 
federal judge's "considerable concern" about the suspect's apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, the spokesman, also said that any threat to U.S.-Mexican 
cooperation on drug law enforcement stemming from the incident had 
"substantially lessened" after discussions Thursday between Thornburgh and 
Mexico's Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, meanwhile, said the Drug Enforcement Administration has confirmed 
that none of its personnel were present when Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was 
taken into custody in Mexico or when he was placed on an aircraft bound for El 
Paso, where DEA agents arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
Although the DEA has not completed its investigation, Thornburgh said the 
agency made a preliminary report saying the "first encounter" its personnel had 
with Alvarez was when they took him into custody at the El Paso Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney general's statement did not deal with an allegation that 
Alvarez had been spirited away from his Guadalajara medical office April 2 by a 
team organized by a DEA informant and working for a $100,000 DEA bounty. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't speak to that issue," said Runkel, who issued Thornburgh's statement 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about the circumstances of Alvarez's apprehension produced a threat by 
Alvarez del Castillo to cut off Mexican law enforcement cooperation with U.S. 
drug enforcers and an unusually blunt warning by Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari that his nation would not tolerate violations of its laws or 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel said Thornburgh had assured Alvarez del Castillo in face-to-face 
meetings Thursday at an anti-drug conference in Ixtapa, Mexico, that he had 
"insisted upon a full, complete and immediate investigation into the 
circumstances" of Alvarez's apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh also assured his Mexican counterpart that "appropriate action would 
be forthcoming" after he receives a report on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles ordered federal 
law enforcement officials to explain at a May 25 hearing how Alvarez was 
brought to Los Angeles to face charges in the 1985 murder of DEA agent Enrique 
S. Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
When told of Rafeedie's order Friday, Runkel said he still foresaw no 
circumstances under which Alvarez would be returned to Mexico. Runkel had been 
en route back to Washington from Mexico with Thornburgh when the court acted. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources in Mexico and the United States, Alvarez's apprehension 
was orchestrated by Los Angeles-based DEA agents working for Operation Leyenda, 
a task force created to capture Camarena's killers. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's attorney, Robert K. Steinberg of Los Angeles, said at Thursday's 
court hearing that his client had been kidnaped from his office in Guadalajara 
by men who identified themselves as Mexican police and told him he was being 
arrested for performing an illegal abortion. The physician denied the abortion 
allegation, but he was taken into custody and flown to El Paso in a private 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said Alvarez told him that one of the six men on the plane identified 
himself as a DEA agent. The attorney said his client also told him that a 
person had gotten off the plane in El Paso and joined the DEA agents who 
arrested the physician. All the other men got back on the plane, which 
apparently flew back to Mexico, Alvarez told his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said Alvarez has consistently maintained in five interviews with 
Steinberg, DEA agents, DEA informants and others that while he was in the house 
where Camarena was murdered, he did not help keep the agent alive so that he 
could undergo further torture -- an allegation contained in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez told DEA agents that another physician, Dr. Juan Mejia Monte, was 
tending to Camarena at the house, according to a DEA report obtained by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said Mejia Monte has left Guadalajara but that Alvarez has told him 
the city in Mexico where he is now living and that he relayed that information 
early this week to the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles and to the Mexican 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked the Mexican government to produce this guy," Steinberg said. "I've 
been stonewalled." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of whether DEA agents took part in the alleged abduction of Alvarez 
in Mexico is important because of a controversial Justice Department legal 
finding, authorizing U.S. agents to apprehend a fugitive in a foreign country 
without that country's approval. 
</P>
<P>
After The Times disclosed the existence of that finding, the White House and 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III emphasized that no such action would be 
taken without high-level interagency consultation. FBI Director William S. 
Sessions and other officials have emphasized in congressional testimony that no 
operation of that type has been undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department sources said there was no such interagency consultation in 
Alvarez's case.

MILKEN TO PLEAD GUILTY TO FRAUD; 
</P>

PAY $600 MILLION IN PENALTIES. ACCORD ENDS ALL OTHER PROSECUTION.

<P>
Michael Milken, the man who created the market for junk bonds, abandoned a 
longstanding claim that he is not guilty of financial fraud and agreed Friday 
to plead guilty to six felony counts, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In a settlement that will end all other criminal prosecution of him, the former 
head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk bond operations in Beverly Hills also 
agreed to pay $600 million in financial penalties, people involved in the case 
said. The amount is believed to be by far the largest financial settlement ever 
by an individual in a criminal case. The settlement also resolves civil charges 
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Milken, 43, to settle was heavily influenced by a concession 
made in recent days by prosecutors: They agreed to drop all charges against his 
brother, Lowell, a former top aide to Milken at Drexel, sources said. Michael, 
Lowell and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg were named in a 98-count 
racketeering and securities fraud indictment pending sinceMarch, 1989. It was 
not clear how the agreement will affect Newberg. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which apparently will bring to an end the largest criminal 
securities fraud investigation ever undertaken by the federal government, is 
not expected to be announced officially until early next week. Lawyers were 
said to be still resolving minor details. Officials at both the U.S. Attorney's 
Office in Manhattan and the SEC refused to comment on the agreement, which will 
not go into effect until Milken enters his plea. 
</P>
<P>
A Milken spokesman also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Before committing himself to the settlement, Milken waited until virtually the 
last minute under a deadline set by prosecutors. Sources said he was told that 
he had to agree by Friday afternoon. Otherwise, a grand jury immediately would 
return a long-threatened "superseding" indictment that would have contained 
many additional felony charges and named additional defendants. Milken finally 
sent word that he would go along at mid-afternoon, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was the drop-dead date," a lawyer involved in the case said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had prepared to make good their threat by ordering the grand jury 
hearing the case into court on Friday, sources said. The grand jury normally 
meets only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how much prison time, if any, Milken will have to serve, 
although legal experts said it is very likely that he will be incarcerated. In 
the federal court system, prosecutors are not allowed to plea bargain on prison 
sentences, which are always left up to the judge. But the settlement is 
understood to include a promise that prosecutors will recommend that any prison 
sentences on the six counts be served concurrently. Legal experts said that the 
probable upper limit of a prison sentence would be five years. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement enables both sides to avoid what would have been an extremely 
lengthy and complicated trial. Sources close to Milken declined to comment 
immediately on his state of mind or the final chain of events that led to the 
agreement. The accord caps months of on-again, off-again negotiations behind 
the scenes between Milken's lawyers, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the SEC. 
The superseding indictment originally was to have been filed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Former prosecutors said the government's actions in the case, in which they 
allowed months to pass even though all evidence had been gathered for the 
superseding indictment, suggested that the government was unusually eager to 
settle the case. Jess Fardella, one of the lead prosecutors in the case, 
refused to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, however, was extremely reluctant to admit guilt and accept legal 
responsibility for a chain of events that included, among other things, the 
collapse of Drexel in February, when the firm's parent company filed bankruptcy 
proceedings. Drexel itself had agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts in 
December, 1988, and pay $650 million in penalties. That accord set the firm on 
a decline from which it never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's own legal advisers were said to have been divided on whether he should 
settle. 
</P>
<P>
Other criminal defense lawyers in New York said, however, that Milken's chances 
of winning in a trial were doubtful. About a dozen of his closest former 
colleagues and customers had agreed to testify against him in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution. Nearly all of the criminal securities fraud cases 
that had gone to juries in New York in the last two years ended with guilty 
verdicts. And Milken's defense lawyers were known to have been afraid that his 
wealth might have prejudiced jurors against him. He is said to have earned more 
than $1 billion at Drexel between 1983 and 1987, including $550 million in a 
single year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the six counts to which Milken has agreed to plead 
guilty will not include any racketeering or insider trading charges. They 
declined to specify, however, what the six counts are. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to ending the criminal case against him in federal court in New 
York, sources said the accord gives him immunity from other possible 
prosecution, such as in the current pending investigations of possible fraud at 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and CenTrust Savings Bank. Milken resigned from 
Drexel last June, after his indictment, and founded a new company to advise 
companies and minority groups on raising capital. 
</P>
<P>
Sources did not specify how the $600 million that Milken has agreed to forfeit 
will be broken down, between criminal fines and civil penalties. But they said 
the amount includes a provision for a special fund to pay successful claims in 
the many private civil lawsuits filed against Milken for his alleged illegal 
activities at Drexel. The $650-million penalty that Drexel paid also included 
such a fund. 
</P>
<P>
The government had pressured Milken to agree to pay a total of $650 million, as 
Drexel itself had. But Milken's lawyers countered that he already had been 
financially penalized as a result of the investigation and Drexel's collapse. 
Drexel never paid him the bonus and salary he was owed for 1988 and 1989, and 
he was never paid for the Drexel stock he was required to turn in when he was 
forced to resign from the company last June after his indictment. In all, he 
was said to have been owed about $200 million by Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if Milken will have to cooperate at all in any 
continuing investigations by the government. The issue of cooperation had been 
a major stumbling block in the negotiations. Prosecutors and SEC Chairman 
Richard C. Breeden were said to have insisted, at least until recently, that 
Milken share what he knows about several other figures currently under 
investigation. "I know Breeden really wanted him to cooperate," one lawyer 
involved in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the settlement was considered encouraging news by lawyers for several 
individuals who would have been named as defendants in the new indictment. It 
was expected that a settlement by Milken would remove the threat that their 
clients would be indicted, although their lawyers said they had not received 
any official word on that from the government. One of those expected to have 
been indicted was Warren Trepp, Drexel's head junk bond trader. His lawyer, 
William Hundley, declined to comment Friday. Trepp has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
It also was not clear what impact the settlement would have on Newberg, the 
former Drexel trader named in the original indictment. Fred Hafetz, one of his 
attorneys, said: "We'll just have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of Drexel and Milken began in 1986 when Ivan F. Boesky, a 
former stock speculator, reached a plea agreement with the government -- 
requiring him to plead guilty to one felony count and pay $100 million in 
penalties -- and began turning over incriminating information. 
</P>
<P>
The original indictment of Milken included counts of racketeering, racketeering 
conspiracy, insider trading, stock market manipulation and filing false 
statements with the SEC. That indictment rested heavily on information obtained 
from Boesky, a convicted felon, who prosecutors feared might not be thoroughly 
persuasive to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
But in the months after the indictment, the government brought intense pressure 
to bear on former Milken clients and co-workers. They are said to have given 
evidence of a wide variety of schemes unrelated to Boesky, including additional 
instances of insider trading, giving improper inducements to mutual fund 
managers to persuade them to invest in Drexel-issued junk bonds, tax fraud and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
One lawyer in the case said that, at least until earlier this week, the 
government was said to have insisted that Milken's brother plead guilty to at 
least one misdemeanor count. But Milken held firm that he would not consent to 
an agreement unless his brother was exempted from all prosecution. Lowell is 
said to have reached a settlement as well of the separate SEC charges pending 
against him. But it is believed that he will be able to retain most of the 
millions he earned while at Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Another lawyer involved in the case said it was not clear yet whether the 
agreement means that the Drexel investigation will completely end or whether 
the government will continue to pursue leads against others, including several 
big former Drexel clients. "I'd be reluctant to say this would be the end of 
the investigation," the lawyer said. "There are a lot of imponderables, and I 
just don't know where this (Milken's plea) could lead."

REYNOLDS RESIGNS AS CHANCELLOR; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: CAL STATE SYSTEM'S CHIEF, UNDER FIRE OVER PAY RAISES, WILL LEAVE 
OFFICE AT END OF THE YEAR.

<P>
W. Ann Reynolds tearfully resigned Friday as chancellor of the 20-campus 
California State University rather than face possible firing for her handling 
of controversial pay raises for herself and top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, her staff and the Board of Trustees that governs Cal State were under 
intense pressure from legislators and faculty to restore public confidence in 
what is the largest system of higher education in the nation. The 21% to 43% 
salary increases and secrecy surrounding them had created such a political and 
publicity disaster that the trustees rescinded the raises Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor, in the job since 1982, told an emergency meeting of trustees at 
the Oakland Airport Hilton hotel that her resignation would be effective at the 
end of the year but that she will take a leave starting Oct. 1. Executive Vice 
Chancellor Herbert L. Carter is to lead the 365,000-student system until a new 
chancellor is found. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds began to sob after reading to the trustees her resignation statement, 
which mainly listed her widely acknowledged successes in recruiting minority 
students and faculty and bolstering the system's academic standards. Her formal 
statement did not mention the salary controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Later, talking with reporters, she struggled to keep her composure as she said 
there was no direct link between her decision and the sharp rebukes she 
received from trustees during a special hearing Thursday about the raises. She 
said she had not been asked to resign but that she had been thinking of it for 
the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight years in one of these jobs is a long time. . . ," said Reynolds, 52. "I 
think it's my honest belief that it's time for another energetic person." 
</P>
<P>
However, most other knowledgeable sources described the resignation as a 
face-saving device for both Reynolds and the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than a vote of no confidence by the trustees, a better outcome was 
arranged," Ray Geigle, chairman of the systemwide Academic Senate, a faculty 
group, said Friday at the meeting. Eleven campus faculties recently passed 
their own resolutions of no confidence in Reynolds' administration and several 
more had been expected to follow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth O'Brien, executive director of the California Postsecondary Education 
Commission, said Friday that Reynolds had no choice but to resign because of 
criticism in Sacramento and among trustees. "Her ability to run the system 
faced problems and that was probably a detriment to the system," said O'Brien, 
whose organization advises the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Some Cal State insiders complained that Reynolds was a sacrificial lamb to 
appease angry legislators and that blame for the scandal should be shared by 
trustees and Reynolds' top aides. Some officials said that Caesar Naples, vice 
chancellor for faculty and staff relations, and Mayer Chapman, vice chancellor 
and general counsel, are in danger of losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, an ex officio trustee, attended Friday's meeting and 
stressed that trustees in closed session last September had authorized at least 
the general pattern of the Jan. 1 pay raises and delegated Reynolds and trustee 
chairwoman Marianthi Lansdale to formally decide specifics. McCarthy declined 
to comment on the resignation other than to say: "She's trying to leave the 
place with dignity and peace." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lansdale acknowledged for the first time that she was acting on 
explicit agreement among trustees when she gave Reynolds the 43% pay increase 
in a procedure designed to avoid scrutiny by employee unions. "We made a 
mistake," Lansdale said, pledging more open action in the future. 
</P>
<P>
However, several trustees, most vocally board Vice Chairman William J. 
Campbell, who headed the committees on personnel and collective bargaining, 
said they were given misleading information last fall by Reynolds' staff. 
Campbell, who is expected to become board chairman later this year, declined to 
comment Friday on Reynolds' departure. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, Reynolds -- dubbed Queen Ann by critics -- survived an attempt 
to oust her because of what some trustees called her autocratic ways and 
inattention to individual campuses. At that time, McCarthy and Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown helped her beat back the challenge. The position of executive vice 
chancellor was created to ease problems. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, Reynolds could not count on such influential aid. On Wednesday, 
Republicans and Democrats on the Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee on 
education unanimously called for a rollback in the pay raises and an audit of 
Cal State's administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, also an ex officio trustee, had no immediate reaction 
to Reynolds' move, according to press secretary Robert J. Gore. The governor's 
absence from Friday's meeting should not be seen as significant, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a zoologist with expertise in fetal development, Reynolds has the 
option to take a Cal State professorship that would allow her a year of 
research before returning to the classroom. She said she did not know what her 
new salary would be. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, she has been mentioned for university leadership posts outside 
California. Asked if she might look for one, she replied: "I think all options 
are open right now." Before becoming chancellor, she was provost at Ohio State 
University and a leading administrator at the University of Illinois' medical 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees voted unanimously Friday to rescind the Jan. 1 raises, which had 
boosted Reynolds' salary 43% from $136,248 last year to $195,000 and those of 
the six vice chancellors and 20 campus presidents 21% to 28%, to totals ranging 
from $130,000 to $150,000. Now their salaries will go up 4.18% from last 
year's, reflecting the average raise for faculty and other staff. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees promised to hold public discussions about whether executive pay at 
Cal State is not competitive nationally -- the contention of Reynolds' staff. 
Ironically, some officials noted, the chancellor's pay may wind up back near 
$195,000 to attract a replacement for Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
A search committee is to be established next week to fill what many educators 
say is a difficult assignment. Meanwhile, Carter will preside over the 
sprawling system. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was one of several vice chancellors when he was appointed by the 
trustees to serve as executive vice chancellor in 1987, after Reynolds' choice 
for chief deputy, William E. Vandament, left under criticism and returned to 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has worked in the Cal State system since he was hired as its affirmative 
action officer in 1974, coming from a post as head of the Los Angeles County 
Commission on Human Rights. He earned a doctorate in public administration from 
USC in 1979 and has served as a lecturer at several UC and Cal State campuses 
and private colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State system is enormous geographically -- and enormously complicated 
-- with a $2-billion annual budget and more than 20,000 teachers. Its 20 
campuses -- the latest, in San Marcos, is under construction -- all have 
different problems and some resent central control from the system's Long Beach 
headquarters. Humboldt State in the rural, mainly white north, for example, has 
very little in common with the urban, heavily Latino and Asian campus of Cal 
State Los Angeles. And Reynolds' plan for up to five additional campuses is 
much debated. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters, Cal State lives in the shadow of the more prestigious UC 
system. UC is research-oriented while Cal State's emphasis is on undergraduate 
education and teacher preparation. UC is constitutionally protected from much 
legislative interference while recent events show that Cal State is not. 
</P>
<P>
Edward R. Purcell, general manager of the faculty union, said Friday that the 
pay dispute was a symptom of "a hidebound bureaucracy which basically thinks 
it's above the law and . . . would like to be running a private institution." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was "unfortunate" that Reynolds was singled out for blame, 
especially since her union relations had improved recently. 
</P>
<P>
Very damaging to Reynolds was the disclosure that she had promised legislators 
in 1984 that future actions on executive pay would be in public. At Thursday's 
hearing, Reynolds said she had forgotten about that earlier pledge and 
apologized. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees also said they hadn't known until recently that, in addition to her 
salary, Reynolds earned more than $90,000 last year by serving on corporate 
boards. In addition, Cal State was much criticized for using nearly $100,000 
from an employees' benefits fund surplus to buy new cars, with take-home 
privileges, for the vice chancellors. Those privileges were revoked last month.

Greek customs officials have seized a huge cylinder that Iraq ordered from 
Britain for an artillery system, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came seven days after Britain seized a shipment of steel tubes 
that it said Iraq had ordered to make an enormous gun for firing missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials in Greece's western port of Patras on Thursday seized a 
British truck that "was conveying to Iraq a part of an artillery system 
weighing 29.5 tons," the Finance Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
It said documents listed the cargo as a copper cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
Sotirios Sotiriou, Patras' chief customs official, said the truck was carrying 
a 17-foot-long cylinder with a base for connecting it to a gun carriage. 
</P>
<P>
Sotiriou said the man who was driving the truck, Paul Ashwell, 25, of 
Northampton, England, was arrested and that he will be charged with illegally 
importing arms into Greece. 
</P>
<P>
On April 11, British officials seized eight steel tubes on the Middlesbrough 
docks in England. They said the tubes were parts for a gun that would be 130 
feet long.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comandante Tomas Borge, the hard-line Sandinista who heads Nicaragua's powerful 
security police, pledged Friday to support a peaceful turnover of the 
government next week to the pro-American coalition that upset his party in 
national elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting April 25, this institution will be subordinated to a new government 
and a new minister," Borge said of the Interior Ministry he has directed, in an 
emotional farewell to his troops. "This implies a difficult test for you, but 
you must face it with discipline, professionalism and strict adherence to the 
law and the constitution." 
</P>
<P>
The comandante's speech, his first in public since his government lost the Feb. 
25 election, dispelled any fear of high-level Sandinista resistance to the 
opposition's accession to power. Borge, the sole surviving founder of the 
29-year-old revolutionary movement, is considered the most rigid member of its 
nine-man directorate. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks came a day after the Sandinista army and President-elect Violeta 
Barrios de Chamorro's advisers reached agreements with Contra leaders formally 
ending the eight-year-old Nicaraguan war and obliging the U.S.-backed rebels to 
disarm by June 10. 
</P>
<P>
Borge said the accords proved the "ethical purposes and healthy intentions" of 
some of the incoming government's leaders and removed any pretext for 
challenging them with labor unrest, as some Sandinista-led unions have 
threatened. He urged striking bank clerks, telephone workers and miners to 
return to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Make your best efforts, as I am doing, to assure that Mrs. Chamorro takes 
possession (of the presidency)," he told hundreds of police officers and combat 
troops in an hourlong outdoor ceremony. "Let me warn you against disobedience, 
insubordination and disrespect." 
</P>
<P>
The message was a stark contrast to pre-election statements by Borge and other 
military leaders that their troops would never obey orders from any government 
that tried to dismiss Sandinista commanders. Borge once declared that Nicaragua 
would become "ungovernable" under a Chamorro administration. 
</P>
<P>
While calling his impending dismissal a "painful moment," Borge said it would 
be irresponsible of him "to ask you to leave the country's new leaders 
unprotected, to let flames reduce their homes to ashes, to make life impossible 
by promoting disorder. Never, under any circumstances, can you expect such 
advice from me." 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, however, that a failure by the Contras to meet their disarmament 
deadline would "completely change the rules of the game." And he spoke of 
"ethical challenges" in which police officers might have to "defend (the 
Chamorro government) against its own possible sins of delinquency, corruption 
and abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Borge, a spellbinding orator with a gift for poetic imagery, moved many in his 
audience to tears when he vowed that the "blood of our martyrs is like a seed 
that will flourish again someday, even more beautifully, in this revolutionary 
land" and that the "darkness" of previous dictatorships "will never return . . 
. because we have enough reserves of light." 
</P>
<P>
He called his secret police "the best sons of the fatherland" and boasted of 
how they had "outsmarted the CIA" to prevent the Contras from gaining a 
foothold in the cities. He noted with pride that his forces never used gunfire 
and rarely used tear gas to break up political disturbances, and that Managua 
"is one of the safest cities in the world." 
</P>
<P>
"They accuse me of having a hard hand, but people closest to me know that is 
not the nature of my heart," he said. He denied being corrupt, trafficking in 
drugs, owning a valuable art collection or planning to live in exile. "The 
doctors who have examined me say I am healthy enough for a long life, so don't 
have any illusions that I'll soon leave this world," he declared.

<TEXT>
<P>
Palestinian guerrilla leader Ahmed Jibril, a prime suspect in the 1988 bombing 
of Pan American Flight 103, has been hobbled by twisting loyalties that 
threaten full control of his radical organization, diplomatic and intelligence 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of dissension in the top circles of Jibril's Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command have been circulating for weeks in 
Syria, where the group has been based since its formation in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble revolves around the group's growing reliance on Iranian sources to 
fund its military operations, according to intelligence analysts in Damascus 
and in Washington. Meanwhile, the organization is under close watch by its 
Syrian hosts, who have been stung by association with the December, 1988, 
terrorist bombing that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
killing 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Investigation into the bombing continues, and no charges have been made in the 
British courts. However, a trail of evidence has been traced to known 
operatives of Jibril's group. According to American officials, the Damascus 
government has pledged not to tolerate any acts of terrorism by Syrian-based 
guerrilla groups and to "punish" anyone who is accused on convincing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no direct Syrian move against Jibril, who is also known 
as Abu Jihad, and his estimated 500 guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," said a Damascus-based diplomat of reports that the 
Palestinian radical has moved his base of operations from the outskirts of the 
Syrian capital to Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has been Jibril's main sponsor since he founded his guerrilla command. 
The Jaffa-born Palestinian was trained in the Syrian army and helped lead the 
Syrian-backed Palestinian radical revolt against Yasser Arafat's mainline Fatah 
guerrillas in Lebanon in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But intelligence sources inside Syria and abroad say that Jibril's command of 
his organization has been challenged over the issue of the divided sponsorships 
of Syria and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"Syria has less hold over Jibril than at any point since his 1983 split with 
Arafat," a top American counterterrorism official said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Jibril has denied published reports that his guerrillas masterminded and 
carried out the Pan Am bombing and that he received money from Iranian sources 
who wanted retaliation for the felling of an Iranian airliner over the Persian 
Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War by a U.S. missile cruiser that mistakenly 
targeted the airliner as an F-14 jet. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, sources in Damascus and Washington said Jibril is receiving money 
from Iran, although conceding it is not clear which faction in the Tehran 
government, or outside it, is providing the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's following the Iranian agenda," said a Damascus-based diplomat. "He's the 
man chosen to carry out Iran's dirty tricks." 
</P>
<P>
Jibril's funding formerly came from Syria and Libya, but both countries have 
cut back on bankrolling outside radicals in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"His leaning toward Tehran appears to be mainly linked to the financial issue," 
said an American analyst. "(Libyan leader Moammar) Kadafi has cut back 
seriously on his funding." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jibril poses a political and public relations problem for the 
government of Syrian President Hafez Assad. Commenting on Jibril's reported 
absences from Damascus, a State Department official in Washington speculated 
that Assad is trying to squeeze Jibril from power "to get rid of the albatross 
of Pan Am 103." 
</P>
<P>
With Syria on notice that ever-increasing military support from the Soviet 
Union is no longer available, and with its own economy staggering, Assad's 
government has taken a more moderate line in recent months. It has 
re-established relations with Egypt and put out economic feelers to the West, 
including the United States. Jibril and his radical Iranian connections are 
drags on the new image. 
</P>
<P>
Within the group, according to Damascus sources, the contending power is Talal 
Najy, an East Bloc-educated Palestinian with administrative skills and a firm 
loyalty to Syria. In late February, according to Washington reports, a split of 
the executive committee was averted only when Najy was given control of the 
political apparatus of the guerrilla command, leaving Jibril to handle military 
operations. Syrian sources confirmed an informal division of powers. 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat said that Najy was reported considering the diversion of 
the group's resources to Iranian objectives, as opposed to basic anti-Israeli 
activities, a serious policy change. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, however, are keeping their differences "under the surface," said a 
well-informed Syrian observer. Both appeared last week at the Yarmouk refugee 
camp outside Damascus to mark the anniversary of the founding of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. 
</P>
<P>
Jibril took the occasion to blister Arafat and threaten unspecified political 
targets. The PFLP-GC, he pledged, "will continue its operations, and this will 
be shown in the very near future." 
</P>
<P>
Williams reported from Damascus and Wright from Washington.

SOLIDARITY VOTE OF CONFIDENCE GIVEN TO WALESA

Lech Walesa won an overwhelming vote of confidence from Solidarity's second 
national congress Friday after delivering an impassioned defense of his 10 
years as union leader, angrily rejecting accusations that he ran the 
organization like a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not the wisest guy, but we are wise because we now have a democracy," 
Walesa said, reminding his critics that under his leadership, the union 
spearheaded Poland's successful drive toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech, Walesa acknowledged mistakes had been made. 
</P>
<P>
"The victory I am giving you. The mistakes are ours and you should correct all 
the mistakes we've made here and today," he said. "I did this only for Poland. 
. . . It's not my victory, it's our mutual victory. I was only the driver of it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
His voice shaking, Walesa recalled the moment when he jumped the shipyard wall 
in 1980 to lead the strike triggering the rise of Solidarity, the East Bloc's 
first free trade union. 
</P>
<P>
"You liked my jump over the wall, and you elected me to drive the vehicle 
called Solidarity," he said. "If I obeyed some of you, then I would have 
crashed the vehicle. I had no time for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa pointed out that the union had to operate under martial law imposed on 
Dec. 13, 1981, by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, now Poland's president, with 
thousands of activists jailed. He said quick Solidarity decisions by one leader 
were needed. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates responded by voting 357-1 to endorse Walesa's leadership by approving 
a report summarizing the union's activities during that time. There were 22 
abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates also unanimously passed a resolution backing Lithuania's 
declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
"The congress supports the decision of independence of March 11," the 
resolution said. "We call on all nations and governments to recognize this 
declaration of independence. We hope that soon Europe will be the home of free 
nations." 
</P>
<P>
The Solidarity delegates then gave a standing ovation to Lithuanian deputy 
Czeslaw Okinczyc, who was attending as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Okinczyc said Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki had 
promised unspecified economic aid to Lithuania, which is confronting a 
Soviet-imposed cutoff of oil supplies and cuts in natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to support Walesa came on the eve of his expected bid to be reelected 
Solidarity's chairman. The trade union movement also was expected to try to 
clarify its union and political roles in Poland's Solidarity-controlled 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's reelection appeared virtually certain.

HOAX OR NOT, BOOK ON GARBO TO BE PUBLISHED 
</P>

<P>
A press-ready memoir of Greta Garbo that had been locked in a vault for 14 
years will be released in a matter of weeks, Simon &amp; Schuster announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The biography, entitled "Garbo" and written by the late Polish emigre author 
Antoni Gronowicz, had been branded a hoax by the actress in 1978. At the time, 
Gronowicz said Garbo didn't want the book published out of fear it would damage 
her reputation because it contained details of her sexual encounters with some 
of the world's most famous personalities. "She is trying to destroy me," he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
The publishing house made no mention of the decade-old literary controversy on 
Friday. Simon &amp; Schuster's said "much" of the book being published in June 
is "told in her (Garbo's) own words as she talked to Gronowicz in the course of 
their long and intimate friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Gronowicz, who died in 1985, had said that he had known Garbo since 1938 and 
had had "many" interviews with her. 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster said it acquired the book in 1976 "on the understanding 
that it would not be published during the actress' lifetime. Simon &amp; 
Schuster insisted on this condition out of respect for Miss Garbo and her 
wishes." 
</P>
<P>
The actress, who died a week ago, had issued a sworn affadavit through her 
lawyer in 1978 stating "categorically" that she had never authorized or 
collaborated with Gronowicz on the account of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Richard E. Snyder, the president of Simon &amp; Schuster, responded at the time 
that his company would not publish the book "if we learn (it) is not what it 
purports to be. But we won't be denied the right to publish a literary work 
about a public personality because that person wants to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
The Gronowicz book will beat by more than a year two other books in the works 
on Garbo: a biography by Barry Paris for Alfred E. Knopf and a remembrance by 
Ray Daum for Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
According to the publisher, the memoir describes in detail Garbo's childhood in 
Sweden, her memories of movie stardom and her love life. Among the people 
discussed are her discoverer, mentor and lover Mauritz Stiller, actors John 
Gilbert, Robert Montgomery, Robert Taylor, Charles Boyer and Melvyn Douglas as 
well as conductor Leopold Stokowski, millionaire George Schlee, diet guru 
Gayelord Hauser and photographer Cecil Beaton. 
</P>
<P>
"In the book, Gronowicz also recalls Miss Garbo talking about the often rumored 
fact that 'women pursued (her) more often and more persistently' than did men," 
according to a Simon &amp; Schuster statement released Friday.

SUNDAY SCHOOL LIFTS BAN ON AIDS PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A church that had barred an AIDS-afflicted child from attending Sunday school 
reversed its decision Friday after publicity over the ban sparked a community 
uproar. 
</P>
<P>
The foster parents of the 5-year-old boy, who is being called Joey, were asked 
two weeks ago to stop bringing the child to Sunday school because several 
parents were concerned that their children might acquire the disease through 
contact with the boy, said the Rev. Irwin Lutzer, pastor of the Moody Memorial 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
But Lutzer said that the church had decided to allow Joey to attend Sunday 
school at the church. Parents upset over his attendance "have the freedom to 
keep their children from attending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to state categorically, lest we be misunderstood, that here at the 
Moody Church everyone is welcome," he said at an afternoon press conference. 
"We love Joey and we want him in our Sunday school and Joey will be in our 
Sunday school." 
</P>
<P>
A small group of protesters marched in the rain in front of the church as 
Lutzer announced the new decision. They chanted slogans such as "Fight AIDS, 
not people with AIDS" and carried signs that read: "Remember Ryan White." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan White was the AIDS patient who was refused admission to his Indiana school 
and whose subsequent fight against bigotry captured the heart of the nation. He 
died of complications from AIDS April 8, which was about the time that Walt and 
Terry Rucker were asked to stop bringing Joey to Sunday school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased that they reversed themselves. . . . I don't feel any bitterness," 
Terry Rucker told the Associated Press. She said she had not decided whether to 
return to the nondenominational evangelical church on Sunday. "I have made no 
plans to go elsewhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lutzer said Friday that the decision to bar Joey had been made before Ryan 
White's death brought about a resurgence in publicity over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
After Joey had been brought to Sunday school several times, parents expressed 
concern and the Ruckers were asked to stop bringing the boy temporarily while 
the church developed a policy, Lutzer said. Joey, who was born with the 
disease, was not barred from attending church services. 
</P>
<P>
Lutzer said the decision to allow the child to attend Sunday school would shift 
the burden of dealing with the issue away from the church and to the individual 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
He said that personally he would not have concerns about his child attending 
Sunday school with Joey because "I do think that the preponderance of the 
evidence is that (AIDS) cannot be communicated casually. So to me it would not 
be as big as deal as it is to other people." 
</P>
<P>
AIDS is spread by a virus transmitted mainly through sexual intercourse, shared 
hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during 
birth. Health officials have said there has been no evidence that it can spread 
by casual contact. 
</P>
<P>
Joey was the second person with AIDS that the Ruckers have taken into their 
home. Lutzer on Friday praised the couple: "Walt and Terry Rucker represent the 
type of Christian compassion and love that we would want to see . . . We could 
only wish that there were more people in our congregation who would do the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Grant Anderson, Christian education administrator at the church, said that the 
church's executive committee still had not formally approved the decision to 
allow AIDS-afflicted children to attend Sunday school. Before that vote is 
taken, church officials will continue to review literature on AIDS and possibly 
will meet with health experts.

AIR FORCE DISCOVERS B-2 BOMBER CRACKS

The Air Force said Friday it has discovered "hairline cracking" in a rear 
section of the B-2 Stealth bomber that may be caused by exposure to high 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
The exact reason for the cracking, found during a routine inspection of the 
radar-evading aircraft on March 30, is still under study, said Air Force 
spokesman Maj. Dick Cole. 
</P>
<P>
The cracking is located in the aft deck of the plane behind its engine exhaust 
outlets. The problem was first reported in the magazine Aviation Week &amp; 
Space Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that the sections with the cracking will be removed and replaced with 
new titanium patches. 
</P>
<P>
Titanium, which is highly heat resistant and is very strong, also was used in 
the now-retired reconnaisance aircraft SR-71. However, there are shortages of 
the material plaguing the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said it wasn't clear whether the problem would delay the plane's testing 
process.

FBI PROBES FIREBOMBING OF NUCLEAR INSPECTOR'S HOME

The FBI said Friday that it has entered the investigation into the suspected 
firebombing of the home of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's chief inspector 
at the troubled Sequoyah Nuclear Plant. 
</P>
<P>
The fire gutted the home of NRC senior inspector Ken Jenison on Thursday after 
he received four threatening phone calls, commission spokesman Ken Clark said. 
Jenison then discovered that his car had been sabotaged as he left the plant to 
go to his burning home, Clark said. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC said it believes the fire was in retaliation for Jenison's work at the 
nuclear power plant, and labeled it the worst violence against an inspector in 
the federal regulatory agency's history. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a rather intensive investigation going," said William Baugh, special 
agent in charge of the FBI in Knoxville. "Every agent in the southern part of 
the state is working on this." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton County sheriff's officials labeled the fire "suspicious in origin," 
until the investigation is complete. A smashed window led investigators to 
conclude that the home might have been firebombed. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI refused to comment on whether any suspects had been identified. Another 
NRC inspector at Sequoyah said authorities suspect disgruntled former employees 
of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns the plant near Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
"From the nature of the threatening phone calls, it sounded like the caller was 
upset that he had lost his job because of some of the things Ken had done," NRC 
inspector Paul Harmon said. "But there's nothing he's done that we could point 
to. This is kind of out of the blue to us." The TVA, which has been cutting 
costs to control electric rates, announced in March that it will lay off 230 
employees at Sequoyah, a twin-reactor plant plagued by safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
The plant was closed four years for safety problems until 1988. Last week, the 
NRC staff proposed fining the TVA $75,000 for two safety violations at 
Sequoyah, and $240,000 for allegedly harassing whistle blowers who raised 
safety concerns at its Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, which is under construction at 
Spring City, Tenn.

Jenison received two threatening phone calls at home Wednesday evening and two 
more at the plant Thursday before the fire at his house five miles away, 
officials said. His wife and two children were not home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's caller reportedly told Jenison that his house would be burned, and 
he started for home when a neighbor phoned to report the fire, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that when he left the plant to get in his car to go see about his 
home, he noticed that on one wheel of the car, one lug nut was missing and 
three were loose," Clark said.

RACKETEER WHO BLINDED FINANCIER GETS 33 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles racketeer Michael Anthony Rizzitello, a reputed underboss in the 
Milano organized crime family, was sentenced to 33 years in prison Friday for 
shooting and blinding an Orange County topless bar financier. 
</P>
<P>
C. William Carroll, shot three times in the head while in a Costa Mesa parking 
garage in 1987, told Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. before the 
sentencing in Santa Ana, "I can't see justice done, but I can hear it. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to hear it today." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that Rizzitello, 62, tried to kill Carroll, 58, because 
he saw him as a roadblock in the racketeer's attempt to take over the 
now-defunct Mustang Club on Harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello has a long history of racketeering-related arrests and convictions. 
He was one of five people convicted in Los Angeles in 1980 in a major federal 
organized crime case for which he received a five-year prison term. But he had 
also been acquitted in three major cases since then -- two involving fraud 
charges and one involving a possible attempt to kill a government witness. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn sentenced Rizzitello to 25 years to life in prison for conspiracy to 
commit first-degree murder. He then added three years for great bodily injury 
to Carroll, two years for use of a firearm and another three years because 
Rizzitello was a convicted felon with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans told the court that it was 
"a miracle that this was not a completed execution. There's no doubt that when 
the Legislature set up this kind of sentence for this crime, it was with 
someone like (Rizzitello) in mind."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY SIGNS ORDINANCE TO PROTECT HISTORIC 
ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley signed an ordinance Thursday to protect the historic 
architectural nature of a residential neighborhood north of the Miracle Mile 
shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
"Miracle Mile North is the home of hundreds of irreplaceable examples of the 
architecture that characterized Los Angeles from the mid-1920s to early 1940s," 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said at a signing ceremony in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the council voted 14 to 0 to approve the ordinance setting 
up the special district in an area bounded by Beverly Boulevard on the north, 
La Brea Avenue on the east, 3rd Street on the south and Gardner Street on the 
west.

ZINMAN JOINS PHILHARMONIC'S LONG PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Philharmonic season is lumbering to a close. The ultimate 
cadence on April 29 may not come a hemidemisemiquaver too soon. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a season of much activity, much strain and much unrest. It has 
been a season without the stabilizing presence of a music director. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Previn, who returns for the final program next week, abandoned the post 
loudly and sadly when he felt that he could not work with the Philharmonic 
management. Esa-Pekka Salonen, his successor, remains an essentially mysterious 
figure looming on the distant horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Until he really takes over, our orchestral fortunes languish in the hands of 
guest-conductors. It has been a long, uneven parade. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, the baton was passed to David Zinman of the Baltimore Symphony. 
He became the 16th conductor to man the podium at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
since October, and the fourth in four weeks to contend with the rigors of a 
one-week stand. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, he is a thorough and seasoned professional. Nothing goes seriously 
wrong when he is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Unluckily, he is not the sort of leader who inspires the orchestra to new 
interpretive heights at short notice. Nor is he the sort of technician who can 
repair a deteriorating ensemble over night. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the first half of this concert accompanying Pinchas Zukerman in a 
contrasting pair of concertos -- a very old one by Mozart and a very new one by 
Mark Neikrug. After intermission, he attended to the folksy impulses and 
climactic bombast of Tchaikovsky's "Little Russian" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
As a cruel fate and a tired orchestra would have it, the only really 
interesting item on the agenda turned out to be the Neikrug concerto, which was 
receiving its West Coast premiere. Written in 1982 when the composer was 36, it 
documents a sometimes abrasive, sometimes ethereal, sometimes inarticulate 
conversation between a virtuoso fiddle and an agitated orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Although the language relies upon certain serial procedures, tonal centers are 
seldom obscured. Neikrug seems occasionally to succumb to the gnarled formulas 
of academic busy-music. He can sustain flights of elegiac lyricism, however, 
and he is a master of the whomping climax. The concerto covers a lot of ground 
in 21 compact minutes. Zukerman played it with dynamic generosity and startling 
flexibility, not to mention expressive conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The expressive conviction proved particularly welcome after his performance of 
Mozart's A-major Concerto. It was vaguely romantic in (mis)conception, 
essentially lethargic in execution. 
</P>
<P>
Zinman and the orchestra provided an untidy frame for the Mozart. They went on 
to furnish the soloist with an apparently competent counterforce in the 
Neikrug. 
</P>
<P>
The precision factor rose appreciably in the Tchaikovsky symphony. Here, the 
conductor could at least enforce crisp phrasing and primitive contrasts. He 
could be blamed only partially for the gut-thumping vulgarity of the finale.

VERMEER QUARTET, GOLABEK CLOSE GUILD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was little doubt as to what the Vermeer String Quartet brought to the 
Wilshire Ebell Theatre on Wednesday night. In this final program in the Music 
Guild's 1989-90 season, the Chicago-based ensemble offered dignity, grace and 
refinement. What they did not bring -- initially, at least -- was a sense of 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
The program began with an extremely polished account of Mozart's Quartet in A, 
K. 464. And although the veteran ensemble exhibited first-rate control and 
faultless rhythmic unity, the four displayed little sense of urgency and 
allowed Mozart to emerge cool, even sterile. 
</P>
<P>
Each musician produced an elegant, suave tone, free of edginess, and the 
combined sound proved pure and resonant. Yet rarely did any of the four give 
palpable shape to melodic lines; much of the time the music simply stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
After Mozart, the foursome (violinists Shmuel Ashkenasi and Pierre Menard, 
violist Richard Young and cellist Marc Johnson) gave a gentlemanly account of 
Shostakovich's Fourth Quartet, keeping dynamics -- and audience members' 
heartbeats -- at moderate levels. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't exactly vitiate the work -- playing this precise, this refined is 
all but impossible to admire -- but, aside from the climactic C-major section 
in the final movement, the music displayed little of the bite and energy that 
it can. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, pianist Mona Golabek joined the four string players in 
offering Schumann's Quintet in E-flat, Opus 44. Whether or not it was the 
pianist's presence, something energized the ensemble, for the music making 
became more vital and more exciting. Here the players exercised arching 
lyricism, expressive nuances and considerably more dynamic variety. 
</P>
<P>
Balances, on the whole, remained equitable, but string players often failed 
sufficiently to bring out important melodic lines. Ashkenasi exhibited a 
surprising reluctance to soar, as if he were afraid of over-dominating. 
Moreover, rapid-note passages, such as those found in the Scherzo, occasionally 
dogged this performance. TERRY McQUILKIN

THE JAM SESSION THAT NEVER MATERIALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine the jam session you could have if you got a few Beach Boys, Mama 
Michelle Phillips, Jan Berry of Jan &amp; Dean and legendary producer Phil 
Spector together with the "Wrecking Crew" session musicians who played on most 
of their great recordings, all reunited for the first time in ages in a tiny 
club. 
</P>
<P>
That was the scene Thursday at the Baked Potato, site of a private party 
honoring the publication of a memoir by drummer Hal Blaine, who provided 
signature beats to many of the top Los Angeles recording sessions in the '60s 
and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
But imagination was, for the most part, what the family and friends on hand 
were left with. Only after a couple hours of spirited but standard jazz fusion 
led by "Wrecking Crew" keyboardist (and club proprietor) Don Randi (and a 
"special" appearance by an Elvis imitator) did Blaine finally take the 
drummer's chair. Beach Boys Bruce Johnston and Al Jardine were then coaxed on 
stage for a room-enlivening round of "Help Me Rhonda." Sure it was sloppy, but 
it was also magical. 
</P>
<P>
It was also too little too late. Berry and Beach Boy mastermind Brian Wilson 
had already split by this time, Phillips couldn't be persuaded to join in, and 
of course there had never really been any hope that the reclusive Spector would 
step into the spotlight. But at least it supported Johnston's stage comment 
that in the age of electronically sampled sounds, "these characters are missing 
from the radio. Live players really make it happen." STEVE HOCHMAN

STRAZZERI BACK TO HIS BOP ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When left to his own devices, pianist/composer Frank Strazzeri -- an adaptive 
fellow who has backed everyone from Chet Baker and Stan Getz to Elvis Presley 
-- most always returns to the be-bop-based jazz that has long been the 
foundation of his craft. That was how it was Wednesday at St. Mark's in Venice, 
where the compact, soft-spoken artist led a first-rate quintet in a "live" 
recording session for the Fresh Sounds label of Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The six tunes that made up the unpretentious but rewarding opening set were 
democratically chosen: there were three alluring Strazzeri originals at various 
tempi, two jazz classics -- Tadd Dameron's "On a Misty Night" and Kenny 
Dorham's "Una Mas" -- and the winsome standard, "They Say It's Wonderful." All 
were deftly arranged and orchestrated, and featured the frontline of 
saxophonist Bill Perkins and trombonist Thurman Green, men whose dusky, glowing 
tones made the leader's harmonized lines come quietly alive. The horns received 
crisp support from Strazzeri, bassist Pat Senatore and drummer Joe LaBarbera. 
(The latter -- known for his work with pianist Bill Evans -- was on a brief 
leave from backing singer Tony Bennett). 
</P>
<P>
Strazzeri's Bud Powell-tinged solos, delivered with a ringing, even touch, 
flowed as he went from one interesting idea to another, usually packing these 
statements with a rhythmic punch that made the music move. His gentle and 
graceful approach on "Misty Night," a lovely concoction, mirrored the spirit of 
the tune, and on the swiftly-moving "Peaceful Moments," he offered intricate 
stuff with articulation and backbone. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins and Green provided pleasing improvisational diversity. The tenorman, 
who established himself with Stan Kenton in the '50s, often roared forth with 
an edgy modernity that made one think of Wayne Shorter, skipping from cascading 
scales to pole-vault-like leaps on "Moments" and "Journey to the East." Green, 
a devotee of J.J. Johnson but clearly his own man, used statements of a smaller 
scope to tell his stories in a more subtle, but nonetheless compelling, manner. 
</P>
<P>
Senatore and LaBarbera pushed and prodded the band, adding excitement and 
flavor throughout. ZAN STEWART

ANOTHER BATCH OF 'TALES FROM THE CRYPT' ON HBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As perhaps the first television series ever to have every one of its episodes 
based on a comic book, HBO's "Tales From the Crypt" has its built-in 
limitations. The lessons in the old comics' horrific morality tales weren't 
especially sophisticated ones -- mostly limited to be careful what you wish 
for, you just might get it, or he who lives by the pickax dies by the pickax 
and that sort of thing -- and a modern audience virtually weaned on clever 
twists can see the O. Henry-style denouements coming a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
That established, the series does leave ample room to have stylistic fun with 
the creaky, campy material, when the directors -- usually established Hollywood 
names happily slumming in cable land -- are willing and able. The second batch 
of original episodes gets kicked off tonight at 9:30 with a new trilogy of 
"Tales," all of which are indisputably of theatrical quality, if not 
necessarily good repute. 
</P>
<P>
First up is director Howard Deutch's "Dead Right," which gives Demi Moore a 
plum role as a waitress who happens upon a fortune teller with dead-accurate 
advice. The fun here is not so much in the tale, which has Moore marrying a 
grotesque slob predicted to inherit a fortune, as in the telling -- 
specifically Moore's sharp, funny characterization of a working girl who works 
mostly at developing a premature-yup attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched in the middle is the weakest link, "The Switch," in which, in his 
directorial debut, Arnold Schwarzenegger (!) tells a competent tale but fails 
to coax much of a performance out of Rick Rossovich, Kelly Preston or even 
William Hickey. Speaking of O. Henry, the plot, which has elderly Hickey 
spending his vast fortune to buy up new body parts in order to win a young 
woman, may remind you more than a little of "Gift of the Magi." Passable, it 
could've used a helmsman better equipped to directorially pump (clap) it up. 
</P>
<P>
Last -- and best, at least for students of the auteur school -- is "Cutting 
Cards," in which director and co-writer Walter Hill ("48 HRS," "Southern 
Comfort") reaches the possible apotheosis of his modern-machismo-in-decline 
themes. Two obsessive gamblers converge in a town they conclude ain't big 
enough for the both of 'em; a series of wagers escalates to squeamish extremes. 
Once more, but in more comic fashion, Hill both celebrates and condemns this 
ridiculously unbending ethic. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the animatronic Crypt Keeper's introductory admonitions to "kiddies" are 
strictly rhetorical. None of this tongue-in-skull material is at all scary, but 
the violence and language are unflinchingly R-rated, and the series' penchant 
for setting scenes in topless-dancer bars is bare-facedly exploitative. CHRIS 
WILLMAN

BIG NAMES, FEW SPARKS ON 'COAST TO COAST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The star-struck concept behind the new episode of Showtime's "Coast to Coast" 
series (airing for the first time tonight at 10) doesn't sound that great on 
paper, and makes even less sense on the screen. Producer-director-writer Ken 
Ehrlich crammed the China Club stage with a bunch of big names on the day after 
the Grammys, apparently assuming that sparks would automatically fly. 
</P>
<P>
But the only real revelations are a singer-drummer named Vinx, and Sting's big 
hoop earring. 
</P>
<P>
With bulky blues Buddha B.B. King serving as musical and visual anchor, and 
with host Herbie Hancock decreasing the excitement with every sputtering 
introduction, a parade of familiar faces comes and goes: Bonnie Raitt, Bruce 
Hornsby, Michael Bolton. Only Lou Reed and Rickie Lee Jones stand out from the 
pack, and the overcrowded jams yield few precious moments. When the finale 
spotlights actors (Michael J. Fox, Michael Keaton), "Coast to Coast" goes down 
around Barstow. RICHARD CROMELIN

RICK DU BROW: ABC NO. 1? THE DREAM EDGES TOWARD REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's as simple as ABC. From sunup to sundown, and into prime time, ABC 
Television is on the rise in both news and entertainment -- the network to 
watch as the 1990s get under way. 
</P>
<P>
Already cheered for such ventures as "Roseanne," "The Wonder Years" and "Twin 
Peaks," ABC is in fact cutting a much wider swath through the competition. Both 
its wake-up show, "Good Morning America," and Peter Jennings' evening wrap-up, 
"World News Tonight," have totally dominated the opposition on NBC and CBS 
since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
As TV's official ratings season ended this week, ABC was still second to NBC in 
prime time -- but it was also the only one of the Big Three networks that 
didn't experience an audience decline from the previous year. Its median viewer 
age, 37, was preferable to sponsors over those of NBC (40) and CBS (45). 
</P>
<P>
And ABC's dreams of toppling NBC in the next few years didn't seem so wild with 
"America's Funniest Home Videos" turning into a runaway hit and -- a big 
question mark -- Oprah Winfrey, the unbeatable daytime star, ready in the wings 
with her new series, "Brewster Place." It debuts on ABC during the May ratings 
sweeps that begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While ABC has a battle royal on its hands against NBC in prime time, it is 
simply running away from the competition in the prestigious races for 
morning-show and nightly news domination. "Good Morning America," already on 
the rise as last year drew to a close, was positioned perfectly to take the 
lead when NBC, in one of the dumbest executive decisions in TV memory, 
virtually forced Jane Pauley into resigning from the "Today" program by 
showcasing Deborah Norville as her obvious successor.

<P>
"Today" now has lost to "Good Morning America" in the ratings every week this 
year -- in short, since Pauley quit and Norville replaced her. "Today" is also 
losing viewers steadily, and because of the incomprehensible move to break up a 
show that didn't need fixing in the first place, NBC reportedly is facing a 
drop in income from the series as well. 
</P>
<P>
With ABC's Charles Gibson and Joan Lunden comfortably in place as hosts of 
"Good Morning America," NBC and "Today" may need at least several years to win 
viewers over to the new team of Bryant Gumbel and Norville, if past patterns of 
this competition hold firm. And if Gumbel or Norville should leave "Today," it 
could take longer and make ABC's lead all the more secure. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening news competition, Jennings undoubtedly is benefitting from the 
fact that ABC's prime-time shows and overall reputation are stronger than those 
of last-place CBS, where his competitor, Dan Rather, has also suddenly 
plummeted from the lead. Furthermore, ABC's growing prestige as network TV's 
finest and deepest news organization -- with such other names as Ted Koppel, 
David Brinkley and Barbara Walters -- has certainly also helped Jennings surge 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening now is that ABC is seeing, on a vast scale, the 
coming-together of the efforts over the years of three executives who helped 
turn the network from a cellar-dwelling joke to an organization now poised to 
lord it over all of TV if it can finally unseat NBC in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
One of these executives, Roone Arledge, gave ABC the "Wide World of Sports" 
series three decades ago, "Monday Night Football" two decades ago and 
"Nightline" one decade ago. Arledge, who brought ABC a lasting identification 
with excellence in TV sports coverage -- "Monday Night Football" ranked No. 10 
among all shows in the season just ended -- was ridiculed and criticized when 
he also took over the network's news department and gave its nightly broadcasts 
a fresh look that was heavy on graphics and human interest. 
</P>
<P>
But he was no flake. Besides creating "Nightline," which evolved from coverage 
of the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran in 1979, Arledge built the news 
operation that now represents ABC, and he remains its president. His finest 
achievement will be celebrated Tuesday at 10 p.m. when ABC presents "The Best 
of 'Nightline' with Ted Koppel, 1980-1990." 
</P>
<P>
Another executive whose mark is clearly stamped on ABC is Brandon Stoddard, who 
turned the network's prime-time schedule into a place where viewers could look 
-- and now do -- for quality and experimentation on an ongoing basis. After 
enhancing ABC's image with such special programming as "The Day After," "The 
Winds of War" and "Something About Amelia," he helped bring about, as president 
of the network's entertainment division, series that included "Roseanne," 
"thirtysomething," "The Wonder Years" and "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Under another executive who helped turn ABC into a front-runner, former 
entertainment president Fred Silverman, the network actually bolted into the 
No. 1 position for the first time in the late 1970s. But while its shows 
included such notable hits as "Barney Miller," "Happy Days" and "Family," the 
tone of ABC's lineup was dominated by a barrage of lightheaded series like 
"Laverne &amp; Shirley," "Three's Company," "Charlie's Angels" and "The Love 
Boat." 
</P>
<P>
Silverman, who also helped bring forth "Good Morning America" -- an 
entertainment department series -- was a hero beyond compare at ABC, which for 
years before its prime-time ascension had been regarded with contempt and 
ridicule by its older, more established competitors, CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
But although ABC thus has been No. 1 before, its image at that time was hugely 
different from the one created by the team assembled under Stoddard, who now 
heads the network's in-house unit, ABC Productions. 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest Home Videos," a project of ABC's new entertainment 
president, Robert Iger, is hardly the tone of "thirtysomething" and "The Wonder 
Years," but it is one of those fluky megahits that often propel a network to 
the top of the ratings. Curiously, its breakout success is reminiscent of the 
sudden, fad hits that marked ABC's earlier years -- "Batman," "77 Sunset 
Strip," "The Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
Imitations of "America's Funniest Home Videos" were expected, but some viewers 
must have been startled this week to see the following classified ad in The 
Times: "Shoot Your Family &amp; Friends . . . with your videocamera and KCBS 
will air them during the 11 p.m. Action News broadcast. Send us your funniest, 
most noteworthy video moments." 
</P>
<P>
America's funniest news? 
</P>
<P>
Despite ABC's success with "Home Videos," the network began this season with a 
series far more representative of its new creative mold -- a lovely and gritty 
drama called "Life Goes On," focusing on a teen-age boy with Down's syndrome. 
Iger has renewed it for fall. And then there was "Elvis," about the young Elvis 
Presley -- a stylish series that failed but enhanced ABC's reputation even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
The network has so spoiled its viewers by doing the unusual that it may 
actually face a slip in reputation if it cancels two series still up in the air 
for renewal -- the Vietnam drama "China Beach" and the Jamie Lee Curtis-Richard 
Lewis sitcom "Anything But Love," a couple of shows with rare spunk for prime 
time and distinctive styles as well. 
</P>
<P>
And now comes Winfrey in "Brewster Place" as ABC once again offers an 
intriguing project -- a half-hour series set in a black inner-city community in 
1967. It will be launched May 1 and May 8 in the choice Tuesday time period 
following "Roseanne," then settle into its regular Wednesday slot May 9 at 9:30 
p.m. If Winfrey manages anywhere near the ratings clout she has on her daytime 
talk show, ABC could be off on another roll -- one that could help the network 
finally catch front-runner NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Competitively, it's been a fine season for ABC. It had four series in the Top 
10 -- "Roseanne," "America's Funniest Home Videos," "The Wonder Years" and 
"Monday Night Football." It also won three nights -- Monday, Tuesday and 
Friday. What's more, ABC is taking sharp aim at two opposition fortresses -- 
with "Videos" bringing down CBS' "Murder, She Wrote" and thus putting Sundays 
up for grabs, and the eccentric soap opera "Twin Peaks" at least providing 
contrast to NBC's Thursday lineup, dominated for six seasons by "The Cosby 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
From sunup to "Nightline," a wonder year indeed.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: WADING THROUGH A FLOOD OF EARTH DAY SPECIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
Will too much of a good thing turn out to be a bad thing? 
</P>
<P>
There is not always strength in numbers. The danger exists that the sheer crush 
of this week's programming keyed to Sunday's 20th anniversary of Earth Day will 
be ultimately less illuminating and motivating than desensitizing. It all gets 
to be a blur. 
</P>
<P>
If there's one of these programs that makes unique use of television, however, 
it's the ambitious, two-hour "Time Warner Presents the Earth Day Special" at 9 
p.m. Sunday on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). 
</P>
<P>
Too often it's sophomoric, preachy, heavy-handed, disjointed and as scattershot 
as TV itself. Yet it's also touched by genius on occasion, and its use of 
celebrities in an eclectic, loose-and-easy narrative about our imperiled 
environment turns out to be as educational as it is sometimes entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar faces range from Barbra Streisand, Magic Johnson and E. T. to 
Bette Midler, who spends most of the time on her back in intensive care as an 
apparently mortally ill Mother Earth. Outside, Candice Bergen stands in front 
of a TV camera as Murphy Brown: "There are unconfirmed reports that Mother 
Earth is dying." 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the story, then, becomes Mother Earth's rescue from the lethal 
ignorance of a littering, destroying, plastic-bagging, plastic-foaming, 
aluminum-canning humanity. And the means is education, whether it's Danny 
DeVito getting environmentally lobbied by his wife, Rhea Perlman, in their 
roles as a couple watching all of this on TV, or Kevin Costner as a bartender 
advising a patron played by Meryl Streep, who feels the problem is too 
overwhelming for a single person to make a difference. He tells her: "You need 
to do something instead of being afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Hemion is the director of "The Earth Day Special" and Armyan Bernstein, 
Richard Baskin and Paul Junger Witt the executive producers. Even if this 
program itself were mostly rubbish, it would be worth watching for a brilliant 
short sketch with Robin Williams as a concerned Everyman and Dustin Hoffman as 
an unconcerned Everylawyer debating ecological issues over lunch. Everylawyer: 
"Let me tell you, plants and flowers in the wrong hands is a dangerous thing." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rick Moranis, Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase play Earth Day-ridiculing 
friends whose smoky card game is visited by DeVito in a nightmare. Chase: "Save 
the whales, save the trees, save your breath!" 
</P>
<P>
Exactly. A nice thing about this program is its acknowledgement of the 
skepticism and apathy that encumber the movement to stem the planet's 
destructive spiral, and also its awareness that Sunday's momentum may be 
fleeting and perhaps most do-gooders will suffer amnesia a day later. Mother 
Earth: ". . . Monday comes, and people forget." 
</P>
<P>
But this attitude is countered here by clear and concise tips on what 
individuals can do to help launder the environment. Put it this way, recovery 
sounds manageable, and that's the key. 
</P>
<P>
What you don't see in "The Earth Day Special" is the sheer beauty of the planet 
that's said to be in jeopardy. That comes in "Challenge of the Seas," a truly 
swell, pictorially grand series from Hardy Jones and Julia Whitty that 
premieres at 9 p.m. Sunday on cable's Arts &amp; Entertainment network. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the sea's net-ravaged population are on display here, with Ted 
Danson as on-camera host and occasional narrator. 
</P>
<P>
The opening program on the gliding giant manta is breathtaking, its every 
movement part of a graceful underwater ballet. The mantas look like black-caped 
figures when silhouetted in the deep, and Jones goes for a ride on one of these 
beautiful creatures, each treating the other gently, man and fish not as 
enemies but in concert. 
</P>
<P>
In the second program, Jones and cinematographer Howard Hall swim safely among 
hundreds of seemingly docile hammerhead sharks, huge schools migrating with an 
eerie slowness as if pulled forward by a magnetic force. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins are the subjects of the amazing third and fourth programs, in which 
Jones and Whitty -- who are married -- frolic beneath the sea and even 
communicate with these highly intelligent creatures. You just have to see it. 
</P>
<P>
The enormous appeal of these programs is that they present fish and underwater 
animals not as abstractions but as our planetary partners. Much as Jane Goodall 
used the power of television to enable us to identify with the wild dogs, 
baboons and chimps she closely studied in Africa, Jones and Whitty return to a 
school of dolphins they have been observing for years and, in a manner of 
speaking ("Any chance that could be Dee Dee?"), renew old acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
What a thrill it is to experience this enfolding realm with them, and to watch 
the gap separating man and animal being narrowed.

SHELLSHOCKED BY TURTLEMANIA;

<P>
MOVIES: THE BOX OFFICE SETS RECORDS, BUT PRODUCT TIE-INS ARE 'BIGGER THAN THE 
MOVIE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On Monday morning, April 2, as Hollywood counted the weekend box office 
receipts, marketing minds all over town fixed upon a single tongue-twisting 
title, put in the form of a question: "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"? 
</P>
<P>
What were they? Where did they come from? And how did a movie with a title like 
that make $25 million in its opening weekend, an especially impressive figure 
since it was compiled in large part from children's lower ticket prices? 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 one movie in America for the last three weeks, "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles" has already made more money ($72.9 million in grosses and counting) 
than any independent film in history and threatens to wise-crack its way into 
the company of such youth market icons as "Star Wars," "Batman" and "E.T." 
</P>
<P>
Based on comic book characters that had already inspired a weekly animated 
cartoon show, this improbable blockbuster from the distributors of "Nightmare 
on Elm St." (New Line Cinema) and the makers of "The Cannonball Run" (Golden 
Harvest Films), is a "live-action" children's adventure story about four 
oversized turtles touched accidentally with human intelligence who live in the 
sewers of New York, use martial-arts skills to combat the forces of evil, love 
pizza and talk like Sean Penn's famously stoned surfer in "Fast Times at 
Ridgemont High." 
</P>
<P>
Played by actors in neoprene, computer-controlled creature suits, the 
anthropomorphic terrapins call each other "dude," shout "bodacious!" and make 
bad jokes about current TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
The title itself sounded like a joke to some of the people who made the film. 
Thomas K. Gray, the 44-year-old chief executive at Golden Harvest Films, which 
has a total of six employees and releases an average of two to three pictures a 
year, concedes he was skeptical when a young comedy writer named Bobby Herbeck 
first approached him with the idea in 1988. "I admittedly had never heard of 
it," Gray says of the comic book and cartoon show. "I said, 'I'm not going to 
do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Herbeck, who was writing a different film for Gray at the time, persisted 
and finally persuaded Gray to meet Kim Dawson, a producer trying to make a deal 
for the live-action rights to the Turtle characters. When Gray had lunch with 
Dawson, Gray recalls, "We talked about everything under the sun, except the 
Turtles. And at the end of the meeting, Kim started to pitch the Turtles. I 
said, 'Forget it, I'm not interested in this."' 
</P>
<P>
As Gray was getting up from the booth to return to the office, Dawson thrust 
the comic book at him, and the executive opened it up and glanced at a page. "I 
looked at the comic book," Gray says, "and something snapped. I thought, 'Wait 
a minute, we can do this. All you have to do is put stunt men in turtle suits, 
and you could knock this off for a very low budget, and if it doesn't make 
money here it could make money around the world.' So that's how it got going." 
</P>
<P>
There had been earlier proposals for a movie based on the Turtles, says Mark 
Freedman, the licensing agent for Turtle creators Peter Laird and Kevin 
Eastman. Gary Propper, the manager of the comedian Gallagher, for example, 
envisioned a movie that would star Gallagher, John Candy and two other 
comedians as versions of the Turtles. Freedman said no to that idea. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in large part to Freedman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were already 
a budding industry in 1988, when Playmate Toys unleashed a line of Ninja Turtle 
figures that reinforced the syndicated cartoon show (financed largely by 
Playmate) that hit the air in late 1987 and was picked up by Group W 
Broadcasting. By 1989, Turtle tie-ins with cereal brands, fast food chains, K 
mart, video games and other merchandisers amounted to more than $250 million in 
sales worldwide, a figure expected to double this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're much bigger than the movie," says Freedman, 35, the Long Island-based 
marketing consultant who assumes full responsi bility for Turtlemania and 
claims to be "the person who created the phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman, who once hyped paraphernalia for Saturday morning cartoon characters 
Alvin and the Chipmunks, was out of work and looking for a job in 1986 when he 
first heard about the Turtle comic book from a friend. "I thought it was a 
joke," he says. He learned it was a joke but also real. Laird, now 36, and 
Eastman, now 27, both residents of Northampton, Mass., had been self-publishing 
a periodic black-and-white comic book since 1983 which attempted to poke fun at 
the comic strip tradition of superheroes. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't get a job in the comic book industry," Freedman says. 
</P>
<P>
He got them a deal with Archie Comics, which now brings out 500,000 copies of 
the Turtles book every six weeks. He also set up the arrangement with Playmate 
that led to the TV show and the ensuing 100-odd product tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
But a movie? "Our biggest fear was that a movie would look like 'Howard the 
Duck,' Freedman recalls, referring to the disastrous 1986 adapation by George 
Lucas and Universal Pictures of another off-center comic book. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to reassure them that we weren't going to screw up this successful 
thing they had created," says Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Gray quieted Freedman's fears enough to secure an option for Golden Harvest, 
which turned for financing to an affiliated company, Golden Communications, the 
Kung Fu cinema factory based in Hong Kong best known for its Bruce Lee and 
Jackie Chan pictures. 
</P>
<P>
But there was still the all-important matter of finding a U.S. distributor. All 
of the major studios passed on the opportunity to release "Turtles," including 
Warner Bros., which had distributed other Golden Harvest films. Most of the 
leading independent companies passed as well. 
</P>
<P>
Gray says the distributors didn't think a decent film could be made for the 
kind of money they were talking about. "Turtles" was originally budgeted at 
$8.2 million, and came in at $10.4 million, about half the cost of an average 
major studio movie. He says distribution company executives, still cautious in 
that period between "Howard the Duck" and "Batman," didn't take the time to 
look at the demographics of Ninja Turtle toys and comic books. And, there was 
that title. 
</P>
<P>
"If you make something that sounds like 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and it 
doesn't work, then I don't think your future's going to be too bright," says 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at New Line Cinema thought otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"What I saw looked really fun to me," says the New York-based company's 
president Robert Shaye, who examined Bobby Herbeck's script and a sample reel 
of the "animatronic" Turtles (actors working inside electronically controlled 
Turtle suits) created by Jim Henson's London Creature Shop. 
</P>
<P>
Shaye says there was concern at New Line that the film would only appeal to 
little kids, but they went for it anyway, buying the North American theatrical 
and home video rights for a figure he puts at "several million" dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever New Line paid, it was a bargain. Industry analysts estimate that if 
"Turtles" grosses $100 million in the U.S. and Canada, which now seems certain, 
New Line and Golden Harvest will each earn at least $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Laird and Eastman aren't giving out figures on what they're pulling down from 
the burgeoning Turtle industry, but their partnership with Freedman takes a 
royalty of 3% to 12% on everything with the Turtle name on it. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's box-office figures are being hailed in Hollywood as a significant 
breakthrough for independents, who are generally at a huge disadvantage when 
competing with the Big Seven studios for exhibition space on the nation's movie 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
"If an exhibitor harbored any doubts that an independent can deliver the kind 
of grosses that you associate with a Warners or a Paramount release, this 
should change their minds," says Mitchell Goldman, president of distribution 
for New Line. 
</P>
<P>
New Line, a company that has customarily aimed its release of movies like 
"Hairspray," "The Hidden" and the gruesome "Nightmare on Elm St." series at 
specific audiences, changed its strategy for the Turtles movie. "It was harder 
(to promote) than 'Nightmare on Elm St.,' says Goldman, "because we wanted to 
go for everybody and that's expensive." 
</P>
<P>
The company had help from movie theater owners who saw the film at an industry 
convention in February and were sufficiently impressed to agree to extra local 
promotions. "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" opened on 1,956 screens across 
America on March 30, a day chosen because it coincided with a large number of 
school holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman says he began to be optimistic after learning the results of two test 
screenings in early March -- not at Saturday matinees but at two colleges, MIT 
and Arizona State University at Tempe. "We knew that the Turtles were hip 
because the comic book had started in colleges. But when they turned people 
away at both those screenings, we knew we were looking at a possible 
breakthrough movie that was going to cross boundaries and get teen-agers and 
college kids, as well as smaller kids and their parents." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, no one was quite prepared for that $25-million opening or what 
followed. "We had an inkling that we had a shot at being something very 
substantial, but not this substantial," says Shaye. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stunned, along with the rest of the industry," says Gray. "This has 
changed a lot of minds about what children's movies can do."

RELIGIOUS FAITHS DECRY HIGH COURT RULING; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTITUTION: CRITICS SAY A BASIC FREEDOM IS IMPERILED BY THE OPINION IN THE 
PEYOTE CASE THAT RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS ARE A 'LUXURY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asserting that spiritual freedoms in America are at great risk, religious 
organizations this week decried a U.S. Supreme Court decision that removed 
constitutional protection not only for American Indians who use the drug peyote 
as a sacrament but also for other religions whose practices may conflict with 
state laws. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a shocker; the nation's first liberty has become a constitutional 
stepchild." said Oliver Thomas, legal counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee 
on Public Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible decision for religious liberty," said Amy Adelson, staff 
attorney for the American Jewish Congress. "The court's majority members 
completely revamped the 'free exercise' (of religion) clause of the First 
Amendment as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
The lament over the court's ruling extended from experts on church-state 
matters to believers who are most directly affected, such as 91-year-old Native 
American Church leader Truman Dailey of Red Rock, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
"This medicine has been our faith . . . we use it with a spiritual attitude in 
prayer and singing," said Dailey in a telephone interview. The cactus peyote 
"button" is chewed and its hallucinogenic drug ingested in rites central to the 
Native American Church, which combines native traditions and Christian beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, by a 6-3 margin, on Tuesday upheld the dismissal of two members 
of the Native American Church who were fired from their jobs as drug counselors 
in Oregon after they admitted ingesting peyote during a religious ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court's majority, declared 
that "we cannot afford the luxury" of striking down laws just because they 
limit someone's religious practices. 
</P>
<P>
Although Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented by saying the majority opinion 
changed religious liberty from "an essential element" to a "luxury," Scalia 
asserted that the justices "have never held that an individual's religious 
beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting the 
conduct that the state is free to regulate." 
</P>
<P>
Scalia advised religious groups to seek protection through laws that allow 
exceptions to cover their beliefs and practices. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 23 states have laws allowing the controlled use of peyote by the Native 
American Church, according to Americans United for the Separation of Church and 
State, an interdenominational group based in Silver Spring, Md. But religious 
libertarians say that legislatures cannot always anticipate how laws will 
affect religious groups. In addition, they say, changing public moods can swing 
against the idea of religious exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The court system, and especially the U.S. Supreme Court, frequently has 
defended small and often unpopular groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses, the 
Amish and Seventh-day Adventists when laws appeared to violate their First 
Amendment guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia, in his opinion, conceded that the new ruling "will place at a relative 
disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in, but that 
unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system 
in which each conscience is a law." 
</P>
<P>
The opinion spells trouble to Mike Burgess, a Comanche who once edited the 
now-defunct Talking Leaf newspaper for the Los Angeles Indian community. "There 
aren't enough Indians in any one state to have enough strong political clout," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
An inactive member of the Native American Church, Burgess said that peyote acts 
as "a communicator between the participant and the Creator, but using it this 
way does not make it addictive." 
</P>
<P>
More than one critic of the court decision said the peyote case "could not have 
come at a worse time" for American Indians. Observers believe the justices did 
not want to open the door to small religious bodies claiming that marijuana is 
important to their beliefs, such as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. 
</P>
<P>
But courts have made reasonable distinctions before between authentic religious 
tradition and less-established practices, and could do so again, according to 
attorney Steven C. Moore of the Native American Rights Fund. The Boulder, 
Colo.-based organization filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the Oregon case 
on behalf of the defendants. Moore said the bitter-tasting peyote button is not 
sold on the street and only has a ceremonial use. 
</P>
<P>
Indian leaders, in both mainstream Christian and non-Christian circles, said 
they were disappointed that Tuesday's ruling showed anew the lack of impact of 
the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1979, a non-binding declaration of 
Congress which asked that the federal government show sensitivity to the 
religious practices of Indians, Eskimos and native Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely an eroding away of American Indian rights," said Little 
Crow, also known as the Rev. Carl Bryant of the American Indian Unity Church of 
Garden Grove. He said Indians should nevertheless continue in their ways: "If 
we give up our world view, then (the government) will do it with the Sikhs, the 
Buddhists and the Baptists." 
</P>
<P>
Similar fears were expressed by organizations concerned with religious 
liberties. 
</P>
<P>
"This case tells us a lot about how the court will react in future cases on the 
free exercise of religion," said Rob Boston, a spokesman for Americans United 
for Separation of Church and State. He said that the decision is a harbinger of 
a narrowing interpretation of the First Amendment by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The American Jewish Congress' Adelson, interviewed by phone from the 
organization's New York headquarters, said, "Until this decision, it was 
generally believed without question that while individuals may lose a claim of 
religious exemption, the state would have to make an attempt to justify the 
burden on the religious practice." 
</P>
<P>
The state no longer has that burden, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only hope that those states will keep those exemptions . . . but they 
don't have to," Adelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Thomas, the counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee in Washington, said 
he believes there is "a strong probability" that the Supreme Court decision 
could affect mainline churches in the areas of taxation, church property, 
church schools and day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ron Garat, professor of law and religion at USC, said that large 
religious bodies probably have the ability to use the political process to 
protect their interests. 
</P>
<P>
But Garat said smaller religious groups are likely to encounter difficulties 
with the direction being taken by the present Supreme Court under Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a direction making it harder and harder to obtain exemptions," he said. 
"If the purpose of a statute is legitimate and not designed to suppress a 
religious group," Garat said it would not be unconstitutional under the new 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the best of motives by legislatures, however, Garat said "it is 
hopeless to foresee all the burdens they might impose on religious groups."

CHRISTIAN GROUPS JOIN EFFORT TO UPSET JUDGMENT AGAINST KRISHNAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several Christian organizations have joined in a brief to the U.S. Supreme 
Court on behalf of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, which is 
appealing a court ruling that the Hindu sect caused emotional distress to the 
parents of a former member. The Krishnas are also facing a judicial order, 
temporarily stayed this week, to sell five of their temples to satisfy a 
$5-million judgment in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"The survival of a whole religious movement may be at stake," said the brief 
filed Tuesday by the National Council of Churches, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge James A. Jackman has ordered the sale of the 
Krishna properties, including the sect's western world headquarters complex in 
Los Angeles, to fulfill the judgment in a suit brought in 1977 by a Cypress 
woman who claimed that her 15-year-old daughter was kept hidden by the sect. 
The suit by Marcia George and her daughter, Robin, accused the Krishnas of 
false imprisonment and emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
"Multimillion-dollar suits for punitive damages and emotional distress have 
become the principal instrument of religious persecution in America," said 
James A. Hamilton, general secretary of the National Council of Churches. 
"Lawyers inflame juries to hatred of unfamiliar religions and then ask them to 
award millions of dollars for emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the National Council, groups joining in the brief include the 
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, Church of the Brethren, General 
Conference of the Mennonite Church, Unitarian Universalist Assn. and several 
Hindu and human rights organizations. The National Assn. of Evangelicals has 
also filed a brief in support of the Krishnas. 
</P>
<P>
Krishna leaders have staged a series of vigils and protests around the world 
this year, claiming a breach of religious freedom, including a three-hour 
prayer vigil Tuesday near the Federal Building in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court announced on Monday that it granted the sect's request for a 
delay on the property sales until the justices decide whether to hear the 
appealed case. 
</P>
<P>
Sect officials say that their temples in Los Angeles, New York, New Orleans, 
San Diego and Laguna Beach are in receivership, although some other combination 
of assets could be sold to satisfy the court judgment.

EID-UL-FITR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eid-ul-Fitr, the Islamic festival that ends the fasting month of Ramadan, will 
begin either Thursday or Friday, depending traditionally on the sighting of the 
new moon's slim crescent the night before. Using calculations of the lunar 
month, the Islamic Center of Southern California has announced that it will 
mark the start of Eid-ul-Fitr on Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: Very early in the history of Islam, Muslims began observing daytime 
fasting during the month of Ramadan. Eid-ul-Fitr, or the "festival of breaking 
the fast," celebrates the conclusion of the introspective period. 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVANCES: Mosques and Islamic centers will hold prayers early on the first 
morning of the festival. The family oriented celebration lasts for several 
days. In Los Angeles, a now-annual Eid Carnival will be held Sunday, April 29, 
at Marshall High School in the Los Feliz area.

SEMINARY ENROLLMENT INCREASES 5.1%

<TEXT>
<P>
Enrollment in the 203 seminaries belonging to the Assn. of Theological Schools 
in the United States and Canada increased 5.1% at the beginning of the 1989-90 
school year, including gains by blacks, Latinos, Pacific/Asians and women. 
</P>
<P>
However, while total enrollment was up, the percentage of full-time students 
continued to drop, reflecting a trend characteristic of seminary attendance 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"The sharp increase this year may well reflect the success of school efforts to 
serve a broader constituency with a variety of graduate-level programs," Father 
William Baumgaertner, associate director of the association, said in releasing 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the opening fall 1989 enrollment in schools belonging 
to the Vandalia, Ohio-based association totaled 56,082 compared to 55,405 a 
year earlier.

LABELS PROVE A CRATE SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLECTIBLES: GROWERS USED TO USE LABELS TO IDENTIFY THEIR PRODUCE. TODAY, 
THOSE LABELS ARE DECORATOR ITEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gorgeous, lush and immaculate Southern California of memory was formed in 
large part by a most unusual phenomenon: orange crate labels. 
</P>
<P>
Around 1890, as growers began in earnest to ship their orange crops east, they 
struggled to differentiate their produce from that of other farmers in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Although consumers almost never saw the labels, which were used on the side of 
wooden shipping crates, distributors did. Labels were made as spectacular as 
possible so the distributor would remember the orchard's name and place repeat 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
Orange crate labels were lithographed with acid-etched granite plates, a 
technique that produced long-lasting, exquisitely colored pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Taaffe, second vice president of the Citrus Label Society, said there 
are three distinct historic periods of labels. 
</P>
<P>
"The first is the natural stage," Taaffe said. "These showed groves, mountains 
and western scenes." This period ran from about 1885 to 1920. 
</P>
<P>
From 1920-35, label artists used an advertising approach, Taaffe said, and the 
primary focus was the healthy aspects of the orange and its juice. 
</P>
<P>
"Then from 1930 to 1955, you saw the commercial-art type of labels: big slanted 
letters and bright colors," Taaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
But when cardboard boxes came into wide use in the mid '50s, "that was about 
the end of the labels," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors can find common labels priced from $1 to $5, better specimens at up 
to $50 and rarities as high as $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the rarest has only about six copies in existence now," Taaffe said. 
The label is a picture of Uncle Sam holding a cluster of oranges and saying, "I 
Grow These Myself." It was printed in 1898 and used by a Riverside grower with 
no real connection to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
If you're interested in collecting, trading or just looking at citrus labels, 
the Citrus Label Society is holding a meeting today from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 
the Sunkist Headquarters, 14130 Riverside Dr., Sherman Oaks. Admission is free. 
Labels will be displayed, and you can buy and sell. 
</P>
<P>
The society meets monthly; call (714) 792-9021 for a schedule.

ORANGE SHOW OFFERS AN A-PEELING SLICE OF CALIFORNIA LORE;

Ask most Californians what happened in the 1840s, and they'll tell you that's 
when gold was discovered. But another kind of gold also came to the state 
during that busy decade: Growers produced the first commercial orange crop. 
</P>
<P>
Oranges are the main attraction at the 75th Diamond Jubilee of the National 
Orange Show, which continues through April 29 at the National Orange Show 
Fairgrounds in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the 75th year of the show (there was a hiatus during World War II), 
and we plan to always honor oranges," said C. Roger Cooper, president of the 
nonprofit show's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest groves of oranges were planted near Union Station in downtown Los 
Angeles, which made shipping easier. By the 1850s, oranges grown in Southern 
California were being sent by wagon to Los Angeles Harbor, by boat from there 
to San Francisco and then by wagon again to gold mining towns near Sacramento. 
Lemons, highly prized because they stayed fresh longer, sold for as much as $1 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
In 1877, a load of Valencia oranges grown in the Southland was shipped east for 
the first time, arriving in St. Louis two months after it left. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the introduction of navel oranges in the early 1880s that cemented 
the fruit's position as a key agricultural crop. Two parent trees of Washington 
Navels -- called that because they cleared customs in the nation's capital 
after being shipped from Brazil -- were sent to Luther and Eliza Tibbets, 
growers in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
One of the trees died shortly after its arrival; the other is still thriving. 
(If you'd like to see this historic orange tree, stop at the intersection of 
Magnolia and Arlington avenues the next time you're in Riverside. It was 
transplanted to this site in 1902.) 
</P>
<P>
Navels had the distinct advantage of producing a crop virtually the entire 
year, and they were neater to eat than juicy Valencias because the thick skin 
was easier to peel. (Navels are so named because of the depression at the 
orange's end, which contains a small, undeveloped secondary fruit.) 
</P>
<P>
By 1911, oranges were such a popular crop that promoters in San Bernardino 
County were advertising 50 acres, already planted with trees, for $5,000. Many 
of the people who optimistically bought these little orchards were out of 
business within a year, but many hung on. Agricultural production in Southern 
California peaked in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Then a more alluring gold -- skyrocketing real estate prices -- slowly began to 
turn the thousands of acres of orange groves into housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in the number of groves was hastened as neighboring residents 
started complaining about "smudge-pot smog" -- the gritty black smoke from 
diesel-powered pots used to prevent fruit from freezing. And although the 
oranges were there first, many localities decided to ban oil heaters in the 
orchards. 
</P>
<P>
A great many of Southern California's best-known institutions are built on what 
used to be orange groves, including Disneyland and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Although the crop has dwindled in this part of the state, interest in it and 
its lore has not. The National Orange Show, which opened Thursday, was started 
in 1911, and Cooper said the organization plans to open a packing house museum 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
The orange show is open from 3 to 10 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 10 
p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. It features exhibits on the history of oranges, 
in addition to handmade quilts, baked goods, flower arrangements and livestock 
displays. Entertainers ranging from Glen Campbell and Donny Osmond to Frankie 
Avalon and Annette Funicello will be featured. 
</P>
<P>
The National Orange Show, through April 29, 3 to 10 p.m. weekdays, 10 a.m. to 
10 p.m. weekends, 689 E St., San Bernardino (near the intersection of 
Interstates 215 and 10). For information, call (714) 383-5444. Admission to the 
show is $5 for adults, $3 for children 6 to 12, and free for children 5 and 
under.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE IN NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was not until the 16th Century in England and later in this country that we 
began to acquire middle names. 
</P>
<P>
These began as an additional Christian name given at confirmation ceremonies in 
the Old Country. German immigrants were the first to consistently use middle 
names in this country. In America, a boy was often given his mother's maiden 
name as a middle name. 
</P>
<P>
Middle names at first honored a maternal line; they gave an alternative to a 
common or disliked "first name" or perked up a plain name, according to Leonard 
R. N. Ashley in his new book, "What's in a Name?" (Genealogical Publishing Co., 
1001 N. Calvert St., Baltimore, Md. 21202, $21.45 postage paid). He cites 
examples of William French Smith and William Tecumseh Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley, one of the foremost scholars on names, believes that girls should be 
given middle names that connect them to maternal as well as paternal relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly American," he says, "to reduce middle names to initials. 
The U.S. armed forces expect you to have three names: a first name, a middle 
name and a last name. If you have no middle name you'll go down in the records 
as NMI (no middle initial)." 
</P>
<P>
When choosing a middle name for your child, Ashley suggests you first see how 
the mother's maiden name sounds with the father's, and keep in mind the 
initials that will result. You might think twice about naming a child 
Christopher Isherwood Anderson, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Using a middle name is one way to avoid the dreaded Jr., which some 
psychiatrists say gives the child a sense of being a carbon copy, not an 
original, and a name to live up to (or live down) that is not truly his. Some 
studies have shown that a child named after one of his parents stands a greater 
chance of being abused. In a Veterans Administration mental hospital, Junior 
turned up three times more often than in the general population. However, that 
1971 study is disputed, Ashley says. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally we should abandon the 'Sr.' and 'Jr.' business just as the British 
have given up the Elder and the Younger," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley has some other thoughts to consider about personal names: 
</P>
<P>
* Names exert great power. 
</P>
<P>
* Few men have grown into greatness whose names are subject to ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
* Be as considerate with the names of others, including your own children, as 
you want people to be with yours. 
</P>
<P>
* Our names make us as much as we make our names.

ARMY GROUNDS CH-47 COPTERS AFTER CRACKED PARTS ARE FOUND

The Army announced Friday that it had grounded its fleet of Boeing CH-47D 
transport helicopters for safety inspections, one day after congressional 
investigators attacked alleged design problems in another type of Army 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second grounding of the CH-47s in eight months, this time for 
inspection of nuts used to lock the engine transmission to the frame. 
</P>
<P>
The Army said some cracked nuts were found during recent routine maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has experienced problems with a wide range of helicopters in the past 
two years and the Pentagon is now deciding whether to go ahead with a new 
multibillion-dollar program of light utility and scout helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office reported at a House hearing Thursday that the 
AH-64 Apache attack helicopters made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. had serious 
problems with rotor blades and malfunctioning electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO recommended that the Apache force be limited to 675 aircraft purchased 
or under contract instead of the proposed $12 billion fleet of 807, and that 
plans to upgrade the helicopter be deferred until the Army has dealt with 
problems in maintaining them. 
</P>
<P>
The CH-47D is produced by the Boeing-Vertol division of Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Army said it had ordered the grounding of all 290 helicopters in the fleet 
"because cracks have been found in the barrel nuts associated with the 
aircraft's forward transmission." Four of the nuts are used to secure the 
transmission to the body of the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The cracked nuts were discovered recently while being replaced on a CH-47D 
undergoing a normal maintenance operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Army said approximately 300 of the suspect barrel nuts were in the 
service's inventory and that the helicopters would be allowed to fly until the 
four nuts on each had been inspected.

ISRAELI COURT BARS EVICTION OF 150 SETTLERS

<P>
Israel's Supreme Court on Friday blocked the eviction of Jewish settlers from 
the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, temporarily setting aside an 
order by the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The 150 settlers can remain in the former Hospice of St. John, near the Church 
of the Holy Sepulcher, until the high court hears more arguments next week on 
an appeal by the settlers to remain. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Yosef Harish on Thursday had ordered the immediate eviction of the 
settlers from the 72-room complex, owned by the Greek Orthodox Church. Harish 
said he wanted to prevent further deterioration of Jewish-Christian relations. 
</P>
<P>
The church claims that a former tenant illegally sold his user rights to the 
building to the settlers. 
</P>
<P>
The move by the settlers into the Christian Quarter last week sparked protests 
by Arab Christians and Muslims. They fear that the group is leading a campaign 
to eventually push all Palestinians out of the walled Old City. 
</P>
<P>
After the high court allowed the settlers to stay, half a dozen Greek Orthodox 
priests carrying candles staged a protest vigil outside the complex. Black 
flags fluttered from the Holy Sepulcher and the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's hearing, the Supreme Court made no reference to the religious and 
political dimensions of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing Parliament member Hanan Porath said even though the court treated 
the case as a simple tenancy dispute, it is a political confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"The motives of all sides are political. This is a struggle over the rights of 
Jews to live everywhere in Jerusalem," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Anger over the move has been heightened by the fact that under Israeli law, 
Arabs cannot buy land in the Old City's Jewish Quarter. The city also contains 
Armenian and Muslim quarters.

SANDS OF TIME ARE PAYING OFF ON ONCE-BARE OCEANSIDE BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers has concluded that an experimental $12.3-million 
project is successfully restoring sand to Oceanside's eroded beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some discouragement when the innovative pumping system fired up last 
June, the corps now says it can distribute 120,000 cubic yards of sand a year 
and probably much more. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Whitson, the city's project manager, said experts realized by December 
that the system had reached a milestone: "They were seeing sand build up at the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, the system has shown that it can prevent sand from blocking 
the entrance to Oceanside Harbor, a problem that has required expensive 
dredging. 
</P>
<P>
The results have the city and the corps optimistic that Oceanside's chronic 
beach erosion and harbor blockage problems can be solved if a $2.7-million 
second phase of the project is approved by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Beaches have eroded, sometimes down to bare rock, since Camp Pendleton's boat 
harbor and jetty were built in 1942, disrupting the natural southerly flow of 
sand onto Oceanside beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Congress authorized the project in 1982, but pumping didn't begin until last 
June. Although the system quickly looked promising, it suffered equipment 
failures and annoying delays. 
</P>
<P>
But the corps, waiting until the system had operated during some of the winter 
before deciding whether the state-of-the-art technology actually worked, has 
judged it a success. 
</P>
<P>
The corps' report says that "the gradual increase in beach width at the 
disposal site . . . gives an indication of how the bypass can nourish the beach 
by continually supplying sand and simulates a more natural method of beach 
replenishment." 
</P>
<P>
The system vacuums sand trapped at the entrance to Oceanside Harbor and the Del 
Mar Boat Basin at Camp Pendleton and pumps it south to the beach through a 
buried pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
According to the corps, the system has moved up to 250 cubic yards of sand an 
hour, but the average production is about 80 cubic yards an hour, or 120,000 
cubic yards annually. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson and the corps have told Congress that the system is not operating at 
peak capacity, however, because the jet pumps leave a big hole where they suck 
up sand. Not as much sand can be sent to the beaches because "time is required 
for the waves and long-shore currents to refill the crater with sand in order 
to resume pumping," the corps said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson said an additional $2.7-million federal appropriation would pay for the 
installation of perforated pipes called "fluidizers" that would mix water and 
sand to quickly replenish the crater. 
</P>
<P>
The sand-pumping project is vital to replenish city beaches that, because of 
their narrowness, have made coastal property vulnerable to storm damage, 
Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
"A wide beach is the best possible protection from storm waves," she said.

OFFICER SAYS SUSPECT ADMITTED HOSPITAL SHOOTINGS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: BRADFORD WARREN POWERS JR. WANTED TO PREVENT "QUACKS" FROM HARMING OTHER 
PATIENTS, ACCORDING TO THE OCEANSIDE POLICE OFFICER WHO WATCHED OVER HIM AFTER 
THE SLAYINGS.

<P>
After surrendering to police last weekend, Bradford Warren Powers Jr. 
complained that the doctors at Mission Bay Memorial Hospital were "quacks" and 
that he had shot several people there so they would not harm other patients, a 
police officer told The Times on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Powers was "just as calm as could be," said Officer Randy Judd of the Oceanside 
Police Department, who watched over the 46-year-old La Jolla man for two hours 
until San Diego authorities picked him up after he allegedly shot four people 
in the hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he didn't want an attorney, that he wanted to go in front of a judge 
and get it over with. He said he wanted the gas chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Grief-stricken over his father's death in the emergency room eight hours 
earlier, police say, Powers walked into the hospital emergency room about 4:45 
p.m. last Saturday and fired about eight rounds. A nurse and student medical 
trainee were killed; a doctor and a patient's father were wounded in the spray 
of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the shootings, Powers telephoned police from a phone booth 
in Oceanside, saying he wanted to turn himself in. Once in police custody, 
Powers sat with Judd for about two hours, the officer said, until San Diego 
police arrived to hold him on suspicion of murder and assault. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting calmly in an Oceanside holding cell, Powers continued to talk to Judd 
about the shootings, the officer said, "going over it like he wanted me to know 
what was going on. . . . He just said that he thought he had shot three or four 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"He said: 'I shot them. I'm the guy you want,' " Judd said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Powers went to the hospital to avenge the death of his 
father, Brad Powers Sr., a well-known architectural illustrator. The elder 
Powers, 75, was overweight and suffered from heart and lung problems, doctors 
said. He had gone to the Mission Bay Memorial emergency room late Friday, 
complaining of shortness of breath, and was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
But, early the next morning, Powers Sr. returned to the emergency room, this 
time complaining of abdominal pain, said Dr. Harry Henderson, the hospital's 
chief of staff-elect. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, doctors discovered an abdominal aneurysm, a condition they said 
was not present the previous day. Saying that surgery was the elder Powers' 
only hope for life, they decided to operate. But he suffered a heart attack on 
the operating table and died about 8:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and hospital officials have said they did all they could to save the 
elder Powers. 
</P>
<P>
"Mission Bay hospital stands behind earlier statements that all care given to 
Mr. Powers was appropriate," hospital spokesman Jeff Simmons said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But some family members disagree. In an interview, architect Charles Powers, 
the brother of Brad Powers Jr., said the family is considering suing the 
hospital for medical malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
Powers Jr. was also upset about the care his father had received, Judd said. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept calling them quacks," the officer said. "He felt the doctor who did 
the surgery was responsible for his dad's death. 
</P>
<P>
"He said somebody had to take care of business. He said these guys go out and 
do things, someone sues, so they move to another hospital, and nothing ever 
gets done about it." 
</P>
<P>
While in the custody of Oceanside police, Powers was calm, though he was 
"emotionally upset about his dad," Judd said. "He said, 'I know I'm going to do 
a lot of time. Personally, I prefer the gas chamber just to get it over with.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Powers repeated himself several times and once asked for a glass of water, Judd 
said. But his primary concern seemed to be calling his mother, Mary. Powers 
lived with his parents in their La Jolla home. 
</P>
<P>
"His major concern was, when detectives came up, he wanted to call his mom and 
tell her he'd done the shooting and turned himself in," Judd said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't irate, he didn't act abnormal. He was real calm. He knew what was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
During his arraignment Tuesday, Powers pleaded not guilty to two counts of 
murder and three counts of attempted murder. Bail was set at $2.5 million. 
Powers is being held in County Jail.

FIRST MEASLES DEATH IN COUNTY IS CONFIRMED; 
</P>
<P>
EPIDEMIC: SECOND VACCINATIONS ARE BEING URGED FOR CHILDREN AS THE COUNTY 
RECORDS 625 CONFIRMED OR PROBABLE CASES OF THE DISEASE THIS YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
An autopsy has confirmed that measles killed a 10-year-old San Diego boy in 
February, making him the first county resident to die in an epidemic that has 
intensified over the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
Blood test results this week confirmed that Hector Lopez had measles, and not 
some other disease that might have contributed to his Feb. 22 death, Deputy 
Coroner Robert Engel said Friday. The cause of death is listed as measles, with 
complications from inflammation of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of this week, 625 confirmed or probable cases of measles had been 
recorded in San Diego County this year, said county public health officer Dr. 
Donald Ramras. 
</P>
<P>
That is nearly 40% higher than occurred in 1982, the last year in which there 
was a significant outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
County and state public health officials say they know what they would do to 
stop San Diego County's epidemic if they had the money: 
</P>
<P>
* Give a second dose of measles vaccine to every schoolchild who hasn't had two 
doses and perhaps also to every child entering junior high or college this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
* Conduct aggressive immunization campaigns in low-income communities. 
</P>
<P>
* Hold mass-immunization clinics in schools and other community locations. 
</P>
<P>
* Open public health clinics at night and on weekends for immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no question a second dose should be done. None," said 
Ramras. "Our advice that we give is based on what we think is best for San 
Diego. But what we, the health department, can offer to the people who come to 
us is predicated on what we get through the state." 
</P>
<P>
But even $5.8 million more for the entire state, approved Wednesday by the 
governor, will not allow such steps to be taken, said John Dunajski, assistant 
chief of the California immunization program. 
</P>
<P>
The extra money will barely cover what had been an expected shortfall of funds 
for first-dose measles vaccine, Dunajski said. 
</P>
<P>
The state, under a federal program, provides low-cost measles vaccine to 
counties. But the number of doses subsidized through this federal effort has 
stayed the same, even as demand has increased. The federal government, though 
recommending the second dose, only provides the low-cost vaccine for first 
doses. 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, where 1,931 cases of measles have occurred so far this year, the 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control is sponsoring a massive immunization project 
today at 19 sites. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, county health clinics, strapped by years of funding shortages, 
give immunizations only a few hours a week, and no special immunization hours 
are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, public health nurses have concentrated on quick investigations of 
every suspected measles case, said Sandy Ross, immunization project coordinator 
for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators give isolation instructions to family and friends if they 
begin showing symptoms. Exposed people also may be given vaccine or immune 
globulin shots to prevent or minimize cases that do arise. 
</P>
<P>
In some schools and day-care centers, children who are considered susceptible 
to measles have been excluded from school for two weeks, at the health 
department's request, when a measles case crops up in a classroom, Ross added. 
</P>
<P>
Public health officials say they are painfully aware that these steps don't 
address the real reasons for measles' spread -- unimmunized preschoolers and 
older children whose first dose of measles vaccine did not work. 
</P>
<P>
Ross noted that the Lopez boy who died was one of the children whose earlier 
vaccine had failed. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Public Health Service issued guidelines in December recommending a 
second measles vaccine for children just before they enter school, for all 
students entering college and for all medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was issued in hopes of preventing the 35% to 40% of measles 
cases affecting persons older than 5 years in whom a first dose did not result 
in immunity, the health service said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are no plans in San Diego County to inoculate all entering 
kindergartners a second time against measles because there is no money to do 
it, Ramras said. He said it would cost $700,000 for vaccine to do that 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, it would cost at least $5 million just for the vaccine to inoculate 
kindergartners and college freshmen, Dunajski said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramras concedes that it isn't much comfort turning the issue of whether to get 
a second measles vaccination over to parents, since the inoculations are 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Just buying the vaccine itself to give shots to his three teen-age and young 
adult children cost $75, Ramras said. At a private doctor's office, a shot 
costs $30 to $40, and many insurance policies don't cover the cost. 
</P>
<P>
If the usual annual cycle holds, the number of new measles cases will taper off 
as the year progresses and then pick up again next winter. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, because the most serious measles cases often occur in babies, 
health officials are recommending that infants be immunized at 12 months, three 
months earlier than usual. But early immunization increases the chance that the 
child won't have permanent immunity, so a second shot between ages 4 and 6 
would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the San Diego outbreak, parents might want to ask their doctors 
about inoculating babies as young as 6 months, Ramras said. Such children would 
need a second shot at 15 months and again at school age. 
</P>
<P>
Older children who never received a second MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) 
shot also should receive a second dose -- even if they are past their teen-age 
years. Anyone born after 1957 is considered at risk, because of problems with 
the early vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Measles begins with cold symptoms and progresses to a high fever and a severe 
rash. Complications can include dehydration, pneumonia, ear infection and 
encephalitis. Encephalitis can leave permanent brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
The measles virus is spread through the air, even as long as an hour after the 
infected person has left a room. It also can be spread before the infected 
person is aware of having the disease. This makes it particularly important for 
parents to leave uninfected children at home when going to doctors' offices or 
an emergency room, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California has had a measles outbreak since 1987, but San Diego's did 
not take hold until last year. Los Angeles officials had recorded 1,407 measles 
cases and six deaths by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, there were four children in Children's Hospital in San Diego because 
of measles complications, including one infant who has been on life-support 
equipment for nearly three months.

VISITS TO GIVE L.A. TASTE OF MEXICAN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The passion and controversy surrounding the 1988 Mexican presidential election 
are likely to erupt again this weekend when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
and his chief antagonist, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, come to Los Angeles to visit 
their expatriate countrymen and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual turn of events, the two men on Monday will be competing for 
favorable publicity in different parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The visits, which both sides portray as coincidental, point up some new 
realities about Mexican politics: It is now acceptable to press the flesh 
outside of Mexico, particularly in Los Angeles, which has the world's largest 
Mexican population outside Mexico City. It is the first visit here by a sitting 
Mexican president in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollars earned by Mexican workers who have come to the United States 
are becoming a potent force south of the border. In addition, the allegiances 
of Chicanos -- U.S. citizens of Mexican descent -- have become more important 
to Mexican power brokers since former Mexican President Luis Echeverria first 
suggested in the early 1970s that Chicanos were as important to Mexico as 
American Jews were to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of having some of the Mexican president's thunder stolen by Cardenas' 
simultaneous visit has irked some officials in Salinas' ruling party, but they 
are careful not to say anything that would inflame passions. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Cardenas) is a free Mexican," a government spokesman said. "He can go 
wherever he wants for whatever purpose he has." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas, the son of a revered former president of Mexico, has charged that the 
election 20 months ago was stolen from him. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles tonight, while Salinas will fly 
in Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican community of Southern California rejects and repudiates the visit 
of the so-called president of Mexico, the usurper -- Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari," thundered Cardenas supporter Pedro Arias, one of several Latino 
activists who held a news conference in Boyle Heights on Friday to protest 
Salinas' controversial election and his Los Angeles visit. 
</P>
<P>
A Salinas spokesman, who insisted on anonymity when reached in Mexico City, 
retorted: "What lies. This was the fairest election in Mexico's history. The 
president is going to Los Angeles on an unofficial visit to unite people, even 
those who throw stones at us." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas, a former governor, quit the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI) and ran under the banner of the Democratic Revolution Party, a coalition 
of left-of-center groups. Although the ruling party has won elections in the 
past with overwhelming numbers, Cardenas received an unheard-of amount of votes 
for a challenger -- 31%. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, the ruling party's candidate, was named the winner with only 50.36%, 
the lowest margin of victory in the party's 61-year history. A third candidate, 
the late Manuel J. Clouthier, was third with 17.07%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the totals, Cardenas and his supporters charged widespread voter fraud, 
something the PRI has frequently been accused of. 
</P>
<P>
While Salinas is constitutionally prohibited from seeking another six-year 
term, Cardenas has been traveling throughout the United States and Mexico since 
the election, seeking support for another try for the presidency in 1994. He 
campaigned in Los Angeles six months ago to raise funds to establish a support 
committee in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The first shots over the weekend visits were fired Friday by Cardenas' 
partisans. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want him (Salinas) here," Chicano activist Virginia Reade said at 
Friday's news conference. "He wants legitimacy in the U.S., so he has to come 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardenistas said they plan to protest Salinas' speech Monday at a meeting 
of the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. in Century City. They also 
questioned the appropriateness of Cesar Chavez, the head of the United Farm 
Workers of America, meeting with the Mexican president after the speech to 
discuss a landmark Mexican law extending medical benefits to the Mexican 
families of citizens working in the fields of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Reade and others said they would try to dissuade Chavez from appearing with 
Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the trip and the appearance with Chavez, the presidential spokesman 
in Mexico City said Salinas accepted the invitation from the newspaper 
publishers several months ago, "some time before it was known that Mr. Cardenas 
would be in Los Angeles at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
"The president is obligated to look after all Mexicans, wherever they live, and 
this legislation is part of that obligation," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, the families living in Mexico of about 100,000 farmhands 
and others would receive benefits from the Mexican equivalent of the Social 
Security Administration. Officials in Mexico City could not immediately explain 
the specifics of how the program would operate. 
</P>
<P>
The speech and the scheduled ceremony with Chavez are major items on the 
Mexican president's itinerary Monday. According to officials at the Mexican 
Consulate in Los Angeles, he also is scheduled to meet with Mexican-American 
business leaders and activists in separate meetings. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to return to Mexico City on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
While Salinas spends Monday on the Westside, Cardenas is scheduled to give 
several talks near downtown Los Angeles. He is set to appear at a morning 
fund-raiser for his local supporters at a Chinatown restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Cardenas has scheduled a meeting with editors at The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas is scheduled to attend a private party tonight in Montebello shortly 
after his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, he is one of several speakers expected to address a Santa 
Monica dinner staged by the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal 
political action group.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MALIBU CITYHOOD BACKERS SUE TO BLOCK DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of cityhood for Malibu sued the county Board of Supervisors Friday 
in a bid to prevent the board from delaying the coastal community's 
incorporation if it is approved by voters in June. 
</P>
<P>
The board, under orders from a judge, has set a June 5 cityhood election for 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the same resolution the board included language that would delay 
the actual incorporation for more than nine months after the election, until 
March 28, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court suit filed by the Malibu Committee for Incorporation 
challenged the supervisors' contention they have the jurisdiction and legal 
authority to delay the effective date of incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the supervisors nor attorneys for the county could be immediately 
reached for comment on the suit.

Federal agents arrested a 49-year-old Venice man this week as a suspect in the 
holdup of 20 banks in the Los Angeles area during the last four months, the FBI 
reported.

An FBI spokesman said agents arrested Edward Joseph Gibson in Venice without 
incident. Gibson's photograph and description had appeared in a full-page

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S DOCTORS WILL NOT FACE 
CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined Friday to press 
charges against several physicians, ending its investigation into allegations 
that they over-prescribed painkillers to actress Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
In a written report, the district attorney's office said the prescribing 
practices "fell below the accepted standard of medical practice," but added 
that the doctors "were also attempting to deal with her addiction through 
alternative means of therapy and treatment, and . . . their conduct was devoid 
of criminal intent." 
</P>
<P>
The report said one of the physicians repeatedly tried to persuade her to enter 
a rehabilitation clinic but "these efforts to intervene were strongly resisted 
by Ms. Taylor until October, 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 58, acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and painkillers 
and has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse at the Betty Ford Clinic in 
Rancho Mirage.

PLANNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster's planning director has taken a job as a vice president of an 
Encino-based development company whose controversial 2,400-home development 
proposal in semi-rural western Lancaster was approved by the city last month. 
</P>
<P>
Community Development Director Steve Harding said Friday he will leave his 
$72,500 post May 7 for a substantially better-paid post as vice president and 
project manager with The Larwin Co., developer of the 885-acre Del Sur Ranch 
project that received final council approval March 5. 
</P>
<P>
Harding said the change has nothing to do with the Del Sur project and that his 
discussions with Larwin began only after the development was approved. 
</P>
<P>
The switch, which comes 14 months after Harding took the city job, drew 
criticism from a leading Lancaster slow-growth activist and prompted one City 
Council member to say the council should discuss the move.

GROUP PROTESTS GRAFFITI AT FURNITURE WAREHOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
VANDALISM: ACTIVISTS SAY LEVITZ ENCOURAGED TAGGING IN AN AREA OF GLENDALE BY 
ALLOWING ITS WALLS TO BE USED FOR SPRAY-PAINTED MURALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Graffiti foes dumped dozens of empty spray-paint cans in front of a Glendale 
furniture warehouse Friday, contending that the establishment has encouraged a 
vandalism spree by allowing spray-can artists to paint on its walls. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 members of Valley Organized in Community Efforts, protesting outside 
the Levitz Furniture warehouse that abuts the Los Angeles River, said the 
company has aggravated the neighborhood's graffiti problems. 
</P>
<P>
Levitz, which had been plagued by graffiti, allowed some self-described 
graffiti artists to spray-paint murals on the outer walls about four months 
ago, store officials said. They hoped that taggers -- gang members and others 
who scrawl words with spray-paint or a marker -- would not deface the 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
But gang members and taggers have sprayed slurs and slogans on top of the 
murals and have also marred the walls of nearby businesses, according to VOICE 
members and neighboring merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"Levitz started this as an art contest, but they didn't control it," VOICE 
spokeswoman Martha Page said. "It's not just art. It's not just an innocent 
creative endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an invitation to gangs and drug dealers," VOICE member Barbara 
Mark-Dreyfuss said. "It turns it into a crippled, sick community." 
</P>
<P>
VOICE, which operates an anti-graffiti campaign, includes members from 19 San 
Fernando Valley religious groups and claims to represent more than 30,000 
families. In a written statement, the group charged that Levitz is "an enemy of 
responsible business and contributes to the destabilization of the local area." 
</P>
<P>
Levitz employees told the protesters that the store was not at fault for the 
rash of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way was Levitz trying to do something to harm the community," said Bill 
O'Malley, the company's group operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the protest, O'Malley said: "Our building is in the process of being 
repainted now. It will be accomplished within the next two weeks. We don't wish 
to comment further on this subject." 
</P>
<P>
The owners of two graffiti-stained businesses nearby blame Levitz for their own 
graffiti problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They started at Levitz and went to the next building and the next building," 
said Angel Ramorino, co-owner of Furniture Town. 
</P>
<P>
Ramorino said he has had to repaint the exterior of his store several times in 
recent months because of the spreading graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"There was hardly anything on our wall before Levitz started," said Larry 
Tackett, president of Trade Rotary Corp., a printing firm. "It just keeps 
getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "They'd always do it on the weekend. Somebody would paint something, 
then somebody else would paint something on top of that. I didn't mind it at 
first. It is just out of hand now." 
</P>
<P>
Members of VOICE demanded that a top Levitz official meet with the group and 
join a citywide crackdown on graffiti, but the company had no immediate 
response.

S.D. POLICE CONSIDER ELECTRONIC DRUG DETECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An electronic drug detector was given a public demonstration at police 
headquarters Friday, but drug-sniffing canines don't have to worry about losing 
their jobs. It will be several months before the department decides whether to 
buy the machine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great, and is something that applies to the San Diego Police 
Department," said Matt Weathersby, the department's community relations 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to replace dogs, and we're not competing with them," said Dr. 
David Fine, head of the drug and bomb detection program of Thermedics Inc., the 
Massachusetts-based maker of the machine. "They can be used together. The 
machine can be used to support the canine findings or to help train them." 
</P>
<P>
The detector is equipped to pick up quantities of narcotics undetectable to the 
human eye, Fine said. According to Weathersby, dogs are trained to detect 
usable or larger amounts of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to purchase the machine lies with the police administration 
office, which will judge whether it is sound, whether it is needed and whether 
the funds are available, Weathersby said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be months of testing before a decision is made," he said. "We want 
to be 100% sure that the (machine) is correct, because the evidence we gather 
has to hold up in court. Our own lab will evaluate it later and make 
comparisons." 
</P>
<P>
The $150,000 machine, called the Sentor, was observed for three days at the 
Police Department. It was demonstrated by representatives of Thermedics, which 
develops and manufactures biomedical products and analytical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Sentor is an offshoot of an explosives detector that was manufactured five 
years ago for the U. S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which protects American 
personnel in foreign countries, Fine said. The new machine is adapted to detect 
drugs, and is programmed for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. Other drugs 
can also be programmed in. 
</P>
<P>
Thermedics representatives have been in San Diego for two weeks showing their 
product to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Fine said several 
agencies are considering purchasing the device but that no contracts have been 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
The device picks up air molecules from enclosed areas such as packages, luggage 
and cars. A detachable, hand-held sampling gun sucks in air before being placed 
in a portable unit that, in 30 seconds, separates and analyzes any narcotics.

FEDERAL EXPRESS IMPOSTOR SNAGS 2 MORE IN DELIVERY SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A man posing as a Federal Express employee has tricked two more people into 
giving him cash for deliveries from non-existent state agencies, bringing the 
total to 27 victims in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 p.m. Thursday, the con artist entered Miyoko Dry Cleaning, in the 2900 
block of University Avenue, with a delivery from a fabric association in 
Sacramento, said owner Miyoko Knox. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in at a busy time, during rush hour, when people pick up clothes," 
Knox said. "He said that he was from Federal Express and had a COD package for 
me to sign for. He had my license number and the business' identification 
number matched." 
</P>
<P>
When the man left, Knox said, she opened the envelope and found three blank 
1989 tax forms. She said she called police Friday morning after a friend told 
her of a newspaper story about the scam. 
</P>
<P>
At noon Friday, the same scenario was played out at Coffees of the World, in 
the 4500 block of University Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a dummy," said Maurice Mizrahi. "All the license numbers on the 
(package) were correct, everything was correct." 
</P>
<P>
The package's return address was the State Board of Equalization, Mizrahi said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Feb. 1, police have received 27 reports from small businesses that have 
paid the man $18.50 per delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The thief, wearing either a brown or blue uniform bearing Federal Express' 
emblem, delivers envelopes stuffed with blank Internal Revenue Service forms. 
He also leaves receipts with return addresses from non-existent state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express does not deliver packages COD said police spokesman Bill 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The man is described as white, in his 40s, about 6-foot-3 and weighing 160 to 
170 pounds. He has brown, collar-length hair and was wearing clear, wire-rimmed 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said similar operations have been reported in Sacramento, Fresno, 
Orange County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the scam can call police at 696-1655.

TRAVELING ARTIST HOPES CONVERTED 'SNOWMOBILE' WILL DOUBLE AS STAR VEHICLE

<P>
Most people write resumes to get a job. Some even make a demonstration video. 
</P>
<P>
But Susan Daughtry is making her bid for stardom by driving a 31-year old bread 
truck flocked in "snow" about 3,000 miles across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Daughtry, a 48-year-old sculptor from Alabama with fiery red hair and blue 
eyes, hopes to get UMO, the truck she lovingly calls an Unidentified Moving 
Object, into a movie or music video. 
</P>
<P>
She began a two-year journey across the states last October from her hometown 
of Dothan, Ala. She bought the 1959 snub-nosed truck, abandoned in a bread 
company's lot, for $1,200 and transformed it into a moving sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 months, she labored over the vehicle, ribbing its sides with PVC piping, 
sculpting a Styrofoam-like substance over its body, and applying 13 gallons of 
white paint and 321 tubes of caulking. 
</P>
<P>
Daughtry gutted the insides, remolding the interior into bright white, living 
quarters, complete with a solar shower, single bed, portable kitchen, closet 
space, and zebra-patterned pillows. Instead of hauling a dresser on board, she 
fastened a row of white buckets to the wall to store belts, socks, makeup and 
other small items. 
</P>
<P>
Then she took UMO on its maiden voyage. "I was a nervous wreck," she said. "I 
could just see all the stuff peeling off, but everything stayed on." 
</P>
<P>
Sleeping for safety in police station parking lots, she inched her way across 
eight states, 200 miles a day. She earned her keep speaking at colleges and 
teaching children free-form sculpture, she said. She arrived in La Jolla six 
weeks ago to visit her daughter, and will give free sessions for children at 
the Artwalk downtown today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Daughtry and more than 400 other artists will participate in a two-day festival 
of music, dance, art and theater downtown on G Street between 5th Avenue and 
13th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Daughtry, who retired 10 years ago, said her journey started after she returned 
from an eight-year stint as an American expatriate living in Puerto Vallarta. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the United States after receiving a commission from an Atlanta 
museum. But she had always wanted to drive across the country, Daughtry said, 
surveying her surroundings from a parking space in La Jolla Village Square this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a maverick," she said. "I was the oldest of three children, 
and my daddy wanted a boy. So I grew up with a fishing pole in one hand and a 
gun in the other." 
</P>
<P>
Daughtry said she worked for 21 years, building up her architectural design and 
renovation company in Atlanta. "But this is the most 'out there' I've ever 
been. I'm vulnerable, interacting one to one with people. Riding inside my work 
of art, my perspective is different from if my work were in a gallery, and 
people were viewing it on a wall." 
</P>
<P>
People who get close enough to UMO to see it either smile or laugh, said 
Daughtry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's bloody wondrous," said Ken Capewell, an English visitor who 
happened by. "I love it. I just wish I had a camera." 
</P>
<P>
The truck has helped break the ice with strangers, Daughtry said. And 
invariably the first question is, "What is the truck about?" 
</P>
<P>
"Then, all of a sudden, they tell me where they're from," she said. "The truck, 
because of its humor and because it is so different, has just shot through all 
of these barriers people have. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started, I really didn't know what would take place. I just 
wanted to do it for the fun of it. It was also a way of reintroducing myself to 
my country and introducing my country to my work." 
</P>
<P>
Daughtry said she provides a tablet on which people can write their comments. 
Then she stands back from the truck to observe their reaction. One wrote, 
"Brrrr, is it cold?" Another swore it was the "Jammingest Machine Ever." 
</P>
<P>
They don't know if a male or female owns the truck, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many women are not interested in the truck. "If I have 50 people -- 25 men and 
25 women -- all 25 men will walk over, but probably 10, if that many, of the 
women would. I think it's because a vehicle is still thought of as a masculine 
object. 
</P>
<P>
"I've identified three categories of people," she said. "There are people who 
identify with the vehicle. They oooh and ah, and they want to touch it, and 
they interact with it. There is no barrier and that's wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I'll have people, when I pull up to a stop sign, they'll see it but 
they're afraid. They're full of fear of anything unusual or not the norm. They 
choose not to let it come into their space. I can tell they can see it, but 
they're afraid to show any type of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, there's the third category of people who don't see it at all. They look 
straight at it, and they just don't see it." 
</P>
<P>
Children react completely differently, she said: "Kids look at the truck, and 
their reaction is, 'I can't believe an adult did it.' 
</P>
<P>
"It is real childlike, and that is the fun part of it. This is a work of art 
that's OK to touch." 
</P>
<P>
Daughtry said she'll be leaving for Los Angeles in the next two weeks, but she 
has already had one big break. 
</P>
<P>
Harrod Blank, the son of producer Les Blank who has done documentaries on such 
things as people with spaces between their front teeth, Cajun music, food, and 
musician Lightnin' Hopkins, plans to include UMO in a film on art cars called 
"Wild Wheels." 
</P>
<P>
Usually art cars are fashioned out of Cadillacs or Volkswagen bugs, she said.

DRUG KINGPIN MATTA TELLS COURT CAPTORS BEAT, TORTURED HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted drug kingpin indicted in the murder of a U.S. drug agent in Mexico 
testified Friday that he was beaten and tortured with an electronic stun gun by 
authorities who captured him two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros -- whose 1988 arrest in his homeland of Honduras 
on U.S. drug charges sparked deadly anti-American rioting -- testified in 
federal court that he was beaten in the presence of deputy U.S. marshals and on 
an airplane from Honduras to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Matta, who was convicted last year and sentenced to life in prison, is among 19 
men, including high-ranking Mexican police officials, charged in the 1985 
torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie has warned he might dismiss charges against 
Matta related to the Camarena case if he is convinced Matta was tortured at the 
behest of U.S. law enforcement officials. A ruling on the dismissal is not 
expected for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Matta testified that he was shot numerous times with a stun gun and struck with 
other electrical devices on his back, arms, feet, hands and testicles following 
his arrest on April 5, 1988.

NUNN SHOWS NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Nunn is getting a bit too arrogant for his own good. 
</P>
<P>
His reaction to the fans' boos -- "They don't take any punches" -- indicates 
complete disregard for their feelings. One can reply, "He gets paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
Until he defeats someone of the caliber of Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns or 
Marvelous Marvin Hagler, let him realize that so far he isn't the second coming 
of Muhammad Ali.

KINGS SHOULD DO IT FOR THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings' double-overtime victory over Calgary was more than the Midnight 
Miracle on Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
It was a victory of good over evil, of a class act over bush-league tactics, of 
pure hockey over the ruthless, goon-style play made famous by Terry Crisp's 
Philadelphia teammates in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the series, the Flyers, I mean Flames, took cheap shots at the Kings 
(some the referees called; most went unpenalized). Not once did the Kings 
retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
When hockey is played with skill and finesse, as the Kings played, it is a 
beautiful game. When the sport is played with reckless, brute force, with more 
emphasis on injuring and intimidating the opponents than outscoring them, the 
game becomes ugly.

As a woman who loves sports and reads Jim Murray faithfully, the columns I

Christmas Day, 1973, on leaving his home in Malibu tugged at my heart.

<P>
Then on April 3, 1984, his lovely tribute to Gerry, "She Took the Magic and 
Happy Summer With Her." No one could read it without crying.

Thank you, Mr. Murray, for all the years of reading pleasure you have given to 
sports fans.

'TOO MUCH' GATHERS NOT ENOUGH FOR SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter on April 15, Jon K. Evans stated, "Hank Gathers died of greed" and 
berated The Times for the excellent, thoughtful, well-balanced, four-page 
article on Hank's life and tragic death. If Hank Gathers had been greedy, he 
would have opted for the NBA last year when he became only the second player in 
NCAA history to lead the nation in rebounding and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to school primarily because his mother wanted him to obtain his 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
A greedy man would have taken the easy million-dollar insurance settlement. 
Hank was greedy only of electing to pursue his lifelong dream of playing in the 
NBA despite risks to his life. "A little too much on Hank Gathers," Mr. Evans? 
For those who knew him, watched him play, or merely read about him with 
compassion and understanding, four pages were not nearly enough.

<P>
Two baseball teams headed in opposite directions met Friday for an Empire 
League game at Boysen Park. As expected, the team playing well of late -- 
Katella High School -- defeated struggling Los Alamitos, 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
Katella (15-4, 6-3 in league) has seven consecutive victories and is in sole 
possession of second place, three games behind Empire League-leading Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos, after winning its first four league games, has lost four of its 
past five and dropped out of a second-place tie. Los Alamitos is 8-11-1, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Katella's Chris Drummond (5-0), a senior right-hander, gave up three hits, 
walked two and hit a batter. 
</P>
<P>
Through six innings, the only Los Alamitos hitters who were able to figure out 
Drummond's changeup were second baseman Tyler Cashman and designated hitter 
Todd Gragnano, who both singled. 
</P>
<P>
The only Los Alamitos player to reach second base was right fielder Doug Kieck, 
who singled to lead off the seventh inning and advanced on a walk to Carlos 
Jorge. But Drummond struck out catcher Craig Voorting to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris throws strikes," Katella Coach Tim McMenamin said. "He's got confidence 
in the way our defense is playing right now behind him. He knows they're going 
to make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights, who had 11 hits, didn't waste any time against Los Alamitos 
starter William Wagner, either. 
</P>

<P>
Rob Johnson pitched a five-hit shutout and El Toro High School rolled to its 
11th consecutive victory, beating Dana Hills, 3-0, Friday in a South Coast 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson (5-1) helped the Chargers (15-5, 7-2 in league) lower their staff 
earned-run average to less than two runs per game. El Toro opened the season 
with three losses but has since won 15 of 17. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has more talent than our team two years ago that played in the 
championships at Anaheim Stadium," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team two years ago got hot in the playoffs and was on a roll for five 
rounds. This team is solid at every position with better pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills (10-9-1, 4-5) had its leadoff batter reach safely in three of the 
last four innings against Johnson, but the Dolphins' only threat came in the 
fifth, when they got two of their five hits. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wasn't overpowering -- only one strikeout -- but he benefited from 
three double plays and a nifty catch by shortstop Chris Sauritch to rob Dana 
Hills' Scott Holty of a hit in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw mostly fastballs today because my curve wasn't working," Johnson said. 
"I tried to get them out as easily as possible and get the game over with 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro scored the only run Johnson would need in the second inning. Scott 
Sebbo singled, Reggie Watkins doubled and Sal Schachter grounded out. The 
Chargers added another run on a homer by Sauritch in the third and scored an 
unearned run in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think we played that bad a game," Dana Hills Coach Bob Canary said. 
"We didn't bunch our hits together, and Rob pitched a great game. They're hot 
and playing good baseball right now." 
</P>
<P>
In other South Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 9, San Clemente 0 -- Mike Seal pitched a two-hitter, struck out 11 and 
walked five to lead visiting Irvine (11-9, 6-3). Bobby Garcia had two hits and 
scored twice, and Seal doubled and had two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley 7, Mission Viejo 6 -- Trailing, 6-3, in the bottom of the 
seventh inning, Capistrano Valley (11-7-1, 4-4-1) scored four runs. David 
Guillen's single to left scored Ian Levine with the winning run. Mission Viejo 
led, 4-0, after two innings.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY WINS ON BIXLER'S HIT IN EIGHTH

FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Fountain Valley High School celebrated its 1-0, eight-inning Sunset 
League victory over Marina, Jodi Bixler walked to home plate. 
</P>
<P>
She wanted to make sure one special red aluminum bat got back to Fountain 
Valley's dugout safely. 
</P>
<P>
It was the bat the sophomore used to hit the run-scoring double to left-center 
field in the bottom of the eighth and give seventh-ranked Fountain Valley 
(16-4, 4-0 in league play) the victory over Marina (17-5, 3-1), the 
third-ranked team in this week's Orange County Softball Coaches' Poll. 
</P>
<P>
After Shannon Dolan's two-out single, Bixler made solid contact with Willa 
Parchen's first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had this feeling," Bixler said. "I knew it was going to be my pitch. It 
was right there. I said, 'If Shannon gets on, I'm hitting her in.' 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even going to try to go to third. I was just going to stay at second 
and hope Shannon scored." 
</P>
<P>
This Fountain Valley team has more home runs than any previous Baron team this 
early in the season, Coach Cary Baker said. So Marina's outfielders were deep 
when Bixler stepped to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Their outfielders were out so far they needed tickets to get back in," Baker 
said. "(Bixler) just put it in the right spot. She has got power. She is really 
a coming player for us." 
</P>
<P>
But she almost didn't get the chance to swing away. Before the game-winner, 
Baker was about to tell Bixler to try to hit the ball on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Before Fountain Valley's back-to-back hits in the eighth inning, Parchen (9-3) 
had given up only one hit, a single to Rice in the fourth. Parchen ended with a 
three-hitter, seven strikeouts and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
Rae Rice (12-0) pitched her 11th shutout. She had nine strikeouts and one walk 
in what Baker called "her best game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Rice gave up a single in the seventh and managed to get out of a three-hit 
eighth inning without giving up a run. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's Julie Luft led off with a single. Mindy Burgess bunted and Baron 
catcher Dolan waited for it to spin foul, but it died fair for a single. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs later, Robyn Yorke singled to load the bases, bringing up .320 hitter 
Julie Muchet. Rice struck her out to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Susie Calderon wasn't disappointed with her team's play. She said 
Fountain Valley executed better, especially on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We played good defense," Calderon said. "Our bats were quiet, but Rae's an 
excellent pitcher. Willa pitched a great ballgame. She got herself out of a 
couple of jams. Unfortunately, that girl got ahold of it. 
</P>
<P>
"(Besides), they'll come to our place. Like I said in the beginning, nobody is 
going to go through the Sunset League undefeated." 
</P>
<P>
In another Sunset League game: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 4, Edison 0 -- Winning pitcher Jennifer Kimble (14-7) had two RBIs 
and Jena Sansone doubled and scored twice to lead host Ocean View (14-7, 2-2).

BUCCANEER DEADLINE THREATENS COMPLETION OF ANDERSON TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS: TAMPA BAY SAYS A CONTRACT AGREEMENT MUST BE REACHED BY 9 A.M. (PDT) 
TODAY, ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME TALK OF AN EXTENSION.

<P>
The clock is still ticking on the deal to send Charger running back Gary 
Anderson to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but time is growing short. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay set a deadline of 9 a.m. PDT today for reaching a contract agreement 
with Anderson, or the deal to exchange him for two draft picks will be off. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's agent, Peter Johnson of Cleveland, and the Buccaneers ended 
telephone negotiations Friday without coming to terms. And while no one was 
expressing deep concern over the failure to agree, Tampa Bay's chief negotiator 
did say he was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought we would have had it done by now," said Phil Krueger, 
assistant to the team president. 
</P>
<P>
Krueger said Johnson was set to arrive in Tampa today for face-to-face talks. 
Krueger said Johnson has been in Phoenix for the past few days on other 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"He's coming to Tampa Bay, that's all I can say," Krueger said. "I don't know 
if that's a positive or a negative." 
</P>
<P>
Krueger said he is intent on completing the deal by the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a firm deadline," Krueger said. "I wouldn't want it to go past noon 
(EDT)." 
</P>
<P>
But the Buccaneers nonetheless seem to be making plans in case there are 
further hitches. 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said he already has received an inquiry 
from Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins about extending the deadline and said that he 
had no objection to granting an extension if needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Ray Perkins we're flexible, if he needs more time to just call me," 
Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Anderson nor Johnson could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers agreed Thursday to trade Anderson to Tampa Bay in exchange for a 
third-round choice in the NFL draft that begins Sunday and a conditional 
second-round pick in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The second-round choice would be contingent upon Anderson gaining at least 
1,000 combined yards passing and rushing in 1990. If he failed to achieve that, 
the 1991 pick would be in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
But for the deal to be completed, league rules say Anderson must be signed to a 
contract. He has been without one since the end of 1988 and sat out last season 
when a new deal could not be reached.

USIU TO MEET WITH OTHER SCHOOLS ABOUT FORMING A NEW CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, U.S. International Athletic Director Al Palmiotto surveyed 
available Division I independents to see if there was interest in forming a new 
athletic conference. Eight of the 13 schools he contacted replied. 
</P>
<P>
On May 3, officials from prospective members will meet at USIU to discuss 
details of the proposal, giving Palmiotto a clearer idea of how close USIU is 
to reaching its goal. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Palmiotto received commitments from Chicago State, Northeastern 
Illinois, Missouri-Kansas City and Wisconsin-Milwaukee. With recent interest 
shown by Sacramento State and Cal State Northridge, the possibility of 
assembling a conference of six teams -- the minimum required by the NCAA -- has 
taken another step forward. Southern Utah and Youngstown (Ohio) State are also 
considering membership. 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto said he hopes the meeting will settle several issues, including the 
appointment of a commissioner and the naming of a director of marketing and 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to get a commitment from athletic directors and coaches," he said, "to 
resolve the sports, choose a date to venture forth and to put in our 
application (to the NCAA) and to get funding commitments for the application." 
</P>
<P>
The conference would begin in 1991-92, although the Gulls already regularly 
schedule several of the interested schools. Palmiotto said the NCAA-minimum six 
sports would most likely include men's basketball, cross county, golf, tennis, 
soccer and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the schools have some more variables to look at," Palmiotto said, "but 
we think we have six sports, and that's what's important. And we're almost all 
aligned." 
</P>
<P>
If those sports were chosen, Chicago State would have to add two sports, four 
other schools one. 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto originally had planned a private meeting with Dennis Keihn, 
Northeastern Illinois athletic director and someone with whom he has worked 
closely on the project. But Palmiotto opted for the joint meeting instead and 
said everybody but Wisconsin-Milwaukee will be there. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some great cities in Chicago, L.A. and San Diego. Those are great 
markets," Palmiotto said. "One big thing, is we're looking at schools with 
great marketing ability in their areas, and TV is a key ingredient in those 
market areas." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling long distances will still be a problem but one Palmiotto thinks will 
be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people think we're all over the place," he said, "but the fact 
is, when you join a conference, 50% of your games are home already." 
</P>
<P>
Because many of the schools are clustered in the same areas, Palmiotto said 
travel could actually improve. 
</P>
<P>
"The athletes won't be away as much on a consistent basis," he said.

MILKEN'S GUILTY PLEA; 
</P>
<P>
FOR LOWELL MILKEN, MICHAEL'S BROTHER, THE CASE IS CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken, 43, may go to prison. Lowell Milken, 41, will go home. 
</P>
<P>
The government will drop two charges of racketeering and 11 counts of fraud 
against the unassuming family man who was indicted along with his famous older 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of Lowell apparently played a central role in the final negotiations 
between Michael Milken and federal prosecutors. Michael, reportedly incensed 
that the government was using his brother as a bargaining chip, demanded that 
any plea agreement provide that all charges be dropped against Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the government reportedly insisted that Lowell plead guilty 
to at least one misdemeanor. His brother stood firm: Lowell's record had to be 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and associates of the Milkens believe that Lowell was indicted in the 
first place only to put pressure on his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is a very loyal person and very family oriented," said one source. "He 
convinced his brother to leave a promising legal career and join him at Drexel 
(Burnham Lambert). He obviously feels somewhat responsible for what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Another investment banker who worked with the brothers said he was 
"flabbergasted" that Michael Milken would agree to such stiff penalties. 
However, some said he might have been willing to pay more in order to get his 
brother's off. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to know how much pain and exhaustion he and his family have 
suffered through," said another Milken friend. 
</P>
<P>
Michael and Lowell Milken are very little alike. Michael has been the grand 
thinker, the creative genius, the one who brings in the clients. Lowell has 
remained in the background, working out the details that his brother left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Milken, 41, graduated summa cum laude from UC Berkeley and was editor of 
the law review at UCLA law school. He went to work for the Los Angeles law firm 
of Irell &amp; Manella in the early 1970s, where he specialized in business and 
tax law. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1978, he left the law firm to join his brother at Drexel's fast growing 
Beverly Hills junk bond department. There he originally managed the investments 
that Michael had been making for himself, Lowell and other Drexel employees. He 
eventually became Michael's right-hand man, advising his better-known brother 
about the finances and the risks of potential deals. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very important to Mike because he was somebody Mike trusted 
completely," said another investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lowell never traded any securities; he wasn't licensed to do so. The 
government alleged in its indictment that Lowell was involved in racketeering 
and fraud in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Lowell engaged in securities fraud by helping to 
conceal Drexel's interest in Mattel securities when the Hawthorne-based toy 
maker was involved in a financial overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
He also participated in a "stock parking" scheme involving stock speculator 
Ivan Boesky, the government alleged. Stock parking is an illegal arrangement in 
which one party agrees to temporarily buy stock from another with the 
understanding that the seller will not only repurchase the shares, but will 
indemnify the buyer from loss on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The government contended that Michael Milken "parked" 4 million shares of 
Phillips Petroleum stock for Boesky in order to inflate the level of capital 
Boesky was reporting. Lowell Milken was allegedly part of a 1986 conference

Other charges against Lowell related to the Milken brothers allegedly meeting 
with Boesky to discuss ways to reconcile their losses on the stock parking 
arrangement. The indictment also charged that Lowell later lied to cover up the 
transaction.

PENTAGON'S HIGH-TECH PROMOTER TRANSFERRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Craig Fields, who as director of the Pentagon's advanced research arm advocated 
greater government support for high-technology industries, has been reassigned 
to a new position, the Defense Department disclosed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fields, as head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, had several 
run-ins with top Administration officials over his advocacy of a more active 
government role in support of such projects as high-definition television. He 
also backed the industry-government sponsored Sematech cooperative, aimed at 
improving U.S. computer chip manufacturing capability. 
</P>
<P>
Fields, who did not return phone calls, joined DARPA in 1974 and has been its 
director for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon initially denied that Fields was being dismissed. In response to 
press inquiries, it later issued a statement acknowledging that he was being 
moved to a new position. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Fields is not being fired from any position and any such characterization 
unfairly impugns his years of fine service to the nation," the Pentagon said. 
"The department plans to transfer him to the position of deputy director of 
defense research and engineering for defense management report implementation." 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said the new position amounted to a demotion and would 
give Fields little real authority. 
</P>
<P>
Fields' dismissal as head of DARPA is likely to stir controversy in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The firing of Craig Fields represents a death blow for U.S. competitiveness," 
said Fred Branfman, director of Rebuild America, a group that advocates 
industry-government projects. "The Bush Administration has DARPA solely 
building weapons to meet the waning Soviet military threat instead of helping 
to develop economic weapons to meet the Japanese challenge." 
</P>
<P>
DARPA, which was established in the wake of the U.S. panic over Sputnik more 
than 30 years ago, awards hundreds of millions of dollars each year to 
corporations and universities to conduct financially high-risk research. 
</P>
<P>
DARPA currently is funding private R&amp;D in such technologies as 
superconductivity, advanced semiconductors, high-definition TV, neural networks 
and similar ventures. While DARPA is confined to projects with a military 
application, many of the technologies it funds are also expected to help U.S. 
industries.

Reebok Tries Again: Reebok is back with its provocative "bungee" jumping 
commercial for its "the Pump" athletic shoes. 
</P>
<P>
That ad, which shows two men leaping from a high bridge with their shoes tied 
to special ropes that are supposed to protect them from hitting the water, 
caused a stir when it first aired last month. Reebok quickly pulled the ad. But 
a new version of it -- with written warnings not to try the stunt -- is airing 
again on CBS and ABC on "selective" programming after 10 p.m, Reebok said in a 
statement. NBC still refuses to air the ad.

MEXICO ALLOWS NEWSPAPERS TO IMPORT OWN NEWSPRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican newspapers can now import their own newsprint, free of government 
control, for the first time in 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a move he said would reinforce the independence of the press, President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Friday opened the border to newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
Imports will be subject to a 15% tariff but no other restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, newsprint could be imported or manufactured only by a government 
monopoly called Pipsa, for the initials of its name in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very significant decision," said Alejandro Junco, publisher of 
Monterrey-based El Norte newspaper and for two decades a leader in the fight to 
break Pipsa's monopoly. "Mr. Salinas has earned himself the respect of those 
who think it important for Mexican journalism not to have the stigma of 
government dependence." 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1974, the feisty El Norte's paper supply was cut to 17% of the 
previous month's level while competitors were allowed an unlimited paper 
supply, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when Salinas offered last year to sell the company, publishers 
objected, saying control by a private monopoly would be worse. 
</P>
<P>
Pipsa will continue to operate as a state-owned company, Salinas said. However, 
he added, "Now, journalists and publishers can get their paper supplies from 
the source they consider most appropriate, depending on their location, 
interests and the (press) size." 
</P>
<P>
Junco predicted that newspapers near the border will begin to import newsprint, 
while those near Pipsa mills will continue to buy newsprint from the company. 
"If we see fit, we will (import)," he said.

DISCOVERY: ELVA MAY SCHOOL OF FLORAL DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ada Kelly, a student at the Elva May School of Floral Design, stepped back from 
the work table and admired her latest creation. "All I've ever done before this 
was go out and pick a rose," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a retired laboratory technician, plans to work part time in a flower 
shop after finishing a four-week basic course. The soft lilac and pink-toned 
arrangement was the third she'd made since enrolling in the small, family-run 
school in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, John McElrath, a former military aircraft mechanic, was busy putting 
the final touches on his arrangement. "After fixing planes for 16 years, I felt 
like I was in a rut," he says. "I wanted something more individual and 
creative." 
</P>
<P>
He decided to team up with his sister, who ran a flower shop in Garden Grove. 
As the new co-owner, he handled deliveries and purchasing. But after he tried 
his hand at floral design, he liked it so much he decided to get professional 
training. "It's relaxing," he explains. "And I can see the whole thing through 
from start to finish." 
</P>
<P>
The school was founded in 1947 by Elva May Devlin, a Fullerton florist who also 
founded the American Institute of Floral Designers, a nationwide professional 
organization. The school's present owner, Randall Stark, purchased it from 
Devlin 12 years ago and retained the original name. 
</P>
<P>
Although no official certification is needed to work as a florist, it is 
difficult for those with no experience to find 
</P>
<P>
entry-level jobs, according to Stark. "There are only about 20 other schools 
like this in the U.S.," he says. It is the only floral design school in 
California certified 
</P>
<P>
by the state Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the elements of design, the school's curriculum includes proper 
buying, marketing and handling techniques. "We try to teach students 
cost-control concepts right from the start," says director Steve Stark, owner 
Randall's son. "Even though it's creative work, it's still a business. We try 
to point out the common pitfalls." 
</P>
<P>
Students are taught traditional approaches as well as more exotic European and 
Asian concepts. Courses are taught in topical segments and include instruction 
in wedding, party and sympathy designs. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone: 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday 
</P>
<P>
Address: 410 W. Amerige Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone: (714) 525-8464 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment: Tuition for the basic, four-week course is $1,250, plus a $50 
registration fee. Experienced florists may enroll in segments of the basic 
course and attend special workshops held throughout the year.

Although the number of marriages being performed in the county dipped in 1989 
from the 1988 level, some couple was saying their "I do's" about once every 37 
minutes last year. As anyone who has waltzed down the aisle can attest, a

PHOTOGRAPHY: DEVELOP ART BY INSTALLING YOUR OWN DARKROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A home darkroom, much like photography itself, is limited only by your 
imagination and ingenuity -- and the amount of money, space and plumbing 
available to you. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a black-and-white darkroom in your home can easily be justified 
when you realize how difficult it is to get high-quality prints from your local 
developing shop. OK, that's stretching it. Let's just say that there's a 
certain satisfaction in finishing the process you start when taking a picture. 
</P>
<P>
Today's fast-paced lifestyle isn't conducive to a hobby that requires so much 
time and effort. People are more used to a world of instant gratification 
provided by video cameras and color prints from one-hour photo labs. But for 
photo enthusiasts, black-and-white printing remains an art, with room for 
personal interpretation of the print. 
</P>
<P>
Your first darkroom doesn't have to be elaborate. In fact, my first one was 
temporarily set up in a spare bedroom. I didn't have running water, just a few 
trays and an enlarger. All the print washing was done in the bathroom down the 
hall. If all you need to develop are snapshots of your family and friends, a 
setup such as this should suit you. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer a more elaborate arrangement, find an unused bathroom. Build a 
countertop above the bathtub for trays and a small table over the toilet for 
the enlarger. 
</P>
<P>
Ventilation is usually the most overlooked item in a home darkroom. You will be 
working for hours over open trays containing developer and fixer; it's 
important that you install an exhaust fan to bring fresh air into the room. 
</P>
<P>
Design your darkroom for future needs: While you may begin by printing 
8-by-10-inch prints, you may step up to 11-by-14-inch or 16-by-20-inch prints. 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Mark McGregor of Costa Mesa based his selection of an apartment on 
its darkroom potential: He selected one with a laundry room that could be 
converted into a darkroom. He now has a darkroom with running water but has to 
take his laundry out. For him, it's a small price to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape photographer Robert Tracy built his darkroom in an extra bedroom on 
the second floor of his Irvine home 18 years ago. "There are a lot of things 
you can build yourself, like print washers, sinks, light-tight drawers and 
cabinets for storage, and save yourself a lot of money," Tracy said. 
</P>
<P>
Outfitting your darkroom will require these necessities: 
</P>
<P>
Enlarger -- No expense should be spared when purchasing an enlarger and lens 
because they are the most important elements in a darkroom. Select an enlarger 
that will work with your camera's format. Read the classified ads or peruse the 
photo swap meets for used enlargers; they generally last a lifetime if properly 
cared for. 
</P>
<P>
Darkness -- Blacken or cover any windows in the room since you need total 
darkness for processing black-and-white film. Use plywood cut to size if you 
have a permanent setup or tape black plastic to the windows if this is a 
temporary installation. Block out the light from under the door or light from 
an appliance (such as a telephone). Film can be ruined during the processing 
stage by the smallest flash of light. Safelights need to be kept far enough 
away from the paper to prevent light exposure from causing it to fog. 
</P>
<P>
Sink -- Install a sink large enough to hold trays while you work. Use the same 
sink for processing film and making prints. Stainless steel or fiberglass sinks 
are available in different sizes, or you can build one with a wood frame 
covered with fiberglass. The most important factors for an easy operation are 
proper drainage and height. 
</P>
<P>
Containers -- Use high-quality storage containers to store your chemicals and 
keep the containers accurately marked. 
</P>
<P>
Wash -- Select a washing method that fits your budget. A tray with a Kodak 
siphon doesn't offer the highest capacity, but it's functional and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
Wet and dry -- You'll need two sides to your darkroom: The wet side holds the 
chemicals, trays and tanks and the dry side has the printing equipment, light 
table and paper. Mount boards, mounting equipment and a mat cutter are best 
stored away from the wet area (in another room if possible) to avoid 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Accessories -- First priorities would include tanks, reels and a timer which 
are needed for developing film, and graduates to be used for measuring 
chemicals. There's an unlimited amount of darkroom accessories; upgrade yours 
by adding an easel for paper, a grain focuser, a paper safe, burning and 
dodging tools and a storage system for negatives and prints.

GATHERS SUIT ASKS FOR $32.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON and ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Beverly Hills attorney representing the family of Hank Gathers filed a 
$32.5-million suit Friday claiming the former basketball star died because of 
questionable and negligent medical practices, and a conspiracy between Loyola 
Marymount Coach Paul Westhead and doctors to ensure Gathers would continue 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a Loyola Marymount basketball player, collapsed March 4 at Gersten 
Pavilion while playing in a West Coast Conference tournament game, and was 
pronounced dead 1 hour 40 minutes later at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. An 
autopsy determined the cause of death to be cardiomyopathy, a heart disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The 52-page complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court by attorney 
Bruce Fagel, names 14 defendants and cites six causes of action. It was filed 
on behalf of Gathers' mother, Lucille, brothers Derrick and Charles, and an 
aunt, Carol Livingston. It is the first suit to be filed in connection with 
Gathers' death. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 defendants are Loyola Marymount University and four Loyola employees -- 
Athletic Director Brian Quinn, Westhead, trainer Chip Schaefer and Dr. Dan 
Hyslop of the university's Health Services. Doctors named are internist Michael 
Mellman and his company, Mellman and Moe; cardiologists Vernon Hattori and 
Charles Swerdlow and their company, Apex Cardiology Consultants; Ralph 
Gambardella, Clarence Shields and Benjamin Schaeffer, all Loyola team 
physicians supplied by the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Group, which also was named. 
</P>
<P>
One of the actions -- fraudulent concealment -- charges that Westhead and Quinn 
conspired with Hattori, Swerdlow and Mellman and team physicians to conceal 
medical information from Gathers and his family so that he would continue 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also charges Gathers' condition was more serious than he or his family 
was informed. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Westhead -- not Gathers -- at least twice requested that 
Hattori change or reduce Gathers' heart medication, the beta blocker Inderal, 
to improve his performance on the basketball court. One of the side effects of 
the drug is sluggishness. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead denied the allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
"As his coach, I did my best for Hank Gathers," Westhead said in a statement 
Friday. "I was never part of the medical decisions concerning Hank. I did not 
decide what medication to prescribe or what dosage to take. I feel badly that 
my relationship with Hank and his family could be distorted with this legal 
action." 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference Friday, Fagel displayed a copy of a letter from medical 
records that was written by Hattori to Mellman and dated Jan. 29. In the 
letter, Hattori states that he and Gathers met the week before to discuss 
whether or not Gathers was satisfied with his level of performance. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Gathers) indicated to me at that time that he felt his performance was 
fine, and that there were no depressing effects of the medication at the dose 
he was taking. Later on over the weekend, I got a call from his coach, 
indicating that his athletic performance was still substantially sub-par, and 
that he (Westhead) felt strongly that the medication should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I met with Hank again today (Jan. 29), and had another discussion with him . . 
. I did emphasize . . . that a changeover to that agent (another drug) would 
require at least four to five days with the possibility of missing a game 
during the adjustment period. Hank felt that decreasing Inderal from 40 
(milligrams) three times a day to 40 twice a day would be his preference. I 
therefore decreased his dosage to that level and plan on repeating a Holter 
(monitor) examination in 48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel claims there was no need to reduce Gathers' medication on Jan. 29 because 
Gathers was playing well. Gathers averaged 29 points in four games between Jan. 
19-27. Fagel also claims that Westhead called Hattori March 2, two days before 
Gathers died, and pressured him to further reduce the medication to 20 
milligrams twice a day. Fagel, who says Hattori related the March 2 
conversation with the family, says that Hattori complied with the alleged 
request. 
</P>
<P>
C. Snyder Patin, attorney representing Hattori, said he would not discuss the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"We will try our case in a court of law," he said. "We think it is 
unprofessional for the plaintiffs' attorney to act in the way they have been 
acting, attempting to generate publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Patin said in California jurors are instructed to make a decision on the issue 
of medical negligence exclusively on the testimony of expert witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
In questioning the medical practices, Fagel asserted that doctors allowed 
Gathers to return to the court before performing all necessary tests. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that a Dec. 26 test, which came five days after Gathers was 
released to the team, revealed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which is 
a rapid heartbeat caused by abnormal impulses from a single area of the heart. 
The disorder can produce symptoms of fainting, dizziness, weakness and 
eventually unconsciousness leading to cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The test showed a rate of almost 200 beats per minute, far above an acceptable 
level. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges the Dec. 26 test showed Gathers should not have been allowed 
to play. The suit cited recommendations in a 1985 article from the Journal of 
America College of Cardiology, which was written from the Bethesda Conference's 
"Cardiovascular Abnormalities in the Athlete," and is considered to be basic 
guidelines by cardiologists. 
</P>
<P>
The article states that patients who have structural disease, a history of 
syncope, ventricular tachycardia exceeding 150 beats per minute during exertion 
and other problems "may not engage in competitive sports." 
</P>
<P>
It further states that patients who experience no problems for six months while 
using an antiarrhythmic drug such as Inderal could participate in low intensity 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"What was the rush to get him back on the court?" Fagel asked. "The timing of 
these tests do not make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Other allegations charge negligence by Hyslop, Schaeffer and trainer Schaefer 
when Gathers collapsed. The complaint states that they did "nothing of a 
medical nature for Gathers for a period in excess of 2 minutes and 45 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Martin L. Burke, attorney for Loyola Marymount, said: "We expect the University 
and its members will be fully vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
Burke and the other defending attorneys have 60 days to answer the complaint 
before depositions will begin. 
</P>
<P>
University officials said in a statement: "Loyola Marymount University is 
deeply saddened by the charges leveled at the University and members of the 
University's staff." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said he filed the suit on a legal "fast-track," which, if accepted, could 
mean a trial date within 12 to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the news conference were Adrian Moody and Martin Krimsky, the 
Philadelphia attorneys who represent Gathers' son, Aaron Crump, 6. Krimsky and 
Moody plan to file a wrongful death suit on behalf of Aaron in two weeks. Once 
filed, it will be combined with Fagel's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Krimsky also said he will file a $1-million suit on behalf of the Gathers' 
estate, of which he is administrator.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER SECOND TIME AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, explaining Eddie Murray's sub-par season last year, 
said it takes awhile for hitters to adjust to the pitchers in a different 
league. Also, he said players tend to try too hard, trying to justify the deal 
the club made for them. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy's second year is always better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds good, but look at the first-year accomplishments of the following 
players after switching leagues: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dick Stuart, Pittsburgh to Boston: In 1963, he hit a career-high 42 home 
runs and led the American League in runs batted in with 118. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Robinson, Cincinnati to Baltimore: In 1966, he won the American 
League triple crown and led the Orioles to the World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Al Oliver, Texas to Montreal: In 1982, he led the National League in 
hitting and RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Kingman, New York Mets to Oakland: In 1984, he had a career-high 118 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kirk Gibson, Detroit to the Dodgers: In 1988, he was the National League 
MVP and hit a homer for the ages in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
And how did they do in their second seasons? Not as well. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the members of the all-switch-hitting infield for the Dodgers 
in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Signals over: If you think Morning Briefing sometimes makes bad mistakes, how 
about this one: "ALLENTOWN, Pa. AP -- The Associated Press reported erroneously 
on April 11 that hummingbirds should be fed four parts sugar to one part water. 
The proportion should be reversed." 
</P>
<P>
Add forgettable quotes: According to Tom Verducci of Newsday, after San Diego 
swept a series from San Francisco, Mark Parent of the Padres sent this message 
to the Giants: "You guys aren't ever going to be competing with us this year. 
And pretty soon we'll be sending the same message to the Reds." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati took two out of two from San Diego. In the first game, Parent struck 
out in the ninth inning with the potential winning runs aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: Jack Nicklaus was quoted by Tom Callahan in the 
Washington Post as saying: "I remember the first time I broke 70. I was 13, 
working in the drugstore with my father. We slipped away to play nine holes 
before dinner, and I had 35 on the front nine. I begged him to go on. No, he 
said, Mom had dinner cooking. But if we ate fast, and were careful of her 
feelings, we could be back in 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Later, needing an eagle on the last hole for 69, I hit a driver and a 2- or 
3-iron, and made a long rainbow putt. I think that's when my father decided I 
had a better future as a golfer than as a stock boy." 
</P>
<P>
Same old story: From Phoenix Sun forward Tom Chambers, looking to the NBA 
playoffs: "As long as Magic (Johnson) is running the show, the Lakers are the 
team to beat for the whole thing. When it comes down to it, who would you 
rather have the ball (than him) down the stretch in a big game?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Wes Parker, 1b; Jim Lefebvre, 2b; Jim Gilliam, 3b; Maury Wills, 
ss. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Chuck Person of the Indiana Pacers, sending a message to the 
Philadelphia 76ers: "If we play them in the playoffs, Charles Barkley better 
call Michael Jordan and get a box of Wheaties." HARLEY TINKHAM

PULITZER COMMITTEE FINALLY DID ITS DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, in fact the last year the Baltimore Orioles won the World 
Series, Jim Murray, a sports columnist for The Los Angeles Times, wrote that 
"Baltimore, the team, is a lot like the city. Monotonous. It's like watching 
nine guys run a lathe. Or mow a lawn. . . . The weather is like the team. Gray. 
Colorless. Drab. . . . It would be a great place to stage 'Hamlet,' but not 
baseball games. It doesn't really rain; it just kind of leaks. You get the 
picture of Baltimore as a guy standing on a corner with no place to go and the 
rain dripping off his hat. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The ballpark looks like the Christians and lions are coming on next. It's not 
a ruin exactly. More like a Civil War monument. They forgot to put the roof on. 
A plane once crashed in the upper deck here. Some said he thought it was an old 
tobacco shed." 
</P>
<P>
And they gave this guy the Pulitzer Prize last week? 
</P>
<P>
You bet they did, although they took their sweet time about it. If the award 
had come much later in Murray's career, Willard Scott would have had to make 
the announcement. When asked for a reaction, Murray, typically, said he thought 
it was great because the award would make it easier for the obit writers. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he doesn't need the imprimatur of some self-important committee that 
should have recognized long ago what everyone in my business has understood for 
years. All the obit boys would have to say, sometime in the distant future, is 
that Jim Murray was the greatest sportswriter who ever lived and leave it at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest? Didn't he take a stiletto to Baltimore and make like Zorro? Sure. 
And it caused quite a stir at the time. What people didn't understand is that 
for a city to get the Murray treatment is not unlike Shakespeare writing about 
some dead king. It's a kind of immortality. In fact, civic leaders from 
Spokane, Wash., a town in desperate need of some immortality, once begged 
Murray to add their city to his long hit list. 
</P>
<P>
"The only trouble with Spokane, Wash., as a city," Murray began, "is that 
there's nothing to do after 10 o'clock. In the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Murray is different from other sportswriters, which is to say better, of 
course. He is unique. He is the prince of hyperbole, who never met a straight 
line he didn't like. And no matter how broad a brush he uses to paint his word 
pictures, Murray's tend to come out looking like the "Mona Lisa." 
</P>
<P>
At the Indy 500, he wrote, "Gentleman, start your coffins." 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to writing after losing one eye to a detached retina, he 
wrote, "Old Blue Eye is back." 
</P>
<P>
He warns his readers not to play cards with a guy named Doc, and when Casey 
Stengel died, he wrote, "Well, God is getting an earful today." 
</P>
<P>
He has profiled a thousand athletes, and I swear to you that each one of them, 
no matter how famous, has the column framed and hanging on a wall somewhere. 
It's a kind of immortality. Other writers fill in the blanks, tell you the 
count on the home run, give you the details. Murray, who started out on the 
Hollywood beat for Time magazine, has made the games and the people come alive 
in his columns for 30-odd years now, sometimes as often as five days a week. 
And, finally, the Pulitzer committee had to say as much. 
</P>
<P>
Before Murray, there were only three sportswriters to have won a Pulitzer. All 
of them wrote for the New York Times, a great newspaper that cares little about 
the games it covers. Murray's award was an award for all of us who do care. It 
said that sports was important, or at least as important as drama or opera. It 
also said that satire was satire, whether the topic was the Orioles or Dan 
Quayle. It said that great writing was great writing, although Murray would 
probably have none of that. A gentle, modest man, who has never understood the 
fuss made over him, Murray likes to sum up his career by saying it would have 
been better to have been a failed playwright. 
</P>
<P>
But Murray writes truth, the essence of any great writer. And like many who 
deal in humor, he is at his best when serious, when he tells us of the loving 
wife who died or of the slaughter of the Israeli innocents -- and our innocence 
-- at Munich. He can even write a great column about moving, if the move is 
from the beaches of Malibu to the safe and solid life inland. He wrote: "I will 
envy you when I hear rain falling on pavement, and I know you are watching my 
storm come in -- long gray veils of rain sweeping in from the tossing seas, 
leaving the temples of the mountains with the hoar of mist, what the poet calls 
'the compassionate sweet laughter of the rain, the gray-eyed daughter of the 
mist above the flawed and driven tide.' Then, and not only then, but mostly 
then, will I miss my lovely, lost land, my sunset, my ocean, my 18 Christmases 
by the side of my lovely sea." 
</P>
<P>
And on another day, with deadline calling, he could summon up these words: "I 
said New York was the largest chewing gum receptacle in the world. . . . I said 
Minneapolis and St. Paul didn't like each other, and from what I could see, I 
didn't blame either of them. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Is L.A. such a big deal?' they ask. No, it's not. It's under-policed and 
over-sexed. . . . It's 400 square miles of slide area. One minute you're 
spreading a picnic lunch on the Palisades and the next you're treading water in 
the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
I was once a young writer on The Los Angeles Times, and like all young writers 
on The Times, I wanted to be Jim Murray. I tried. You don't know how hard I 
tried. Finally, an old hand came to me and said, "Son, there's only one Jim 
Murray. Try to be somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
I came to settle for just knowing the man and reading him every day and 
understanding what the word "inimitable" means. And when I decided to leave Los 
Angeles to come to the Baltimore Sun, Murray came up to me, put his arm around 
my shoulder and said straight-faced, "Mike, did they tell you it was 
Baltimore?" Honest to God.

NEW AMERICAN SAYS HE STILL HAS MUCH TO PROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since January, it has not been Roberto Guerrero of Colombia it has been Roberto 
Guerrero of Columbia, as in the gem of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
On the 19th day of the year, Guerrero was sworn in as a U.S. citizen, trading 
the Colombia behind his name in Indy car racing results for San Juan 
Capistrano, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of that, too," he said Friday, after practicing for Sunday's 
Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if only he could make a strong showing in a Long Beach race. 
</P>
<P>
And if only people would believe him when he says he is fine, suffering no 
lingering effects of an accident during testing at Indianapolis in September of 
1987 that left him unconscious for 17 days with severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He is more than willing to prove himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to finish it," he said of the race. "It's my local race -- I only 
live 40 miles from here -- and I've run here two years in Formula One and five 
times in Indy cars and never finished. I don't even ask to win, just to finish. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I know when that happens I won't be satisfied, but for now, that's 
all I want here, just to finish." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Guerrero is racing for Pat Patrick's highly regarded team, 
which last year prepared the cars in which Emerson Fittipaldi won the 
Indianapolis 500 and the national Indy car title, that would seem a modest 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Things change fast in Indy car racing, though, and Patrick's team of 1990 bears 
little resemblance to the '89 version. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi is gone, for one thing, having joined Roger Penske. And Patrick's 
former partner, Chip Ganassi, split after last season, too, taking the team's 
Penske-Chevrolets with him. 
</P>
<P>
So now, the Patrick team is running unproved March-Alfa Romeos, supposedly 
improved versions of the largely experimental cars that Guerrero drove with 
little distinction in the last two-thirds of last season. The cars weren't 
ready at the start of the season and had trouble finishing once they got to the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
So, for all the Patrick team has going for it, it also is facing formidable 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero, though, is happy to be aboard. He is back with Morris (Mo) Nunn, the 
engineer with whom he has enjoyed most of success; team manager Jim McGee is 
acknowledged as one of the best in the business, and the organization of the 
Patrick team rivals the renowned Penske outfit. 
</P>
<P>
"The new engine is a big improvement over last year," Guerrero said. "They're 
making progress and they're working on it all the time. Hopefully, next year 
everybody will want an Alfa. Seeing the commitment (Alfa Romeo has) and the 
money they are spending . . . it has to work. Now, having this team's guidance 
as well, we're making progress a lot faster than last year. Eventually, we're 
going to have a great package. We've already got a great team." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero said he, too, is in great shape: "I feel better than I have for many 
years. I haven't been more excited for the season, I can't remember since 
when." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he had to "audition" to keep his ride or believes he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very confident in myself and I knew I had a good relationship with 
Alfa, and I knew they supported me 100%," Guerrero said. "It was just (a matter 
of) convincing the rest of the parties. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, Miller's (beer) wanted to sponsor the team, but they weren't too 
happy to do it at the time with me. They wanted an American driver," he said, 
laughing, and added, "They got an American driver now. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say on the team side, they've never admitted it and I don't think they 
ever will, but they wanted to make sure, like everybody else, that I was still 
OK after the accident." 
</P>
<P>
So, using one of last year's Penske-Chevrolets, the team went to Memphis to get 
a look at Guerrero in a competitive car. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me, before we really got going with the Alfa program, to get a 
feeling of a really good chassis and a really good engine. It served its 
purpose because we tested first with this car -- it was the first place we 
tested -- and we got a straight back-to-back from the Penske-Chevrolet to the 
March-Alfa. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the reason I was doing that test, but I think the other was part of 
it, too. But they never admitted it." 
</P>
<P>
Passing tests was sort of an off-season pastime for Guerrero, who also had to 
prove his worth as a potential citizen. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to speak and write English, and that was no problem for me," he said. 
"But you also have to know United States history and government. I didn't know 
any of that, and when they gave me the books, I only had a few days to learn. 
Now I feel I know more than some (native-born) American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
And if he can finish Sunday's race, he might be well on his way to proving that 
he is fine -- and exactly the driver who ought to be helping Pat Patrick's team 
show the racing world that a March-Alfa is the wave of the future in Indy cars.

LONG BEACH GRAND PRIX; 
</P>
<P>
UNSER JR. QUALIFIES ACCORDING TO PAST FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There seems to be something special about the Long Beach street course as far 
as Al Unser Jr. is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Little Al, whose father Big Al has won four Indianapolis 500s, is on a streak. 
He has won the last two Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach races in the PPG/CART 
Indy car series. Last year, he also won his first Indy car pole on the 11-turn, 
1.67-mile temporary circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, in the first day of qualifying for Sunday's $1-million race, he was 
again fastest. 
</P>
<P>
Unser, 28 Thursday, drove his Lola T9000, powered by a Chevrolet Indy V-8 
engine, at an average speed of 89.196 m.p.h. He had qualified at 90.740 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my favorite place to race, next to Indianapolis," Unser said. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Andretti, a four-time winner at Long Beach -- once in Formula One and 
three times in Indy cars -- was second fastest at 88.813 and his son, Michael, 
was third at 88.508. The Andrettis also drive Lola-Chevrolets. 
</P>
<P>
The three have accounted for all the victories in the six Indy car races held 
in Long Beach: 1984, 1985 and 1987 by Mario, 1986 by Michael and 1988 and 1989 
by Unser. 
</P>
<P>
Another qualifying session today at 11:30 a.m. could shuffle the field for the 
start of Sunday's 1 p.m. race. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the more we run here, the slower the track gets," Unser said, "but 
with the overcast skies it's likely to stay more consistent this year. I don't 
know if my time will stand up or not." 
</P>
<P>
Unser said the reduced speeds this year are due to the 1990 rules that limit 
downforce in the cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I can feel the difference in all the (11) corners," he said. "There just isn't 
as much grip to the ground as there was a year ago. One second doesn't sound 
like much, but it makes a significant difference in the feeling you get in a 
lap. 
</P>
<P>
"It will make for a better race, though, because there are more cars bunched 
together at the top of the field." 
</P>
<P>
Unser might have had a faster lap, but he missed a shift toward the end of the 
course, and before he could get around again, the session ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I was chasing Sully (Danny Sullivan), trying to get a draft on him and got so 
anxious that I missed a shift,"Under said. "Bobby Rahal was right back of me, 
so I figured I'd hook up with him and go around for a fast one. But when we got 
to the start-finish line they were waving the checkered flag. I just threw away 
that last lap." 
</P>
<P>
Despite having the fastest lap, Unser said his car actually was five to seven 
m.p.h. slower than many of the top cars on the straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why, but we're going out there tonight to see if we can find 
out," he said. "We have some ideas we are going to try, and we'll give them a 
good going over during practice in the morning and hope they work in the second 
(qualifying) session." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Cheever, making his first Indy car start at Long Beach after driving in 
four Formula One races there, is in ninth position with a 87.123 m.p.h. lap. 
</P>
<P>
"This track is completely different than when I ran here seven years ago," 
Cheever said. "It took me a while to learn the course, and I still have some to 
go. I was surprised to see so many different types of asphalt and cement. Some 
are gooey and some are slick. This makes it hard to get the proper set-up in 
the car." 
</P>
<P>
Cheever is driving the 1989 Penske PC-18 that Emerson Fittipaldi drove last 
year when he won the Indianapolis 500 and the PPG Cup driving championship. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to contrast Indy cars and Grand Prix cars, Cheever said: "When you're 
driving, it doesn't make much difference whether you're on a bicycle or in a 
Lear jet -- a race car is a race car. The Indy cars are a little heavy on the 
slow corners, but once you get going, it's fine. It's obvious that the cars 
were designed for the big speedways, but they are very good on a road course." 
</P>
<P>
Willy T. Ribbs, who will become the first black driver in a sanctioned Indy car 
race, was in 17th position after a fast lap of 85.234 m.p.h., but he did not 
seem overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"We were way off balance," he said. "We're trying to get it right, and we need 
to finish our debriefing session in order to make some improvements. I'm 
approaching this just the same as any other race -- as a professional. I'm just 
out there running with the boys." 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet-powered cars finished in seven of the first eight positions. Only Teo 
Fabi, in a year-old March-Porsche, broke through the domination, qualifying 
fifth at 88.013. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chevrolets were expected to dominate, driving one did not ensure 
success. Arie Luyendyk and 55-year-old A. J. Foyt found that out. They are 18th 
and 22nd, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to today's Indy car qualifying, there will be a Toyota 
pro-celebrity race at 1 p.m. and an International Motor Sports Assn. Chevron 
GTO-GTU race at 4:15 p.m.

Top-seeded Monica Seles of Yugoslavia cruised into the semifinals of the Eckerd 
Open Friday with a 6-2, 6-0 victory over No. 8-seeded Susan Sloane at Largo, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Seles will meet No. 3 Conchita Martinez of Spain, the defending champion, who 
beat Cammy MacGregor, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain also advanced to the semifinals with a 
6-3, 6-2 victory over No. 6 Helen Kelesi of Canada. She will face No. 4 
Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria, who beat No. 7 Sandra Ceccini of Italy, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago in Houston, Maleeva beat Sanchez Vicario. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, the world's third-ranked player, needed only 44 minutes to defeat 
Sloane, who was unable to hold serve in any of her seven service games. Seles, 
who has dropped only five games in three matches, won the last 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Her serve didn't hurt me," said Seles, 16, who has won 13 consecutive matches. 
"I don't feel I'm playing that well, but I'm doing enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Jay Berger, the last of the seeded players, was ousted from the 
$260,000 Phillips Open by Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union, 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, 
at Nice, France. 
</P>
<P>
Cherkasov, ranked 67th in the world, won 14 of the last 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal, Juan Aguilera of Spain beat Jakob Hlasek of 
Switzerland, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The two remaining French players split. Guy Forget beat Goran Prpic of 
Yugoslavia, 7-6 (9-7), 6-2, while 17-year-old Fabrice Santoro lost to Marc 
Rosset, a 19-year-old Swiss, 6-0, 5-7, 6-2.

DOUGLASS-COODY INCREASE LEAD TO 6

<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Douglass and Charles Coody birdied six holes in a row and nine of their 
last 11 Friday to expand their lead to six strokes after two rounds of the 
Legends of Golf tournament at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The runaway leaders combined for a 10-under-par 62 and completed 36 holes in 
121, a record 23-under par in the 13-year-old better-ball event. The record was 
122, set by Don January and Sam Snead in 1982 at Onion Creek, a par-70 course. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass and Coody broke that mark with two eagles, 20 birdies and a lone bogey 
in two trips over the par-72 Barton Creek course, which is being used for the 
first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of those birdies came Friday, with Coody accounting for six and Douglass 
five. Most came on a six-in-a-row string beginning on the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tickled to death," said Coody, the 1971 Masters champion, who did the 
bulk of the work in a first-round 59. "It's another nice score, but we didn't 
play particularly well in some spots." 
</P>
<P>
But some spectacular putting helped them increase their advantage. Coody made a 
40-footer for par on the 16th hole and Douglass birdied the last two holes with 
putts of more than 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The putts are continuing to go in, but we can't count on that continuing for 
two more days," Douglass said. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Al Geiberger and Harold Henning are in second place. 
Geiberger scored an eagle-3 as he and Henning matched the leaders' 62 and 
reached the halfway point at 127, 17-under par but six behind. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gallagher Jr. posted three birdies and a bogey for his second consecutive 
round of 70 and a one-stroke lead over a bunched-up field at the midway point 
of the Greater Greensboro Open at Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly because of the high rough at Forest Oaks Country Club, most players 
failed to make any ground on par, despite favorable weather. 
</P>
<P>
Four golfers were at three-under-par 141, seven were at 142, 10 were at 143 and 
another 10 were at 144. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 32 of the 155 players who started the tournament shot par or better, an 
unusual experience for a course that generally yields low scores. 
</P>
<P>
The cut was at 147, and that eliminated Curtis Strange, who had a 150, to end a 
streak of 17 tournaments in which he had survived the first two days. Payne 
Stewart, who won the Heritage tournament last weekend, also was eliminated with 
a 148. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, it looked as if Phil Blackmar would begin a charge, climbing to 
six-under through 15 holes. But his tee shot at 16 landed in a fairway bunker 
and led to a double-bogey six.

NEWSWIRE: COLTS SIGN GEORGE FOR $15 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Indianapolis Colts signed Jeff George to a six-year, $15-million contract 
that will make the Illinois quarterback the highest-paid rookie in NFL history 
and put him among the four highest-paid players in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Among current players, George's package would rank below only those of 
Buffalo's Jim Kelly and Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
It is equal to the contract of Cleveland's Bernie Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
George's contract surpasses the six-year, $11-million deal that quarterback 
Troy Aikman signed with the Dallas Cowboys last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what I've always dreamed of doing, and here I am," George said when he 
arrived at Colt headquarters Friday. "I am very excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
George, an Indianapolis native, played one year at Purdue but transferred to 
Miami after Coach Leon Burtnett was fired. He never played for the Hurricanes 
and left for Illinois the next year. George, who passed up his senior year of 
eligibility to enter the draft, completed 262 of 423 passes for 2,932 yards and 
22 touchdowns at Illinois last season. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Leigh Steinberg, who also negotiated Aikman's contract, and Colt General 
Manager Jim Irsay bargained until 5:30 a.m. Friday at an all-night restaurant, 
Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was the only obstacle to a trade by which the Colts sent Pro Bowl 
tackle Chris Hinton, wide receiver Andre Rison and two draft choices to Atlanta 
for the first pick in Sunday's draft. The Colts, who also received the Falcons' 
fourth-round pick this year, had imposed a Friday deadline on signing George, 
or the deal would have been off.

An appeals panel upheld the suspension of steeplechaser Henry Marsh for failing 
to appear for a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics Congress announced April 3 that it would ban the four-time 
Olympian for a two-year period for failing to report in December for year-round 
drug testing. The appeals panel concluded Friday that Marsh had not made 
himself available for testing within 48 hours of receiving notice, as required.

Heavyweight champion Buster Douglas has filed for divorce, his wife's attorney 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Stith, attorney for Bertha Douglas, said Douglas alleges gross neglect of 
duty and incompatibility. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Douglas nor his manager, John Johnson, could be reached for comment. 
Johnson's son and executive assistant, John Johnson II, said the Douglas camp 
would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Stith said Douglas filed for divorce Wednesday. She said Bertha Douglas will 
contest it. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Douglas and I have not yet figured out what our strategy will be," Stith 
said. "But we're going to protect her interests, that's for sure. My client 
doesn't want a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
Stith said Bertha Douglas did not expect the filing. 
</P>
<P>
The Douglases have been married since 1986. They separated in September, but 
Stith said they have been back together "for a few months." She said she did 
not know exactly how long. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas won the heavyweight title in February by knocking out Mike Tyson.

NUNN APPEARS EAGER TO CUT OLD LOYALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In happier days, they fought and cheered together. Then Michael Nunn became a 
champion. His stablemate Gabe Ruelas seemed to be on his way. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for reasons no one seems to understand fully, Nunn has chosen to break off 
old friendships and loyalties. The middleweight champion appeared to have 
partially patched up his feud with the Goossen brothers, Dan and Joe, when he 
asked his former trainer, Joe Goossen, to work his corner during his victory 
over Marlon Starling on Saturday at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
But after the fight, Nunn had little to say about prospects for a 
reconciliation with the people who helped make him a millionaire. Actually, he 
seemed to go out of his way to say nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I just want to take some time off, kick back and relax, and see 
what happens," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The Goossens know what's happening. Nunn is in his hometown of Davenport, Iowa, 
never good news for them. There, as the Goossens see it, a group continues to 
try to separate him from them. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere they look, they see signs that Nunn wants out. Nunn's contract with 
Ten Goose expires in November. Apparently, he can't bring himself to look them 
in the eye and spell it out, so Nunn has decided that mean-spirited gestures 
will work. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing he has said or done in recent months delivered a louder message than 
his behavior Saturday after he'd beaten Starling. This one rang even louder 
than the afternoon in training camp not long ago when Nunn's cousin called Dan 
Goossen "a thief and a liar," while Nunn sat on his hands, remaining silent. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas, who in the past has demonstrated loyalty to and admiration for Nunn by 
carrying his spit bucket for him in his corner, went down on the Nunn-Starling 
undercard with a career-threatening injury. 
</P>
<P>
In his most important fight to date, Ruelas was handily beating veteran Jeff 
Franklin in a 10-round bout. Then he broke his right arm just above the elbow 
in the seventh round and lost for the first time in 22 fights. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas was taken to the hospital and underwent surgery that night. Two screws 
were needed to hold the bone together. 
</P>
<P>
The disappointed Ruelas, 19, who might not be able to put on gloves for six 
months, had lots of visitors and get-well wishes afterward. Guess who Ruelas 
never saw or heard from? 
</P>
<P>
Right, Michael Nunn, the middleweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Surkein, 71, Nunn's father figure/adviser since the fighter was 14, and who 
later steered him toward the Goossens, was reflecting on Nunn's recent 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I almost lost my wife," Surkein said. "She was like a mother to 
Mike and became very sick. We never heard from him -- not even a card. There's 
a certain meanness that's come over Mike in the last year or so and I don't 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Surkein caught himself and said: "Better make that 'forgetfulness,' not 
'meanness.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he wasn't going to talk about the Goossens last week. Then, the day 
before the fight, he took a long look at Cassius Green, whom he'd hired after 
he walked out on the Goossens in March, and decided he'd better have Joe 
Goossen in his corner after all. 
</P>
<P>
At one point last week, Nunn took a knock at the Southern California lifestyle, 
implying that he preferred Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"All that matters out there (in Southern California) is how many Mercedes you 
have in your driveway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn has three Mercedes. One was a gift from his former promoter, Bob Arum. He 
bought the others. He was also given a Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: The Goossens have about had it with Nunn. Any more, and it will be 
the Goossens who walk, not Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
The arm injury sustained by Ruelas on the Nunn-Starling undercard couldn't have 
happened at a more inopportune time for him. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas, who looks like a teen-age Roberto Duran, not only saw his unbeaten 
streak come to a sudden end, but his immediate future went on hold, too. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas couldn't lift his right arm fully after injuring it in the fifth round, 
but he was still winning the fight in the seventh. Then, in a clinch, Franklin 
twisted Ruelas' injured arm, and the arm bent about 90 degrees at the elbow -- 
the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas cried out in pain, crumpled to the canvas and the fight was stopped. 
Ruelas' trainer, Joe Goossen, wanted referee Richard Steele to disqualify 
Franklin, but it went into the books as a TKO loss for Ruelas. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Goossen, Ruelas' manager, said the timing of the injury was bad. "We had 
tentatively lined up two TV dates for him, for June and August, against rated 
junior-lightweights," Dan Goossen said. "We're told the recovery period, with 
rehab, is three to six months." 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Paid attendance for the Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor bout at the Las 
Vegas Hilton was 7,894, and the gate was $2,407,103, official records show. . . 
. When Virgil Hill, the World Boxing Assn. light-heavyweight champion, broke 
his thumb in training, his scheduled April 29 fight at Caesars Palace against 
Guy Waters was postponed until July, in Bismarck, N.D., and the co-main event, 
matching middleweights Doug DeWitt and and Nigel Benn, was switched to Caesars 
World in Atlantic City, N.J., on the same date. 
</P>
<P>
Welterweight Ernie Chavez (9-0) will step up to "name" opponents if he gets by 
veteran Juan Villa (33-10) at the Irvine Marriott Monday night, according to 
Chavez's trainer, Jackie McCoy. . . . Hard-core boxing buffs will have a big 
treat in Atlantic City later this month: April 26 -- Harold Brazier-Micky Ward, 
Resorts International; April 27 -- Jesus Rojas-Luigi Camputaro, Trump Castle; 
April 28 -- Thomas Hearns-Michael Olajide, Taj Mahal; April 29 -- DeWitt-Benn, 
Caesars World. Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic 
Committee, assured Anwar Chowdry, president of the International Amateur Boxing 
Assn., in Havana recently that boxing had a "permanent place" on the Olympic 
Games schedule. At Seoul in 1988, Samaranch threatened to have boxing dropped 
from the Olympics if a way wasn't found to prevent poor judging and mismatches 
at future Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gonzales, the one-time East Los Angeles street kid who predicted years in 
advance that he would win a gold medal in the Olympic Games and then did it, 
will get his long-awaited world title fight on June 10. Gonzales meets Orlando 
Canizales, the International Boxing Federation bantamweight champion, at El 
Paso in a bout to be televised by NBC. Gonzales has one decision over 
Canizales, in 1985 when both were flyweights.

PICK SIX WINNER COLLECTS $231,875 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One fan collected $231,875.40 with the only ticket with all six winners Friday 
in the Pick Six at Santa Anita, and as a result he may be enjoying retirement 
in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old building maintenance man who declined to reveal his name, 
employed by an insurance company, selected the winning half-dozen horses by 
name and jockeys, and after purchasing two separate $2 Pick Six tickets he had 
just 50 cents of the money he brought to the track left in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
'I might give one week's notice at my job,' said the man. 'This is better than 
the $64 I make working for a day.'

1 KILLED, 4 INJURED IN HOLLYWOOD STREET FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police followed a trail of blood late Friday in the Hollywood area searching 
for suspects in a "good old street fight" in which one man was killed and at 
least four others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the men were shot, one was stabbed and a fifth man -- possibly a 
suspect -- was also wounded. Police believe a fifth man was involved because 
they saw a trail of blood leading away from the scene. Police followed the 
trail but were unable to find him. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the incident began about 9:45 p.m. with a fight inside the La 
Iguerita bar, a pool hall and sports bar in the 6300 block of Yucca Street. The 
fight apparently spilled out into the street. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what led to the fight, but by the time police had 
arrived, bodies were strewn along a block-long stretch. None of the men, all 
Latino, was immediately identified. Two were said to be in their 30s and two in 
their mid-20s. The age of the fifth man was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD Officer Roy Rogers said that when he arrived at the scene, he found one 
man lying on the sidewalk outside of the bar. That man had been shot at least 
once. 
</P>
<P>
The fight apparently continued west on Yucca, to the corner of Yucca and 
Cahuenga Boulevard, where a second man was found. Police found one more victim 
near a 7-Eleven store and the fourth outside the Hollywood 8 Motel in the 1800 
block of Cahuenga. 
</P>
<P>
As police moved in with helicopters and dogs, two suspects were at one point 
said to be holed up in a nearby hotel shortly before 11 p.m. Friday. That 
report proved to be false. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the man who dripped a trail of blood, police were looking for at 
least three other men involved in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD Lt. Pete Durham said two of the wounded were critically injured. Two were 
taken to Cedars Sinai Hospital, where one died, according to a hospital 
spokeswoman. One man was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank and one to 
Kaiser Foundation Hospital on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Their conditions 
were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not immediately know the motive for the incident, which 
one officer described as a "good old street fight." One witness called it a 
drug deal gone bad. Police said several narcotics arrests have been made at the 
bar in the past. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time as the Hollywood shooting, police were called to the scene 
of a homicide at La Tijera Boulevard and Centinela Avenue in Westchester, where 
one person had been shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the death appeared to be gang-related but could not say whether it 
had been a drive-by shooting.

WIDE-OPEN SKIES LURED CARLSBAD WOMAN TO FAME, DARING IN '20S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Custom dictates that 84-year-old women don't charge around town in bright red 
Porsches. 
</P>
<P>
But a sports car is actually in a slow league for Bobbi Trout, a world-famous 
1920s aviator and friend of Amelia Earhart who today lives quietly, except for 
the modest revving of her car engine, in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Trout always hated the notion of a life of dirty dishes and housework and 
instead chose emergency landings in fields, grueling endurance flights and the 
glory of an earlier time. 
</P>
<P>
She was a pioneer of aviation's Golden Age, and today, left with her memories, 
she's videotaping interviews with other flight pioneers. But most of the women 
she knew and competed against are dead now, leaving her among the few who 
remember how it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I was flying when it was wide open, you were as free as a bird," said Trout, 
who knew of much of the Los Angeles area when it was a vast quilt of fields and 
farms, where people stopped what they were doing and waved when a plane 
gracefully interrupted the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Of modern aviation, she said, "There are too many in it, you're a number. We 
used to be a person. There are too many rules and regulations that take the joy 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
For Trout, making her own rules and regulations has won her a place in history. 
</P>
<P>
She held the women's pilot endurance record of 12 hours, 11 minutes in 1929, 
promptly lost it, and won it back. She was awarded the coveted Aviation Gold 
Cross from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the world honorary 
flying organization that issued Trout a license signed by Orville Wright. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Diego Aerospace Museum, Trout's name is engraved in the Women's Hall 
of Fame, alongside the names of "women widely known around the world," said 
archivist Ray Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
"She was an example of a spirit of adventure and courage some young women 
showed in advancing the popularity of aviation," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
When Dr. Peggy Baty, associate dean of academics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical 
University campus in Prescott, Ariz., where Trout was recently honored, thinks 
about the most courageous early women fliers, she said: "In the '20s and '30s, 
I see four names: Amelia Earhart, Louise Thaden, Bobbi Trout and (Florence) 
Pancho Barnes." 
</P>
<P>
Earhart vanished into mysterious immortality in 1937, and Barnes and Thaden 
died in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Trout sits in her condominium amid flight memorabilia and summons to mind a 
snowy day in 1918 when she trudged home from school in Ontario, where she was 
then living with her family. A biplane droned overhead. "Oh my god, it thrilled 
me to death, I knew someday I'd learn to fly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That year, she moved back to the Midwest, where she contracted influenza during 
a nationwide epidemic that killed thousands. After months of recuperating, her 
lungs remained scarred, and the Trouts boarded the train for the better climate 
of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, Trout finally paid $250 to learn to fly, which in retrospect 
seems rather expensive for a near-death experience. She and her instructor, 
Dale Page, were aloft in a two-seat, open-cockpit OX5 Jenny when he cut the 
throttle, failed to lower the nose and the plane spun 100 feet into a field. 
</P>
<P>
Trout suffered a concussion and cuts, and her mother urged her to forsake 
airplanes. "Why?" Trout responded with typical aviator logic. "If I'd been 
killed, I wouldn't have known about it." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Trout was world-famous. 
</P>
<P>
She zoomed up in the predawn darkness of Jan. 2, 1929, over Van Nuys Airport in 
a Golden Eagle monoplane, hoping to break the women's pilot endurance record of 
eight hours. She circled endlessly around the airport for 12 hours and 11 
minutes before making her first night landing and encountering a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to see photographers and a crowd around me. I just knew I was 
running out of gas and should set down," Trout said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost instantly, Trout became a worldwide sensation, although there are some 
less-enthusiastic recollections of her feat. 
</P>
<P>
In his memoir of early American aviation, pioneer flier Waldo Dean Waterman 
writes that Trout's marathon flight infuriated then-Maj. Carl Spaatz, who years 
later commanded the 8th Air Force in Britain and became the first Air Force 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Spaatz was trying to establish an endurance test flight for aerial refueling 
and engine operation for the U.S. Army Air Service when his tri-motor craft 
approached the field where Trout was circling. 
</P>
<P>
Waterman, who was at the field, noted that, when Spaatz "discovered there was 
another plane flying around in his air space, he really raised hell, sending me 
a message to 'get that damn plane out of there right now!' " 
</P>
<P>
"My reply was, 'What do you want me to do, shoot her down?' " Waterman said. 
</P>
<P>
When Trout recently learned about this footnote to flight history, she replied, 
"I received a nice little letter (of congratulations) from Spaatz." Then she 
added with slight annoyance, "Evidently it didn't bother him too much." 
</P>
<P>
However, Trout's triumph was short-lived as another woman pilot, Elinor Smith, 
posted a 13-hour flight only a few days later. So, Trout attempted to break the 
record again, and, on Feb. 9, 1929, she soared above Mines Field in Inglewood 
in her 60-horsepower Golden Eagle and stayed up 17 hours and 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Bored amid the blackness of night and the monotonous engine drone, Trout said, 
"I went to sleep a few times, and when I went into a dive, the engine awakened 
me." She rubbed her neck and sang to pass the hours. 
</P>
<P>
When she landed, she had shattered records for endurance, mileage and takeoff 
weight. "That was the first time a woman had stayed up all night in the air," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The flight built her reputation as she grabbed new headlines, such as "Sky Girl 
Sets Mark," an account in a Los Angeles newspaper that described the 
22-year-old aviator as a "tomboy who took up flying to avoid dishwashing. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
There was considerable truth in that characterization. Trout has always said 
that dolls, marriage and the traditional life of a woman of her era never 
interested her. "Mother wanted me to be a lady, and she didn't get one, that's 
all," said Trout. 
</P>
<P>
But mother, Lola Trout, touted her suddenly prominent daughter to newspaper 
reporters as a "wonderful baby." 
</P>
<P>
Although her actual first name is Evelyn, she was called Bobbi because she 
bobbed her hair in 1924. She preferred pants over dresses, used to shoot 
rattlesnakes in the backcountry and enjoyed helping run her family's gas 
station in Los Angeles. She never married. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that almost everybody knew her from her photographs, in which she 
wore English riding boots, a leather flight jacket, cap and goggles. "I'd go 
down the street, and I'd hear people say, 'There goes Bobbi Trout,' " she 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
She even consented to commercial endorsements for Nash cars and Richfield 
gasoline and motor oil. 
</P>
<P>
Those were days of heroes, heroines and legends, and Trout met them all. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering Charles Lindbergh, she said he "was rather quiet and distant. He 
had a weak handshake. That was one thing everybody talked about." 
</P>
<P>
She was a friend of Amelia Earhart, who became the most famous American aviator 
after she crossed the Atlantic alone. Despite the rivalries among women fliers, 
Trout said they were cordial and supportive of one another. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a lovely girl, I liked Amelia very much," Trout said. "She was always 
sweet and charming." 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1937, Earhart, 38, and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared during 
an around-the-world flight as they headed toward a Pacific island. Some have 
speculated that she was on a pre-World War II military intelligence-gathering 
mission and was captured by the Japanese, but Trout called that "just 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Trout firmly believes Earhart, who "hated trailing antennae," had the appendage 
removed from her craft. She was probably near the island but couldn't find it 
or maintain radio communication. Trout thinks Earhart made a fatal mistake by 
not taking along a navigator who could also operate the radio. "She messed up 
when she didn't take a radio operator with her." 
</P>
<P>
When Earhart was lost, "We were all just sick," she said. After all these 
years, Trout's voice still drops when she talks about it. 
</P>
<P>
In the '30s, Trout went on to other famous exploits, including a 122-hour 
endurance flight with Edna May Cooper, and a fair share of emergency landings. 
She also tried to get hired as an airline pilot, but was spurned. They thought 
that, if a woman was flying the plane, "they wouldn't get any passengers," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Trout owned a small defense contracting company, quit 
flying in 1946 and spent the years until retirement in real estate and other 
ventures. She moved to Carlsbad 14 years ago and wrote a biography, "Just Plane 
Crazy."

Mayor Tom Bradley's proposed 1990-91 budget for the city of Los Angeles calls 
for several large expenditures in the San Fernando Valley, including $33.5 
million for expansion of the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation plant and 
$14.5 million for continuation of the North Hollywood Redevelopment Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the major Valley proposals are $3.7 million for improvement of three 
Valley police stations, $2.2 million for construction of a senior citizens 
center in Pacoima and about $14.9 million in additional costs related to 
changes at Lopez Canyon Landfill, the city-operated dump above Lake View 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
The budget will be reviewed and debated by the City Council in hearings 
scheduled to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillman sewage treatment plant, in Van Nuys, is being enlarged to reduce 
the volume of sewage treated at the Hyperion Treatment Plant in Playa del Rey, 
thus decreasing the chance for ocean-bound sewage spills. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is calling for completion by late 1991 of a dechlorination facility at 
the Tillman plant, air pollution control equipment and a system for sending 
treated water to Sepulveda Basin lakes. An additional 17 sanitation workers and 
11 city engineers are included in the mayor's budget to carry out these 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The 740-acre North Hollywood redevelopment district was created in 1979. The 
project has been criticized by some local activists for favoring further 
improvements of an upscale business and office development over rehabilitation 
of houses. The mayor's budget calls for spending $14.5 million on the project 
this year, up from $12.2 million in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
The largest proposed expenditure at Lopez Canyon Landfill is intended to 
fulfill a city agreement to limit the number of garbage trucks entering the 
dump to 400 trucks daily. That agreement evolved from a state crackdown on dump 
operations last year. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's budget calls for spending $7 million to transport the spillover 
household trash, park trimmings and street sweeping debris to private 
landfills. The budget also calls for spending $1.25 million to buy land around 
the landfill that would form a partial buffer between the dump and residential 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacoima senior citizens center, which may be named for northeast Valley City 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, has been discussed for several years. The council 
on Friday agreed to schedule public hearings to discuss buying land at 11266 
Glenoaks Blvd. for the center. 
</P>
<P>
Three Valley police stations have outgrown their facilities, according to 
statements in the mayor's budget, and need $24.9 million to expand buildings 
and add parking. 
</P>
<P>
For the coming year, the mayor has proposed spending $3.7 million on the 
stations, with the largest portion -- $2.9 million -- going to the North 
Hollywood station for land purchase and building designs. 
</P>
<P>
Two other stations, Foothill in Pacoima and West Valley in Reseda, would 
receive $471,000 and $333,000, respectively, for architectural designs and 
construction plans. 
</P>
<P>
Other major Valley expenditures include: 
</P>
<P>
* $23.3 million for Valley water and power projects, including construction of 
a water well system in Tujunga, increased capacity of the North Hollywood water 
sewer system and expansion of an electrical power conversion plant in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
* $3.35 million for work at the Van Nuys Airport, including a $2.4-million 
taxiway. 
</P>
<P>
* About $2.4 million for improving library service to the Valley, including $1 
million for expanding the Panorama City Branch Library. 
</P>
<P>
* More than $2 million for improvement of various transit and transportation 
services and studies ranging from a study of the impact of future growth on 
Sunland/Tujunga traffic to an increase in dial-a-ride service from Sunland to 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly $2 million for resurfacing and adding lights to city-owned parking 
lots in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
* $850,000 for renovation of the municipal building in Van Nuys, including 
removal of asbestos and installation of fire sprinklers and disabled access.

GALLEGLY'S CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST INDICATES BIG EDGE OVER KORMAN; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: FILINGS SHOW INCUMBENTS IN OTHER VALLEY RACES ALSO HAVE EARLY 
FUND-RAISING ADVANTAGES OVER CHALLENGERS.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) has stockpiled $267,555 in campaign funds, 
giving him an apparent advantage over his Republican challenger in the June 5 
primary, campaign reports released this week show. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Calabasas real-estate developer Sang Korman, reported that he had 
only $4,621 on hand as of April 1. Korman had raised $51,248 since Jan. 1 but 
spent $76,242, much of it for mailings, advertisements and consulting. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Korman loaned his campaign $243,710 of his own money. He has yet to 
contribute to his current bid but said he plans to contribute an unspecified 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
In other San Fernando Valley area contests, incumbents also have early 
fund-raising advantages over primary and general election challengers, 
according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. The documents 
cover fund raising and campaign spending for the first three months of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The reports underscore the extent to which incumbents -- already far better 
known, bolstered by staff and publicly financed mailings and often representing 
districts drawn to favor their political parties -- are better armed 
financially to communicate with voters in their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, whose 21st District includes southern Ventura County and parts of the 
western and northern Valley, reported raising $132,529 since Jan. 1 and 
spending $41,288. He raised $188,653 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The former Simi Valley mayor received 86% of his contributions from 
individuals, an unusually high percentage, and 14% from political action 
committees. This included $3,098 from the Farmers Insurance PAC and $1,300 from 
the Great Western PAC. 
</P>
<P>
Korman, meanwhile, received no PAC contributions. Campaign Manager Bob Lavoie 
said Korman, who spent $391,000 in his unsuccessful 1988 race against Gallegly, 
will have enough money to wage an active campaign. Korman expects to spend a 
smaller sum this time, Lavoie said, but he would not specify an amount. Most of 
Korman's contributions came from fellow Korean-Americans outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has $307,341 on hand. 
No report was available for his Democratic primary opponent, Scott Gaulke. 
Reports were required to be postmarked by April 15; candidates who have raised 
less than $5,000 do not have to file. 
</P>
<P>
Berman raised $22,510, including $10,900 from PACs, and spent $23,398. His 
largest contributors were the American Trial Lawyers Assn. PAC, which gave him 
$5,000, and the Transamerica Life Co. PAC, which contributed $2,500. Berman, an 
attorney, sits on the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Forsch, who is seeking the GOP nomination in Berman's 26th District, 
reported raising $3,158 from individual givers. No report was available for Roy 
Dahlson, who is opposing Forsch in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) raised only $2,015 during the first 
three months of the year. Beilenson, who does not accept PAC contributions, 
reported $79,974 on hand. 
</P>
<P>
His likely GOP opponent, Jim Salomon (R-Beverly Hills), reported garnering 
$43,137. All but $3,000 of his contributions were from individuals. The ARCO 
PAC gave him $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon also spent $70,711 during this period, much of it on fund raising, 
computer and consulting fees. He reported $56,019 on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) raised only $2,100 during the reporting 
period but remains one of the best-financed House members. He has $702,952 in 
his campaign fund. No report was available for his likely Democratic opponent, 
Tom Vournas. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) reported taking in $42,850, including 
$38,850 from PACs. Waxman, who chairs the health and environment subcommittee 
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, received $5,000 from the Pacific 
Telesis Pac; $3,000 from BellSouth Pac; $2,500 each from the Gulf &amp; Western 
Inc. PAC, the National Education Assn. PAC and the Human Rights Fund. He also 
received additional contributions from various health-related PACs. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, who contributes generously to liberal Democratic candidates nationwide, 
has $489,695 on hand. No report was available for his probable Republican 
opponent, John N. Cowles. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), whose 35th District includes part of the 
Antelope Valley, has $130,697 available. He has no primary or general election 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Rep. William Thomas (R-Bakersfield) nor his GOP opponent, Rod Gregory, 
had campaign reports on file last week. Thomas' 20th District includes the 
northern Antelope Valley.

AROUND THE VALLEY: PAST IS PRESENT FOR AGING POWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The old men gathered one night in a meeting room at the Disabled American 
Veterans Hall in Woodland Hills and, one after another, introduced themselves 
by announcing when they became prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Romero," said the first to rise. "Captured in Anzio." 
</P>
<P>
"Del Brown, Dec. 22, 1941," said another. "I was captured two weeks after the 
war started. I spent most of the war in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
"Willie Goldsmith, captured Dec. 22, 1944, in The Bulge." 
</P>
<P>
On they went, carrying out a regular ritual at the monthly meeting of the San 
Fernando Valley Chapter of American Ex-Prisoners of War, a nationwide group of 
veterans, mostly from World War II, who spent part of their youths in the 
shadow of guard towers or behind the sharp steel of concertina wire. 
</P>
<P>
In their youth, they battled Nazis and the Japanese. Now they battle American 
bureaucracy, fighting to preserve or improve their medical benefits. The 15 
ex-POWs and their wives spent much of the evening discussing the Veterans 
Administration and service at VA hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
But the men also battle, in their minds, demons who followed them home from 
Omaha Beach and Palermo, Corregidor and Bataan. 
</P>
<P>
The distance of four decades has not made it any easier to deal with the war. 
Many times, they said, the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has a tendency to get worse as you get older," Brown, a slight man 
with sad eyes, told a visitor. "When you keep something covered up for 40 
years, when it starts coming out, it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Brown was 21 when he was captured at Wake Island. He wasn't even supposed to 
fight. He was a civilian construction worker, helping build an air base. But 
the civilians had to join the 300 Marines at the front lines when the Japanese 
attacked the day after Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"We only had 1,500 people there," he said almost apologetically. "We fought 
them off two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
At his home in Van Nuys, tucked in a box in the garage, are small mementoes of 
his days in a Japanese prison camp: A pair of chopsticks, a homemade wooden 
pipe and a pouch of 45-year-old tobacco, a prized luxury back then. They ate 
mostly rice for four years, he recalled. He weighed 95 pounds when he was 
liberated. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Brown goes to therapy sessions with other POWs. Sometimes, the men 
are in tears. "When you see people killed for no reason at all," he said, "it 
just doesn't leave you." 
</P>
<P>
There were no tears at their recent meeting. After a brief welcome by 
Commandant George Bergez they called roll, sounding off the names of the 
ex-POWs and their wives. The wives, Bergez explained, are full members of the 
organization. "We figured they suffered as much as we did with our little 
antics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The men and women answered to their names, except for John Yosko, who busied 
himself organizing the night's raffle. 
</P>
<P>
"John?" 
</P>
<P>
No answer. 
</P>
<P>
"John?" 
</P>
<P>
"He can't hear," someone said. 
</P>
<P>
They agreed to count Yosko as present and accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Bergez moved through an agenda of routine business, asking now and then for a 
committee report. The chapter has $811.66 in its bank account, the treasurer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the treasury has just received a donation of $100, said Bergez's wife, 
Barbara. She read the card accompanying the donation from a woman whose husband 
once served as commandant: "Thank you for your love and prayers during Al's 
illness and death." The members nodded slightly to acknowledge the gift. 
</P>
<P>
Whether discussing medical benefits or the Veterans Administration, the men 
seemed defensive, suggesting again and again that the government didn't care 
about POWs. In the world of veterans, the men insisted, World War II POWs are 
outcasts, unlike the honored former prisoners from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The attitude goes back to the days right after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Dale 
Stephens, whose plane was shot down over Germany, explained by recalling a 
conversation with a pretty young woman he met in college after the war. He 
mentioned his time in the service. 
</P>
<P>
"You were a POW?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you surrender?" 
</P>
<P>
Forty years later, the words still sting. "Her attitude was we really should 
have fought to the death," he said. For many years, he never mentioned his time 
in the prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
The men and women in the San Fernando Valley Chapter of American Ex-Prisoners 
of War say they are still fighting for self-respect. They eagerly talk to a 
stranger about the war and pull out mementoes and news clippings. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Landers of Mission Hills still has his dog tags and ID photo from Stalag 
17B, the German prison camp which held 4,300 Americans, most of them "flyboys" 
shot down in bomber raids. Landers was shot down over Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
With his white hair, chubby face and cheery smile, he bears little resemblance 
to the serious young man in the photo holding up a chalkboard with his prison 
identification number. It's hard to believe it's the same man. 
</P>
<P>
But then he recounts the day his B-24 was shot out of the sky and how his boots 
somehow flew off his feet as he parachuted toward a freshly plowed field. His 
legs were so badly injured the Germans left him behind when they evacuated 
Stalag 17B as the Russians approached. 
</P>
<P>
The details pour out, vivid and fresh. Clearly, for Landers and many others, 
the young men they were will always be behind the wire.

OHIO MAN CHARGED WITH FAKING HIS OWN DEATH IN $1-MILLION INSURANCE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Ohio man appeared for arraignment in Los Angeles Friday on charges of faking 
his own death and conspiring with a business partner and a Glendale neurologist 
to kill a man to provide a body so they could collect $1 million worth of 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Hanson, 48, was flown Thursday night from Columbus, Ohio, to appear in 
Los Angeles Municipal Court, but his arraignment was continued to April 27 
after a public defender requested that Hanson be examined by a doctor for 
fatigue and physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, John Hawkins of Ohio and Dr. Richard Boggs of Glendale were charged 
with murder, conspiracy to commit murder for financial gain, grand theft and 
insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege the three conspired to kill Ellis Greene, 32, of North 
Hollywood, whose body was found in Boggs' office in April, 1988. Boggs, 56, 
allegedly identified the body as Hanson's to defraud his insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Pretrial motions for Boggs are scheduled to be heard Monday. Jury selection is 
set for May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, 27, Hanson's business partner and sole heir, collected $1 million in 
life insurance after Hanson was reported dead, authorities contend. Despite an 
international manhunt, Hawkins remains at large, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert H. MacKenzie would not comment on how the extradition 
of Hanson, who has been in custody in Ohio for more than a year, will affect 
Boggs' trial or whether it may help authorities find Hawkins. He said there is 
little chance that Hanson and Boggs can be tried together. 
</P>
<P>
But other authorities involved in the case said Hanson's appearance is a key 
step in solving the alleged murder-for-insurance scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"Things could change -- it could be a whole new ball game," said Jerry 
Treadway, a fraud investigator for the state Department of Insurance. "You've 
got 'mister dead man' here now." 
</P>
<P>
Hanson was arrested in January, 1989, and charged by Ohio prosecutors with 
criminal grand theft. But the charges were dropped after more extensive charges 
-- including murder -- were filed in Los Angeles, and California prosecutors 
requested Hanson's extradition. The Ohio Supreme Court on Thursday refused to 
review an appellate court decision to extradite him that was reached earlier 
that day.

ON CAMPUS: PIERCE COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET SQUEEZE DELAYS OPENING OF COMPUTER LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The opening of a centralized computer lab at Pierce College, originally set for 
this spring, has been put off until fall of 1991 because of college budget 
difficulties, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The lab, which in its early stages will cost about $110,000 annually, is to be 
used by students taking a wide range of computer and non-computer classes, said 
Kathy Yoder, who chairs the Computer Lab Committee at the Woodland Hills 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Yoder said a recent survey of academic departments at Pierce found that 
representatives of nearly all of them said that they would like to see the 
computer lab installed and that at least 10 departments would be able to 
immediately use the computers. 
</P>
<P>
The delay puts the campus, the only school in the Los Angeles Community College 
District without a central computer facility that can be used by any student on 
campus, even further behind. 
</P>
<P>
"We are way behind the times compared to most community colleges," said Peter 
Schleppenbach, a computer science professor who is a computer committee member. 
Other "colleges are talking about sharing software nationwide and we don't even 
have any networking yet." 
</P>
<P>
"Academic computing has brought us into the age where we can throw away the 
chalkboard," Schleppenbach said. "An art history student, for example, could 
use a videodisc to call up half a million pictures. Instructors will be able to 
spend more time orchestrating their classes, rather than doing tedium stuff 
such as correcting homework." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce now has computers available for students taking computer-related classes 
but not for other students. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Norlund, vice president of administration, said Pierce's 1989-90 budget of 
$27 million could be in the red by as much as $200,000 by the end of the year.

ON CAMPUS: COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS; 
</P>
<P>
LEASING OF PARKING LOTS TO SWAP MEET FIRM IS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from reports of campus correspondents and Times staff writers.

<TEXT>
<P>
The College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita has approved allowing a private 
company to use campus parking lots to conduct weekend swap meets in exchange 
for fees of more than $144,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Community College District Board of Trustees voted this week 
to allow the Santa Clarita Valley Swap Meet Inc. to rent the college's lower 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying a monthly fee of $12,000, the swap meet organizers would 
be responsible for setting up the meets and cleaning up afterward. College 
events that conflicted with the swap meets would take precedence. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason this is an attractive offer is because the parking lots are in 
desperate need of repair," College President-Supt. Dianne Van Hook said. "This 
would allow us to repair them and hire additional needed security." 
</P>
<P>
She said it would also make it possible to continue allowing students to park 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
A contract between Nazareth A. Chobanian and Sabu Chitjian, from the swap meet 
firm, and the COC Foundation, whose purpose is to raise money for the college, 
is to be signed after the college examines the firm's financial backing, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The swap meets could begin Memorial Day weekend.

ON CAMPUS: WOODBURY UNIVERSITY; 
</P>
<P>
NEW DORMS TO FINALLY BE COMPLETED

<P>
Four three-story stucco and brick dormitories that have been under construction 
since last summer are soon to become home to 128 Woodbury University students. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officials said the dorms, which are consistent with the Burbank school's 
traditional Spanish architecture, are to be completed by April 30. Students 
will begin moving in a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sold $1.75 million in bonds to pay for the dorms. The 
university, part of which is in county territory, will repay bond purchasers 
with interest over a 30-year period. 
</P>
<P>
University officials projected when construction began last summer that the 
project would be completed by Thanksgiving and that students would be able to 
move in soon after. But Jack Nelson, vice president of campus services, said 
the project ran into a variety of delays in getting necessary permits. 
</P>
<P>
The four buildings are connected by balconies and walkways. Each floor houses 
12 students with varying arrangements of four double rooms and four single 
rooms that are furnished with desks and beds. Students share a common living 
area and restroom on each floor. 
</P>
<P>
Although students will be required to move into the dorms during the middle of 
the spring quarter, which ends June 15, Nelson stressed that the school would 
"make the move as easy and worry-free as possible for the students." 
</P>
<P>
Moving trucks and vans will be provided for students who were assigned to 
corporate apartments in Burbank while the dorms were being built. 
</P>
<P>
Mary McGhee, housing director, said students began applying to live in the 
on-campus dormitories in March, 1989, and all rooms have been filled. Students 
living in the dorms will pay between $900 and $990 per quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The new dorms, along with the old 56-room dorm, will allow about one-third of 
Woodbury's traditional college-age students to live on campus. Woodbury's 
enrollment is 850. 
</P>
<P>
"We discovered that several students who would have applied to Woodbury didn't 
because of lack of housing," McGhee said. "Students are much more willing to 
stick around and do things on campus when they live in the dorms. We expect the 
student organizations to grow because more students will be here to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
The university also plans to build additional dormitories in the future, 
college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The dorms are in the shape of a half-circle," she said. "When the money is 
available, similar dorms will be built to complete the circle and create a 
park-like atmosphere."

ON CAMPUS: ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
SATURDAY CURRICULUM COULD LEAD TO DEGREE

One of the fastest-growing community colleges in California is hoping that a 
new program will allow it to grow even faster. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Community College in Lancaster, beginning this summer, will 
allow students to earn associate's degrees while taking classes only on 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment at Antelope Valley Community College is 9,980 and growing by between 
5% and 6% annually. The area's population is growing at nearly twice that rate, 
and college officials would like to see more of them enroll as students. 
</P>
<P>
Students enrolling this summer could graduate by the fall of 1993 with an 
associate's degree in letters, arts and sciences. The degree would satisfy the 
requirements for the first two years of a liberal studies major at Cal State 
Northridge, the major transfer school for Antelope Valley College students. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said the Saturday program is uniquely appropriate for the 
Lancaster school's students, many of whom attend classes part time while 
commuting to jobs in Los Angeles. Officials said the degree program is aimed at 
attracting students who are otherwise unlikely to attend college classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel these are people that work in L.A. and commute two to three hours a 
day," said Rae Yoshida, vice president of academic affairs for the college. 
"They are obviously people that are employed and . . . interested in improving 
their educational experience. So I think the college would be really remiss if 
we didn't at least provide an . . . opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
If the Saturday-degree program proves popular, administrators said, a second 
program that prepares students for entrance to the business administration 
major at CSUN will be considered. 
</P>
<P>
College President Allan Kurki said the Saturday degree studies will make the 
college more accessible for students. "I applaud increased flexibility," he 
said. "There is no one thing that's best. You have to do as many things as you 
can across the spectrum" to attract and educate students.

CHEAP GAS OFFER FOR CAR-POOLERS GETS FEW TAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything was calm at the Shell gas station on East Harbor Boulevard in 
Ventura Friday morning, almost too calm . . . until the Advantage Wonder 
Cleaner salespeople arrived. 
</P>
<P>
It was just after 10 a.m. when they pulled up. It had been four hours since the 
start of radio station KXBS' Earth Day car-pool promotion, in which any vehicle 
with four or more people on board that drove up to a full-service pump would 
get gas at a discounted 99 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was that there were no car-poolers early in the morning. Then 
came the KXBS "bus," fully engaged in blasting music and trying to attract 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
And then the Wonder Cleaner folks drove up. 
</P>
<P>
There were about seven of them, piled into their spacious blue van, toting 
their $25.95 per quart miracle cleaner with the slogan, "You Furnish the Water, 
We'll Furnish the Cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
"Car-pooling is great," said Ernest Scott, supervisor for Austin Diversified 
Products, the Illinois-based parent company of the Wonder Cleaner. "It's a 
great way to meet new friends. And less cars means less pollution and less 
accidents. Am I right? And it means less highway shootings." 
</P>
<P>
Scott's was actually the second Wonder Cleaner van to stop by in the space of 
about half an hour. The local office is around the corner from the gas station, 
so salespeople are regular customers. The driver of the first van, however, was 
unaware of the promotion and used a self-serve pump. 
</P>
<P>
But for most of the morning, the focus of station employees was on setting up a 
display for this weekend's oil and filter special, which offers a $10 discount. 
In fact, a 10-foot-tall Truck Guard Motor Oil container was inflated and placed 
at the front of the station after the KXBS bus drove off. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of goes along with Earth Day. We want people to change their oil here 
and not dump the stuff in their own yard," said Tom Atlas, the gas station's 
manager. "The homeowner is the biggest polluter." 
</P>
<P>
Atlas was somewhat frustrated at the low car-pooler turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"California isn't conducive to it. People need to have their cars," he said. "I 
don't have the answers. It may take another oil shortage. There was so much 
said about the last shortage being contrived. No one knew what really happened. 
The last shortage created smaller cars, maybe the next shortage will lead to 
car pools." 
</P>
<P>
But even some of the non-car-poolers who stopped at the station had opinions on 
how to improve the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I should go around the corner and pick up a few hitchhikers," said John Ching, 
the driver of a psychedelically painted Chevette. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything to do for Earth Day. I just complain about things. 
We've got to stop the population from increasing. Car-pooling, fluorocarbons 
are all great, but if the population increases, we'll just do what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes after the Wonder Cleaner people drove off, a red compact 
slowly made its way to the full-service unleaded tank. A mother and her two 
young children were in the compact. Three people. Not enough for the car-pool 
discount. But at this point things were looking kind of desperate, so an 
exception was made. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a business delivering neon, so I don't car-pool," Kathy Matzenger said. 
"But I think car-pooling is wonderful. I try to get my kids in car-pools 
whenever I can. William is in kindergarten, and nobody wanted him, but Leanne 
is in third grade and she's in a car-pool."

TEAMSTERS ELECT REFORM CANDIDATE TO LEAD LOCAL 186 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County Teamsters on Friday elected a self-styled reform candidate to 
head the local union, ousting its leader who was accused of following orders 
from an ex-convict running things from behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Shaw won 43% of the vote of Teamsters Local 186, edging out two other 
candidates, including the union's current leader Greg Boverson, who received 
35%. 
</P>
<P>
"The members have spoken," Shaw said. "They have made the change necessary to 
get the local on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
In the two-week election that ended Friday night, the union's 2,800 members 
voted in nearly every member of Shaw's slate of reform candidates to the board 
of trustees and other leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
Only one candidate associated with Boverson, Mark Weedon, won a seat on the 
Teamster board. 
</P>
<P>
In a classic Teamster power struggle, the election was marred by allegations of 
ballot tampering and by late-night gunshots that shattered the windows of one 
campaign headquarters. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
While the Shaw slate ran against Boverson, much of the campaign focused on 
Martin W. Fry, who led the local Teamsters until he was convicted of embezzling 
funds in connection with the firebombing of non-union trucks. 
</P>
<P>
After Fry's release from prison in 1987, Boverson hired Fry, his mentor, as a 
clerk. Under federal law, as an ex-convict, the only positions Fry can legally 
hold are janitor or clerk. The two worked closely over the past two years, and 
a majority of board members tried unsuccessfully to get rid of both of them. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the membership for help, a majority of the board, led by Shaw, ran a 
campaign to remove Boverson and Fry. The theme of the campaign was summed up by 
the headline of one campaign flyer: "Your Local Is Being Run By An Ex-Con." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we cleaned our own house," said Pat Mansfield, the outgoing president 
of the board who aligned himself with Shaw. "The people decided that Martin Fry 
was the man to get out and Greg was just a puppet for him, just as we said." 
</P>
<P>
Boverson, who had denied following Fry's orders, accepted defeat graciously 
Friday night. "The membership has spoken, and we will go on down the road," 
Boverson said. He congratulated his successor. "As long as he takes care of the 
membership, he will have my support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fry declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
While the election accomplished the goals of one slate of reform candidates, it 
was marred by allegations of election tampering from a separate reformist 
slate. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Gonzales, campaign manager for the separate slate, said that Shaw and 
Boverson had told him that the polls for the mail balloting would be left open 
until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He said his slate had a list of 100 Teamsters who had not received ballots and 
were mailed duplicate ones on Wednesday. These voting members needed the 
extension to receive their ballots and return them in time to be counted. At 
the same time, he said, Boverson and Shaw reneged on their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said the election board had considered the extension but decided to stick 
with its original election date marked on the ballots. He also said the 
election board has no confirmation that 100 Teamsters never received their 
ballots. "It is all hearsay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, police said the windows of the headquarters of Gonzales' 
slate of candidates were shattered by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:49 p.m. Thursday, Oxnard police responded to a call from witnesses who 
heard four or five gunshots on 5th Street. Officers found bullet holes in the 
windows of Gonzales' shop. 
</P>
<P>
"One window is completely gone, and the front-door window is ready to shatter," 
Gonzales said. He said he had no idea who fired the shots but suspected it was 
Teamster-related. 
</P>
<P>
"Where does this stuff stop?" Gonzales asked. "Are they going to fire a few 
shots to scare somebody and muscle their way through to hang onto the union?" 
</P>
<P>
Boverson said, "Don't get me mixed up with that. I don't know anything about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said he heard about the violence during the ballot counting. "Emotions run 
high in these elections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw and the new board of trustees will take office on Monday. He said he has 
scheduled a 9 a.m. meeting with Boverson to plan a smooth transition and to 
discuss long-term changes. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some immediate changes in staff," Shaw said. "Mr. Fry will be 
relieved of his duties and responsibilities when we take over Monday morning." 
</P>
<P>
Other officers elected Friday include Oscar Almeida as president of the board, 
Doug Saint as vice president, Aurora (Junior) Ramirez as recording secretary, 
and Pat Mansfield, Mary "Romero" Blanchard, and Mark Weedon as board trustees.

HOPE'S OFFER ANGERS LAND SWAP CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES and MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Bob Hope's offer to sell and donate 5,700 acres to a state parks 
agency increased pressure on the federal government to approve a controversial 
land swap in Cheeseboro Canyon -- a condition of Hope's offer -- but it did not 
satisfy critics of the swap. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is contingent upon the National Park Service approving a land 
exchange that would allow a developer to build a road through what is now 
federal parkland in Cheeseboro Canyon in Agoura. The road would provide access 
to Hope's Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to continue to fight this," said Wilderness Society official Donald 
Hellmann, "probably even more strongly than before." 
</P>
<P>
Hope agreed this week to transfer the land in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica 
mountains to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for $20 million, a price a 
state park official said is less than Hope could have received from developers. 
</P>
<P>
"One could look at it from that standpoint, that it increases the pressure" to 
approve the land swap, David E. Gackenbach, superintendent of the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials still intend to conduct a thorough environmental review of 
the swap, Gackenbach said. But he added: "It can't help but be favorable to get 
all this additional land for public use." 
</P>
<P>
Hellmann, however, called it "absolutely outrageous" that the Hope agreement is 
"being made contingent on the National Park Service giving away federal public 
lands." 
</P>
<P>
It is "not the job of the Park Service to encourage other people's 
developments," Hellmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy, meanwhile, held a news conference Friday in Malibu to 
celebrate its agreement with Hope. The news conference was held on what would 
have been the 15th hole of a planned golf course at Corral Canyon, where nearly 
200 acres will go to the Park Service instead if the Hope deal is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said the deal with Hope makes 
the Cheeseboro Canyon land swap "certainly much more attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with Hope, the proposed road would be two lanes instead of 
four, so that it would have "a much less significant effect" on Cheeseboro 
Canyon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The road would provide access to Hope's Jordan Ranch, where the conservancy's 
deal with Hope would reduce the number of houses proposed by a developer. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston's support for the land exchange has brought him criticism from its 
opponents, who have said parks agencies should do nothing to facilitate 
development of Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
While likely to deflect criticism of Hope for his prior refusal to discuss 
public ownership of his mountain holdings, the deal also seemed aimed at 
bolstering the conservancy's image by scaling back the Jordan Ranch 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston, in an interview earlier this week, said: "We have been considerably 
bloodied in the press here for what I thought was a good deal," referring to 
the conservancy's longstanding support for the land exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Even before this week's agreement with Hope, Edmiston and the conservancy had 
backed the proposed land swap when the plan called for 400 more proposed houses 
at Jordan Ranch and a more environmentally damaging access road. 
</P>
<P>
The Hope agreement also would free $10 million in conservancy funds to be 
pooled with other money in a bid to acquire a 248-acre parcel in Calabasas 
owned by Tokyo-based Soka University. 
</P>
<P>
"The objective is clearly to target just about the geographical center of the 
Santa Monica Mountains," Edmiston said Friday, pointing to Soka on a map. 
</P>
<P>
Soka officials have said they are not willing to sell the property and expect 
to propose an expansion of the school from 80 to 5,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of Soka's expansion plans prompted Edmiston last week to mention 
condemnation as a possibility if the expansion eventually is approved. On 
Friday, Edmiston would not discuss condemnation and said the conservancy 
planned to press negotiations with Soka officials, who could not be reached for 
comment.

INSECTARY'S BUGS TARGET CITRUS PESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 9,000 acres of orange trees surrounding Fillmore and Piru are swarming with 
insects -- and that's good news to Monte Carpenter, manager of the Fillmore 
Insectary. Servicing the pest-control needs of the 350-member Fillmore Citrus 
Protective District, the insectary has raised and released 20 species of 
beneficial insects since 1926. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years, Carpenter said, less than 5% of the district's total 
acreage has required insecticidal spray. Consequently, some beneficial insects, 
such as ladybugs and green lacewings, have stable and abundant populations. The 
insectary no longer raises them for release in local groves. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation of area growers is what makes it work," Carpenter said. Only 
one or two smaller orchards do not belong to the district, which means that one 
farmer's beneficial insects are not endangered by the management of his 
neighbor's grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you spray for injurious insects, you kill the beneficials as well," 
Carpenter said. Orchards such as those in the San Joaquin Valley "are on a 
pesticide treadmill," he added. 
</P>
<P>
With five full-time workers supplemented by two part-time staff members, the 
insectary raises two insect predators that feed on red and black scale, the 
most prolific citrus pests. About 180 million beneficial insects are released 
annually in member orchards. Spraying is reserved for the rare, heavy 
infestation that defies biological control. JANET BERGAMO

Residents in two Thousand Oaks housing tracts where dangerous fireplaces have 
been installed will soon be compensated for repairs on their faulty hearths, 
city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Barry J. Branagan, the city's director of building and safety, said Thousand 
Oaks is nearing agreement with the insurance companies of an Agoura Hills 
fireplace framer. 
</P>
<P>
The city has accused the framer of placing potentially combustible wood around 
the fireplaces instead of bricks and mortar. 
</P>
<P>
Branagan said the city hopes to announce the details of the agreement next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Thousand Oaks residents, claiming that local building inspectors 
failed to warn them 10 years ago about the dangerous fireplaces, is threatening 
to take the city to court unless the homeowners are compensated. 
</P>
<P>
As result, the city has been attempting to negotiate a settlement with the 
insurance company of the fireplace framer on behalf of the 200 residents in two 
housing developments in the Newbury Park and Wildwood areas. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Angress, who owns a home with a faulty fireplace, said he questions 
whether the city is near an agreement with the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they said last week and the week before," Angress said. "I don't 
want to be negative, but actions speak louder than words." 
</P>
<P>
The claims are a prerequisite to a class-action lawsuit, which would be filed 
in Ventura Municipal Court if negotiations between the city and the insurance 
company fail, Angress said. TINA DAUNT

COUNTING EVERYONE IN THE CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times is to be commended for publicizing another incident of severely 
overcrowded housing in our community ("Owner Cited Over Workers Inhabiting 
Barn," April 6), which is unfortunately an all-too-common occurrence in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
In the piece, my job with the city of Oxnard is described as one of being 
responsible for counting our city's undocumented aliens in the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Census Outreach Program, jointly funded by the cities 
of Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Ventura, has as its goal the inclusion of all 
residents of the three cities in the 1990 census, not just undocumented aliens. 
</P>
<P>
That is why our cities have implemented an aggressive program of going out into 
the community and with pencil in hand assisting residents in filling out the 
somewhat cumbersome census form. Our Censusmobile -- the only one in the 
nation, to our knowledge -- is in the community seven days a week, staffed with 
bilingual volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
We go to shopping centers, mobile home parks, churches and any other places 
where residents gather, in an effort to make sure everyone is counted in this 
census. And just like the U.S. Congress and the Bush Administration, we make no 
distinction when assisting residents in completing the questionnaire. The 
Census Bureau doesn't ask about immigration or legal status, and neither do we. 
</P>
<P>
We believe our unique outreach and assistance effort deserves some mention in 
the Times, and request that the coverage accurately describe our goal and 
mission.

'VERBAL CONTROL' OF PIT BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was appalled to see the photo in the (April 4) Ventura County section showing 
a young woman who "playfully swings her pet pit bull, Gypsy" in the parking lot 
of the Oxnard airport, as the caption stated. 
</P>
<P>
Pit bulls are dangerous dogs, I thought, and to have an animal "known for 
powerful jaws and aggressive behavior," as the caption said, run loose at a 
public airport parking lot sent shivers up my spine. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, the lady at the Ventura County Animal Regulation Department told 
me. As long as the pit bull, Doberman, German shepherd or whatever breed is 
"under the verbal control of the owner," it is perfectly OK to have the animal 
unleashed on public property. I was assured that none of the named breeds are 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Do you suppose that the several recent victims of vicious pit bull attacks 
would agree with the cavalier interpretation of the animal control regulations?

PIERCE ROLLS TO FOUR-GAME VOLLEYBALL WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Handicapping the South Coast Conference volleyball race is child's play: There 
are three teams locked in a battle of king of the mountain, and another nine 
playing follow the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce College -- which, along with Santa Barbara and SCC leader Orange Coast, 
already has clinched a berth in the state tournament -- ran up against El 
Camino, one of the nine have-nots, Friday night and the outcome was 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce cleared its bench in rolling to a four-game win, 15-6, 15-10, 7-15, 
15-8. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas (17-2 overall and in SCC play), who defeated El Camino (9-11 
overall and in the SCC) in three quick games earlier this season, appeared on 
their way to another sweep before Pierce Coach Ken Stanley inserted four 
reserves to start Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino won that game in 19 minutes, and Stanley brought his starters back 
for Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, which has lost to only defending state champion Orange Coast and trails 
the Pirates by a game in the SCC standings, started slowly in Game 4 and 
trailed, 5-1, in the early going. But behind Ed Gilson's four kills and three 
stuff blocks, and Bill Cheesman's six kills, the Brahmas fought back to take an 
8-7 lead and were never headed. 
</P>
<P>
"We came off the bench a little flat, but we picked it up when we got into the 
flow of the (fourth) game," said setter Tyler Bates, a returning All-SCC 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley was never worried about losing momentum -- or the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of confidence in this team," he said. "When they need to do 
something, they do it." 
</P>
<P>
Chad Blatchley led Pierce with 17 kills and Tony Zapata added 16. Gilson and 
Cheesman each finished with 15 kills.

CSUN CLEARS THE AIR THEN SECURES PLAYOFF BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With six matches left in the regular season, a playoff berth seemed assured for 
the Cal State Northridge men's volleyball team -- until a four-game losing 
streak turned certainty into doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors needed at least one victory in their last two matches to clinch 
their first playoff appearance, and both matches were on the road against 
Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
So what does one do? 
</P>
<P>
If you're Coach John Price, you call a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The move might have scored few points for originality, but at least it was 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
After a nearly three-hour meeting April 5, Northridge swept its final two 
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. matches and just might pull an upset 
or two in the WIVA's postseason tournament beginning Wednesday at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Price had called team meetings before but never at such length. "I had no 
intention of it lasting that long," he said, "but there was a lot said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't yelling and screaming. It was mostly me begging and pleading. We 
were really down on ourselves and I was trying to make a point that we were 
still in a great spot." 
</P>
<P>
Price did most of the talking, except when the players asked him to leave so 
they could hash out problems among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
There had been an unusual amount of finger-pointing during the team's losing 
streak, Price said. Some teams might have talent enough to rise above such 
squabbles, but the 1990 Matadors are not among those. 
</P>
<P>
"In volleyball, you really have a lot of egos," Price said. "More teams than 
not rely on pure talent. Our talent alone is not good enough. Our talent is 
good, but we still have to play together and we weren't doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Price reminded the players of already established goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make the league tournament," Price said. "But we also wanted to 
be the type of team that played together, encouraging each other. 
</P>
<P>
"But the point of the whole thing at the end was, is this just talk, or are we 
really going to do what we're talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
So far, it appears as though the players are serious. Northridge is 13-10 and 
ranked eighth in Division I. Since the two wins at BYU, Price said, there has 
not been a bad practice. 
</P>
<P>
Bird in the hand: Price spent most of Thursday morning driving to a recruit's 
home, believing that he would return with a signed letter of intent. Instead, 
the player changed his mind and asked for a few more days to decide. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the life of a college coach. But no matter how frustrating things get 
on the recruiting trail, Price knows that he already has one ace in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ortgiesen, a 6-foot-6 outside hitter, is an impact player waiting in the 
wings. Ortgiesen, a transfer from UC Santa Barbara who is redshirting this 
season, already might be the team's best passer, according to Price. 
</P>
<P>
Prime time: Thursday's setback aside, Price has found a receptive audience on 
the recruiting trail this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, but when you win it's like your opinion is valid all of a sudden," 
Price said. Credit CSUN's three-game sweep of Pepperdine on live cable 
television with an assist. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years on the summer-camp circuit, Price often found himself 
explaining where Northridge was -- even to players from such Southland areas as 
Orange County and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Now when I call a kid or a coach and say, 'I don't know if you're familiar 
with our program, but . . .' They'll say, 'Oh, yeah, I saw you guys on Prime 
Ticket. You guys are good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two-liners: Kevin Franklin, the former Taft High guard and The Times' Valley 
Player of the Year in 1987, has left the Nevada Reno basketball team, citing 
personal reasons. Franklin led Reno in scoring with a 19.2 average last season, 
but he struggled after the death of his mother in January, never again scoring 
more than 20 points in a game. . . 
</P>
<P>
With Scott Sharts back in pitching form, Northridge Coach Bill Kernen has been 
able to set a pitching rotation for the first time this season. CSUN's starters 
in four games next week will be the same as they were this week -- Sharts, 
Craig Clayton, Vale Lopez and freshman John Bushart. . . 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge softball team can secure its eighth consecutive California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship by winning three of four games against 
Cal State Bakersfield and Cal State Dominguez Hills this weekend. CSUN (7-1 in 
conference play) needs at least a split against Bakersfield (10-2), which has 
beaten the Lady Matadors in six of their past eight meetings over two years. . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Percy Knox of Arizona moved into second place on the Pacific-10 Conference list 
in the long jump with a personal best of 26 feet 3 inches in a meet last 
Saturday. As an Antelope Valley High senior, Knox won the 1987 state title. . . 
</P>
<P>
Paavo Salmi, the Cal Lutheran tennis player who suffered a collapsed lung while 
playing in a hockey game last month, returned to the court Thursday when CLU 
played at Westmont. Salmi, who still has separated ribs, will have to work his 
way back up the ladder to the No. 1 position he had held.

GLENDALE GETS THE DROP ON ARCADIA TO SQUEEZE OUT 9-INNING, 3-2 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a matter of five very eventful seconds, Glendale High's Rene Rangel went 
from hero to goat to hero in his team's 3-2 defeat of first-place Arcadia in a 
Pacific League game at Glendale on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded and nobody out in the bottom of the ninth inning, Rivas 
missed a suicide-squeeze sign on an 0-and-1 pitch. Instead of bunting, Rivas 
swung away and banged what seemed destined to be the game-winning hit up the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Arcadia right-hander Randy Martinez stabbed the line drive and turned to 
throw to third base to double up Glendale's Marco Rivas. But Martinez dropped 
Rangel's line drive in the process, allowing Rivas to score the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"If he catches it, he turns two and we're in trouble," Glendale Coach Chris 
Axelgard said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Danny Gray (5-3) threw a six hitter, struck out five and 
walked two. Brent Overfelt was three for four for Glendale (10-5-2, 4-3-1 in 
league play). 
</P>

PLAYER'S ATTACK LED TO SHOOTING, AUTHORITIES SAY

<P>
The Cal State Fullerton football player shot and wounded by an off-duty 
Pasadena police officer outside a popular nightclub allegedly attacked the 
officer before he was shot, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've determined that (Clarence) Siler was participating in the assault on the 
officer," Fullerton Police Sgt. Danny Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
Siler, however, said in an interview from his hospital bed that he is an 
innocent victim of circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Titan defensive end said he was not involved in the Thursday 
morning fight and was only trying to get a teammate away from the crowd when 
the officer drew his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I knew, everybody started running past me. I looked back and 
saw this guy with a gun in his hand. . . . I didn't know he was an officer, I 
just thought he was some guy going crazy."

Siler said he "started to join the pack and run when, bam!, I got shot in the 
back." He fell to the ground and braced himself with his left hand, he said, 
"when, boom! I got hit in the arm. I keep trying to run and then, boom! boom!, 
two more shots were fired. This guy was trying to kill me. I don't why. I think 
he was just picking out the biggest guy in the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Siler stands 6 feet, 4 inches and weighs 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
After the 2 a.m. incident outside the Carnivale Club at 1401 S. Lemon St., 
police arrested Titan players Andrew Fears, 21, and star running back and 
National Football League prospect Mike Pringle, 22, on suspicion of assaulting 
the officer. Both players have been released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Becerra said he expects similar charges to be filed against Siler and other 
players when the investigation by the police and the Orange County district 
attorney's office is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Pasadena Police Officer Darin McBride was tackled and kicked in the 
head by five or six people, most of them football players, after he tried to 
break up a fight between two women in the bar's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
While he was on the ground, McBride apparently grabbed his concealed 
.380-caliber pistol and fired three or four rounds, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating whether the off-duty officer was in a life-threatening 
situation at the time of the shooting. He sustained minor head injuries during 
the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have declined comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Murphy, head football coach at Cal State Fullerton, said he is waiting for 
the police to complete their investigation before he disciplines any players 
for alleged violations of team rules. 
</P>
<P>
After an incident two years ago when an El Toro Marine was beaten to death in a 
barroom brawl with two Titan players, Murphy declared in the team playbook that 
"local bars are off-limits" to team members. 
</P>
<P>
"The punishment is up to me. It could vary," he said. According to the 
playbook, players can be thrown off the team for violating the "no-bars" rule. 
</P>
<P>
In a fight at the school pub last month, two players were suspended from spring 
practice, which is now under way. Fears was one of those players. 
</P>
<P>
Several students around campus said they were annoyed by the behavior of some 
members of the Titan football team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of reading about football players (in fights). If they're part of a 
team, they should have a certain amount of responsibility to the school," said 
Emily Messamer, a senior dance major. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Chase, a sophomore business major, had a similar reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like there have been quite a few incidents involving athletes around 
here," he said. "It reflects poorly on the school. A lot of people perceive Cal 
State Fullerton as a school that is losing credibility, losing its potential. 
You never hear anything like this going on at UCI or UCLA, but you always hear 
things about CSF athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Not all people on campus were critical of the football players. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Bedell, professor of sociology and Academic Senate chairman, said he 
didn't think the athletes' personal lives should be so closely scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time anyone is hurt it's a tragedy, but this happened on their own time, 
it wasn't on university property. Frankly, it's none of our business," Bedell 
said. "If it reflects poorly on the school, that's not fair because these 
people are private citizens. If these were art students, would anyone pay any 
attention to this?"

WILDLIFE: ON ONE HAND, BIRDS AT A CONDO COMPLEX ARE SUSTAINED BY A RESIDENT'S 
SURRUPTITIOUS FEEDINGS. ON THE OTHER, THE CREEKS THEY THRIVE IN HAVE BEEN 
DRAINED.

Each morning before daybreak, Evelyn Leeds crawls out of bed, wraps herself in 
warm clothes and heads into the darkness to break some rules. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with birdseed and a water bucket, Leeds creeps around her condominium 
complex to scatter food for the scores of ducks that have taken up residence in 
ornamental creeks in the development. Such secrecy is needed at the Quail Creek 
complex, where residents caught feeding the ducks are subject to fines at the 
discretion of the homeowners association. So far, Leeds has racked up $400 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me the duck lady of Quail Creek around here," said Leeds, a 
three-year resident of the 300-unit complex. "But it's carnage out there. If 
someone didn't feed those ducks and their babies, they would all die and I 
won't let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Leeds decided to go public with her dilemma after a decision by the homeowners 
association this month to drain the cement-lined creeks, leaving the ducks and 
many recently hatched ducklings wallowing in silt. 
</P>
<P>
She believes the draining is part of an effort to rid the complex of the ducks, 
who now are so numerous that they waddle along Quail Creek sidewalks and 
parking lots. In the last few weeks, Leeds said, at least two ducks have been 
run over by cars and killed. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't know where to go," Leeds said. 
</P>
<P>
Gylver Wagnon, president of the board of directors of the Quail Creek 
Homeowners Assn., said the timing of the creek drainage was unfortunate. Creeks 
must be cleaned periodically, Wagnon said, but the draining was not aimed at 
destroying the mallard and Muscovy ducks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are fonder of the ducks than others and not everyone agrees on how 
to deal with them," Wagnon said. "But I think everyone would have hoped that 
the cleaning and repairing of the creeks would have been finished before the 
baby ducklings came out. Usually, we try to do it during wintertime. But the 
collecting of permits and approvals took longer than expected." 
</P>
<P>
Feeding the ducks is not against the rules, per se, Wagnon said. But if the 
duck population is deemed responsible for damage to the grounds, someone who 
feeds the ducks can also be held responsible, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like feeding the bears at Yellowstone," Wagnon said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation at Quail Creek presents a dilemma for state and federal wildlife 
officials, according to Lt. Mona Cole, supervisor of Orange County wardens for 
the state Department of Fish and Game. While state and federal laws protect and 
regulate migratory and domestic birds and animals, there are no laws governing 
birds residing in man-made creeks that are increasingly becoming part of the 
Southern California landscape, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that is becoming a problem for us," Cole said. "I don't think 
humans have thought this through enough. These are birds and animals who fit 
somewhere between wild and domestic and are extremely dependent." 
</P>
<P>
Whether intentionally or not, developers who install creeks and lakes in their 
projects are likely to lure wild birds and animals who end up relying on humans 
to a certain extent, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you replace nature with some type of pseudo-habitat, you wind up with an 
animal who is dependent on that habitat. Then who is responsible for the 
well-being of these creatures?" Cole asked. "The impacts of development on 
wildlife, especially in a place like Orange County where this is happening so 
quickly, are just now being felt and being studied." 
</P>
<P>
The duck trouble at Quail Creek began to intensify about a year ago when the 
county drained a lake in nearby Laguna Niguel Regional Park, resulting in more 
ducks moving to the condo complex, Leeds said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ducks that were displaced came here and we had an overflow," she said. 
"They were fighting for space and food, quacking loudly, and people started 
complaining." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-April, ducklings began hatching alongside the creeks -- and then they 
were drained. "The babies are getting stuck" in the silt, Leeds said. "It's 
awful to watch." 
</P>
<P>
Another Quail Creek resident, Stephanie Newman, took up the plight of the ducks 
at a Thursday meeting of the homeowners association board. Newman said she 
asked the board what could be done to help the ducks while the creeks were 
drained. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told the duck situation would take care of itself," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the risk of further fines, Leeds said she plans to continue her 
early-morning feedings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible stuff to be forbidden to give them food or water. It's like 
Auschwitz," she said. "This is a beautiful spot outside, but some of the people 
inside are scary."

RIZZITELLO GETS 33 YEARS IN JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE REPUTED MOB UNDER-BOSS'S PRISON TERM STEMS FROM THE 1987 SHOOTING 
OF THE FINANCIER OF A TOPLESS BAR WHO WAS LEFT BLINDED BY THE ATTACK.

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Anthony Rizzitello, a reputed under-boss in the Milano organized crime 
family in Los Angeles, was sentenced to 33 years in prison Friday for shooting 
and blinding a Santa Ana topless-bar financier. 
</P>
<P>
C. William Carroll, shot three times in the back of the head while in a Costa 
Mesa parking garage three years ago, told Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn 
Jr. before the sentencing: "I can't see justice done, but I can hear it. I 
would like to hear it today." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that Rizzitello, 62, tried to kill Carroll, 58, because 
he saw him as a roadblock in the racketeer's attempt to take over the 
now-defunct Mustang Club on Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Just after midnight on May 1, 1987, Carroll rode in a car to the parking garage 
with Rizzitello and Joseph Angelo Grosso, who is already serving a 26-year 
prison term for his part in the shooting. Rizzitello, seated in the back, 
grabbed Carroll from behind and fired as Grosso held Carroll down to prevent 
his escape. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans told the judge that it was "a miracle 
that this was not a completed execution. There's no doubt that when the 
Legislature set up this kind of sentence for this crime, it was with someone 
like (Rizzitello) in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn sentenced Rizzitello to 25 years to life in prison for conspiracy to 
commit first-degree murder. He then added three years for great bodily injury 
to Carroll, two years for use of a firearm, and three more because Rizzitello 
was a convicted felon with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello, who did not testify during trial, made no comment at the 
sentencing. His attorney, Anthony P. Brooklier, said he would immediately file 
an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is not over," the defense lawyer said. "I truly believe that Mr. 
Rizzitello is innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello has a long history of racketeering-related arrests and convictions. 
In 1980, he was one of five people convicted in a major federal organized crime 
case in Los Angeles for which he served five years behind bars. But he also had 
been acquitted in three major cases since -- two involving fraud charges and 
one involving a possible attempt to kill a government witness. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials applauded Rizzitello's conviction and sentencing as a 
major strike against organized crime in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Milano) crime family in many ways has proven to be small and ineffective; 
but within that family, Rizzitello was the one who was clearly capable of 
carrying out violent threats," said Loren W. DuChesne, chief of investigation 
for the Orange County district attorney's office. "This is very significant for 
law enforcement; we're very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the shooting, Carroll was found in a pool of blood in the 
parking garage near the Orange County Performing Arts Center. One of three 
bullets from a .38-caliber handgun severed an optic nerve, destroying his 
eyesight. Another bullet remains in his head. 
</P>
<P>
For 18 months, Carroll refused to tell police who shot him. He agreed to 
cooperate only after a bank fraud case pending against him was reduced by 
prosecutors to a misdemeanor so he could avoid jail. 
</P>
<P>
During Rizzitello's trial, Carroll testified that he had refused to name his 
assailants while the fraud case was pending for fear that Rizzitello would have 
him killed if he ended up serving any time in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
With Carroll out of the way, Rizzitello received $5,000 a week from the Mustang 
Club's profits after threatening manager Gene Lesher that he would be next if 
he didn't cooperate, according to Lesher's testimony. Lesher said he made the 
payments through George (Big George) Yudzevich, the club's bouncer, who worked 
for Rizzitello. 
</P>
<P>
Yudzevich was later found shot to death in an Irvine industrial park. His 
murder is still under investigation. Also pending is an investigation into the 
murder of the original manager at the Mustang, Jimmy Lee Casino, who was gunned 
down at his Buena Park home on Jan. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When Grosso, 46, testified at Rizzitello's trial, he admitted he was in the car 
when Carroll was shot and that Rizzitello was the gunman. But he denied any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both Rizzitello and Grosso argued to jurors that Carroll was 
responsible for both the Casino and Yudzevich murders. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said at Grosso's sentencing hearing in December that having his 
character maligned in public was a heavy price to pay for justice. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Carroll told Judge Flynn that he has a deep sympathy for all victims 
of crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with the right of a fair trial, but I feel for victims who have to go 
through this kind of thing," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll denies any involvement in either the Casino or Yudzevich murders. And 
despite defense claims that Carroll was a primary police suspect in the Casino 
murder, law enforcement officials insist that has never been true. 
</P>
<P>
It was Carroll who gave Casino more than $200,000 in several payments in the 
early 1980s to get the Mustang bar in operation. Because Casino was about to 
default on the loan at the time he was killed, Carroll essentially took over as 
the primary operator of the club. 
</P>
<P>
It was soon after the Casino killing that Grosso, who hung out at the club and 
sometimes drove Carroll around, got him together with Rizzitello. Carroll and 
Rizzitello had known each other in prison at Chino nearly 18 years earlier. 
Rizzitello was serving an armed robbery sentence and Carroll was serving a 
short term for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said after Friday's sentencing that he agreed to renew the old 
acquaintance, but had no idea it might lead to trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello eventually got Carroll to loan him $10,000 for a lingerie business 
that he ran. But Carroll balked at other ventures Rizzitello suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello lawyer Brooklier argued to jurors that his client had no motive for 
shooting Carroll, because Carroll's own testimony showed Rizzitello did not ask 
him for part of the Mustang Club's profits. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors say that Rizzitello concluded before getting to that stage that 
Carroll would not be cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said Friday that the shooting was a complete surprise, because he and 
Rizzitello had not exchanged harsh words. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strictly an ambush," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said Rizzitello told him just before firing the gun: "This is for not 
letting us eat." 
</P>
<P>
Lesher testified that when he met with Rizzitello later, the racketeer told 
him: "Bill Carroll wanted to dine alone . . . you're involved." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said he did "a lot of soul-searching" before deciding to tell 
authorities who shot him. Partly, he said, it was because Rizzitello made 
threats through others to kill him and others in his family if he talked. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said he also was offered $100,000 from someone over the telephone if he 
would not testify against Rizzitello. Carroll said he tape-recorded the call 
and turned the tape over to distict attorney investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rizzitello did not testify at his trial, through his attorney, 
Brooklier, he has denied shooting Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier contends that Carroll named Rizzitello as the gunman only because he 
made a deal with prosecutors that would keep him out of jail on his bank fraud 
charge. Prosecutor Evans has called that argument "ridiculous."

BARBED WIRE HIDES AN IRVINE CO. JEWEL;

ENVIRONMENT: UNDISTURBED FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY, THE BREATHTAKING SCENERY OF 
LIMESTONE CANYON MAY BE OPENED TO THE PUBLIC IN A FEW YEARS.

<P>
The red and white no-trespassing signs that warn visitors away from Limestone 
Canyon are as worn as the rusted barbed wire fence that holds them. The white 
iron gate is locked, and it creaks loudly when it opens, having been used over 
the years by only a handful of visitors and cattle ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the gate, shady glens stretch gently away from the road and over ridges 
draped in wildflowers. Groves of oak trees, some of them hundreds of years old, 
break up the fields and line the creek beds, their dark green set off by the 
lighter splashes of sycamores. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a century, passers-by have paused near the entrance to the 
canyon, straining to see around its bluffs. But they've had to do it from 
behind the fence. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. bought 5,477 acres in and around the canyon in 1868, and since 
that time, the few adventurers who wandered onto the property did so at their 
own risk, knowing that the company's security patrols could loom just over the 
next ridge, waiting to run them off the property. 
</P>
<P>
That could soon change. The company, Orange County's largest landowner, 
announced Thursday that it hopes to open up vast expanses of its private 
properties that have been set aside for future parks. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the areas, including Limestone Canyon, were not expected to become 
parks for more than a decade. But if all goes as planned, Limestone Canyon, the 
largest of the properties to be affected, could open to the public within a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
When it does, Orange County residents will get their first look at one of the 
county's most spectacular natural areas, an expanse of fields and peaks that 
have been protected for decades by the same company that is busily building out 
the valleys dropping away on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the barbed wire, birds and small animals skitter in the fields, foraging 
for food. A dirt road dips into rolling pastureland, richly green in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the year, the land strains for water, but for a few months about this 
time, the mustard blooms bright yellow and the California lilacs open in 
clusters of pale purple. 
</P>
<P>
"We had rain last week, and it's greened it all up," said Mike Stockstill, the 
company's senior director for corporate communications. "The wildflowers are 
really in full bloom." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Cermak, senior director of urban planning and design, nodded from behind 
the wheel of his four-wheel drive during a tour of the land Friday. "Look at 
this little drainage," he said, pointing to a shady creek bed just off the 
road. "Look at the luxuriousness with which the oaks are chockablock." 
</P>
<P>
But if the bulk of Limestone Canyon is in its thick groves of oaks and rolling, 
almost-Irish pastures, the jewels in its crown are the sharp ridgelines with 
views across the entire county and the breathtaking limestone ravine known as 
"the Sinks." 
</P>
<P>
The Sinks sit about a mile from busy Santiago Canyon Road, but the canyon mouth 
faces south and west, cutting off any traffic noise. Limestone deposits in the 
Sinks have eroded over the centuries, leaving a sharp cliff face pocked with 
wear. The cliffs are dusty brown and drop more than 100 feet into a green 
meadow. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only one of its kind in this area," Cermak said. "It is really 
something, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Friday, hawks rode the updrafts that blow up the canyon walls, circling and 
searching for prey. Limestone Canyon, in fact, represents one of the most 
treasured homes for birds of prey, also known as raptors, left in Orange 
County, where development has destroyed the habitats for most of the avians. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the very finest raptor habitats that we have left," said Ginny 
Chester, a former president of the Sea and Sage Audubon Society. Chester was 
active in the effort to secure Limestone Canyon as a park in return for 
developments that the Irvine Co. was allowed to build in Orange and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"It has the trees that are necessary for their nesting sites. It has the fields 
where they hunt . . . and it has the updrafts they need to soar," she added. 
</P>
<P>
With the company now apparently committed to allowing public access into this 
area for the first time, the challenge before environmentalists and company 
officials is to allow people into the park without exposing it to damage. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, the company has kept people out of this land for years, for 
business reasons and other reasons," Stockstill said. "But on the other hand, 
this land has been protected as a result. Now that's going to change." 
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the land at the same time that it opens it, the company has 
indicated that it plans to consult with environmental groups for advice on 
areas that should remain closed to the public. The process is supposed to begin 
within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly when the land will actually open is still undecided, but company 
officials hope to have a plan completed by the end of the year.

Loma Avenue and Imperial Highway as the site of a $5.2-million community 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which was proposed in 1987, was originally planned for the grounds 
of the Yorba Linda Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
But after objections from the Placentia Unified School District, the council 
decided to search for another site. 
</P>
<P>
A report by Steve Rudometkin, director of parks and recreation, said the plan 
for the center calls for the expansion of the adjacent Hurless Barton Park onto 
the four-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Irwin M. Fried said including the park expansion into the plan "is 
an imaginative, innovative approach." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exciting project, and I am very pleased with it," Councilman Roland 
E. Bigonger said. 
</P>
<P>
The 26,000-square foot community center is being designed for the use of senior 
citizens, nonprofit organizations, the Yorba Linda Woman's Club and city 
recreation classes. LINDA M. HICKMAN

Anaheim-based Willdan Associates was selected Friday to provide $50,000 in 
civil engineering advice to the bistate commission overseeing plans for 
high-speed rail service between Anaheim and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Ontario, the California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation 
Commission also approved a $5,000-per-month government relations contract to 
influential county lobbyist Frank Michelena and his Sacramento business 
partner, Paula Treat. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth, who is vice chairman 
of the train panel, abstained on both votes because Treat and Willdan 
contributed money last year to his reelection campaign. In addition, Michelena 
is listed on Roth's statement of economic interest as having provided Roth with 
food and gifts last year. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear) also abstained, for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said the contract awarded to Michelena did not have to be 
open to competitive bidding and was based solely on the recommendation of Paul 
Taylor, the panel's executive director, and the commission's community and 
government relations committee. The contract awarded to Willdan, however, had 
been open to bids. 
</P>
<P>
Also at Friday's session, transportation officials from San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties argued that stations for the proposed high-speed train 
should be built in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
But Roth argued that firms bidding on the right to build and operate the rail 
service have already been told officially that they are to recommend where the 
stations should be. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

FRIENDLY STOP FOR TEEN-AGERS TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last June, officials at the Main Library asked West-Central Orange residents 
what they thought the community needed. The answers have led to the creation of 
Friendly Stop, a drop-in center where local teens can visit or get advice on 
issues ranging from homework to jobs, sex, health and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The library outreach facility, which opens Sunday, will help acquaint students 
with library and community services and will offer programs that address the 
special needs of Latino high school students. Programs for building self-esteem 
and community pride will be offered along with lessons in English language 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony, including a mariachi band, a ribbon-cutting ceremony and 
a performance by local Girl Scouts, begins at 12:30 p.m. in Killefer Park. 
</P>
<P>
Friendly Stop/La Parada de Amistad is the brainchild of a coalition organized 
by the city's Main Library. The coalition included The Friendly Center, a 
community center with a 65-year history in the neighborhood, Holy Family 
Cathedral and about 20 other representatives from city government, churches, 
schools, hospitals and youth groups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a known fact that teen-agers don't use libraries," said Kerry Stern, the 
Main Library program manager who raised more than $100,000 for Friendly Stop 
through a federal grant from the Library Services and Construction Act. "It 
doesn't matter what nationality they are." 
</P>
<P>
A poll of the Killefer Park area last year found that less than half of the 
local teens held library cards and that 54% speak Spanish at home. 
</P>
<P>
Aileen Angel, who spent 17 years in the Orange Unified School District as a 
reading specialist and bilingual teacher, is the Friendly Stop coordinator. 
Angel said the staff is stopping teens on the street to tell them about the 
center. She will also attend high school reading classes and 
English-as-a-second-language courses to discuss tutoring help. 
</P>
<P>
While Friendly Stop targets local youth between 13 and 18 years old, organizers 
also hope that the center will make the library seem a less intimidating place 
for older Latino residents. Organizers said the bilingual staff and resource 
materials will help reach that goal. 
</P>
<P>
Angel admits that the center's goals are ambitious. But, she said, it is only 
responding to community requests. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Angel said, "I am not spending all the (grant) money until I find out 
what we need. I don't want to make the people meet the program, I want the 
program to meet the people." 
</P>
<P>
Friendly Stop hours are Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m.; 
Tuesday and Thursday from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.; and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
It is located at 615A N. Lemon St. in Killefer Park. MARY HELEN BERG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;

<P>
OLD HOUSE NOW HAS A NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flanked by motorcycle officers and curious spectators, one of the oldest houses 
in Tustin inched its way through the heart of town Thursday night in a surreal, 
slow-moving parade. 
</P>
<P>
"Just think, some people in Tustin are sleeping and they don't even know this 
is happening," said Cherie Thompson early Friday morning as she and her 
husband, Jeff, watched their house make its way from 640 W. 1st Street to its 
new home at 415 W. 6th St. 
</P>
<P>
A developer agreed to give the couple the two-story Victorian Italianate house 
about a year ago on the condition that they move it to clear the way for a 
shopping center. Once owned by the sister of the city's founder, Columbus 
Tustin, the 3,600-square-foot, four-bedroom house was most recently used as a 
law office. 
</P>
<P>
The house has been up on blocks for several weeks, but at 11:30 p.m. Thursday a 
12-wheel truck pulled the 150-ton house off the lot, starting a 2 1/2-mile trip 
that took 10 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Though city workers removed arms from two traffic signals and arborists sawed a 
few limbs off trees to make way for the house, it did not escape damage -- two 
broken windows, chipped paint and a few lost shingles. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 60, including the mayor and his wife, turned out to witness 
the trip. Some spectators walked, some drove and many snapped pictures. Parents 
brought their children and several teen-agers did the bunny hop on the sidewalk 
about midnight before fatigue set in. Jeff Thompson videotaped the highlights 
of the move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just an experience to watch them save this old house," said Nola Collins, 
who lives in an 1889 house on A Street with her husband, Russ, and their three 
children. "I don't know how I'm going to get them up in the morning, but in the 
long run, it's worth it. They live in an old house and it's good for them to 
see this one saved." 
</P>
<P>
"In Newport and Laguna, they've got to save the whales," Russ Collins added. 
"We've got to save the houses." 
</P>
<P>
The journey went fairly smoothly until 5 a.m., when movers hit a snag. The 
telephone company had not raised the wires high enough for the house to pass 
under. Police officers put in an emergency call, but as the word spread that it 
would be at least 90 minutes before the wires were raised, the crowd began to 
thin. It was not until 10 a.m. Friday that the house actually reached its 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
While the move itself was difficult, planning for it was not much easier. The 
event was delayed four times. 
</P>
<P>
"We never imagined there'd be so much work," said Jeff Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Besides negotiating with the developer, the couple had to get city approval of 
all plans, complete a structural analysis of the house, demolish an existing 
house and grade the new lot, and develop the utility tie-in plans. They 
circulated a petition to drum up neighborhood support, built their own basement 
and notified people along the route. 
</P>
<P>
But the couple ran into controversy over historic trees along the route, 
particularly along 6th Street, a 40-foot-wide street barely able to accommodate 
the 40-foot-wide house. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most troublesome trees was in front of the house of Andy Anderson, 
who has lived on 6th Street for 35 years. Anderson opposed the plan and posted 
a sign on his front lawn reading: "Any man can make a house but only God can 
make a tree." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson insisted that the house should be cut in half to preserve the trees, 
but the Thompsons said that would add $50,000 to what was an already-expensive 
move. 
</P>
<P>
Tree specialists waited until the house reached Anderson's home before trimming 
the avocado tree. Only a few branches had to be pruned, and Anderson said 
Friday afternoon that the move went better than he had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
It will be four to six weeks before the Thompsons and their 5 1/2-month-old 
baby can occupy the house. They must still complete a foundation, hook up 
utilities and move in. SHANNON SANDS

ANAHEIM GRANDMOTHER WINS $5.2-MILLION SWEEPSTAKES; 
</P>
<P>
CONTEST: EVELYN MCKENNA, 83, SAYS SHE'S NEVER BEEN LUCKY UNTIL NOW. SHE'LL 
SHARE HER READER'S DIGEST MONEY WITH HER CHILDREN.

An 83-year-old Anaheim grandmother, who said she rarely plays the California 
Lottery and doesn't normally consider herself a lucky person, was the winner of 
$5.2 million in this year's Reader's Digest sweepstakes, magazine officials 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn McKenna said she hardly noticed the prize when it came to her house in a 
bulky package about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up and puttering around the house when a deliveryman knocked on the 
door," McKenna, who will turn 84 next month, said Friday. "I just put it aside 
and had my breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, McKenna said she decided to give the odd-looking letter the 
once over. And once she read that she was the Reader's Digest $5.2-million 
winner, she said she just knew it was true. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be negative about it, so I believed it was true," said the 
widow in a telephone interview from Reader's Digest headquarters in 
Pleasantville, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, a 20-year resident of Anaheim who said she sometimes teaches courses 
in metaphysics for her church and other social groups, was flown first-class to 
New York City on Thursday night with her son, who lives in Utah, said Craig 
Lowder, public relations director for Reader's Digest. Lowder said the two are 
spending an all-expenses-paid weekend in New York, including a Broadway show 
and rooms at the plush Waldorf Astoria Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"They treat me as if I'm the Queen of England -- no, the Queen of Sheba," 
McKenna said. "It's all so upbeat, it's positive, it's loving." 
</P>
<P>
Lowder said McKenna beat odds of 1-in-150 million. 
</P>
<P>
The winner said her only plans for her new fortune are to share it with her 
children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. When she had heart 
surgery about 18 months ago, McKenna said her children were her main support. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a small home and I'm very comfortable there," she said. "I want to 
share whatever I have with them." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna has received her first of 30 annual installments for $167,000, plus a 
$120,000 early-entry bonus check from George V. Grune, chairman and chief 
executive officer for Reader's Digest, Lowder said. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said she has played the magazine's sweepstakes for "a lot of years," 
but rarely plays other contests -- such as the California Lottery -- and 
doesn't think of herself as a lucky person. 
</P>
<P>
She also said the prospect of a new life with a six-figure income worries her. 
And if the changed lives of past Reader's Digest winners are any indication, 
her hunch might be well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
"You get goofy people calling you," said Ira Vernon Pfile, 75, last year's 
$5-million winner. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from his home in Carleroi, Pa., Friday, Pfile said he and his 
wife were answering about 50 calls a month from people with investment schemes 
or looking for donations. "By now it's tapered off, but we do get a lot of mail 
still from cuckoos," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But McKenna seems ready to trade a little immediate privacy for her new-found 
millions. "I'm thinking this is all a wonderful opportunity," she said. "It's 
like a beautiful celebration."

<P>
A reputed gang member with a long criminal history was sentenced to death 
Friday for killing a Santa Ana church elder as the victim prayed for mercy in a 
telephone booth a few feet from where his wife looked on in horror. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Jean Matusinka ordered Tracy Lavelle 
Carter, 22, of Los Angeles, to die in the gas chamber for the first-degree 
murder of David Eugene Thompson, an elder of the Greater Zion Apostolic Church 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant has engaged in a pattern of violent conduct that indicates a 
serious danger to society," Matusinka said. "You should suffer the death 
penalty within the vaults of San Quentin." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, wearing leg irons, white basketball sneakers and a blue jail jumpsuit, 
removed his glasses and began to sob at the defense table as Matusinka spoke. 
Earlier, he had whispered to his relatives in the audience and rocked back and 
forth in his chair. 
</P>
<P>
"I love you all," he yelled to his family as sheriff's deputies led him away 
after sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 2, a jury convicted Carter on two counts of first-degree murder 
stemming from the shooting deaths of Thompson, 27, of Tustin, and Leopoldo 
Salgado, 48, of Los Angeles, on April 9, 1987. Both were robbed and killed 
within 90 minutes of each other in South-Central Los Angeles during an attempt 
by Carter and two other young men to obtain money for beer and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, the jury recommended that Carter be put to death for 
Thompson's death and receive life in prison without the possibility of parole 
for the slaying of Salgado. Judge Matusinka formally imposed those sentences 
during Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"He deserved it," said Catherine Thompson, who added that she has had two 
strokes following the death of her son, David. "If it had been anything less I 
would have been devastated. My son was a fabulous man. He was taken away. . . . 
He who liveth by the sword shall die by the sword. All I want is justice." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was killed in a service station telephone booth at Slauson Avenue and 
Broadway, where he had gone to call for help after a bus from his church broke 
down during an outing. As his wife, Namora, waited in their car, three men 
accosted them and took $10 from her purse. 
</P>
<P>
Court testimony showed that Carter then turned on Thompson, whose hands were 
pressed together in prayer. "Hallelujah, hallelujah," Thompson said before he 
was fatally shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the men took Thompson's 1986 Hyundai and drove to a liquor store 
where they bought cigarettes and beer. They returned to the store later and 
shot Salgado when and a friend refused to give them money. 
</P>
<P>
"The death penalty was justified," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Ingalls, the 
prosecutor. "He put a gun to a good man's head who was praying for mercy and he 
killed him." 
</P>
<P>
Before sentencing, defense attorney Susan Wolk argued that Carter should either 
receive a new trial or a reduced sentence of life in prison because the jury 
recommended two different punishments in November. Matusinka rejected the 
argument without comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was fair at all," said Carter's mother, Audry. "Tracy is my 
only son. Tracy is basically a good person. He was home that night, and he 
should have stayed home. How can you spend your life on death row at 22 -- 30 
years waiting to die." 
</P>
<P>
Matusinka had the power to reject the jury's recommendation of the death 
penalty, but she imposed the sentence, citing the two killings and Carter's 
lengthy criminal history. Those facts, she said, outweighed defense arguments 
in favor of a life sentence -- Carter's age and expression of remorse for the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
Court and prison records show that Carter, who is a member of the 74 Hoover 
Crips street gang, has been in continuous trouble with the law since his first 
robbery and malicious mischief convictions at age 11. Except for 14 months of 
freedom, Carter has been serving time in Los Angeles County Jail and the 
California Youth Authority for the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to accept. My client is a human being," said Anthony Alexander, 
Carter's other defense lawyer. "I definitely feel he feels remorse for the 
entire situation. I think he understands this is a tragedy for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Carter is the last of three people to be convicted and sentenced in the 
slayings. Last year, Andre Moore, 20, an accomplice, was sentenced to 32 years 
to life in prison, while Todd Lavera, 26, received 58 years to life in prison.

UC IRVINE ORDERED TO HOLD HEARING ON PROFESSOR'S GRIEVANCE;

A UC Irvine math professor won a partial victory Friday when a Superior Court 
judge ordered the university to hold a formal hearing over a decision to 
require him to teach eight classes a year -- almost double his previous load. 
</P>
<P>
While university officials downplayed the significance of the ruling, math 
professor Frank Cannonito and others called it a victory that guarantees the 
right of all 10,000 University of California faculty members to a full hearing 
of their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say it's a big victory," said the 25-year professor. "I think an 
important procedural right of faculty has been established." 
</P>
<P>
Cannonito had asked the court to reduce his teaching load to the previous 4 1/2 
courses a year, arguing that he had been deprived of valuable research time 
without a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore declined to decide that issue but ruled 
that a UCI Academic Senate committee's review of Cannonito's grievance last 
year was "inadequate." She ordered the university to hold a hearing on the 
professor's grievance, one that would permit him to provide evidence and call 
witnesses if he chose. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Friday what faculty body would hold the hearing, or how soon. 
But even before Cannonito stepped into Moore's Santa Ana courtroom Friday, the 
dispute over his teaching load was moot. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald J. Stern, the new chairman of UCI's mathematics department, told 
Cannonito on Wednesday that he would be teaching only five classes for the 
1990-91 academic year. If that decision stands, Cannonito said, he may decide 
not to pursue a further hearing, despite the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to argue about a half a course," said Cannonito, an expert in 
algebraic aspects of computing. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not he demands a hearing, Cannonito said, the judge's order 
vindicated him and clarified the Board of Regents rules on such personnel 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Stern agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what happened (in court) was a good decision," said the chairman, who 
took over the department in January and was not involved in decisions about 
Cannonito's course load or promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think every faculty member needs a safety valve for their grievances," Stern 
said, "and they should be allowed a hearing before an impartial body. The court 
ruling today guaranteed that." 
</P>
<P>
"The way I interpret the ruling is that the UC Regents should allow an 
opportunity for a (formal) hearing in all cases," said Stern, who was in the 
courtroom to hear the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
Edward M. Opton Jr., counsel for the university and the Board of Regents, said 
the university probably would not appeal the judge's order. But he predicted 
that Moore's ruling -- which is not binding in other jurisdictions -- would 
have little practical impact. 
</P>
<P>
"There just aren't very many complaints of the type Prof. Cannonito filed," 
UptonOpton said. 
</P>
<P>
In Cannonito's case, it was a policy of the mathematics department and the 
School of Physical Sciences that professors with active research programs teach 
four classes a year. Those who did some research would teach six courses. Those 
who did little or no research would have eight classes. 
</P>
<P>
When Cannonito was passed over twice in the last five years for promotion and 
it was determined that he was not producing much in the way of research, it was 
decided that his course load would be increased to eight, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Cannonito has argued that the last review of his teaching and research efforts 
took place when he was in the Soviet Union as part of a University of 
California exchange program with Leningrad University. His absence, he said, 
prevented him from contesting the review conclusions. When he filed the 
grievance over the subsequent class reassignments and demanded a hearing, a 
faculty committee said the procedures followed were proper and that his case 
had been given sufficient hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The university takes the position that if you request a hearing in a letter 
and somebody reads the letter, that constitutes a hearing," Cannonito said 
after the verdict. "That's laughable."

19-YEAR-OLD TELLS OF JUVENILE HALL TIE-DOWNS;

<P>
LAWSUIT: ANOTHER FORMER DETAINEE DESCRIBES DISCIPLINE IN TESTIMONY AIMED AT 
CHANGING PRACTICES AT THE COUNTY FACILITY.

<P>
A 19-year-old man testified Friday that he paid for misbehavior in Juvenile 
Hall by being bound to his bed frame for up to eight hours at a time, an 
experience that left his legs wobbly and his hands blue, swollen and numb for 
up to two days. 
</P>
<P>
Identified in court as Cliff Lacy, he admitted that he was no angel: He broke 
the hall rules many times, screamed and swore at staff members and disobeyed 
their orders. But he said he did not deserve to be tied down, as he was more 
than 10 times, or stripped to his underwear and put into a padded room, which 
happened on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy, who was admitted to Juvenile Hall seven times in from 1984 to 1988, was 
the second former detainee to testify in a trial that challenges the way 
adolescents are treated at the Orange facility. Civil rights attorneys allege 
that staff members put the teens into "rubber rooms" and subject them to 
soft-tie restraints too frequently and without sufficient cause. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the lawsuit seeks to restrict the use of padded rooms and 
soft-tie restraints and give minors greater access to their attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not right to be tied down," Lacy testified, explaining why he usually 
kicked, screamed, bit and spat at staffers who carried him to his room to be 
tied down. "It's humiliating. You ain't got no control over yourself. You're 
helpless." 
</P>
<P>
Lacy, now serving a one-year term in Orange County Jail for robbery and assault 
with a deadly weapon, was brought into Superior Court in a yellow jail 
jumpsuit, his hands chained to his waist and his feet chained close together. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy testified that he usually ended up in soft-tie restraints or a rubber room 
because he broke "stupid" Juvenile Hall rules, such as talking too loud, 
tipping his chair back on two legs in the day room or getting a book from the 
library shelf against a staff member's orders. 
</P>
<P>
Each time, he would refuse orders to go to his room, so staff members would 
pick him up and carry him there. He testified that after he banged on his door 
and cursed loudly for five or 10 minutes, six or seven staff members would come 
into his room and bind him to the bed. 
</P>
<P>
"My hands would swell up . . . and I couldn't walk for the first couple hours 
out of ties," he testified. "My hands would be blue and swollen. . . . 
Sometimes you wouldn't get the feeling back (in your hands) for a couple of 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Lacy said staff members and mental health counselors made no effort to calm him 
down before subjecting him to soft-tie restraints or putting him into a padded 
room. He testified that staff members frequently taunted him while he was 
confined. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd say, 'How do you like it, little one?' " Lacy said. "Or, 'Those aren't 
too loose, are they?' . . . Or (when he was in the padded room), 'Is it warm 
enough in there?' when they knew damn well it was cold. Or, 'Too bad you can't 
have your clothes back.' " 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, David G. Epstein, a private attorney representing the 
county, painted Lacy as a perennial troublemaker and an impossible discipline 
problem. Lacy admitted that he purposely flouted Juvenile Hall rules because he 
said they were "unfair." He also admitted using racial epithets against black 
staff members. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that being in a padded room was not one of the worst 
experiences in his life and that he has suffered no lasting effects from being 
tied down. But he surmised that had he not been tied down he "might have had a 
little more respect for authority." 
</P>
<P>
Another former detainee, a 17-year-old identified as Melissa P., testified that 
she had to sleep on a mattress on the floor in a cold, drafty room where bugs 
crawled out of a hole in the wall, and that she got inadequate medical care 
when she was seriously ill for four days. 
</P>
<P>
Both witnesses testified that they were strip-searched after each trip to court 
and visit with an outsider and that they often had trouble winning permission 
to call their attorneys or have them visit.

COLUMBIA S&amp;L PUTS NEWPORTER ON THE BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., pounded by losses on its junk-bond 
investments and under regulatory pressure to sell off much of its real estate, 
has put the Hyatt Newporter hotel here up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In documents recently filed with the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the thrift said it had hired a financial adviser late last year to 
market the Newporter, the first big resort hotel built in Newport Beach. 
Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, expects to sell the Newporter before the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Newporter, built in 1962, was instrumental in the development of Orange 
County's beaches as a major tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
But business has been tough on the Newporter, which has had five owners in 28 
years, as newer hotels lured away many of its customers. And it faces still 
more competition when up to three new hotels -- one of them also operated by 
Hyatt -- open in the next few years on the nearby hills overlooking the coast 
between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, part of the ambience of what many local residents consider "Old 
Newport Beach," is a kind of landmark from the days when the beach city was 
still a small town. Still, with 415 rooms, the Newporter is among the 15 
largest hotels in the county. 
</P>
<P>
When Richard M. Nixon was President in the early 1970s and staying at his San 
Clemente estate, politicians and reporters frequently stayed at the Newporter. 
The guest register once also listed the likes of John Wayne and Diana Ross. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift won't say what it's asking for the Newporter. But Le Meridien, a few 
miles inland and about the same size, brought an estimated $65 million from a 
Hong Kong investor last year. 
</P>
<P>
And it's also likely that a Far East investor may buy the Newporter, local 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, already among the largest foreign investors in U.S. real estate, 
like to invest in hotels because -- unlike office-building rents -- hotel room 
rates can be raised more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong investors are said to be looking for more purchases in the United 
States as 1997 draws nearer, when the British colony reverts to China. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the hotel is up for sale has been kept quiet by Columbia, perhaps 
because, said a hotel consultant, "foreign investors don't like a lot of 
publicity around these types of transactions." 
</P>
<P>
"Offshore investors won't usually consider a property if they know it's being 
marketed widely," said David Philp, a hotel consultant at the Newport Beach 
office of accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia bought the hotel, located on Jamboree Boulevard, for $26 million in 
1985 from Ridgeway Ltd. of Newport Beach. Ridgeway had owned the hotel only 
since 1981 and spent more than $12 million renovating it. But occupancy rates, 
the company said then, continued to decline. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia spent more on sprucing up the hotel and adding another 100 rooms to 
compete with the newcomers up the street at Fashion Island and at John Wayne 
Airport a few miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until last year that Hyatt took over management of the hotel. The 
firm had been looking for hotels to manage in the airport and Newport Beach 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hyatt finally signed an agreement with the Irvine Co., the huge 
Newport Beach landowner, to build a new hotel in the Newport Coast development. 
The Hyatt hotel will be one of three overlooking the seashore between Newport 
Beach and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt began trying to promote the Newporter as a place for business travelers 
and corporate meetings, and the consultant selling the hotel for Columbia says 
that business is now "trending upward." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel sits on 26 acres and has its own small golf course, an unusually 
large amount of land for a hotel these days. But the hotel doesn't own the 
land; it leases it under a 1981 agreement with the Irvine Co., and that lease 
runs to the year 2048. 
</P>
<P>
That could complicate a sale, experts say, because foreign investors in 
particular like to own the land under the buildings they buy. A lease also 
makes it more difficult to borrow money to make the purchase. The county's 
hotel market isn't booming, either. It is overbuilt after a wave of new hotels 
were constructed in the middle and late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The occupancy rate in Newport Beach and around the airport averaged 63.6% last 
year, according to Pannell Kerr Forster's estimate, up little more than 3% from 
four years before. That means room rates have also stayed anemic, up to an 
average of only $74.83 a room from $72.01 four years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But the Newporter has an advantage in that it is still partly a resort hotel, 
even though the new Dana Point Resort and the Ritz-Carlton right on the water 
in Dana Point have outflanked it. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels for business travelers have suffered the most from the competition, 
while the handful of hotels along the coast have done pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia has to dump most of its real estate under new federal regulations 
designed to prevent another savings and loan disaster, when thrifts that 
dabbled rashly in real estate wound up losing billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Newporter is actually owned by a Columbia subsidiary which the 
thrift says isn't subject to the new regulations, the S&amp;L decided to sell 
the hotel too. It won't say why, but the sale probably reflects unsatisfactory 
returns on the money that Columbia sank into expanding and renovating the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's problems, however, didn't come from commercial real estate, where 
its investments total less than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the thrift made huge investments in the junk-bond market, which was 
already shaky when new regulations forced thrifts to divest their junk 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Although Columbia was rendered insolvent and may not survive as an independent 
institution, the thrift's financial adviser on the hotel sale says that won't 
affect the price which, he says, "is reasonable but not a bargain." 
</P>
<P>
The adviser, Laurence Geller of Chicago hotel consultant Geller &amp; Co., says 
he has been approached by several prospective buyers -- not all of them Asian 
-- and a sale could come soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring is in the air," he said, "and people like to buy real estate in the 
spring."

PRICIER HOMES PLANNED BY RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA

<P>
Rancho Santa Margarita is going upscale. 
</P>
<P>
The South County planned community -- responsible for much of the affordable 
new housing being built in Orange County these days -- has opened nine new 
single-family and attached-housing developments around the upper portion of the 
Tijeras Creek public golf course set to open in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Prices start about $140,000, still way down there in affordable territory, but 
not all the homes will be that inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
Units next to the golf course fairways will be priced at more than $400,000 -- 
the most expensive in the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of a golf course, however, doesn't mean Rancho Santa Margarita is 
abandoning the affordable market. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the street from the golf course homes and scheduled to open in June 
is a condominium development by Newport Beach-based Inland Pacific Communities. 
It will offer 608-square-foot units with one bedroom, one bath and a single-car 
garage for less than $100,000 apiece. The exact price hasn't been set yet. 
</P>
<P>
Top price in the development will be in the mid-$150,000s for a two-bedroom, 
two-bath unit, said Gail Zalta, spokeswoman for the 2-year-old firm. 
</P>
<P>
Inland Pacific hasn't opened any models yet, but about 500 would-be home buyers 
already have asked to be included on an information list, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The development will have about 250 units, and only 30 or so are to be offered 
in the first phase. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they go up for sale, the Inland Pacific homes might carry the only 
sub-$100,000 price tags in Rancho Santa Margarita. Currently, one other 
attached-home development -- by the William Lyon Co. -- still has a few units 
priced at $98,000.

LOS LOBOS MEMBERS PACK 'EM IN AT 'GUITAR CLINIC' IN O.C.; 
</P>
<P>
MUSICIANS: DAVID HIDALGO AND TWO OTHERS FROM THE ACCLAIMED EAST L.A. BAND 
ENGAGED IN A BIT OF INFORMAL 'SHOW AND TELL' AT THE LA HABRA MUSIC CENTER.

<P>
"Anybody got a pick?" asked David Hidalgo as he took the stage Thursday night, 
and half the crowd of 60 or so dug into their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it was a musician's crowd packing the small and stuffy rehearsal 
room at La Habra Music Center, a music store, for what had been billed as a 
guitar clinic with Hidalgo, guitarist, singer and songwriter for the acclaimed 
band Los Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
But "guitar clinic" was really too formal a description for the affair, which 
unfolded as a freewheeling mix of brief question-and-answer sessions 
interspersed with old-fashioned jams featuring two of Hidalgo's bandmates, 
guitarist and singer Cesar Rosas and drummer Louie Perez, along with several 
members of a local group, the Delgado Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of Los Lobos signature songs, Hidalgo and company opted for some old 
blues chestnuts and one Mexican folk tune. There was even a quick rendition of 
"Purple Haze" -- with Hidalgo's 12-year-old son on drums and Perez's 
13-year-old son doing a serviceable Hendrix turn on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Things got off to a late start after band members were delayed at the Hollywood 
studio where they are recording their new album, due in June. Unlike their last 
album, the all-acoustic, Spanish-language "La Pistola Y El Corazon," the new 
one will be more in keeping with the earlier "How Will the Wolf Survive?" and 
"By the Light of the Moon." 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a rock 'n' roll record," Hidalgo told the audience. It will, 
however, incorporate many of the obscure folk instruments he has picked up in 
his prowls of pawn shops. "Again, we're trying to mix things up," Hidalgo said, 
promising more of the musical diversity that has been the band's trademark. 
"We're just trying to keep things fun, and interesting for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Audience questions ranged from the technical ("What kind of amps do you use?") 
to the personal. Several asked the members of the group, who have earned 
consistent critical raves and a large popular following, to share their secrets 
of success. 
</P>
<P>
According to Perez, it has boiled down to persistence, along with some 
fortuitous timing. "We kind of got out there when the club scene was pretty 
open. Nobody was charging people to play," he said, referring to the current 
"pay-to-play" policy at many clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, because of "greedy promoters," Perez continued, "there's a lot of talent 
out there that deserves to be seen, but there's no place for them to go." 
</P>
<P>
Perez, Hidalgo and Rosas reminisced about their early days in East Los Angeles. 
"We used to get together at Cesar's mom's house and sit in the back yard and 
eat string cheese," Hidalgo recalled. 
</P>
<P>
They started out as a rock band, but "in the early '70s, that started getting a 
little old," Hidalgo said. They started turning to acoustic folk music as a way 
to "fight the boredom" before reintroducing some of the electric elements in 
1980.

<P>
They found a niche alongside some of the roots-rock groups that were playing in 
Los Angeles, including the Blasters, who helped Los Lobos connect with Slash 
Records. "How Will the Wolf Survive?" was released on Slash in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos' visibility was boosted by Paul Simon's 1986 "Graceland," to which 
the band contributed one song. For band members, though, the experience left 
some less-than-pleasant memories. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we were going to record some songs that he had written," Rosas 
said. But the band discovered that Simon's approach was closer to, as Hidalgo 
described it, " 'Get some ethnic types in there and let them play, and I'll 
write a song over it. ' " 
</P>
<P>
After three unproductive days in the studio, the band finally wrote a song on 
the spot, Rosas said. But when the album was released a year later, the band 
received no songwriting credit. "That hurt my feelings," said Rosas, who 
offered the story as a warning to other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Other topics discussed at the La Habra Music Center included songwriting 
techniques, the group's recording of the "La Bamba" soundtrack, rehearsing and 
the perils of the road. Hidalgo told the audience to be receptive to new forms 
of music and extolled the virtues of everything from country to African pop. 
</P>
<P>
"So with that in mind," he said, re-slinging his guitar, "we're going to play 
some more blues."

THE SOUND OF FRISHBERG; 
</P>
<P>
PIANIST / SINGER WRITES SONGS THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY -- WITH MELODY, HARMONY AND 
WIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's kind of hard to imagine David Frishberg singing "I Write the Songs," 
though that's certainly what Frishberg does. Maybe not the smash hit songs like 
Barry Manilow's or Billy Joel's or Stephen Sondheim's, but the little hits such 
as "I'm Hip," "My Attorney Bernie," "Peel Me a Grape" and "The Underdog" that 
have become legendary among jazz fans and lovers of more arcane pop. The 
Frishberg oeuvre currently comprises more than 100 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The pianist/songwriter/lyricist/singer, who will play solo Sunday at 3 in 
Founders Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, has concocted 
ditties on his own and in collaboration with the likes of Johnny Mandel, Bob 
Dorough, Al Cohn and Alan Broadbent, with whom he wrote his latest, "Heart's 
Desire." 
</P>
<P>
"Alan sent me this lovely melody and I wrote lyrics to it," Frishberg recalled 
from his home in Portland, Ore. Even though all the kinks in the new song may 
not yet be worked out, Frishberg said, he'll debut it during his Southern 
California sojourn which also includes a stop at the Cal State University Long 
Beach student union on Tuesday and an engagement May 2 through May 5 at the 
Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Frishberg tries to write songs in the Tin Pan Alley tradition, going for 
melodic and lyric content rather than flash or glitz. "I'm not interested in 
writing effects or grooves or moods," he said in the buoyantly scratchy tenor 
that closely resembles his singing voice. "I'm really interested in writing a 
song the old-fashioned way. The challenge is to make a really good melody, 
harmonize it in an ingenious way, and come up with something I'm proud of." 
</P>
<P>
As much as he likes to knock out the numbers, he doesn't do it all the time. 
"I'm not a compulsive writer and never have been," he said. "I always write 
when there's a project. Once I have an assignment, a deadline and a goal, I 
really take care of business." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Frishberg's freshest can be found on "Let's Eat Home," a CD recently 
released by Concord Jazz. Among the numbers: 
</P>
<P>
* "Brenda Starr," Mandel's theme from the as-yet-unreleased film, to which 
Frishberg attached a lyric written "in the spirit of comic strips, though I 
don't remember ever reading 'Brenda Starr' per se." 
</P>
<P>
* "Matty," a tome "sung by someone who saw Christy Mathewson, the great New 
York Giants pitcher, play ball." 
</P>
<P>
* The title track, with lyrics that are a typical Frishberg meld of sentiment 
and merriment. 
</P>
<P>
These days, though, Frishberg said, he isn't writing as humorously as he has in 
the past. "Lately, I find that my lyric writing is not out to get laughs like 
it used to, and I don't know what that means," he said. "I certainly like to 
keep humor in my songs." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, "Let's Eat Home," Frishberg's first for Concord in more than 10 
years (he's also recorded for Omnisound and Fantasy) doesn't neglect his 
pianistic talents. Those are what the St. Paul, Minn. native cashed in on when 
he moved to New York City in 1957, and for more than a decade, until he moved 
West, he played with many of his idols, including saxophonists Ben Webster, Al 
Cohn and Zoot Sims and trumpeter Roy Eldridge. (Frishberg moved to Los Angeles 
in 1971 and then to Portland four years ago). 
</P>
<P>
Frishberg's live shows feature plenty of piano too. Currently he's including 
songs by Cohn, who is definitely a personal favorite, and Duke Ellington's 
alter ego, Billy Strayhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Each of his sets includes a medley, a practice that's "fun and it keeps me 
learning tunes," he said. "I also learn about programming tunes, how to group 
them. And since I like to play a lot of different ways, the medley lets me do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Frishberg described his approach: "When I play, I try to keep the sound, the 
color and the texture different. Sometimes I like a full stride style, 
sometimes just two fingers creating two voices against each other. Sometimes I 
like a feeling that harks back to older styles. Other times I want to be more 
free and take a few chances." 
</P>
<P>
He has been influenced by various keyboardists throughout his career: from 
boppers like Bud Powell, Hank Jones and Al Haig to swing era greats Ellington 
and recent Pulitzer Prize-winner (and former Benny Goodman-ite) Mel Powell. But 
Jimmy Rowles, whom Frishberg first heard with Woody Herman's Woodchoppers in 
1949, is the current apple of his ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot about Rowles," Frishberg said. "Sometimes I even find myself 
saying as I'm playing, 'I wonder what this would sound like if Jimmy Rowles 
were playing it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Why Rowles? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it gets back to the same question of colors and textures and different 
sounds," Frishberg answered. "I've never heard anyone control . . . ," he 
paused for a moment to think ". . . the tones at the keyboard the way he does." 
</P>
<P>
Frishberg the pianist has never been one to shout about Frishberg the singer. 
He will admit, though, that he gets the job done. 
</P>
<P>
"I never try to sell my singing," he laughed. "The songs are what I'm talking 
about. They're what I'm putting across. 
</P>
<P>
"My voice is erratic, since I very seldom sing unless I'm working. I never 
practice, I don't even know how to warm up, so I don't try to challenge my 
voice too much. Still, I seem to get across." 
</P>
<P>
Frishberg didn't sing much until the early '70s, when he began demonstrating 
his own songs. Before then, even though he had been writing lyrics and tunes, 
he was mainly known as a jazz pianist. In Los Angeles, where he moved to work 
on a TV show ("The Funny Side," which lasted one season), he wrote tunes and 
played in area bands such as Bill Berry's L.A. Big Band. In the mid-'70s, he 
started his solo career and has been at it successfully ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Does he feel like somewhat of an anachronism, writing and playing in a style 
that was in vogue about half a century ago? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I see myself as someone who continues to thrive on what charmed me when I 
was a kid," he said. "Count Basie, Johnny Mercer, Gilbert and Sullivan . . . ,' 
he laughed at the mention of their names. "Bing Crosby, Benny Goodman -- I've 
never really gotten over all that. For me, it's like getting back in touch with 
the truth." 
</P>

 David Frishberg plays Sunday at 3 p.m. in Founder's Hall at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $18.

TRIBAL TECH TAKES ELECTRIC EXCURSIONS BACK TO CAMPFIRE DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: THE BAND, WHICH PLAYS MONDAY AT HAMPTONS IN SANTA ANA, IS ALSO DEMOCRATIC 
ENOUGH TO MAKE ITS SETS 'FUN TO PLAY,' AS WELL AS WORTH THE LISTEN. 
</P>

<P>
Those countries trying to establish themselves as new democracies well might 
take a lesson from guitarist Scott Henderson and his band, Tribal Tech. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had a major band meeting the other night," Henderson, 35, said last 
week from his home in Highland Park. "Everybody was calling me and complaining 
about one of my pieces, saying it was boring to play." 
</P>
<P>
Though half the members of Tribal Tech have been in the group less than a month 
(keyboardist John Beasley and drummer Joey Heredia have joined Henderson and 
bassist Gary Willis), Henderson listened. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to delete some material" from the song, he said, "make it more fun 
to play. We're always trying to open up the music." The band plays at Hamptons 
in Santa Ana on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has plenty of empathy for the sideman's role: He has been there. 
Currently a member Joe Zawinul's Zawinul Syndicate, he has also played with the 
likes of Chick Corea (who, he said, "has got more rhythm in him than any 
musician I've ever met") and Jean-Luc Ponty. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great player," Henderson said of the French violinist, "but playing 
that music every night is no fun for the musicians. When someone's soloing . . 
. you have a part to play, just like a sequencer. It's so inhuman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's stupid for a band to be one person's concept only," Henderson 
continued. "It's boring for the other musicians. We're just using my name 
because I have the highest visibility right now." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, there's more than democratic ideals behind Tribal Tech. The band's 
latest album, "Nomad," on the Relativity label, is an electric excursion into 
jazz, rock and world-beat, a thick, rhythmic mix whose melodic lines echo such 
better-known bands as Corea's and Zawinul's. Henderson's title cut and another 
of his pieces called "Rituals" both could provide a perfect soundtrack for the 
record's cover art: a group of Indians sitting around a fire listening to a 
shiny, futuristic Robocop figure in a headdress. 
</P>
<P>
"The tribal part of our band isn't so much tribal but traditional," Henderson 
said. "Seeing a mix of the old and the new is a favorite thing of mine, 
something that's really romantic for me. I just went to Tokyo -- it's my 
favorite city -- and it's like that there. You see the old culture mixed in 
with just tons of neon, like that 'Blade Runner' thing." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said Zawinul's sound has had an impact on his own. But, he added: 
"I'm trying not to let him influence me too much. I don't want the band to be a 
Weather Report clone. And I don't think it ever could, because there's too much 
rock 'n' roll influence in my background." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson wasn't hearing John Coltrane and Wes Montgomery around the house 
while he was growing up. "No, man, I heard Led Zeppelin, I grew up listening to 
rock 'n' roll. I didn't even listen to jazz until I was 22 or 23 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Like a lot of guys, he admitted that when he first picked up a guitar, back in 
the 10th grade, he was trying to impress girls. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first jazz album he heard was drummer Billy Cobham's 1973 
rock-influenced "Spectrum," he quickly moved on. "I'd have to say the fusion 
thing influenced me the least, was just a steppingstone that led to straight 
ahead," he said. "The change was real fast for me. I discovered the old Miles 
Davis albums with Wayne Shorter and Tony Williams. It's still my favorite jazz 
band ever." 
</P>
<P>
He has no misconceptions about the type of music he plays. "I was talking to 
John Patitucci once on the Chick Corea tour bus," Henderson said, "and he was 
saying how he hated fusion and that he didn't want to be in a fusion band. I 
was thinking, 'Man, that's what you're in right now.' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of musicians have a real hatred of that word. You can't really blame 
them, because there are so many lame fusion bands. But I think fusion is the 
perfect word for what we do. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not straight ahead, we're not rock. We're influenced by R&amp;B and 
funk. I'm influenced heavily by (former Deep Purple guitarist) Ritchie 
Blackmore, (guitarists) Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, the cats that I grew up 
listening to. That's what fusion is, a mixing of one or more elements. But 
because we're a fusion band, it doesn't mean we're lame." 
</P>
<P>
The new band is working on an album ("Nomad" was recorded in 1988) and hopes to 
tour later this spring before Henderson goes on the road with Zawinul. 
Meanwhile, the struggle for musical liberation continues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're headed a bit more into the improvisation side of things," Henderson 
said. "We're less structured live than on the record. A lot of people aren't 
aware of what a struggle it is for a musician to maintain a balance between 
freedom and structure. It's like the guy who wants to be single and, at the 
same time, wants to be married. It's a constant battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Henderson and Tribal Tech play Monday at 8 p.m. at Hamptons, 3503 S. 
Harbor Blvd., Santa Ana. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714) 979-5511.

GRAND PIANO STILL BESTOWS GRAND STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, John Morell is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the 1820s, a New York carriage driver inherited an unexpected fortune 
from a Southern relative and found new life as a Louisiana plantation owner. In 
hopes of being accepted by local society, he commissioned Loud Brothers, a 
Philadelphia instrument maker, to build an elaborate grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
Although widely acclaimed in Europe, the grand was still a curiosity in the 
United States. The plantation owner wanted fancy wood carvings on the exterior 
and a keyboard compass of 7 1/2 octaves, one quarter more than the standard 
piano of today -- and one quarter more than was needed. 
</P>
<P>
The huge grand piano was probably never played for his society friends but it 
sure looked good. 
</P>
<P>
Some things never change. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're getting is people in their 30s and 40s buying culture," says Ian 
Davis, assistant manager of Sherman Clay's South Coast Plaza store. 
</P>
<P>
The piano salesman breaks his customers down this way: "About half of them 
don't play the piano and have no interest in playing the piano. About 25% don't 
play but want to learn or have a child learn to play, and another 25% can play. 
</P>
<P>
"But most buyers of grand pianos want to show that they have good taste. It's 
really a cultural status symbol." 
</P>
<P>
Davis' charges are hard to deny. The grand is a symbol of taste and romance. 
</P>
<P>
It's the intensity of Horowitz playing his soul out on synthetic ivory-esque 
keys. It's "As Time Goes By" echoing in Rick's Cafe. It's the sensuality of 
Michelle Pfeiffer spread out on Jeff Bridges' piano in "The Fabulous Baker 
Boys." 
</P>
<P>
But while the big grand piano may always have a place in our hearts, most of us 
don't have a place in our pocketbooks or, more importantly, our living rooms to 
accommodate such a dream piece. 
</P>
<P>
Piano manufacturers are responding to our shortcomings. "Kimball makes a very 
small grand called 'La Petite,' " Davis says. "Its dimensions are about 54 
inches by 54 inches, which makes it ideal for the small condominium or 
apartment, and it sells for around $4,000. Of course, it doesn't have the same 
sound quality of a larger grand piano, but it is a real grand piano." 
</P>
<P>
The advance of technology has meant that a piano doesn't have to be made up of 
hammers, strings and dampers. "Samick makes an all-digital baby grand that 
sounds like the real thing," says Allan Ansdell, owner of Ansdell Piano in 
Anaheim. "It has headphones so that someone who's practicing won't disturb 
others in the house, and it has a weighted key action that makes it feel like 
an acoustic piano. And if you don't want to play, it can play by itself." The 
21st-Century wonder retails for around $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
If you've made up your mind that you've got to have a grand to grace your home, 
there are some important considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you or someone in your family will be playing it, try and get the best that 
you can afford," Davis says. "Prices can range from $4,000 for the Law Petiti 
to $60,000 for a Steinway, which is the premier instrument." 
</P>
<P>
While used or rebuilt pianos can be a bargain, Davis cautions that "Most pianos 
older than 50 years are difficult to rebuild and often don't have the same 
sound as a newer instrument. While a concert violinist may use a 200-year-old 
violin, a concert pianist will use a new piano." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ansdell, whose sales of grands and baby grands have risen 27% in the 
last three years, says that good used grand pianos can be a bargain, both 
because of their sound and price, which range from $2,000 to $39,000. "We have 
a big market for old used Steinways. There were no shortages of good Sitka 
spruce at the turn of the century, and time adds mellowness to the sounding 
board which gives these older instruments a better tone." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Spillan, assistant manager of Esquire Piano in Buena Park, which 
specializes in rebuilding pianos, says that most of his customers look at price 
before quality when selecting a piano. "They want something that looks good for 
the cheapest dollar amount, which is fine if you want a piece of furniture. But 
if you're looking for a good instrument, you might want someone to take a look 
at it before buying." 
</P>
<P>
Spillan estimates that a good rebuilding and refinishing costs from $3,000 to 
$7,500, depending on what needs to be done. However, a rebuilding job should 
only be considered on an instrument that's worth the effort. "There are a lot 
of cheap pianos out there that are made poorly and don't last. But if they have 
a nice old Steinway they'd like to keep, rebuilding is probably worth the 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
"While it might look beautiful," Davis says, "a piano is only as good as it 
plays. Try and stick to the better brands. If you're looking for an investment, 
Steinways always appreciate." 
</P>
<P>
As in most other industries, the Japanese are moving in and Yamaha has 
challenged Steinway's claim as the foremost piano. "The Yamaha is famous for 
its bright tone, it records very well and it's used by many pop stars," Davis 
says. "But a hand-built Steinway is always the concert pianist's choice." 
</P>
<P>
The most popular color for a grand piano? "Nine out of 10 grands that we sell 
are black," Davis says. "Deep black lacquer." 
</P>
<P>
Just like the movies.

'LIVABLE' DREAM HOUSES; 
</P>
<P>
WITH CAREFUL PLANNING, LUXURY AND CHILDREN CAN COEXIST IN YOUR HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Imagine the house of your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
It would probably look like pictures you've seen in magazines, where everything 
is in perfect order. 
</P>
<P>
But wait. There are never any people in those pictures. Definitely never 
children with peanut butter-smeared hands aimed at coconut-white curtains. 
</P>
<P>
Before you spend a small fortune on mistakes-to-be, remember that designing 
around children requires that you consider durability and practicality. Keep 
these imperatives in mind when picking out furniture, wallpaper, paint, floor 
coverings and window treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Camouflage is an important weapon in the war against dirty footprints and 
hands. Plaids, prints or medium tones disguise stains and soiling. 
</P>
<P>
The latest trend in home design uses a monochromatic color scheme of rich, warm 
tones (like beige, taupe and blush) highlighted with darker jewel-toned 
accents. It's termed "livable luxury" by its creator Dana Eggerts, president of 
Costa Mesa-based Creative Design Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's sophisticated homeowner has kids, and their lifestyle requires a more 
functional approach," she says. "The desire to accumulate material possessions 
has taken a back seat to raising a family. Even today's top movies and 
television shows reflect this shift in values. At one time, showcase homes like 
those seen in 'Dynasty' and 'Falcon Crest' were favored. Now the popular shows 
are 'Wonder Years' and 'Growing Pains,' and films like 'The Little Mermaid' and 
'Parenthood.' 
</P>
<P>
"People still want to impress their friends with their homes, but they are also 
concerned with livability and practicality." 
</P>
<P>
Eggerts recommends the use of natural rattan furniture and faux stone floors. 
</P>
<P>
Walls seem to be magnets that draw fingerprints to them. The two most popular 
wall-covering options are wallpaper and paint. Select a wallpaper that is 
scrubbable, durable and stain-resistant, like vinyls. Tack it down securely at 
the seams; children love to pick at it when the seams start to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
Children quickly outgrow wallpaper patterns. Valinda Tivenan, who has a 
master's degree in interior designer from Cal State Long Beach and is an 
interior design instructor at Rancho Santiago College, suggests using wallpaper 
borders in children's room, and not cover the entire wall. Says Tivenan, "Not 
only is that cost effective, but it creates a line that flows around the room 
and makes proper rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
Walls also can be decorated with murals or stencils. You can design a stencil 
pattern yourself, buy stencils at a crafts store or hire a professional. 
Bulletin board material tacked to the wall can display artwork and items of 
interest to your child. 
</P>
<P>
Latex, a water-base paint, is a popular paint choice for households with 
children because it's convenient to apply and it's non-polluting, says Steve 
Davis, Sherwin Williams' district manager for Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
Of the latex products, he recommends a quality semi-gloss paint because it's 
easier to wash off and will hold up better than flat latex under repeated 
scrubbing. 
</P>
<P>
If you're set on white linoleum for the kitchen, pick one with a pattern; solid 
colors are more difficult to maintain, especially in high-traffic areas. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the hazard factor to consider when selecting your floor covering. 
Suzanne Levin Herrera, a mother of two who lives in Orange, learned about the 
dangers of tile floors when her son, Matthew, then 3 years old, fell on a tile 
step and needed five stitches on his head. 
</P>
<P>
Hardwood floors aren't any safer. "When a child is learning to walk," Herrera 
said, "hardwood floors are difficult because you usually have the (child) in a 
pair of socks. This is extremely slippery, and they fall." 
</P>
<P>
To prevent this, cover hardwood or tile floors with large area rugs. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been improvements made in stain-resistant carpets, "nothing 
is soil free," says Tivenan, "and when you clean them, the finish will come 
off." 
</P>
<P>
The interior designer recommends selecting a carpet with a pattern rather than 
relying on stain protection alone. A good color choice is one in the middle 
values -- light colors show dirt and darker colors show lint. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi McLaughlin, a Villa Park mother of three who has hunter green carpet 
throughout her house, disagrees, saying dark carpeting is worth the extra 
effort it entails. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure wasn't going to get anything light with three boys. You have to vacuum 
it a lot," she admitted, "but it never shows stains." 
</P>
<P>
To lighten the look in her house, McLaughlin had a peach-colored carpet border 
installed, which also lends a look of formality to the dining room, living room 
and stairs. "You just make sure your kids don't walk on the peach," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the new (low or medium pile) carpets that don't show the vacuum marks 
or footprints clean up a lot better," says McLaughlin, who confesses to 
vacuuming several times a week to erase footprints and collect lint. 
</P>
<P>
"High pile shows traffic marks. I recommend the 'cut and loop,' the sculpture 
look because that hides the footprints and soil," says Jay Lawrence of Linbrook 
Carpets in Anaheim. "It's very important that you buy the best padding your 
budget permits because the carpeting won't hold up as well if you have cheap 
padding, and the softer it is underneath, the less abrasion, which cuts down on 
the wear and tear." 
</P>
<P>
One way to prolong the life of your carpet is to invest in good quality 
synthetic, rubber-backed mats. This is the cheapest and easiest method of 
decreasing the amount of dirt your children bring into your home. Place them at 
all the entrances. 
</P>
<P>
For window treatments, McLaughlin used tieback curtains or shutters. She's 
satisfied with shutters because "they shut out light and are really durable." 
However, she recommends shutters where the louvers are on the top half and the 
bottom half of the shutter is a wood panel. 
</P>
<P>
"This protects the louvers from little hands that love to play with them, 
opening and shutting, opening and shutting . . . ," McLaughlin says. 
</P>
<P>
For bedrooms, use inexpensive window treatments like mini-blinds or shades 
combined with a valance or cornice at the top. Mini-blinds are relatively easy 
to clean and to control light, a consideration for napping children. 
</P>
<P>
Having a lovely home is an attainable goal in spite of the havoc children 
inflict. Taking into account their peculiarities will save you money and the 
frustration of redoing a job shortly after it's completed.

A PORTABLE CELLAR CAN PROTECT A PRIZED WINE

<P>
It was Saturday night and Gary White, an avid cook and wine collector, had 
prepared a spectacular dinner for his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Laguna Hills resident had saved a special bottle of white wine 
for the occasion, but the romantic moment when he poured it turned sour after 
just one sip. Suddenly he was out of his chair, opening another bottle, then 
another. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Each tasted like vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd just had a hot spell, and my white wine had gone bad," White recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He had lost about 24 bottles -- not to mention the glow a fine wine would have 
added to the evening with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
That was about a year ago, and White hasn't lost a bottle since. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other wine enthusiasts who start by storing bottles in the coolest 
place in the house -- usually a closet -- he decided he needed more protection 
for his prized collection. 
</P>
<P>
He discovered that manufacturers in the wine industry were a step ahead of him: 
They already had produced a variety of portable, temperature-controlled wine 
cellars for those who have outgrown the wine rack but don't have enough wine -- 
or room -- for a full-fledged cellar. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Sizemore, president of Wine Chillers of California in Santa Ana, sells 
everything from a 60-bottle cellar priced at $795 to a walk-in cabinet that 
holds more than 2,000 bottles and costs $6,595. 
</P>
<P>
He said the most popular model is one that looks like a refrigerator but 
contains a wine rack that holds 288 bottles. It sells for $1,985 and usually 
goes in the garage, though some put it in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a demand for large oak credenzas that are attractive enough to 
dress up the dining room. Sizemore sells one credenza that holds 120 bottles 
for $1,940 and another that holds 625 bottles for $3,540. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of people with large storage systems in the garage or basement 
and a credenza in the house for daily use," Sizemore said. 
</P>
<P>
Hi-Time Cellars in Costa Mesa sells portable, temperature-controlled cellars 
ranging from a capacity of 36 to 410 bottles and priced at $450 and up, and A1 
Home Appliance and TV in Santa Ana offers a variety of sizes ranging in price 
from about $500 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of their size, the portable cellars protect fine wines by keeping 
them at a constant temperature and humidity level -- 55 degrees with 70% 
humidity is ideal for aging both white and red wines, Sizemore said. 
</P>
<P>
Some credenzas also have a chilling plate that enables collectors to bring as 
many as eight bottles at a time to serving temperature (65 degrees for reds, 45 
for whites) without affecting the temperature of the wines in storage. 
</P>
<P>
Sizemore, who lost about 130 bottles of wine stored under his stairwell to 
spoilage before he discovered portable cellars, said that about 200 of his 
customers have bought as many as six different wine cellars as their 
collections have grown. They prefer buying the portable units to building their 
own cellar -- as many high-end custom homeowners are doing -- because they want 
to be able to take them along when they move, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Gary White, who owns a kitchen-design firm in Newport Beach, ended up buying 
three 65-bottle cellars with glass doors and making his own credenza by framing 
them with white plastic laminate. He spent about $3,500 on what he calls a 
"very attractive piece of furniture" for his kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
White, who said his customers increasingly ask him to include small, portable 
wine cellars in their kitchens, decided to make his own credenza because he 
wanted something contemporary rather than the traditional oak models on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he has as many as 400 bottles in his collection, but as the hot 
summer months approach, he makes sure he doesn't collect more than he can fit 
into his temperature-controlled cellars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the portable cellars on the market are miniature versions of the best 
cellars in the chateaus of France, said Michael Andrews, general manager of the 
Wine Spectator Collection, a firm based in San Francisco and New York that 
sells a variety of temperature-controlled wine cellars by catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an amazing difference between wines stored under correct conditions 
and those that are not," he said. "It's not just a matter of having a place to 
store wine under ideal conditions so that when you go to drink that special 
bottle, it hasn't turned to vinegar. You can also pick up young wines at a good 
price and keep them in the cellar to bring them to their peak." 
</P>
<P>
Although some collectors prefer to build their own cellars or rent a 
temperature-controlled locker -- Hi-Time Cellars, for example, has lockers 
starting at $130 a year for 144 bottles -- Andrews said the demand for portable 
wine cellars is growing. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd have saturated the market years ago, but it's a burgeoning 
industry still," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't surprise Ron Loutherback, owner of the Wine Club, a large 
wholesale store in Santa Ana where wine lovers can taste as well as buy. 
</P>
<P>
"Fine wine collecting is hotter than it's ever been in the 25 years I've been 
in this area," he said. "There's almost frantic buying when the most 
collectible wines are released. People take off work and rush from one store to 
another to buy them." 
</P>
<P>
Loutherback, who sells about 15 refrigerator-size cellars a month at $1,399, 
said many of his customers still keep their collection in a closet because they 
would rather spend their money on wine than storage. 
</P>
<P>
If the closet is insulated and the temperature doesn't get higher than 70 
degrees, the wine is likely to be safe -- though it probably will mature faster 
than it would in a cellar, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
But, like Gary White, many learn the hard way that closets can be risky in this 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
White doesn't plan to take any more chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm breathing easier knowing my wines aren't going to spoil," he said.

ON THE WATERFRONT: WISE BOAT PURCHASE CAN HINGE ON A SURVEYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Life.

<P>
Whether you are thinking of spending $20,000 for a weekend trailer boat, 
$100,000 for a family cruiser or a cool million for an oceangoing yacht, how do 
you make sure the vessel is worth its price tag? 
</P>
<P>
One way is to hire a marine surveyor to inspect and appraise the boat before 
you buy it. Most banks and insurance companies require a professional survey 
before they will finance or insure a used vessel. Some even require surveys of 
new boats. 
</P>
<P>
Smart buyers hire a surveyor before plopping down their life savings to buy a 
trim beauty that may turn out to be a floating lemon in disguise. Surveyors can 
help dampen the ardor of such misplaced love, saving you thousands of dollars 
and years of heartache. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a man who was paying $20,000 for a steel boat," says one marine 
surveyor, who asked not to be identified. "I took one look at the boat and it 
looked like trouble. I tapped it with my hammer and knocked a hole right 
through the hull. I told the man the boat was worthless. But he was already in 
love with the boat and he kept saying, 'But is anything really wrong with it?' 
It took me 30 minutes to explain to him all the things that were wrong with the 
boat. In the end, he decided not to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Marine surveyors -- professionals who crawl through boats, tapping on hulls, 
inspecting hoses, poking fingers into bilges -- are a misunderstood lot, 
according to Newport Beach surveyor Mike Ramey. "Most people think a marine 
survey means going out and measuring the depth of the ocean. That is not what 
it is at all." 
</P>
<P>
Marine surveyors spend hours inspecting boats to make sure they are safe and 
sound. "A survey is pretty comprehensive," says Ron Tyson, who has been 
inspecting vessels for 10 years. "We look at it from stem to stern and look at 
every system from machinery to electronics to heads. A survey is a safety 
inspection of the vessel. We are looking at the boat to make sure it complies 
with National Fire Protection Agency standards and to American Boat and 
Yachting Council standards." 
</P>
<P>
Most surveyors have a few safety horror stories to tell. For example, Ramey 
remembers walking on a live-aboard boat in Newport Beach and looking in the 
bilges. "The bilges were filled with gasoline," he says. "The fuel tanks had 
leaks in them and the people had been living on this boat and had not noticed. 
Why it never caught on fire is still a mystery to me." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for leaky fuel lines is top priority for most surveyors. A recent 
change in Coast Guard rules requires all boat owners to replace old neoprene 
fuel lines with new approved fuel lines, according to Tyson. The change was 
required because the additives in the new, unleaded gasolines can permeate the 
old hoses, resulting in dangerous fuel leaks. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, three years after the change, we are finding boats with these old 
lines," he says. "I just surveyed an old gasoline-powered boat that had the 
neoprene-type lines." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's survey report included the requirement that the boat's fuel lines be 
replaced to prevent a potential gas leak. "Gasoline in the bilge is the 
equivalent of throwing a lighted stick of dynamite down there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Other common problems encountered by surveyors include deteriorated hose clamps 
that could cause a boat to take on water and sink; improperly installed bilge 
pumps; running lights that don't work, and leaks in the exhaust system. 
</P>
<P>
"My theory is that if you don't find something wrong with the boat, then you 
are not doing your job as a surveyor," says Roby Bessent, a Long Beach surveyor 
who conducts surveying seminars for Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the safety aspect of the survey, another important part is the 
appraisal. "We go through and establish a replacement and market value," Tyson 
says. "Banks and insurance companies are interested in these before they will 
make a loan or place an insurance value on a boat." 
</P>
<P>
Surveyor Ramey says: "We arrive at an appraisal so that boats are not sold for 
way more than they are worth." 
</P>
<P>
Marine surveyors are not licensed, but most do belong to professional 
organizations such as the National Assn. of Marine Surveyors. And many, such as 
Roby Bessent, who has been surveying boats in California for 27 years, are 
licensed skippers. 
</P>
<P>
Others such as Gary Worobec of G.T.W. Marine Surveys are former boat builders. 
"A surveyor needs a good, basic, general boating background," says Worobec, who 
also worked as a diesel mechanic. "And you have to be able to write, because a 
survey is actually a story about the boat. We go through the different aspects 
of the boat and inspect it. There are a lot of people who can inspect a vessel, 
but if you can't put it down on paper, it is not of use to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Worobec suggests that, if you are looking for a reputable surveyor, you ask a 
bank or an insurance company who they use. "This is like any other professional 
business," he says. "If your phone does not ring, you are just another guy on 
the street. Good surveyors have experience and a professional clientele that 
relies on them for services." 
</P>
<P>
In the surveying profession, reputation is everything, Ramey says. "Banks, 
lending institutions and so forth do not deal with firms that are not 
reputable," he says. "Surveyors are usually people who have been in the marine 
field for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Most surveyors charge according to the length of the boat; prices range from $8 
to $11 a foot.

Odetta is a human jukebox of traditional American folk music. Her repertoire, 
both on record and in concert, ranges from 19th-Century slave songs and 
spirituals to the topical ballads of such 20th-Century folk icons as Woody 
Guthrie and Pete Seeger. 
</P>
<P>
And, although she periodically strays into other styles of music -- she's sung 
jazz, Broadway show tunes, even opera -- Odetta likes nothing better than to 
apply her rich, powerful voice and intense, evocative singing style to 
traditional American folk music -- the music that made us think, then made us 
act, in times past. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always asking me, 'Why don't you do more modern songs?' And I guess 
it's because I'm an ancestor worshiper and a historian," said Odetta, who will 
appear Saturday night at the Del Mar Shores Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the music that turned my life around, and I feel a need to continue 
that music so that more and more people can hear it -- and hear messages from 
those who have gone before us, hear how our ancestors got us through to better 
positions than they were in." 
</P>
<P>
History, after all, has a way of repeating itself, she said, and the message 
contained in these vintage tunes is as relevant today as when they were 
written. 
</P>
<P>
"We in this country are terribly confused," Odetta said. "I'm not sure we know 
exactly how we're confused, but there is something amiss with millions of 
dollars being shipped into other countries to kill civilians, and then there's 
not enough money to continue providing medicine for the elderly, who have 
worked all their lives and contributed to this country's welfare and should be 
receiving dividends, or for working people and their children. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of stuff that just doesn't compute, and I think people need to 
be assuaged, to be soothed, by knowing they're not the only ones feeling like 
there's something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The words to traditional folk songs were written out of concern, and there's 
as much to be concerned about now as there ever was." 
</P>
<P>
Odetta, who turned 59 Dec. 31, was born in Birmingham, Ala. She lost her father 
when she was 6, and later moved to Los Angeles with her mother, sister and 
stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
There she sang in her junior high school glee club and began taking private 
voice lessons. She later worked as an amateur at the Turnabout Theater in 
Hollywood and studied music at Los Angeles City College. In 1949, she won a 
part in the chorus of the touring musical production of "Finian's Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, the musical hit San Francisco for an extended stay, Odetta 
recalled, and it was there -- in the coffeehouses she frequented after the 
shows -- that she discovered folk music. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in my life, I heard the music of the people I came from," 
she said. "One of the things we read in our history books, when I was in 
grammar school, was that the slaves were singing all the time because they were 
happy, but the songs I heard debunked that theory. 
</P>
<P>
"And hearing this music made me feel proud. I straightened my back and kinked 
my hair, and from that point on I was determined to learn all there was to 
learn, not just about my black heritage, but about my American heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Odetta promptly left the "Finian's" chorus line and ventured out on her own. 
She made her debut as a solo folk singer in San Francisco's Hungry i, earning 
$25 a night; she subsequently hit the road, singing in folk clubs and 
coffeehouses up and down the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1950s, Odetta was touring nationwide and in Canada; she cut her 
first record, for San Francisco's Tradition label, in 1956. With the advent of 
the folk revival, she began getting plenty of national attention. 
</P>
<P>
Odetta performed at the Newport Folk Festival in 1959, 1960, 1964 and 1965 and 
released several albums on Vanguard Records, the home of fellow folkies such as 
Joan Baez, Doc Watson and the Jim Kweskin Jug Band. 
</P>
<P>
Odetta has since toured Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies 
and Northwest Africa and has recorded for independent folk labels. She's also 
made countless television appearances and popped up in several films -- 
including "Sanctuary" and the TV movie "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman" 
-- in both singing and dramatic roles. 
</P>
<P>
She said she plans to continue doing plenty of benefit work for social and 
environmental organizations and causes, something she's always been known for. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to do that. I need to put something back into the pot; I need to be 
helpful and useful to those who are on the firing line with their energies 
focusing on areas that will improve the lives of more people in this country."

James P. O'Donnell, a former European correspondent and editor who wrote a 
best-selling book on Adolf Hitler's final days, has died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell, a professor at Boston University and former writer for Newsweek and 
the Saturday Evening Post, was 72. He died Monday at a Boston hospital. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell, who wrote hundreds of articles on Europe, North Africa and the 
Middle East, met Hitler on several occasions while a student in Germany. He 
also met or interviewed Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Charles 
de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
He covered the Nuremburg war crimes trial and the Berlin airlift as Berlin 
bureau chief for Newsweek from 1945 until 1948. 
</P>
<P>
After his release from the Army in July, 1945, Newsweek had sent him to Berlin 
to write about Hitler's bunker, where he found written materials ranging from 
loose-leaf notebooks and files to diaries and appointment books. 
</P>
<P>
"At least five Red Army search teams had been in the bunker the day it fell," 
he later wrote after gaining access to the bunker by giving a Russian guard a 
pack of cigarettes. "They had been looking for only one thing, the body." 
</P>
<P>
He was a Paris correspondent for New York's Daily News from 1949 to 1950. For 
the next decade, he was contributing editor and associate editor for Europe for 
the Saturday Evening Post. 
</P>
<P>
His book about Hitler, "The Bunker," was a best-seller in 1978. It was 
published in 48 countries and was a History Book Club selection. 
</P>
<P>
A boyhood friend of the Kennedy clan, he worked on John F. Kennedy's successful 
1960 presidential campaign, and later advised him on Berlin and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell was working on his second book about Hitler, to be titled "The Hitler 
Court," when he died. 
</P>
<P>
He was a 1939 graduate of Harvard University, and received a master's degree in 
modern European history there a year later.

In eight years, Wynetka Ann Reynolds never settled comfortably into her job as

</P>
<P>
She squeaked into the position in 1982, winning on a split vote, after several 
of the top contenders withdrew. And she has faced challenges several times from 
trustees and university presidents who said her manner was imperious and her 
administration weak. 
</P>
<P>
She was even accused of contributing to the death of the embattled president of 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, Richard Butwell, when he had a heart attack two 
weeks after a blistering session with her, during which she blamed him for 
problems on the campus and told him to find another job. 
</P>
<P>
But while the controversy over her style sometimes overshadowed the substance 
of her leadership, even her critics acknowledge she helped make improvements 
that moved the massive university system ahead on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Admission standards were raised in the Cal State system, which had 365,000 
students in 1988-89. Teacher education improved. Minority and women faculty, 
staff and students raised their profile on campus as the result of special 
recruitment. Campus building resumed after a lull of several years. The status 
of fine arts programs grew. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds cited those achievements and others as she tendered her resignation as 
chancellor Friday after the board rescinded her secretly arranged salary hike 
that boosted her income by more than $58,000 over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the accomplishments during my tenure," she told the trustees. 
"I've treasured working on these goals." 
</P>
<P>
She will leave her post in October, and her resignation will be effective at 
year's end. The daughter of a college president, Reynolds, 52, graduated from 
Kansas State Teachers' College in Emporia in 1958 and earned her masters and 
doctorate degrees in zoology from the University of Iowa in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
She began teaching at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., in 1962 and three 
years later moved to the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago, 
where she taught and conducted research in developmental biology and 
embryology. 
</P>
<P>
It was through her medical research that she felt she earned her stripes in 
academia. "If you're quick on your feet and you can handle biting monkey heads 
and don't get upset by blood and gore, then you're accepted," she once told a 
reporter. Her hands bear scars from the bites of monkeys used in her research. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Reynolds followed her father's example and moved into academic 
administration as vice chancellor for research and dean of the Graduate College 
at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Her rise through administrative ranks was swift. After just two years in the 
Illinois post, she became provost -- second in command -- at the 50,000-student 
Ohio State University in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 she was picked to head the California State University system, the 
largest higher education network in the nation. The move was considered by many 
to be too big a leap for someone with only five years of administrative 
experience and none of that in a college's top spot. 
</P>
<P>
But Reynolds dismissed that argument and expressed confidence that she could do 
the job. "The notion that you can do a job only if you've done it before just 
doesn't make any sense," she said in a 1982 interview. 
</P>
<P>
She moved into the chancellor's residence in Bel-Air with her two young 
children -- she had been divorced years earlier -- and later married Dr. Thomas 
Kirschbaum, a USC medical professor. 
</P>
<P>
At Ohio State she had earned the nickname "Queen Ann" for what some called her 
abrupt, often insensitive management style. That reputation persisted in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Her supporters found her charming and warm, but she could turn icy and cutting 
when crossed. She was known for publicly upbraiding her subordinates, and 
detractors said she reacted so personally to criticism that controversy swirled 
unnecessarily around her. 
</P>
<P>
But they also acknowledge that she is intelligent and hard working and was 
committed to elevating the status of California's second-tier of higher 
education.
