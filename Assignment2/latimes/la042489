The latest round of stalled U.N.-mediated Persian Gulf peace talks in Geneva 
between Iran and Iraq ended without any progress or a firm date for their 
resumption, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar reported. He said 
his special representative, Sweden's U.N. ambassador, Jan Eliasson, will be in 
touch with both sides in New York to "prepare for a possible meting in June." 
The two sides blame each other for the continuing deadlock over the issue of 
withdrawing troops to recognized borders. The two sides disagree over where the 
border lies. Fighting stopped when a cease-fire went into effect last Aug. 20.

Siberia and Alaska officials were forced by fog and blowing snow to resort to 
telephone diplomacy in their efforts to win approval for regular visits between 
the countries by Eskimos. Gov. Steve Cowper and the Alaska delegation were 
grounded in Nome, so he used a radio-telephone hookup to communicate with his 
counterpart from the Magadan region of the Soviet Far East, Vyacheslav I. 
Kobets. Kobets was on the ice pack at the international date line between the 
Diomede islands. A largely symbolic protocol signed by Cowper calls for a 
commission to oversee travel between the countries.

Islamic militants in Sudan attacked a Roman Catholic center for the destitute 
and dying, injuring a nun and three other people, a Khartoum newspaper 
reported. The newspaper Sudani said the Muslims left a mosque Friday after a 
clergyman criticized the presence of the church-run relief center and attacked 
the hospice in Omdurman, twin city of Khartoum. It said the militants reacted 
after the government refused to impose strict Islamic sharia law on the 
country. The next day, the paper said, a group of Christians retaliated with an 
arson attack against mosque.

Record cold air chilled the Northeast and Great Lakes, with the mercury 
plunging below freezing, but temperatures soared into the 90s as a stretch of 
summer weather lingered over the plains. Unseasonably cold temperatures 
stretched from New Jersey to Michigan, the National Weather Service said. 
Cities setting or tying record daily lows included Alpena, Mich., (18); 
Atlantic City, N.J., (24); Erie, Pa., (27); Hartford, Conn., (26), and 
Rochester, N.Y., (24). Meanwhile, among the record highs set or tied: Amarillo,

Led by Lech Walesa, members of Poland's Solidarity trade union and allied 
opposition groups approved 252 independent candidates for national legislative 
elections Walesa, Solidarity's leader, declined to run. The 252 candidates, by 
receiving the endorsement of the Solidarity Citizens Committee, are now 
eligible to run for a new 100-member senate or for the 161 available opposition 
seats in the existing 460-member upper house known as the Sejm, or Parliament. 
Candidates for the nine remaining seats open to the opposition will be selected 
in the next few days, a Solidarity spokesman said. The elections, a result of 
round-table talks between the government and the opposition, will be the most 
democratic elections in Poland's postwar history.

Marin County's image may be that of steaming hot tubs and youthful hedonists 
gamboling in paradise, but over the next decade residents may be thinking more 
about Medicare than child care. After the year 2000, the county will have the 
oldest population in the state. The graying of Marin will be the focus of 
research about the aging process and a Ponce de Leon-like attempt to "arrest 
the downside of getting old." According to a report by the county's Agency on 
Aging, Marin's population of those 60 and older will increase about 48% by the 
turn of the century.

ANAHEIM SPRINKLER LAWS FOR NEW HOMES IGNITE DEBATE OVER COST, SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Anaheim last week became one of the few cities in the country to require 
sprinklers in all new homes, it took sides in a growing nationwide debate over 
whether sprinklers save thousands of lives or simply add thousands of dollars 
to the price of every new house. 
</P>
<P>
The emerging battle over mandatory fire sprinklers pits two familiar foes 
against each other: firefighters who argue that the devices can prevent deaths 
and millions of dollars in losses, and building industry officials who say 
those claims are exaggerated and that the price of sprinklers -- about $2,000 
per home -- will further discourage home buyers in an already expensive market. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 communities in the United States now require sprinklers for 
single-family homes, apartments and condominiums, contrasted with only half a 
dozen in 1981, according to Operation Life Safety in Washington, an affiliate 
of the International Assn. of Fire Chiefs. Orange County led the country in 
1980, when San Clemente became the first city to require sprinklers in new 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an encouraging thing that has started to spread," said Harvey Seymour, 
spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. "Up until now, the best 
ammunition was smoke detectors. But nothing works as well as sprinklers." 
</P>
<P>
Smoke detectors, now installed in three-fourths of America's homes, are 
credited with saving up to 1,000 lives a year, according to the Insurance 
Information Institute in New York City. Sprinklers can save more lives, 
firefighters say. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 report by the National Bureau of Standards estimated that adding 
sprinklers to one- and two-family homes could reduce fire deaths by as much as 
60% to 70% a year, "a savings of about 2,500 lives a year." 
</P>
<P>
Of 55 fires involving residential sprinkler systems studied by Life Safety 
since 1986, the devices saved 44 lives and millions of dollars in property, 
said director Jim Dalton. "And there has never been a multiple loss of life in 
a fully sprinkled building," Dalton added. 
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, Cobb County Fire Chief David Hilton credits a 1981 ordinance with 
saving at least 18 lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Less Than 1% of Homes 
</P>
<P>
Yet because sprinklers exist in less than 1% of American homes, reliable data 
about them is scarce and often incomplete. Most of the information is 
anecdotal, as in a recent Napa, Calif., fire in which a sprinkler extinguished 
flames on a baby's quilt and saved the child, said Orange County Fire Capt. 
Hank Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
But laws requiring the sprinkler systems will not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a serious affordable-housing problem," said John Withers, spokesman 
for the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern 
California. "To rush ahead and require sprinklers on a mandatory basis is 
ill-advised, given the tremendous costs involved and the marginal benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Opposing mandatory sprinklers can be about as popular as opposing apple pie and 
baseball, builders battling the ordinances concede. But they say consumers 
don't want sprinklers, that the systems cost too much when home prices are 
already steep, and that insurance savings and safety claims by sprinkler 
proponents are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"Houses today are safer than they have ever been," Withers said. "Virtually all 
fire fatalities are in structures more than 20 years old. If you want to be 
totally safe, let's go back to adobe huts. How far do you go, and at what 
cost?" 
</P>
<P>
And building industry officials contend that sprinkler systems may not be as 
reliable as proponents maintain. Mechanical problems, human error and tampering 
may cause them to fail. Withers said sprinklers can malfunction. He cited the 
system that flooded a Los Alamitos warehouse when the 1987 Whittier earthquake 
shook the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned With Liability 
</P>
<P>
Withers said his concern is liability. He wonders who would be accountable if 
the system fails in a fire: builders, the subcontractors that install the 
systems, or the sprinkler's manufacturer? 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkler technology, itself, is simple. Each sprinkler head, typically 
installed in the ceiling, is soldered to hold back the water until it is 
needed. When there is a fire, heat melts the solder on the head and releases 
the water automatically. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente Fire Department says that only five sprinkler heads have 
failed since 1980 in the 6,000 residential units in which the systems are 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond, of the Orange County Fire Department, said he has heard complaints 
from homeowners that the sprinklers keep running after being triggered, 
flooding a room. 
</P>
<P>
But the damage is usually confined to one room because a single sprinkler head 
usually contains a fire there, he said. Rarely are two heads triggered. And 
sprinklers extinguish the fire 97% of the time before firefighters arrive, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Quick-response sprinklers release from 13 to 25 gallons of water a minute," 
Raymond said. "Compare that to the 125 to 250 gallons a minute from a 
firefighter's hose, and you're looking at a dramatic difference in water 
damage."

IS COUNCIL MOVING INTO A GRAY AREA BY CLOSING DOORS?; 
</P>
<P>
SOME BELIEVE ITS PRIVATE MEETINGS VIOLATE THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Council members, meeting in closed session to discuss strategy 
for upcoming legal battles, have in the past four months made several major 
decisions in private. 
</P>
<P>
According to several legal experts contacted by The Times, those actions raise 
troubling questions about the degree to which the council is formulating public 
policy out of view of the public. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, those meetings may not have been legal under strict state laws 
written to ensure that almost all public policy questions are debated before 
the public, according to some of the experts. 
</P>
<P>
In recent secret sessions attributed to the need for attorney-client 
deliberations, the council has canceled the Air/Space America show and reviewed 
cost estimates for its multibillion-dollar sewage-treatment project. 
</P>
<P>
The council also refuses to reveal how it will spend $500,000 in public funds 
appropriated -- in closed session -- to thwart the merger of San Diego Gas 
&amp; Electric and Southern California Edison companies. That closed session 
was one of seven held on the merger during the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Ron Johnson, who approves the council's closed-session 
agendas, defended the discussions on the grounds that each one was directly 
related to council strategy sessions regarding "pending" or "potential" 
litigation -- an exemption to open meeting laws authorized in state law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Raises Our Eyebrows' 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and others also noted that in some instances the results of the private 
discussions were quickly released to the public or were leaked to a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Nelson, executive director of the San Diego Taxpayers Assn., said that 
"it concerns me if the interpretation (of the law) errs on the side of closing 
the door instead of opening the door. That's where it raises our eyebrows." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who attended an April 12 public session of council's Rules Committee 
devoted to the merger, said that he believes the council owes the public an 
explanation of why so much of the discussion was postponed for later, private 
deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really got a sense of what was going to be discussed and why it should 
be protected by pending or potential litigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three open-meeting experts contacted by the Times said that some or all of the 
council actions may have exceeded limits on closed sessions imposed by 1987 
amendments to the state's open-meeting laws and pending litigation exemptions 
in the state's public records act. The open-meeting laws allow private 
attorney-client deliberations only if public debate would hurt the council's 
position in an upcoming legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the experts said, the law requires a strict separation of legal 
strategizing and public policy making. While the council may discuss legal 
maneuvers in private, it must halt its deliberations and return to an open 
forum to discuss public policy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The pending litigation exception is probably the single most used way that 
organizations generally try to get around the Brown Act," which is the state's 
freedom of information legislation, said John Allcock, a San Diego attorney who 
frequently represents newspapers in right-to-know cases. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not allowed to go into closed session simply because your attorney 
wants to discuss a legal matter with you," said Robert Fellmeth, director of 
the Center for Public Interest Law at the University of San Diego Law School, 
who helped author the 1987 open-meeting law amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Because the new amendments took effect just last year, they have not been 
directly tested in court and are open to interpretation by attorneys advising 
municipalities. Nevertheless, at least one city council member is concerned 
that the council has on occasion exceeded its authority and believes some of 
the decisions should have been made in public. 
</P>
<P>
"The conversation starts in legitimate fashion and then it crosses over (the 
line) almost without anybody's consciousness," said the council member, who 
insisted on anonymity in discussing closed-session items. "I think the lawyers 
ought to jump in there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Careful, Mayor Says 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Maureen O'Connor said that in private sessions the council is "very 
careful" not to stray into policy questions that should be discussed publicly. 
"The attorneys sit in there and they advise us. We're very careful about what 
we say," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson explained that much of the discussion of the items in question centers 
on frank legal advice that he and other attorneys offer the council, including 
the weaknesses of the city's own arguments and the strengths of their 
opponents' cases. To debate such subjects in public would put the city at a 
distinct disadvantage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts said that the closed sessions are necessary because 
large sums of taxpayer money could be jeopardized if the council follows a 
losing legal strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"The implications for the taxpayers of this city are tremendous," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been accused of running afoul of the Brown Act more than once 
in the past decade. In 1979, a Superior Court judge ruled that six council 
members had reached an illegal collective decision in private when they signed 
a memo urging City Manager Ray Blair to reverse a council decision. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Tribune newspaper sued the council alleging that it had reached a 
consensus on the 1986-87 budget in private and then held a "sham" public 
meeting to approve the $644-million spending blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the council may have strayed over the open-meeting boundaries in its 
Feb. 7 closed session vote to revoke Air/Space America's permit to host a 1990 
aerial extravaganza at Brown Field and to withdraw $300,000 in city support for 
the show. The council went into closed session to discuss legal claims against 
the city from contractors who were not paid when the 1988 Air/Space America 
show ran more than $4.2 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Pressured for a decision on the 1990 show but lacking confidence in Air/Space 
America's management, the council voted to cancel the show. Councilman Bruce 
Henderson announced the decision at a council committee meeting the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the city's attorney, noted that the discussion concerned the 
possibility that the subcontractors might try to obtain some of the $300,000 
payment. He said the cancellation was an outgrowth of those talks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Step Over the Line? 
</P>
<P>
The council "could have stopped . . . and gone back into open session and, 
without discussing the other aspects of the other decision, made a decision to 
cancel the whole thing," Johnson conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in a while, it gets a little close (to the line)," he added. "This may be 
one example when it did get a little close. But I don't think it stepped over 
it." 
</P>
<P>
However, Terry Francke, counsel to the California Newspaper Publishers Assn., 
believes that the council overstepped its bounds by allowing its discussion to 
continue to the point of a decision to cancel the show. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not what might be relevant to some kind of existing or threatened 
litigation, but what, if discussed publicly, would be prejudicial to the 
agency's position," he said. "I don't see why (the cancellation discussion) 
would be (prejudicial)." 
</P>
<P>
Fellmeth, noting that the council publicly decided to schedule the air show, 
said that "a public matter decided in public should not then be reversed by a 
private meeting simply because there may be litigation involved." 
</P>
<P>
A reconsideration of the cancellation, held April 10, was conducted publicly. 
Another public session is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb 21, and again on March 20, the council received presentations from city 
staff members on the estimated cost of its massive project to upgrade its 
sewage treatment system. The price of the upgrade, estimated at $2.4 billion to 
$4.2 billion, makes the plan the biggest single public works project in city 
history. Sewer bills are expected to double as a result. 
</P>
<P>
The cost estimates were published by The Times on Feb. 23, but they were not 
formally released to the public until March 23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discussion Called Valid 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, Roberts and O'Connor said that the discussion was justified as part of 
the council's settlement negotiations with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, the U.S. Justice Department and the Regional Water Quality Control 
Board, all of which sued the city last July to force the sewage treatment 
upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
The major issues in the legal battle are the EPA's insistence that the city 
install the system earlier than the city believes is possible and how the 
project will be funded. Johnson said that the council could not discuss 
construction timing without discussing prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We are negotiating with the federal government," Roberts said. "We're 
negotiating over the costs and we're negotiating over the timing." 
</P>
<P>
Fellmeth said that the key question in this issue is the focus of the council 
discussions -- how much time was devoted to prices instead of legal tactics. Of 
course, the public and media have no access to that information because the 
sessions were held privately. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they might have a problem if (price) is the focus of the discussion," 
he said. "The focus of the discussion has to be legal tactics, offers -- 
something that if disclosed would prejudice their position." 
</P>
<P>
Fellmeth also said that the subsequent public disclosure of the prices weakens 
the city argument that it was necessary to initially hold a closed-door 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the city's attorney, also defended the closed-door discussions on the 
grounds that no final decisions were made and that the price estimates were in 
"draft" form. But Francke said that the Brown and Public Records acts offer no 
protections on those grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E Discussions 
</P>
<P>
Since Dec. 12, the council has held seven closed-door discussions on its 
strategy for thwarting the SDG&amp;E-SCE merger. The council and its private 
attorneys will be active in regulatory proceedings before the state Public 
Utilities Commission, the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 7 private session, the council voted to spend $500,000 "for the 
purpose of defraying expenses in matters related to the SCE-SDG&amp;E proposed 
merger." Though it immediately disclosed the vote, the council refuses to 
itemize how the money will be spent, on the grounds that such information would 
give SDG&amp;E an advantage in the legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"If SDG&amp;E knows my budget for outside help on this is $100,000, then by 
sitting down and looking at the case, they know whether I can do a Cadillac 
job, or a Chevy job or a pushcart job," said Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network and 
an ally of the city's in the merger battle, agreed with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I think at this point they'd be ill-advised to do it because they'd 
tip their hand to SDG&amp;E," Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Fellmeth said that the city may be justified in concealing the details of 
the spending because revealing them might have a "tactical consequence," but 
added that the city must reveal the precise expenditures once the money is 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
But Francke was highly critical of the decision, which he said violates the 
public's right to know how its tax dollars are being spent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Information-Control Mentality' 
</P>
<P>
"That's an example of the kind of information-control mentality that can take 
over when you have people who are persuaded that secrecy is the answer to 
everything," Francke said. 
</P>
<P>
"The adversary assumes that you will spend what it takes to win in a case that 
you can't afford to lose," he said. "It's just absurd to keep the wraps on that 
kind of expenditure commitment." 
</P>
<P>
And Nelson, of the taxpayers' association, said that "to the extent they're 
pulling money from the General Fund for an issue that is as visible as the 
merger and municipalization is, all efforts should be made to explain where 
this money is being spent." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that he would disclose how the funds are being spent when payments 
are made to lawyers, expert witnesses or others. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E officials declined to comment on the city decision. Steve Wall, a 
private attorney hired by SDG&amp;E to oppose the County Water Authority's plan 
to study a government takeover of the utility, said that the city decision 
leaves him with less information than he would like. 
</P>
<P>
"All you've got is a number. You don't know what it's for. I don't know if . . 
. it's going to be paid over to the water authority for the municipalization. 
There's no agenda item documents. There's no staff report. There's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who has become increasingly antagonistic toward the two utilities, 
had little sympathy for that line of argument. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxpayers know a lot more of what we're doing than the ratepayers know 
about what (SCEcorp chairman) Howard Allen is doing with their money," she 
said. "They can make their decisions in private and threaten lawsuits all over 
the place."

DREAM OF SPORTS PALACE IS A LONG WAY FROM REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he unveiled his dream of building a sports palace in San Diego several 
months ago, La Jolla millionaire Harry Cooper summarized the blend of gung-ho 
enthusiasm and sober business acumen with which he approached the project by 
saying, "This is not an easy thing we're talking of doing." 
</P>
<P>
The intervening weeks have done nothing to dissuade Cooper of that notion. 
Indeed, despite making progress on a number of fronts since he announced in 
February that he planned to take over the San Diego Sports Arena lease, the 
obstacles that confront Cooper appear just as formidable -- and, from some 
perspectives, perhaps more daunting -- as they did at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Cooper finds himself facing a City Council that has grown skeptical of 
his commitment to build the arena downtown, where the price tag could be $20 
million more than the estimated $120 million it would cost to construct it on 
his Sorrento Valley property. Moreover, even if Cooper and the city agree on a 
downtown site, his expectation that the city will cover that price differential 
could be an additional stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lukewarm 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who could play a pivotal role in 
those negotiations, has, at best, a lukewarm attitude toward Cooper's proposal 
to build a palatial 22,900-seat sports complex to replace the 23-year-old, 
much-maligned Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, all Mr. Cooper is doing is buying a lease to operate 
a sports arena as is, where is, with no commitments from the city on anything 
else," O'Connor said in a recent interview. "Later, if you're going to take a 
look at building a sports arena downtown, that may be a possibility. But we're 
nowhere near that." 
</P>
<P>
Even as Cooper goes about the difficult task of trying to secure development 
rights for an eight-square-block downtown parcel, city planners and others have 
expressed reservations about, as Horton Plaza developer Ernest Hahn put it, 
"simply dropping a sports arena complex" into downtown. Doing so, some warn, 
could seriously undermine plans for future downtown housing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the major purpose behind building a new arena -- attracting a 
professional basketball or hockey franchise to San Diego -- still faces tough 
odds. Though Cooper has lined up an unidentified potential basketball owner, 
the prospect of luring a National Basketball Assn. or National Hockey League 
team here is hardly a slam-dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aggressively pursuing those possibilities," Cooper said. "But so are a 
number of other cities." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA has awarded two new franchises to Orlando and Minneapolis for next 
year, but neither that league nor the NHL has any current plans for further 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Changing Project 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, the arena project itself has also undergone dramatic 
transformation. For economic and aesthetic reasons, the project has been 
expanded to include a 400-room hotel, a 13-story office building and 150 
condominiums, with the surrounding development intended to provide a buffer 
between the arena and its immediate environs. 
</P>
<P>
When, or if, the overall project is completed, Cooper and his partner, Richard 
Esquinas, may own only a small percentage of it, with most of the equity having 
been sold to other investors. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when asked whether that array 
</P>
<P>
of obstacles and changes in direction bothers him, Cooper simply smiled and 
said, "I end each day feeling a little more positive than the day before." 
</P>
<P>
The problems that have been encountered are typical of any project of equal 
scope, Cooper said. While admitting to occasional frustration "over things not 
falling into place as quickly as I'd like," the 56-year-old computer technology 
innovator said he keeps things in perspective by reminding himself of both the 
magnitude of his undertaking and the incremental progress that has been made. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a one-week or one-month or even one-year deal," he said. "This is a 
very big project, and we've got to overcome a lot of odds. We never deceived 
ourselves about this being quick and simple. But I think even people at City 
Hall would admit that probably more has happened in the past two months on this 
than any other project its size." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memories of Past Plans 
</P>
<P>
Within City Hall, enthusiasm over Cooper's proposal is tempered as much by 
recognition of the thorny problems remaining as by memories of similar past 
plans that never got off the drawing boards. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting that cautious attitude, O'Connor clearly remains to be sold on the 
proposal. Her ultimate decision will be crucial, because, as mayor, she could 
expedite the project by championing it or delaying -- and perhaps even 
scuttling -- it with her doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of priorities, I certainly don't see this being near the top of the 
city's list," O'Connor said. "When I need $55 million for two police officers 
per 1,000 (population) and things like the ($2-billion-plus) sewage issue are 
coming up, . . . there's no reason to turn City Hall upside down for this 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said all along: Buy the lease and run the Sports Arena if you want to. 
But what we, the council, may do in the future about a new arena should not be 
contingent upon that deal. We don't have to do anything but leave the Sports 
Arena where it is right now. That's the cheapest and easiest option. Then, in 
20 years, we'll figure out what we're going to do from there." 
</P>
<P>
Though Cooper realizes the importance of gaining the mayor's enthusiastic 
backing, he professes to be unperturbed by O'Connor's wait-and-see attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame her for feeling that way," he said. "We've still got a lot to 
do, and it's natural to have some questions. When our package is complete, I 
think those doubts will be gone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Package Would Be 'Ideal' 
</P>
<P>
The Cooper-Esquinas purchase of the existing arena lease from the Canadian 
company that now holds it probably will not be final until June, Cooper said. 
Although he said the lease sale "is not contingent on any guarantees for a new 
arena," he added: "It is all kind of tied together. It would be ideal if the 
whole package came together at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's position notwithstanding, other city officials are enthused by the 
possibility of a new arena -- particularly one built entirely or at least 
largely with private funds. They differ, however, on key questions such as 
possible sites or whether any public dollars should be involved. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts, whose district includes the current Sports Arena and 
who promoted the idea of a downtown replacement in his 1987 campaign, says 
flatly that downtown is the only location he is willing to support for this or 
any other arena proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel strongly that a sports arena is the kind of civic facility that belongs 
downtown," Roberts said. "If this group can't make that happen, I'd rather wait 
five years for one that could." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Councilman Bob Filner, who represents downtown, said he has not 
yet decided whether a site there or in a suburban area would be preferable. 
Similarly, City Architect Mike Stepner noted that the council "won't know what 
the complete balance sheet on that question looks like" until economic and 
design studies now under way are finished later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Clearer Picture 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who has spent more than $150,000 over the past two months researching 
possible sites, hopes to have that question resolved by mid-June, when an 
accounting firm's comparison of downtown and Sorrento Valley construction costs 
will be completed. With preliminary architectural work already in progress, 
Cooper said that his "absolute drop-dead deadline" for a site decision is Sept. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
"By then, the architect just can't dance anymore," said Cooper, who hopes to 
break ground on the project by June, 1990. "Now, we're doing interior design 
work common to either site. But by September, we'd have to start getting into 
more precise exterior things related to a specific site." 
</P>
<P>
Based on a tentative analysis, Cooper estimates a downtown arena would cost at 
least $20 million more as a result of higher costs for land, underground 
parking and construction logistics. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of a downtown arena argue that it would be a catalyst for development 
in the so-called Centre City East area, would be a major boon for downtown's 
night life and could be used in conjunction with the bayfront convention center 
for "video conferences" too large for the center alone. 
</P>
<P>
Potential traffic problems would be eased by the multiple freeways, San Diego 
trolley lines and numerous bus routes that feed into downtown, as well as by 
the fact that downtown workers could simply walk or take shuttles to the arena. 
The arena's proposed 5,800-car parking garage, they add, also would provide 
badly needed daytime parking for downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lining Up the Land 
</P>
<P>
Other than cost, the chief disadvantage to a downtown site stems from possible 
land-acquisition difficulties that could delay construction. Even a single 
recalcitrant landowner could force Cooper to rely upon the city's condemnation 
powers, a potentially lengthy process that could jeopardize his 1992 target 
opening date. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's first choice for a downtown site -- the San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
Co.'s maintenance yard at 10th and Imperial avenues -- appears unobtainable, 
given the utility executives' insistence that the 11.3-acre site is not for 
sale. But Cooper is still interested in that area and has begun signing 
development option contracts on the eight blocks to the north, east and west of 
the SDG&amp;E property. 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to give remaining property owners bargaining leverage, Cooper 
declined to specify the number of blocks he has acquired options on or the 
cost. However, he ruefully conceded that publicity over the arena proposal has 
dramatically driven up those prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had quietly bought up that land a year ago," he said. "I probably 
could have gotten it for a half or third what it's going to cost now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing or an Arena? 
</P>
<P>
While many city officials view a downtown arena as having the potential to spur 
the next major wave of redevelopment, others are worried that it could disrupt 
other key facets of long-range downtown planning -- especially the residential 
development envisioned for the areas being studied as possible arena locations. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, you have to ask whether housing or an arena is more important 
to the future of downtown," Filner said. "It may not be an either-or situation. 
But if it turns out that building an arena there would mean putting aside our 
plans for more downtown housing, I'm not sure we'd want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Underlining that point, architect Stepner noted in a recent memo that an arena, 
combined with a planned new civic center on downtown's eastern fringe, could 
"polarize Centre City East," resulting in "a blighted, difficult-to-develop 
area in between the two projects." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, that memo -- as well as a letter to O'Connor from developer Hahn 
that raises many of the same concerns -- concludes that, with proper planning, 
an arena could complement residential and commercial development in adjacent 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Because Cooper originally proposed building the arena on his 38-acre parcel in 
Sorrento Valley's Golden Triangle region, some city leaders question whether he 
still has an emotional attachment to that idea that could color the feasibility 
studies' conclusions. That skepticism stems in part from Cooper's frequent 
suggestions that use of his own land -- which he bought for $400,000 and that 
now is valued at more than $23 million -- likely would cut the arena's costs 
and expedite its construction. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that their interest in downtown may not be sufficient to get the 
job done," Roberts said. "I haven't seen a real aggressive push in that 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Another top city official added: "The only reason they're looking downtown is 
because we told them to. I think they'd be happy to find all kinds of reasons 
not to do it downtown." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Strong Preference' 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, however, insists that he will not make up his mind on a site -- a 
decision that requires the council's approval -- until he sees the analysis of 
the costs and other factors associated with either a downtown or Sorrento 
Valley locale. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have a strong preference now," he said. "I did in the 
beginning, but now I just want the best site, wherever that is. I'll start 
talking about downtown and get sold on it, then the next day I'll think about 
Sorrento Hills and get excited about it all over again. I've told the people 
doing the report not to slant it based on how they think I'm leaning. I just 
want to let the chips fall as they may." 
</P>
<P>
Far from needing the arena project to develop his Sorrento Valley property, 
Cooper confidently noted: "That land will be developed, with or without the 
arena. In fact, it's probably to my advantage not to build the arena there, 
because that would be riskier than other kinds of developments. I can reduce my 
risks by keeping my land separate from the arena project." 
</P>
<P>
When the site feasibility report is completed, Cooper said, he hopes it will 
show that one site has a decisive advantage over the other -- partly to 
eliminate any second-guessing on his part, but more importantly to speed the 
council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the final numbers and other factors make the choice so obvious that 
there's no real question. The worst thing would be for it to be a close call. 
But I don't think it will be." 
</P>
<P>
The projected price tags -- in particular, whether public financing would be 
required under either option -- obviously will figure prominently in that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
If, despite higher costs, the city insists on a downtown site, Cooper has 
indicated he would expect the city to pay for the difference. Although Cooper 
stressed that point from the very beginning, the growing perception that public 
financing would be a necessity for any downtown arena disturbs some city 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that was so attractive at the beginning was that this was going to 
be an entirely private project," said one council member, who asked not to be 
identified. "But now there's all this talk of public funds maybe being needed. 
. . . I don't think it's so much a question of bait-and-switch as it is an 
attempt to deliberately lead us away from downtown." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financing Options 
</P>
<P>
Any public financing sought by Cooper likely would take the form of 
redevelopment bonds, which he characterizes as "not exactly public money" -- an 
arguable semantic distinction. Under that option, the additional tax revenue 
generated by the arena in future years would be used to reimburse the city for 
any public money spent now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we'd be asking the city to just give us $20 million," Cooper 
argued. "This would come out of the new additional taxes and other revenue that 
wouldn't be there without the arena. If this is going to be a good deal for the 
city, I see no reason why it shouldn't be willing to put up some money. So long 
as it doesn't cost taxpayers or take money away from sewers, police or other 
programs, I don't see that as a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Under the current Sports Arena lease, the city receives about $250,000 
annually, according to Deputy City Manager Maureen Stapleton. Cooper estimates 
that a new arena would raise the city's annual lease and property tax revenue 
to at least $3.5 million, as well as generate additional revenue stemming from 
increased consumer spending of up to $50 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Well aware of a new arena's potential for fattening the city's treasury -- 
thereby offsetting any initial public investment -- most council members say 
they have not ruled out the possible use of redevelopment funds for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
However, in order for that option to even be possible, the jurisdiction of the 
city's redevelopment agency would have to be expanded to include eastern 
downtown, according to Pam Hamilton, executive vice president of the Centre 
City Development Corp. For Cooper, that necessary legal change is only one of 
the many "ifs" on which possible city aid hinges. 
</P>
<P>
If the city ultimately opts to invest in the arena, it likely will find itself 
in partnership with far more parties than Cooper and Esquinas. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Cooper revealed that the financial linchpin of his plan involves 
convincing a company to spend up to $40 million -- roughly one-third of the 
estimated construction cost -- to have the arena named after it. In addition, 
Cooper hopes to attract other major investors, including firms that would do 
business at the arena, such as concessionaires and service companies -- even if 
that relegates him to a small minority ownership role. 
</P>
<P>
"We never claimed we had enough money to do this all by ourselves," Cooper 
said. "But we do have enough to get it started and make it happen. My feeling 
is that anyone with a chance to benefit from the upside of the arena also 
should be willing to take the risk for the downside. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time this is over, I may only own 5% of the deal. I don't want it to 
sound like I'm that flippant about possibly giving away ownership. But if 
that's what it takes to make this reality, my ego can live with that."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SDSU WANTS TO SLICE THE ACADEMIC BALONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legitimate research service? Or a knife in the heart of academic integrity? 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State University may be the arena for a fight between college 
professors and a West Los Angeles firm described as one of the nation's largest 
suppliers of custom-made term papers. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether officials at the California State University system will 
seek a court order to force the student newspaper, the Daily Aztec, to stop 
running ads for Research Assistance. The Aztec editor says 1st Amendment rights 
are at stake and hints the newspaper might resist in court. 
</P>
<P>
"We get complaints all the time about our ads for cigarette rolling papers, 
triple-X (movies), alcohol, phone-sex, abortion services and other things," 
said editor-in-chief Matt Dathe. "If we let the Research Assistance ad go, 
people will be after us to drop other ads they don't like." 
</P>
<P>
For several years SDSU officials have asked Aztec editors to drop the term 
paper ads, noting that the state Education Code prohibits the marketing of 
phony term papers for academic credit. The code carries no penalty. 
</P>
<P>
However, in February a judge issued an injunction against a free-lance term 
paper writer who supplied a paper for a student at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Emboldened, the SDSU administration then asked that the university system seek 
a similar injunction barring Research Assistance ads from the Aztec. The 
general counsel is mulling the request. 
</P>
<P>
"I have recommended that the general counsel take whatever steps are needed to 
make sure that such services are not marketed or employed on our campuses," 
said Lee Kerschner, the system's vice chancellor for academic affairs. "These 
firms are a threat to the very nature of the university, the integrity of the 
relationship between student and faculty member." 
</P>
<P>
Research Assistance, which boasts 16,000 papers for sale at $7 a page, protests 
that it only sells research and that the papers are not meant to be submitted 
in total. Administrators say that's baloney. 
</P>
<P>
Short of legal action, the Aztec could be ordered to drop the ads by the 
Publication Authority, a 12-member campus group which sets editorial and 
advertising policy. The issue will be discussed May 4. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carr, SDSU judicial officer, has not seen any cases of plagiarism 
involving purchased term papers. But he suspects some are slipping through. 
</P>
<P>
"There has got to be a reason the firm keeps advertising here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Street Smarts for 2 Bits 
</P>
<P>
As their numbers grow, the panhandlers in downtown San Diego are developing 
distinct styles to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
One young fellow advises would-be jaywalkers "that'll cost you $25 if the cops 
are watching." Then he asks for 25 cents: "Isn't my advice worth something?" 
</P>
<P>
Towering Over Adversity 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) was a fierce supporter of the failed nomination of 
John Tower to be secretary of defense -- even writing an in-your-face letter to 
a Tower detractor. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson knows to abandon a sunken ship. His standard stump speech now 
employs a Tower joke to warm up the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Take his speech at the Sheraton Harbor Island on Friday to a law-enforcement 
luncheon hosted by the district attorney. Wilson began with a gag about a sign 
in a foreign hotel that advises in fractured English: "Guests are invited to 
take advantage of our chambermaid." 
</P>
<P>
Added Wilson, "You should be careful not to arrange accommodations there for 
Senator Tower and certain others." 
</P>
<P>
Question Jogged His Ire 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy doesn't talk much to reporters these days, but when he does 
he sees no reason to pull punches. The topic last week was $36,000 in loans 
that Duffy says he forgot to list on his required disclosure forms until a 
reporter's question jogged his memory. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff does not see such matters as a fit topic of inquiry for the press: 
</P>
<P>
"What you want to do is fill up the space with juicy gossip . . . like this to 
pump your circulation so you can sell more ads. I've studied your business."

STILL ON THE DIVING BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On foreign policy, the Bush Administration acts like an Olympic diver, 
seemingly frozen on the high platform and complaining because timers keep 
pointing at their stop watches. 
</P>
<P>
Experience was the most important thing George Bush had going for him in the 
1988 presidential campaign. But Thursday marked the end of his third month in 
office -- perilously close to the end of the mythic first 100 days -- and still 
everything is under review. And there are no lights on in many crucial offices 
because nobody has moved into them. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration sources keep reminding impatient onlookers that haste makes 
waste and insisting that they will not be rushed into moves, particularly with 
respect to relations with the Soviet Union, that they may later regret. They 
counsel that what has happened at the end of Bush's presidency will count more 
than what happened at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to quarrel with any of this, but it is difficult to imagine that 
further delays will increase the confidence of people that Bush knows what he 
is about. It also is hard not to make comparisons with the views and attitudes 
of a veteran Soviet specialist like George Kennan, who created the policy of 
holding at bay Soviet communism until the flaws in the system became apparent 
even to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Kennan's concept of "containment" was more like an economic quarantine than the 
nuclear barriers to Soviet expansion that Washington put in place instead, much 
to Kennan's horror. But he was absolutely right on the other fundamentals of 
containment and he is entitled, more than anyone else, to savor the way things 
turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Kennan's penetrating intellect and his profound understanding of the Soviets 
gave him a consistent view of developments during the Cold War that was rare in 
the United States, if not unique. 
</P>
<P>
So much so that it was, or should have been, like listening to his first 
outline of the theory of containment when he told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee early this month that "the time for thinking (of the Soviet Union as 
a potential opponent in battle) has clearly passed." 
</P>
<P>
Kennan does not have the political power to declare the Cold War at an end, but 
he has the intellectual stature to advise the U.S. government where to 
concentrate its energies. 
</P>
<P>
One place is on large-scale reduction of nuclear weapons by the superpowers and 
mutual efforts to prevent their spread to other nations. Another is in joint 
efforts on global problems such as the environment. 
</P>
<P>
America is a pluralist society and preserving the diversity of opinion and 
culture that comes with pluralism is worth spending time listening to opposing 
views. But that time already has been taken and the President must switch, and 
quickly, from diversity of thought to unity of action on a new global policy 
for the United States.

ISRAEL AND THE INTIFADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was moved to tears by the very thought-provoking column of Waskow, who cried 
out with such unusual pathos, "Let my people go" to Israel, asking the Jewish 
government to let the Arabs go. First, I called Western Union and dispatched a 
telegram to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, asking him to immediately allow all 
Arabs to leave Israel so they can find true freedom in Saudi Arabia where there 
is lots of land, many mosques and lots of economic freedom as well. 
</P>
<P>
Second, I called the Israel Consulate and, informed the listeners of the 
contents of this moving article, and again asked the consul of Israel to soften 
his heart and allow the Arabs to leave Israel, which would also permit me and 
Waskow to have a pleasant Passover Seder without the trouble of changing our 
theology on short notice: two days before Passover. 
</P>
<P>
To my complete surprise the Israel Consulate secretary clerk, in the absence of 
her boss, told me that Israel is willing to allow all Arabs, on a voluntary 
basis, to leave Israel. 
</P>
<P>
As I was ready to hang up the phone, the secretary said: "Wait a minute, I have 
a question to ask you." She asked, "And what did Rabbi Waskow propose to do, to 
free the Jews who are jailed and oppressed, raped, killed and forcefully 
converted to other religions in Syria, Yemen, Iran, Ethiopia, and Lebanon?" I 
replied: "He did not mention those Jews at all, but why should you ask that of 
me?" She said, "You see, Mr. Lindner, I too want to have a good Seder, and the 
Jews of the Arab countries also crave for some Seder."

WATER WOES PERSIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down through the years in California, there was nothing like a little drought 
to rally support for grand water projects. But the drought of 1987-89 has had 
no such visible effect. There is no unity behind a statewide water policy that 
would meet the needs of the 21st Century. Most water agencies are facing 
greater demands on the same supplies they had several years ago. The old feud 
between Northern California and the South has flared up again. A new battle is 
brewing between cities and farmers over water. 
</P>
<P>
The California water situation has become so muddled that W. Don Maughan, 
chairman of the state Water Resources Control Board, has suggested that Gov. 
George Deukmejian and the Legislature get more involved in the debate. Given 
their sorry record on water issues in the 1980s, that might be considered a 
desperate move. But Maughan has a point if, and only if, the Legislature and 
the executive can enter the debate on a base of realism, having put rigid old 
positions behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Maughan noted that the California Water Plan has changed little since it was 
written in 1957 as the basis for the State Water Project. The plan worked under 
the assumption that California had enough water from traditional sources to 
serve all needs. It envisioned a project that would deliver more than 4 million 
acre-feet of water by the 21st Century. The project now is capable of producing 
only about half that goal, and there are no substantial new sources of water on 
the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
State officials should reexamine the old assumptions and "see what they really 
want to do," Maughan said. A symptom of the problem could be found in the 
effort of Maughan's board the past two years to set new water-quality standards 
in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The delta is the estuary that feeds San 
Francisco Bay and also supplies the State Water Project and the federal Central 
Valley Project that export massive amounts of water to customers from the San 
Francisco Bay Area to San Diego. While Southern California has counted on 
getting more water from the delta, the board's draft plan proposed a cutback in 
deliveries to the South in order to protect the delta environment. That 
outraged Southern California water managers, yet failed to satisfy Northern 
Californians, who wanted even more water to remain in the delta and the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is being redrafted, but there is not enough water to meet all 
requests. Environmental demands on California water are growing, and have 
gained increasing validity through court rulings and political proselyting. The 
expanding populations of both Northern and Southern California will need more 
water. Ironically, the 1987-89 drought has demonstrated that the region least 
able to sustain a prolonged shortage is the San Francisco Bay Area, which long 
had been isolated and comfortable with its direct pipelines into the Northern 
Sierra, including Yosemite National Park. As an increasing consumer of the 
state and federal projects, Northern California has become a major delta 
customer right alongside Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Booming Sacramento also is feeling the water pinch although city officials 
still refuse to install water meters in homes. Sacramentans use a third more 
water than Los Angeles residents, but northerners still complain about 
Angelenos wasting water on swimming pools and lush lawns. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of all this, water officials from urban coastal cities from San 
Francisco to San Diego have formed a coalition to push for water project 
additions. This has put California agriculture on the defensive, for it still 
uses more than 80% of all the state's developed water supply. A relatively 
minor reduction in farm water use would solve urban water problems for decades. 
But for that to occur, California would need a virtual revolution in water 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate future will require better management of the water California has 
now and stringent conservation by all users all the time -- not just in drought 
years. These goals certainly would be easier to achieve if Sacramento could 
manage to unite on some reasonable long-term policy guidelines.

FOR WANT OF A VOTE . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty-seven voters forced Julie Korenstein, The Times' choice for reelection to 
the Los Angeles Board of Education, into a runoff in the general election in 
June. Although nearly 70,000 voters marked ballots on April 11, a handful of 
votes denied Korenstein the majority she needed for outright victory. The 
results ought to persuade Californians everywhere that it matters a great deal 
whether they go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 305,000 voters were eligible to vote in the Korenstein election, but 
something less than 25% actually did so. Maybe the non-voters didn't care about 
the quality of instruction in the public schools or how much the teachers will 
get paid, the current controversies before the board. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the low voter turnout shouldn't be all that surprising. It is 
part of a national trend. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's presidential election attracted only half of the nation's eligible 
voters, according to the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, 
based in Washington, D.C. The voter turnout dropped in 48 states last November. 
California's turnout was a dismal 44.1%; only four states and the District of 
Columbia made a poorer showing. Many voters stayed home, according to experts 
at the research group, because they disliked both candidates, but making the 
best of a poor choice is often what voting is all about. In Los Angeles, the 
recent mayoral election drew barely 23% of the registered voters as Mayor Tom 
Bradley narrowly won an unprecedented fifth term on April 11. That was the 
worst turnout in more than three decades despite pervasive concerns about 
crime, traffic, growth and other challenges facing the city. 
</P>
<P>
Voter apathy must be contagious. Municipal elections in Orange County have 
drawn similarly low percentages. The turnout hit 23.5% in the elections last 
year in Los Alamitos, 25.9% in Fountain Valley and 22% in San Juan Capistrano, 
which hold elections again next month. 
</P>
<P>
Non-voters can always come up with a reason for not going to the polls. They 
are too busy, too tired, overworked, too indifferent or too smug to mail in a 
ballot or go into the voting booth. Those who believe their vote doesn't count 
should take a hard look at Korenstein's experience. 
</P>
<P>
On the day after the election, Korenstein held -- although barely -- the 
majority she needed to keep her seat on the school board. After the absentee 
ballots were counted, Korenstein fell a few votes short. If another 57 
supporters of Korenstein had gone to the polls in April, there would be no need 
for a runoff on June 6, persuasive evidence that every vote really does matter.

RUSHING TO RESCUE RISKS A PANIC AT S&amp;LS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts is a professor of political economy 
at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If President Bush isn't careful, he may have to declare a bank holiday for the 
nation's savings and loan institutions. That is the most likely consequence of 
the S&amp;L bill that is rushing through Congress with the momentum of a 
wartime measure. 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassed by the S&amp;L crisis and spurred by losses allegedly piling up at 
$1 billion a month, Congress and the White House are determined to quickly 
dispose of the issue and "get the crisis behind us." Consequently, legislation 
to drastically overhaul our financial system is moving from start to finish in 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
Such a rushed job leaves the bill's architects little time to ponder the 
possible results, which could include the worst financial panic since 1933 and 
a squeeze on mortgage financing. The bill is trying to do too much at once. It 
is dangerous because it is applying extreme measures to a delicate financial 
structure in the absence of public understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, S&amp;Ls are being forced to rapidly increase their capital base, 
while other provisions cut their profitability -- a main source of new capital 
-- and make them less attractive to potential acquirers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's basic goals are sound: to replenish the deposit insurance fund and 
to beef up S&amp;L capital. However, the unrealistic deadline for meeting the 
capital requirements and contradictory provisions could result in an even 
greater crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 430 insolvent S&amp;Ls including the 200 whose management 
has been taken over by the government. As of last September, 2,550 solvent 
institutions remained with assets totaling $1.2 trillion. Last month, the 
accounting firm of Peat Marwick Main estimated that 870 of these institutions 
with $450 billion in assets would not be able to meet the new capital 
requirements by the 1991 deadline. Thus, one effect of the bill could be to 
triple the number of problem S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, S&amp;Ls have until 1991 to achieve parity with bank capital 
requirements. Yet, the squeeze put on their profits and on their attractiveness 
as takeover or merger candidates by other provisions make this timetable 
unrealistic. The bill requires S&amp;Ls to pay higher deposit insurance 
premiums, which comes out of profit. The bill strips away attractive features 
of thrifts, such as their more liberal branching powers and their affiliated 
service corporations (insurance and real-estate), in the event they are 
acquired by bank holding companies. Since these are the very features that 
would make troubled thrifts attractive to commercial banks, capital injections 
are unlikely from this source. 
</P>
<P>
To top it all off, the bill puts a huge stumbling block in the path of healthy 
S&amp;Ls interested in taking over troubled ones. A provision of the bill known 
as the tangible net-worth proposal requires any S&amp;L involved in an 
acquisition to write down the book values of its own assets to current market 
values. This difference is defined as "good will" and must be deducted from the 
acquiring S&amp;L's net worth, thus greatly reducing its capital position and, 
perhaps, throwing it into the "impaired" capital category. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts that do not meet the new capital requirements are not allowed to grow. 
This leaves them the options of shrinking in size by selling assets to raise 
capital or trying to find a merger partner. If the asset sales further depress 
prices, additional write-downs will follow. 
</P>
<P>
The tangible net-worth proposal applies to "done deals" in which insolvent 
thrifts have been taken over by healthy ones, in effect turning sound business 
decisions into unsound ones and allowing federal supervisors to restrict 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
This is going on while the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy squeezes 
thrift profit margins and cuts the market value of assets, and while members of 
Congress talk about reopening S&amp;L deals that were allegedly too favorable 
to acquirers. 
</P>
<P>
This hasty and ill-considered change may prove indigestible. Depositors faced 
with rapid disappearance and merger of familiar thrifts, and statements by 
government officials of impending closures, provide the ingredients for a run 
on deposits. 
</P>
<P>
This bill may have the effect of nationalizing the thrift industry, as no 
private party in his right mind would acquire a troubled thrift under the 
provisions of the legislation slated for a Rose Garden signing in May.

COUNSELORS HELP MENTAL PATIENTS COPE WITH DAILY LIFE ON THE EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was only 8 a.m. and Bill Peck was already sweating. He had just dialed the 
home phone number of a woman he had hoped to check into a psychiatric ward by 
nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is answering. That's not a good sign," said the Los Angeles County 
social worker. 
</P>
<P>
In a previous visit, Peck had noticed that the young woman had begun chattering 
about the devil again. She was incontinent. Both were ominous signs for a woman 
with a history of trying to hurt herself with hot water, cigarette lighters and 
stove burners. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, Peck had located and counseled her. But in between there were 
several other mentally ill clients that day needing his attention: there was 
the delusional man in love with singer Joni Mitchell, a volatile young mother 
whose baby had been taken away and a frightened middle-aged man locked in a 
mental ward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Ways of Helping 
</P>
<P>
They are among the San Fernando Valley's most severely mentally ill -- those 
who will never completely escape their difficulties. But the county is 
providing a new way of helping them lead their lives as independently as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the county's Department of Mental Health kicked off a pilot project 
in the Valley to identify and give extra attention to the heaviest users of its 
services. Four veteran mental health workers crisscross the Valley most days to 
visit with 80 or so clients in the program. They serve as confidants and 
go-betweens with landlords, doctors, bill collectors and others in the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The program's average 20-person caseload for its social workers is far lighter 
than that of their colleagues, who must keep track of as many as 60 to 80 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We're their mother, their father, their friend," explained Peck, who makes his 
rounds in an aging orange Volkswagen bug with a leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
The intensive case management program, as it is called, is the first of its 
kind in Southern California. For county officials, it serves a dual purpose. 
Officials hope that the added investment in this select group of the neediest 
mentally ill not only will improve their lives but will save money and hospital 
bed space. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health administrators had grown concerned that a small percentage of 
troubled individuals had been costing the county millions of dollars, primarily 
for hospital stays. For many of these people, the return rate to state and 
county hospitals -- their second homes -- was dizzying. Before entering the 
pilot program, one former short-order cook in his 30s had been hospitalized 39 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment so far has lived up to expectations, county administrators said 
in recent interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea of the program is to see if there isn't a better way to serve 
this population. It seems it is certainly working," said Ken Miya, the 
program's project director. He attributed the success to the clients knowing 
that people who care about them are willing to help however they can. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospitalization Figures 
</P>
<P>
His yardstick is the latest set of figures on the number of days the program's 
enrollees are spending in hospitals. Before the program's start, 71 future 
participants had stayed a total of 4,383 days in county or state mental wards 
during the 1986-87 fiscal year. During the experiment's first 10 months, 
however, the same group spent just 687 days in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
That decrease meant the county paid $120,000 for hospital stays during the 
program's first 10 months, compared to $635,000 paid for hospitalization during 
the 1986-87 fiscal year, Miya said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the clients said during recent interviews that they are deeply 
appreciative of the extra attention the program's social workers provide. 
</P>
<P>
One of those was John, whose deep depression is such a constant in his life 
that his social worker cannot even classify it as recurrent. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it is the best thing the county has done," said the middle-aged man, on 
the verge of tears. "I don't feel lonely. I feel the county is protecting me. I 
need that. I need that very badly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Prototype 
</P>
<P>
The experiment has served as a prototype for the countywide mental health 
system. But with funds for the county's mental health network evaporating, the 
program's future remains clouded. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of every program is "up in the air," said Roberto Quiroz, the director 
of the county's mental health department. But he said, "When the dust clears, I 
think case management with the focus on the severely chronically mentally ill 
is the way we've got to go." 
</P>
<P>
The experiment began when a county computer was enlisted to identify the 
Valley's most dependent mentally ill clients. The criterion: those who had 
generated the biggest mental-health care bills in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
The computer extracted a pool of 1,530 from the Valley, Glendale and Eagle Rock 
who had used county mental health services the most. From that list, 
caseworkers started contacting the top 100 or so individuals to see if they 
would be interested in participating. 
</P>
<P>
Compiling the list turned out to be simple. Finding those on the printout and 
then persuading them to participate was trickier. Some didn't have permanent 
addresses -- a few lived in cars, parks or on the streets. The social workers 
located some when police dropped them off at emergency rooms after they had 
caused public disturbances during psychotic episodes. 
</P>
<P>
The responses of some who were approached, recalled Linda Graul, the project's 
supervisor, was: "Who the hell are you? Get out of my face." 
</P>
<P>
The typical participant is white, between ages 26 and 45, and living with 
family or in a residence. About half are males, half females. 
</P>
<P>
A small, idealistic staff started what they call their "missionary work" last 
April. Since then, the county's 
</P>
<P>
financial woes cut the program's staff in half to four caseworkers. Later, the 
full-time psychiatrist was reassigned elsewhere three days a week. After that 
happened late last year, the clients' rate of hospitalizations in state 
institutions jumped almost 400% during a period of four months. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the setbacks, the staff members said they remain committed to their 
clients, who oftentimes are estranged from family and friends whose patience 
dried up years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I go home at night and I'm exhausted. It's like having 20 children," said 
Lenore Lewis, a county social worker. "The rewards are small, but you get very 
excited when someone makes even some little progress." 
</P>
<P>
Just the week before, one of Lewis' clients, who thought she was Joan of Arc, 
took one of those small steps forward. Lewis kept a close eye on the woman 
until she could arrange for the staff psychiatrist to see her. The woman called 
Lewis two hours after she saw the psychiatrist and received new medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"She was so excited; the voices had lessened," Lewis said. "She could deal with 
her own thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist in Charge 
</P>
<P>
The psychiatrist who takes care of the group's medical needs is Dr. Paul 
Joseph, 35, who looks more like a Hollywood screenwriter than a doctor. The 
bearded physician, who wears a blue-jean jacket, a Swatch watch and fabric 
bracelets, quit his private practice to work with the homeless on the Santa 
Monica beaches a few years ago. He is apparently the only county psychiatrist 
who makes house calls, Graul said. 
</P>
<P>
The caseworkers have relied heavily upon Joseph to prescribe drugs because 
almost all their clients require medication. Most are taking six to eight 
drugs, and the wrong mix can be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
Suzy, for instance, entered the program with a set of prescriptions she had 
received at a hospital, but her behavior remained bizarre. Twenty times a day 
she was calling her caseworker, Sue Melton, telling her she was fired and then 
rehired. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph was summoned, and he prescribed a better combination of medications. 
Suzy's calls stopped, and he gradually weaned her off all medication. Today, 
Suzy is working at a yogurt shop and doing volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salvaged Furnishings 
</P>
<P>
The small staff meets frequently in their North Hollywood office, which is 
furnished with salvaged furniture and just two filing cabinets. Together, they 
provide moral support and brainstorm. Creative solutions are sought for the 
endless string of "what now?" dilemmas that come with the job. 
</P>
<P>
Some of caseworkers' approaches seem surprisingly simple. What for instance, 
can be done to prevent the deeply depressed person from trying to overdose with 
the medication in his bathroom cabinet? One tactic that has been tried is 
asking the client to sign a suicide contract promising not to kill himself 
before the next counseling appointment. So far it has worked. 
</P>
<P>
Vangie Montalvo, a bilingual caseworker, once resorted to an Old World "cure" 
to help one of her deeply troubled clients. The client, a 19-year-old woman who 
hears voices, would frighten her family by uncontrollably twisting her body in 
grotesque ways, Montalvo said. Complicating matters, the teen-ager had 
developed an adverse reaction to drugs that might have helped -- something that 
normally doesn't develop for 30 or 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino family believed that the teen-ager was the victim of a curse placed 
by one of her mother's co-workers. Montalvo didn't try to argue with the 
parents, and her suggestions for the daughter's care were largely spurned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Counseled 
</P>
<P>
So Montalvo turned to a social worker at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk 
who works with the superstitions of recent immigrants. He counseled the family 
using mainstream therapy methods, but also performed an exorcism, which seemed 
to improve the girl's condition, if only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
His advice to the family, Montalvo said, was "the same things I was telling 
them for months and other therapists have told them for years." "They were able 
to hear it from him and accept it from him much more readily." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Peck had his own challenges awaiting him the day that began with his 
telephone call to the potentially suicidal woman who had delusions about 
talking to the devil. 
</P>
<P>
One of those challenges was curled up in a chair and chain-smoking when he 
reached the door of her townhouse in Van Nuys. Like most of the clients, 
Claire, a bright young woman, cannot work because of her disability. Her infant 
child was taken away seven months earlier after social workers feared that the 
baby might be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Claire had been in a fury the night before, after her first day of classes at 
Pierce College. She thought the strangers in her class didn't like her and were 
trying to humiliate her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions About Child 
</P>
<P>
She became subdued when Peck asked about her baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what you want to do with Joey?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you feel about him not being here?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I don't want to give him up because I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
In one of her more candid moments, Claire, who had been struggling with whether 
to give up the baby to adoption, said: "I have no mothering skills. I feel 
awkward around him."

When Peck started to go, Claire bummed a dollar from him for gas for her car, 
showing him a coin purse that held only 78 cents. With no money, she said, she 
had been "ripping Ralphs off on a regular basis" with bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
She did say, however, that she hoped things would improve when her husband got 
his next paycheck more than a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Peck's next stop, the mental health staffers agree, was one of the program's 
shining successes. Before Peter joined the program, he would wander away from 
the various board-and-care homes where he lived, only to return hours later, 
sunburned with feet that were bloodied, apparently from walking miles barefoot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Hospitalizations 
</P>
<P>
Peter's greatest wish was to get his own apartment. But his 39 hospitalizations 
and compulsive spending had made that unlikely, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Peck eventually arranged for the move to an apartment, however, and visited 
Peter every day for months to make sure things went smoothly. Peter has 
remained out of the hospital and in his immaculately kept studio apartment in 
Van Nuys for almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bill comes by we have a little thing going," said Peter, who had become 
more paranoid in recent days. "When Bill's in my house, it turns into a 
psychiatric unit." 
</P>
<P>
It was harder for Peck to be optimistic about the next client he visited at 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center. John, a newcomer to the program, had no 
friends or family and often talked about starting his life over again -- his 
code words for suicide. He was scared that he would be trapped in the hospital 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
"My worst worry at this point, I have to be honest with you . . . is they 
aren't planning to let me go," John, clad in pajamas and slippers, told Peck. 
</P>
<P>
Peck assures John that he is wrong. And in a soft voice he tries to cheer him 
up. He tells him that he looks better since he lost some weight and that his 
hospital room is much nicer than those at the state mental hospital in 
Camarillo. Peck leaves, reassuring John that he will let his landlord know 
where he is. 
</P>
<P>
When he walks out of the hospital, Peck resumes thinking about the suicidal 
woman he needs to find tonight. And he remarks, "Well, you've seen a typical 
day."

'TRAIL DAYS' WORK PARTY GIVES STATE PARK A SPRING CLEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Hotel, a 55-year-old ex-track coach who on Saturday ran 24 miles to the top 
of Mt. Wilson, spent several hours Sunday swinging a pickax, helping to cut a 
new trail through Point Mugu State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"I stretched out real good before I came here," the Manhattan Beach resident 
said, with sweat rolling down his nose. "Besides, I'm not using my legs, just 
my upper body." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Maine, 29, an executive secretary and mountain bike enthusiast who wanted 
to improve the image of bicyclists as well as the trails, also swung an ax 
during the eighth annual "Trail Days" working party. 
</P>
<P>
"Mountain bikers are supposedly folks who rip up trails," said Maine, a 
Woodland Hills resident who is training to compete in national off-road bike 
events. "We're doing our thing for the cause of mountain bikers, so the Sierra 
Club won't look upon us so badly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bikers and Hikers 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen mountain bikers worked side-by-side with about 30 hikers this 
weekend during the two-day spring cleanup event, sponsored by the Sierra Club, 
the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the mountains' Trail Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although bikers are restricted to fire roads and not allowed to use the park's 
trails, several said they hope someday their efforts will pay off with greater 
access. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to work with other user groups to show we're not just a bunch of 
young kamikazes," said biker Peter Heuman, 33, of Woodland Hills as he dug 
rocks and roots out of a trail in Sycamore Canyon. "We're trying to give 
something back to the mountains, as well as to use them." 
</P>
<P>
Point Mugu, popular among bikers and horse riders as well as hikers, is an area 
near the western edge of the Santa Monica Mountains in Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties. It can be reached from Thousand Oaks to the north or from the Pacific 
Coast Highway on the south. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short Section 
</P>
<P>
The weekend working party concentrated on a 1 1/2-mile section of the 55-mile 
Backbone Trail that runs from the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu up to the spine 
of the mountains and down to end at Will Rogers State Park. In the area where 
most of the crew worked Sunday the air was pungent with sage. Sharp-spined 
yucca guarded the hillsides and golden yarrow and elderberry provided splashes 
of color. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Deese, a state park ranger, said the turnout for the weekend event was 
smaller than expected. But, he said, "everybody that's been here really worked, 
so we got almost as much done." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club's Ron Webster, who has been building trails in the Santa 
Monicas for 17 years, said half a mile of trail was pioneered this weekend. 
Other crews will return to smooth and widen it. Volunteers also helped remove 
obsolete fencing and cut brush and branches encroaching on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sore Muscles 
</P>
<P>
The price of the hard work, however, will be paid in sore muscles and bandaged 
blisters. Dennis Halliwell, 34, of Tujunga worked both days, camping Friday and 
Saturday nights at Danielson Ranch to get an early start. On Sunday, he 
complained of blisters on his hands, a sore back and tender thigh muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"For the next couple of days, I'll feel it," said Halliwell, who said he lifts 
nothing heavier than screwdrivers in his job installing commercial sound 
systems. But the discomfort has not deterred him from returning for four years 
running to work on the trails. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just doing our part, since we use them," Halliwell said.

HATCHER AND DODGERS KEEP ON TRUCKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The next time the San Francisco Giants come to Dodger Stadium, they may want to 
take down the license number of the grounds crew equipment truck. Why? Because 
this is what the guy driving that truck did to the Giants Sunday afternoon in 
the Dodgers' 7-6, 10-inning win before a sellout crowd of 48,493: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He played third base and left field for the home team, reached base five 
times, and scored the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He executed the hit-and-run to perfection twice with singles and sent the 
game into extra innings with an RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He made a head-first slide into first base on a ball bunted foul. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He got hit by another batted ball while running the bases, which cost him 
an out but got Mike Scioscia credited with a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He threw Robby Thompson's ground-rule double that had bounced back onto the 
field back into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And he took credit for the bases-loaded walk to Jeff Hamilton that decided 
the game, even though he was at third base when it happened. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it isn't every day that you'll find Mickey Hatcher behind the wheel, 
either, as he was an hour or so before the game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Most guys when they receive an award get a Mercedes -- I got awarded the 
bullpen truck," joked Hatcher, the Dodgers' most valuable maintenance man, 
after four hours and three minutes of dirty work that left him with skinned 
elbows, a stained uniform and a contented countenance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was running on one cylinder," said Hatcher, whose wide turn around third 
base caused rakes to be sent flying out of the back of the truck. "It had a 
little more jump than I thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
Had Sunday's game lasted much longer, both the Dodgers and Giants might have 
been forced to press the regular grounds crew into action. Hamilton was the 
last non-pitcher Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda had left when he sent him to the 
plate as a pinch-hitter with the bases loaded and two out in the 10th. Hamilton 
wasn't supposed to play, either, because he'd sprained his right ankle the 
night before. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Atlee Hammaker, the fifth Giant pitcher, do? He walks Hamilton on 
four pitches, only one of which was remotely close to the plate, to force in 
Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind getting beat, but I hate to give away the damn game," said Giant 
Manager Roger Craig, still trying to figure out how his team could possibly 
lose on a day that Will (The Thrill) Clark went five for five, including his 
fourth home run and an RBI single that gave the Giants a 6-5 lead in the top of 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really care if (Hammaker) walked Eddie Murray (which he did)," Craig 
said, "but damn, walking Hamilton? What's he batting?" 
</P>
<P>
A cool .196, that's what, and unable to swing the bat much before the game 
because he feared he might aggravate the ankle sprain. Could he have run a ball 
out had he made contact? 
</P>
<P>
"With my speed?" Hamilton said. "Instead of running an 8.2 in the 60, I would 
have run a 9-flat. If the play had been close, I don't think it would have 
mattered." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Hatcher said he took steps to keep that situation from occurring. 
</P>
<P>
"I tied his bat on his shoulder so he couldn't swing," Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray approved of that idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish he'd done that to me a couple of times," said Murray, who gave the 
Dodgers a 5-4 lead in the seventh with his third home run (first right-handed) 
but also struck out three times, including once with the bases loaded in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Murray wasn't alone in leaving runners on base, however. Both teams had 14 
hits, but the Giants left 15 runners on, the Dodgers 14. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela, still looking for his first win since last June 14, was 
given a 4-2 lead but couldn't get past the fifth inning after a yield of seven 
hits and four walks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset with myself because I couldn't throw strikes," said Valenzuela, 
whose aim was perfect when he flung his glove against the dugout wall. 
</P>
<P>
On the Giants' side, Tracy Jones -- still looking for his first hit of 1989 -- 
came up with the bases loaded in the 10th against Jay Howell but lined out to 
center field. Howell eventually got the win, although it took a kick save 
worthy of a hockey goalie: He stopped Ed Jurak's ground ball up the middle with 
his foot, which kept Brett Butler from scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"A weird game," said Willie Randolph, who walked four times, started the 
game-winning rally with a single, but also short-circuited a rally when he was 
called out for running inside the baseline in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like one year everything goes right for you -- and I wasn't here last 
year, but I know what that's like -- and then things don't come as easy. We've 
had a lot of weird things go on, but everybody in the division is bumping 
heads. We're still close." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph was trapped off third base in the 10th when Hammaker deftly gloved 
Dave Anderson's come-backer to the mound and ran down Randolph himself. But 
what might have seemed to be bad base-running on first glance was actually a 
game-saving play, according to Lasorda, who said Hammaker would have been 
better off trying for an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't make a double-play on that ball," said Lasorda, an ex-pitcher, 
"I'll kiss your butt. But he probably didn't think he could make the double 
play, and the winning run was in front of him." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda almost found himself kissing the game goodby when he elected not to 
walk Clark with first base open and two out in the eighth. He brought in 
left-hander Ray Searage instead, and Clark grounded a single up the middle. 
Given a similar choice with one out in the 10th, Lasorda had Howell walk Clark 
-- who is batting .591 (13 for 22) with 3 homers and 10 RBIs against the 
Dodgers in six games this season -- to pitch to Kevin Mitchell, who popped out. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, Lasorda had walked Clark, only to have Mitchell beat him with 
a ninth-inning base hit. He had to walk Clark in the 10th Sunday, he said, 
because he didn't want to play his infield in. 
</P>
<P>
"You do that, and you turn a .200 hitter into a .400 hitter," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Clark is hitting .409. "Then you make him an .800 hitter," 
Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Hatcher, the most dangerous .233 hitter the Dodgers have. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a reactor," he said modestly. 
</P>
<P>
That's why he didn't get out of the way on Scioscia's ground ball in the first. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Scioscia) I'm a team man," Hatcher said. "I said to him, 'When you win 
the batting title, remember that hit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Who can possibly forget Hatcher? 
</P>
<P>
"He does so many things for the ball team," Lasorda said, shaking his head. 
"He's a charger. He's amazing. I love the guy." 
</P>

MOORE IS TOO MUCH FOR ANGELS; A'S SWEEP SERIES WITH 2-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Oakland Athletics demonstrated once again Sunday, less can be more, 
provided Moore is your starting pitcher and the Angels your opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The A's were supposed to have been reduced to the a's without Jose Canseco and 
Mark McGwire in their lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Instead they are 13-6 after sweeping the Angels this weekend, with Mike Moore's 
2-0 victory before 25,681 at the Oakland Coliseum providing the finishing 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are 2-5 against the A's, 0-3 in Oakland and 0-2 against Moore, the 
free-agent pitcher from Seattle whom they lost to a higher bidder last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about the one that got away: Since snubbing the Angels for Oakland, Moore 
(2-1) has yet to allow the Angels a run -- pitching eight shutout innings in a 
5-0 victory in Anaheim and 7 2/3 more on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
If not for Claudell Washington, it might have been worse. It might have been a 
no-hitter. Moore, along with Oakland relievers Rick Honeycutt and Dennis 
Eckersley, limited the Angels to three hits -- all of them singles, all of them 
by Washington against Moore. 
</P>
<P>
And in an Oakland rotation that includes Dave Stewart, Bob Welch and Storm 
Davis, Moore technically ranks as the Athletics' fourth starter. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, if that's No. 4 . . . " Angel Manager Doug Rader said, shaking his head. 
"He's got good stuff. He's got a great fastball, good command of his slider and 
now he's fooling around with the forkball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very difficult pitcher to beat in the first place, and today, he 
pitched a great game." 
</P>
<P>
Only once did Moore allow a baserunner beyond first base. That was in the sixth 
inning, when the Angels loaded the bases with one out, setting the stage for 
Devon White and Wally Joyner . . . and a classic wasted opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland was leading, 1-0, scoring a second-inning run off Angel starter Kirk 
McCaskill (3-1), when Moore sandwiched walks to Kent Anderson and Jack Howell 
around a single by Washington. Then he worked the count to 2 and 0 to White, 
the Angels' RBI leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd get him right there," McCaskill said. "I thought we had 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Moore threw White three more pitches -- a high fastball, a curveball in the 
dirt, a slider outside the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
White swung and missed on all three. 
</P>
<P>
When Joyner followed with a fly ball to center field, Moore was out of the 
inning and the Angels were out of scoring chances for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we had one chance," Rader said. "We had one legitimate shot, and we 
didn't get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
And in such a game, White's strikeout took on major significance. Two of the 
pitches swung at were clearly balls three and four. With a walk, White would 
have forced home the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
But patience has never been a virtue with White, a free swinger who once was 
quoted as saying he'd rather strike out than walk. You know, walking can be 
boring -- and there's always the hope of the catcher dropping the third strike. 
</P>
<P>
When someone unearthed White's fabled better-strikeout-than-walk quote for 
Rader's benefit, the manager first grimaced, and then grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was a statement made by someone who really didn't think about it 
too seriously," Rader said. "That's like me saying, 'I'm going to eat that pile 
of (garbage) over there.' I mean, what's that? He was just talkin'. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd take Devo up in there in that situation every day and be grateful. He'll 
win more often than not." 
</P>
<P>
White chalked it up as "a bad at-bat." He added, "That's all I have to say 
about that. Those things happen. There's nothing you can do about it, you just 
hope it doesn't happen too often." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rader: "It's a thing you've just got to live through. If you try to temper 
that too much, you might lose the aggressive nature that makes him great. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tricky thing. You'd like a player to learn patience through experience 
than the other way around. It rare to have an aggressive guy nowadays. You want 
to keep him that way." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels managed one more baserunner the rest of the way, when Honeycutt 
walked Joyner with two out in the ninth. Such a pitching collapse prompted A's 
Manager Tony LaRussa to immediately replace Honeycutt with Eckersley, who 
retired Chili Davis for the final out and his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
If the Athletics are any worse off for the wear and tear on the bodies of 
Canseco and McGwire, don't tell the Angels about it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's still an awfully good club," Rader said. "They've got a good mix of 
left-handed and right-handed hitters, they've got a versatile lineup and 
they've got a versatile bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
The starting rotation isn't bad, either. The Angels are 2-5 against it, or at 
least some of it. 
</P>
<P>
Just wait until they get to face Dave Stewart. Coming off consecutive 20-win 
seasons, he's 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angel offense began and ended with Claudell Washington Sunday, with 
Washington providing all of three hits the Angels managed against Mike Moore. 
If Washington had some inside knowledge, it certainly wasn't contagious. "He's 
a finesse pitcher," Washington said of Moore. "To hit him, you have to stay 
back on the ball longer. I'm not a home run hitter, so it's not that hard a 
transition for me to make." Moore was only 3-8 against the Angels when he 
pitched for Seattle, but according to Washington, he's become a changed man 
since coming to Oakland. "They've taught him a lot since Seattle," Washington 
said. "And he's a fast learner. With him it used to be fastball, fastball, in 
and out, with an occasional changeup. Now, he's throwing more curveballs, 
mixing it up, and then he comes in with a fastball to take the bat out of your 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
Washington batted leadoff Sunday as Angel Manager Doug Rader, noting 
Washington's career .400 average (8 for 20) against Moore, did some lineup 
tinkering. Washington said he's had "some pretty good success" batting leadoff, 
which he did for Atlanta in the early 1980s and with the New York Yankees last 
year. "I filled in when Rickey (Henderson) was hurt," Washington said. "Stole 
some bases, too. These old legs have still got a few bags left in them." . . . 
Johnny Ray made his first appearance in a game since April 5, pinch-hitting for 
Kent Anderson in the eighth inning. He fouled out to third as the last batter 
Moore faced. 
</P>
<P>
The A's fourth straight rookie-of-the-year campaign was put on hold Sunday when 
the touted Felix Jose was demoted to triple-A to make room for pitcher Gene 
Nelson, re-activated from the disabled list. Jose, who had 16 RBIs in spring 
training and was supposed to ease the loss of Jose Canseco, batted just .125 
with two RBIs in nine games. His last appearance in a game was April 15, his 
last start April 13.

A FITTING FAREWELL TO KAREEM; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS BEAT SEATTLE IN CENTER'S GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
You might remember Sunday, the finale of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's regular-season 
farewell tour, for the Rolls-Royce and other lavish gifts he was presented, the 
heartfelt speeches, or simply the touching sight of his Laker teammates gently 
rocking him in a rocking chair during a musical interlude. 
</P>
<P>
It all was so memorable, such a fitting and emotional tribute to the retiring 
Laker center by his teammates, family and friends, coaches and management, as 
well as the 17,505 Forum fans to whom Abdul-Jabbar was the sole object of 
affection on this day. 
</P>
<P>
But remember this, too: It was not Abdul-Jabbar's final National Basketball 
Assn. game. That day will come sometime later this spring in the playoffs, when 
the Lakers will try to give Abdul-Jabbar another gift in the form of a seventh 
championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
This disclaimer was duly noted by most of the speakers at Sunday's ceremony, 
including Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and even broadcaster Chick Hearn. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Abdul-Jabbar later said in a news conference: "This one, we knew was 
coming, formally. The next goodby (will be) over and out. But it was nice to 
have this day." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, though their attention was diverted by the ceremony, certainly made 
the most of it. They defeated the Seattle SuperSonics, 121-117, to finish the 
season with 57 victories and make Abdul-Jabbar's day all the more memorable. 
</P>
<P>
And in his 1,560th, and last, regular-season game, Abdul-Jabbar played 26 
minutes, scored 10 points and had six rebounds. His last points came on a dunk 
off a Johnson pass with 2:14 to play. Thus, his NBA-record point total rests at 
38,387. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, noticeably inspired by the day's events -- "I was not about to let him 
lose on his day," he said -- had 29 points, 21 assists and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But, from a Laker viewpoint, this game was not about facts and figures, or even 
trying to go into Thursday night's playoff opener against Portland in the Forum 
with a five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose was to salute Abdul-Jabbar's 20 seasons in the NBA before Laker 
thoughts become preoccupied with the playoffs, to present the emotional 
culmination of a season of goodby ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, who has received a lot of gifts in recent months, was given a 
1989 Rolls-Royce "Silver Spirit" from his teammates, a lighted tennis court to 
be installed at his home in Hawaii from Laker owner Jerry Buss, and various 
other mementos and keepsakes from well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
Though unaccustomed to public displays of affection, Abdul-Jabbar seemed 
genuinely moved by the 45-minute pregame ceremony. His emotional layers were 
peeled away. 
</P>
<P>
It began promptly at 11:45 a.m., when the lights dimmed and a spotlight focused 
on a roped-off area near the south basket, where a a podium and a rocking chair 
were placed. 
</P>
<P>
After Hearn introduced Al and Cora Alcindor, Abdul-Jabbar's parents, and 
Kareem's four children, the spotlight followed Abdul-Jabbar through a tunnel 
and onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar raised his hands in acknowledgment, then sat in the rocking chair. 
The initial standing ovation lasted more than three minutes, Abdul-Jabbar 
shaking his head, smiling, looking up at the lights and making a brief swipe of 
his eyes with his right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
Hearn finally muffled the roar by exclaiming, "Remember, we got a playoff game 
Thursday . . . " 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by a rendition of the National Anthem, sung by Abdul-Jabbar's 
8-year-old son, Amir. Later, Abdul-Jabbar would say that Amir surprised him a 
few days before by asking whether they'd let him sing. 
</P>
<P>
Hearn read a telegram by President George Bush, lauding Abdul-Jabbar's 
accomplishments and his dedication in promoting literacy programs for youth. 
</P>
<P>
Gifts from the Lakers' radio network -- first-class, round-trip tickets to 
Hawaii for Abdul-Jabbar's parents -- and television network -- a vacation in 
Orlando, Fla., for Abdul-Jabbar, a guest and his parents -- were announced. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley then talked about Abdul-Jabbar's impact on the team, 
about how he has served as a role model to Laker players and coaches on and off 
the court. He read an open letter from the team to Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
"He is our mentor," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as the players left the bench and circled the rocking chair, the song, 
"That's What Friends Are For," was played. While teammates tipped the rocking 
chair, Kareem took in the scene around him. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the song, Abdul-Jabbar stood and was led by Johnson to a white 
Rolls-Royce towed onto the court during the song. After hugging his teammates, 
Abdul-Jabbar opened the door and slipped behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson then gave a simple but poignant tribute to Abdul-Jabbar. Pointing to 
the Rolls-Royce, Johnson began: 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely not enough. We should give you more than that. You've meant so 
much to all of us. . . . I've been fortunate to play 10 years with you. God has 
blessed me with the chance to get to know you, not only as a player but as a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember when I was a snottie-nosed rookie. Not only did you wipe my 
nose clean, but you put me on the path to be not only the player but the man I 
wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, near tears during his speech, later said he nearly lost control when 
he and Abdul-Jabbar made eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Vincent, mayor of Inglewood, was next on the docket. He announced that a 
side street outside the Forum has been renamed "Kareem Court." Buss' gift of a 
custom-made tennis court, was then announced by Hearn. Buss was not a part of 
the ceremony, but Hearn read a brief statement. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, 35 minutes after the ceremony began, it was Abdul-Jabbar's turn to 
address the crowd. But not before yet another standing ovation, this one 
lasting more than three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar raised his arms, then lowered his head, seemingly fighting back 
tears. As the ovation roared on, he curled under his lower lip stared straight 
ahead as applause turned to chants of "Kareem, Kareem, Kareem." 
</P>
<P>
When the ovation finally died, Abdul-Jabbar thanked, among others: 
</P>
<P>
 -- His parents: "When your dad is a cop and your mom believes in what's right 
and they set exacting standards for you, I've tried to live up to those. Thank 
you, Mom. Thank you, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 -- His children: "I'd like to thank these four little people over here because 
my relationship with them was not what it could have been because I had to step 
on this court. They never responded to anything but out of love and 
appreciation. I love you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former UCLA Coach John Wooden: "He taught me a whole lot about becoming a 
man. Not just basketball, but about living your life." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Teammates: "I think Mike Cooper and I go back the furthest, 11 years. This 
would be a very difficult life, if not for the people you work with. You guys 
(pointing to bench) and the other guys I have played with, that's what I'll 
remember. I'll never be able to work with people of that quality in a setting 
like we have here in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Nearing 12:30 p.m., the game's scheduled starting time, Abdul-Jabbar concluded 
his speech by saying: "I'm losing my voice. And I want to say to you all, thank 
you very much." 
</P>
<P>
A 10-minute break followed the ceremony's conclusion. When Laker players 
returned to the court, all were donning goggles except Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the game was anticlimactic. But the Lakers, after falling behind 
early, rallied to pull to within 67-65 at halftime. The Lakers took the lead 
early in the third quarter and never relinquished it. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers did not need to win. They are assured of the best record in the 
Western Conference. But it was as if Johnson willed it so. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-minute 10-second stretch of the second quarter, Johnson made four 
three-point shots. On the only possession he did not score, Johnson threw a 
one-hand, half-court pass through a congestion of bodies to Michael Cooper for 
a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Talk among the Lakers afterward centered on Abdul-Jabbar, not whether they 
would play Portland or Dallas in the first round. That could wait a day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his day," Riley said. "I knew Cap, when the guys came over and the song 
played, they got to him. You could see that he was moved." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar did not deny that. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of hard to cry because I was so happy," Abdul-Jabbar said. "When 
I'm happy, I'll smile." 
</P>
<P>
He smiled a lot Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too much, just wonderful," Abdul-Jabbar said of the ceremony. "I didn't 
think I'd pick up a Rolls-Royce along the way. I was ready for the recognition 
and a few tokens. A Rolls Royce is quite a token." 
</P>
<P>
The Rolls Royce reportedly cost Laker players and coaches $175,000. Riley said 
it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, we take this team thing for granted," Riley said. "We get jaded and 
cynical. (Kareem) is not just another guy. He's larger than life, and we've had 
the opportunity to be with him." 
</P>
<P>
With typical equanimity, Abdul-Jabbar summed up his career and impending 
departure from basketball this way: "I don't think I stayed too long, and I'm 
not leaving too early." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Magic Johnson's 29 points and 21 assists, James Worthy had 24 
points and A.C. Green 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Lakers. Xavier McDaniel 
had 39 points and Dale Ellis 27 for Seattle. . . . Johnson ended the season as 
the NBA's free-throw percentage champion at 91.1%. He is the first Laker to 
ever lead the NBA in that category. . . . The Lakers decided to keep reserve 
center Mark McNamara (sprained right ankle) on the active roster for the 
playoffs.

<P>
BURRELL RUNS 20.40, FASTEST 200 OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As sprinter Leroy Burrell settled into the starting blocks for the 200 meter 
dash at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays on Sunday, he looked to his left. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell, a junior at the University of Houston, couldn't help noticing Danny 
Everett, the Olympic bronze medalist in the 400, who was dropping down to the 
200. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really focused on beating Danny," Burrell said. "I was focusing on 
running my race." 
</P>
<P>
Burrell ran his race well. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell burst out of the blocks, ran a strong curve and maintained his lead in 
the straightaway. Burrell was clocked in 20.40 seconds, fastest time in the 
world this year, in beating Everett. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy I won the race," Burrell said. "And I'm happy to have beaten someone 
of Everett's caliber." 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who was left in the blocks, was timed in 20.53, fifth fastest time in 
the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who said his legs were tired, got out of the blocks so slowly that it 
looked as if he was waiting for a recall. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? 
</P>
<P>
"That's the curse of me not really training for the 200," Everett said. "Once I 
get into the rhythm of the race I can try to make up the ground I lost coming 
out of the blocks, but it doesn't always work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work out that way Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis was among the first to congratulate Burrell, who plopped down on a 
milk crate to catch his breath after the race. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is an assistant coach at the University of Houston, where he trains with 
Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
Was Lewis surprised by Burrell's strong showing? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised at how well he (Burrell) did," Lewis said. "I've been 
talking about Leroy for years. I think he's one of the great sprinter/jumpers. 
I'm not surprised at anything he does. 
</P>
<P>
"I see him train every day and he's very talented. He's the best sprinter in 
the NCAA and one of the greatest in the world right now." 
</P>
<P>
Burrell said Lewis has been an inspiration. Like Joe DeLoach, gold medalist in 
the 200 meters at Seoul who blossomed after training with Lewis, Burrell is 
learning from Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell, 22, a high school sprint star in Philadelphia, said he enrolled at 
Houston because he wanted to train with Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
What quality does Burrell admire in Lewis? 
</P>
<P>
"His mental focus," Burrell said. "One thing that I learned from Carl is that 
you've got to be driven. When you look at Carl, you see he's so driven in 
whatever he does." 
</P>
<P>
Like Lewis, Burrell is a multi-event athlete. Burrell plans to compete in the 
100, 200, long jump and 400 meter relay at the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. championships in June. 
</P>
<P>
What's his favorite event? 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't say," Burrell said. "My best event is whatever event I'm 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Burrell's race was the highlight of Sunday's competition. But there were other 
outstanding performances on the final day of the 31st annual meet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After failing to break the world record in the 800-meter relay because of 
an awkward handoff on Saturday, the Santa Monica Track Club recovered to run 
the fastest time in the world this year in the 400-meter relay, 38.63 seconds. 
It was also a meet and stadium record. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who decided to run the anchor leg after Saturday's disaster, said: "We 
ran because yesterday was like a semi-joke." 
</P>
<P>
After being hampered by a poor handoff on the anchor leg Saturday, the Santa 
Monica Track Club passed the baton smoothly on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After strong opening legs from Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard, Mark Witherspoon 
ran an extraordinary third leg to vault his team into the lead. Witherspoon 
made a nice pass to Lewis, who held the the lead down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not sure until the last minute if we were going to run," Lewis said. 
"We're just pleased to get it around the track." 
</P>
<P>
Did Lewis feel vindicated after Saturday's fiasco? 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday is gone," Lewis said. "That race happened and it's over with. We're 
just glad to be able to get around without a major problem today. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The men's and women's discus competition also produced some good marks. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schmidt of West Germany, former world record holder while competing 
for East Germany, threw the discus 219 feet to beat Mac Wilkins, the top-ranked 
American in 1988. Wilkins, whose best throw was 210-10, edged Mike Buncic 
(209-4). 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt had a good series, getting off throws of 217-8, 214-1 and 213-5. 
</P>
<P>
Laci Barnes won the women's discus with a throw of 198-9, best in the United 
States this year. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
The University of Florida ran the fastest 1,600-meter relay in America this 
year, 3:02.51. Florida's team consisted of Dennis Mitchell, Earl Diamond, 
Tyrone Kemp and Mark Everett.

<P>
DAVIS SHUFFLES, DEALS TO GET AN ACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What Al Davis' draft lacks in depth, it made up for in intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
Depth? The Rams drafted half a football team Sunday. The Raiders got Steve 
Wisniewski. If Raider fans were hoping against hope, and the odds, for a big 
name, at least they got a long one. 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski, a 6-3 1/2, 266-pound guard (listed) or a 6-4, 290-pounder (his 
figures) from Penn State, was a projected first rounder in several mock drafts. 
He went on the first pick of the second round . . . to the Dallas Cowboys, who 
then traded him to the Raiders for the few remaining high picks in silver and 
blackdom. 
</P>
<P>
A Raider official was detailed to call Wisniewski and tell him he'd just become 
a Raider. 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski wouldn't believe him. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I tell you," Wisniewski said from University Park, Pa., "I was picked by 
Dallas and I celebrated for 10 minutes. I was on the air down in Dallas. They 
had a hookup with my parents in Houston. They were celebrating that I was 
coming home and I was very happy about that. 
</P>
<P>
"Then someone in the Raider organization called. I didn't believe him at first. 
I thought one of my friends was fooling around. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a little while to get used to it. It hasn't sunk in yet but I'm very 
happy to be a Raider. I took off that nasty Dallas cap, threw it on the floor 
and put on a Raider shirt. It says, 'Real Men Wear Black.' So, obviously, I'm 
adjusting easily enough." 
</P>
<P>
Thus did the Raiders acquire what amounts to a first-round choice, after all. 
They also have Jay Schroeder, Willie Gault and last spring's three promising 
No. 1 picks to show for their past two drafts. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, has taken a whirlwind of wheeling and dealing. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Davis traded John Clay and his Nos. 3 and 4 picks to the San Diego 
Chargers for Jim Lachey. He traded his 1989 No. 1 and a '90 pick to the Chicago 
Bears for Gault. He traded Lachey and his '89 No. 3 (or Nos. 4 and 5, at his 
option) to the Washington Redskins for Schroeder. He traded Jesse Hester to the 
Atlanta Falcons for a No. 5. Then he got the Chargers to accept Napoleon 
McCallum, who was then still at sea, for the No. 3 and 4 picks they were owed. 
</P>
<P>
This still left the Raiders drafting only Nos. 2 and 3 or 2, 4 and 5 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They targeted several players they hoped might fall off the first round, 
including Wisniewski and Arkansas safety Steve Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
A Raider official says they had Wisniewski ranked in a group with their top 
offensive linemen, Notre Dame's Andy Heck and Boston College's Joe Wolf . . . 
who went 15th and 17th on the first round to the Seattle Seahawks and St. Louis 
Cardinals, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders figured they were running out of the money. But the New York 
Giants, who were thought to be interested in Wisniewski, took 300-pound Brian 
Williams of Minnesota, instead, with the 18th pick. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Oilers, choosing 23rd, and the Pittsburgh Steelers, selecting 25th, 
took two other offensive linemen, Florida's David Williams and Pitt's Tom 
Ricketts. The Raiders, figuring they were back in the race, phoned Dallas and 
asked to exchange places on the second round, the Cowboys then owning the first 
pick, the Raiders the 11th.

<P>
For a No. 3 and Atlanta's No. 5, the Cowboys said yes. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders then had them draft Wisniewski, since time was running out. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders then sent their No. 4 and 5 picks to the Redskins to complete the 
Schroeder deal. 
</P>
<P>
The price of all this? Since only the top rounds of the draft were completed 
Sunday, Wisniewski was not only the top Raider choice Sunday, he was their only 
choice. It's a heavy burden he has to shoulder, but he's still going off at 
better odds than Bob Buczkowski.

WHEN QUESTIONS ARISE, MIAMI HAS THE ANSWERS

When it came time to pull two first-round triggers, the Rams were left stunned 
at what remained on Sunday's draft table. So they stalked and talked and darn 
near balked, waiting until waning seconds before finally turning to Miami 
Twice. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to be so difficult. The Rams were almost locked into Miami 
defensive end Bill Hawkins at pick 21, but were forced to reconsider with so 
many blue-chippers left. 
</P>
<P>
Gnashing teeth as minutes passed, the Rams were left to ponder: How do you not 
take cornerback Louis Oliver, considered a top 10 pick in most circles? Or 
receiver Andre Rison? Or fullback Cleveland Gary? What were the Rams doing with 
this incredible opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
Panicking, as it turns out. With only 16 seconds left to choose in their 
allotted 15 minutes, the Rams scribbled Hawkins' name on some paper and raced 
it to the podium. 
</P>
<P>
They resisted temptation in the end and stuck to their guns, passing on the 
best-available athlete theory to fill a long-standing need at defensive end. It 
seemed a victory for the coaching staff, defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur in 
particular. This wasn't a public relations pick. 
</P>
<P>
So Bill Hawkins it was. He's tall (6-6) and lean (265) and was a three-year 
starter for the Hurricanes, who lost one football game the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a chance to develop into the big-time pass rusher we've always talked 
about but never found," Ram Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson wasn't out of the woods yet. 
</P>
<P>
Five picks later at 26, Miami fullback Cleveland Gary was still on the board 
and flashing like neon lights in front of Robinson's eyes. The Rams were still 
thinking defense, or maybe tight end. But not a fullback. Only minutes before, 
Robinson said that Robert Delpino, last year's rookie sensation, was a 
perfectly capable fullback. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the Rams couldn't pass on a big-name talent. They used every 
second of their 15 minutes and finally decided on Gary, passing over Auburn 
tight end Lawyer Tillman and Tennessee linebacker Keith DeLong. 
</P>
<P>
Just what the Rams need, another running back. But Robinson coached Gary in the 
Senior Bowl and claims he's one of the best receiving backs to come out of 
college in years. 
</P>
<P>
Gary wasn't as thrilled over the developments, figuring he never should have 
lasted long enough to become a Ram. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd be there," said Gary, who considered himself a top 10 pick. 
"But the decision's been made and I'm and L.A. Ram. I love it. . . . You have 
to prepare for things like that. I'm elated that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Next question: Are there enough footballs to go around? The Rams are suddenly 
well-stocked in the backfield, Gary joining a team that includes Greg Bell, 
Delpino, Buford McGee and last year's first round choice, Gaston Green. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson seems to think he can keep everyone happy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an area that we once did not have any depth," Robinson said. "We now have 
depth. This isn't a game where you can have one deep. It just isn't." 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't something have to give? Is Greg Bell on the trading block? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
What about Gary being a makeup pick for Green, who played sparingly as a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard one genius say that it's indicative of our feelings for Gaston Green," 
Robinson responded. "But that's way off. It's not even close." 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell whether the Rams will regret taking Gary over DeLong, a Ram 
favorite who went two picks later to the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
A brief look at the rest of the Rams' Sunday picks: 
</P>
<P>
Second Round 
</P>
<P>
45th choice -- Frank Stams, linebacker, Notre Dame. The final payoff for Eric 
Dickerson, Stams gives the Rams another outside pass rusher to go with Hawkins. 
Robinson compares Stams to the NFL's second-leading quarterback sacker last 
season. Lawrence Taylor? Bruce Smith? No, Kevin Greene, remember? The Rams' 
outside linebacker finished with 16 1/2, trailing only Reggie White of the 
Philadelphia Eagles for the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We see him like Kevin Greene," Robinson said of Stams. "He came off the corner 
for Notre Dame much like Kevin Greene did for us." 
</P>
<P>
Stams is a converted fullback and one of several prime-time players from Notre 
Dame's national championship defense. He led the Irish with seven sacks in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
One knock on Stams is his inability to drop into pass coverage. The Rams 
knocked on wood. Robinson spoke of Stams as if he were a son. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm not supposed to get emotionally involved with guys," he said. "But I 
really feel good about this guy." 
</P>
<P>
48th pick -- Brian Smith, defensive end/linebacker, Auburn. Like Hawkins, Smith 
is 6-foot-6, giving the Rams a pair of ends who can peer over a line of 
scrimmage for a change; unlike say, a Donald Evans. Rams' personnel director 
John Math calls Smith "747" because of his large wing span. He's also been 
called "String Bean," but that's what weight rooms are for. Smith is listed at 
245 pounds, though Robinson envisions him at 270 pounds some day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Richard Dent-type," said Robinson, careful not to actually compare 
Smith to the Chicago Bears' All-Pro. 
</P>
<P>
53rd pick -- Darryl Henley, cornerback, UCLA. He returns to a Bruin reunion 
that includes Gaston Green, James Washington, Flipper Anderson, Duval Love, et 
al. At 5-feet-8 and 165 pounds, Henley lacks size and muscle, but could be the 
punt returner the Rams have been looking for since receiver Henry Ellard became 
too valuable to risk returning kicks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great punt returner, and that's very positive for us," Robinson said. 
"His lack of size probably kept him from being a first-round corner. He played 
like a first-round corner." 
</P>
<P>
Henley's best shot this season seems to be as a nickel-back player. 
</P>
<P>
Third Round 
</P>
<P>
75th pick overall -- Kevin Robbins, offensive tackle, Michigan State. Right 
now, he's just the answer to Tony Mandarich's trivia question: Name the other 
tackle at Michigan State last season. Yes, it was Robbins, who pales in 
comparison to Mandarich at only 6-foot-4 and 286 pounds. Robbins, however, was 
an Academic All-Big 10 Conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth Round 
</P>
<P>
102nd pick overall -- Jeff Carlson, quarterback, Weber State. A local product 
from Pacifica High School in Cypress, Carlson could be that developmental 
quarterback Robinson was talking about. The lefthander passed for more than 
5,000 yards in his college career. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth Round 
</P>
<P>
135th pick overall -- Alfred Jackson, cornerback, San Diego State. A wide 
receiver in college, Jackson will compete for a spot in a very crowded Rams 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
As exected, Robinson said Sunday he would soon meet with veteran linebacker 
Carl Ekern, 34, and fullback Mike Guman, 31, and probably ask both to retire. . 
. . Darryl Henley is the brother of Thomas, a free-agent receiver recently 
signed by the Rams.

NFL TAKES PASS ON PEETE, WHOSE LONGEST DAY TURNS INTO OVERNIGHT WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Rodney Peete walked into a Century City hotel suite early Sunday evening with 
disappointment etched on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"A day that was supposed to be one of the most exciting days of my life turned 
out to be the most disappointing," the USC quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
Peete, runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, anticipated that he would be chosen no 
later than the second round of the National Football League draft. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the day droned by, through five rounds, Peete was still on the 
outside looking in. 
</P>
<P>
The charismatic quarterback, who holds virtually every USC passing record, was 
passed up through 139 choices. 
</P>
<P>
It was already known before the draft that Peete's crosstown rival, UCLA 
quarterback Troy Aikman, would be chosen by the Dallas Cowboys leading off the 
draft in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was believed that Peete would be a high draft choice with the 
speculation that he would might go to Green Bay, where his father, Willie, is 
the running backs coach. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay had other plans, and Peete was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, six quarterbacks were selected ahead of Peete through five rounds, 
even though the USC quarterback was one of the most prominent players in 
college football last season. 
</P>
<P>
Peete spent the day with his mother, Edna, in a hotel room, while some members 
of the media watched the televised draft proceedings on ESPN in another part of 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
And, when the first day of the draft ended, Peete's name still hadn't been 
called. 
</P>
<P>
Always available for interviews whether USC won or lost, Peete didn't want to 
be interviewed, sending word to the few remaining reporters that he was just 
too disappointed to talk. 
</P>
<P>
However, Channel 7 sportscaster Jim Hill asked Peete to reconsider his position 
without pressuring him. 
</P>
<P>
So Peete left the room he shared with his mother and made a short statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm very disappointed," Peete said. "I expected going into today to 
be gone by the first two rounds. As the rounds kept going, I was more and more 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I haven't gone (been drafted) right now. All I can do is look 
forward to tomorrow and see what is going to happen. All I want is an 
opportunity to play and, hopefully, I'll get that opportunity with a good ball 
club tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"By then, once I know what team I'm going to I could better answer your 
questions. But at this time it's really difficult for me to answer any 
questions because I really don't know anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish one of you guys would pinch me and wake me up from this nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Peete left the improvised media room without answering any questions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, another highly regarded USC quarterback, Paul McDonald, waited for his 
name to be called in the draft in, at least, the second round. 
</P>
<P>
But McDonald, like Peete, had to to wait and wait until he was finally drafted 
by Cleveland in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
Draft analysts gave Peete high grades for his leadership ability, mobility and 
making things happen on the field. 
</P>
<P>
He was downgraded only for his arm strength and, perhaps, the notion he wasn't 
a stereotype NFL pocket passer. 
</P>
<P>
However, it hadn't been predicted that he would go through five rounds without 
being drafted. The draft will conclude today with seven more rounds. 
</P>
<P>
It was anticipated that the San Diego Chargers might draft Peete, if Green Bay 
didn't. Ted Tollner, the former USC coach who recruited Peete, is now the 
Chargers' quarterback coach and he is exceptionally high on Peete's ability. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego chose quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver of Texas Tech in the second 
round, causing ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper to exclaim: "That makes no sense at 
at all. He's no better than a fourth, fifth or sixth-round pick." 
</P>
<P>
Kiper and other announcers kept reminding viewers that Peete was still 
available. 
</P>
<P>
However, it became apparent that it wasn't going to be Peete's day when 
quarterback Jeff Carlson of Weber State was chosen on the fourth round by the 
Rams, the 102nd pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
And it must have been painful for Peete to realize that his UCLA adversary, 
Aikman, was the most celebrated player in the draft even though Peete's Trojans 
beat Aikman's Bruins the past two years, sending USC, not UCLA, to the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Armato, an attorney who represents Peete through Management Plus 
Enterprises, said he was surprised by the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every scout said he was one of the top quarterbacks in the country," 
Armato said. "It's probably happening for the best, but the teams that passed 
him up made a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always been a winner and I'm sure he will be again. His true talent 
will show out in the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Warren Moon (of the Houston Oilers) was passed by in the draft by almost 
everybody. He went to Canada and now he's one of the highest paid players in 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Peete, an outstanding college baseball player for USC, made his intentions 
known months ago that he intends to pursue a pro football career. He might have 
second thoughts now that he's in the low draft-choice category. 
</P>
<P>
Five UCLA players were chosen before USC wide receiver Erik Affholter, Peete's 
primary target, was chosen on the fourth round, the 110th pick overall. He was 
selected by Washington, who then sent him to Green Bay in a pre-arranged deal.

WAITING BY PHONE;

<P>
AT THE END OF A LONG DAY, USC'S AFFHOLTER FINALLY GETS CALL FROM GREEN BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Day was turning into night and Erik Affholter was turning into a couch potato. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived at his father's home in Agoura around 10 a.m. Sunday, figuring that 
his name wasn't going to come up in the first round of the nationally televised 
NFL draft, which began an hour earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But the first round became the second, the third and then the fourth. The TV 
droned on, but still no word. 
</P>
<P>
Affholter was hardly surprised. Even though he was the leading pass receiver in 
USC history, he has heard all about his limitations. 
</P>
<P>
The scouting report of Joel Buchsbaum of Pro Football Weekly says of Affholter: 
"Lacks speed and acceleration. Is not a great runner after the catch." 
</P>
<P>
The National Football Scouting combine did not even list Affholter among its 
top dozen prospects at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"You just watch TV and see what happens," Affholter said. "That's all you can 
do. It made for a very stressful day. I was just trying to stay calm. I tried 
not to jump every time the phone rang. I was just waiting for the right ring." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it came at 4:15. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay Packer Coach Lindy Infante was on the line, telling Affholter they 
were going to go for him. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, that's not exactly the way it happened . In the fourth round, 
the Washington Redskins called the Packers and asked them to draft Long Beach 
State quarterback Jeff Graham, the man Washington wanted. The Redskins took 
Affholter later in the round and sent him to Green Bay for Graham. For their 
trouble, the Packers also picked up two draft choices from Washington, a fifth 
and an eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay receivers coach Buddy Geis has heard all the negative comments about 
Affholter, but he was still impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want receivers, not retrievers," Geis said. "What a receiver has to do 
first is get open to catch the ball. He (Affholter) has great hands. He finds 
the right area and he sits in that area. When he gets open, he doesn't keep 
running. He sits in the hole and says to the quarterback, 'You find me.' He 
makes that quick turn and the ball is on him. Whether it's high, low, left or 
right, he has the hands. He's a real plus for us to get in the fourth round." 
</P>
<P>
Affholter, who set records at USC for passes caught in the regular season, both 
in one season (63) and a career (118), has most often been compared to another 
receiver who can't run, can't accelerate, can't do anything other than catch 
the ball, Steve Largent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could have caught all those passes and made All-American 
without being able to run a little bit," Affholter said. "I've got to be able 
to get open a little bit. But I've been in that position my whole career. I've 
proved I could do it to myself and that's the only person I have to prove it 
to. Now we'll see how it goes at the next level." 
</P>
<P>
Affholter admitted it still hasn't totally sunk in that he has reached the next 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strange feeling to know I'm a Packer," he said. "It's like a childhood 
dream come true. But it's all conditional on making the team. I've still got to 
be better than the next guy. I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
But Affholter wouldn't deny that, as the hours went by and there was no word 
from the flickering box in front of him, the feeling that he might never get 
that call kept surfacing. 
</P>
<P>
"It does cross your mind," he said. "The scouting reports are just one man's 
opinion, but the teams give no indication what they are thinking. It's a scary 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Rodney Peete. Some of Affholter's euphoria Sunday was tempered by the 
fact that Peete, the throwing half of one of the most successful passing 
combinations in Trojan history, was not picked in Sunday's five-round draft. 
The remaining seven rounds will be held today. 
</P>
<P>
"We wished each other luck Saturday and that was that," Affholter said. "We 
plan to work out together at school tomorrow (Monday). But I would have thought 
he'd have been picked by now. In my mind, it's ridiculous that he wasn't. But 
whether he is drafted or not, I think he's going to go in and make a team and 
start in a couple of years. A lot of teams are making a mistake by not taking 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Actually Affholter came a lot closer than he knows to remaining on the end of 
Peete's passes. The Packers, according to Geis, seriously considered taking 
Peete on the third round. Instead, they went for Anthony Dilweg of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
"It practically came to a coin toss," Geis said. "We didn't know which way to 
go. They were so even." 
</P>
<P>
Affholter might seem even with a lot of fellow receivers, but he brings an 
extra weapon to the Packers -- a powerful foot. While at Oak Park High School 
in Agoura, he once kicked a 64-yard field goal, then a national record. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a wide receiver and that's what I plan on doing," Affholter said. "But who 
knows? If I need a leg, it will be there for me." 
</P>
<P>
One thing he doesn't need, but will be there anyway, is Green Bay's bad 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something I've never really done, (playing in cold weather)," Affholter 
said, "but football is football. Whether it's rain, snow or sun, hot or 10 
below, you've still got to keep your eye on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, Affholter was ready to go celebrate Sunday night. How? You can 
bet on one thing. He didn't spend it watching television. 
</P>
<P>
Enough's enough. 
</P>
<P>
When Carnell Lake came to UCLA, he was a running back. When he left, he was an 
All-American linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
So where's he going to play in the NFL? 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the above. 
</P>
<P>
Lake, a 6-0 1/2, 205-pounder, was selected on the second round Sunday by the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, who immediately informed the Culver City High School 
graduate he'll be moving to the defensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't come as any shock to Lake, who knew that his size was going to be 
a disadvantage in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I played some safety in the East-West Shrine game and in the Senior Bowl," 
Lake said, "because I was projected there in the pros by the scouts and they 
wanted to see me at that position. That's probably the best place for me to 
play. It's really my natural spot. Actually, I was not too far off there this 
year. With a lot of coverage we were in, it was almost like playing strong 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
Lake was one of three Bruins drafted on the second round Sunday. Immediately 
following him was running back Eric Ball, who went to the Cincinnati Bengals. 
Later in the round, defensive back Darryl Henley was selected by the Rams. And, 
of course, the first pick of the draft was UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman, who 
went to the Dallas Cowboys.

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLE HAS 31 AS CELTICS WIN, MAKE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps by subtraction it is possible to determine how valuable a player is to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
In a season in which second-year pro Ralph Lewis became a star, rookie Brian 
Shaw became a regular, center Robert Parish had a tremendous season and the 
Boston Celtics finally came up with a bench, they barely made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The one ingredient missing -- Larry Bird, who missed all but seven games 
because of surgery to both Achilles tendons. In other years, with Bird healthy, 
the Celtics breezed to division titles. 
</P>
<P>
Until their 82nd game Sunday at Boston, the once mighty Celtics didn't know if 
they would qualify for postseason play. A guard few heard of until a couple of 
weeks ago, Kevin Gamble scored 23 points of his career-high 31 points in the 
second half at Boston and the Celtics beat Charlotte, 120-110, to gain the 
eighth playoff spot in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics finished with a 42-40 record. Although Bird's ankles started to 
bother him late last season, the Celtics still finished with a 57-25 record. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble, a 6-foot-5 guard who played at Iowa, was playing in the Continental 
Basketball Assn. most of this season. When veteran Dennis Johnson sprained an 
ankle, Gamble became a starter. He started the last six games, averaging 22.8 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics led most of the way. With Gamble getting 15 points in the third 
quarter, they led by 11. He had eight more in the fourth as the Celtics 
maintained control. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who had lost three in a row, play Detroit, the team with the best 
record, in a best-of-five series beginning Friday night. Although he has not 
played since the surgery in November, the Celtics put Bird on their playoff 
roster. There was no indication that he will play. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 126, Sacramento 120 -- Maybe, the Trail Blazers didn't really want to 
play the Lakers in the first round. They had to go overtime at Portland to 
clinch the eighth playoff spot in the West. 
</P>
<P>
They led by 13 with 6:17 remaining, only to let the battling Kings draw even on 
two free throws by Wayman Tisdale with 13 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Porter missed a three-pointer at the gun and it was into overtime. The 
Blazers scored the first five points in overtime, two of them on a steal and 
layup by Danny Young. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler, who scored 40 points, made four of them in overtime and the 
Trail Blazers, with a 39-43 record, nosed out Dallas which won and put the 
pressure on Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 113, Denver 96 -- The Mavericks put all the pressure on the Portland 
Trail Blazers. With Roy Tarpley scoring 20 points and getting 20 rebounds the 
Mavericks snapped the Nuggets' 19-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
When Portland beat Sacramento in overtime, the Mavericks missed the playoffs. 
Instead, they qualified only to participate in the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
By losing, the Nuggets are forced to open the best-of-five first round series 
at Phoenix. If they had won they would have played Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 115, Washington 106 -- Charles Barkley took care of the Bullets' 
final playoff hopes and showed the league that he and his 76ers are ready for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had 31 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists at Philadelphia and the 76ers 
will meet the slumping New York Knicks in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets needed a victory, plus a Celtics loss to make postseason play. 
Instead, they are eligible for the flip, along with eight other teams, to see 
who gets the top collegiate player. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 99, Atlanta 81 -- Vinnie Johnson scored 23 points at Auburn Hills, 
Mich. and the Pistons ended the Hawks' nine-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons' 63-19 was the best in the league. They will open against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 90, Chicago 84 -- The Cavaliers were without injured regulars, Brad 
Daugherty, Larry Nance and Mark Price, but still whipped Chicago. All will be 
ready to face the Bulls in the opening round. The Bulls lost five of six during 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan, three-time scoring champion, closed out with 25 points. DAN

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
A SLIVER OF HOPE; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS WILL NEED A MIRACLE FINISH TO OVERCOME 3-0 LEAD BY CALGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is precedent to cite, miracle comebacks to conjure up to prove that it 
can be done. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1942 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Toronto Maple Leafs lost the first 
three games of their seven-game series but came back to win four straight to 
take the series from Detroit. And during the 1975 Stanley Cup playoffs, the New 
York Islanders lost their first three games, then won four straight to beat 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not impossible for the Kings to think that they can rally from this 
three-games-to-none hole they've dug for themselves. It's not impossible for 
them to win the last four games and beat the Calgary Flames for the Smythe 
Division title. 
</P>
<P>
It's just improbable. 
</P>
<P>
As Wayne Gretzky left the chill of the Kings' Culver City practice rink after a 
team workout Sunday, he paused in the noon sun on Sepulveda Boulevard just long 
enough to put the situation in perspective for the ever-growing media 
contingent following the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same as in the Edmonton series, when nobody expected us to come 
back," Gretzky said. "If we win (Game 4), it's 3-1 and all of a sudden we're in 
the same position we were in before. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other side of it, though, we're playing a pretty good hockey team that 
definitely wants to win the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
When he had been asked, the night before, if the Kings could match the 
comebacks of '42 and '75, he had said that the Flames were a little better team 
than the teams involved in those series. 
</P>
<P>
It was not by accident that the Flames accumulated 117 points in the regular 
season (54 victories, 9 ties in 80 games). 
</P>
<P>
It's not a terrible disgrace to lose to this team, although it is surprising to 
see the Kings going down 1-2-3. And 4? 
</P>
<P>
"I hate where we are right now," Gretzky said. "But I think we should remember 
that we have come a long way and done a lot of good things this season. I think 
we should be proud of what we've accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
Then he added: "We still have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game will be televised at 7:30 by Prime Ticket and broadcast by KLAC 
(570). If the Kings win, Game 5 will be played Wednesday night at Calgary. . . 
. The highlight of Sunday morning's practice was a shot by Marty McSorley that 
was hard enough to break the glass. . . . Steve Duchesne was really being 
optimistic Sunday morning. When someone said, "Four to go?" Duchesne said with 
a smile: "Twelve to go to the Stanley Cup."

Cineplex Session Expected: Directors of Cineplex Odeon Corp., the Canadian 
movie-theater concern, are expected to hold a board meeting Thursday that could 
prove tempestuous. The board has been urged by 49%-shareholder MCA to form an 
independent committee to weigh the impact of Cineplex Chairman Garth H. 
Drabinsky's plan to lead a group in buying a 30% stake controlled by the 
Charles R. Bronfman family. MCA -- which has fought the private transaction -- 
could wind up dominating such a committee if seven directors directly involved 
in the deal are eliminated. Of the remaining 9 Cineplex board seats, MCA holds 
five.

Tentative Braniff Deal: After nearly five months of talks with Braniff Inc. 
management, negotiators for the airline's pilots have approved a tentative 
contract proposal that one union official described as "a quantum leap into the 
future" for both groups. The tentative agreement, adopted late Friday night by 
the pilots' negotiating committee, now goes to the airline's 850 pilots for 
consideration. It will take about a week for union officials to present the 
proposal to pilots and for them to vote on it, said John Holland, chairman of 
the Master Executive Committee of the Braniff pilots union. If approved by the 
pilots, the contract still would have to be approved by the national leadership 
of the Air Line Pilots Assn., which represents Braniff pilots.

Ford Motor Co. on Friday announced new restrictions on smoking in its U.S. 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Effective June 1, smoking will be prohibited in conference rooms, training 
rooms, classrooms and auditoriums. The ban will be expanded Jan. 1, 1990, to 
include all enclosed offices and open office areas, the No. 2 auto maker said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions will not apply to smoking in open factory and garage areas 
within certain guidelines, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bold Step' 
</P>
<P>
Ford also said it would expand services and programs for both salaried and 
hourly employees interested in quitting smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Ford previously had designated smoking and non-smoking areas in cafeterias 
while smoking was prohibited in some work areas because of safety, Ford 
spokesman Dick Routh said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bold step forward but reflects a growing feeling among employees that 
they want a healthier work environment," Routh said.

GAS PRICES HIT HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE EARLY '86 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gasoline pump prices rose nearly a nickel a gallon nationwide the past two 
weeks to the highest level since 1986 because retailers passed on higher 
wholesale costs to motorists, an analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The jump followed a 10-cent-a-gallon increase two weeks ago after the Valdez 
oil spill, the single biggest jump in retail oil price history, said Trilby 
Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey, overall gasoline prices rose an average 4.86 cents to 
115.44 cents per gallon from April 8 to April 21, the highest gas price since 
early 1986 when prices started a steady decline, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The recent increases are due to higher wholesale costs caused by the Alaskan 
spill, a drop in OPEC production, a fire at a refinery and higher federal 
clean-air standards for fuel, said Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are expected to rise even more as these factors combine with the 
seasonal gas price increases caused by a greater demand at the pump by 
motorists taking spring and summer vacations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next two weeks, we can be sure that costs of gas will continue to 
rise through the peak summer driving weeks," said Lundberg. "Over that same 
period, we see an acceleration in wholesale prices. It's possible that many 
retailers will have to pass these new buying price increases on to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg said that prices could drop some if consumer demand drops and there's 
a sustained international oversupply of crude oil, which is refined into 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Self-service prices on April 21 were 106.02 cents for regular unleaded, 120.86 
for premium unleaded and 104.76 for regular leaded, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Full-service prices were 131.47 for regular unleaded, 142.79 for premium 
unleaded and 128.37 for regular leaded, the survey says.

EC Freezes Farm Prices: Agriculture ministers in the European Economic 
Community have agreed to freeze most farm prices within its 12 nations to keep 
the farm budget at $33 billion. After a weeklong debate, the 12 EEC ministers 
agreed to keep price supports generally at last year's levels. The biggest cut 
will be made in guarantees to growers of citrus fruits, down 7.5%. Prices for 
sugar will drop by 2%, although the community's executive commission had 
requested a 5% cut. A tax on the production of surplus milk will be reduced by 
25%, a move that milk producers had supported. The EEC farm budget is more than 
60% of the organization's total budget.

Coke Agrees to Buy Stake in Australian Firm: Coca-Cola Co. would acquire at 
least 41% of a major Australian food and tobacco company, Amatil Ltd., under a 
proposed reorganization plan. The deal has been approved by the boards of Coke, 
Amatil and BAT Industries, which is Amatil's largest shareholder, but is 
subject to the approval of Amatil shareholders and Australian regulatory 
authorities. Under the proposal, Amatil would concentrate on its core business 
of snack foods and soft drinks and would spin off its tobacco interests into a 
new company. Amatil is one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers in the world and 
one of Australia's largest companies.

AIRLINES, CITIES IN FIERCE BATTLE FOR JAPAN ROUTE; 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL EXPRESS SLOT CAN BENEFIT CARRIERS AND LOCAL ECONOMIES

Honolulu wants more Japanese honeymooners to vacation on its sandy beaches. 
Denver wants to lure Japanese skiers to its snow-covered mountain resorts. San 
Jose wants to link entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley with scientists in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
These cities have started to team up with U.S. airlines in an unusual 
competition for an air route between the United States and Japan. "Every city 
on the West Coast wants it," said Mark Butler, a marketing executive with 
Alaska's Anchorage International Airport. "Every city with an airport is going 
to try to get it." 
</P>
<P>
The competition among the cities, and among the airlines that want to fly to 
Japan, is the unexpected result of Federal Express' acquisition of Tiger 
International, a Los Angeles air cargo carrier with a large and 
long-established presence in Japan. When Federal Express bought Tiger last 
December, it said it no longer needed its own Portland-Tokyo route. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Transportation hasn't yet given its final approval to 
the merger between the two cargo carriers, although a decision is expected 
soon. Most industry experts expect the Transportation Department to allow 
Federal Express to give up its route, officially opening an intense competition 
for the Japan flight. 
</P>
<P>
So far, five passenger airlines -- Continental, American, Northwest, Delta and 
America West -- have staked a claim to fly to Japan from Honolulu or, in the 
case of American, from San Jose. A cargo airline, Orion Air, is expected to bid 
for a route to Tokyo from Portland -- the route served by Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department would choose the successor to Federal Express and 
would also decide whether the route should stay in Portland. It would also 
decide whether the flight should be restricted to light cargo. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger airlines argue that an existing agreement between the United 
States and Japan allows the Department of Transportation to convert the route 
from an all-cargo carrier and to shift its location from Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities, especially Honolulu, argue that the demand for passenger service 
is too great to ignore. The number of Japanese tourists who visit Hawaii each 
year is climbing by 10% to 15%, said Jeanne K. Schultz, deputy director of the 
Hawaiian Department of Transportation. "More would come if they could," she 
said. "The demand is there." 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry experts, in fact, think the Transportation Department already 
signaled its intention to convert the route to permit passengers. In December, 
the department turned down Orion Air's request that it be allowed to take over 
the Federal Express route. Orion contended it was entitled to the route because 
it was the department's second choice, behind Federal Express, in the initial 
competition two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Simons, Orion general counsel, says the air cargo line was 
disappointed. "We feel the route should be dedicated to small packages. There 
is plenty of competition on running passenger service to Japan," he said. "No 
(U.S. carrier) will be running a route once Federal Express is merged with 
Tiger." 
</P>
<P>
A Transportation Department spokesman refused comment on the issue, saying it 
is "premature" because final action hasn't been taken on the Federal 
Express-Tiger International merger. 
</P>
<P>
Observers say it's no surprise that so many airlines are lobbying for the Japan 
route. Since it is rare for a U.S. airline to give up a route between the two 
nations, few established routes ever become available. And though U.S. and 
Japanese governments are in talks over allowing more flights between the two 
countries, few in the airline industry expect an agreement this year. This 
makes the Federal Express route "a very significant route, a very valuable 
commodity," said Rod D. Margo, an aviation lawyer with Condon &amp; Forsyth in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For passenger carriers, a Japan flight is potentially very profitable. When 
United, American and Continental competed for a Seattle-Tokyo route last year, 
the airlines estimated their profits between $22 million and $28 million, 
depending on fares. In January, Continental was awarded that route, which 
became available as a result of United's $750-million purchase of Pan Am's 
Pacific division in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
And it is a market that's growing. U.S. airlines saw their U.S.-Japan market 
increase by nearly 40% between 1984 and last year, making it one of the 
fastest-growing international markets. 
</P>
<P>
The profits for a light cargo carrier aren't certain, at least from the 
experience of Federal Express. Though the company has never discussed its 
performance on the route, it is widely believed that Federal Express lost 
money. Simons, of Orion Air, said Orion believes it can make money because it 
plans to use Gulfstream jets, which are smaller and thus easier to fill than 
the Douglas DC-10s used by Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
Portland, as might be expected, is looking for a cargo carrier to succeed 
Federal Express. But other airport cities want a passenger route. Officials in 
San Jose say a route would be a boon to high-technology companies in the 
Silicon Valley, which conduct business with Japan and other Asian countries. 
Currently, San Jose doesn't offer any Asian flights. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials at Denver's Stapleton Airport think their tourism market is 
under-developed because it doesn't have direct Japan service. But, acknowledges 
Gennifer Sussman, senior economist for the airport, the metropolitan area can 
support only three nonstop flights a week to Tokyo right now. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Denver have tried to interest Continental and United, its two 
biggest carriers, in flying to Tokyo from Stapleton, but without success. 
</P>
<P>
It is Honolulu that has attracted the most interest from U.S. airlines vying to 
take over the route from Federal Express. That is in part due to growing demand 
for flights from Hawaii, as well as a push by the Hawaiian government for more 
air service. 
</P>
<P>
An additional flight from Hawaii "would be a small drop in the bucket," said 
Schultz. "But we don't want to pass up this opportunity" created by the merger 
of Federal Express with Tiger, she said.

China Foreign Debt Swells: China's foreign debt reached $40 billion at the end 
of last year, an increase of $5 billion from mid-1988, the official China Daily 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The government is now taking measures to cut foreign borrowing, which has been 
growing at an annual rate of 38% during the past four years, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the government has limited the number of financial 
institutions and government offices allowed to borrow abroad. Under new 
regulations, only 10 financial institutions are authorized to obtain foreign 
loans, and only the central bank, the People's Bank of China, can borrow from 
the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Zhang Jialun, a senior Finance Ministry official in charge of 
debt management, as saying China's debt is still manageable.

THE FLIP SIDE: EAST COAST COOL CAN SELL IN L.A.

While businesses in New York ranging from the Los Angeles Top Co. to the Malibu 
Pet Hotel attempt to cash in on the cachet of California names, a finger walk 
through the White Pages of the Los Angeles telephone directories indicates that 
the reverse is at least as common. 
</P>
<P>
Listings in the Los Angeles phone book show that "New York" has cachet in 
Southern California. The names of no fewer than 52 businesses in the central 
L.A. phone book begin with "New York." Another 14 are listed in the West Side 
book. 
</P>
<P>
As with the California names in New York, many of the Los Angeles businesses 
using "New York" in their names are clothing stores, suggesting that among 
apparel buyers the clothes may be more appealing if they're associated with the 
other side of the continent. "New York Surprise" on South Los Angeles Street 
turns out to be a women's clothing store. Others include New York Mink on 
Olympic Boulevard, New York Fashion in Hollywood and New York Pants on Crenshaw 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But the listings also suggest that the New York name may help in the marketing 
of everything from doughnuts to dentures as well. The L.A. phone book lists the 
New York Bakery, the New Yorker Bakery, New York Pizza and New York Dental 
Ceramics. There is also Manhattan City Bowling Supplies, a hat store called 
Manhattan Hattan and the Brooklyn Bagel Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to a few, however, suggest that use of "New York" isn't a guarantee of 
business longevity or success. An employee at the parent firm that owned two 
firms listed in the L.A. white pages, New York Feather Co. of California and 
New York Foam Sales, said the company has gotten out of both the feather and 
foam businesses. SCOT J. PALTROW

IMPERIOUS MANHATTAN IS EMBRACING STATE'S FASHION, FOOD AND ART.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could it be that Manhattan, the self-important hub of American cultural 
sophistication, is beginning to admire and perhaps even emulate California? 
</P>
<P>
To judge by California-style restaurants, stores, fashion collections and art 
galleries springing up in and around Manhattan Island, it would seem that New 
Yorkers' attitudes have evolved since Woody Allen dismissed Los Angeles as "a 
city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a 
red light." 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan, of course, is still Manhattan, and newsstands, tall buildings and 
briefcases still predominate. Haberdasheries selling conservative business 
attire still vastly outnumber the handful of boutiques selling neon-colored 
Lycra bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
But to gauge the emergence of California influence in Gotham, consider a 
three-square-block area in midtown Manhattan around Lexington Avenue and 59th 
Street. On Lexington between 59th and 60th is the California Clothing Co., 
purveying sportswear, athletic shoes and lightweight apparel, much of it 
imported from California. 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner, on Third Avenue, the Mulholland Drive Cafe, partly owned by 
actor Patrick Swayze, offers the authentic feel of an airy L.A. bistro to New 
York diners. It draws a fair number of celebrities, and it's big, open space, 
typical of Los Angeles-style restaurants, enables patrons to see each other or 
be seen. For New Yorkers eager to escape the litter on the streets, the honking 
and fumes of traffic, the restaurant offers, in the form of a mural that 
extends from the front door to the very back of the restaurant, the soothing 
vista of L.A. lights as seen from Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
And back at Lexington and 59th, Bloomingdale's flagship store offers the most 
glaring sign of all that things Californian have arrived in New York: A mammoth 
promotion of California wares is in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Mortimer, a California muralist, has painted the eastern facade of the 
building with a work titled "The 12 Californias." In a big corner display 
window, sand sculptor Todd Vander Pluym has built representations of California 
fun spots, including Disneyland and Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every window, set off by sand and baby cacti, is featuring California 
merchandise. The store is brimming with California-designed bathing suits, 
dresses, tableware, whole-grain breads, cooked breast of free-range duck, as 
well as perfumes bearing the names of Jaclyn Smith and Joan Collins. 
</P>
<P>
For six weeks, Bloomingdale's has been transformed into a California cornucopia 
in virtually every department at each of its 17 stores with the theme 
"California: The new international style." 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Bloomingdale's, which has regularly put on promotions 
of wares from countries such as China and France, has chosen instead to focus 
on an American state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Life Style People Dream of' 
</P>
<P>
Why? "Bloomingdale's feels that there's a lot of energy and imagination in 
California and a fresh, casual, wonderful life style out there that a lot of 
people want to emulate," said Miraed Smith, a Bloomingdale's spokeswoman. She 
said the idea for the promotion arose because the store's buyers increasingly 
felt that trends in clothing fashion and "home fashion" -- linen, tableware, 
decorative pottery -- were being set in California. In what may be a heretical 
view for a New Yorker, Smith said, "Maybe New York is becoming the Grand Dame 
and California is becoming the Bright Young Thing." 
</P>
<P>
Harried New Yorkers yearning for what they imagine is a more relaxed, 
sun-filled, easy-going style of living is one big reason for the growing market 
for California items in New York. Marjorie S. Deane, owner and publisher of the 
Tobe Report, a weekly New York publication on fashion merchandising, said the 
California influence in New York, although still limited, is real and growing. 
"It's the kind of life style, real or fake, that most people dream of having." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she says, more New York retail stores are sending buyers to 
California in search of special discoveries, although she sees no danger yet 
that California is about to overthrow the New York fashion establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Mackie, a California-born fashion designer whose "Spanish mission-inspired" 
chiffon evening dresses adorn one window at Bloomingdale's, agrees that "New 
Yorkers have always thought that they were the best anywhere and at anything," 
and probably will continue to do so. But he says the allure of California is 
growing, and New York is more accepting of ideas from the West Coast. He said 
stores such as Bloomingdale's are now more apt to recognize that California 
clothing "isn't corny leisure-wear; it's fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the openness to outside ideas -- what Deane sees as a trend toward 
recognizing that other parts of the country have something to contribute -- 
seems to account for a growing California influence. Some attribute it to a 
perceptible decline in the quality of life in New York -- decaying city 
services, legions of homeless, general degradation -- that lately has prompted 
comparisons in the press of New York with Calcutta, India. 
</P>
<P>
Among signs of accepting influences from outside is the small but distinct 
increase in the number of Manhattan art galleries presenting the works of 
California artists. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Auchincloss, the proprietor of a gallery on Broadway, moved to New York 
from Santa Barbara in late 1987. Her gallery features artists from Santa 
Barbara and the San Francisco Bay Area. She says that in New York, "there is a 
growing acceptance of what is going on in California." 
</P>
<P>
Auchincloss said she doesn't see demand for California art per se, but simply a 
perceptible decline in New York chauvinism. "Before, New York had maybe a bit 
of an attitude about its art over what's happening in the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attractive Presentation 
</P>
<P>
A growing acceptance in New York of contemporary art from outside also has 
influenced a Venice gallery, L.A. Louvre, to plan a New York branch, due to 
open in September. It will feature California artists, as well as European 
painters and sculptors. Peter Goulds, the gallery owner, said: "New York 
galleries and museums no longer confine themselves to looking into the city 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
In the realm of food, California's influence on New York cuisine has been 
notable for some time. It washed across Manhattan in a trend that Armando 
Russo, the owner of Cafe LA in Scarsdale, N.Y., called the "Spago-ization" of 
New York, and then receded, leaving behind permanent changes in New York 
cuisine. It includes an emphasis on salads and fresh vegetables, very light 
dishes and above all attractive presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The Zagat New York City Restaurant Survey has a special heading for notable 
Manhattan restaurants specializing in California cuisine and reviews nine. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing allure of authentic California ingredients and cuisine is still 
apparent in the success of restaurants such as Melrose in Greenwich Village, 
where chef Richard Krause, formerly employed at Ma Maison and Spago in Los 
Angeles, continues to offer dishes such as black bean soup with creme fraiche, 
avocado, cilantro and chilies. Lee Friedman, a co-owner with Krause of the 
restaurant, says much of its clientele comes because of the reputation in New 
York of Ma Maison and Spago. "Everybody who comes here knows where Richard's 
been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the influence of California on New York is spreading beyond the food to the 
design of the restaurant itself, says Michael Rotondi, one of the principals at 
the Los Angeles architectural firm Morphosis, which designed Kate Mantilini and 
a number of other Los Angeles-area restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Rotondi said the principal current influence of Los Angeles style on New York 
restaurants is that, as in Los Angeles, increasing numbers of architects rather 
than interior designers are being called on to design the restaurants. "People 
have realized that in restaurant design, the quality of the architecture can 
reflect the quality of the food and the quality of the service, so that the 
entire experience is conceived of as one entity," he said. "It's not divisible 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Rotondi notes that it has become common in Los Angeles, where space is more 
plentiful, to have architects rather than decorators design the interiors of 
restaurants. This trend, he says, is influencing New York. Among examples of 
this influence in New York he cited Le Cygne, an expensive restaurant on East 
54th Street. 
</P>
<P>
California also is credited with sparking the popularity of Mexican food in New 
York. There is a growing number of Mexican restaurants, or restaurants with 
Mexican-style offerings. Prudence Baird, a Los Angeles publicist, said she was 
astonished on a recent visit to Manhattan's Upper West Side. "I got a perfectly 
decent margarita," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And even on the down-scale end of the market, Taco Bell, which started in 
Downey and is now owned by Pepsico, is opening outlets in the New York area. 
Elliot Bloom, a Taco Bell spokesman, said that thanks to California's 
influence, "Mexican food has become a rage throughout the country."

TONY CURTIS: CENTER STAGE AS AN ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So he can act. But can he paint? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, was the consensus at the first Los Angeles exhibition of works by Tony 
Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
The sixtysomething, silver-haired Curtis drew a sizable crowd to the Beverly 
Hilton on Saturday night for a reception and viewing of his extensive 
collection of acrylics, pen and ink drawings and sketches, most done at his 
home in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
If his name was the draw, most were pleasantly surprised by Curtis' canvases. 
</P>
<P>
"This is top grade," said a fellow painter who said his name was "Ellis -- 
first and last. I paint in Europe, in Monte Carlo. Portraits mostly. And I'm 
surprised. He's very good -- for a movie star. Henry Fonda was very good too, 
but he had a different style. Photographic. Curtis follows in the tradition of 
Matisse and Van Gogh," he said, pronouncing the artist's name Van Hoch, with 
throat-clearing emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hugged by Friends 
</P>
<P>
But the nucleus of this party was Curtis, who was dogged by camera crews and 
hugged and congratulated by friends all night. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't have been happier had he just won an Academy Award. Curtis chatted 
with Walter Matthau, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Kirk Douglas, greeted strangers with, 
"Hi, I'm Tony," and occasionally pulled a reporter aside to try to explain his 
artist's philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I paint, I don't paint shapes, I paint colors. The most difficult thing 
to do is verbalize a painting. When I start painting, I have no idea what I'm 
going to do. The first color I use -- that tells me where the painting is 
going. It paints itself, and the painting tells me when it's finished. It's 
almost as if it does it for me." 
</P>
<P>
He starts painting at 6 a.m., finishing at 11 a.m. when the Hawaii sun becomes 
too harsh. "I wear my Picasso hat and Matisse shorts and my Arnold 
Schwarzenegger tank top and I paint!" 
</P>
<P>
His influences, he explained, include include Picasso, Matisse and Balthus. 
"But they're not dead to me," he explained. "When I look at their work, it's as 
if they just left the canvas." 
</P>
<P>
Filling out the crowd (some guests dressed in tuxedos and ball gowns) were

"I've wanted to see his work," said actress Theresa Russell, who was searching 
for change for a dollar. "I did the film 'Insignificance' with Tony, and I had 
seen his work in magazines, but never in person. I love the colors. The 
paintings seem so free -- he seems totally unintimidated by an empty canvas." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis' daughter Jamie Lee raced from one end of the room to another to point 
out the paintings she liked best. One was titled "First Bouquet," a still life 
of flowers done in sunny blues and yellows -- common color themes in Curtis' 
works. 
</P>
<P>
"But these are all new," she said. "I haven't seen them before. He paints in 
Hawaii, and I live here." 
</P>
<P>
Had he ever done a portrait of her? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. I'll show it to you," she said, gliding through the crowd while grabbing 
a shrimp and dipping it in cocktail sauce. 
</P>
<P>
"He did this in 1972," she said, arriving at the portrait. "You see, I have a 
crooked mouth. And no one ever acknowledged it. Only my dad would do that." 
</P>
<P>
But is he taken seriously as an artist as well as an actor? 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to take actors not seriously at anything," she said. "Politics, 
writing. . . . To have people praise his work is a real thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Hosting the party were literary agent Irving Lazar and his wife, Mary, who 
already own a Curtis or two. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of people from Europe here buying," said Lazar in between 
greeting guests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collectors Buy 
</P>
<P>
By 8 p.m., collectors had bought up more than $1 million of the paintings, some 
priced in the five figures, according to William Mett of Center Art 
Galleries-Hawaii, which exclusively represents Curtis worldwide. "There are 
collectors here from 17 nations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery also represents Anthony Quinn, Red Skelton and Margaret Keane, "who 
does those wondrous wide-eyed animals and children," Mett said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis says he has no trouble parting with his works; "I love the idea of 
selling them. They're not hard to part with. I never give them personalities. 
Jean Renoir was a friend of mine. And he once told me that the meaning comes 
after the work. That struck a chord in me. I just paint them. And I don't even 
care if people like them or not -- If I like it, that's what matters. I paint 
for myself."

ON YOUR OWN: SHAME OVER ABUSE BY 'THE WEAKER SEX' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: You have often written about women who remain in relationships with 
men who treat them like dirt. Well, I am ashamed to say that I am a successful 
49-year-old male lawyer who, for the past few years, has been seeing a woman 
who treats me terribly. She insults me, criticizes everything I do, screams at 
me, calls me names and is rarely affectionate. Recently, she threw a 
thoughtfully selected birthday gift that I had given to her in my face because 
it wasn't what she wanted. Yet when I try to end the relationship, I miss her 
so terribly that I call her or go over with flowers and start it again. I feel 
so humiliated that I won't even sign this letter. Perhaps you can tell me in 
your column if I'm the only man in the world who acts like Hedda Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hedda's behavior has certainly made lots of people in abusive 
relationships aware of how self-destructive they are being. No, you are not the 
only man who is voluntarily submitting to such abuse. Since I published my book 
on addictive relationships ("How to Break Your Addiction to a Person," Bantam), 
more than 60% of the people who have called for consultations with me about 
this problem have been men. 
</P>
<P>
Why do abusive relationships seem as though they are strictly a women's 
problem? For three reasons: 
</P>
<P>
First, men rarely require shelters because they are rarely physically beaten up 
and are generally not in danger to life and limb. 
</P>
<P>
Second, men are less likely to be economically dependent on women and forced to 
stay in bad relationships because of it. 
</P>
<P>
But the main reason is the result of stereotypes associated with traditional 
sex roles that hold that men are dominant and women submissive. Consequently, 
men are so deeply ashamed, as you are, of allowing themselves to be abused by 
the "weaker sex," that they keep it a deep, dark secret. While a woman often 
will tell others of the bad time she is receiving at the hands of a man, 
usually not even the closest friends or relatives of a man in a similar 
situation know that he is being so "unmanly." It certainly would not make 
acceptable locker-room talk. 
</P>
<P>
I see this difference between men and women in how they arrive at my office for 
a first consultation. A woman will usually carry my book openly, while a man, 
if he has it at all, keeps it in a "plain brown paper wrapper" to conceal his 
shameful plight. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that some men subject themselves to being abused by women. 
If the first woman in a man's life, his mother, did not freely give love and 
warmth, then he will be more familiar with that kind of relationship. In 
addition, he can become addicted to the task of trying to make an abusive woman 
more loving and put up with a lot in the process. 
</P>
<P>
It can be helpful for you to review what there has been in your experience with 
women, starting in early childhood, that has made you feel you are not 
deserving of a more loving woman. What made you feel you had to work so hard 
and put up with so much to get a woman's love? What would it feel like to be 
with a woman who loves you and enjoys being with you without you having to take 
abuse or stand on your head? Can you let yourself feel as passionately about a 
woman who is nice to you as one who is mean to you? 
</P>
<P>
It will take courage to reject the familiar role of being a victim, but the 
payoff is well worth it.

ARTS' FUNDING CHOICES LEAD TO COMPLAINTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture got an earful during a 
3 1/2-hour appeals hearing Friday for cultural groups dissatisfied with the 
commission's funding recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90 groups applied for a total of $5.28 million in hotel and motel bed 
tax money, approved last fall by the City Council for allocation to cultural 
groups and individual artists. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in August, the 15-member commission has been on a fast track, developing 
the funding criteria and instituting an application and review process that has 
brought it to this stage. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, representatives from about 50 disaffected groups picked a bone 
with the commission's recommendations. Given the limited supply of money and 
the large demand, much of Friday's meeting was predictable. 
</P>
<P>
With $5.28 million to distribute, the commission received requests totaling 
$5.7 million from San Diego's 12 biggest cultural institutions, groups with 
budgets larger than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, some mid- and small-sized groups questioned whether the commission's 
two evaluation panels read their applications. 
</P>
<P>
An evaluation panel made a huge error when it commented that the International 
Aerospace Hall of Fame served a "rather small public," said hall of fame 
director John Roche. "We do not serve a limited public," Roche said. "We've 
exceeded 220,000 people the last three years. And this year we will exceed 
239,000." 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of fame shares visitors and space with the Aerospace Museum in the 
renovated Ford Building in Balboa Park, Roche said. He said the organization 
has 600 members. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Lewis of the Civic Youth Orchestra took issue with comments by a 
commission evaluation panel that the orchestra musicians represented few of San 
Diego's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six schools are represented in the orchestra, he told the commissioners, 
adding that if the funding recommendation were not increased, the orchestra 
must consider disbanding half its programs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Repertory Theatre board member Jennifer Hankins took issue with its 
ranking of 3+ and panel comments about the Rep relying on a hit play to resolve 
its debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Severe cost controls and rigorous management are what 'saved' the 
organization," Hankins told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Under a formula, the 3+ translates into only a 7% increase over last year's 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
The commission rankings were based on several criteria, including artistic and 
administrative excellence, community support, arts in education, educational 
programs and impact on the community. The highest ranked groups received a 
score of 4. 
</P>
<P>
A top score of 4 is good for an 11% funding increase above the 1988 level. 
</P>
<P>
Groups were divided into three categories based on budget size. Level I groups 
have budgets above $2 million. Level II, budgets of $100,000 - $2 million. 
Level III institutions are those with budgets below $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The commission set aside $2.89 million for the 12 Level I groups; $1.42 million 
for the 32 Level II groups; and $401,830 for the 56 Level III groups that were 
recommended for funding. 
</P>
<P>
Level I groups receiving a top ranking of 4 included the Old Globe Theatre, the 
La Jolla Playhouse and the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. The San Diego 
Museum of Art received the lowest funded 2+/2 ranking for a Level I group which 
amounted to zero increase in funding from 1988, a commission spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will consider Friday's appeals during a meeting Wednesday and 
may revise some rankings, said commission executive director Victoria Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said a number of policy issues came "back to the table for us to work 
on over the next year. We'll be evaluating where the process is working and 
where we can make improvements." . 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said the board will likely give tighter guidelines to applicants in 
1990, limiting, for instance, requests to a percentage of the current budget. 
The commissioners will probably make visits to all 1989 recipients to provide 
next year's panels with site evaluations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Following Wednesday's meeting, the commission will hold a workshop with the 
City Council on May 3. The commission recommendations will then go to the 
council's Public Service and Safety Committee for a May 17 meeting and a May 31 
vote.

ECONOMICS IS KEY ELEMENT AS BLACK LEADERS SET GOALS 
</P>

<P>
A host of black leaders, running the political gamut from Republicans to 
Communist Party members, sounded a theme of unity Sunday and launched a new 
national black social agenda with an economic thrust. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fundamentally in an economic struggle," said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a 
keynote speaker at the three-day conference and one of its organizers. He said 
that the civil rights movement, which has emphasized political power for much 
of the last two decades, has entered "another stage" of development. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 participants of the "African American Summit '89" adopted a set of 
goals Sunday that called, among other things, for the use of part of state 
government and labor union pension funds for community development projects, 
the creation of an American Investment Bank to invest the pension funds and the 
payment of reparations to black Americans by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The summit also emphasized the importance of the nuclear family and called on 
the government to resume its role as a provider of housing for the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
Participants included Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), chairman of the 
Black Political Caucus; Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown; Muslim leader 
Louis Farrakhan; Coretta Scott King, widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; 
radical San Francisco State Prof. Angela Davis; Assemblywoman Maxine Waters 
(D-Los Angeles) and Joseph Lowery, director of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
That is virtually a who's who of black politics. But the list of who did not 
appear got almost as much attention as who appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Not attending, for various reasons, were black mayors such as Los Angeles' Tom 
Bradley, Atlanta's Andrew Young and Philadelphia's W. Wilson Goode. Also 
missing were NAACP President Benjamin L. Hooks, Virginia Lt. Gov. Douglas 
Wilder and Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Budget 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Some organizers, without naming names, criticized the no-shows. "There are some 
people who are not here who said this effort is not worth taking," Richard G. 
Hatcher, former mayor of Gary, Ind., and chairman of the event, said in a 
speech Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters, however, that he was satisfied with the attendance and that 
the large number of absentees does not indicate lack of unity. 
</P>
<P>
"This meeting is not about who is not here," he said. "It is about who is 
here." 
</P>
<P>
He said that many officials who wanted to attend could not cancel previously 
scheduled engagements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Cites Controversy 
</P>
<P>
Fred Brown, chairman of the Black Republican Council, announced last month that 
the 150 members of his organization would not attend because the controversial 
Farrakhan and Davis were invited. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders in New Orleans also had denounced the appearance of Farrakhan, 
who has drawn criticism for referring to Judaism as a "gutter religion" and 
making other anti-Semitic remarks. 
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of many black leaders to embrace the controversial Muslim leader 
was a major point of contention. Many participants accused blacks opposed to 
Farrakhan's appearance of bowing to pressure from whites. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick and tired of having white folks tell us when we can meet and who we 
can talk to," said David Richardson, a Pennsylvania state representative from 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan announced before the start of the conference that he would not 
attend. After his speaking role was enlarged, however, he changed his mind, 
notifying conference organizers Saturday that he would address the summit 
Sunday, said Ramona H. Edelin, one of the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1972 Meeting a Success 
</P>
<P>
The precursor to this weekend's summit meeting was a 1972 conference in Gary, 
which has been credited with launching blacks on a successful political course. 
</P>
<P>
"That meeting represented a shift in our direction," Hatcher, one of the 
nation's first black mayors and chairman of both gatherings, said here. 
</P>
<P>
"We left the streets, in a sense," he said. "We left the demonstrations and we 
began to get involved in the electoral area. We've come from a few hundred 
black elected officials in 1972 to about 7,000 today." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Hatcher and others said, this weekend's conference represented a 
stark break from past strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"Success for this meeting is to leave with direction and on the offensive, with 
an objective that matches the size of the problem," Jackson said in a speech 
Saturday. "We cannot have little solutions for a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explains Pension Plan 
</P>
<P>
Jackson proposed the pension fund plan in his address and fleshed it out 
further in a later meeting with black business people and pension fund 
managers. Under the plan, which he said he expects will meet resistance, 1% of 
the $800 billion in public-employee pension funds would be invested each year 
through the American Investment Bank to rebuild roads, bridges, sewers and 
houses in urban areas. He likened the idea to a domestic World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that he intends to take the idea to the leaders of both major political 
parties, Jackson said: "We intend to have a major series of meetings on 
economic development and access to capital." 
</P>
<P>
"I think what he has done is he has launched an idea and put forth a proposal 
and set in place a possible strategy that we can move forward with," Waters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of participants said that the United States should make reparation 
payments to blacks because their ancestors were slaves. In 1988, Congress 
approved payments for Americans of Japanese ancestry who were interned during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're good enough for the Japanese-Americans . . . they are good for 
those of us who worked for hundreds of years unpaid and who now need that 
capital . . . for our own development in this country," according to a document 
outlining the summit's goals. 
</P>
<P>
While lauding black political achievements during the 1970s and 1980s, Jackson 
and others said that, while black political involvement has increased, so has 
the rate of poverty, even as crime, drugs and other social ills have further 
eroded black gains. 
</P>
<P>
Exhorting conference participants to exert pressure in their communities on 
economic development agencies to invest in black neighborhoods and to form 
joint business ventures with established firms, Waters said: "There is no 
reason why white developers should still be developing in black neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
She said that blacks should pressure political leaders to redirect funds and 
lending institutions to stop redlining -- refusing loans to qualified blacks -- 
in black areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan Addresses Group 
</P>
<P>
In his speech Sunday, Farrakhan said that the black political agenda has done 
little to help the masses. "We must stop this vanity," he said. "We must stop 
this self-seeking. And we must ache when our little brother in the ghetto 
aches. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to develop a mechanism that will allow us to lift our own people." 
</P>
<P>
He also expressed mild disagreement with the term "African American," which 
black leaders said last December that they would use instead of "black." 
</P>
<P>
"Even though you say African American, let this never be a denial of black, 
because even before there was a continent named Africa we were black," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes the term excludes black people in other parts of the 
world besides Africa and the United States.

WIDE-RANGING CONTROLS WILL BE COSTLY;

<P>
CLEAN AIR: BUSINESSES NOT BREATHING EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Oliver Coury was beating a path around hangers of dry-cleaned clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"My family's been in this business since 1907," he said, looking over his 
shoulder and leading a visitor to his dry-cleaning machine. The machine, 
purchased in 1962, turns out 120 pounds of clothes every hour. 
</P>
<P>
It also throws off more chemical fumes than air pollution officials can 
tolerate. The South Coast Air Quality Management District wants to force Coury 
&amp; Son Dry Cleaners in Redondo Beach -- and others like them throughout the 
four-county basin -- to buy new machines that produce less pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Coury doesn't want to spend the money -- as much as $70,000. Nor does he like 
what he calls the district's "political coercion." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Coury is like a lot of businessmen -- big and small -- who are only now 
beginning to understand the implications of a massive clean air plan approved 
March 17 by the AQMD. The plan calls for tough new controls, not only for 
traditional targets like oil refineries and auto makers, but "mom-and-pop" 
operations like Coury's and many consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals are not without controversy. Before voting against the entire 
plan, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich heaped derision on several 
of the proposals, including one to build an electric train to transport garbage 
out of the basin and another to ban the use of lighter fluid on back yard 
barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
"Use a barbecue, go to jail," Antonovich deadpanned into television cameras at 
a press conference shortly before the March vote. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials admit that banning charcoal lighter fluid won't have much 
of an impact on air pollution. Nonetheless, it appears to have been effective 
in bringing home the idea that everyone has a stake and a role to play in the 
fight against air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take it out of the plan because it sends a message that we all 
have to do our share," AQMD Executive Officer James M. Lents told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Little in everyday life is left untouched by the new plan. Underarm 
antiperspirants and deodorants and other household goods, gasoline-powered lawn 
and garden equipment, drive-through restaurant and bank teller service, even 
the kind of tires on the family car are all marked for controls to be phased in 
in three stages over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Stage One relies on readily available air pollution controls such as those that 
would be imposed on Coury's dry-cleaning establishment. It covers the first 
five years of the plan. Stage Two would require significant technological 
advancements in controlling mainly motor vehicles and producers of coatings and 
solvents. Most changes would be in effect by the year 2000. Stage Three relies 
on ambitious long-range breakthroughs in technologies not now commercially 
available, such as advances in solar cells and superconductors. Stage Three 
would end in 2007. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the rules must be approved by the 12-member board after public 
hearings. Rules covering emissions of smog-creating organic compounds already 
have been approved for two kinds of businesses: automobile spray paint shops 
and manufacturers of adhesives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impressive Gains 
</P>
<P>
Although impressive gains have been made over the last several decades to meet 
federal clean air standards, the controls on motor vehicles and major sources 
of pollution have not been enough. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Basin remains the smoggiest urban area in the nation. 
Health-threatening ozone is often three times higher than the federal standard. 
The basin is the only area in the nation that still fails to meet the standard 
for nitrogen dioxide. It also exceeds limits set for carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the district would meet the nitrogen dioxide standard by 
the end of 1996, the carbon monoxide standard by the end of 1997 and the ozone 
standard by the end of 2007. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals and businesses have expressed mixed reactions to the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
Coury, who operates the family dry-cleaning store, acknowledged that air 
pollution is a problem. He said he is willing to do his part but would like to 
have more time to comply.

"We all contribute to air pollution, so we don't know who is doing what to 
what. I believe in everybody tightening up, but within limits of the equipment 
and costs we can afford. But they're pushing the little people more than the 
big people," Coury said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Coury's equipment, the AQMD said, is that clothes are cleaned 
in one machine and dried in another, much like clothes are washed and dried in 
homes. When the washing is done, workers must unload the cleaning machine and 
move the clothes to a dryer. During the transfer, emissions of smog-forming 
volatile organic compounds escape into the air from the cleaning solvent, 
perchloroethylene -- which has been shown to cause cancer in animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Machine Plan 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD wants dry cleaners to install machines that both clean and dry without 
having to transfer the loads from cleaner to dryer. 
</P>
<P>
"They're great," said Coury of the new designs. "I'd like to have one, just 
from the simplicity standpoint. But it's a question of timing and of 
economics." 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the dry cleaners in the four-county South Coast Air Basin 
already have the "dry-to-dry" designs. But if the proposals take effect, even 
smaller dry cleaners, which now are exempted from controls, would need to get 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
"It complicates our job. We have to get a lot of permits," said Simon Oh, who 
operates Palace Cleaners in Glendale. But, he said, he is not bothered that 
much. Over the long run, he said, more-advanced dry-cleaning systems with 
closed loops that recycle solvent will save money while reducing air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Don Burns, a lobbyist for the swimming pool and spa industry, echoed the 
concerns of many businessmen about what they see as the AQMD's unrealistic 
demands. Burns said his industry is especially concerned about requiring solar 
panels to heat pools and spas. This could add $12,000 to $14,000 to the price 
of a pool, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting Will Rogers, Burns made light of what he suggested was the AQMD's 
practice of generating broad pollution goals and then leaving it up to industry 
to figure out how to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Boil North Atlantic' 
</P>
<P>
"I have a solution for the elimination of the German submarine menace in the 
North Atlantic," Burns quoted Rogers as saying. "Gentlemen and ladies, boil the 
North Atlantic and they'll pop right up." 
</P>
<P>
"Rogers said: 'I can tell by the looks on your faces that you think I should 
come up with more than just that. Well, I am the idea man. I leave it to your 
technician to solve the minor details.' " 
</P>
<P>
R.E. Robinson of the Southern California Paint and Coatings Assn. said his 
industry doesn't know how to produce paints and other coatings that are as low 
in volatile organic compounds as the district wants and would still protect 
homes and other things that are painted. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously don't know how to do that or how it's going to be done right now. 
But who knows what's going to happen in 10 or 20 years," he told the AQMD 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The district proposes, for example, to impose extra charges on manufacturers 
that turn out products with high emissions. The idea is to speed research and 
development into low emission paints, lacquers and other coatings. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Burton of the Barbecue Industry Assn., like many touched by the 
proposals, said the trade group is all in favor of clean air. "However, we are 
concerned with the specific aspect of the plan which targets charcoal starter 
fluid," she said. She said the industry could not reformulate the product to 
give off fewer emissions, as one proposal would require. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smuggling Problem 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials say there would be little smuggling of lighter fluid. But 
critics aren't so sure. They note that determined back yard barbecuers could 
always go outside the four-county basin to purchase lighter fluid. 
</P>
<P>
At Van de Kamps bakery on San Fernando Road in Los Angeles, not much thought 
has been given to proposed new rules to limit emissions of ethanol from bakery 
ovens. The AQMD has said that while fresh baked bread may be pleasing to the 
smell, it also contributes to smog formation. 
</P>
<P>
Local plant officials said they have heard of no planning to meet the new rule 
if it is put into effect. But the American Bakers Assn. said there is a serious 
question whether controls on ethanol would have any favorable impact on air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Studies in the Bay Area show that ethanol is far less reactive in the 
atmosphere than other pollutants. "This low reactivity in the Bay Area shows 
that there will be absolutely no improvement in air quality as a result of 
controls," association attorney Patrick Cafferty has told officials. 
</P>
<P>
Auto spray paint shops are among the small number of businesses that already 
face the new rules. One, to be phased in over six years, requires auto spray 
paint shops to use less-volatile paints and improved nozzles that blow more of 
the paint onto the car and less into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be difficult, there's no denying that. Most everyone is going to 
have to reformulate their paint," said Ray Poulin, who supervises five Earl 
Scheib shops in Los Angeles. "It's going to be expensive changing equipment we 
already have, like spray guns." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Would Rise 
</P>
<P>
Poulin said it is too early to say how much the cost of a paint job might go 
up. They range from $99.95 to about $250. "I know the boss doesn't want to go 
over $100 on his regular paint jobs," Poulin said. 
</P>
<P>
But the AQMD said the rule could result in some savings for spray paint shops, 
particularly with new spray guns that run at lower pressure and waste less 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
Like Coury of the dry-cleaning shop, Poulin said he believes the fight against 
smog should be directed at bigger polluters. "In all honesty," Poulin said, "it 
seems they ought to go after truck drivers and buses. You get behind a city bus 
and some of those things will choke you to death." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, diesel buses are targeted. State-imposed limits on emissions take 
effect for the 1991 model year and the district proposes to meet those 
standards by switching from diesel to a cleaner-burning fuel, like methanol or 
propane. The Southern California Rapid Transit District has plans to purchase 
about 30 methanol-powered buses later this year. Several methanol-powered buses 
are being used in Riverside and San Francisco on a trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the 30 methanol buses are scheduled to arrive in late May and five 
buses that run on compressed natural gas are due in late July or mid-August, 
the RTD said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working with the AQMD, the state Air Resources Board and all kinds of 
organizations in the (methanol bus) testing program," RTD spokesman Rick Jager 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protest Over Costs 
</P>
<P>
During development of the district plan, oil companies and electrical utilities 
protested about the costs involved in further reducing pollution. But the AQMD 
said a compromise announced last week between its staff and Southern California 
Edison Co. on emissions from steam boilers could point the way to similar 
accords with other industries that reduce compliance costs while still 
achieving air quality goals within the 20-year deadline established by the AQMD 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest of the new rules cover nitrogen oxides, a major ingredient of 
photochemical smog that is more expensive to control than hydrocarbons. Thus, 
the AQMD's plan has raised special concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In Edison's case, the utility would be allowed an additional seven years to 
meet emission limits on nitrogen oxides, but those limits would be stricter 
than originally proposed. Moreover, Edison would be permitted to meet the 
limits by averaging its nitrogen oxide emissions from all its boilers. Edison 
would thus avoid the necessity of installing expensive controls on all its 
boilers. 
</P>
<P>
Edison now believes it can get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
Much the same is being said by Chevron U.S.A. Inc., which operates a major 
refinery in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean it won't be difficult or expensive. Nitrogen oxide emissions 
are now limited to 0.14 parts per million of British thermal units 
(p.p.m./BTU). By 1991-92 that will be tightened to 0.06 p.p.m./BTU and then to 
0.03 p.p.m./BTU by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Continued pressure on oil companies to lower nitrogen oxide emissions has led 
to a number of demonstration projects. One approach involves low-NOX burners. 
The principle is fairly simple. Instead of a hot, large flame over a small 
area, the burner covers a larger surface area enabling it to heat at lower 
temperatures. Chevron said the lower temperature is not high enough to form NOX 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's expensive and we still haven't calculated the cost," refinery General 
Manager Dave O'Reilly said of controls called for during the next five years. 
"But we think most of it is doable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Plan Calls for Major Changes 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has approved a sweeping plan to 
clean up Southern California skies and bring air quality up to federal 
standards by 2007. The proposals would change the way companies do business, 
government agencies operate and individuals go about their daily lives. Two 
proposals, dealing with adhesives and spray paint, already have been adopted by 
the district. Here are the major new requirements called for in the plan: 
</P>
<P>
Industrial 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTER DISCS: 
</P>
<P>
Equipment to capture emissions from chemicals used to coat and clean magnetic 
data storage discs. 
</P>
<P>
FOAM CUPS: 
</P>
<P>
Devices to capture or burn smog-producing reactive organic gases (ROG) produced 
in manufacturing of foam packaging, thermal insulation, cushioning, food 
containers, drinking cups and other foam products. 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTER CHIPS: 
</P>
<P>
Rules to reduce emissions of gases emitted in manufacture of semiconductors by 
using processes already available or by adding pollution-control devices to 
existing manufacturing lines. 
</P>
<P>
ADHESIVES: 
</P>
<P>
New formulas to reduce emissions from solvent-borne adhesives, or the 
substitution of non-solvent- borne adhesives used in making glues, mucilage, 
paste and rubber cement. Solvents are used to transfer the adhesive materials 
to what is being glued and are used mainly in manufacturing cars, airplanes, 
boats and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
PAINTS AND OTHER COATINGS: 
</P>
<P>
Require manufacturers of paint products containing volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) to pay charges to the AQMD based on amount of emissions from each 
product. Proceeds used to finance research and development into low-VOC 
products. 
</P>
<P>
PAPER, FABRIC AND FILM COATING: 
</P>
<P>
Further tighten rules to limit VOC emissions during coating of products such as 
adhesive tapes, book covers, post cards, office copier paper, 
pressure-sensitive tape and vinyl fabric sheets for wall paper. 
</P>
<P>
GRAPHIC ARTS: 
</P>
<P>
Extend current limits on VOC emissions to small firms that emit less than 20 
pounds of VOCs a day. 
</P>
<P>
CLEANUP SOLVENTS: 
</P>
<P>
Extend to all firms rules requiring cleaning solvents to be water-based or to 
emit fewer VOCs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial 
</P>
<P>
AUTO PAINT SHOPS: 
</P>
<P>
Require neighborhood shops, chains, new-car dealers and others to use paint 
that emits fewer smog-producing fumes. New formulas would be required for 
primers, finish coats and solvents used to clean spray-painting equipment and 
new equipment to prevent spray paint from becoming airborne. Currently, no 
rules specifically cover auto paint shops. 
</P>
<P>
LAWN &amp; GARDEN EQUIPMENT: 
</P>
<P>
Require commercial lawn and garden equipment to be electric-powered, or require 
modification of gasoline engines to lower air pollution emissions. Long-range 
proposal calls for methanol-powered engines. 
</P>
<P>
DRY CLEANING: 
</P>
<P>
About 1,760 dry cleaners in South Coast Basin use perchloroethylene, which 
contributes to smog. Dry cleaners would have to use equipment that eliminates 
transfer of clothes from washer to dryer, during which "perc" leaks into air. 
New equipment to capture emissions would be installed, and exemption from rules 
for small dry cleaners would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
CLEAN VEHICLE FLEETS: 
</P>
<P>
Public and private fleets of more than 15 vehicles would be converted to 
cleaner-burning fuels, such as methanol. By the year 2000, 15% to 30% of 
vehicles in these fleets would run on electricity, compressed natural gas, 
methanol, propane and butane. 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS: 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides would be reformulated with regulations on how and when they can be 
applied. Pesticides might be applied in dry form instead of liquid form. When 
spraying is required, nozzles could be redesigned to reduce leakage. 
</P>
<P>
BAKERIES: 
</P>
<P>
Appealing aromas wafting from bakeries come from compounds -- primarily ethanol 
-- that cause air pollution. Officials propose requiring special equipment on 
ovens to reduce the gases. Only bakeries producing more than 100,000 pounds of 
bread per day would be affected by the rule. 
</P>
<P>
BUSES: 
</P>
<P>
Diesel buses emit nitrogen oxides and microscopic particles that reduce 
visibility and contribute to haze. Air quality officials propose converting of 
all or part of the existing transit bus fleet from diesel to cleaner-burning 
fuels. Taking a lead from Seattle, San Francisco and other cities, officials 
also propose replacing diesel buses on frequently traveled routes with electric 
buses or trolleys. 
</P>
<P>
BREWERIES: 
</P>
<P>
Three large breweries and a number of smaller ones turn out more than 18 
million barrels of beer each year -- and in so doing spew ethanol and other 
polluting compounds into the air. Controls would include installation of 
filters to capture pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANTS: 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 restaurants in the basin use char-broilers to cook steaks, 
hamburgers, chicken and other food. Grease falling into flames or high onto 
temperature surfaces creates reactive organic gas and microscopic particles 
that reduce visibility and cause respiratory problems. Proposals would require 
more efficient exhaust hoods on stoves, devices in the hoods to collect 
pollutants and grooved cooking griddles that funnel grease away before it 
burns. 
</P>
<P>
PARKING LOTS: 
</P>
<P>
Impose "parking charges" to discourage single-rider commuters. The new charges 
would be in addition to any parking fees already paid. Employers attracting 
more than 1,000 motor vehicle trips a day (that's 500 vehicles in and out) 
would be responsible for collecting the money and passing it along to the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. The funds would be used to subsidize 
ride-sharing programs and the use of local transit. 
</P>
<P>
COMMUTING: 
</P>
<P>
Require firms employing 25 or more workers to offer incentives to ride-share or 
to use public transit. Currently, firms that employ more than 100 workers are 
required to do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumers 
</P>
<P>
DEODORANTS: 
</P>
<P>
Change product formulas and eliminate certain propellants used in underarm 
antiperspirants and deodorants that contribute to air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER AEROSOLS: 
</P>
<P>
Require new formulas and bans on use of certain reactive aerosol propellants. 
Household products release large amounts of reactive organic compounds into the 
air -- more than oil refineries and equal to 7.5% of ROG from all sources in 
the basin. They include paints, insecticides, cleaning solutions and automotive 
and personal care products. 
</P>
<P>
BARBECUES: 
</P>
<P>
Ban sales of barbecues that use starter fluid, or require that starter fluid 
used to light charcoal, campfires and patio torches be reformulated with less 
smog-producing ingredients. Also, restrict use of starter fluid on heavy summer 
smog days. Starter fluid currently is made of petroleum distillate that 
includes photochemically reactive organic compounds. 
</P>
<P>
WATER HEATERS: 
</P>
<P>
Require installation of solar collectors on all new and replacement 
water-heating systems. Conventional water heaters would be used to back up 
solar collectors. There are 3.3 million natural gas-fired water heaters in the 
basin, with average life-spans of about 10 years. Combustion of the gas gives 
off nitrogen oxides, a major ingredient of photochemical smog. Since 1983, new 
hot water heaters sold in California have had to comply with limits on NOX 
emissions. The solar panels would save about 52% of the energy needed for a 
given water-heating system with an average annual savings of $113 on gas bills. 
A solar panel costs about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
TIRES: 
</P>
<P>
As tires wear, they give off small particulate matter that reduces visibility. 
Proposals would ban sale of bias-ply tires for light-duty passenger vehicles 
and require radial tires, which cost more but last 50% longer. Radial tires 
emit less particulate matter. They also contribute to better gas mileage, which 
reduces engine emissions. 
</P>
<P>
DRIVE-THROUGH LINES: 
</P>
<P>
Cars waiting in drive-through lines at banks and fast-food restaurants account 
for much of the carbon monoxide that spews into the air each day. Emissions go 
up as motorists turn off their engines, then restart them. Proposal would limit 
the number of drive-through facilities and design them to reduce idling time. 
One plan would require two drive-up windows at fast-food restaurants, one for 
paying and one for receiving the food, which some restaurants now use. 
</P>
<P>
VEHICLE REGISTRATION: 
</P>
<P>
There are 5.7 million cars and light-duty trucks in the South Coast Air Basin 
and by 2010 that number is expected to grow to 7 million. Proposals would limit 
the number of cars each household could register. Also reductions in 
registration fees would be given to owners of vehicles using cleaner-burning 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
PLEASURE BOATS: 
</P>
<P>
New outboard and inboard engines sold in the basin would have to meet tougher 
air pollution control standards. Possible measures include installing catalytic 
converters, modifying engines, installing electronic controls and using 
methanol fuel. Vapor recovery systems like double-hoses at gasoline station 
pumps would be required at marinas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government 
</P>
<P>
MUNICIPAL DUMPS: 
</P>
<P>
Garbage and trash buried in landfills decomposes and gives off various gases 
like methane that contribute to smog. Since the early 1980s, landfills have 
been required to collect the gas and burn it off. But this creates other air 
pollutants. New proposals include shipping all trash and garbage out of the 
basin on non-polluting electric trains rather than trucks. 
</P>
<P>
SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS: 
</P>
<P>
Residential and industrial waste water contains volatile organic compounds that 
can vaporize during the treatment process and contribute to smog. One proposal 
limits types and amounts of waste containing VOCs that can be discharged into 
sewer systems. Another calls for new controls at treatment plants to capture 
VOC emissions using carbon canisters and scrubbers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agriculture 
</P>
<P>
LIVESTOCK WASTE: 
</P>
<P>
Decomposing waste releases such volatile organic compounds as methane, ethane 
and ammonia. About 500,000 dairy animals in the basin produce 620,000 tons of 
solid waste each year. Rules may require waste to be rotated frequently and 
exposed to air to limit the production of organic gases. Other proposals 
include hauling it out of the basin, or putting it in tanks to speed formation 
of methane, which can be used to generate electricity.

HEAD OF MEXICO TEACHERS UNION FORCED TO QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The self-described "moral guide" and leader-for-life of the National Education 
Workers Union resigned Sunday under pressure from tens of thousands of 
dissident teachers who have been on a wildcat strike for the last week. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Jonguitud Barrios, head of the teachers union for more than 15 years, is 
the most important head of an official union to depart since the government 
jailed powerful Oil Workers Union boss Joaquin Hernandez Galicia in January. 
</P>
<P>
But while President Carlos Salinas de Gortari gladly took the initiative that 
removed the troublesome oil union leader, he was forced by the striking 
teachers to get rid of Jonguitud. The resignation is a concession from the 
government, which refuses to meet the teachers' demand of a 100% pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
Jonguitud's departure, announced by Salinas' spokesman, appeared timed to stave 
off a national teachers' march scheduled in the capital today. The Mexico City 
bus drivers union has announced it will support the teachers with a daylong 
work stoppage that is likely to make chaos of the already traffic-snarled 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Hernandez, a spokesman for the dissident teachers, said that the march 
would go on as planned and that striking teachers would not obey an order by 
the Federal Arbitration and Conciliation Board to return to work today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Union Triumph' 
</P>
<P>
"The removal of Jonguitud is a great union triumph, but it does not solve the 
fundamental problems of a salary increase and union democracy, particularly in 
(Mexico City) where we (the dissidents) are a majority and have no 
representation," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers earn an average of $150 per month. In addition to the pay raise, the 
dissident faction, called the National Coordinator of Education Workers, is 
demanding authentically free union elections to replace the rest of the union 
leadership controlled by Jonguitud. 
</P>
<P>
Jonguitud was head of the official Revolutionary Vanguard faction of the union 
and a permanent adviser to the full union's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Broke Down 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations among the two factions and the government broke down Friday night. 
The striking teachers have rejected a government offer of a 10% pay boost. 
</P>
<P>
The strike and Jonguitud's resignation present a difficult situation for the 
Salinas government, which is trying to hold inflation under 25% this year and 
to rebuild the battered Institutional Revolutionary Party. The union belongs to 
the PRI, as the ruling party is popularly known. 
</P>
<P>
"Salinas has played a negotiating card (with Jonguitud) because he cannot 
afford to concede any more on salaries," said Carlos Ramirez, a labor and 
economics analyst with the newspaper El Financiero. "If he does, it will throw 
his whole salary policy out of whack along with his agreement with the 
International Monetary Fund." 
</P>
<P>
The government must renegotiate a national wage-and-price-control pact with 
business and labor by the end of July. The latest accord kept wage increases to 
10% for the first seven months of the year, and the government reached a loan 
agreement with the IMF based on these pacts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Try to Keep Control 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will try to keep control of the teachers union 
without Jonguitud. As leader of the union, Jonguitud served as a pillar of the 
PRI. For decades, the union has kept strikes from happening and functioned as a 
machine at election time, turning out votes for the PRI and allegedly assisting 
in electoral fraud where necessary to deliver an edge for the party. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oil Workers Union, the government installed its chosen leader after 
jailing Hernandez Galicia and several of his allies on charges of illegal 
weapons possession, tax evasion and murder. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Oil Workers Union, which also belongs to the PRI, the estimated 
850,000-member teachers union apparently turned out for Salinas in last July's 
presidential election, in which a leftist opposition candidate won an 
unprecedented 30% of the ballots and Salinas polled the lowest vote ever cast 
for a PRI presidential candidate. Jonguitud won a seat in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Dissident teachers charge that Jonguitud is corrupt and has run his union with 
gangster tactics, ordering the killing of scores of teachers who opposed his 
rule. They accuse him of stealing millions of dollars of union money, selling 
union jobs and assigning his cronies to school administration and inspection 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denied Charges 
</P>
<P>
Jonguitud has repeatedly denied such charges publicly. At a press conference 
last week that may have sealed his fate, the union boss sported a gold Rolex 
watch and a silk necktie and announced that any teacher "can aspire to what I 
have if he is involved in national life as I have been." 
</P>
<P>
Dissident union leaders and some labor analysts believe that Jonguitud can 
continue to exercise power over the union through his handpicked section chiefs 
and that his resignation was, as one observer said, "a mere formality." 
</P>
<P>
But labor specialist Raul Trejo noted: "In Mexican politics, form counts for a 
lot and appearances are part of daily political life. Such a high-profile 
resignation, such an important resignation, because it was demanded by the 
teachers, cannot be only cosmetic." 
</P>
<P>
The government has not said what it will do if the teachers ignore its order to 
return to work, but the law says they may be fired after four days of 
unauthorized absence from the job. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the teachers seemed determined to hold out for their other demands. 
Many teachers interviewed last week said they used to be able to live 
reasonably well on the salaries they earned from one job. Now many say they 
hold two teaching posts and still cannot support their families.

The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where 
about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who 
escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel 
docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5. Twenty minutes later, families 
started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning 
sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which 
extends six decks down into the ship. There were 11 survivors inside the 
turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship's 
magazines, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crewmen Stand on Turret 
</P>
<P>
Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened 
turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two 
other turrets. 
</P>
<P>
When the vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers among those on the 
dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Powell F. Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was there to 
greet the vessel. As the ship docked, three Marines raised a flag to half-staff 
at the stern. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters 
were not allowed to talk with the families or crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur 
videotape released by the Navy on Sunday. The tape was made by an officer on 
the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jet of Intense Fire 
</P>
<P>
The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber "bloomers" 
that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and 
thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape cut immediately to damage-control firefighters spraying heavy 
streams of water onto the turret. 
</P>
<P>
Churches throughout the area dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families 
of Iowa crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way," said Cmdr. John L. Fitzgerald, 
a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station. "Our faith helps us 
to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death." 
</P>
<P>
A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the 
names of the dead were taken to the altar. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that 
can accommodate 3,000 people. The families of the victims were invited, but 
Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico. The Pentagon said it 
happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired. 
The guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black 
powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recommissioned by Reagan 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa and its sister ships, the Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were 
commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War. They were 
recommissioned during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that he believes the four battleships 
still "have merit" as weapons in the U.S. arsenal and have a future in the 
modern Navy. On NBC's "Meet the Press," Cheney called the ships "one way to 
supplement" the usefulness of carrier battle groups "in terms of a show of 
force and showing the flag." 
</P>
<P>
"They are effective," he said. "They were relatively cheap to bring back into 
service compared to new ships; they're good cruise missile platforms, so I do 
think they have a role to play. The question is how you do that and how you pay 
for it."

BONN AIDES COMING TO U.S. FOR MISSILE TALKS 
</P>

<P>
West Germany's ministers of foreign affairs and defense will fly to Washington 
today for talks aimed at averting a developing crisis within the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden trip reflects the increasing isolation of the Bonn government from 
its major NATO partners on the twin issues of modernization of short-range 
nuclear missiles and talks with the Soviet Union to limit their numbers. And it 
also underscores what many commentators are calling political confusion and 
panic in Bonn, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl reverses himself on major issues, 
apparently in response to public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
The hastily arranged Washington trip comes only days after a meeting in 
Brussels of NATO defense ministers designed to iron out differences so that a 
scheduled meeting of NATO chiefs of state on May 29-30 can adopt a united 
Western policy in the face of various arms reduction proposals by Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holding Off Decision 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the Brussels meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney agreed 
to defer a decision on deploying a modernized version of the Lance short-range 
nuclear missile until after West Germany's elections in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cheney repeated the NATO view that the Western alliance should not 
enter talks with the Soviets on the issue of short-range nuclear forces at this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
But back in Bonn, Kohl finally realized that he faces a fight for his political 
life, with opinion polls running heavily against his coalition government of 
conservative Christian Democrats and Christian Socialists and the more liberal 
Free Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
A day after Cheney left Brussels, Bonn's governing coalition drew up a decision 
paper, scheduled to be made public this week, spelling out fresh policies and 
calling for talks with the Soviets on short-range missiles in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
This proviso was inserted at the insistence of Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher, who reportedly threatened to break up the governing coalition if the 
decision paper did not include a call for talks with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Kohl has expressed a commitment to upgrading the aging Lance 
missiles and his opposition to immediate East-West talks on short-range 
missiles. His turnaround has left Washington, London and the other NATO 
capitals in a quandary over what is the official government position here. 
</P>
<P>
Most conservative commentators here argue that Kohl has caved in to Genscher 
because opinion polls show that West Germans favor reducing the number of 
short-range missiles based here. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has also angered NATO officials by reneging on his pledge to lengthen 
military conscription from 15 to 18 months of service as a way of keeping the 
West German army at full strength in the face of a declining population.

HUSSEIN BACK IN JORDAN TO FACE WORST CRISIS IN YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

AMMAN, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
King Hussein returned to Jordan on Sunday to confront his most serious internal 
political crisis in nearly 20 years after riots over price increases spread 
across the kingdom last week. 
</P>
<P>
The country remained calm Sunday, with no outbursts of violence reported since 
Friday night. However, police and troops were still out in force in Maan, Salt, 
Karak and several other towns and villages where the rioting, touched off by 
sharp price increases, erupted Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who canceled a planned visit to Britain to fly home directly from his 
trip to the United States, conferred with his Cabinet ministers Sunday amid 
widespread expectations that he will address the nation within the next few 
days on economic and political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"His presence at home should initially have a calming effect, but the king will 
have to act soon to address the issues raised by the riots and to demonstrate 
his concern," a senior Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The rioting, in which at least eight people were killed and more than 100 
injured, was the worst civil unrest in the tiny kingdom since Palestinian 
guerrillas were expelled from Jordan in 1970-1971 after heavy fighting with the 
Jordanian army. 
</P>
<P>
While price increases, commodity shortages and other signs of the economic 
austerity gripping Jordan touched off the riots, the protests quickly assumed a 
more complex political profile. Calls to rescind the price increases escalated 
into demands for more democracy and for the ouster of the government of Prime 
Minister Zaid Rifai. 
</P>
<P>
"The price increases were only the spark. What people . . . were saying in the 
end is that they want a better and more participatory government. They took to 
the streets to say this because without political parties, a free press or any 
other legitimate channels for dissent, violence was the only way to get the 
message across," a Jordanian business executive, who is close to the royal 
family, said. 
</P>
<P>
For King Hussein, the message was particularly disturbing because it came from 
the "Transjordanian" quarters of his kingdom, from the Bedouin and other native 
East Bank areas that traditionally have been the bedrock of the monarchy's 
support. 
</P>
<P>
For years now, Jordan's extensive internal security apparatus has closely 
watched the Palestinians, who make up between 30% and 50% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the temptation some analysts have felt to draw comparisons with the 
intifada, the Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule in the neighboring West 
Bank, no Palestinians were involved in the East Bank protests. That may explain 
why Amman, the mostly Palestinian-populated capital of Jordan, had no violence 
during the past week. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a purely Transjordanian protest," a Western diplomat noted. "The 
intifada doesn't enter into it except insofar as watching the protests in the 
West Bank on television every night may have given the kids on the East Bank 
ideas of their own." 
</P>
<P>
As the protests spread up the spine of Jordan, the oft-recurring refrains heard 
on the streets were those demanding Rifai's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
While the prime minister is widely held responsible for the deficit spending 
that helped to bring on Jordan's current economic crisis, it also appears that 
he is being turned into a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
"The demonstrators were expressing economic and political frustrations. They 
were saying they don't want to be governed in this way," said Fahed Fanek, a 
prominent East Bank businessman. "But no one wants to destroy Jordan, no one is 
against the monarchy. That is why everything was concentrated on the head of 
the prime minister and why the king was spared. Because the prime minister is 
not Jordan. The king is Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's price increases -- of 20% to 50% on a number of commodities -- are 
part of an agreement recently reached with the International Monetary Fund to 
reschedule part of Jordan's $6-billion foreign debt. This year's IMF targets 
call for increasing government revenues by $67.25 million and cutting 
expenditures by $32.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Parliament 
</P>
<P>
As for political reform, Hussein recently approved a law opening the way for 
the election of a new Parliament to replace the one that was dissolved last 
year when Jordan announced it was severing ties with the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Jordanian intellectuals interviewed over the last few days said 
they hoped that convulsions of the past week would persuade Hussein to loosen 
political and press restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson of last week is that there has to be some way of expressing an 
opinion in this country without throwing rocks or burning cars," a prominent 
East Bank economist said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATION IN CRISIS 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein met with his Cabinet to discuss rioting in several towns 
touched off by sharp price increases. At least eight were killed.

ARAFAT TO MEET WITH MITTERRAND IN HIS 1ST OFFICIAL VISIT TO FRANCE

<P>
PLO leader Yasser Arafat will pay his first official visit to France in May for 
talks with President Francois Mitterrand, Foreign Affairs Minister Roland Dumas 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government and most French Jews were bitter about the decision to 
receive someone they regard as a terrorist, and protest demonstrations are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand had previously declared his intention to meet Arafat in France this 
year. Dumas, in a radio interview, confirmed that the visit will take place in 
"the first days of May. It is an official visit since it has been organized by 
the head of state." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat came to France last year, but as a guest of the European Parliament in 
the eastern city of Strasbourg. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization's drive for international respectability 
has gathered speed since last December when it recognized Israel's right to 
exist and rejected terrorism. Arafat has met the Pope and Western European 
leaders, but the official visit to France, one of the permanent members of the 
U.N. Security Council, represents a major diplomatic coup. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas was at pains to reassure France's Jewish community, whose 500,000 members 
make it the largest in Europe outside the Soviet Union. "(The Jewish community) 
knows that France has always been the close friend of Israelis. . . . But we 
think that at the same time we must take into account the reality of the 
Palestinian people." 
</P>
<P>
The visit also disturbed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. "I take a grave 
view of this," he told Israel Radio.

A 10-year-old boy was buried waist-high in more than 2,000 pounds of bricks 
when a chimney collapsed, but police said he was not seriously injured and was 
in stable condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The chimney, all that was left of a house formerly on a lot where the boy was 
playing, collapsed Saturday, apparently because the boy and a friend were 
beating on it with sticks, police said. It took rescuers about 20 minutes to 
free the boy, who suffered a fractured thighbone.

REAGAN'S IRAN-CONTRA ROLE CLEARER, MITCHELL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine, asserting Sunday that the 
Oliver L. North trial has indicated that former President Ronald Reagan was 
implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal more than was known previously, called it 
probable that "history will render the final verdict" on his role. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling investigations by Congress and the presidential commission headed by 
former Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.), along with the just-concluded trial testimony, 
Mitchell said that "at each stage of the process in which more information has 
been made available, President Reagan's involvement becomes clearer and more 
deep." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell dismissed the Tower board's portrait of Reagan as a benign, uninvolved 
figure. "That was clearly in error," he said, "viewed now with the benefit of 
hindsight." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell stopped short of calling for reopening the congressional investigation 
into the scandal but cited "serious questions about the document-producing 
process," repeating his vow to seek a congressional inquiry to find out why the 
1987 congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra scandal did not see 
certain White House documents that showed up at North's trial. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to look into it and will," said Mitchell, who was on the Senate's 
Iran-Contra panel. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's comments, made during an interview on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," 
came as jurors in the North trial took Sunday off. They resume deliberations 
today. 
</P>
<P>
North, a former Marine and former White House aide, faces 12 felony counts 
centering on charges that he lied to Congress about secret efforts to aid the 
Nicaraguan rebels and blocked investigations of his activities. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell complained that versions of documents provided to the committees did 
not contain handwritten and typed notations by President Reagan linking him to 
the illegal aid efforts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one North memo to Reagan outlined what the President should say 
about a "quid pro quo" during a 1985 telephone call to Roberto Suazo Corazon, 
then president of Honduras. Reagan's handwritten notes on the memo indicated 
that Suazo agreed to support the Contras in exchange for secret U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
Another document, Mitchell said, bore the typed notation, "Carbon copy to the 
vice president," a reference to George Bush. "That notation did not appear on 
the documents provided to the committee." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has contended that the committees did not get the documents 
because the FBI failed to deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell allowed that "anyone can make human error" but he added: "It's 
difficult, however, to understand how oversight could account for the receipt 
by the committees of documents in one form and then another form that is a more 
detailed form going to the court." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all his misgivings and dissatisfactions, Mitchell acknowledged in 
response to a question that the matter of Reagan's involvement may be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that may be the ultimate result," he said. "Sure, and history will render 
the final verdict."

Four colorful balloons rose into the desert sky at dawn Sunday in a belated 
start of the Gordon Bennett distance race in hopes that high-altitude wind 
currents will carry them into the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 people watched as the first helium balloon, the bright yellow Rosie 
O'Grady, floated up from Ruth Hardy Park at 6:45 a.m., about 10 hours after 
gusty winds forced officials to scrub Saturday night's scheduled departure. 
</P>
<P>
The other three balloons took off over the next hour. Competitors dumped sand 
ballast to reach the 12,000-foot level and catch easterly winds of 30 m.p.h. to 
40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The race is won by the balloon that travels the farthest, regardless of where 
it lands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regret Delay 
</P>
<P>
Race officials said they regretted delaying the launch until morning because 
balloonists were forced to blow out precious helium expanding in the warmer 
daytime air. A nighttime launch preserves the cool, contracted gas. 
</P>
<P>
"If we would have launched last night we would have gotten more distance," said 
race director Tom Heinsheimer. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the gusts of 25 m.p.h. Saturday night left him no choice but to 
decide at 9 p.m. on the postponement. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a look at the situation and decided it wasn't safe," Heinsheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the daytime launch, the winning balloon still could travel perhaps 
1,000 miles, landing sometime Monday night as far away as Kansas or Nebraska, 
said meteorologist Carl Garczynski of the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The record in the modern era of the race is 1,346 miles, set in 1981 by pilots 
Ben Abruzzo and Rocky Aoki. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Strategy 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, three-time race winner Joe Kittenger, flying the Rosie O'Grady with 
co-pilot Sherry Reed, used the most aggressive launch strategy, dumping large 
amounts of sand ballast to quickly reach the altitude of the strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
Jura, piloted by Karl Spenger of Switzerland with co-pilot Ronald Schuler, was 
next to take off, followed by Destiny carrying pilot Don Davis, an architect 
from Long Beach, and co-pilot Ron Martin. 
</P>
<P>
The last balloon to take off was Benihana, piloted by Aoki, founder of the 
Benihana of Tokyo restaurant chain, with co-pilot George Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday evening, it was difficult to determine which balloon was leading the 
race. Just over six hours after lifting off, the Rosie O'Grady reported in over 
Kingman, Ariz., about 125 miles east of Palm Springs, headed northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Jura was last heard from at dusk, northwest of Flagstaff, Ariz., which is about 
300 miles from Palm Springs. She reported an altitude of 12,000 feet but gave 
no heading. Destiny had not been heard from since shortly after noon about a 
mile south of Parker, Ariz. Benihana was last reported 30 miles southwest of 
Parker and drifting northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Parker and Kingman are both about 125 miles from Palm Springs, but Kingman is 
about 75 miles farther north. Race organizers rely on reports from balloon 
chase crews for updates on locations and communication can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The race, named for New York Herald publisher Gordon Bennett, was inaugurated 
in 1906 when Bennett offered a prize to the balloonist who could float the 
greatest distance from a given point.

A fire killed at least 19 people Sunday in an illegal Taiwan video theater, the 
flames blocking the only escape route and trapping customers in tiny viewing 
booths, state-run radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze quickly engulfed the maze-like theater in Chungli, northern Taiwan, 
where patrons were watching videotaped films in private plywood cubicles. Video 
theaters, where customers select their own videotapes of pirated U.S. movies 
for viewing in cubicles, are common in Taiwan.

Poland's Communist Party is dropping the traditional May Day parade in Warsaw 
this year because party members complained it was too long, boring and 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
It will be replaced by a rally in a central square lasting no more than 40 
minutes, followed by folk dancing, fairs and sports, the party daily Trybuna 
Ludu said over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the independent Solidarity trade union, restored to legality last 
week after a seven-year ban, has received permission to hold its own parade in 
a northern district of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The official May Day parades, long a major event in the Communist calendar, 
lasted more than three hours. Tens of thousands marched through the streets 
behind party leaders and the event was televised live. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time now, and in particular last year, the Warsaw party committee 
has received letters expressing doubts about the traditional way of celebrating 
May Day," Trybuna Ludu said.

TOWNSFOLK PACKAGE A SNACK OF POTATO CHIP LORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody ate potato chips Sunday when Monterey Park commemorated the woman who 
was once called the Potato Chip Queen of the West. 
</P>
<P>
The fare was strictly coffee and cake at the celebration of Laura Scudder Day. 
Louise Davis, the city treasurer and president of the local historical society, 
never got a response, she said, to the request she wrote to Laura Scudder Foods 
in Orange to contribute potato chips to the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. The snack food company today has little connection with its founder. 
And, as of this year, the firm's potato chips aren't even made in California. 
</P>
<P>
But decades ago, Scudder parlayed her home-grown potato chip business in 
Monterey Park into a multimillion-dollar empire spanning California, Nevada, 
Arizona and Oregon. And so, in a suburban city whose historical roots don't go 
much deeper than the trees planted in the housing tracts there after World War 
I, Monterey Park laid claim Sunday to its foremost local hero. 
</P>
<P>
Never has such a day been celebrated for any other native of the San Gabriel 
Valley community. More than 100 former employees, city officials, children and 
grandchildren of Laura C. Scudder gathered at the Garvey Ranch Park historical 
museum to praise the no-nonsense entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a woman in business, ahead of her time," said City Treasurer Davis. "I 
can just imagine what she had to go through." 
</P>
<P>
Several factors prompted the Monterey Park Historical Society to honor Scudder. 
Eighteen months ago, John Scudder of Hermosa Beach decided to make a film about 
his grandmother. He recently completed a 53-minute color video entitled 
"Laura." 
</P>
<P>
A studio photographer by trade, he said he began the "Laura" project "to 
preserve the story before it blew away." Age 12 when his grandmother died, he 
said: "I thought I knew her story pretty well. But I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The film was the centerpiece of the celebration. The historical society also 
presented plaques to the Scudder family members, who last year gave $15,000 to 
the historical society to fund scholarships for graduates of Alhambra High 
School, which Scudder's children attended. 
</P>
<P>
The video, with interviews of family and former employees, detailed the story 
John Scudder discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Working from a dusty parcel that she and her husband bought on the corner of 
Garvey Avenue and Atlantic Boulevard, Laura Scudder started her business in 
1926 at the suggestion of a friend. She based her operations in a brick 
building next to her home and the gas station she and her husband ran. 
</P>
<P>
Previously they had rented the building to a barber who, in those Prohibition 
days, turned out to be a bootlegger. Scudder, a Republican and an Episcopalian, 
kicked out the bootlegger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Reason to Succeed 
</P>
<P>
She had another motivation to sell potato chips: to support her family. She had 
four children, and her husband's health failed after a car fell on him at the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"She was an instigator and doer," says Joseph R. Blackstock, a former president 
of the Monterey Park Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Scudder was a big woman whose trademark was wide, flat-brimmed hats. 
Advertisements showed photographs of her in hat and gloves, a purse under her 
arm. Her signature followed ad copy with recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Scudder was born in Philadelphia in 1881. Her mother died when she was 2 and 
she was raised by her father, a baker and butcher. As a young adult, she went 
to nursing school because she could not afford medical school. Eventually she 
married one of her patients, who was a farmer and inventor, and moved in with 
in-laws. But she grew tired of this situation. With her trunk packed, she told 
her husband one day in 1910: "I'm going West." He decided to go with her. 
</P>
<P>
First in Seattle and later in Northern California, they struggled to escape 
poverty that was so bad, as Laura once wrote, "we didn't have a nickel even to 
buy a little doll" for their children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Venture Into Law 
</P>
<P>
In Ukiah, she and her husband ran a restaurant across from the courthouse. She 
asked her courthouse customers how she could become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
After reading from borrowed law books, she traveled by train to Sacramento to 
take the Bar exam when she was four months pregnant. She easily passed, 
becoming the first woman lawyer in Ukiah history. 
</P>
<P>
In 1920, a time when many people were coming to the developing Los Angeles 
area, the Scudders decided to try their luck in Monterey Park, which was a 
20-minute trolley ride from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
When Scudder first went into business, she could not get insurance for the 
firm's one delivery truck. She was told that as a woman she couldn't be relied 
upon to pay premiums. So she found a woman insurance agent in Los Angeles who 
eventually got the business of insuring hundreds of Scudder trucks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1928, Scudder went ahead with plans to build another plant in Oakland, even 
though her first husband had died that year. 
</P>
<P>
During the Depression she gave work to those no one else would help -- 
housewives. In their homes, they fashioned waxed-paper bags for the potato 
chips, ironing three sides of the bags before they were taken back to the plant 
to be filled and sealed. Previously, when chips were sold in markets in the 
early 20th Century, they were dispensed from glass cases into paper bags and 
quickly became stale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figured Every Angle 
</P>
<P>
To ensure the freshness of the dairy products in her Scudder's mayonnaise, she 
bought a ranch on Workman Mill Road, near today's intersection of the San 
Gabriel River and Pomona freeways, where she raised chickens and cows. "It was 
a little unfair to say she did it all," Blackstock said, noting that her 
children and relatives also helped. "But it was her business, period." 
</P>
<P>
By 1953, when she opened a plant in Fresno, the company had 1,000 employees and 
about 50% of the California potato chip market. For decades, it was the only 
large business in Monterey Park. The firm moved to Anaheim in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Scudder sold the business in 1957, two years before she died. Since then, the 
company has changed hands three times, including its most recent sale in 1987 
to Borden Inc. for $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
After her death, Laura Scudder faded from public memory. There is little 
evidence today that she even existed beyond the name on potato chip bags and 
peanut butter jars. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who paused Sunday to remember Scudder said they wished there was 
something left to honor her. Said Blackstock: "She lacked what most humans 
have: those gremlins that say, 'I can't do it.' I just regret there are no 
statues, no streets, no schools named in her honor in Monterey Park."

An anti-allergy drug due on pharmacy shelves in June has been linked to the 
deaths of babies and should be restricted to prescriptions, a private health 
watchdog group said. 
</P>
<P>
"Researchers in Belgium, where it is available over the counter, have 
associated the drug with sudden infant death syndrome, and in subsequent 
research found it to cause obstruction of the airways during sleep in infants," 
the nonprofit Public Citizen Health Research Group said. 
</P>
<P>
The group asked the government to reverse a decision allowing non-prescription 
sales of a common anti-allergy drug called Phenergan, made by Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The group said it was petitioning the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban 
non-prescription sales, and it said its petition was supported by the Maryland 
SIDS Institute and six prominent SIDS researchers. 
</P>
<P>
SIDS kills an estimated 5,000 American babies each year, but its cause is 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Wyeth-Ayerst spokesman Audrey Ashby said the FDA reviewed all test data in 
making its decision to allow the drug to be sold without a prescription. "We're 
satisfied the products are suitable," Ashby said.

A drug developed in Israel that showed promise in treating multiple sclerosis 
does not appear effective against the most severe form of the disease, 
researchers said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, called Copolymer I, may be of value for a less-devastating form of 
the disease, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Miller, director of neurology at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, 
said a study using the drug on 106 patients with chronic, progressive multiple 
sclerosis -- the worst form of the disease -- showed "no evidence that the drug 
is an effective treatment" for such patients. His findings were presented at 
the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. 
</P>
<P>
The drug has been used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis in Israel for 
several years but has not been approved for general use in the United States.

HENLEY'S 'ABUNDANCE' GOES WEST WITH A NEW-FOUND MATURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is irony in the title "Abundance," Beth Henley's new play that opened 
over the weekend at South Coast Repertory -- a good sign. There is also humor, 
surprise and anguish, which, in descending order, are more predictable stamps 
of Henley's work. But what "Abundance" offers in greatest abundance is a new 
maturity. This new piece is Henley's most sober-sided play. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is the kookiness of the three sisters in "Crimes of the Heart" or the 
riotous Southern Gothic caricatures of "The Miss Firecracker Contest." 
"Abundance" is also Henley's most undisguised play, examining life's promises 
and shattered dreams among 4 1/2 people: Two mail-order brides, their 
respective husbands and a half-character, "Professor" Elmore Crome, who 
exploits some of the events in their story, pivotally altering its course. 
</P>
<P>
We're in the latter half of the 19th Century in the Wyoming Territory. Macon 
Hill (Belita Moreno) and Bess Johnson (O-Lan Jones) have traveled West, 
practicing all the distance how to say "I do" to men they've never seen, who 
sent them partial fare, and whom they're willing to marry -- until they catch 
sight of them, or of their closest approximation. 
</P>
<P>
In Bess' case, it's the closest approximation. The man who'd sent for her has 
inconsiderately choked and died on a piece of corn bread. She's wed instead to 
his reluctant brother Jack (Bruce Wright), a self-centered, trigger-happy 
roustabout with a talent for failure who'll try anything once. Macon's man, 
Will Curtis (Jimmie Ray Weeks), is steady as they come -- a very good, very 
dull one-eyed widower to whom Macon finds herself instantly unattracted. 
</P>
<P>
Macon's the daredevil, Bess the wimp. Macon wants to write a novel, "see the 
elephant," make something of herself. She even suggests to the struggling Bess 
that they should run away together, in search of real adventure. But timid (and 
intimidated) Bess is content to dodge her husband's bullets and demeaning 
words, until a severe winter and starvation finds them rescued by the more 
prosperous Macon and Will. 
</P>
<P>
What happens next goes well beyond the wildest adventure Macon had in mind, 
except that it happens to Bess. It is the pivot of the story and won't be 
repeated here. Let's say the tables start to turn. Relationships intertwine, 
people change, enemies become lovers, friends become enemies, life's blows and 
blessings turn wildly capricious, transformations occur. 
</P>
<P>
While "Abundance" starts out as the tale of two well-intentioned women's lives 
(the play covers a 25-year span up from the 1860s), it covers a good deal more 
philosophical ground than that. Aside from the changing fortunes of Bess and 
Macon, there are the changing ones of Will and, to a lesser degree, Jack. Weeks 
makes Will a surprisingly appealing fellow, unglamorous perhaps, but a man who 
knows right from wrong, even if he's a bit clumsy in other areas of his life. 
Wright is equally on track with the diametrically opposite Jack, a vivid 
bounder with lots of sex appeal and a dim sense of loyalty -- except to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Director Ron Lagomarsino has kept these distinctions and dimensions clear. As 
with the men, he has seen to it that the women, in a potentially tricky 
sequence of events, are full-blooded. Bess and Macon make the play's largest 
transitions and Jones and Moreno deliver them in full measure. Jones has the 
more complex trajectory, from the silly, frightened girl stranded on a station 
platform to the formidable woman she becomes at Elmore Crome's flattering 
instigations. (John Walcutt plays Crome with a restraint becoming to this 
semicharacter that could so easily have been rendered as a cartoon.) 
</P>
<P>
There are minor loopholes in Act II, where mildly improbable events follow one 
another in lightning-quick succession. A verbal reference to "syphilitic" 
markings on Macon's face in the next-to-last scene implies a life course for 
which we have been given no compass. What exactly Jack's role has become in 
Bess' later life is equally unclear. He obviously has prospered by hanging 
around her, though why she would tolerate him at that point, let alone reward 
his betrayals, is perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Henley's point is precisely that one cannot expect linear logic from 
life. A final scene of reconciliation between the women would seem to bear that 
out. It is the play's most moving moment, if more truncated than one would 
want. For once, less is just less when it should be more. 
</P>
<P>
These minor bleeps notwithstanding, "Abundance" remains Henley's most 
thoughtful and accomplished, if not necessarily most colorful, play to date. 
Production values at South Coast are appropriately subdued and spare. Adrianne 
Lobel, Robert Wodjewoski, Paulie Jenkins and Michael Roth did the sets, 
costumes, lighting and music/sound respectively.

A monument to Louis J.M. Daguerre, the Frenchman who discovered the earliest 
practical system of photography, the daguerreotype, has been unveiled outside 
the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery and National Museum of 
American Art. The 12-foot-high, 23-ton granite-and-bronze monument was 
originally presented to the American people in 1890 by the Professional 
Photographers of America, which is sponsoring in part the relocation and 
rededication in honor of the 150th anniversary of the invention of photography.

Singer Carly Simon will open an art gallery in New York on May 2 with a benefit 
exhibition featuring three of her favorite artists. Riverrun Gallery, which 
shares its name with Simon's Oscar-winning hit single, "Let the River Run," 
will donate funds from the opening to the Hazelden Foundation in Minneapolis 
and the Assn. to Benefit Children in New York. Hazelden is a nonprofit drug and 
alcohol rehabilitation center; the Assn. to Benefit Children takes care of 
children who are homeless or afflicted with AIDS. The gallery is expected to 
put on four shows per year. The debut exhibition will feature artists from 
Martha's Vineyard, where Simon has a home. Claudia Puig and ALEENE MacMINN

A.C. Nielsen Co. is inches from beating out Arbitron Ratings Co. for a more 
than $30-million, multiyear contract to upgrade TV ratings measurement of 
Latino households for the all-Spanish Univision and Telemundo networks. "It 
will probably be Nielsen, but no contract has been signed," said Doug Darfield, 
vice president of research for Univision. "You can agree in principle, but once 
you start poring over contract documents, many things can happen. It's in the 
hands of the lawyers." When and if negotiations are finalized, he said, Nielsen 
will install People Meters in about 1,000 Latino households in Los Angeles and 
other cities nationwide. The new service won't be fully operational until 1991.

United States, 1988, 131 minutes

 One good, one not-so. The weaker entry, "Illusory Thoughts," shows 
writer-director-star Patrick Chu, a Hong Kong-born choreographer, as the 
pensive Nam, wandering around Manhattan, ruminating ruefully on how ephemeral 
life is, while various women fight over him. Leo Rubinfein's "The Money 
Juggler" is a well-acted, well-shot, intelligent adaptation of a Louis 
Auchincloss short story.MICHAEL WILMINGTON

'Venus Trap' 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, 1988, 107 minutes 
</P>
<P>
6:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest film by West German sex-and-society phantasmagorist Robert Van 
Ackeren ("A Woman in Flames") is weird indeed: like a fancy porno film in which 
all the sex has been removed, jumping from one tease to the next. We wander in 
and out of the fantasies of an ever-ready young doctor smirking and 
consummating his prodigious lusts all around the city. Its theme is the rebirth 
of romance in the teeth of desperation, or sex-as-calculated-rebellion, but Van 
Ackeren may have over-calculated, this time. How much teasing we can take?

A CHILLING VISION IN 'PET SEMATARY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Pet Sematary" (citywide) finds Stephen King at his farthest out, never more 
simultaneously compelling and repelling, but there's no denying that in Mary 
Lambert he has a director who can go the distance and make the contradiction 
work. No doubt King's multitudinous fans will have flocked to the film on 
opening weekend, but it's going to be fascinating to see if -- or how soon -- 
backlash sets in. 
</P>
<P>
There's a big difference between that which is depicted on the printed page and 
on the big screen, and movies -- so far -- haven't gotten much more gruesome or 
disturbing than "Pet Sematary." 
</P>
<P>
The film is Americana at its most Gothic, a depiction of a normal family made 
vulnerable by the eternal yearning to cheat death. It cuts to the deepest human 
emotions, and there certainly are going to be many people who aren't going to 
be willing or able to take it. "Pet Sematary" is one of the most numbing 
mainstream American movies since "The Exorcist." 
</P>
<P>
The Creeds and their new home, a warmly decorated simple Victorian in rural 
Maine, seem straight off the pages of Better Homes and Gardens. The father, 
Louis (Dale Midkiff), is a Chicago doctor who has taken a position at the 
nearby college. He has a devoted wife, Rachel (Denise Crosby), and the 
requisite two children, Ellie (Blaze Berdahl) and Gage (Miko Hughes), still a 
toddler. 
</P>
<P>
Their picture isn't quite magazine-perfect right from the start. Although the 
Creeds' house is nicely situated on a rise with a lovely lake to its back, it's 
awfully close to the highway, which gets a great deal of noisy and dangerous 
truck traffic. The Creeds' elderly neighbor Jud (Fred Gwynne), who has lived 
his entire life in a seedy house directly across the way, tells them that the 
trucks have over the years exacted a terrible toll of animals, especially dogs 
and cats. Jud shows them a hidden, nearby burial ground, a ramshackle, slightly 
sinister area with homemade gravestones and crosses bearing a rickety sign 
reading "Pet Sematary." But what about that old Indian burial ground that lies 
beyond the pet cemetery? 
</P>
<P>
With only one feature under her belt -- and a much-maligned one at that, 
"Siesta" -- but various commercials and key music videos behind her, Lambert 
goes for strong, succinct images and never stops to worry whether there's a 
lack of credibility or motivation. 
</P>
<P>
The actors, mainly from TV and none of them possessed with a sexy, glamorous 
movie-star aura, couldn't be more aptly cast. As in the recent "Disorganized 
Crime," Gwynne is the anchoring presence as a classically dry, laconic New 
Englander who seems to know some terrible secret. Elliot Goldenthal has 
composed a helpfully ominous score, as moody as vintage Bernard Herrmann, and 
Peter Stein's cinematography is superbly varied, from the bright hues of a 
glossy magazine to the dark shadows of the charnel house. No question about it, 
"Pet Sematary" (rated R for extreme violence) is a handsomely produced film. 
</P>
<P>
You could say facetiously the moral of the story is to avoid buying a house too 
close to the highway. In a very real way that is King's point, which is that 
all it takes is a simple misjudgment to unleash the forces of destruction.

'SCORPION' ANYTHING BUT STINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Red Scorpion" (citywide) is a numskull live-action comic book designed to show 
off a stolid Dolph Lundgren as a super-hero. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Arne Olsen and director Joseph Zito would have us believe that Lundgren 
is a Soviet assassin dispatched to an Angolalike African nation to kill the 
leader of a rebellion against oppressive Soviet-led Cuban forces. (The leader, 
played by South African actor Ruben Nthodi, is reportedly based on Jonas 
Savimbi, a pro-Western leader of an Angolan guerrilla movement and ally of 
South Africa.) It scarcely requires a crystal ball to predict that Lundgren's 
Nikolai, "the perfect killing machine," will undergo a change of heart and 
realize who the true oppressors are. 
</P>
<P>
The film makers aren't actually all that interested in the plight of the 
citizens of the fictional Mombaka. (They, in fact, weathered much adverse 
publicity from anti-apartheid groups for filming in Namibia and for obtaining 
from South Africa the military equipment seen in the picture.) The idea is to 
put Nikolai through the same kind of severe muscle-flexing test of his strength 
and courage that Steve Reeves used to endure in his spear-and-sandal epics. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren is not without humor, and he reveals a surprisingly engaging smile. 
However, films like "Red Scorpion" (rated R for language and heavy violence) 
are in the long run likely to hinder rather than further his career. KEVIN

CHARGERS GET TEXAS TECH QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First things second. The Chargers, a team that needs a quarterback more than 
Capone needed a lawyer, got one Sunday in the second round of the National 
Football League draft. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Billy Joe Tolliver from Texas Tech. And, said Charger Coach Dan 
Henning, "He has the strongest arm in the draft." 
</P>
<P>
"A rocket arm," said Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," Henning added, "I'm not interested in doing anything else (at 
quarterback) as we go into training camp in July." 
</P>
<P>
To get Tolliver, the Chargers traded a third-, a fourth- and a seventh-round 
pick in this draft to the Giants in exchange for the 51st pick, which they 
spent on Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
Henning promised Tolliver a shot at competing for the starting job next season. 
And he talked about Tolliver's charisma. He stopped just short of saying the 
job was owed to Billy Joe. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Tolliver promised to compete for the job. "I'm not gonna go out 
there and lay down," he said. "I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost in the shuffle was the Chargers' first-round choice, a Catholic kid 
from Philadelphia named Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
Burt Grossman is a defensive end from the University of Pittsburgh who played 
outside linebacker in the Blue-Gray game. 
</P>
<P>
He is rich boy from Philadelphia's Main Line, the son of a wealthy businessman. 
But according to Charger scout Steve Schnall, he is a "lunch-pail guy." 
</P>
<P>
He is the half-brother of Margo Adams, the ex-girlfriend of baseball player 
Wade Boggs. He is also the guy the Chargers selected with the eighth pick 
overall Sunday when trade talks with several other teams, including the Chicago 
Bears, fell through. The Bears were looking to unload quarterback Jim McMahon. 
The Chargers showed an interest. But, said Bear Coach Mike Ditka, "if one team 
wants an orchard for an apple tree, it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
Henning didn't buy Ditka's assessment of the trade talks. "Maybe there's been a 
forest fire in the orchard," Henning said. Henning's point was the value of the 
injury-prone McMahon has dropped like a rock. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the Chargers picked a player in Grossman who many people believe 
is a fruit cake. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer is not one of those people. "I love his personality," Ortmayer said. 
Ortmayer said the reason the Chargers used the full 15 minutes allotted to 
making a first-round pick was because they couldn't reach Grossman by phone. It 
was busy. "If we hadn't gotten through, we would have picked him anyway," 
Ortmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also picked Rice center Courtney Hall in the second round (37th 
overall) and Elliot Smith, a defensive back from Alcorn State in the fifth 
round (120th overall). Rounds six through 12 will take place today. Grossman, 
it turns out, is many things to many people. 
</P>
<P>
Before the draft, there were whispers that Grossman had tested positive for 
traces of steroids at the college combine workouts in Indianapolis last 
January. "I will not comment on that because I have no knowledge of that," 
Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
"I look more like a basketball player than a football player," said the 6-6, 
270-pound Grossman, dismissing the steroid rumors with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman didn't arrive in San Diego until late Sunday night but he was already 
playing catch-up with with local women's-rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
It's kind of complicated to explain why. But Grossman is a complicated person. 
Schnall says Grossman's father has been married several times, which is why, 
Schnall says, Grossman craves attention and has treated certain coaches like 
surrogates for the full-time mother he never had. 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Pittsburgh, Grossman kept a boa constrictor in his room. 
He also had a pet pit bull named "Bernie" after New York subway vigilante 
Bernhard Goetz. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, when the subject of his pets came up after the Chargers made Grossman 
the eighth player selected, he said he had gotten rid of them all. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I'll probably get a dog in San Diego. Either a dog or get 
married. There's less aggravation with a dog. To get rid of a dog, you take it 
to the SPCA and it doesn't get half your money." 
</P>
<P>
Is Burt Grossman really a gross man? A Pitt bull? 
</P>
<P>
"Actually he likes to be around adults more than he does being around guys his 
own age," Schnall said. "Sometimes he acts like he's 40." 
</P>
<P>
Gunther Cunningham, the Chargers' defensive line coach, found this out when he 
spent six hours, one-on-one, with Grossman April 13. "Everybody has a 
stereotype of the defensive lineman who can't do anything but grunt," 
Cunningham said. "But Grossman is not typical." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a smart guy who could have made a career on Wall Street if he wanted," 
said Schnall. 
</P>
<P>
Both Cunningham and Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn acknowledged the 
Chargers already have two proven defensive ends in Leslie O'Neal and Lee 
Williams. But they also said it would be no problem getting all three -- 
O'Neal, Grossman and Williams -- on the field at the same time. Grossman, for 
instance, can play inside. 
</P>
<P>
Henning put it this way: "I don't think there is any team in baseball, that if 
they had two .350 hitters, wouldn't take another. I don't care that there's a 
perception that we might be too strong at that position. There are areas on 
your football team that you collect great players." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman was a shotputter at Archbishop Carroll High School in Bala Cynwyd, 
Pa., who impressed scouts with his 30-inch vertical leap, a 4.65 second 
clocking in the 40-yard dash and bench press of 410 pounds. He was the 
top-rated defensive lineman in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, starting for Pitt at left end, Grossman led a pass rush that limited 
Maryland quarterback Dan Henning Jr. to two completions in 10 attempts. He 
sacked Henning twice although Pitt lost, 10-7. Point being: Dan Henning Jr. is 
the son of Grossman's new coach, Dan Henning Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Hall won't be 21 until August and was the youngest available player in the 
draft. He played his prep football at Banning High in Wilmington and was a 
national merit scholarship semifinalist. 
</P>
<P>
He attended a nursery school at the age of 2. And was recognized as a gifted 
child by the state of California. He entered high school at 12. He was 16 when 
he started his first game at Rice where he double-majored in business and 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
But can he play football? 
</P>
<P>
Henning compared him to perennial all-Pro Miami center Dwight Stephenson. 
Henning also said that soon after the Chargers selected Hall, they received a 
call from another team offering their No. 1 pick in 1990 for Hall. Henning 
declined to name the team. Hall is 6-1 1/2 and 275 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Some day this guy (Hall) is gonna be the center on the San Diego Chargers' 
football team," Henning said. How soon that happens depends in large measure on 
how well veteran starter Don Macek's encouraging off-season shoulder 
rehabilitation efforts progress. 
</P>
<P>
For Tolliver to become a starter, he would have to beat out incumbent Mark 
Malone and backups Mark Vlasic and David Archer. Malone had the worst-listed 
quarterback rating in the American Football Conference the last two years. 
Vlasic is recovering from major knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver, 6-0 1/2, 218 pounds, threw 40 interceptions and 38 touchdown passes 
in 3 1/2 years as a starter at Texas Tech. But he impressed Henning who worked 
him out personally at a recent session in Texas. In his senior year, he hit 190 
of 354 passes for 2,869 yards and 20 touchdowns with only 11 interceptions. He 
closed out his career by passing for 456 yards and two touchdowns against 
Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
Henning wouldn't rule out the the possibility of the Chargers participating in 
the supplemental draft in early July at which time there will be a lottery that 
may give them a chance to draft Washington State quarterback Timm Rosenbach or 
Miami quarterback Steve Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
"That remains among our scenarios," Ortmayer said.

MIDDLE RELIEF IS SHAKY AGAIN, PADRES END UP WITH 9-4 DEFEAT 
</P>

<P>
With three Atlanta Braves on the bases in the sixth inning and Padre reliever 
Mark Grant on the mound trying to keep a 5-4 deficit from getting worse, 
pitching coach Pat Dobson ran out for a quick psychology lesson Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Don't try to make it happen.' " Dobson related. "I told him, 'If 
you try to make it happen, you are going to screw up. Just throw your best 
stuff and let it happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
So Grant did, and it happened that Dale Murphy picked off a low fastball and 
grounded it up the middle, under Grant and over second base, scoring two runs 
that helped beat the Padres, 9-4, in front of 17,069 at Atlanta Fulton County 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Another day, another fist slamming into a glove belonging to a Padre middle 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, after the Padres overcame another troublesome start by pitcher Dennis 
Rasmussen to pull to within, 5-4, Grant allowed two runs to make it 7-4. Then 
Dave Leiper came on to take away even the chance of a three-run-tying homer by 
allowing two more runs in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," protested Padre Manager Jack McKeon. "You can always pick a 
game out and say it was the fault of middle relief. Everyone fails to realize 
all the trouble that our starters have put us into sometimes. These relievers 
are coming in with no margin of error. You can't always pinpoint those guys." 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. That was true Sunday in a couple of respects as the Padres fell 
below the .500 mark (9-10) and lost for the fourth time in seven meetings with 
these supposed-to-be-awful Braves. 
</P>
<P>
First, yes, a Padre starter struggled, this time Rasmussen, who couldn't find 
himself or his breaking ball for the third consecutive start. He allowed five 
runs on eight hits in just three innings. In his last 12 innings, he has 
allowed 15 runs on 36 hits, not to mention three losses. 
</P>
<P>
And true, there was little margin for error Sunday when you consider that this 
was the game Murphy finally got tired of the boos. He officially broke out of 
his season-opening slump by going four for five with a career-high-tying six 
RBIs, including two on his third homer. He was hitting .115 with one homer and 
two RBIs on April 18, but has since gone eight for 20 (.400) with two homers 
and 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
But despite both Murphy and Rasmussen, the Padres still could have won after 
they scored three runs in the fifth inning to pull to within 5-4. But because 
of the middle relief, that hurdle became insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
Grant came on in the sixth and promptly threw away a slow roller by Brave 
starter and winner Tom Glavine. Then one out later, he allowed a single to left 
by Jeff Blauser, a walk to Gerald Perry and the single to Murphy. When Leiper 
came on in the eighth, it was even quicker, and worse, as he allowed three 
singles and a double in the span of six hitters. 
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time in seven appearances that Grant has allowed at least 
one run. It was Leiper's second blowup in two games, as he turned a 2-1 deficit 
into a 5-1 loss Saturday by allowing three runs in one inning. In 6 2/3 innings 
this year, Leiper has a 10.80 ERA with eight walks, and actually gained his 
first strikeout Sunday thanks to a swing by Blauser. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst I've pitched in my career," Leiper said. "I haven't pitched 
this bad since Little League." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, throwing out Greg Harris who has pitched just 3 2/3 innings because of 
a now-healed rib injury, the three other middle relievers (Greg Booker is the 
third) have allowed 12 earned runs in 27 innings (4.00 ERA) with 14 walks and 
13 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
And don't think they aren't thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"The middle guys are getting down on themselves," Dobson said. "When you do 
that, it's hard to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Said Booker: "I think everybody keeps counting out our bullpen past Mark Davis, 
and we're all trying to do too much to show we are capable." 
</P>
<P>
Booker was one middle reliever who did the job Sunday with a scoreless inning, 
including the personal victory of retiring Murphy on a pop out with the bases 
loaded in the fourth. Harris also showed that he is healthy with another 
scoreless inning, with two strikeouts. The reason neither stayed in the game is 
as old as the National League itself -- McKeon needed to pinch-hit for them in 
an attempt to score runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres actually scored first when Roberto Alomar, who entered amid a 
two-for-27 slump, became the first Padre hitter to start the game with an 
extra-base hit, by doubling and going to third on an error. He scored on Tony 
Gwynn's single. In all, the Padres had 11 hits, and everyone seemed to begin 
breaking out of slumps except Carmelo Martinez, who went zero for four and is 
now in a one-for-27 slump, and John Kruk, who fouled out in a pinch-hit attempt 
and is four for 33 (.121) for the season. 
</P>
<P>
But the early run Sunday meant nothing when the Braves scored three 
first-inning runs off Rasmussen, who has made a habit of giving those up. In 
his four starts, he has allowed eight first-inning runs on 14 hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried everything to get ready for the game," said Rasmussen, who is 1-3 
with a 7.65 ERA and 34 hits in 20 innings. "Before the San Francisco game, I 
warmed up late. This time I warmed up regular. I'm just not making the big 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "It's too early to say anything about Raz. Probably when the Reds 
traded him to us, they were wondering about his slow start. And look what 
happened (14-4, 2.55 ERA with Padres). 
</P>
<P>
"We don't panic here. We didn't panic last year when we were 14-30, and we 
aren't going to panic after 19 games. . . . It's not time to jump off the 
Brooklyn Bridge."

over the Yokohama Taiyo Whales Sunday. The homer was his second of the season. 
</P>

The Hiroshima Toyo Carp extended their winning streak to six games by beating 
the Chunichi Dragons, 5-2. The Carp tied the game, 1-1, in the sixth inning on

ARREOLA FINDS A DISTANCE SHE LIKES; 
</P>
<P>
CSUN JUNIOR PROMISES TO STAY WITH 1,500 AFTER THIRD AT MT. SAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Darcy Arreola was eliminated in the semifinals of the 1,500 meters 
of last summer's Olympic Trials, friends -- including Cal State Northridge 
track Coach Don Strametz -- have been telling the Northridge runner that the 
3,000 meters is the race best suited to her talents. 
</P>
<P>
She lacks the required finishing speed to be a great 1,500 runner, the theory 
goes. But Arreola, a 20-year-old junior, doesn't give much credence to that 
theory. Especially after finishing third in the invitational 1,500 meters at 
the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in Walnut on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure if it's because everyone keeps telling me that I should run the 
3,000 or what," Arreola said. "But I feel like I can still accomplish a lot 
more in the 1,500. I at least want to run under 4:15 before I give up on that 
event." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola -- who placed fourth in the 3,000 (9 minutes, 18.24 seconds) on 
Saturday night -- appears capable of reaching her goal after running a 
season-best 4:17.35 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally a front-runner, Arreola stayed in the middle of the pack for the 
first 1,000 meters. Fifth at the 400-meter mark in 66.4 seconds and seventh at 
the 800 mark (2:16), Arreola moved into fourth with a lap left. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very strong with a 400 to go," said Arreola, the defending NCAA 
Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000. "Usually I'm dead at that point, 
but today I wasn't tired." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola moved into third with 300 meters left and eased into second 50 meters 
later. She caught leader Leah Pells of Canada with 150 meters left, but was 
outkicked by Pells (4:16.50) and Bridget Smyth (4:16.92) in the final straight. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have kept going past her -- just kept my same rhythm -- but for some 
reason I slowed down when I caught her," Arreola said. "It was like, I did a 
good job to catch up to her, now what?" 
</P>
<P>
Arreola's talent has Strametz pondering a distance triple at this year's 
Division II championships in Hampton, Va., May 24-27. 
</P>
<P>
"The 5,000 is three hours after the 1,500 final and the 3,000 is the day 
before," Strametz explained. "So it is possible." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola -- who has qualified for the national meet in the 800, 1,500, 3,000 and 
5,000 -- is against the idea, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," she said. "The 3,000 seems too long as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Having run a personal best of 4:15.35 to place 10th in The Athletics Congress 
championships two years ago, Arreola's top priority at the moment is the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm ready for a big improvement in that race. I think I'll run much 
faster before the season's done." 
</P>
<P>
Like Arreola, Tyrone Jeffries of Northridge has also qualified for the Division 
II championships in four events, and he'll definitely triple in the national 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're looking at him running in both hurdles and the sprint relay," 
Northridge assistant Tony Veney said. 
</P>
<P>
Having posted Division II qualifying marks in the 110-meter high hurdles and as 
a member of the 400 relay, Jeffries met qualifying standards in the 400-meter 
intermediate hurdles and the 200 meters at Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries finished first in the open 400 hurdles with a season-best of 51.83 
seconds and placed fifth in the open 200 with a wind-aided time of 21.03.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ERROR HELPS NORTHRIDGE TO SOFTBALL SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A throwing error by shortstop Ellen Frank allowed two runs to score, giving Cal 
State Northridge a crucial 3-2, 10-inning win over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and 
a split of a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. doubleheader at CSUN on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded and one out, freshman Heather MacTavish grounded to 
Frank, who threw wildly to the plate in an effort to force Lesley Plank. The 
ball skipped by catcher Kelly McInerney, allowing Lisa Erickson to score the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted to do was put the ball in play and let the defense make the 
mistake. And that's exactly what happened," said MacTavish, who entered the 
game after four innings when starting catcher Char Schmitt became ill. 
</P>
<P>
With the doubleheader split, Northridge (49-15, 13-3 in conference play) needs 
to win just two of its remaining four conference games to clinch its eighth 
consecutive CCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly SLO (24-10-1, 12-5-1) got a well-pitched game from sophomore Laura 
Fawcett and took advantage of some shoddy CSUN fielding to win the opener, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Fawcett (6-5), from Tujunga, gave up a first-inning run on two hits, but 
settled down and gave up just four hits the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN pitcher Heather Lindstrom scattered four hits, but a walk, an error, Lori 
Peterson's double and a sacrifice fly from Missi Cole produced two runs for the 
Lady Mustangs in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly SLO, needing a second-game win to take over the CCAA lead, struck 
early against CSUN starter Debbie Dickmann. Frank was hit by a pitch to start 
the second inning and, after an error by Michelle Blaha, came around to score 
an unearned run on Alison Murray's ground out. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN tied the game an inning later on two singles, an illegal pitch and Anna 
Getherall's run-scoring ground out to second. 
</P>
<P>
In baseball action: 
</P>
<P>
CS Sacramento 4, CS Northridge 1: After stranding 10 runners in a nonconference 
loss at Matador Field, Northridge hits the road today for an important CCAA 
game at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, third in conference at 10-10-1, will pitch Fili Martinez against 
the first-place Mustangs (14-8) today at 4. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento State (30-13), ranked No. 3 in the last Division II baseball poll, 
struck for three runs in the third off CSUN starter Vale Lopez (4-7) Sunday. 
Brian Fichtner's two-run double just inside the third-base line was the big 
blow. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN (23-14-1 overall) scored against Mike Frame (4-1) in the sixth on a 
single, a double, a walk and Randy Thompson's bases-loaded bouncer up the 
middle.

HE-E-E-ERE'S 'OPRAH CON SALSA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christina Saralegui, impeccably dressed and primed for confrontation, steps on 
stage before her Spanish-speaking studio audience, ready to discuss a topic 
that might be difficult for some to handle. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a few years ago, a woman was valued only for the presence or absence of 
her virginity," Saralegui begins. "Virginity was the tool she used to capture a 
man. But according to recent statistics, more than three-quarters of North 
American women have had sex before marriage. What is the reason for such 
radical changes and how have they affected the Hispanic woman?" 
</P>
<P>
Audience members do not shy from the subject. Indeed, they seem eager to join 
in the discourse. 
</P>
<P>
"Nature has given women only two things: femininity and virginity," says an 
elderly man. 
</P>
<P>
Saralegui rolls her eyes and squeals: "Ayyyy!" 
</P>
<P>
The audience laughs. Saralegui -- the Oprah Winfrey of Spanish-language 
television -- is rolling now. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban-born Saralegui, 41, is the newest Spanish-language talk-show host to hit 
the circuit. Her hourlong "Christina" airs daily at 5 p.m. on KMEX-TV Channel 
34. Produced by the Univision network, one of the two largest providers of 
Spanish-language programming, the show made its debut last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Topics include impotence, near-death experiences, Latino gays coming out of the 
closet and the macho Latin male. Sound like Geraldo? Oprah? Phil? Saralegui 
says she wouldn't mind crossing over to mainstream media and joining her 
microphone-wielding brethren. 
</P>
<P>
She would love to do a show in English, she says -- despite her heavy accent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see people complaining about Dr. Ruth or Henry Kissinger or Arnold 
Schwarzenegger," she said during a break while taping two weeks' worth of shows 
at a comfortable theater in East Los Angeles' Plaza de la Raza. 
</P>
<P>
Days before, Saralegui had completed the taping of 15 shows in Miami, where she 
makes her home with her husband, musician Marcos Avila, a former member of the 
Miami Sound Machine, and their three children. She plans to take her show on 
the road to cities with large Latino populations -- such as New York, San 
Antonio and Chicago -- in an effort to boost her ratings. 
</P>
<P>
As the former editor of "Cosmo en Espanol," the Spanish-language version of 
Cosmopolitan, Saralegui is no stranger to controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours was the first magazine that talked about sex to Hispanic America," she 
said. "I've had 17 years practice of talking about delicate stuff." 
</P>
<P>
So the discussion of virginity, which airs today, is right up her alley. 
</P>
<P>
Guests on the program included a Spanish singer-songwriter who has written a 
popular Latin-American song about the subject. In the song, a man tells his 
fiancee that he does not care whether she is a virgin. Not shocking by 
mainstream TV standards, but pretty racy for Spanish-TV. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very, very modern man in his point of view who thinks differently 
from the majority of Latin men," Saralegui announces. "As a woman, I want to 
thank you for being so brave and saying those things." 
</P>
<P>
Other guests included a 27-year-old virgin, a teen counselor and a 
Latin-American plastic surgeon who performs "virginity-restoring" surgery. 
</P>
<P>
During her years in publishing, Saralegui learned that few taboos exist. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something I've discovered: Sex is OK. So is religion, so is politics 
-- anything that is life you can talk about," Saralegui said. 
</P>
<P>
But she has also found that a little levity goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
"I always try to make the show funny, even if the show is very serious. You 
just have to, to make it palatable. I'm trying to cover what is our life -- the 
problems -- but I'm not trying to make it into the tragedy of the week." 
</P>
<P>
But just what is this woman -- who has had no on-camera experience -- doing 
with her own talk show and being hyped as "Oprah con salsa"? (In her previous 
job, she was called "the Latin Helen Gurley Brown.") 
</P>
<P>
Says Saralegui: "I like communicating. I'm a good communicator." 
</P>
<P>
Saralegui is intent on reaching as wide an audience as possible among the 20 
million Spanish-speaking people living in the United States. That means trying 
to do a show that avoids splintering the Latino audience on the basis of what 
Latin-American country they come from. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make a show for everybody," she said. "I want to stress what we have 
in common, instead of stressing regional differences."

F-18 STUNT THAT INJURED PILOT WILL BE DROPPED FROM EL TORO AIR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The familiar sight of a lone Marine Corps F-18 skirting the borders of the El 
Toro air station, making tight turns, low passes and a giant upside-down loop 
in front of hundreds of thousands of gaping spectators, will not be a part of 
this year's Navy Relief Air Show at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines have decided to cut the stunt from this year's show, which is 
scheduled for next Saturday and Sunday, because of the near-fatal crash of a 
lone F-18 during last year's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the bottom line is I'm not willing to take the chance," said Maj. Gen. 
Donald E. P. Miller, commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at El Toro. "We 
damn-near lost one of our group commanders -- and obviously we lost an airplane 
that cost $18 million -- in front of 350,000 people. I'm not sure it's worth 
the risk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miscalculated Altitude 
</P>
<P>
It was a year ago on a hazy, warm, Sunday afternoon during the air show that 
Col. Jerry Cadick brought his F-18 in low across the field at about 400 m.p.h. 
and shot straight up into the air to begin the big loop. 
</P>
<P>
As he went over the top of the loop and started down, the highly decorated 
Vietnam pilot, descending at 10,000 feet per minute, miscalculated his altitude 
and slammed into the runway at the bottom of the loop. 
</P>
<P>
Cadick survived the crash, something even his doctors call a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very moving experience for me out there on that Sunday last year," 
Miller said. "When the accident happened it was so quiet it was almost eerie. I 
saw people with their heads bowed and people who cried after seeing the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"While some might want to think that the American public would like to see 
somebody get bashed like at a boxing match, I don't think there is anyone out 
there who would come hoping something like that would happen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retired From Marines 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Cadick retired from the Marine Corps with a medical 
disability. He is still recovering from multiple broken bones and internal 
injuries he suffered in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Although he talked with reporters last year while recuperating in a Navy 
hospital in San Diego, Cadick declined to talk when contacted at his home last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Cadick, who said he was determined to fly again for the Marines, did not take 
his retirement easily, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just think of the thing you like to do the most and imagine waking up one 
morning and they told you you couldn't do it anymore," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
This year's air show -- which is free to the public -- will be almost like last 
year's, with the exception of the Marine F-18. It will include a Soviet MIG-15 
that will be flown by a former Marine helicopter pilot, and there will be 
skywriting, dogfighting and wing-walking acts. 
</P>
<P>
As in years past, the Air Force will demonstrate its F-16 Fighting Falcon, and 
the Navy will fly its F-14 Tomcat. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the public will be allowed to get a close look at military hardware. The 
displays include the free world's fastest and sleekest helicopters, fighter 
jets and transport aircraft. The biggest exhibit parked along the tarmac will 
be the C-5A, the military's version of the Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
And the Blue Angels, a traditional favorite at the El Toro air show, will 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials hope this year's air show will raise $600,000 or more from 
the sale of food, souvenirs and memorabilia. The money is used to help needy 
sailors and Marines through the Navy's relief program. 
</P>
<P>
The change in this year's lineup at El Toro comes at a time of increasing 
concern over air show safety. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, an air show disaster at a U.S. air base in Ramstein, West Germany, 
killed 70 people when three aircraft of an Italian air force aerobatics team 
collided, one of them then careening into the crowd. Hundreds of people were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force canceled all of its air shows in West Germany for 1989, 
authorities announced in February. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a pilot flying a T-28 military trainer in the Valiant Air Command Air 
Show in Titusville, Fla., was killed when the single-engine plane crashed. 
</P>
<P>
Another pilot of a vintage two-engine plane was killed last October when he 
crashed in a Texas air show sponsored by the Confederate Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The crash last year at the El Toro air show was not the first there. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a World War II-vintage plane flying in the air show plowed into an 
empty chapel on the air station. The pilot and his passenger, both civilians, 
were killed as about 200,000 people watched. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Miller said there has been no pressure locally to discontinue the annual 
air show because of its potential danger. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we the American public accept that aviation is dangerous and we are 
going to have crashes," Miller said.

BICYCLISTS COULD GET THE BOOT FROM CAMP PENDLETON'S FED-UP MARINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a world-class triathlete, Scott Tinley puts in hundreds of miles each week 
on his bicycle along the busy roads of north San Diego County. But when Tinley 
gets tired of dodging cars, he invariably spins onto the rolling coastal bike 
route on the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many other cyclists, Tinley enjoys the panoramic ocean views and dearth 
of auto traffic on the path, which links the coastal communities of north 
county with southern Orange County. An occasional encounter with a tank or a 
Harrier jet only adds to the fun. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the popular bike route may be in peril. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by the obnoxious behavior of some cyclists and worried about potential 
liability problems, Marine officials are eyeing changes to rein in the packs of 
civilian bike riders that flood the base. If the situation gets much worse, 
authorities warn, the base could be shut down entirely to cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be disastrous," said Tinley, a two-time winner of the Ironman 
Triathlon in Hawaii and a staunch advocate of safe cycling. "It would either 
force people to ride on Interstate 5 or, worse yet, not allow them to get from 
Oceanside to San Clemente. To me, it's incomprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
But it could happen. Already the Marine Corps has plans to close the base as of 
May 1 to large fund-raising bicycle tours, which send upward of 500 cyclists at 
one time onto the sprawling military installation. In addition, new rules will 
be instituted, effectively limiting non-sanctioned groups of cyclists to 10 or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Ray Spears, the base community planning and liaison officer, points to 
problems with bicyclists riding four abreast, clogging traffic lanes, running 
stoplights and generally creating a headache as proof that changes are in order 
-- or else. 
</P>
<P>
"If it gets to a point where it's unmanageable, you better believe it, we'd 
close the base to bikes," Spears said. "It's not that big a thing we're asking. 
We just want people to follow the rules and not create a nuisance. The reason 
we're making big noises now is that the problem just keeps growing and 
growing." 
</P>
<P>
The Marines aren't the only ones who realize that bicyclists sometimes wear out 
their welcome on base. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the word needs to get out to all cyclists, please, behave yourself on 
that base," said Ben Hatfield, president of the North County Cycle Club. "It's 
entirely possible the base could be closed to us. I also think it's highly 
possible that if cyclists change their attitude a little bit, it won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Since the bike route was given official sanction in 1976 during the U.S. 
Bicentennial, it has gained a reputation as among the most popular stretches 
for cyclists in Southern California, attracting riders from Orange County, Los 
Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The route stretches south from San Clemente on a 7.5-mile-long bike path leased 
by the California Department of Transportation on the western side of 
Interstate 5. At Las Pulgas Road, the route dips through a narrow tunnel under 
the freeway, and cyclists pick up the trail on base roads the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bicycling Booming 
</P>
<P>
As the sport of bicycling has boomed in recent years, the number of cyclists on 
the route has skyrocketed. A survey by the San Diego Assn. of Governments last 
summer revealed that during a 6-hour period one Sunday, 195 cyclists entered 
the base northbound and 198 southbound. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely important, probably one of the most traveled bikeways in the 
U.S.," said Gordy Shields, bicycle facilities committee chairman for the San 
Diego Assn. of Governments, or Sandag. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from individual cyclists, the bike route is used by numerous clubs for 
organized rides. Some of the Camp Pendleton biking expeditions have become 
weekly institutions, such as the popular Wednesday Ride that sends upward of 
150 cyclists from San Diego County streaming onto the base in one massive pack 
for an invigorating jaunt to San Clemente and back. 
</P>
<P>
Tinley, for one, points to the Wednesday Ride as one of the prime reasons for 
the Marines' get-tough attitude with biking on base. 
</P>
<P>
"The dynamics of a group ride like that are such that it's extremely hard to 
control the pack or ride in single file," explained Tinley, who was one of a 
handful of professional triathletes who instituted the weekly ride several 
years ago. "There's such a blatant disregard for the rules by this group that 
the Marines are having a hard time controlling it." 
</P>
<P>
Base officials won't point fingers at any particular group, but they make no 
bones about their dismay over the attitude of some cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refuse to Abide by Rules 
</P>
<P>
"We've got these jerks out here who refuse to abide by the rules of the road," 
Spears said. "They get aboard the base and if one of them gets creamed, I can 
just see every son of Clarence Darrow bearing down on us with a lawsuit in 
hand. I don't need that kind of grief, and I don't want people killed out here 
because of some idiot doing something unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
Spears said the issue has surfaced now in part because of security concerns, in 
part because a 5-year Caltrans lease on the bike path north of Las Pulgas is up 
for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
When the various sides met in early March, Marine Corps officials came into the 
meeting with a hard-line attitude, bluntly suggesting that they wanted all 
cyclists off base because of the ongoing problems. 
</P>
<P>
"That was their original bargaining point -- to simply close the base to 
bikes," said Hatfield, a participant at the meeting. "Gradually, they got 
around to a softer stance." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Marine officials grew troubled by the prospect that booting the 
cyclists off the base would mean sending them out onto the angry expanses of 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, bikers can ride on a freeway if all other options are closed 
to them. More than 1,000 miles of freeway shoulders are open to bicyclists in 
the state, including an 85-mile segment of Interstate 10 to Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
Base officials and cyclists agree that such a scenario along I-5 across Camp 
Pendleton could be a disaster. With cars racing along the open stretch of 
freeway at speeds often approaching 80 m.p.h., it might only be a matter of 
time before a cyclist is hit and killed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I-5 Treacherous 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt the Marines are afraid that they'd have a bad public relations 
problem on their hands if cyclists were forced out onto that freeway because 
the base closed its roads," Tinley said. "I-5 is so treacherous, someone would 
eventually get smashed." 
</P>
<P>
While hard-core bikers might venture onto the freeway, casual cyclists would 
probably quit using the base, said Dennis Thompson, a Sandag transportation 
planner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very pleasant area," Thompson said. "You get a lot of families cycling 
through there. You'd probably not get them to go on a freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Spears agreed that the Marine Corps does not want to force bikes onto I-5, 
noting that he doesn't "even like being out there in my car." 
</P>
<P>
But base officials want to see changes, and they have extended the Caltrans 
lease on the bike path until September so the state agency can conduct a study 
of ways to improve a situation. 
</P>
<P>
Marine officials would like Caltrans to extend the isolated bike path south 
from Las Pulgas Road so cars and cyclists would not have to dice for space on 
base roads, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan, however, would carry a hefty price tag. It typically costs about 
$70,000 a mile for a paved and fenced bike path, Shields said, and the stretch 
from Las Pulgas Road south to Oceanside is about 7 miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency Lacks Funds 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Demetre, Caltrans regional ride-sharing director, said the agency lacks 
the funds for such a project but is going ahead with its study of the cost of 
the various alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag, however, has a $2-million annual fund for "non-motorized" 
transportation uses, including bicycling. The money, gleaned from the 1-cent 
sales tax measure approved by San Diego County voters in 1987, could be used to 
improve the situation for cyclists on base if the Sandag membership gives its 
approval, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
"A local funding option has to be looked at," he said. "The military can't 
justify money for that type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Short of a full-blown paved pathway, Caltrans may be able to finance lesser 
improvements, such as widening the road shoulders and laying down striping to 
clearly designate a bike lane along Stuart Mesa Road and Vandergrift Boulevard, 
the two thoroughfares bicyclists must navigate along the route. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, plans call for installation of additional signs to keep 
cyclists on the right path. Base security personnel have had to stop cyclists 
venturing into restricted areas. 
</P>
<P>
The base military police could play a pivotal role in easing the problems. Both 
biking advocates and Marine officials are pushing for the Military Police to 
strictly enforce traffic laws for bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urged to Write Tickets 
</P>
<P>
"I've urged them to get the M.P.s to start writing more tickets," Hatfield 
said. "I firmly believe that tough traffic enforcement and a few citations will 
cut down on the problems tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
Shields agreed, saying that all bicyclists should carry identification when 
entering the base or face the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel those (without I.D.) are the ones causing the problem," said Shields, 
a retired college counselor and instructor. "We say ticket 'em if they run 
signals, ride three and four abreast. They know they're not supposed to do 
that. It's clear in the Vehicle Code." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Spears said the Marines will also begin to strictly enforce the new 
prohibition of packs of more than 10 riders. For larger groups, written proof 
of liability insurance coverage, and perhaps even support vehicles will be 
required before they are allowed onto the base, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Smaller groups can come aboard base and we won't bother them," Spears said. 
"Maybe we'll check their identification to make sure they're not the Islamic 
Jihad or something, but that'll be it." 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield said he didn't expect the regulations to affect organized weekend 
bicycle club rides, noting that such groups typically carry insurance. 
Moreover, the club riders generally split up into smaller packs of riders by 
the time they hit Camp Pendleton's main gate in Oceanside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marine officials and bike advocates alike suggest that a marked improvement 
could be made if cyclists simply obeyed the rules of the road and common 
courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
"They have some valid concerns," said Demetre of Caltrans. "They're running 
military equipment. It's a military base. They're mixing bikers and military 
equipment."

PHONE ADVICE SAVES BABY WHO FELL IN POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The 911 emergency call about 1 p.m. Sunday came to Jonathan Wilkes, 31, a fire 
dispatcher in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother's voice was hysterical," Wilkes said. "The first thing she said 
was: 'My daughter is drowning!' " 
</P>
<P>
The victim was a 14-month-old girl who had fallen into a swimming pool at her 
home on North Garland Lane in Anaheim. As Wilkes talked to the mother, 
verifying the address, his partner at the dispatch center, David Paschke, 
notified the paramedic station closest to the child's home. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes tried to calm the mother. Over the phone, he gave her step-by-step 
instructions on how to try to revive the baby with cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR). The effort succeeded. Wilkes, over the telephone, could 
hear the baby, who had not been breathing, begin to cry about 2 minutes after 
Wilkes told the mother what to do. 
</P>
<P>
About 3 minutes later, the Anaheim Fire Department paramedics arrived at the 
house. "I was afraid we'd get there and find a child drowning victim," said 
Anaheim Fire Capt. Alex MacLean of Engine 5. "Instead we found a baby that was 
breathing and crying and screaming. It looked to me like the baby was going to 
be fine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baby's Condition 'Good' 
</P>
<P>
Doctors later agreed. The baby, Tiffany Eichmann, first was taken to Kaiser 
Permanente Anaheim Medical Center and then was transferred to Childrens 
Hospital of Orange County in Orange for observation. A spokeswoman at Childrens 
Hospital said Sunday night that the baby's condition was "good" and that she 
did not require treatment in the intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials on Sunday credited dispatcher Wilkes with being the 
hero in the lifesaving drama. Noting that minutes -- sometimes even seconds -- 
can make the difference between death or brain damage in a near-drowning 
episode, the fire officials said Wilkes' calm, quick action saved Tiffany. 
Department officials said they did not have the names of Tiffany's mother or 
other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Jonathan did a fantastic job," said his supervisor, lead dispatcher Diane 
Boyles. "We've just completed training for our personnel as emergency medical 
dispatchers and that means they can give instructions over the telephone." She 
added that Wilkes' telephone work on Sunday showed the benefit of such 
upgrading for fire dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. MacLean said, "This is a fairly new thing for our dispatchers and I 
think it shows what can be done. Any time a child is saved from a drowning, it 
definitely is a good job." 
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher, Wilkes, downplayed his role during an interview Sunday 
afternoon. But he said he was pleased that his training could be put to good 
use. Wilkes is a dispatcher for Net 4, a communications center in Anaheim that 
handles calls for the fire departments in Anaheim, Orange, Garden Grove, 
Fullerton and Buena Park. The Net 4 dispatchers completed upgrading to 
"emergency medical dispatcher" status last month following several weeks of 
training, Boyles said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calming the Mother 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes said he used his training to try to get quick help to the baby on Sunday 
afternoon, as the paramedics were en route. The first step, he said, was 
calming the mother down. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her the paramedics were on the way, and she became very calm," he said. 
"I then asked her to bring the child inside the house. The baby was brought 
inside, and she told me she put the child on a counter in the kitchen next to 
the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her if the child was breathing and she said 'no.' So I said we would 
go into CPR. I told her to try to establish an airway for the child to breathe. 
After she got the baby positioned, I heard the child make a gurgling sound. I 
told the mother to turn the child's head to allow the water to get out. 
</P>
<P>
"She did this, and then I heard the baby make a coughing sound. Then there was 
the sound of her screaming and crying. I told the mother to let the baby cry -- 
that it was a way of getting oxygen into those lungs." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes said clearing the child's airway and getting the water out proved to be 
all that was needed. He said the mother did not need to use CPR chest pressure 
on the infant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Floating in Pool 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes said the baby girl apparently fell into the house's swimming pool 
shortly before 1 p.m. and was found floating face down. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, who was among the firefighters and paramedics who went to the scene, 
said that an older man, who he guessed to be the child's grandfather, 
apparently jumped into the pool with his clothes on to pull the baby out of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, who is about 25, and other family members declined to talk about 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes praised the mother's response to his telephone instructions. "She was 
very responsive to my instructions, and she followed them exactly," he said. 
"She told me, after it was all over: 'Thank you very much for your help.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes is a graduate of Rancho Santiago College's emergency medical technician 
program. He is a reserve fire inspector for the Anaheim Fire Department, in 
addition to his dispatcher work for Net 4. He also serves as a part-time 
firefighter in Riverside County, where he lives in the city of Riverside with 
his wife and children, ages 12, 9, and 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Having three children of my own, I have a certain amount of empathy dealing 
with a call like this," he said. "After you get off the line, you tend to think 
of your own personal family."

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: YOUNG MARATHON 'JOGGLER' INTENDS TO KEEP RUNNING 
TOWARD THE SPOTLIGHT -- AND GRABBING FOR THE LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Mike Hebebrand was quite a sight running down the street in the recent Los 
Angeles Marathon. He was juggling three balls and a lot of people were 
laughing, but that's exactly what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an entertainer and a performer who wants to make people laugh," said the 
23-year-old Fullerton resident, who worked in a circus as a juggler while 
attending junior and senior high school. 
</P>
<P>
He said most people laughed or clapped as he passed by. "They get a kick out of 
it," he said. "I'm sure they think of me as being different, but not weird." 
</P>
<P>
But there was a serious side to his running the marathon. "I really wanted to 
break the world's record for marathon joggling, but I wasn't in the best of 
shape," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
He ran and finished the Los Angeles Marathon without juggling in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The joggling record is 3 hours and 22 minutes, and Hebebrand missed it by 10 
minutes. Joggling is a combination of juggling and running. If a ball drops, "I 
have to go back to the spot it first dropped and start running again." He 
dropped a ball 10 times during his run. "I knew after 13 miles I wasn't going 
to break the record," said Hebebrand, who teaches physical education in South 
Hills High School in Covina. "I only averaged about 6 miles a day in training, 
and you have to go 10 to have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
He trained by running along the Balboa Bay beachfront, Fullerton horse trails 
and Griffith Park in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time trapeze artist, wire walker and juggler with the defunct Great 
All-American Youth Circus has set his sights on breaking the record next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be in the best shape of my life," said Hebebrand, who is in 
training for the October Iron Man Triathlon in Hawaii. He competed in the event 
in 1984 but failed to finish because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
But he said juggling in the recent marathon gave him more fun than any of his 
other races. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a showoff, but I want to entertain people and make them laugh," he 
said. "It's like when the lights come on and the audience is in their chairs. 
Something starts to click in me." 
</P>
<P>
0 hebebrand has run in many parts of the world, taking spins around the 
Egyptian Pyramids and the Masada fortress in Israel. In another challenge, the 
Biola University graduate hitchhiked across the United States. He was 21 at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pretty big guy (6 feet, 1 inch) so I felt I could take care of myself 
during the trip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also likes to care for others. 
</P>
<P>
Besides coaching disabled children at the First Evangelical Free Church of 
Fullerton, "I stop on the freeway to help people," he said. "God has given us a 
lot in America and we don't tend to share enough, so I share the wealth that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
The rolling hills above the Coast Highway between Laguna Beach and Corona del 
Mar are slowly being ground away by bulldozers, a prelude to development. 
</P>
<P>
But watercolorist Christine Sullivan, a Corona del Mar landscape artist, is out 
there with paintbrushes to record the pristine beauty before the 
heavy-equipment operators take it away. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought of tactics like carrying a sign with a personal message to show my 
anger," she said, "but then I thought, 'Why don't I make a statement by doing a 
series of paintings of the area?' " 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, one of the 160 artists and craftsmen who will exhibit their work at 
the Laguna Beach Festival of Arts starting July 7, said she has been been 
making daily trips to capture the scenes on canvas. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people might call it development," she said. "I call it digression. That 
whole area was a particular favorite of mine that sort of served as my 
psychological safety valve. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- First place Bank of America Achievement Awards of $2,000 
each were presented to Fullerton's Sunny Hills High student Ronald Strauss in 
the science and math category and Santa Ana's Foothill High student Joanna 
Brooks in liberal arts.

JUDGE DOESN'T OBJECT A BIT TO F. LEE BAILEY'S WINNING WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The public flocked to a Newport Beach courthouse last week to watch F. Lee 
Bailey in action, defending Pomona surgeon Thomas A. Gionis against charges 
that he masterminded an attack on his ex-wife, Aissa Wayne, and her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts lawyer drew appreciative laughs and gasps of awe from the 
standing-room-only gallery as he used his legendary courtroom wit to argue that 
his client was not involved in the attack on John Wayne's daughter and 
then-boyfriend Roger W. Luby. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest fan of all, though, seemed to be the person sitting behind the 
bench: Harbor Municipal Judge Susanne S. Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
During last week's preliminary hearing, Shaw continually kidded with Bailey, 
asked for an autograph and at one point even led the courtroom in a round of 
applause for the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Bailey had just passed the Florida state bar examination. Bailey, 
55, had been licensed only to practice law in Massachusetts, although he has 
represented clients in 49 of the 50 states by enlisting local co-counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations for passing the Florida bar exam today," Shaw said to Bailey 
on Thursday as the rest of the courtroom applauded. "We're all real proud of 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the same day, Shaw, 42, a former Orange County deputy district 
attorney, expressed sadness that Gionis' preliminary hearing would soon be 
ending and Bailey would have to go home. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw on Friday ordered Gionis bound over for trial in Orange County Superior 
Court but agreed to set bond for him at $250,000. The orthopedic surgeon had 
been held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
"These will be some of the fondest days of my life," she said at an early point 
in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey returned many of the compliments to the judge. When Shaw commented 
Friday that she had been "awake" during testimony of a previous witness, Bailey 
hastily interjected: "Incredibly alert, if I might make that observation." 
</P>
<P>
Visibly upset over the judge's attention toward Bailey has been Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Christopher J. Evans, toward whom Shaw was far less cordial. On 
Wednesday, for example, Shaw admonished Evans for being "like a 
jack-in-the-box" for jumping up and raising objections to Bailey's examination 
of a witness. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you take a deep breath for me?" the judge asked a red-faced Evans. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Shaw interrupted Evans' closing arguments on a bail hearing for 
Gionis, and said: "Don't shove it down my throat, Mr. Evans. I get the picture. 
Get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
The comment had been preceded by Evans' suggestion that "we're on notice" if 
bond is set for Gionis and he commits a crime. 
</P>
<P>
The sensational aspect of the case also kept the judge keenly focused on the 
attendant media coverage. Several times, she inquired whether a particular 
television or newspaper reporter was present and told Bailey in court that she 
had just gotten a call from the television program "Entertainment Tonight," 
which she said was interested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
But Shaw was less benevolent toward the Orange County Register, which ran a 
picture of her that caused her later in the week to confront a Register 
photographer with the complaint that the photo had made her look like "a side 
of beef." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, during a bail hearing that followed the preliminary hearing, Shaw 
joked in open court that the photograph should have carried the caption: 
"USDA."

Photo, Having a Tall Time -- In festivities befitting a three-way celebration, 
three tall ships took part in a fund-raiser at Dana Point Harbor on Sunday. At 
left, the Kelpie of Dana Point, left, and the Spike Africa of Newport Beach 
"raft up" to the State Tall Ship Californian, which is about to leave on a 
4-month, 10,000-mile journey. Besides being a bon voyage party, the festivities 
marked the Californian's 5th birthday and the retirement of mascot Windy the 
cat. Providing entertainment was the band Raggle Taggle from San Diego, lower 
left. About 160 guests were on board for the celebration, traveling from ship 
to ship. Among the sights was the Californian's message-inscribed helm, above.

POSTSCRIPT: THE DISAPPEARING AUDITOR'S GAMBLE HAS PAID OFF, SO FAR

<P>
Few clues have turned up in the Case of the Disappearing Night Auditor, 
according to Buena Park police. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found his car, and we think he's flown out of the state," Sgt. Lloyd 
Schwengel said. "But we don't know where he is." 
</P>
<P>
The object of the search is Joseph Patrick Cairns, 57, a Placentia husband and 
father of four grown children. Cairns, who had no prior criminal record, was 
the night auditor at Medieval Times, the Buena Park restaurant with a chivalric 
theme. He was last seen there early in the morning on Feb. 6, tallying weekend 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Police initially said Cairns had absconded with $100,000 in cash from the 
restaurant. But recent court records say the amount was $150,000, and police 
now confirm that at least that much was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Cairns' yen to gamble was the apparent motive, according to Detective David 
Woofter: "He took off to gamble at least once before." 
</P>
<P>
County court records show that Cairns disappeared suddenly and with no 
explanation to his wife, Dolores, and children twice before, in November, 1981, 
and December, 1984. Cairns returned both times, and no criminal charges 
resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Woofter said that in one of those instances, Cairns stole money from his 
then-employer in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Woofter said Cairns made arrangements to repay the money, so no charges 
resulted. 
</P>
<P>
In the prior disappearances, Dolores Cairns filed court papers for legal 
separation from her husband. This time, she filed on March 20 in Orange County 
Superior Court for legal dissolution of the couple's 37-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
In other recent court papers, Dolores Cairns asked for, and obtained, a court 
order prohibiting her husband from disposing of any common property, including 
the couple's home on Shaver Way in Placentia. The March 22 court documents 
refer to Cairns' "penchant for gambling." 
</P>
<P>
When recently contacted by telephone, Dolores Cairns said she has no comment 
about her husband's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Woofter said police have no indications that Cairns had gambling debts when he 
disappeared, but the detective noted that Cairns had a virtual obsession for 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
"I've notified the cities that allow gambling, including Atlantic City and the 
bigger cities in Nevada," he said. "We have arrest warrants for grand theft and 
for unlawful flight." 
</P>
<P>
The latter is a federal warrant that allows the FBI and other federal agencies 
to look for and try to apprehend Cairns. 
</P>
<P>
The only major clue that has turned up was the discovery recently of the car he 
was last using. Woofter said the car, a 1971 Volkswagen, was found March 29 in 
the parking lot of the Holiday Inn at 2640 Lakewood Blvd., Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"All the indications are that the car was left there on Feb. 6, the same day he 
disappeared from Buena Park," Woofter said. "It doesn't appear that the car was 
ever used since then." 
</P>
<P>
The motel and its parking lot are near Long Beach Airport. "It's within walking 
distance of the airport, and my belief is that's where he went," Woofter said. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, police have found no clues as to where Cairns may have flown. Sgt. 
Schwengel said it is unlikely that Cairns flew out under his own name. 
</P>
<P>
Woofter said a gambling haunt seemed initially to be the best place to look for 
Cairns, so "I spent some time in Las Vegas looking for him." 
</P>
<P>
His search turned up nothing. "My guess right now is that he's gone back to New 
Jersey, because that's where he's originally from," Woofter said. "People tend 
to go back to some place they know, some place they've felt comfortable. So I 
think he might be in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"But nobody really, really knows."

NICHOLS SHOWS HE CAN MAKE HIS MARK IN 800-METER RUN; 
</P>
<P>
EDISON RUNNER MOVES TO A NEW EVENT, AND HE LIVES UP TO OWN EXPECTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little less than a year ago, Doug Nichols of Edison High School stood beside 
the track at the Southern Section track and field preliminaries and watched as 
the entrants in the boys' 800-meter run sped past. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, then an above-average 400-meter runner, was not extremely impressed. 
In fact, although he had never raced the 800, he felt certain he could run it 
as fast, or faster, than those in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember thinking, 'That can't be that tough,' " said Nichols, who ran 
cross-country in the fall. "I was pretty sure I could run a 1:56." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Nichols, then a junior, was saying he could run the distance in 1 
minute 56 seconds -- a time achieved by only about 100 high school runners in 
the nation last year. 
</P>
<P>
Was Nichols a bit overconfident? A little cocky? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in his first 800-meter race, Nichols outkicked Corona del Mar 
standout Eddie Lavelle to win the Beach Cities Invitational 800 in 1:55.9. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago at the Arcadia Invitational, he placed fourth in a national-class 
prep field in 1:53.93. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday, at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays, Nichols improved his time 
once again, running a 1:52.54 to place a very close third behind two foreigners 
-- Mike McLean of Edmonton, Canada (1:52.34) and Mexico's Arturo Espejel (also 
1:52.54). 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' mark is the best in California this season and the third-best mark in 
the nation. Florida's Scott Peters, who won the Arcadia Invitational 800 in 
1:52.51, has the country's top time. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Nichols is considered the early-season favorite to win the State 800 
title in June. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable? Quite so, considering that a year ago, he failed to advance past 
the Southern Section preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it is kind of surprising, actually," Nichols said. "I mean for me to 
be (so close) off the national best . . . " 
</P>
<P>
An explanation for Nichols' sudden success? Nichols points to the mixture of 
his cross-country background with his 49-second speed in the open 400. 
</P>
<P>
But Edison distance coach Stan Stauble, who claims he was not at all surprised 
with Nichols' first 800 performance, said he is keeping Nichols' training a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone calls me to find out what Doug's doing," Stauble said. "Everyone 
wants to know my system. But I keep quiet." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that no matter how he trains, Nichols -- who said he runs only 15 
miles a week in training, about 15-20 miles less than the average 
middle-distance runner -- is bound to improve. Especially when he becomes more 
adept in race tactics. 
</P>
<P>
To the casual observer, there might not seem much difference between the 400- 
and 800-meter races aside from the distance. But the fact is that the 400, a 
one-lap race in which all runners remain in separate lanes, is somewhat docile 
compared to the 800, in which all entrants are allowed to cut to the inside 
lane after the first 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
It is at this cut-in point, as well as the remainder of the race, where some of 
track's biggest battles are fought. Runners speed up, slow down, jostle and 
bump -- many times intentionally -- in order to gain better position. It is not 
at all uncommon for elbows to be thrown, heels to be clipped and shins to be 
"spiked" by opponents' shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Like most newcomers to the event, Nichols, a 6-foot-2, 155-pound senior, has 
not had the easiest time adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
At the Arcadia meet, Nichols, trying unsuccessfully to keep from getting boxed 
in, tripped and almost fell. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting boxed in is new to me," 
</P>
<P>
said Nichols, who takes all honors classes and carries a 4.2 grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"My first race was rough; everyone was really pushing. It's like you have to 
speed up or slow down at any time, but then make sure you don't get boxed. At 
the same time, you've got to stay relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at Mt. SAC, Nichols fell into a similar trap, getting boxed in early 
in the race and having to move outside to lane 3 where he ran for nearly 500 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
"I never once got into lane 1," Nichols said. "I think I ran an 810 meters. 
With about 100 yards to go, I passed about four guys. If I had started kicking 
earlier, I might have won." 
</P>
<P>
How fast does Nichols think he can run the 800 this year? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably about 1:50, I hope," he said. "Especially after (the Mt. SAC race) 
because I felt real good after I finished. I had a lot left. I wish I had 
kicked sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if I got in a big race like (Mt. SAC), and if I kind of led it where I 
wouldn't have to catch up, I think I could do a 1:50 or so." 
</P>
<P>
With Nichols, only time -- or tactics -- will tell.

SIEGLER: DON'T SAY HANDICAPPED; 
</P>
<P>
HE JUST WANTS TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DON PATTERSON

<TEXT>
<P>
There were 46,846 curious people at Anaheim Stadium for the Angels' fifth game 
of the season. Their curiosity was understandable because pitcher Jim Abbott 
was about to make his major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
One fan was not particularly curious, though maybe that was not quite so 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Dan Siegler. He just wanted to watch a ballgame, so much so that 
he turned down three dates to a Sadie Hawkins dance. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, as nearly everybody knows by now, has one hand. Siegler, a senior first 
baseman on the Fallbrook High School baseball team, also was born with one 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the first pitch in Anaheim Stadium, Siegler watched 
photographers cluster around Abbott as he emerged from the dugout. And Siegler 
wondered aloud why people are always so curious. About Abbott. About him. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's hard to understand," he said, watching Abbott warm up. "To me, 
it's like, 'What the hell. It's the way I am.' " 
</P>
<P>
Until this season, Siegler was just another high school kid playing ball. He 
played at California Lutheran in Garden Grove for three years before he 
transferred to Fallbrook last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Siegler has received considerable recognition, but he finds the attention 
somewhat ironic. He has teammates going to Arizona State to play baseball. 
Nobody has been in touch with them about doing a story. Yet Siegler, who does 
not play a lot and whose competitive baseball career probably will end after 
this season, is creating something of a stir. 
</P>
<P>
So as Abbott pitched, Siegler said several times to the reporter sitting next 
to him: "I think this is the last interview like this I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Siegler doesn't consider himself a good story. Or even a story at all. He's 
just a guy who plays on a team. An average high school student who gets lazy 
now and then, Siegler isn't afraid to put a cocky freshman in his place. He 
likes teachers who encourage students to form their own opinions, he tells an 
occasional joke and he turns up the radio when a Guns and Roses song comes on. 
</P>
<P>
The word handicap isn't mentioned when Siegler is talking. He just lives and 
plays ball using the tools he was given. He has never spent time worrying about 
what he can and can't do or what he might be able to do if things were 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever picked on me," he said. "Probably because they don't notice. 
Your friends aren't going to rag on you. They don't say, 'This is my friend. 
He's got only two fingers.' " 
</P>
<P>
Siegler plays about the same way the left-handed Abbott does, in his case 
catching with his right hand and shifting his glove over when he throws. 
Because he has one finger and a thumb on his left hand, he uses it for support 
when he bats. And that's that. It's as natural for him as falling asleep. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been asked the question if it's tough or not," he said. "I'd have to say, 
'No.' It's normal for me. I guess that's why I don't understand why people ask 
the questions they ask. I must be doing something different, but it's not 
different for me." 
</P>
<P>
Siegler, 18, would just as soon not get any extra attention. If he were as good 
as Abbott, he would have to learn to cope with the constant clicking of 
cameras, the endless interviews and the same questions over and over. When 
Abbott trotted to the mound and photographers scrambled anywhere they could to 
get a picture, Siegler slid to the edge of his seat and said: "That would bug 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott is not Siegler's hero. Never was. Siegler hasn't followed Abbott's 
career closely or tried to emulate his style of play. Siegler hadn't even heard 
of Abbott until his father, Paul Siegler, told him there was a one-handed 
pitcher on the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look up to Abbott," said Siegler matter of factly. "He's just another 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get the wrong impression. Siegler gives credit to Abbott for the Angel 
pitcher's success. But not for the same reason most people do. Siegler is 
impressed because Abbott is a major league player, the same way he is impressed 
with Don Mattingly or any other professional player. That Abbott has one hand 
is seemingly of little consequence. 
</P>
<P>
And his observations at the ballpark support that. He doesn't focus on Abbott. 
A foul ball gets ripped into the stands. Siegler smiles and shakes his head. 
"People are so crazy trying to catch that ball with their bare hands. Do they 
know how fast that thing is going?" 
</P>
<P>
A player's batting average is flashed on the screen. "This guy's batting 1.000. 
Probably one for one," Siegler said, drawing a laugh from someone sitting 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
It's fairly obvious, though, that Siegler is pulling for Abbott, just like 
everybody else. He'll point out that Abbott's fastball has been clocked at 94 
m.p.h., 
</P>
<P>
which, he says, is "good enough for the show here." When Abbott departed in the 
fifth inning of a rather inauspicious debut, Siegler said: "I think he did 
pretty well for a first major league start. He did what a pitcher is supposed 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
The fans gave Abbott a standing ovation as he walked off the field. No one 
clapped louder than Siegler. 
</P>
<P>
After Abbott had disappeared into the dugout, Siegler said: "(The fans) are 
wondering about how Abbott does. They have a right to be curious. Let them get 
their curiosity out of the way and look at him as a regular ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way Siegler wants it. Treat him the same as everybody else. His 
coach, Dave Heid, does. Siegler says he gets yelled at just like the rest of 
the players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Siegler's spot on the roster isn't charity. He's hitting .333 in 15 
at-bats, including a bases-loaded triple against El Camino. Heid says there's 
no one with a dirtier uniform after practice. "He has definitely earned his way 
on the team by being one of the 16 best players at Fallbrook High," Heid said. 
</P>
<P>
Siegler accepts his role. Winning, he says, can be just as satisfying from the 
bench. A win is a win. But there are trying times,, such as the times where it 
takes him a little too long to get the ball out of his glove and into his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"When he messes up, he gets really frustrated," said teammate John Clift, who 
once served up a home run ball to Siegler in Pony League. "He takes it pretty 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
He always has. For that reason, his father used to encourage him to play 
soccer. He knew Dan would always drive himself to succeed and figured he 
wouldn't be at a disadvantage on the soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to keep him away from (baseball)," Paul Siegler said. "We didn't want 
to see him fail." 
</P>
<P>
But baseball was Siegler's favorite. So he gave up soccer, stuck with baseball 
and made a go of it. Deep down, Paul says, Dan has something he wants to prove. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do anything anybody else can do and I'll do it just as well . . . or at 
least I'll try," said Dan, adding quickly, "I'm not trying to sound stuck on 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
He rarely does. Siegler doesn't appear overly impressed with himself. He talks 
of being an average student and speaks highly of his younger brother Philip, 
who is a good baseball player and a good student. Siegler is outgoing and 
friendly and enjoys meeting people. 
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't really consider himself an inspiration for others with 
handicaps. That's not because he doesn't care. He once spent a week showing a 
kid who also had only one hand how to catch and throw a baseball. But when he 
plays, he just plays. Nothing more, nothing less. 
</P>

TRACKING TECHNOLOGY'S TOTS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICAL FIELDS ARE RAISING SOME PROMISING YOUNGSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Olmos, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gregory Ross keeps a close watch on Orange County's growing high-technology 
industry from his spacious ninth-floor office in a Costa Mesa building. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross is a senior partner at the Orange County office of Arthur Young &amp; 
Co., a national accounting firm. He is also director of Arthur Young's local 
high-tech group, which provides financial and consulting services to technology 
companies. Arthur Young is one of several major accounting firms in the county 
with specialized high-tech services. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross has worked in Arthur Young's Orange County office since 1977, when he was 
transferred from Boston to handle the firm's account with Fluor Corp. of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 8 years, Ross' office has been compiling statistics on Orange 
County's technology industry. He has tracked the progress of growing technology 
firms and paid particular attention to how they got their start and where they 
got their financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross' research shows that biomedical and biotechnology companies are 
attracting most of the venture capital financing coming into the county today. 
That's a big change from 6 or 7 years ago, when computer and electronics firms 
attracted the most attention from outside investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times staff writer David Olmos, Ross discussed the 
county's changing technology industry and where it appears to be headed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it difficult for Orange County technology companies to attract venture 
capital at this time? 
</P>
<P>
A. It really has been difficult throughout the 1980s for Orange County 
companies to attract venture capital. If we look at the number of companies 
that have received financing in the county -- and there are about 130 of them 
-- they have varied from electronic and consumer-based companies getting most 
of the funding in the early '80s, to health care and medical device companies 
getting their financing in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you explain that shift in where the venture capital money is going? 
</P>
<P>
A. As the computer industry has become more competitive here in Orange County 
and throughout the world, there have been fewer opportunities for venture 
capital companies to receive the kind of financial returns they demand on their 
portfolio companies. They're seeking to branch out into the medical technology 
area, where the potential gains are much higher. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do the financial performances of computer and medical technology 
companies compare? 
</P>
<P>
A. The gross (profit) margins in the medical device field range from 50% to 
60%. Whereas, if you look at a typical manufacturer of IBM-compatible personal 
computers, the gross margins are about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the track record of county companies that have received venture 
capital funding? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you look at Orange County companies that have attracted venture capital 
in the past 5 years, only six of them have gone public. I think that's 
significant. There have been more than 15 acquisitions of Orange County 
companies that had venture capital backing and only six public (stock) 
offerings in the past 4 to 5 years. Of those 130 venture-backed companies, at 
least seven, and possibly as many as 15, have gone bankrupt. That's a very poor 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much venture capital money has been invested in county technology 
companies? And what type of companies are getting it? 
</P>
<P>
A. The 130 companies have received about $649 million since 1982. There's been 
a significant change in where those venture capital dollars are going. In the 
1983-1984 period, 53% of the county companies receiving venture financing were 
computer firms, whereas 25% where in the medical technology and health care 
field. That contrasts with 1987-88, when 70% of the companies receiving 
financing were medical-related companies and 14% were computer firms. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the track record been so far for these medical technology companies? 
</P>
<P>
A. They have not grown up to be significant Orange County employers, but 
instead have been acquired by many of the large county-based medical technology 
companies, with the attendant loss of jobs and loss of additional opportunities 
for growth in the county. In San Diego, they had a home-run company with 
Hybritech, which was acquired for $400 million by Eli Lilly and Co. We haven't 
had a similar very large acquisition like that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do any Orange County computer companies qualify as home-run companies? 
</P>
<P>
A. AST Research is a home-run company, but we have not had many in the county. 
If you compare our track record with Silicon Valley's, we aren't close. They 
have had many more companies grow to $1 billion (in annual sales). It's 
difficult to say why. If we look at the types of companies being started in the 
county, they aren't significantly different from what you would see in Silicon 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there any smaller companies you see now as having the potential to be 
major successes? 
</P>
<P>
A. The only significant public offering we've had in the county since the 1987 
stock market crash has been a company called Medstone International, which 
manufactures medical devices for removing gallstones and kidney stones. 
Medstone (headquartered in Irvine) went public last June and has grown 
substantially. Its profits have increased significantly, and it is on very 
rapid growth rate. Another significant county company that received venture 
capital funding was FileNet, which raised over $35 million in venture funds. 
FileNet has grown since going public, but it is not yet rivaling Western 
Digital or other significant county companies. FileNet hasn't showed the type 
of potential that the venture capital backers had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the the venture capital that goes to Orange County firms come from 
within or from outside the county? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are now more than 30 venture firms represented in the county. Most of 
the money in the 130 deals has come from outside the county. Although the 
companies are here and doing business here, they still have to go outside the 
county for participation in their deals. Additionally, there are many more 
venture financing companies throughout the world than there are resident in 
Orange County. And a lot of those U.S. and international firms want to make 
investments in California. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It's quite difficult for a high-technology company to complete a public 
stock offering now, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Since the October, 1987, stock market crash, there have been very few 
venture-backed companies that have gone public, in Orange County and 
nationwide. Nationally, 98 venture-backed technology companies went public in 
1986; 81 companies in 1987; but only 35 in 1988. So the decrease has occurred 
nationwide. What has happened is the underwriters have been unwilling to take a 
company public and have found resistance in the marketplace. We would expect 
this to reverse some time in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What effect would a recession have on all that? 
</P>
<P>
A. It would delay the rise out of the trough that we are currently in. What's 
needed is stronger (demand) from the investment community for new public 
issues. The market now is unwilling to take on high-risk, high-tech companies. 
If you look at the returns on Orange County-based high-tech companies to their 
investors since the stock market crash, you find the Dow has risen about 18% 
since the first quarter of 1988, whereas county technology companies are up 
about 28%. So, there's a 10% higher return from county technology companies 
compared to the Dow. That would lead one to believe that the underwriting 
community will eventually recognize Orange County technology companies as 
having some potential, and will be willing to take more of them public. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there a lot of Orange County high-tech firms ready to go public when the 
time is right? 
</P>
<P>
A. In 1988, there were more than 37 companies in Orange County that obtained 
venture financing. Most of those are still quite small. The appetite of the 
public marketplace has varied over time. There was a time when new companies 
with barely a product on the street and little sales history were considered a 
good investment because of the future potential, to times when only more mature 
companies with a history of sales and profits were in favor. No one really 
knows where we will come out of this depression in the public marketplace. If 
it comes out on the side of younger, smaller companies, then there are a number 
of Orange County companies that are ready. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How many small county companies would you expect to go public? 
</P>
<P>
A. Probably dozens of them. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where are those entrepreneurs coming from? 
</P>
<P>
A. They are coming from the aerospace companies and from the ASTs and Western 
Digitals of the community. They are also coming from the health care and 
medical device companies such as Allergan and American Hospital Supply. These 
large companies are spawning people who come out on their own with product 
ideas. Oftentimes, these products simply were not viable for the companies they 
worked for, so they left to pursue their ideas on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is it important for Orange County to have spinoff companies and for 
employees of large firms to quit and form their own ventures? 
</P>
<P>
A. If we look at employment trends in the county and nationwide, the majority 
of new jobs are created by small companies, not large ones. In the county, we 
see a large number of small companies in the Irvine Spectrum area and the 
industrial parks. They are the growth potential for the county. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How does Orange County compare to Silicon Valley or other high-tech areas as 
far as nurturing these entrepreneurial companies? 
</P>
<P>
A. The county has a number of the types of support organizations you would see 
in Silicon Valley, such as the American Electronics Assn. and UC Irvine, which 
has initiated a corporate-university partners program to bring Orange County 
companies on campus to explore joint research projects. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the advantages that Orange County has that favor growth of 
its technology industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the county has recognized the need for specialized services and has 
grown those kind of services, such as public relations firms, lawyers, 
accountants and others to help nurture start-up companies. Lately, we've seen 
more Silicon Valley-based professional service organizations move into the 
county to bring the expertise gained in other marketplaces to here. A number of 
Bay Area law firms have created offices in the county during the past 18 
months, as well as public relations firms specializing in high tech. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is Orange County as far along in that regard as some other areas? For 
example, San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
A. San Diego has been working at it longer and harder. Scripps Institute and UC 
San Diego have been quite active in the biotechnology field. We are ahead in 
the electronics area. They have a significant success story in Hybritech. They 
have an infrastructure of individuals associated with Hybritech, who have done 
it before and now are out helping individuals to try to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do you consider Orange County's biggest success story? 
</P>
<P>
A. AST Research, I think, is probably our most recent significant success 
story. Although lately we've seen some press stories that would lead one to 
believe they're not as profitable as one would hope. But they have clearly 
grown over the years from a very small company started by three founders to a 
significant player in the world of IBM-compatible personal computers. AST is 
really the only significant, venture-backed company that has been a major home 
run in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You've been watching the Orange County technology industry for the past 8 
years. What are some of the changes you have noticed? 
</P>
<P>
A. We're starting to see more home-grown talent than we used to have. 
Historically, there hasn't been a strong infrastructure to support the 
entrepreneur-engineer who's looking to come out of an aerospace, computer or 
medical technology company and start his own company. There have been strides 
in this area the past 5 years to give more support to those people. There has 
also been more of a history in the county of entrepreneurs who have started 
companies, grown them to a size where they were merged or acquired, and then 
gone out and started another company. That change has helped the growth of the 
county because those entrepreneurs now understand the complexities and pitfalls 
of the marketplace and can bring more experience into their second or third 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How is the county's high-tech industry going to change during the next 10 or 
15 years? 
</P>
<P>
A. With the high cost of housing in the county and the difficulty of obtaining 
affordable labor, it is increasingly going to become an area for research and 
development operations and corporate headquarters. Intensive manufacturing 
won't be done in Orange County. It will move to other states or offshore. But 
we will continue to attract the brain-trust people, the corporate executives, 
engineers and scientists.

<P>
A third day of deliberations in Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra trial was 
disrupted today when medical help was called in to assist three members of the 
jury who fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
A note to Judge Gerhard A. Gesell asked that a nurse be summoned to the jury 
room, where one juror was suffering from high blood pressure apparently as a 
result of rich food served at the hotel where the panel is sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
At a noon hearing, Gesell said, "There is potentially a health problem with 
these jurors. A cold is running through the jury and two of them have chest 
colds." 
</P>
<P>
"None of these people are complaining that they can't go ahead with their 
service," Gesell told the lawyers. " . . . If it approaches any kind of crisis 
stage -- and it has not -- I'll call you in." 
</P>
<P>
There was no discussion in court of what course would be followed if any of the 
jurors were forced to drop out. Court rules state that if it becomes necessary 
to excuse a juror during deliberations, "in the discretion of the court a valid 
verdict may be returned by the remaining 11 jurors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Note From Foreman 
</P>
<P>
Gesell came into the courtroom today, for the first time since the jury 
received the case, after receiving a note from the foreman that said: "Could 
you please send for nurse for Jean Johnson. Recheck blood pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Johnson, 53, registered a blood pressure of 160-over-98 when she was 
checked by the courthouse nurse, Gesell said. He got the lawyers' permission to 
summon her own doctor and have her examined in the presence of a U.S. marshal. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the juror had a blood pressure problem and the blood pressure 
elevated, perhaps in part because her diet (while the jury is sequestered) is 
richer than she is accustomed to," Gesell said. 
</P>
<P>
North, the former Ronald Reagan Administration aide, was not in court today. He 
has been on trial since Jan. 31 on 12 criminal charges that include lying to 
Congress, obstructing congressional and presidential inquiries, and making 
personal use of funds involved in the secret effort to help the Nicaraguan 
Contra rebels at a time when official U.S. aid was banned. 
</P>
<P>
He could be sentenced to as much as 60 years in prison and fined up to $3 
million if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said today he has not discussed with anyone a possible pardon 
for North if he should be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Speculation 'Stupid' 
</P>
<P>
Bush, commenting aboard Air Force One on his way to a speech in Chicago, said 
speculation about what he'll do is "stupid" and "idiotic" -- and uninformed 
since "I haven't discussed it nor shared my thoughts with anybody. I don't have 
any thoughts until I get the facts." 
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a question about a report in Newsweek magazine quoting 
sources close to him as predicting he would never pardon North. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing today, Gesell also told the lawyers that NBC News left unsigned 
letters at the homes of the North case jurors, inviting them to be interviewed 
after the trial is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was most inappropriate, improper conduct, quite disrespectful of 
the situation we are dealing with," he said. But, he said, it is too late to do 
anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC letters were slipped under doors at the jurors' homes. One was 
discovered by a U.S. marshal who went to one of the homes to pick up a jury 
member's mail.

A man who broke down and cried before television cameras when told of his 
girlfriend's slaying was arrested in her death after investigators found traces 
of blood in the couple's apartment, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Robert Spontak, 22, booked on suspicion of murder, was arrested early 
Sunday in the death of Denise Marie Duerr, 21. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the only girlfriend I've ever had. I loved her," Spontak cried when 
told Thursday that Duerr's body had been found in a remote ditch off Green 
River Road. 
</P>
<P>
But after traces of blood were discovered during a weekend search of the Garden 
Grove apartment the couple shared, Spontak was arrested, Riverside Sheriff's 
Lt. Nick Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got so many calls from people who had seen this guy (Spontak) on the news. 
They all said he wasn't for real and that he was involved in the killing 
somehow," Padilla said. "But until we got a search warrant and went in with 
investigators and district attorney's office people, we didn't have the 
evidence. We do now." 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy showed that Duerr, an aspiring actress who worked for Data Circuit 
in Orange, had been stabbed to death, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of the couple's, Cameron Seaholm, 22, was arrested on suspicion of 
murder two days after the body was found. Duerr's car was found parked outside 
Seaholm's Lake Elsinore home.

Israelis rampaged through the Arab city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank 
today, smashing shop and car windows after Palestinians stoned their buses on 
the way to a Jewish shrine, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospitals said Israeli troops shot and wounded 
at least 18 Palestinians on the third successive day of heavy casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Arab and Jewish witnesses said Israelis broke 30 shop windows and 20 car 
windshields in Hebron after their three tour buses came under attack on the way 
to the nearby Cave of Machpela. Jews believe that the biblical patriarchs 
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are buried there.

The rampage through Hebron, the West Bank's second-largest city and a

KARAJAN RESIGNS AT BERLIN PHILHARMONIC

<P>
Herbert von Karajan, an internationally acclaimed conductor who sold 150 
million albums worldwide, resigned today after 34 years as director of the 
Berlin Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan, whose chronic back problems have made it difficult for him to walk to 
a podium, cited frail health as his reason for resigning, said Anke Martiny, 
West Berlin's culture senator. 
</P>
<P>
She said she received a letter today from Karajan informing her that he is 
stepping down immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan was appointed "conductor for life" of the Berlin orchestra in 1955, and 
his resignation leaves open one of the most coveted conductor's posts. Many 
leading conductors have been mentioned as possible successors since Karajan's 
health began to deteriorate, but his resignation letter made no recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan, 81, was born in Salzburg and keeps a residence in the Austrian resort. 
A child prodigy who made his piano debut at age 5, he now earns an estimated 
$6.2 million annually from his recordings. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Nazi Party while a rising young musical star during Hitler's 
reign, and his involvement was still drawing criticism more than 40 years after 
the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his Nazi links, the Allies banned Karajan from performing for two 
years after the war and required him to undergo a "denazification" program. In 
an interview, Karajan once said he had joined the Nazis so his career would not 
be jeopardized but insisted that he had no sympathies for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Martiny, whose department in the West Berlin legislature is in charge of the 
orchestra, said: "I respect this decision by Herbert von Karajan, which comes 
for health reasons. Berlin thanks Herbert von Karajan for his longtime, 
excellent and successful work." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Karajan's friends in Berlin will have one more opportunity to see 
him conducting the Berlin Philharmonic" in a farewell performance, she added. 
</P>
<P>
His last performance in the United States was on Feb. 28, 1988, at Carnegie 
Hall with the Vienna Philharmonic.

Adragon De Mello made headlines last year by graduating from college at age 11, 
but now his university is examining his high-pressure academic career, which 
featured double course loads and frequent waivers and grade changes. 
</P>
<P>
Adragon, who received a degree in computational mathematics from the University 
of California at Santa Cruz, did well in some classes but in others struggled 
to pass or failed to complete course work by the end of the term, according to 
a published report. 
</P>
<P>
UC's advising system seems to have "let him down," said Vice Chancellor Isebill 
V. Gruhn. Adragon's counselors should have been alarmed by the pressures on the 
boy and his often mediocre work, Gruhn told the Santa Cruz Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Robert B. Stevens said his office will investigate the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Adragon gained widespread attention and became an entry in the Guinness Book of 
World Records as the youngest college graduate. 
</P>
<P>
According to university records, Adragon took a double load of classes and 
often used petitions and waivers to win exceptions from UC's usual 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
But Adragon's father, Agustin De Mello, defended his son, claiming that any 
negative evaluations were written by people who were prejudiced against the 
boy. De Mello had drawn up plans for raising a genius -- including advanced 
degrees and a Nobel Prize by age 16 -- even before Adragon was conceived.

Calls for a class boycott to press demands for greater democracy won widespread 
support at Beijing campuses today, but there was little evidence of student 
strikes spreading to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The exact number of participants in the boycott was not known, but students at 
a dozen schools with total enrollment of more than 50,000 said virtually all 
their classmates were striking. Authorities took no open steps to interfere, 
but sources said more than 10,000 soldiers from outlying counties moved into 
Beijing over the weekend in preparation for an eventual crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of new student activities in other cities today. Foreign 
sources reported new looting Sunday night in the central city of Changsha in 
Hunan province, where young toughs mixed in with a student protest Saturday and 
went on a rampage.

The "Flintstones" cartoon characters filled in for one morning television news 
program today and silence greeted many radio listeners as thousands of British 
Broadcasting Corp. workers went on strike for higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour walkout by 18,000 of the BBC's 25,000 employees forced nearly all 
live programs on the corporation's four national radio networks and two 
television channels to be canceled or shortened. This affected half the 
nation's non-cable television and all national radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC radio canceled its World Service, which broadcasts all over the globe, 
with morning news commentary programs, financial reports and the daily review 
of the British press. 
</P>
<P>
The strike began at midnight to demand a 16% pay raise that would bring 
salaries in line with those in commercial broadcasting.

HUSSEIN ACCEPTS RESIGNATION OF PRIME MINISTER

King Hussein accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai today after 
rioting over price increases, an informed source reported. 
</P>
<P>
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave no details, and there was 
no official announcement. Earlier in the day, officials reported that the 
Harvard-educated Rifai, prime minister since 1985, had offered his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan was quoted Sunday as telling a Saudi Arabian newspaper that 
last week's riots would not force a change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riots Began Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
"Government changes are first and foremost a decision of King Hussein and 
dictated by constitutional legitimacy, and cannot take place because of 
demagoguery or pressures exerted on us," the newspaper Al Sharq al Awsat quoted 
the prince as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The four days of riots, in which at least eight people died, began Tuesday in 
the southern city of Maan and spread to dozens of cities and villages 
throughout the kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Rifai has been widely blamed for falling living standards in Jordan. The annual 
per capita income has slumped from about $2,000 in the mid-1980s to about 
$1,200. 
</P>
<P>
The government last year imposed import controls and austerity measures to help 
deal with mounting payments on a $6-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
Rifai, 52, was a boyhood friend of King Hussein who became one of his most 
trusted advisers. No Jordanian prime minister served longer than Rifai. Besides 
the term that began in April, 1985, he also was prime minister from 1973 to 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
Educated at Columbia and Harvard universities, Rifai earlier served as 
ambassador to Britain and as chief of the royal court.

Continental Airlines dropped summer children's air fares today to as low as $1 
round trip, reductions the carrier said could save families up to 55% on their 
total summer air travel. 
</P>
<P>
"We've rewritten the book on children's summer air fares today," said 
Continental spokesman David Messing. "Summer is the time of year when everyone 
plans a big vacation trip with the kids. For a typical family with two kids, 
each of those kids can now travel for as low as $1." 
</P>
<P>
A limited number of the reduced fares are available for purchase now through 
May 26 for travel June 1 through Sept. 10. They can be purchased for children 
ages 2 to 17 when traveling with an adult who has bought a Continental MaxSaver 
ticket, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
The special fares are non-refundable, although Continental said families will 
be allowed to change reservations once at no charge if the destination remains 
the same and appropriate discount seats are available.

DAVIS MODIFIES SUIT ON NWA TAKEOVER DEFENSE

<P>
Billionaire Marvin Davis today revised his lawsuit challenging the "poison 
pill" takeover defense of NWA Inc., the Northwest Airlines' parent company he 
wants to buy in a $2.7-billion hostile tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Del., originally sought to 
invalidate the pill. But at a hearing today, lawyer Gilchrist Sparks said Davis 
is asking only for the elimination of a provision that would prevent a new 
board of directors from dismantling the pill for 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has launched a proxy fight to take control of the board of directors at 
the company's May 15 annual meeting. If he were to succeed, a provision in the 
"poison pill" plan would prevent the new board from dismantling the takeover 
defense for 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
Such a provision would cripple the new board from accepting legitimate buyout 
offers, thus hindering Davis' proxy fight, Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
"Six months is a very long time," Sparks said. "Stockholders want to get the 
money now, not in six months. So they will vote for whoever will get them the 
money now." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor William Allen said he would rule soon on the request. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon Raab, a lawyer for Northwest, objected to the request. He said the 
180-day waiting provision "has the purpose and effect of getting would-be 
acquirers (such as Davis) to come to the board and negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
It is a way of "buying time to get higher bids, explore alternatives to get 
maximum shareholder value," Raab said. "The job of a corporation's director is 
not to shoot himself and his shareholder in the foot," but to make a 
"deliberated" decision on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northwest Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier says he would like a "white 
knight" investor to come forward and work with current management if Northwest 
Airlines cannot remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
Rothmeier told the Wall Street Journal that the best course would be for the 
company to remain independent and follow the growth strategy he has charted for 
the nation's fourth-largest airline. But he said the company is exploring 
putting a large stake in NWA in the hands of friendly investors. 
</P>
<P>
"There are potentially friendly investors out there," said Rothmeier. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' tender offer stands at $90 a share even though the stock has been 
trading well above that price. NWA stock closed Friday at $102.50 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, up $3.75.

A woman who says drinking during pregnancy caused birth defects in her son is 
suing the maker of Jim Beam bourbon for not putting warning labels on its 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection in the lawsuit filed by Candace and Harold Thorp began today in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's 4-year-old son, Michael, was born mentally retarded, 
neurologically impaired and developmentally stunted, with facial and other body 
malformations, according to the lawsuit. The Thorps sued the James B. Beam 
Distillery Co. of Deerfield, Ill., claiming it should have provided labels 
warning that alcohol could cause birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Thorp said in court documents she drank up to a half a fifth per day of Jim 
Beam bourbon while she was pregnant and didn't know her drinking would damage 
her child. 
</P>
<P>
The company asserted in court papers that Washington state law governing 
product liability does not require manufacturers to issue warnings of risks 
that are considered "generally known" by the community.

The Soviet balance of trade worsened in the first three months of the year as 
Western imports rose, according to a report published today in Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter figures from Goskomstat, the state statistics committee, 
showed that the Soviet trade gap widened to 600 million rubles ($960 million) 
from 40 million rubles (64 million) in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some details on the Soviet economy's first-quarter performance were released 
over the weekend by the committee's first deputy chairman, Nikolai Belov. They 
showed wages growing twice as fast as productivity, further unmet demand for 
consumer goods and a slowdown in industrial production. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report in Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, which published the 
full figures, also revealed that first quarter oil production stood at 152 
million metric tons -- 721,000 tons below target. It blamed the poor 
performance of two oil companies for the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Imports outstripped exports by 16.0 billion rubles ($25.6 billion) to 15.4 
billion rubles ($24.6 billion).

Ben Johnson would be welcome to compete in the 1992 Olympics even though he was

IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said Johnson must be treated like any

history. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" Samaranch said when asked if he would like to see Johnson competing 
for a gold medal again. "Johnson was treated like any other athlete in Seoul 
when we suspended him. Now, we have to do the same. . . . He must not get more 
sanctions because he is Johnson. This is not fair."

Samaranch spoke as the Olympic committee's executive board prepared to open 
four days of meetings in this Spanish coastal city, where the 1992 Games will

Ben Johnson's physiotherapist admitted today that he administered what he 
believed were muscle-building steroids to Canadian athletes but said he never 
discussed the topic with Johnson, his teammates or the doctor who supplied the 
banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Waldemar Matuszewski, a surprise witness at the federal inquiry into drug use 
in amateur sport, said he assumed the chemicals he administered were steroids 
but never confirmed that with Dr. Jamie Astaphan, Johnson's physician. 
</P>
<P>
"I never asked, but I knew," Matuszewski told the inquiry. "Only steroids would 
build muscles like that." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with a heavy Polish accent, the Warsaw-born Matuszewski, 42, gave a 
confusing story in which he denied allegations made in earlier testimony that 
he was part of widespread cheating by Johnson and his Canadian teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszewski also denied that he had injected steroids into Italy's top 
sprinter, Pierfrancesco Pavoni, in Toronto in the fall of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testimony Disputed 
</P>
<P>
Pavoni has also described testimony by retired Canadian sprinter Mike 
Sokolowski as "absolutely false." 
</P>
<P>
Sokolowski admitted using steroids and said he saw Matuszewski give Pavoni an 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
Inquiry spokesmen said last week that Peter Dajia, a shot putter once kicked 
off Canada's Commonwealth Games team for failing a drug test, would be the 
first witness when the inquiry resumed after a weeklong break. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected to testify was hurdler Mark McKoy, one of Johnson's closest 
friends who left the Seoul Olympics last year after the star sprinter tested 
positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol and was suspended from 
international competition for two years.

NBC Sports, attracted by the additions of "rookies" Jack Nicklaus and Lee 
Trevino, announced today a multiyear agreement to televise the PGA Seniors 
Championship beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA Seniors Championship, founded in 1937 at Augusta National Golf Club 
with the support of Bobby Jones, is the oldest tournament in senior golf by 
more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino turns 50 Dec. 1 and Nicklaus follows Jan. 21, 1990, making both 
eligible for seniors competition. 
</P>
<P>
NBC Sports President Arthur Watson confirmed that the likelihood of Nicklaus 
and Trevino joining the field influenced the network's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Very much so," he said.

BALLOON ALOFT IN WYOMING IN RACE FROM PALM SPRINGS

<P>
Only one of four helium balloons in an 83-year-old distance race founded by an 
adventure-loving newspaper publisher remained aloft today, floating over 
Wyoming 650 miles from the starting point. 
</P>
<P>
The silvery Jura, piloted by Karl Spenger and Roland Schuler, was spotted at 
11,000 feet at 5:40 a.m., 20 miles from Rock Springs, Wyo., race spokesman 
Harlan Jost said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winner, the bright yellow Rosie O'Grady, touched down at 5 a.m. in 
Evanston, Wyo., about 600 miles from the starting point, while the other two 
entries gave up Sunday afternoon in California and Arizona, Jost said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jost said a winner will not be declared until all the balloons have landed 
because winds might blow the balloon back toward Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The four balloons lifted off into the desert sky at dawn Sunday in the Gordon 
Bennett race, founded in 1906 by New York Herald publisher James Gordon Bennett 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors dumped sand ballast to reach the 12,000-foot level and catch 
easterly winds of up to 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The race is won by the balloon that travels farthest, regardless of where it 
lands. The modern record is 1,346 miles, set in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett originated the "exclusive" news story, financed Henry Stanley's 
expedition to Africa to find David Livingston and backed an ill-fated Arctic 
expedition. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years, the race was held at various places in the United States 
and Europe but was suspended at the outbreak of World War II. It was revived in 
1979 and has originated in Palm Springs since 1984.

TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE FROM BON JOVI IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Let it never be said that Bon Jovi didn't play with spirit and honest 
directness Saturday night at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was, it wasn't until the encore that those qualities emerged, 
and more than half the band was off stage taking a breather at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The high point of the show was "Ride Cowboy Ride," a simple, straightforward 
acoustic strum-and-harmony number played and sung by leader Jon Bon Jovi and 
guitarist Richie Sambora. 
</P>
<P>
On that number, Bon Jovi dispensed with the flash pots and white phosphorous 
explosions that the band found necessary at several points in the show. It also 
set aside the overdone synthesizer and organ flourishes, the thudding beats and 
the metal-guitar whinnying that are the staples of the Bon Jovi sound. It was 
just two guys singing into a microphone together with a lot of heart and 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
The moment proved fleeting: Sambora, backed by wind machine synthesizer 
effects, was soon off on a mannered, portentous acoustic guitar snooze that led 
into "Wanted Dead or Alive." But a good, tough run-through of "Bad Medicine" -- 
the show's second and last highlight -- put a decent cap on things. 
</P>
<P>
There were no such peaks during the body of the concert. Bon Jovi churned out 
routine arena rock, filtered through a murky sound mix. Songs like "Wild in the 
Streets" and "Blood on Blood" found this multiplatinum New Jersey band 
recycling Springsteenesque themes of comradeship and singing with a Bruce-like 
husk. But those songs were overblown and formulaic. 
</P>
<P>
Bon Jovi (which headlines the Forum on Tuesday and Wednesday) seems to have its 
eye on some of the musical roots that underlie Springsteen's music and other 
rock traditions apart from pop-metal. The show included brief snippets of "Save 
the Last Dance for Me" and "Walk Away Renee," as well as instrumental allusions 
to the O'Jays' "For the Love of Money" and Eric Clapton's pomp-and-circumstance 
arrangement of "Little Wing" by Jimi Hendrix. Mostly though, it sounded as if 
Bon Jovi were trying to speak a language without fully knowing yet what it 
means. 
</P>
<P>
Opening band Skid Row's front man, Sebastian Bach, spoke a language that can't 
be printed. The Jersey metal band's set was a poorly sung, indifferently played 
recitation of nearly every bad-boy rocker cliche. Skid Row likes to claim an 
affinity for "the street." Indeed, this obnoxious band had as much originality 
and personality as a slab of asphalt.
