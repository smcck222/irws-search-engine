COURT ORDERS NEW SPY TRIAL FOR FBI AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard W. Miller, the bumbling FBI agent whose love affair with a Russian spy 
landed him in federal prison for two life terms, was granted a new trial 
Tuesday by a federal appeals court that ruled that jurors were allowed to hear 
too much testimony about his lie detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing the conviction of the first FBI agent ever accused of espionage, the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that jurors had been exposed to 
"overwhelming potential prejudice" when told repeatedly that Miller had failed 
polygraph questions about whether he passed U.S. secrets to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 51, was convicted by a Los Angeles federal jury in June, 1986, for 
passing FBI secrets to the Soviet KGB during an adulterous affair with Soviet 
emigre Svetlana Ogorodnikova. The portly agent, Ogorodnikova and her husband 
all are serving federal prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setback for Government 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling was a stinging setback for the 
government and U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who presided over the 
Miller case. It constituted the first reversal of a major espionage conviction 
in a series of more than five dozen prosecutions since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have already tried the 20-year veteran agent twice on the 
charges. The first trial, which spanned three months during 1985, ended in a 
mistrial when jurors deadlocked after three weeks of deliberations. The second 
trial ran four months. Miller has already served 4 1/2 years of a sentence of 
two life terms plus 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are likely to seek a rehearing before a full, 11-member en banc 
panel of the court and could also appeal the reversal to the Supreme Court -- a 
process that could take another 18 months. Defense lawyers said they will move 
"very shortly" to have Miller released on bail pending any new trial. 
</P>
<P>
But privately, many of those closest to the case wondered whether the 
government would ever take the lengthy, complex and emotional case -- a major 
drain on both the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI bureau in Los Angeles for 
several years -- to a jury again. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner personally spent seven months in court prosecuting 
Miller, the only case he has ever personally tried as the region's chief 
federal prosecutor. Now, Bonner has been nominated to a federal judgeship and 
will soon be leaving the office. 
</P>
<P>
His co-prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Russell Hayman, is in the midst of a 
major, billion-dollar money-laundering case and has told some associates that 
he would consider leaving the office rather than prosecute Miller again. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI chief who headed the Los Angeles office during Miller's tenure on the 
Soviet counterintelligence squad has retired. One FBI source told The Times 
that there is some sentiment within the bureau against tying up staff during 
another lengthy trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the case said it is likely the reversal will spawn a new round 
of plea negotiations, under which Miller might agree to plead guilty to some 
petty bribery and embezzlement charges in exchange for a reduced prison term. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Charges 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some sources said Tuesday that they doubt that the 
government could accept such a plea bargain because of the far more serious 
nature of the original charges against Miller and his position as a former FBI 
agent accused of betraying his country. 
</P>
<P>
"We are reviewing the opinion and will be considering a variety of options," 
including an appeal, Bonner said in a prepared statement. "We will in all 
probability make a decision within the next several weeks. Ultimately, if 
necessary, we intend to retry the case." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's lawyers, Joel Levine and Stanley I. Greenberg, said they could not 
discuss the opinion until they had read it. Both were jubilant about the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy, and a little frustrated that we've had to wait this long with 
a client in custody to receive a fair trial," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Greenberg: "The fact that Miller's conviction was reversed should come as 
absolutely no surprise to any fair and impartial observer of the Miller 
proceedings. The prosecution brought to the proceedings an 
end-justifies-the-means mentality that I have never witnessed in over 20 years 
of practicing law." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's lawyers were not optimistic, however, about the chances of a plea 
bargain that might eliminate the need for a third trial. Levine said he expects 
all parties involved will end up fighting the case again in U.S. District 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" Levine asked. "If you don't get it right the first two or three 
times, you do it again. I'd like to think not, but I'm afraid that will be the 
case. I'm sure a settlement needs to be explored, but I'm not sure to what 
degree either side can really negotiate. I don't think there is that much of a 
middle ground that we could agree on." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, according to his lawyers, had expected the reversal and took the news 
calmly when told about it by telephone at a small federal prison for 
white-collar offenders in Minnesota, where he has been confined for most of his 
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was prepared for this," Levine said. "He was happy about it, but 
not wildly. He's an understated guy. He sort of takes convictions, reversals, 
anything that happens to him the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, an excommunicated Mormon and father of eight who was constantly in 
trouble as an agent, claimed his relations with Ogorodnikova and her husband, 
Nikolai, were an attempt to become a secret double agent, penetrate a KGB spy 
ring, come back to his superiors with the news in what he called "a blaze of 
glory" and rescue his failing FBI career. 
</P>
<P>
But the government claimed the 250-pound agent believed he was about to be 
fired for obesity and agreed to pass a confidential U.S. intelligence 
assessment to Ogorodnikova in exchange for sex, $65,000 in gold and cash and a 
$675 Burberry trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
Miller met the tempestuous emigre Ogorodnikova in 1984 when she contacted the 
FBI and claimed to have valuable information. Almost immediately, they became 
lovers. Shortly after returning from a trip to the Soviet Union, Ogorodnikova 
asked Miller to provide her with classified documents. He, in turn, asked her 
for $15,000 in cash and $50,000 in gold -- contending later that he solicited 
the money only to "play along." 
</P>
<P>
Both Ogorodnikova and her husband eventually pleaded guilty to espionage 
charges. She was sentenced to 18 years in prison after admitting as part of a 
sealed court record that Miller had indeed passed her a confidential 
intelligence document. But in dramatic testimony at Miller's trial, 
Ogorodnikova proclaimed Miller "is not a traitor of his country" and denied 
getting any documents from her former lover. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal, written by Judge Dorothy W. Nelson of Los Angeles, was not wholly 
unexpected; at a hearing last July, the judges had asked extraordinarily 
pointed questions about the polygraph evidence. Any other result would have 
required two of the 9th Circuit's most liberal judges -- Nelson and Judge 
Stephen Reinhardt of Los Angeles -- to create new law broadening the 
government's ability to use polygraph evidence in criminal cases. Judge 
Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain of Portland, Ore., a Reagan appointee, joined in the 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue was evidence prosecutors presented that Miller, during five days 
of intense interrogation by his FBI superiors, had failed several polygraph 
tests. After he was informed of the results and demanded to speak with another 
polygraph examiner, Miller made several damaging admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors did not attempt to introduce the polygraph tests until Miller's 
lawyers challenged the reliability of his admissions, contending they were the 
products of a distraught, tired man who had been pressured by his 
interrogators. At that point, government lawyers argued, it was necessary to 
introduce the lie detector tests to show the sequence of events in which Miller 
ultimately made the admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's "most damaging admissions were made after he had been informed that he 
had failed the polygraph tests," Hayman argued in his appeal brief. "That fact 
is powerful evidence that these admissions were made in response to his failure 
of the polygraph test, rather than due to any overbearing of his will by his 
interviewers." 
</P>
<P>
But during the trial, the appeals court noted, Judge Kenyon allowed agents to 
testify in detail about the full battery of questions and answers recorded in 
the lie detector tests -- not just the fact that Miller had failed them. And 
this, they found, was a crucial overstep. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that polygraph tests are rarely admissible in federal cases, the court 
concluded: "Compared to the overwhelming potential prejudice, the marginal 
probative value of this additional detailed testimony was slight indeed." It is 
"more likely than not," the panel said, that the jury's verdict was affected by 
the polygraph evidence despite the judge's instruction cautioning jurors about 
the unreliability of polygraph results. 
</P>
<P>
The court also sided with the defense's complaints about the testimony of John 
Barron, an expert in KGB recruitment tactics who testified that the Soviets 
typically target people who are socially isolated, frustrated in their careers, 
dishonest or sexually promiscuous. The defense had argued that Barron's 
testimony, offered as general description of KGB tactics, instead was tailored 
to fit the Miller case. 
</P>
<P>
The court held that the government "clearly invited" jurors to use Barron's 
testimony as character evidence unfairly prejudicial to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The court also rejected the admission of evidence showing previous dishonesty 
by Miller, specifically testimony that Miller had in 1982 secretly sold 
Department of Motor Vehicles driver's license information to a private 
investigator. Government lawyers argued that the past arrangement made it more 
probable that he had a criminal intent in soliciting money from the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wholly Dissimilar' 
</P>
<P>
But the appellate judges said that while the evidence might be relevant to a 
separate series of bribery counts, the intent involved in selling secrets to a 
foreign government is "wholly dissimilar" from the intent involved in selling 
driver's license information. 
</P>
<P>
On at least nine other points challenged by the defense, the appeals court 
upheld Kenyon's rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Miller's arrest in 1984, Kenyon had agreed to sever eight bribery 
and embezzlement counts against the ex-agent from the espionage case. Those 
charges, including claims that Miller took money for selling FBI information 
and that he embezzled funds from a partly blind FBI informant, can be 
reinstated and used in negotiating any possible plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI had no official response to the reversal. Richard T. Bretzing, the 
former special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office during much of 
Miller's tenure, said only that he was "surprised" by the reversal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that there's anything to say," he said. "Obviously the Court of 
Appeals has made its ruling. . . . I don't think I would say I was 
disappointed. The wheels of justice have turned."

BUSH TAKES ANTI-DRUG EFFORT TO SMUGGLING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Tuesday used more than $4 million in seized cash and the dry, 
brown hills of a reputed drug smuggler's confiscated ranch in southern Orange 
County as background for a stern anti-drug message, declaring that the nation's 
efforts "won't stop until we nail every coward who deals in death and put them 
all where they belong." 
</P>
<P>
Helicoptering into Rancho del Rio in the Santa Ana foothills southeast of El 
Toro, Bush, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, Customs Commissioner William von Raab 
and Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates praised the work of law enforcement agents 
and a federal law that allows officials to confiscate assets from drug dealers 
and turn them over to drug-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
And posing in front of a large mound of seized cash -- 10s, 20s, 50s and 100s 
-- and bags representing seized drugs, Bush called on Southern California's 
entertainment community to increase its anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"You've raised your voices so effectively in the cause of so many issues," he 
said. "Can you not raise them once more, in support of a cause so important?" 
</P>
<P>
The need for entertainment industry figures to become more involved in drug 
fighting has become a repeated theme for Bush. "Television, music and film are 
a positive influence," Bush said. "My entreaty is, use that influence wisely -- 
to do good. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want to see a movie again that makes drug use into something humorous. 
It is time that they got behind this crusade." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, Bush traveled to UCLA for a meeting with a mostly 
Republican group of Latino community leaders, thanking them for their support 
in last fall's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"As America's fastest-growing minority in the 21st Century," Bush said, Latinos 
"more than ever will help tell the American story." 
</P>
<P>
But, although the hastily organized Latino event was an opportunity for Bush to 
pay back a political debt, the main emphasis of the afternoon was on drug 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California, Bush told his audience at Rancho del Rio, is "one of the 
largest and toughest drug markets in the country." Drug-related incidents take 
the life of one person every other day in Orange County, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials charge that a large share of the area's drug traffic was 
masterminded from the 213-acre Rancho del Rio until it was raided in July, 
1985. Prosecutors subsequently persuaded a federal judge to declare the ranch 
forfeited under terms of the federal Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which 
allows the government to seize the proceeds of illegal drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. Fowlie, the ranch's former owner, was indicted last November on 26 
felony counts and is in jail in Mexico fighting extradition. The ranch has been 
turned over to Orange County by the federal government for possible use as a 
law enforcement training center. 
</P>
<P>
"These houses and buildings that would have given respite and comfort to 
dealers of death" will now be used "to win more victories," Gates said, as he 
introduced Bush to the crowd of several hundred area law enforcement officials 
and dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said: "There is justice and there is poetic justice, and we are here 
to observe both." 
</P>
<P>
Asset forfeiture laws have become one of the most powerful weapons in the 
government's anti-drug fight. Because the standards of proof are lower in 
forfeiture cases than in criminal proceedings, prosecutors often find seizing 
assets alleged to be drug-related considerably easier than convicting dealers 
and smugglers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the forfeiture laws have become a major source of equipment and 
facilities for police agencies. Since 1984, when the drug forfeiture law was 
enacted, the government has seized about $250 million in drug-related assets, 
Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Before his speech, Bush toured part of the facility with Thornburgh and Gates, 
inspecting lavish furnishings seized from drug dealers, looking over pickup 
trucks with false bottoms used for smuggling and peering into a trap door that 
once concealed a large storage tank for cocaine, marijuana and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"This operation had commercial packing equipment, underground storage vaults, 
large vans with hidden compartments, jet aircraft, oceangoing vessels," he said 
later. "Once a warehouse of death, now it is a source of hope." 
</P>
<P>
Bush presented Gates with a check for $4.3 million, representing the county's 
share of the proceeds forfeited by Fowlie. At the end of his speech, he signed 
an anti-drug pledge card, then accepted a black-and-white jacket with the 
anti-drug slogan "Drug Use is Life Abuse" emblazoned on it.

REPORTERS ON TV; 
</P>
<P>
IS STARDOM WEAKENING THE PRESS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He made no secret about it. Chris Matthews wanted to be a pundit, a player, a 
face on the Sunday political talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
He discussed it with friends when he was speech writer and spokesman for House 
Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., and he even described writing his book, 
"Hardball," as a way of establishing his credentials. 
</P>
<P>
So, two years ago, he and executive editor Larry Kramer of the San Francisco 
Examiner struck a deal to make it happen. Matthews would become an Examiner 
columnist, complete with the prestigious title of Washington bureau chief. "He 
needed to be a journalist," Kramer explains now, "to have the kind of 
respectability to be on TV. That's what we brought to the table." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Talent for TV 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Matthews brought the talents that work on TV. Kramer needed 
visibility for his afternoon newspaper, and Matthews could provide that by 
appearing on "any one of the 50 shows . . . with our name under his picture." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the success of their bargain offers a lesson -- disturbing to some -- 
about the growing importance of appearing on television if one is to be 
considered important and influential in print. 
</P>
<P>
Even though few in Washington see his column, Matthews has become such a 
familiar face on the TV talk shows that, earlier this year, Washingtonian 
magazine named him "one of the top 50 journalists," in the city. Says Kramer, 
with the candor of an editor who knows business: "I should be paying him out of 
the marketing budget." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coaches for Television 
</P>
<P>
The Matthews case is not the only sign of the times. The Chicago Tribune now 
employs a media consultant to coach and promote its Washington correspondents 
for television. USA Today regularly features its newspaper reporters as experts 
on its TV show, hoping that one helps sell the other. And when one newspaper 
chain recently asked columnist Jack Germond to recommend candidates for 
Washington bureau chief, it noted that being a regular on TV was a 
prerequisite. 
</P>
<P>
"When that happens," said Germond, "things have clearly gotten screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
Some reporters fear the culture of the TV programs may even be changing the 
basic values of print journalism, downgrading by degrees the traditional skills 
of reporting, neutrality and objectivity while elevating the skills that get 
one and keep one on TV -- a knack for asserting opinions, a talent for thinking 
in sound bites rather than nuance, and a skill for honing an attention-getting 
public persona. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of TV opinion journalism, some worry, may go deeper yet: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is it making public discourse more rancorous, for instance, if the rewards 
go to those willing to stake out more controversial positions? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is it mirroring the devaluation of substance that has occurred in politics 
if reporters' interpretations of events become more important than covering the 
events? 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, when print journalists who appear on TV become as well known as the 
officials they cover, does that move the press away from the arm's-length, 
sometimes adversarial relationship with government that was underscored with 
coverage of Vietnam and Watergate? 
</P>
<P>
"It is a whole new world," said Sue Ducat, producer of "Washington Week in 
Review." "The whole phenomenon of journalists realizing that visibility can 
boost their careers in a number of ways has really taken off." 
</P>
<P>
Ducat, in fact, is inundated with requests from print reporters who want to 
appear on the show. Some send her same-day faxes of their stories; others 
deliver videotapes of their previous TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
So powerful is television's invisible wave, the medium changes not only the 
message but also the messenger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Changing Format 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of print reporters on TV is hardly new. "Meet the Press," which 
uses reporters to interview politicians, is NBC's longest-running show, and 
"Washington Week in Review" 22 years ago began having newspaper and 
newsmagazine journalists report and then analyze the week's news. 
</P>
<P>
But the rise of the political talk programs more rightly dates back about 10 
years, to when "Agronsky &amp; Co." and later "This Week with David Brinkley" 
started asking reporters not merely to interview officials and offer a little 
analysis, but to assert their own opinions flat out. 
</P>
<P>
The success of such shows soon led to reporter round tables on "Face the 
Nation," "The Today Show," "Nightline" and others. Today, the National 
Journal's guide to Washington lists 21 public affairs programs that have print 
reporters as guests. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, TV audience-share figures suggest that the more gusto reporters 
give their opinions, the better. "Agronsky," for instance, was quickly 
overwhelmed in the ratings by "The McLaughlin Group," a kind of 
opinion-entertainment program that appears on both commercial and PBS stations. 
And that has influenced others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Faces for the Nation 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin regulars Patrick Buchanan and Robert Novak recently started CNN's 
"Capitol Gang" in the McLaughlin mold. Even CBS' venerable "Face the Nation" 
now has two kinds of round tables, executive producer Karen Sughrue said, "one 
where we use people as analysts -- 'Do you think Jim Wright will last?' -- and 
others where we ask 'Should he last?' " 
</P>
<P>
To many in print journalism these shows do not signal anything dangerous. For 
one thing, only about 50 print reporters appear regularly on TV, and most of 
them are veterans at reporting who seem unlikely to be corrupted by the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, if people don't take the shows seriously, some argue, they pose no 
danger. The key, said Germond, a nationally syndicated political columnist and 
regular on the televised McLaughlin show, is whether people recognize that "it 
is a half hour of being a dancing bear to make a better living and . . . not a 
serious journalistic exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Not all participants consider themselves dancing bears -- "It is just a 
different kind of journalism," said fellow McLaughlinite and New Republic 
writer Fred Barnes. And many say that to dismiss the TV programs as mere 
entertainment is self-deluding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Books, Speaking Tours 
</P>
<P>
At least in degrees, TV already has changed which print journalists are 
rewarded and why. Although payment for a single appearance on most shows ranges 
from $200 to $1,000, being on TV today is the surest way for a print reporter 
to get rich. It leads to book contracts and, most lucrative of all, to the 
lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Lecture circuit appearances have become sufficiently common that they now are 
an issue in the Senate press gallery, which grants credentials to reporters 
covering Congress. The gallery has long limited press passes to those whose 
primary income comes from a news organization. Today, many long-standing press 
gallery members are making so much money speaking that they no longer qualify, 
and there is pressure to change the rules. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery that TV can turn reporters into sought-after celebrities has not 
been lost on the news organizations they work for, either. Today reporters who 
appear on television can command better assignments, more prestige within their 
organizations and higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek, which gives reporters cash bonuses for television appearances, hired 
Morton M. Kondracke as Washington bureau chief after he became a regular on TV, 
just as U.S. News &amp; World Report found an editor in TV commentator David 
Gergen. (Kondracke has since returned to the New Republic; Gergen remains at 
U.S. News as editor at large but is no longer the editor.) 
</P>
<P>
Several prominent bureau chiefs in Washington also appear regularly on 
television. They include Jack Nelson of The Times, on "Washington Week in 
Review," Albert Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, on the "Capital Gang," and 
Strobe Talbott of Time magazine, on "Inside Washington" (formerly "Agronsky 
&amp; Co."). 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' career may be the most unusual. Examiner Editor Kramer not only found 
someone he thought would be good on TV and gave him the title of bureau chief 
-- though his domain is just himself and one reporter -- Kramer also arranged 
to have Matthews' column syndicated by King Features. He says that was "the 
only way to get even half" of what Matthews had been making as a Washington 
consultant. Matthews now has more than 60 client papers, many of them picked up 
when the King syndicate's other liberal writer, Nicholas Von Hoffman, stopped 
writing his column. 
</P>
<P>
Many publications, such as U.S. News and USA Today, see having their reporters 
on television as good business. They believe having them on the air will 
persuade readers to buy their publications. 
</P>
<P>
And some editors think it helps their staffs do their jobs. The Chicago 
Tribune, for instance, pays its reporters' TV coach out of its news budget. "We 
don't circulate heavily in this town," Washington bureau chief Nicholas Horrock 
said. But the TV talk programs do, so appearing on the shows enhances access to 
sources for the Tribune's correspondents in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times' policy concerning TV appearances is about the most 
restrictive of any news organization, and it asks only that a reporter not 
"appear with the frequency that would suggest you have become a regular" on any 
one program, according to Assistant Managing Editor Warren Hoge. Yet how often 
is too often is decided case by case, and in the case of really big-name 
reporters, according to TV producers, it gets a little fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times also asks its reporters not to become regulars on any 
program, the editor, Shelby Coffey III, said. Nelson's appearances on 
"Washington Week," according to Coffey, comply with the policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Values Under Question 
</P>
<P>
To some, the institutional rewards TV appearances can bring send a signal to 
all print journalists, a signal that bears examining. "What bothers me is the 
message (in part) of what it is we value and esteem," said Washington Post 
writer David Broder. 
</P>
<P>
And the values that at least some TV programs esteem are not necessarily those 
that make a good print reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"I need someone who is glib, colorful, whose thoughts can be condensed into a 
conversational style," "Face the Nation" executive producer Karen Sughrue says. 
</P>
<P>
Other producers mentioned irreverence, wit, a colorful manner or an ability to 
spark "a good fight," or, as McLaughlin producer Kennedy put it, "someone who 
is not afraid to go out on a limb." 
</P>
<P>
In the climate of at least a few of the shows, some journalists say, staking 
out a point on the political spectrum seems more important than finding an 
argument that is reasoned or persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
And journalist Hodding Carter III wonders about "the effect on public 
discourse, generally. Do Americans think they are getting anything of substance 
from any of this?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stirring Up Rancor 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the New York Review of Books two years ago, reporter James Fallows 
suggested that the values of the talk shows were making public debate more 
rancorous if, to build audiences, the shows were rewarding those who made for a 
good fight rather than a plausible argument. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything depends on the tone of the show," argued Broder, echoing a widely 
held sentiment. Are reporters showing up on TV to analyze why things happened 
or "in the role of policy advocates" saying what should happen? 
</P>
<P>
With the success of the more entertaining shows, even that distinction may be 
getting blurry. How many viewers, for instance, recognize the difference 
between the advocative versus the merely analytical panels on "Face the 
Nation"? 
</P>
<P>
To those who participate in the programs, the most obvious danger is that the 
more lucrative side of their activities comes from something other than 
reporting. And the more one wants to build one's empire, the less time one has 
to cover the beat. 
</P>
<P>
"We both know there are a lot of people in this town who write columns and 
engage in journalism on the run," said Paul Duke, moderator of PBS' "Washington 
Week in Review." 
</P>
<P>
Again, it may come down to how seriously journalists and the public take the 
political talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
Those who appear on the programs sometimes talk about having a sense that their 
words vanish like soap bubbles; they say that people who recognize them from 
their TV appearances rarely comment on what they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It all invites a sort of lazy opinion-mongering," said Rolling Stone 
Washington editor William Greider, who has appeared on the the programs. "My 
sense," Greider said, "is that some people are confusing it with reporting." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, at least, is quite open in his attitude toward reporting: he rarely 
does any for the twice-weekly column and weekly analysis that he writes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think interviewing people or doing basic snooping is that much of a 
pure form of information-gathering," Matthews explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Job Definition 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he believes that, "Every time I give a speech I get challenged, or 
every time I talk on TV. The process of writing is formative, and to say that 
you are not thinking, not developing information, I don't think that is valid." 
</P>
<P>
It is a novel approach -- a journalist who doesn't believe in doing reporting 
-- but Matthews goes further. He describes what he does -- on TV, in lectures 
or in print -- as providing audiences with a "colorful expose," a term that 
once meant investigative reporting. 
</P>
<P>
It is an attitude, in a sense, that reflects what has occurred in political 
campaigns: The way an event is interpreted can have more effect than the event 
itself. In the new news-media culture, in which reporters' opinions are more 
highly rewarded than their ability to uncover what has happened, the "spin" put 
on events becomes more important than the events themselves. 
</P>
<P>
There is also one other problem with the rise of the shows and their influence, 
said Broder of the Post. The programs are helping to blur the line between 
journalists and the officials they cover, he says. This raises the danger of 
journalists allowing themselves "to become androgynous Washington insiders," as 
he put it in a speech last December, "all of us seeking and wielding influence 
in our own ways." 
</P>
<P>
The journalist as Washington insider -- rendering opinions, offering advice -- 
is indeed part of the ethos of these programs. 
</P>
<P>
And now some of the shows also mix journalists with partisans and officials as 
equal players on their panels. 
</P>
<P>
On "Capital Gang," not only does the "gang" make no distinction between Patrick 
Buchanan, conservative advocate and sometime government official, and Al Hunt, 
Wall Street Journal Washington bureau chief, but each week, a different 
politician joins the panel as an equal, not as a guest to be queried. "Welcome, 
Charlie," Buchanan tells Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), insider to insider. 
</P>
<P>
Even on the more staid programs, the symbols of distance between reporter and 
official are no longer considered important. Gone are the desks that once 
separated the supposed interrogators from their subject on "Meet the Press" or 
"Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
Greider, of Rolling Stone, worries that the ethos of the Washington 
celebrity-insider on screen "translates into a sort of social corruption" off 
screen, in which journalists become the social equals of the officials they 
cover, in effect, "distancing themselves from the public." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendships With Sources 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that where you develop special relationships 
(with officials) that there are times when you are willing to turn a blind eye 
to minor criticisms," said John McLaughlin, a former White House aide now best 
known for his TV program. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter does that, he argues, "in order to preserve a source for a major 
expose or major policy issue . . . . It is a question of preserving the 
connection for the greater good." 
</P>
<P>
To others, such as New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, this kind of talk is 
a dangerous sign that the press is becoming weaker and less responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"The established press in this country has to a large extent reverted" to an 
old relationship with government, Lewis argues, that predates Vietnam and 
Watergate. "We are an adversary only on the margins, not on the fundamentals 
that challenge power." 
</P>
<P>
The celebrity status of the press is only one factor, Lewis believes, but it is 
a problem, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Top 50' Analyzed 
</P>
<P>
Whether Lewis is right or not, the political talk shows have left their mark on 
print journalism. Though it was a self-appointed and subjective judge, 
Washingtonian magazine's selection of the "50 most influential journalists" in 
the Capital this year included only nine print reporters who did not appear on 
television. Another 11 were editors or bureau chiefs included by virtue of 
their jobs. The other 30 were all TV reporters or print reporters who regularly 
appeared on television. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't prove this," said Barbara Matusow, the author of the Washingtonian 
article who, with the editors of the magazine, compiled the list of influential 
journalists' names. "But I really think that you find young people in print 
journalism hustling themselves as a product . . . in a way you wouldn't have 
before . . . . The pot of gold is so much bigger today (than ever before), it 
is just unimaginable."

CHENEY SEEKING $10 BILLION IN PENTAGON CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, heralding what he called "a fundamental shift in 
direction" for the American military, presented Congress Tuesday with a plan 
for cutting $10 billion from the Pentagon budget proposed by former President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In only his 40th day in office, Cheney called for billion-dollar reductions for 
the high-technology B-2 stealth bomber and the "Star Wars" missile shield. He 
proposed canceling the $26-billion V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft program and killing 
or significantly delaying 17 other major weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney termed the proposed cuts "very, very painful" but said that there is no 
way to balance the budget "without offending somebody, without breaking some 
china, without stepping on some toes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fifth Straight Year 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's budget -- $305 billion for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1 
-- contains a 1% reduction after inflation from the current year's spending 
plan. It marks the fifth consecutive year of real declines in defense spending, 
which has fallen 12% short of keeping pace with inflation since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But the $10 billion in reductions for 1990 represents only a down payment on a 
total of $64 billion that Cheney must pare from Reagan's military spending 
goals over the next five years to meet the Bush Administration's 
deficit-reduction targets. 
</P>
<P>
The truly tough decisions lie ahead in a strategic review that the 
Administration plans to complete this year. Cheney and President Bush must 
confront what America expects from its military, how many men and women in 
uniform the country needs, what weapons they should be given -- and how the 
nation plans to pay for all of it. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not easy decisions," the former Wyoming congressman told the House 
Armed Services Committee. "If anyone thinks it's pleasant, with my record of 
unqualified support for the Defense Department and the (military) services and 
the various systems that we've voted for over the years, it's tough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But we do have to make some of these calls. I hope we'll do it in an 
intelligent fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the Cheney proposals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Place the existing 50 silo-based MX intercontinental ballistic missiles on 
rail cars and continue developing the truck-borne single-warhead Midgetman 
missile. Cheney, who had urged killing the Midgetman, followed President Bush's 
orders and recommended spending $100 million on the small missile in 1990, 
rising to $350 million in 1994. The mobile MX would be deployed in 1992; the 
first of 500 Midgetmen would hit the roads in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cut Reagan's proposed spending level for "Star Wars," the Strategic Defense 
Initiative, by $991 million to $4.6 billion, with increased emphasis on the 
so-called "Brilliant Pebbles" concept of swarms of thousands of "smart" rocket 
interceptors roaming in space to spot and destroy incoming Soviet missiles. 
Cheney proposed reducing spending on SDI to $33 billion from Reagan's $40 
billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Slash spending on the stealth bomber, being built by Northrop Corp. in 
Palmdale, by $855 million in 1990 and $3.2 billion in 1991, while delaying 
production of the super-secret high-tech plane by at least a year. Referring to 
unspecified technical problems with the flying-wing jet, Cheney said that he 
has ordered a full-scale review of the $69-billion program. (Related story in 
Business, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Continue development and early production of the Air Force's C-17 transport 
plane, to be built by McDonnell Douglas Corp. at Long Beach. The Air Force had 
proposed stretching out production of the plane, but Cheney rejected the 
recommendation. The Army's M1-A1 Abrams tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle 
were also saved from proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reduce active-duty military manpower by 16,800 men and women, to 2,121,000 
troops. An additional 14,000 troops would be cut in 1991. Of the 1990 cuts, 
8,000 would come from the Army, 5,600 from the Navy and 3,200 from the Air 
Force. Cheney left intact a proposed 3.6% pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cancel further purchases of the Army's AH-64 Apache helicopter and the 
Advanced Helicopter Improvement Program or AHIP. That would save $3.2 billion 
and reduce planned helicopter inventories by 324 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kill the Army's M-88 recovery vehicle, a glorified tow truck for tanks, 
saving about $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cancel purchases of the Navy's new F-14D fighter jets. The Navy would 
continue to refurbish older models of the F-14. The Phoenix missile that would 
arm the new F-14s would also be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy only one more Los Angeles-class SSN-688 submarine, rather than two, for 
a savings of $714 million. Cheney also denied the Navy's request to go from 14 
to 15 aircraft carrier battle groups; the old carrier Coral Sea will be retired 
in 1991 and not replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kill the Air Force F-15E fighter program, eliminating 89 new jets and 
saving about $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scale back development of the National Aerospace Plane, cutting its 1990 
budget to $100 million from $300 million. The hyperspeed plane, half aircraft 
and half spaceship, is designed to circle the globe in hours and land on 
conventional airstrips. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stretch out purchases of a variety of weapons including the Army's ADATS 
and ATACMS missiles and UH-60 helicopter, the Navy's SH-60F helicopter and 
F/A-18 fighter-bomber and the Air Force's Tacit Rainbow radar-seeking missile. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also proposed eliminating two mine-hunting ships and 48 T-45 trainer 
jets. The secretary's recommendations probably will be reworked radically by 
Congress in coming months. Supporters of terminated weapons will labor to save 
them -- and the jobs they provide. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to shuffle money around within the $305-billion spending 
limit decreed by the congressional budget committees. Lawmakers predicted that 
opponents of SDI, for example, will attempt to raid its fat budget to fund pet 
projects, such as the Midgetman missile. 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), dismayed at the low 
initial funding levels for Midgetman, asked for Cheney's promise that the 
Administration would build the small missile after it completed work on the MX 
rail program. "As far as the President is concerned . . . this is a firm 
commitment," Cheney responded. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
issued the usual dire warnings about the continuing menance posed by the 
Soviets and other unfriendly nations. 
</P>
<P>
"For several years, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been testifying that the 
military risk is in their judgment too high," said Crowe, the nation's senior 
uniformed officer. "Yet for another year, defense spending will continue 
downward in real terms; force structure will decrease and military risks will 
rise by even another increment." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers attempted to elevate parochial concerns into issues of global 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the V-22 -- whether former members of the Marine Corps, the chief 
user of the plane, or representatives from Texas, where it is being built -- 
argued that the aircraft is essential to protecting American lives and 
interests in the remotest corners of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William L. Dickinson (R-Ala.), the ranking Republican on the panel, 
summarized lawmakers' reaction this way: 
</P>
<P>
"Some think you've cut too much. Some think you've cut too little. Everybody 
thinks you cut the wrong thing."

JUSTICES RULE USER FEES ARE NOT TAXES, AVERTING $22-BILLION BUDGET HEADACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, sparing Congress and the Bush Administration a big budget 
headache, ruled unanimously Tuesday that government "user fees" are not taxes 
and therefore may be imposed by federal agencies without being enacted into 
law. 
</P>
<P>
If the decision had gone the other way, it could have threatened as much as $22 
billion in fees collected by various federal agencies, ranging from the Coast 
Guard to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
An adverse ruling also would have greatly complicated federal budget 
negotiators' efforts to reduce the deficit this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Way to Hike Revenue 
</P>
<P>
In most instances, Congress passes a law authorizing the charging of fees in a 
regulated industry and leaves it up to the agency to decide who pays exactly 
what. Recently, congressional leaders and the Bush White House have talked of 
adding new "user fees" as an attractive way of increasing revenue without 
raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the justices, overturning a lower court ruling in Oklahoma, said 
that the current method of handling user fees is legal. 
</P>
<P>
"So long as Congress provides an administrative agency with standards guiding 
its action," the agency officials can take on the authority to set specific 
fees, wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation of authority for setting fees for some government services had 
been challenged by such groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National 
Assn. of Manufacturers and the National Taxpayers Assn., which charged that 
this way of raising money was both unwise and unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
In briefs to the high court, they said that the Constitution does not permit 
legislators to hide behind bureaucrats imposing fees and instead requires them 
to pass laws prescribing the amount charged and who must pay. Moreover, they 
said that the fees charged by agencies such as the NRC and the SEC actually pay 
for the operation of the agency itself, and thus should be considered taxes and 
not a fee for service. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a district judge in Oklahoma agreed with these arguments and ruled 
unconstitutional a 1985 congressional budget act allowing federal regulators to 
impose "reasonable" fees on users of pipelines carrying natural gas and 
hazardous liquids. The judge concluded that pipeline fees set by the Department 
of Transportation actually are taxes and that the Constitution reserved for 
Congress alone the "power to lay and collect taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Although the pipeline case involved only about $9 million in fees, the Justice 
Department saw the ruling as a potential threat to user fees in general and 
appealed the case (Skinner vs. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 87-2098) directly to 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Longstanding Principle' 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said that her opinion "reaffirmed our longstanding principle" that the 
Constitution permits Congress to delegate to the executive branch the power to 
carry out the details of its laws. 
</P>
<P>
During the New Deal era of the 1930s, this issue provoked a major 
constitutional conflict between the Supreme Court on one side and the 
Democrat-dominated Congress and Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration on the 
other. On several occasions, the conservative court struck down New Deal laws 
on the grounds that it was unconstitutional for Congress to give Roosevelt's 
new agencies the power to regulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1937, however, the high court changed course and accepted the modern 
bureaucratic system in which the lines between regulations and laws, or between 
taxes and fees, are not so clear. In the 52 years since then, the justices have 
not struck down a single law on the grounds that Congress has abdicated its 
constitutional powers to the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an important taxing victory for the Western states, the court 
ruled Tuesday that states may tax businesses for oil and gas taken from Indian 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
On a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld New Mexico's tax on oil corporations 
operating on Indian lands, concluding that this tax does not subject a company 
to illegal multiple taxation nor does it infringe on the rights of Indians 
(Cotton Petroleum vs. New Mexico, 87-1327).

BUSH CHOOSES LUCAS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush announced Tuesday that he will nominate William Lucas, a black 
lawyer who has been criticized by some leading civil rights organizations, to 
head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, former sheriff and chief executive of Michigan's Wayne County, which 
includes Detroit, has a background in law enforcement but virtually no 
experience with federal civil rights laws. His background has led the NAACP, 
among other groups, to oppose his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials, however, have dismissed the opposition, suggesting that 
it is motivated primarily by partisanship. Speaking to reporters Tuesday 
afternoon in Orange County, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh repeated the charge of 
partisanship and gave Lucas a warm endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confidence Declared 
</P>
<P>
"Both the President and I have a great deal of confidence in Bill Lucas' 
integrity, experience and competence," Thornburgh said. "He has lived the civil 
rights story." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, he said, "has the President's full backing and my full backing." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who was once a Democrat, switched to the Republican Party in the early 
1980s and has been one of the few notable examples of success in the GOP 
campaign to seek black support. He ran in 1986 as the GOP candidate to be 
Michigan's governor but lost badly to incumbent Democrat James J. Blanchard. 
</P>
<P>
Although announcement of the nomination long had been anticipated, it was 
delayed for several weeks by background checks. The White House announced the 
decision while Bush was here to deliver a speech on trade and competitiveness 
at a Ford Aerospace plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capital Gains Tax 
</P>
<P>
Bush used the speech to repeat his calls for lower taxes on capital gains -- 
income from the sale of assets such as stocks or bonds. Bush maintains that the 
lower tax rate would spur investment. Democratic critics say it would merely 
line the pockets of the rich and have declared the proposal dead in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' nomination would appear to have a relatively good chance for Senate 
confirmation, despite the opposition from the NAACP. He has received the 
endorsements of a number of prominent politicians, including Rep. John Conyers 
Jr. (D-Mich.), a senior congressional Black Caucus member who represents 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
As assistant attorney general heading the Civil Rights Division, Lucas would 
fill the job held for most of the past eight years by one of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration's most controversial figures, William Bradford Reynolds. 
Reynolds was the architect of many of the Reagan Administration's attempts to 
dismantle traditional federal civil rights remedies.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said Tuesday that his government in the next 
few days will free a small number of political prisoners linked to the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, who is on a 10-nation tour of Western Europe, also said he believes 
that President Bush wants to take a softer line with Nicaragua but is having 
difficulty breaking with the past policies of former President Ronald Reagan, 
whom he called "a liar." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bush is in favor of a negotiated solution, but he is so compromised 
and bound up with the previous policy that it's not easy for him to move away 
from it in the short term," Ortega said in an address to Socialist members of 
the European Community's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega accused the United States of breaking international law and a Central 
American peace agreement by granting fresh humanitarian aid to the Contras 
fighting his Sandinista government. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega said the Contras are continuing to attack Nicaraguan forces even though 
the U.S. aid is supposed to be non-lethal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, "a handful of people linked to the CIA will be freed in the next 
few days," Ortega said. He gave no other details. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic reforms, the release of 1,900 political prisoners and the disbanding 
of the Contras are measures called for under a peace accord signed in February 
by El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, wearing his customary khaki uniform, pledged that presidential, 
parliamentary and municipal elections to be held in Nicaragua next February, a 
key element of the peace plan for the war-ravaged region, will be fair and open 
to the country's 18 opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
He formally invited the European Parliament to send observers. "They can talk 
to anyone, and at the end they can say whether it was a just process or not," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan opposition parties have rejected recent reforms of electoral and 
media laws, charging they give unfair advantages to the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega is visiting Europe to try to win support for Central American peace 
efforts and help in rebuilding a Nicaraguan economy devastated by the 
eight-year war against the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Europe could be a major source of finance for Nicaragua," he said. "We 
don't have access to international (lending) bodies because the United States 
cut us off," he said, referring to Washington's economic embargo against 
Managua. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Ortega met Belgium's King Baudouin and held talks with 
Prime Minister Wilfried Martens on the process of democratization in Central 
America and the European Community's plans for a unified market after 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Martens said further moves towards democracy in Nicaragua are 
a precondition for financial aid from Belgium.

<P>
With its promise of breaking a two-month stalemate in Parliament, Prime 
Minister Noboru Takeshita's declaration that he will resign brought a sense of 
relief to both politics and economics in Japan on Tuesday, even though the 
choice of a successor remained unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rose for the third-largest gain this year on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 
and the yen's value climbed slightly on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party dropped its defensive posture toward an 
opposition boycott of Parliament by resuming deliberations unilaterally on the 
fiscal 1989 budget. In his resignation announcement, Takeshita made passage of 
the budget a condition for stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
Deliberations had been halted Feb. 28 as opposition parties refused to proceed 
unless former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, also of the ruling party, was 
forced to testify about his involvement in the spreading influence-buying 
scandal that eventually brought down Takeshita, his successor. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese in the streets expressed relief, repeating, as if in unison, "It's 
only natural," when asked about Takeshita's surprise announcement in a 
televised news conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apologizes to People 
</P>
<P>
Announcing his intention to resign, the 65-year-old prime minister apologized 
to the people for a scandal involving political contributions and questionable 
stock dealings that has enveloped him, Nakasone and dozens of other 
politicians, bureaucrats and leading businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal centered on the widespread influence-buying activities of Recruit 
Co., a conglomerate with employment agencies, information, computer and real 
estate interests. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation on a successor focused on Masayoshi Ito, 75, chairman of the ruling 
party's executive board. Ito, who is reported to suffer from diabetes, declared 
that a younger leader should be chosen. But when asked if he would accept a 
draft, he said he would "not reply to a hypothetical question." 
</P>
<P>
Ito, who is one of the few ruling party leaders whose name has not been linked 
to the scandal, has a reputation for independence and integrity. Known as a 
"progressive bureaucrat" in the Agriculture Ministry before turning to 
politics, Ito served as foreign minister under former Prime Minister Zenko 
Suzuki until he resigned in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Also mentioned as a possible successor is Masaharu Gotoda, chairman of a ruling 
party committee on political reform. He served as chief Cabinet secretary under 
Nakasone. Gotoda, too, is untainted by Recruit's money. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation of the Recruit scandal by prosecutors is continuing and may 
not end before the Liberal Democrats select a new party president. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of its commanding majority in the lower house, which elects the prime 
minister, the ruling party is ensured of making its president Japan's next 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything could happen in this kind of crisis situation," said Takashi 
Inoguchi, a professor of political science at Tokyo University. 
</P>
<P>
With an election for the upper house of Parliament to be held this summer, a 
leader capable of convincing voters of his determination to clear up the 
Recruit scandal and carry out reform is considered essential. 
</P>
<P>
Inoguchi said Takeshita's resignation and the ensuing confusion in political 
leadership will "slightly weaken the government's position in international 
issues for the time being." But the change may not be that noticeable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bureaucracy has been working on a routine basis," he said. "We don't have 
to worry too much about the repercussions. It's not like the American system, 
where the politicians reign supreme." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling of relief swept the floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders 
said. The market rallied for a gain of 438.86 points on the Nikkei stock index 
to close at 33,244.78. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NTT Among the Gainers 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous among the gainers was Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp., the 
telecommunications giant whose top executives were implicated in the Recruit 
affair. NTT closed at 1.56 million yen ($12,000) a share, a 9% increase in the 
share price. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's announcement was a spark for the rally, said David Wood, an analyst 
for Tokyo Securities Co. "There are obviously lingering doubts," evidenced by a 
thin trading volume Tuesday, "but I think this is a pretty good indication that 
some of the pressure has been relieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers also were heartened by the prospects for the 
resumption of Parliament business. The yen rose in value against the dollar by 
0.21 yen to close at 131.17. 
</P>
<P>
Freed by Takeshita's announcement to proceed with the budget process, ruling 
party leaders threatened to pass the budget in the lower house unilaterally, if 
necessary, before the prime minister leaves Saturday for a nine-day tour of 
nations belonging to the Assn. of Southeast Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Such a unlateral move would ensure final enactment by the end of May. Japan's 
constitution specifies that the budget be enacted if the upper house fails to 
vote within 30 days of approval by the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of an official budget has stalled both public works spending and approval 
of new overseas aid projects. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties, however, warned that the ruling party would face serious 
consequences if it rammed the budget through Parliament, as it did with 
controversial tax reform legislation amid a Christmas Eve filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
"If they cut off deliberations and railroad through the budget, they will face 
the condemnation of the people and have no choice but to dissolve the lower 
house," said Ichiro Watanabe, a lower house member of the moderate Komeito, or 
Clean Government Party. 
</P>
<P>
Osamu Yatabe, a lawmaker who heads the Socialist Party's committee on the 
Recruit affair, said there is no room for compromise on an opposition demand 
for testimony by Nakasone that sparked the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be too late for Nakasone to testify after the budget passes," Yatabe 
said. "If it comes down to the ruling party railroading the budget through, the 
opposition parties are going to have to resort to joint action, and there will 
be political trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Recruit affair first came to public notice last summer in news reports. By 
December, Takeshita's support in opinion polls had started to plummet. But he 
withstood mounting calls from the opposition to resign, largely because both of 
his potential rivals -- Shintaro Abe, the ruling party's secretary general, and 
Kiichi Miyazawa, former finance minister -- also had been tainted in the 
scandal and forced to resign. In an attempt to revive support, Takeshita 
declared that he would carry out reforms to end Japan's "money politics." 
</P>
<P>
But early this month, new revelations showed that the prime minister had 
received far larger benevolence from Recruit than reported earlier. 
</P>
<P>
On April 11, he had delivered in Parliament what he billed as a full 
explanation of his ties with Recruit. He admitted that he and his aides had 
received a total of $1.15 million in political contributions and stock profits 
from Recruit.

A former secretary to Noboru Takeshita killed himself today after the prime 
minister announced he would resign partly because of financial dealings handled 
by the aide, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan Broadcasting Corp. said that Ihei Aoki, 58, committed suicide at his home 
in Tokyo. There was no immediate comment from Takeshita, whom Aoki had served 
as aide for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Aoki had handled political donations, stock purchases and loans from Recruit 
Co., which is at the hub of the influence-buying scandal that toppled 
Takeshita.

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abdul Raouf, 14, has a pen pal in the Soviet Union. He has been there twice, he 
says, on government-sponsored summer camp trips for rest and relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
When Abdul thinks of his future -- he says he wants to be a doctor -- he thinks 
of going to Moscow to study. 
</P>
<P>
His room in a dormitory at the Orphanage of the Homeland here mirrors his 
thinking. On the window ledge are a dozen pamphlets entitled "The Heart of 
Moscow," which extol the virtues of the Soviet capital and its government. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are good; they are the only ones who are helping us," said Abdul, 
whose father, a government doctor, was abducted by Afghan rebels six years ago 
and has not been seen since. "The Americans," the boy continued, "are the 
imperialists who are giving arms to the extremists." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Abdul Raouf and the thousands of other Afghan children the 
government has cared for in 10 years of civil war are living examples of the 
Soviet legacy here, which is likely to affect the social and political scene in 
Afghanistan for decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, which was the Soviets' military headquarters from 1979 until they 
withdrew the last of their troops from the country in February, there is little 
evidence that the Soviets spent almost a decade helping the Afghan government 
try to put down an insurgency by the Islamic guerrilla force known as the 
moujahedeen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brezhnev Bazaar -- once a thriving downtown market where Soviet soldiers 
sold local merchants everything from uniforms to truck parts -- is gone, 
bulldozed to make way for a planned government office complex. 
</P>
<P>
On Chicken Street, lined with shops that catered to the Soviets, the shelves 
are all but empty -- no more Russian caviar, no more crab meat, pickles and 
vodka. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, in Kabul's markets and dwellings, the Afghans, a fiercely 
independent people, can be heard complaining bitterly about the years the 
Soviets spent here. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy the Russians are gone," Sher Mohammed said the other day, 
even though the merchant, who had a shop in the Brezhnev Bazaar, saw his 
profits plummet after the Soviets left. "This is our country, and no amount of 
profit is worth sacrificing our independence," he said. "Allah will provide for 
us now." 
</P>
<P>
A retired police officer, who spent years under the control of Soviet advisers 
and who asked that he not be identified by name, beamed proudly as he recalled 
the time he killed a Soviet soldier. 
</P>
<P>
"The soldier was looting a shop," he said, laughing. "I shouted, 'Halt!' but he 
kept running with his loot. So I emptied my machine gun at him, and he fell 
dead. I felt no guilt. I felt, well, good." 
</P>
<P>
In explaining this sort of attitude, a spokesman for the government of 
President Najibullah, which continues to get enormous military and economic 
support from Moscow, said the Soviet issue is the most sensitive in the country 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very independent people," he said. "We see our culture and our history 
dating back four or five thousand years. Soviet history began when? The 7th 
Century? Of course, we must be grateful to the Soviets for all they have done 
here. Since Mr. Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s, the Soviets have been helping 
us develop our energy, and Afghanistan has cost them dearly in money and in 
lives of their own. But the anger you hear from our people is the voice of 
Afghanistan." 
</P>
<P>
The anger is heard largely from the older generation, men and women who 
remember Kabul as an open, international city before a series of coups and 
countercoups in the late 1970s touched off the war and opened the door to the 
Soviet military presence. 
</P>
<P>
According to independent analysts, the Soviet influence is likely to last 
longest among the children -- "our children of war," an official at the 
orphanage called them. 
</P>
<P>
Another 14-year-old, Kabir Ahmed, has been at the orphanage for two years. Like 
many others at the compound on the outskirts of Kabul, he has not lost his 
parents, but his mother is a peasant and his father is in the army, so the 
state has been caring for him. 
</P>
<P>
Kabir, asked if he would like to study abroad, replied, "Yes, I would like to 
go to the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because the Soviet Union is our friend," he said. "They have done good deeds 
for us in Afghanistan. And the Soviet Union is a good place." 
</P>
<P>
How do you know that? 
</P>
<P>
"Because we have books. We read in our textbooks about the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Do you also read about America? 
</P>
<P>
"America? What is that?" 
</P>
<P>
The orphanage, which is one of the cleanest and most efficiently run 
institutions in this impoverished country, is only part of the story. Of the 
1,500 schoolchildren sent to the Soviet Union each year, only 200 are from the 
Orphanage of the Homeland. The rest are selected from Kabul's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Massoma Esmati, chairman of the All Afghanistan Women's Council, helps in the 
selection. Her group has helped care for hundreds of thousands of widows and 
children affected by the war. 
</P>
<P>
Esmati, who has a master's degree in education from Northwestern University in 
Evanston, Ill., and is one of two women in Najibullah's Cabinet, said in an 
interview that the foreign study program should be regarded as a step toward 
development, not political indoctrination. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan was not something 
admired by all," she said, "but this does not mean that the desire for 
advancement and development has stopped. The Soviets are more advanced 
technologically and educationally than we are. And we share a long border with 
them. They have offered their help, and we have accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"I myself have learned that all encounters in the world between human beings 
have two sides. There are some negative consequences and some positive ones. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," she said, "when I came from my studies in the United States, I 
brought with me some concepts that were useful. I kept them with me and am 
developing them still. But there were certain aspects I did not like, and those 
I left behind when I came home." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the thousands of Afghan children studying in the Soviet 
Union are capable of making the same choice. When they come home, Esmati 
conceded, "I am sure they will bring both the good and the bad."

</P>
<P>
BENTSEN BETS HE HAS MEDICARE NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) knows that statistics are strange and changeable 
things. 
</P>
<P>
When he was writing a law several years ago to provide an insurance fund for 
workers' pensions, government experts told him that an annual premium of 50 
cents per worker would be enough. Let's double it to be sure, Bentsen said, and 
the premium was set at $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the pension insurance system costs $16 a year for each worker, Bentsen 
said the other day, laughing at the memory of how wrong the actuaries can be. 
</P>
<P>
But now this same Lloyd Bentsen is making a big political bet that the experts 
have guessed right in figuring the cost of Medicare's catastrophic-illness 
program, which offers beneficiaries unlimited days of hospital care and 
coverage of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Number crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office told Bentsen that the new 
law will leave a surplus of $9.1 billion by the end of 1993. So he has proposed 
returning $4 billion to Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen wants to cut by at least 16% the special surtax that will be levied on 
the elderly beginning with their 1989 income to help finance the program's 
expansion. The tax, which will be borne by the 40% of Medicare recipients who 
pay federal income taxes, will range up to $800 a year for an individual. 
</P>
<P>
However, other budget analysts have different ideas about how much of a surplus 
the new Medicare surtax will produce. The Bush Administration's experts at the 
Treasury Department reckon that the balance in the catastrophic-illness fund 
will be a much more modest $6 billion by the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
And President Bush, unsure about the impact of Medicare coverage of 
prescription drugs beginning in 1991, fears that even this number may be an 
overestimate. So he strongly opposes any reduction in the controversial surtax. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new program, and we don't have a model to follow," an Administration 
official said Tuesday. "We are facing the unknown in making predictions on 
expenditures and revenues. We want to make sure there is a reasonable amount in 
the fund to cover the costs." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their sophisticated computer models, both sides ultimately are 
operating on guesswork. The catastrophic-illness benefit began Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But the special surtax will not begin to be collected until early next year, 
when Medicare beneficiaries pay federal taxes on their 1989 income. Although 
the government calls the levy a supplemental premium, it is really a surtax 
because it is charged at the rate of $22.50 for every $150 owed in federal 
taxes, up to a maximum of $800. 
</P>
<P>
In determining whether the surtax will raise enough money to cover the new 
program's costs, the easy part is estimating the revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Using data from the Internal Revenue Service and the Census Bureau, the experts 
determine how much money will be paid in federal taxes on 1989 income. Then 
they estimate how much of that will be paid by Medicare beneficiaries -- the 
roughly 30 million Americans who are 65 or older and the 3 million who are 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
But, even on the revenue side of the equation, Bentsen and Bush diverge. 
Bentsen's experts, modifying some of their technical estimating techniques, 
have become more optimistic than they were a year ago about the number of 
well-to-do elderly people who will have to pay 1989 income taxes -- and will 
therefore have to pay the surtax. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's experts at the Treasury Department, by contrast, have not changed their 
view of the number who will pay. 
</P>
<P>
It is on the cost side of the equation that the estimates are particularly 
dicey, however. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital care is the easy part. Before the new plan took effect, Medicare 
already covered all hospital expenses from the second to the 60th day, with 
beneficiaries paying part of the cost after that. Under the new program, 
Medicare will pick up all hospital bills after the first day. But relatively 
few people are hospitalized for more than 60 days a year, and their number is 
fairly predictable from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
The wild card is prescription drug coverage. No one knows for sure how much 
demand for drugs will increase after Medicare coverage begins in 1991.

MADE MONEY FROM BOOK, GINGRICH SAYS

House Speaker Jim Wright's chief accuser, Assistant Minority Leader Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.), said Tuesday that he and his wife, Marianne, together earned 
more than $35,000 by co-authoring a book in 1984 and then soliciting more than 
$100,000 from 21 prominent Republicans to help promote it. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich acknowledged that soliciting money to promote the book was highly 
unusual but he denied that it violated House rules in any way. He also insisted 
that there can be no comparison between this arrangement and the scheme used to 
market Wright's book, which has been criticized by the House Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between doing it correctly and doing it in a way that's 
not correct," he said. " . . . We went overboard to make sure that we followed 
every rule." 
</P>
<P>
The couple discussed the book at an emotional news conference called to answer 
ethics allegations filed against them by Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), who 
contends that there is a similarity between the two book deals. When reporters 
pressed them about the alleged comparison with Wright, Gingrich's wife ran from 
the room in tears. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who authored a 117-page book of personal essays entitled "Reflections 
of a Public Man," has been accused by Gingrich and the Ethics Committee of 
selling the book in bulk to special interest groups to evade the House-imposed 
limit on outside earned income. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who co-authored "Window of Opportunity" with his wife, is accused by 
Alexander of evading the limit on outside income by soliciting money from 
investors who, like some of those who purchased Wright's book, had direct 
interest in legislation. The Ethics Committee has not yet reviewed the charges 
against Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prominent Republicans 
</P>
<P>
The list of Gingrich's investors, which he made public for the first time 
Tuesday, included prominent Republicans such as Joseph Coors and Howard H. (Bo) 
Calloway, as well as business people in Georgia. Gingrich acknowledged that he 
has sought legislative and other government benefits for some of his 
home-district investors, but denied that it had any connection to their 
willingness to kick in $5,000 to help promote his book. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said that the partnership, which was organized by his wife to promote 
the book, was created in a vain attempt to turn the volume into a best-seller. 
Although the investors never realized a cent, they were able to write off the 
loss on their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
He described the scheme as "new and different, but honest." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the partnership's expenditure of $51,571 to advertise and promote the 
book from 1984 through 1986, the publisher reported a net loss of $6,259. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents released by Gingrich, he and his wife each got a $5,000 
advance for the book, they each received $7,018 in royalties, Mrs. Gingrich got 
$10,000 for her work in establishing the partnership and she also received 
$1,500 for work she has done for the partnership since it was created. The 
partnership also reimbursed Gingrich for his travel expenses in promoting the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said that the partnership was a legitimate business deal -- not a 
clever way to collect personal contributions from people with interest in 
legislation. Unlike Wright's book, he noted, his was published by a mainline 
publishing firm and under a routine royalty agreement. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife each received 3% royalties on paperback sales from St. Martin's 
Press; Wright's royalty agreement with his publisher and friend, William Carlos 
Moore, was for 55%.

CHENEY PROPOSALS A BLOW TO FT. WORTH CONTRACTORS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE CUTS HIT WRIGHT'S DISTRICT HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While the effects of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's scaled-down defense budget 
would be felt by defense contractors nationwide, some of the hardest hits would 
fall on the district of embattled House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), long the 
most powerful proponent of that region's defense businesses. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Cheney confirmed the worst fears of workers for some of the 
Dallas-Ft. Worth area's major defense contractors, announcing that he has 
proposed canceling a futuristic Marine Corps aircraft called the V-22, 
discontinuing an Army helicopter program named AHIP and delayed production of 
the Air Force's stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed reductions would help Congress and the Administration close the 
federal budget deficit. But the cutbacks also could mean the loss of as many as 
10,000 jobs at Ft. Worth's Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. and at LTV Aerospace 
&amp; Defense Co. in Grand Prairie, just outside Wright's district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbying Effort 
</P>
<P>
In past years, such recommendations would bring appeals from the district and 
the prospect of a lobbying effort by Wright and other influential Texas 
delegation members to get the funding restored. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, as Wright battles to retain his speakership in the face of 
ethics charges, industry and congressional sources say that he may not be able 
to mount a strong campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"He may not have time now (to fight to overturn the decisions), because he's 
trying to save his own bacon," said Bennie Walters, a representative of the Ft. 
Worth chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look to Others 
</P>
<P>
Walters, whose union represents some of the production workers affected by the 
cutbacks, said that union workers probably will pin their hopes on other Texas 
Democratic lawmakers such as Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and Reps. Marvin Leath and 
Charles Wilson, the latter two members of the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Added one Democratic congressional aide: "Sure, there are a lot of jobs in his 
district (to worry about), but there's only one job that really matters to 
Wright this year." 
</P>
<P>
Wright could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of Cheney's proposed defense cuts, lawmakers who represent 
hard-hit Long Island, N.Y., already had directed their attention by Tuesday to 
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) in an effort to 
overturn Cheney's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Washington-based defense budget analyst Gordon Adams, noting that terminations 
of the V-22 and AHIP programs pose "a double-barreled problem for Wright and 
the Texas delegation," predicted that Cheney's V-22 proposal would touch off 
"the second battle of the Alamo." 
</P>
<P>
While the Speaker regularly has sent Aspin his own list of home-district 
priorities, he has maintained an unusual silence about the matter in the week 
since the cuts were first rumored. 
</P>
<P>
Wright has had clashes with Cheney in the past. Cheney previously served as the 
House Republican whip, and after one bitter partisan budget battle in October, 
1987, the mild-mannered Wyoming lawmaker angrily referred to Wright as "a 
heavy-handed s.o.b." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, however, insisted that considerations of military need and cost 
reduction guided his cuts. The termination of the V-22 and the AHIP alone is 
projected to save taxpayers more than $10 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how we shoehorn it in," said Cheney, who added that older 
helicopters could do the job almost as well. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Cheney left Wright one potential opening. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had money to put back into the budget -- if somebody came along and said, 
'Here's $2 billion a year . . . how do you want to spend it?' the V-22 would be 
right at the top of the list of priorities," Cheney said.

FATHER IN PRISON FOR POISONINGS IS FREED

A circuit judge Tuesday overturned the murder conviction of a man who spent 21 
years in a Florida prison in the poisoning deaths of his seven children in 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Circuit Judge Clifton Kelly ordered James Richardson, 53, immediately 
released to the custody of defense attorney Ellis Rubin of Miami following an 
extraordinary appeal in which both Rubin and special prosecutor Janet Reno 
argued that Richardson had been railroaded. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson could be tried again for first-degree murder, but Reno said the 
state planned to drop the charges within about 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
A white jury in 1968 convicted Richardson, who is black, of poisoning his 
oldest child, an 8-year-old girl, and he was sentenced to death. The sentence 
was later commuted to life imprisonment. The seven children died after eating 
food laced with parathion, a deadly insecticide that later was banned. 
</P>
<P>
"This court is now convinced that the defendant did not receive a fair trial," 
Kelly told a packed courtroom in the DeSoto County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a definite possibility of a different outcome in the trial of James 
Richardson" if material that should have been available to the defense had been 
provided by the prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, a former migrant farm worker, was whisked out of the courthouse and 
into a car driven by a sheriff's department employee. "Within my heart, I knew 
that these great men were going to get me out -- they weren't going to let me 
stay in there," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's wife, Annie Mae, cried when she heard the judge's decision. She 
raised her arms to heaven and said, "Thank you! Thank you!" 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Bob Martinez, who had appointed the special prosecutor to review the case, 
said the evidence presented justified Richardson's release. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Richardson has lost too many years of his life in prison, but my hope is 
that this decision will give him an opportunity to rebuild," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly spent the day listening to arguments from three sides: Richardson's 
attorneys, the prosecutor who brought the 1968 case and the special prosecutor. 
He deliberated about 30 minutes before making his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Schaub, the recently retired prosecutor who tried Richardson, denied any 
wrongdoing and described himself as "the last remaining protector of the rights 
of these poor, young, defenseless children." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Mark Lane argued that the state attorney and the DeSoto County 
sheriff at the time of the trial railroaded Richardson by manufacturing and 
encouraging false testimony and by withholding essential evidence from the 
defense. Lane, a Washington, D.C., lawyer and author, first alleged a frame-up 
in his 1971 book, "Arcadia." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors argued during Richardson's trial that he poisoned the children in 
order to collect on a $1,000 insurance policy he allegedly had taken out on 
each of them. 
</P>
<P>
But Reno, the special prosecutor appointed by Martinez, told Kelly that 
Richardson had received only a business card from an agent with whom he had 
discussed insurance coverage, and had not paid any premiums or obtained any 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Lane charged that then-Sheriff Frank Cline was friendly with 
Bessie Reese, the baby-sitter who at first was suspected in the poisonings, and 
that he had lied to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
Reese, now in her late 60s and in a nursing home, has confessed to nurses about 
the 1967 deaths, according to an affidavit from the nurses. Reese has not been 
charged, and prosecutors have said that she has become confused.

BOB ALLEN; BAND SINGER OF '30S AND '40S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert (Bob) Allen, a vocalist with the old Hal Kemp band whose rich, romantic 
voice made him a favored performer of the lazily arranged vocals of the 1930s 
and '40s, died Monday at his home in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
He was 75 and died of cancer. Until his health began to fail he had been living 
in Encino, where he had retired from music but was successful in woodworking. 
</P>
<P>
Allen was the second featured male vocalist in the sweet-sounding Kemp band, 
behind Skinnay Ennis, who also doubled on drums. 
</P>
<P>
Ennis went on to lead his own orchestra on the Bob Hope Pepsodent radio show 
which, sadly for Kemp, was broadcast at the same time as Kemp's Chesterfield 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp was in the process of re-forming his orchestra when he was killed in an 
automobile accident in 1940. Allen and others took over the band briefly, but 
it soon faded from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Allen then took over Vince Patti's band in Cleveland but gradually moved away 
from music and into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and three sons.

CAPTAIN RISKED WORSE OIL SPILL, BY ROCKING TANKER,TAPES SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
Radio messages recorded on the morning the Exxon Valdez hit a reef show that 
the ship's captain spent up to an hour trying to rock the tanker free, which 
could have sunk the ship and spilled more oil, the Coast Guard said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The captain ignored Coast Guard warnings that trying to move the ship could 
have made the nation's worst oil spill almost five times worse, the recordings 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The state also revised the estimate of the oil spilled from the tanker's 
punctured tanks to 11.2 million gallons. Officials said its crews had been busy 
with the cleanup and were slow revising Exxon's original estimate of 10.1 
million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental damage from the oil still is being assessed, but three hatcheries 
in oil-soaked Prince William Sound have begun releasing millions of tiny salmon 
because the annual bloom of plankton, an important food source for the fry, was 
at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon estimates that at least 1 million gallons of oil still is floating on the 
water of the sound and the Gulf of Alaska, and the fry may encounter oil. 
</P>
<P>
The recorded radio messages showed that Coast Guard Cmdr. Steve McCall in 
Valdez warned Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood to take it "slow and easy" in 
trying to get his ship off the reef that ripped his hull on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you don't, you 
know, start doing any ripping," McCall said. "You got a rising tide . . . . I 
wouldn't recommend doing much wiggling." 
</P>
<P>
But Hazelwood already had begun trying to free the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
"A little problem here with the third mate, but we're working our way off the 
reef," Hazelwood said. "We've, ah, the vessel has been holed and we're 
ascertaining right now, we're trying to get her off the reef and we'll get back 
to you as soon as we can." 
</P>
<P>
The third mate was Gregory Cousins, who Exxon says had been given control of 
the ship as it maneuvered through Prince William Sound. Cousins was not 
certified to control the ship in the sound. 
</P>
<P>
The radio tapes were obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request filed 
by the Anchorage Daily News.

Henry G. Parks Jr., who sold real estate, beer, soda pop and even cinder blocks 
before finding fame and fortune in the sausage business, died Monday of 
complications of Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneur, who formed what is considered the first black-owned business 
to raise money by selling stock to the public, was 72. Baltimore-based Parks 
Sausage makes scrapple, sausage and other meat products for sale in stores from 
Massachusetts to Virginia. The company's slogan, "More Parks Sausages, Mom," is 
well-known throughout the East. 
</P>
<P>
Parks founded the company in 1951 in an abandoned dairy in Baltimore. He took 
it public in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"That's so significant," said Raymond V. Haysbert, chairman of Parks Sausage. 
"Public financing of companies is what America is all about. Underlining that 
achievement is that only three or four other black firms have followed Parks 
into public financing since 1969." 
</P>
<P>
Parks Sausage was one of the largest black-owned companies in the nation when 
Parks sold his interest in it in 1977 for $1.58 million. 
</P>
<P>
Parks also served on the Baltimore City Council from 1963 through 1969 and 
pushed bills opening public accommodations to blacks and easing bail 
requirements for people accused of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that I proved that black businessmen not only can be successful but 
that they can be successful on the same terms as anybody else," Parks once 
said.

A chunk of ice the size of a volleyball crashed through the roof of a house 
during a thunderstorm, and a meteorologist said it may have come from an 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Most likely the ice accumulated on the wing of a plane and then fell, crashing 
into the house Monday night, said Ted Buehner of the National Weather Service 
office at Portland International Airport. No one in the home was injured.

WOMEN'S ROLE IN VIETNAM WAR HONORED

In an emotional ceremony Tuesday, speakers praised the "unsung heroines" of the 
Vietnam War, the combat nurses and other female veterans, during a ceremony 
recognizing the recent addition of the women's panel to the still-unfinished 
California Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Sacramento's Capitol Park. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam, (the nurses) were not only responsible for saving lives," 
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) said, "they also 
substituted as mothers, as wives, as sisters and as friends to the soldiers 
wounded and left to their care." 
</P>
<P>
At a reception under cloudy skies, Speier was joined by Vietnam veterans, 
memorial designer Rolf Kriken, sculptor Rodger Brodin and actress Nancy Giles, 
who plays the role of a Vietnam War nurse in the TV series, "China Beach." The 
newly placed panel of the memorial depicts a combat nurse, in recognition of 
women's contributions during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The women's panel was put in place Monday, and the memorial is scheduled to be 
completed by Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
The panel depicts a female nurse standing next to a soldier on a stretcher, 
whose left arm is missing from just above the elbow and who, despite gauze 
covering his head and eyes, is lifting his head toward her. The nurse, with 
knit brow, is looking off to the side, while her left hand hovers over the 
soldier's chest and the right holds a stethoscope. However, on Tuesday, her 
hand held flowers instead, and a U.S. flag and dog tags had been left on the 
soldier's chest. 
</P>
<P>
The California Vietnam Memorial is composed of four free-standing walls 
arranged in an arc around the central sculpture figure of a combat soldier. On 
the outside of the walls, the names of the soldiers killed in the war are 
listed. On the inside are bronze sculptures and reliefs of Vietnam War scenes 
taken directly from photographs. 
</P>
<P>
The women's panel is the only part of the memorial not taken from photographs 
because no photographs of women from the war could be found. Instead, several 
women veterans worked with sculptor Brodin, describing their experiences to 
compose an accurate impression of the Vietnam nurse. 
</P>
<P>
The same women also posed for Brodin. The face on the sculpture is that of 
veteran Rose Sandecky, and the fatigues were copied from those of Linda 
McClenahan, who served in Vietnam from 1969-1970 in the Army's 1st Signal 
Brigade and is now chairwoman of the California Vietnam Veterans Memorial 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have served this country from the American Revolution to the present 
day," McClenahan said Tuesday, "but virtually that service has been forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
She said that although she did not serve as a nurse in Vietnam, she was proud 
of the women's panel in the memorial. She explained that just as the "grunt, 
the combat soldier" has become the symbol for all military men, so the nurse 
has become the symbol for all women who served in Vietnam.

STATE TO OPEN TRADE OFFICE IN HONG KONG 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, in a continuing effort to raise California's business 
profile in the Pacific Rim, announced plans Tuesday for the opening in Hong 
Kong of a second Asian trade and investment office. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said Hong Kong was selected over several other sites because of 
its strategic location "at the crossroads of trade and commerce with ASEAN 
(Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations) countries of Southeast Asia, Taiwan and the 
1.1 billion people of China." 
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is one of the world's premier industrial business centers," he said. 
"When we establish this office early in next year, I am confident that, 
combined with our well-established Tokyo office, California will be able to 
raise its business profile in the Pacific Rim to unprecedented heights." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco threatened last week 
to strip money for Deukmejian's trade offices from the budget as a means of 
forcing the Republican governor to either approve a tax increase or to be more 
flexible on other contested budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian chose to make the announcement before about 200 business leaders 
attending the annual meeting of the Council for International Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, he said he believed that the transition of power in Hong Kong in 
1997 would have no bearing on the operation of the California trade office. At 
the end of this century, Hong Kong, a British colony, reverts to Chinese 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally we're all going to have to wait and see how that unfolds, but from 
every indication, there is more and more activity these days in Hong Kong," he 
said. "There is an expansion of commercial ties in that area of the world, and 
I think that many countries have concluded it will be an excellent entree into 
China." 
</P>
<P>
In a relaxed and jovial mood, Deukmejian peppered his speech with light asides, 
as he jested about his plans to leave office at the end of this term. Referring 
to the tendency of former officeholders to join the paid lecture circuit and 
write books, he told his audience in mock seriousness that this may be one of 
their last opportunities to listen to a Deukmejian speech "for free." 
</P>
<P>
"And you don't even have to buy a book," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
However, the governor intends to collect a $1,000 honorarium for a speech 
Thursday night at Claremont College, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian used the San Francisco speech as an opportunity to tout the efforts 
of his Administration to promote California's trade with foreign nations and to 
lecture on the need for the state to continue to be a player in the 
international market. 
</P>
<P>
"For a growing state like ours, trade is no longer a luxury but a necessity," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the four other trade offices that have been established during his term, 
Deukmejian said the new trade office would promote California products and 
respond to inquiries from foreign businesses about specific trade 
opportunities. In addition to a trade office in Tokyo, the state has offices in 
London and Mexico City and has one planned for Frankfurt, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Robinson, the governor's special assistant for trade, estimated that it 
would cost about $200,000 for the first year to open and staff the new office. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's announcement followed by one day a move by three Democratic 
leaders -- U. S. Sen. Alan Cranston, Rep. Mel Levine of Santa Monica and Lt. 
Gov. Leo McCarthy -- to create a task force to make proposals for strengthening 
California's trade ties with the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said that while he welcomed any effort to promote trade, he was 
puzzled by the plans for more studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sort of already gone beyond the study stage, and we are now 
implementing the results of the findings that we have made in the past," he 
said. "We're already into this whole effort 100%."

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CITIES BALK AT ACCEPTING STATE PAROLE OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The search for a site in the western San Gabriel Valley for a state parole 
office reminds some people of the barge filled with trash that was at sea for 
weeks because no city would let it dock. 
</P>
<P>
State parole offices are so unpopular in the western San Gabriel Valley that 
the cities of Alhambra and Monterey Park are going to pay up to $100,000 each 
to get rid of one. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a replacement site in Pasadena was so unsettling to some 
residents that 4,324 of them signed petitions to keep an office out of their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt, said one state parole official, that it has become very 
difficult to find a suitable location in the area that will not generate 
opposition since the state agreed to close an office on the Alhambra-Monterey 
Park border. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sort of on the run," said Robert B. Pomerenke, deputy regional parole 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Edward Veit, the Department of Corrections deputy director in 
charge of parole and community services, said he is hopeful that the state will 
find a suitable office in the Pasadena area soon. "The city is working with 
us," Veit said. "We're looking at several sites." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agree on Costs 
</P>
<P>
The state has promised to close the Alhambra-Monterey Park office by October, 
and those two cities have agreed to help pay the costs of moving to the 
Pasadena area. Parole officials said Monterey Park and Alhambra will pay about 
$100,000 each for relocation benefits and to pay off the lease. That amount 
could be reduced if the vacated building is rented to a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
But before the site is closed, the Department of Corrections must find a new 
location. The site that was first selected by the department is in the Hastings 
Ranch area of Pasadena, but homeowners have organized a campaign to block that 
proposal, contending that an influx of felons would endanger their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Pomerenke said the suggestion that parolees are likely to commit crimes while 
they are on their way to or from parole offices is unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"Parolees will tell you, 'We're crooks, but we're not stupid,' " he said. " 
'We're not going to screw up around the parole office where parole agents are 
going in and out constantly. That's a ticket back to prison.' 
</P>
<P>
"A person is probably safer having a parole office next door in terms of safety 
from parolees than living far away." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Persuasion Difficult 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jerome DiMaggio, regional administrator who oversees parole 
offices throughout Los Angeles County, conceded that persuading people that 
parole offices are good neighbors is difficult. "We're convinced that parole 
offices are pretty quiet places," DiMaggio said, "but it's hard to convince 
other people of that." 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said the state has operated a parole office not far from Alhambra High 
School for 10 years without complaint; while an office on Garvey Avenue at the 
Alhambra-Monterey Park border was added last year to handle a growing parolee 
population. Together, the offices supervise 2,000 parolees. 
</P>
<P>
Pomerenke said parole officials became aware of neighborhood concern about the 
Garvey Avenue office last summer after a woman was beaten and robbed in her 
back yard and relatives blamed the attack on the presence of the parole office. 
Parole agents checked the description of the attackers against parolees, but 
found no match, he said . 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a community campaign to close the office got under way and before 
long the parole office was being depicted as the law enforcement equivalent of 
a toxic waste pit. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio, who lives in Alhambra, said the community opposition was 
overwhelming. Even priests, who might be expected to show some compassion, came 
forward at community meetings to denounce the parole office for bringing 
unkempt people to the neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hits a Low Point 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said the low point was reached when the PTA at Monterey Highlands 
School "decided they would have kids draw pictures of people being strangled 
and stuff, with little notations saying, 'Don't let this happen to me,' and 
mailed the whole package off to the governor." 
</P>
<P>
William Carroll, principal of Monterey Highlands School, said the PTA organized 
the letter campaign to the governor, but did not control what the children 
wrote or drew. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said he shared the concern of parents and residents about a parole 
office in the middle of a residential neighborhood and only two blocks from his 
school. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, he appreciates the state's difficulty in finding a 
suitable site. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the fact that the school has experienced no problems with parolees 
since the office opened may be due to increased patrolling by police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Friction 
</P>
<P>
But the patrols have been a source of friction between police and the parole 
office. According to DiMaggio, Monterey Park and Alhambra police have acted 
unprofessionally, stationing their patrol cars across from the parole office 
and harassing parolees. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra City Manager Kevin Murphy defended the increasing patrols as necessary 
to control crime and reassure residents. Both the Alhambra and Monterey Park 
police departments reported last year that crime increased after the parole 
office opened, but neither agency will comment now on the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the cities agreed to stop talking publicly about crime around the 
parole office after the state promised to close it. "We have kind of a pact 
with Monterey Park that we are not going to say any more," Murphy said. "We're 
not going to make any comments to inflame the controversy up north." 
</P>
<P>
"Up north" is Pasadena, where residents collected more than 4,300 signatures in 
a week to keep the parole office out of their neighborhood after they 
discovered that the closure of the Alhambra office would be followed by the 
opening of an office in the Hastings Ranch area. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Ziol, one of the leaders of the Hastings Ranch opposition, said that since 
Alhambra and Monterey Park forced the parole office out of their community, she 
does not want it in Hastings Ranch either. Who would want to force the parole 
office out, "if crime had not become a real problem?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incorrect Image 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said such problems stem from the public's incorrect image of a large 
number of parolees visiting a parole office every day. There is some truth to 
that in urban offices, where many parolees are homeless and come in regularly, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But at outlying offices in areas such as Pasadena and Alhambra, parole agents 
spend most of their time in the field, seeing parolees at home or work, he 
said. Parolees may go to the offices occasionally for drug testing, social 
services or some other reason, but the number of parolees using the office on a 
typical day would be no more than 25, he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Britton, president of the Lower Hastings Ranch Homeowners Assn., said he 
doubts the number would be as low as 25. But, in any event, he does not want 
the state bringing felons into his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Although about 700 of the 900 parolees who would be served by the Pasadena 
office live in Pasadena, Britton said very few of them are from Hastings Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Britton said he is also concerned because the parole population is expanding 
rapidly, and the number of parolees being supervised by the local office could 
increase dramatically in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Grow 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of people sent to prison in the last decade is being 
reflected in the number of people being released on parole. Statewide, there 
were fewer than 20,000 people on parole from state prison at the end of 1983, 
but that number has now reached 52,000, and is expected to climb to 75,000 by 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The state is planning to open 15 to 20 new parole offices statewide in the next 
year, and eight of them will be in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Veit said the state has rarely encountered opposition to parole offices 
elsewhere in the state. The East San Gabriel Valley, for instance, is served by 
parole offices in West Covina that have drawn no complaints, said West Covina 
Police Chief Craig Meacham. 
</P>
<P>
Veit said one exception to the acceptance of parole operations occurred in El 
Cajon in San Diego County, where residents and the City Council fought the 
location of an office for three years, claiming that the safety of children 
attending nearby schools would be endangered. Last year, the state overrode the 
objections, told the city it had no legal right to block the parole office and 
moved parole agents in. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon City Manager Bob Acker said the office has been open a year now, 
without creating problems. There is no evidence that felons have committed 
crimes in the neighborhood before or after their parole office visits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Isn't That Bad' 
</P>
<P>
"Having the parole office in town isn't that bad," Acker said, noting that the 
parole agents stationed there actually are an asset to local law enforcement. 
"The downside," he said "is that within the general community, we have a group 
of parolees coming in." 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said several buildings are under consideration for the Pasadena 
office, in addition to the Rosemead Boulevard site. They include a 10-story 
office building near the Foothill Freeway, a former supermarket in Altadena and 
a commercial building at Lake Avenue and Union Street. DiMaggio said the latter 
building, however, is probably too small and lacks adequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
The state needs an office with 9,000 to 12,000 square feet, ample parking, and 
access to public transportation. Pasadena city officials said they were told by 
parole officials that the office should not be placed too close to police and 
court buildings because that would make parolees nervous. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said some parolees might be reluctant to visit a parole office near a 
police station, but that is not a major concern in picking a site. 
</P>
<P>
The state will continue to study the sites proposed in Pasadena and meet with 
city officials before arriving at a decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Montoya Bill 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who introduced a bill to 
restrict the location of parole offices after residents in Alhambra and 
Monterey Park complained about the Garvey Avenue site, has begun modifying his 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the bill would have prohibited the placement of a parole office 
within three miles of a school or park unless the city or county government 
gives its approval. But parole officials complained that almost all of their 
offices are within three miles of a school or park. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gomez, a senior consultant to Montoya, said the bill is being rewritten 
to require the Department of Corrections to develop formal guidelines for the 
location of probation offices and to prohibit their placement within 500 yards 
of a school, park or school bus stop unless they are separated by a freeway or 
some other barrier.

TOUGHER MONITORING VOWED AS NEW POLICE PANEL IS ESTABLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pledging a stronger and more independent monitoring of police misconduct, the 
San Diego city manager's office announced Tuesday the creation of the Citizens' 
Review Board on Police Practices. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which will be chaired by longtime civic activist Murray L. Galinson, 
is being established under the guidelines approved by voters in November when 
they passed Proposition G. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-member board replaces the outgoing Civilian Advisory Panel on Police 
Practices, which was created with the police chief's blessing and, during its 
one-year existence, was sharply censured by critics who said it rubber-stamped 
actions by the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Communication 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do everything we can to make sure the public is properly informed 
about our work," Galinson said in explaining that the new board hopes to garner 
the support of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of the problems in the past have been because of a lack of 
communication." 
</P>
<P>
However, the new board, when it becomes active July 1, will be primarily 
different only in that the police chief has been removed from the process of 
selecting its members. 
</P>
<P>
And, like the outgoing board, the panel will be precluded from conducting any 
independent review of police complaints and instead will analyze only how well 
the police police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new board will not release any data or reports on individual 
cases and will not disclose how individual complaints are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
But George Penn, assistant to the city manager, said eliminating the police 
chief's involvement in itself makes the board stronger than its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rules to Be Announced 
</P>
<P>
"That was the main issue with the people," he said. "The people said, 'You 
can't have the fox guarding the chicken house,' and that's what Proposition G 
cleared up. These are independent people the city manager has appointed." 
</P>
<P>
Penn also said that new rules and regulations governing the board's functions 
will be announced soon. They will show even more autonomy for the board, such 
as the panel's authority to "look at" but not impose discipline for errant 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Galinson said the board hopes to hold open forums to share some of the panel's 
work with the public, as well as to receive suggestions on how it could be 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lack of public confidence that led to the downfall of the outgoing 
board. In November, two separate review board proposals were presented to 
voters: the Proposition G board and a second, tougher panel under Proposition 
F. Both proposals received approval from a majority of voters. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Superior Court judge has since ruled that only the Proposition G 
board should be established, because G received a few more votes than F. 
</P>
<P>
However, Betty Wheeler, legal director of the San Diego chapter of the American 
Civil Liberties Union, said Tuesday that her organization will appeal the 
ruling. She said the ACLU believes both boards should be created. Under 
Proposition F, the board would have subpoena powers, gather evidence and hold 
hearings on individual citizen compliants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not in Conflict' 
</P>
<P>
"The two proposals, which both passed, are not in conflict," she said. "Both 
can be implemented, and therefore both should be implemented." 
</P>
<P>
Galinson, asked if his review board under Proposition G could work alongside a 
stronger review board under Proposition F, said: 
</P>
<P>
"If there were two, it could cause a lot of duplication in time and effort. 
But, if that was the final determination, I certainly would have no problems 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Wes Pratt, who strongly supported Proposition F over G, said he 
hopes Galinson's panel is at least stronger than the outgoing board. 
</P>
<P>
"That previous body confirmed or agreed with the Police Department's position 
on all of the cases it looked at," he said. "And the reality was that the city 
was settling police-brutality cases and police officers were being fired. 
</P>
<P>
"So there's some room for flexibility. It doesn't necessarily have to be a 
carbon copy of the ineffective process we had before." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recent Shootings 
</P>
<P>
Pratt and Wheeler also suggested that the new board immediately review two 
recent police shootings in the 4900 block of Logan Avenue, in which one man was 
shot six times and died and a 14-year-boy was wounded in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are just the kinds of cases the review board should tackle," Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
Galinson made no commitment to have his board study those shootings. But he did 
say "there would be no reason why" the board could not go back and study cases 
after it is impaneled July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The new board includes, among its 20 members, five blacks, four Latinos, one 
Southeast Asian and one Filipino. There are six women on the board and one 
member of the San Diego gay and lesbian community. 
</P>

LAWYER ASKS THAT PETTI ALSO BE FREED ON BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for reputed mobster Chris Petti, arraigned last week on 
money-laundering charges, told a federal judge Tuesday that Petti should be 
freed on bail as were prominent businessman Richard T. Silberman and two other 
alleged co-conspirators indicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing before U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, defense lawyer 
Oscar Goodman attacked prosecutors' claims that Petti is a danger to society 
and offered conditions that he said would eliminate any supposed hazards posed 
by his client's release. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman said Petti, 62, would agree to have no telephone in his home and to 
avoid contact with "anyone in the world the prosecution says is off limits." 
</P>
<P>
Petti was arraigned Friday on charges stemming from his alleged role in a 
scheme to launder $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent described as proceeds 
from Colombian cocaine trafficking. An FBI affidavit says Petti acted as the 
middleman in the alleged plot, linking Silberman with the undercover agent and 
offering to bring in "muscle" when one laundering deal went astray. 
</P>
<P>
A U. S. magistrate ordered Petti held without bail after prosecutors presented 
testimony calculated to show that he was plotting the armed robbery of a Las 
Vegas bookmaker known only as "Marty the Jew" when he was arrested on the 
current charges. Prosecutors also say wiretapped conversations show that Petti 
threatened four men who reportedly owed debts to the late Anthony (Tony the 
Ant) Spilotro. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, Goodman presented letters to the court from three of those 
"victims" endorsing Petti's release and denying that he tried to extort money 
from them. The fourth man died several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Irving made no comment and asked few questions from the bench. He said he will 
issue a written ruling today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U. S. District Judge Leland C. Nielsen postponed until Monday a 
hearing on the prosecution's claim that Petti has violated his probation for a 
1984 bookmaking conviction. The government argues that Petti has committed many 
acts for which Nielsen should revoke his probation, which is set to expire May 
2.

WOMAN WHO KILLED CHILD REMAINS FREE; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE SAYS HE HOPES TREATMENT WILL IMPROVE HER MENTAL HEALTH 
</P>

Josephine Mesa, who escaped a prison sentence in 1987 after admitting she beat 
her 23-month-old son to death with the wooden handle of a toilet plunger, was 
allowed Tuesday to remain free on probation despite repeatedly missing 
appointments with her probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Don Martinson in Vista said he was frustrated by Mesa's 
failed appearances. But he said he hoped that when anti-depressant medicine 
that she began taking eight days ago begins to take effect, the 21-year-old 
will have a better track record in meeting with her probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa had missed three of four appointments over the past four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Martinson initially indicated he would put Mesa in jail for 30 days, but he 
then allowed her to go free and ordered her back to his courtroom June 27 for 
an update by her probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office asked that Mesa be ordered to state prison for 
violation of her probation -- the second time in eight months she has been 
ordered to court for possible probation revocation -- and her own probation 
officer recommended that she be sentenced to 30 days in the county jail as 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failed Appearances 
</P>
<P>
Martinson, while saying he was disappointed with Mesa's failed appearances, 
agreed with the woman's therapist that jail time might do more harm than good 
for her, especially given the need for her to be on the medicine and receive 
regular therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have bent over backwards. We've been sympathetic to the tragic proportions 
of her life," Martinson said. " . . . Yet every time we turn around, there's 
another little problem facing us." 
</P>
<P>
Mesa pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter after scavengers in May, 1986, 
found a battered toddler's body in a trash bin behind her Oceanside apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa, 18 at the time, initially denied the baby was hers, then admitted she 
beat him. Through a dramatic videotaped interview while she was under the 
influence of sodium amytal, a truth serum, Mesa told the court at the time that 
she had lived a life filled with rape and abuse at the hands of strangers and 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Martinson rejected prosecutors' demands for an 11-year prison term and released 
Mesa on five years' probation with her promise to divorce her husband at the 
time, attend counseling, get a job and return to school. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa further received the scorn of the court last year when authorities learned 
that she had gotten pregnant -- and hid the fact from her probation officer and 
other authorities. That baby now is in custody of his father.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido man who once was a loan officer for a Vista bank has been 
sentenced to one year in federal prison for embezzling $126,924 from the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Terence B. Peek, 37, worked at Southwest Bank, 410 S. Melrose Drive, Vista, 
before he was charged with embezzling. 
</P>
<P>
Peek has paid back about $70,000 of the $126,924, said Paul M. Weil, an 
attorney and senior vice president for the bank. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving ordered Peek to repay 
$49,835.15 after his release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Peek promised the judge he will make "full restitution." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, John Lanahan, said Peek is working in a 7-Eleven and living with 
his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Irving allowed the former loan officer to remain free until May 22, when he 
will surrender to begin his term.

GREAT AMONG NATIONS FOLLOWER REPORTEDLY ABDUCTED; 
</P>
<P>
KIDNAP OR RESCUE FROM A CULT? POLICE WONDER, AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even as a member of a religious group in Coronado prepares to testify that she 
was kidnaped and falsely imprisoned by her family and deprogrammers, 
authorities are wondering if they have yet another in a string of similar cases 
on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
If so -- and the answer may unfold today -- there is some disagreement among 
them about how to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police say they are investigating the reported kidnaping of Dina 
Geerling, 37, a longtime member of a group called Great Among the Nations who 
was reported abducted Thursday in the parking lot of her San Diego workplace. 
Witnesses told police they saw four men force Geerling into a brown Chevrolet 
sedan that then sped out of a parking lot in the 8300 block of Vickers Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
18th Case in 5 Years 
</P>
<P>
Hers was the 10th abduction -- or rescue, or kidnaping, depending on various 
points of view -- in five years involving members of the group, which, up until 
Thursday, had 17 close-knit members. The group calls itself a fundamental 
Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry, while critics characterize it as 
a cult whose members finance what they say is the lavish life style of the 
group's leader, Benjamin Altschul. 
</P>
<P>
Police Detective David Morris, who investigated three abductions of members 
when the group was in Tierrasanta, said he received a phone call Wednesday from 
"someone who is close" to Geerling's family, reporting that the woman would be 
released today unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said he considers the six days Geerling was held in custody, by unknown 
people at an unknown location, an apparent attempt to deprogram her. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the abductors will be arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and false 
imprisonment or allowed to go free because they rescued her from the group will 
be determined after he talks to Geerling, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
"If she wants to prosecute, I'll arrest the people on the spot," Morris said. 
"I'm treating this like a regular kidnaping. But I need cooperative witnesses. 
If she says she was rescued, and she is thankful, are we going to go to court 
on that? It's not a kidnaping if they are rescuing her. It all depends on what 
she says. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carefully Defined 
</P>
<P>
But both the district attorney's office and the leader of Great Among the 
Nations say they believe a crime was committed, even if Geerling doesn't want 
to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Rempel, a deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the parents, sister 
and two other men on charges of kidnaping and falsely imprisoning group member 
Ginger Brown last year, said the law carefully defines when a person can be 
abducted from others and not face prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The criteria are met, Rempel said, if the person is taken away from a dangerous 
situation and promptly turned over to authorities for his own safety and 
well-being. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the abductors) were truly concerned about her, I'm sure they would have 
delivered her forthwith to the police or the FBI," Rempel said. "We would have 
heard that she was safe with police. But, with this newest case, when you get 
into the fifth or sixth day, you have to wonder if she is being deprogrammed or 
whether they are trying to brainwash her." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Family Member to Us, Too' 
</P>
<P>
Altschul said he was relieved Tuesday with word that Geerling would be released 
unharmed, but distressed that police hadn't pursued the case with greater 
vigor. 
</P>
<P>
"We never kidnaped her into Great Among the Nations. She is a family member to 
us, too," he said. "If Dina decides after this kidnaping to do something 
different with her life, that is her First Amendment right, and I respect that. 
</P>
<P>
"Will she still associate herself with our ministry? I won't know until I ask 
her. But I would be flabbergasted and very shocked if she will not go on doing 
what she did before with us, because she very much liked it." 
</P>
<P>
Rempel, the prosecutor, said he was surprised by Geerling's abduction, 
especially given the district attorney's decision to prosecute Brown's parents, 
sister and two men allegedly involved in her kidnaping and false imprisonment. 
All five face felony criminal charges when their preliminary hearing begins May 
8 in Vista Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said he had no leads on the case until he received a call Wednesday from 
someone "close to the family who said she is OK and that they haven't been 
beating her and that they'll meet with me tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in anybody's mind that she is OK," Morris said, although he 
added that he wasn't allowed to talk to Geerling or any of her relatives. "I 
was told everyone is in seclusion. I don't even know what city they're in."

GET ON WITH THE GUN BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Gov. George Deukmejian asked the state Senate to delay passage of a 
carefully drawn bill outlawing the sale of 55 specified models of semiautomatic 
rifles, shotguns and pistols, he said the request did not signal a retreat from 
his previously expressed willingness to sign a law banning military-style 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is the same," Deukmejian said. "I am prepared to sign a measure 
banning these dangerous weapons, but it must be a well-crafted bill." The 
governor said that while he remained "receptive" to the measure's goals, he 
required more time to "review its provisions." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that this landmark legislation already had cleared the 
Assembly and was just hours from passage by the Senate, the bill's author, 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), agreed to Deukmejian's request. 
</P>
<P>
However, as result of his review, the governor now says he has reservations 
about two of the bill's provisions: One of his objections is to language meant 
to keep gun-makers from selling slightly modified facsimiles of the banned 
weapons. He also is concerned because, under certain circumstances, people who 
fail to register assault weapons purchased before the ban goes into effect 
could be prosecuted for a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these reservations seems insurmountable. After meticulous scrutiny 
by both legislative chambers, the measure's facsimile provision purposefully 
avoids prohibition of any gun with a legitimate sporting purpose. Similarly, 
the registration requirement allows assault-weapon owners 18 months in which to 
comply, and gives judges discretion to impose misdemeanor rather than felony 
penalties on those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
More pointedly, any effort to amend this bill now will force it back into the 
Assembly, which passed it without a single vote to spare. This time around, the 
chances of defeat are at least 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
There is no valid reason to subject this vital, common-sensical law to such a 
risk.

GORBACHEV'S TEETER-TOTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new revolution has the one ingredient 
that no spy thriller can survive without. It crawls with suspense. Four years 
into his revolution, every important issue remains in doubt, while he goes on 
winning some and losing some in a fashion foreign to tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
A few nights ago, an inept contingent of Soviet troops made the sensitive 
nationalities problem explode to new dimensions by spraying some kind of poison 
gas into a crowd of Soviet Georgian demonstrators. The gas seems to have killed 
some of the 19 Georgians who died; others were killed or maimed by soldiers 
hacking away with short-handled spades designed for digging trenches. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the troops fire poison gas, they were refusing yesterday to tell 
medical authorities what kind of gas it was that put perhaps 120 people 
clamoring for Georgian independence into hospitals. Without knowing the 
chemical composition of the gas, doctors were helpless to know what antidotes 
to try. 
</P>
<P>
That is how things stood in Georgia when Soviet officers loaded 31 tanks onto a 
train in Hungary and headed for the Ukraine, away from the East-West border in 
Europe. Gorbachev has said the scene will be repeated until 5,000 tanks and 
50,000 troops have left Eastern Europe as part of an attempt to reduce 
East-West tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Moscow say market shelves are so bare that they are reminiscent of 
the days immediately after World War II when an exhausted Soviet Union was 
still trying to pull itself together. Savings soar because there is so little 
to buy, and growth in the economy, already faltering, slowed even more. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Monday, during a one-day meeting of the Soviet Communist Party's ruling 
Central Committee, the last of the Old Guard resigned -- about one-fourth of 
the committee's 251 members -- clearing the way for Gorbachev to replace them 
with people who think more as he does. They include people like Yevgeny 
Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Gorbachev's 
chief adviser on nuclear arms control, and Valentin Falin, a Party foreign 
affairs expert. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution lurches on, Gorbachev supervising from a seemingly secure perch 
on his geopolitical teeter-totter that bounces around from hope to despair. How 
the suspense will end depends more on the tolerance of Soviet citizens for 
descriptions of rewards without the rewards themselves than on the leadership's 
record of wins and losses. Americans cannot and should not intervene in the 
accepted sense, but they need only look back at the brutality of alternative 
methods of rule to find cause to cheer the revolution on.

POLITICAL DRAMA IN TOKYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's financial markets have reacted with relief to Prime Minister Noburo 
Takeshita's announced resignation. So have members of his ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party, who were starting to get nervous about their own political 
futures after eight months of revelations that the Recruit Co., an information 
and real estate conglomerate, had spent freely and widely to buy influence 
within the government. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita has conceded that he and his aides received at least $1.2 million in 
political contributions and insider-trading stock profits from Recruit. In 
addition, Takeshita belatedly admitted getting a $380,000 loan from the 
conglomerate, a transaction that, while not technically illegal, was certainly 
ethically dubious. By last week, Takeshita's public support, according to one 
poll, had plunged to a subterranean 3.9%. By early this week he was on his way 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita has indicated he will stay as head of a caretaker government until 
his budget passes parliament and his party chooses a new president who will 
then automatically become his successor as prime minister. Finding a successor 
who is both acceptable to the party's jealous factions and free from the odor 
of scandal is no simple thing. The most likely choice at the moment seems to be 
former foreign minister Masayoshi Ito, who is 75, in ill health, and -- so he 
suggests -- not eager to take over. Ito could consent to serve on an interim 
basis until after elections this summer for the Diet's largely ceremonial upper 
house. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Recruit affair, smelly as it is, will probably have little 
lasting impact. The Liberal Democrats have held power since 1955, have survived 
other scandals and can count on a strong party organization and well-practiced 
pork barrel politics to see them through. Helping matters along, of course, is 
that most Japanese continue to identify with the Liberal Democrats generally 
conservative policies. But whether the party's solid grip on power is a healthy 
thing for Japan's democracy remains a disturbing question. Japan enjoys honest 
elections, a free press, a multiparty if largely inept political opposition. It 
also has an entrenched governing party that too often has let itself become 
cozy with some of the less savory elements of big business. Takeshita becomes 
the fourth postwar prime minister forced to quit because of financial scandal. 
As he said in his resignation statement, that kind of thing can foster a 
popular distrust of politics.

L.A. SCHOOLS INTEGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am the lawyer who tried the Los Angeles city schools integration case 
(Crawford vs. Board of Education) on behalf of the minority pupils before Judge 
Alfred Gitelson. 
</P>
<P>
I read with interest your article "Integration Fight -- No Victor Seen" (Part 
I, April 6). I think an evaluation of what happened in the fight to integrate 
the schools of the Los Angeles Unified School District required inclusion of at 
least two facts. 
</P>
<P>
First, the trial judge found, at the close of a lengthy trial, that the school 
district and school officials had segregated the schools of Los Angeles not 
only de facto but de jure. Judge Gitelson made specific findings to this 
effect, e.g., that the district segregated minority pupils by, among other 
things, deliberately drawing boundary lines, constructing new schools, 
establishing attendance areas, promulgating transfer policies, etc., in a 
deliberate and intentional effort to further intensify racial segregation in 
our schools. The California Supreme Court affirmed that finding. 
</P>
<P>
Second, efforts to integrate or at least desegregate our schools failed, in no 
small measure, because public officials did not support the effort. In fact, 
they denounced the Gitelson decision and did everything possible to stir up 
public anger. Members of the school district, former Mayor Sam Yorty, and Gov. 
Ronald Reagan were among the public officials who were most loud in their 
condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
The public, misled by officials over a period of 18 years, has been deluded 
into believing that the Crawford decision pertained exclusively to so-called 
"segregation . . . caused by changing neighborhood growth patterns," as your 
reporter, Carol McGraw, put it. In fact, the trial court found, and the highest 
court of our state confirmed, that school authorities had deliberately and 
intentionally followed practices and policies that intensified and deepened 
segregation in our schools. Los Angeles will have to live with the shame of 
that decision. 
</P>
<P>
The history of school integration since 1952 shows that efforts to successfully 
and peacefully integrate or desegregate schools in various communities across 
the country fail unless such efforts have the full-hearted support of school 
authorities and other public officials. Needless to say that support was 
lacking in Los Angeles. This is one of the lessons to be drawn from the history 
of the Crawford case.

MUSEUM FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 12 we were among those evacuated from the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art when a fire broke out there. We want to commend the work of the firemen who 
responded to this emergency. We especially want to commend the two men 
stationed at a nearby building who were first at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
They responded immediately, and without protective fire gear used their skills 
and courage to put out the immediate threat, which could have become an 
all-engulfing fire. They enabled the Fire Department to work diligently to 
prevent serious damage to invaluable works of art.

CLAUSE 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the erosion of civil liberties in Great Britain was timely and 
to the point (Part I, April 6). However, it contained one omission: It made no 
mention whatever of Clause 28, passed by Parliament last year. 
</P>
<P>
Clause 28 forbids any use of government funds for purposes alleged to "promote 
homosexuality." While the details of its enforcement have not fully evolved, 
the law has the potential -- and in fact has already begun -- to have a 
chilling effect on everything from libraries to AIDS education. Broadly 
interpreted, Clause 28 could be held to forbid public libraries to stock the 
works of Oscar Wilde, Noel Coward, T.E. Lawrence, etc. It amounts to a 
declaration by the British government that an entire class of people -- gay men 
and lesbians -- are unworthy of the right of free speech.

HOMEOWNERS ORDERED TO PAY STIFF SANCTIONS TO DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has ordered a Thousand Oaks homeowner group to reimburse 
developers of a huge housing project for about $735,000 in legal fees and other 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian Jr. ordered the Westlake North Property 
Assn. earlier this month to pay the sanctions -- believed to be among the 
heaviest ever imposed on a homeowner group. 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian's order follows his dismissal in February of a lawsuit filed by the 
association against the city of Thousand Oaks and two developers of the 
2,257-unit Lang Ranch project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Fees 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include about $130,000 in legal fees and additional financing 
costs that Lang Ranch Co. and the Anden Group say they incurred because of the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he imposed the sanctions because the homeowners should have 
voiced their objections to the project at public hearings in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The group of 500 Westlake North homeowners will appeal Tevrizian's order to the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, said Teresa Hooks, the association's 
attorney. A hearing date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office will file a brief supporting the homeowners 
because it is concerned that the sanctions will discourage residents from 
challenging other developments, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Antonette Cordero. She 
said the sanctions are among the heaviest imposed on a homeowner group and have 
generated concern in other groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Development 
</P>
<P>
"It throws cold water on homeowners' attempts to use legal means to fight 
development," said Gerald Silver of Encino, director of the Alliance to Control 
Development in California, a coalition of about 1,200 homeowners associations. 
"We plan to help them raise money for legal costs to fight this." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners said in their lawsuit that the city violated a 1980 
growth-control ordinance by approving the Lang Ranch development east of the 
Moorpark Freeway between Avenida de los Arboles and Sunset Hills Boulevard. The 
ordinance limits new housing construction to 500 units a year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the project in September over the protests of the 
homeowners, who said the project would create traffic and air-quality problems. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they had no choice but to approve the development under the 
terms of a settlement the city negotiated with the property owner in 1986. That 
settlement ended a suit filed in U.S. District Court by Lang Ranch Co., which 
claimed that the City Council agreed in 1971 to exempt the property from any 
growth-control law. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners' suit said the city and the project's developers improperly 
agreed to the settlement without consulting the public. The suit sought to have 
the city reassess the project's environmental impact.

SUPERVISORS EXPLORE FUNDING ALTERNATIVES TO BUILD COURTS, JAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Proposition A and its $1.6 billion for new jails in legal limbo, the San 
Diego County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday began exploring other ways to 
build courts and detention facilities -- and immediately encountered strong 
opposition to one of the most economically promising alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring the gloomy prospect of what one top county administrator termed "life 
without Proposition A," a half-cent sales tax narrowly approved by voters 
countywide last June, the supervisors reviewed a variety of funding options for 
new jails and courts. Among the possibilities were a utility tax, business 
license fees in the unincorporated areas, new sales taxes and a "bed tax," 
under which cities would pay a pro-rated share of jail costs depending on how 
many of their residents are housed in them. Most of the alternatives would 
require special state legislation and voters' approval. 
</P>
<P>
Though intrigued by some of the suggestions, the board voted unanimously to 
postpone action on most of them pending further study. However, the supervisors 
also directed Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey to preliminarily move 
ahead on three options: the jails' "bed tax," business license fee increases 
and the possible formation of a so-called Joint Powers Authority with the city 
of San Diego to share downtown jail and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deferred Action 
</P>
<P>
The board also deferred action on a recommendation by Hickey's office that 
$100,000 be allocated for preliminary design work on a new central pretrial 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Because of jail crowding, most people arrested on misdemeanor charges now are 
immediately released, and many of them fail to appear in court. Although 
correcting that situation is the county's top criminal-justice priority, the 
supervisors said Tuesday that it makes little sense to spend money to design a 
facility before a site is determined and until they review the county's overall 
budget later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Riverside County Superior Court judge threw the county's short- 
and long-term jail-building plans into disarray by declaring Proposition A 
unconstitutional on the grounds that its 50.6% voter approval fell short of the 
two-thirds margin for new taxes mandated by Proposition 13, the landmark 1978 
statewide property tax-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimistic About Tax 
</P>
<P>
Although county leaders profess optimism that the legality of the half-cent 
sales tax will be upheld on appeal -- a process that could last up to two years 
-- they also acknowledge that it would be imprudent to count on that happening. 
Accordingly, they described Tuesday's meeting as the first step toward being 
prepared if their worst fiscal nightmares become reality, forcing them to 
replace the estimated $1.6 billion that Proposition A would generate for new 
jails and courts over its 10-year life. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, the county will have to continue building jails," Supervisor 
Susan Golding said. "It behooves us to move as rapidly as possible . . . so we 
can take additional steps when we find out the result of Proposition A." 
</P>
<P>
One of the major alternatives suggested by county administrators is a utility 
users tax that could be added to consumers' monthly gas and electric bills, as 
well as water, telephone and cable television charges. The surcharge would be 
collected by the utilities and forwarded to the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Utilities Tax Appealing 
</P>
<P>
Needing hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade to meet the 
county's exploding criminal-justice demands, county administrators 
characterized a utilities tax as being one of the most viable options to raise 
such large amounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the broad tax base, the tax can generate a significant amount of 
revenue," Rich Robinson, director of the county's Special Projects Office, said 
in a report to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Under county estimates, a 1% utilities tax would raise $24.5 million annually, 
and a 5% surcharge would generate $122.5 million a year. Statewide, utility 
user tax rates average about 5%, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. official, however, told supervisors Tuesday 
that his company is "not enamored with the idea of being a collection agency 
for the county." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E Fears Being Tarred 
</P>
<P>
"The public's perception would be a higher utility bill," said Art Bishop, a 
senior government affairs representative for SDG&amp;E. "Over time, people 
would not differentiate between what was being collected as a tax and their 
normal utility bill. They'd just think they were paying a higher utility bill . 
. . and blame us." 
</P>
<P>
Describing a utility tax as regressive, Bishop also argued that such a tax 
would be especially painful for low-income consumers -- a point echoed by 
Supervisor Leon Williams. 
</P>
<P>
To authorize the county to place a utility users tax on the ballot, the state 
Legislature would have to pass special legislation. Then, if the tax were to be 
used solely for the construction and operation of jails and courts, it would 
require a two-thirds public vote. If the county planned to use the revenue for 
general governmental purposes, only a simple majority vote would be required. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5% Surcharge Inadequate 
</P>
<P>
Even a 5% utility surcharge would be inadequate to build and operate the 
facilities needed to alleviate the county's longstanding jail crowding problem 
and a badly overextended court system, county officials and others 
acknowledged. As of April 3, the inmate population in county jails totaled 
4,706 -- nearly twice the facilities' official capacity of 2,396. By 1998, 
Hickey's office estimates, the county will have to have more than 8,500 new 
jail beds to keep pace with the growing number of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"If the half-cent sales tax is ultimately declared invalid, the county will be 
put in the position of having to look at probably using a variety of these 
options at the same time," said Mark Nelson, executive director of the San 
Diego Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Concurring, Robinson explained that, should Proposition A's funds not be 
available, the county will have to resort to a "shotgun-type approach" aimed at 
relying upon multiple taxes and other methods to raise about the same amount of 
money. Other than the utilities tax, most of the alternatives being considered 
would generate only a fraction of what Proposition A would have generated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cities Would Share 
</P>
<P>
Under the "bed tax" option, the 18 cities within the county would be asked to 
share the operational costs of jails, based either on population or, more 
precisely, on the number of people arrested within their boundaries who are 
jailed. However, state law now precludes counties from charging cities for 
housing felony arrestees -- a barrier that could dramatically curtail that 
option's economic expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, establishment of business license fees for companies operating in 
the unincorporated areas of the county, which also would require special 
legislation, would raise less than $2 million a year, county officials 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation authorizing a joint-powers agreement between the county and the 
city of San Diego to finance construction and operation of downtown jails and 
courts is already in place. However, that option would raise only about $3.8 
million annually in lease revenue, fines, so-called tax increment funds and 
state or federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Options 
</P>
<P>
The other options being reviewed include: 
</P>
<P>
* A new half-cent countywide sales tax available for general governmental 
purposes, including jails and courts. In contrast to Proposition A, such a tax 
could be in place for longer than 10 years. Another major advantage, county 
officials said, is that, even if the courts scuttle Proposition A, local 
residents already would be accustomed to paying the 7% sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
* A $50 surcharge on the filing fee for civil lawsuits, which could raise about 
$1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
* Legislation specifying that a majority vote is sufficient for special taxes 
"to meet an urgent or emergency situation," such as jail crowding. Critics, 
however, contend that such legislation would seriously undermine Proposition 13 
by eliminating the two-thirds requirement for new special taxes. 
</P>
<P>
* Passage of a statewide sales tax or bond issue for jails and courts.

HALL CLAIMS RECEPTION IS FUND-RAISING PLOY; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIAL DENIES ALLEGATION THAT EVENT FOR BERNARDI MAY VIOLATE MEETING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council candidate Lyle Hall and his campaign manager charged 
Tuesday that a fund-raising reception for incumbent Councilman Ernani Bernardi 
is designed to pressure City Hall lobbyists into donating money to Bernardi's 
runoff campaign. 
</P>
<P>
They said the target of their criticism, a May 3 reception to which only City 
Council members and their top donors have been invited, could violate public 
meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the city attorney's office, however, said such a reception 
would be similar to a fund-raising dinner, and would be legal. 
</P>
<P>
The event at the private Los Angeles Athletic Club is being organized by 
council President John Ferraro, said Bill Gilson, his press deputy. Gilson said 
at least 10 of the 15 council members are expected to attend, and each has been 
asked to bring "people who have given to their campaigns in the past -- call 
them lobbyists or advocates or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign consultant Harvey Englander, who is running Hall's June 6 runoff 
campaign, called the reception a blatant example of hard-core political 
maneuvering, which in the past has not been characteristic of Bernardi's 
campaign approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen as blatant a move as this in a long time. . . . They're 
bringing in the influence brokers to muscle them for contributions to Ernani 
Bernardi's campaign," Englander said. "Even in Sacramento, these are hard to 
come by." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Protect Status Quo' 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that because of its restricted guest list and private location, the 
event was a clear attempt by the council to "protect the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important that the city's business be conducted by the people who 
are elected to represent those districts, not the lobbyists," Hall said. 
"Certainly this has the potential of smacking of elitism and being an attempt 
of the system to perpetuate itself." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he has not yet received an invitation to the reception. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody keeps asking me about an event that's going to take place," Bernardi 
said. "I don't know a thing about it -- details or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro was on vacation and could not be reached for comment, but Gilson said 
lobbyists are aware of Bernardi's reputation as an independent voter on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Buying a Vote' 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them know they are not buying a vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilson said that he did not know which council members would attend and that 
they had not yet furnished him with a list of their guests. Council members 
contacted said they had just received their invitations and had not yet decided 
which donors they would invite. Among those who said they probably would attend 
are San Fernando Valley council members Joy Picus and Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Nelson, Wachs' spokesman, said Hall and Englander are being naive. 
</P>
<P>
"You force a person into a runoff, you're going to get hard-core campaigning," 
Nelson said. "Obviously, the lighter approach didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Hall also claimed that because a majority of the council was expected to 
attend, the event could violate the Brown Act, a state law that governs which 
meetings must be open to the public. Gilson said Ferraro has asked the city 
attorney's office to look into that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Violation 
</P>
<P>
However, Ted Goldstein, spokesman for the city attorney's office, said the 
reception will not violate public meeting laws as long as there is no printed 
agenda and no formal discussion of city matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they're going to be discussing social activities and matters of a 
more casual nature at a reception," Goldstein said. "This does not differ in 
any way from when a council person is having a fund-raising dinner, at which 
there is usually a room filled with City Council advocates and other council 
members who, as a courtesy, attend and wish their colleague well." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that when lobbyists and council members are the prime targets of an 
event, "there's no way that you could ensure that city business wasn't 
discussed, or at least pending business with the city." He said campaign 
fund-raisers typically include a larger and far more diverse crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who has served on the council for 28 years, gained 42% of the vote in 
the April 11 primary, short of the 50% plus one vote required to avoid a 
runoff. Hall finished second with 26%.

NBC WANTS TO MOVE INTO PROPOSED BURBANK HIGH-RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC plans to create a new West Coast headquarters by consolidating many of its 
operations in a high-rise complex proposed for the Burbank Media District. 
</P>
<P>
The network announced Tuesday it has agreed to occupy at least one-eighth of an 
800,000 square-foot, $200-million complex of offices, shops and restaurants to 
be called NBC Plaza. The site is a 4.2-acre triangular parcel bounded by Olive 
Avenue, California Street and the Ventura Freeway just west of NBC's present 
home, network officials said. 
</P>
<P>
NBC said it will form a joint venture with the developer, Cushman Investment 
and Development Corp., which has built or is building several million square 
feet of office space in Burbank, Pasadena and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman originally proposed the Media District complex in August, 1987. But 
concerns of city officials and neighborhood groups over rapid construction in 
the area delayed the project until a specific plan to control district growth 
could be written. The plan -- and the project -- are pending before the 
Planning Board and then would have to be approved by the Burbank City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman had proposed building two office towers, one 23 stories and one 16 
stories. John E. O'Neill, NBC's vice president for real estate, said the joint 
venture will propose two towers no taller than that, but final plans have not 
been completed. Between 1 1/2 and 2 acres will be a landscaped open plaza, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman owns or holds options on the proposed site, which is occupied by two 
motels and smaller buildings along Olive Avenue. The site is buffered from 
residential areas by other commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kosmont, a consultant to the joint venture, said it would take about 60 
days to complete designing the project and have it reviewed by city officials 
and neighborhood organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that Cushman and NBC are in complete agreement on is . . . the 
sensitivity of the community with regard to height, traffic, parking and so 
on," O'Neill said. "This will be neighborhood-friendly. It is not our intent to 
in any way alienate the community." 
</P>
<P>
NBC officials said employees who occupy leased office space in North Hollywood 
and elsewhere in Burbank would move to the new headquarters upon completion. If 
approved on schedule, company officials said, construction could begin in late 
1990 and end about two years later. 
</P>
<P>
The network operates nine production studios and a number of administrative and 
other buildings on the adjacent 48-acre site where it relocated from Hollywood 
in 1952. Those buildings would continue to be used. NBC has 1,600 full-time 
employees in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected Burbank City Councilman Tom Flavin, who as a Planning Board 
member has pushed for development of the Media District specific plan, said he 
had not seen details of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think the Media District plan needs some work," he said. "I would like 
to have all of those matters resolved before we take any major action on 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Flavin said the Media District specific plan as written would allow buildings 
as tall as 22 stories in the south part of the district and 25 stories on 
studio property. He said he would prefer a 15-story height limit. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank City Manager Bud Ovrom said he was "extremely pleased" with NBC's 
commitment to a continued presence in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"As to the specifics of the buildings," he said, "we'll have to work with them 
closely on the details" to respond to neighborhood concerns. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million square feet of office space, including the soon-to-be 
completed 32-story Geiger Building, have been built during the past five years 
in areas next to the proposed project.

FUGITIVE IN 2 MISSOURI SLAYINGS CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fugitive suspected of killing two people two weeks ago in Kansas City has 
been captured in Lancaster, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives from Kansas City, Mo., were en route to Los Angeles to question 
Lucky Vance Stancliff, 40, who was being held at the Antelope Valley sheriff's 
station, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Stancliff was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and car theft by deputies 
and California Highway Patrol officers in Lancaster Monday afternoon after he 
sideswiped several parked cars in a stolen Pontiac Fiero, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers said they did not realize Stancliff was a fugitive until a records 
check showed he was suspected of killing his girlfriend and an elderly neighbor 
in Kansas City. The bodies were discovered April 8. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Stancliff was paroled after serving 19 years in a Missouri state 
prison for a murder committed during a gas station robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The latest slayings, committed less than four months after Stancliff's parole, 
have been the subject of intense media coverage in Missouri, said Jean 
D'Agostino, a Kansas City Police Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City police said they will ask Stancliff to waive extradition, which 
would enable them to return him to Kansas City this week. If Stancliff decides 
to fight extradition, the hearing process could take two months, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Lancaster, sheriff's Sgt. Joseph Dymerskie said the car Stancliff was 
driving at the time of his arrest had been stolen at a Sylmar campground Monday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Stancliff was driving erratically on two flat tires and struck four parked cars 
in an area near the 20th Street West exit of the Antelope Valley Freeway, 
authorities said. He did not resist arrest, Dymerskie said.

YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY IN KIDNAPING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old man pleaded guilty Tuesday to assault with a deadly weapon in 
connection with the abduction of a woman he thought had burglarized his 
sister's Cal State Northridge apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Daniels pleaded guilty to the lesser charge in exchange for 
dismissal of attempted murder and kidnaping charges. Daniels, who was 17 at the 
time of the incident, entered his plea in Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' 19-year-old sister, Christi, and her boyfriend, Kenneth Ceasar, were 
also arrested in the Jan. 5 abduction of Czarian Ramsey, 18. Both pleaded 
guilty to assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Christi Daniels was sentenced Friday to 300 days in County Jail. Ceasar was 
previously sentenced to a year in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Daniels, who was released from custody Tuesday, was ordered to 
return to court June 28 for sentencing. His sentence could range from probation 
to four years in the California Youth Authority, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Christi Daniels had suspected Ramsey of burglarizing her campus apartment. She 
said $17,000 in clothing, jewelry and other items had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, accompanied by her brother and Ceasar, went to Ramsey's Sherman Oaks 
apartment to discuss the burglary. They then took Ramsey to a park-and-ride lot 
in Newhall, where Ceasar held a gun to her head while Daniels continued to 
question her about the burglary, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Ramsey told them she believed that she was about to be shot 
when sheriff's deputies, on routine patrol, pulled up. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey has denied involvement in the burglary, which is still under 
investigation, authorities said.

90 ATTEND 1ST WORKSHOP; 
</P>
<P>
VAN NUYS AIRPORT STUDY BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 90 people turned out Tuesday night at the first public workshop for what 
is expected to be a lengthy study of noise and other problems attributed to Van 
Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the Airtel Plaza Hotel on airport property was held to gather 
suggestions from the public about topics that should be studied. 
</P>
<P>
After breaking into more than a dozen small groups for discussion, participants 
suggested a host of topics, including helicopter and jet noise, flight 
practices and a stricter curfew on night takeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
There were suggestions for a restriction on the conversion of airport land to 
non-aviation uses, a suggestion of a buffer zone of light industry between the 
airport and residential areas, and requests that the study include proposals 
for the future of the 62-acre airport base being abandoned by the Air National 
Guard at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the study asked participants not to debate specific measures but 
to prepare a list of subjects to be considered later. 
</P>
<P>
The $300,000 study, sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration, began in 
December with formation of a 16-member committee of representatives selected by 
the city of Los Angeles and federal elected officials and members of the city 
Board of Airport Commissioners. A 10-member technical committee was named 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop Tuesday night was attended by representatives of Los Angeles City 
Council members Joel Wachs, Joy Picus and Hal Bernson and an aide of Rep. 
Anthony Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), who represents the airport area. Also 
attending were members of the Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners, the 
city Department of Airports, the FAA, the aeronautics division of Caltrans and 
the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council, created by the City Council to 
deal with airport noise and other community complaints. 
</P>
<P>
A similar study at Burbank Airport took two years. 
</P>
<P>
It concluded last year with a recommendation for a $50-million program, 90% to 
be paid by the federal government. The plan envisions demolishing 54 homes in a 
two-block area with the heaviest noise and providing soundproofing insulation 
for thousands of other homes in return for agreements granting the airport the 
right to continue creating noise over the properties. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are being considered by the FAA.

HIS GAME'S GROWING AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
STUNTED FOR A TIME, GEORGE FERNANDEZ'S SOCCER SKILL IS RE-EMERGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lights had just been shut off at the San Diego Sports Arena following the 
Sockers' practice. Cory Fernandez, clutching a can of soda that looked gigantic 
in a 3 1/2-year-old's hands, was less than thrilled. He could have done without 
the sudden darkness. 
</P>
<P>
George Fernandez, the defender with the two-octave smile, "Dad" to Cory and 
"Keoki" to his family in Hawaii, patiently explained to his son that keeping 
the lights on costs money. That was good enough for Cory, who ran off to play. 
</P>
<P>
Cory is one of the responsibilities that have snuck up on Fernandez. Life has 
become complicated, certainly when compared with his childhood. He has to think 
about more than just soccer. More than just himself. 
</P>
<P>
A look back. 
</P>
<P>
Age 5. George Fernandez, born in California but often in Hawaii to visit 
relatives, spent most of his days running through the sugar cane fields with 
his dog, Lani. No worries. 
</P>
<P>
High school. Fernandez's focus was sports: soccer, football, badminton. He was 
a natural. Football was his favorite, though he was only 5-feet-7, 155 pounds 
as a senior. University of the Pacific offered him a football scholarship. He 
declined, deciding he didn't want to get his bell rung, and decided to play 
soccer at Cal State Hayward. No worries. 
</P>
<P>
College. Soccer became his life. School meant very little. Fernandez would skip 
classes and spend hours by himself dribbling and juggling a soccer ball, 
refining his skills. It paid off. He was a two-time All-American and considered 
one of the top college prospects in 1983. He was drafted by the Cleveland Force 
and the Chicago Sting. No worries. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the worries began. Fernandez decided to go to the balmy city of 
Cleveland after he took a trip to Chicago and nearly froze. He had brought only 
T-shirts to wear. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, the city, was great. Fernandez loved it. Cleveland, the team, wasn't 
so great. He played in just six games in two years. He says that set his career 
back several notches. His college coach, Colin Lindores, can only speculate as 
to why Fernandez didn't do better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe their expectations were much higher than he performed," Lindores 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez made $50,000 in each of his two seasons in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was money I didn't earn," Fernandez said. "It was, like, a waste of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
He was released after the 1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
Next stop, Los Angeles. More worries. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez played in 64 games in two seasons with the Lazers. From a soccer 
standpoint, he was happier. But Los Angeles was not his idea of an ideal place 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
During training camp, the players would run on the beach at 7:30 a.m. Under 
normal traffic conditions, Fernandez said, it was a 45-minute drive. But this 
wasn't normal. He had to leave at 4:30 a.m. to get there on time. He hadn't 
seen traffic like that since he was in China with the Junior World Cup Team. 
There, he said, people drove at two or three miles an hour because there were 
so many people walking in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez formed some rather strong opinions about L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you," he says, "the psychologists up there must be making some big 
bucks. I spent more time driving than I did playing. It's the worst place to 
live. It's just mayhem 24 hours around the clock." 
</P>
<P>
OK, George, how do you really feel? 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible," he continues. "I can't see how people can live there." 
</P>
<P>
The fast lifestyle doesn't fit Fernandez's personality. Despite his enthusiasm 
during games, in which he might wave the towel to stir the crowd or jump up on 
the glass to slap hands with fans, Fernandez isn't the rock-and-roll, 
party-all-night type. He would much rather spend a quiet evening at home. 
Socker defender Gus Mokalis, Fernandez's roommate on the road, says sometimes 
they'll sit in the room for hours without talking. 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, Fernandez hasn't changed much since high school, when he would 
sit home a lot and watch sports on television, hardly saying a word. His 
parents used to try to get him out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to feel sorry for him because he wasn't one to go out with his 
friends," said Fernandez's mother, Lynette. "He'd sit with us on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's version? 
</P>
<P>
"I never dated because I was too afraid to ask them if I could go out for a 
date." 
</P>
<P>
He's still not much for a social life. "I've always been a loner," he said. "I 
have a good time by myself, read the newspaper. Nobody yapping in my ear." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is perfect. Reminds Fernandez of Hawaii. And it's here, for the first 
time in his professional career, that Fernandez is pleased with his role on a 
soccer team. He was one of three Sockers who played in all 48 regular season 
games in 1988-89. His teammates respect his ability and, perhaps more 
importantly, his intensity. Fernandez, said teammate Kevin Crow, stays at the 
same level throughout the game, giving the rest of the players a lift. 
Fernandez is also the best defender they have on the penalty-killing unit. 
</P>
<P>
It could be said that Fernandez had had a belly full of professional soccer by 
the time he came to San Diego. He was released by the Lazers, and he had become 
extremely wary of pro soccer in general. He'll never forget when the Lazers let 
two players go on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in this league shocks me," he says. "In this profession, I consider 
your job never safe." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fernandez has found some security. Sockers Coach Ron Newman was impressed 
enough to select Fernandez out of 50 players who tried out for one spot before 
the '87-'88 season. Newman hasn't been disappointed. One gets the feeling 
Fernandez is one of his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an infectious appetite for the game," Newman said. "He enjoys every 
second he's on the field. I'd shudder at the thought of not having him. He'd 
throw himself in front of a freight train if you asked him to. Brave as you can 
be. He's just a lovable character." 
</P>
<P>
And finally satisfied. Nothing sums it up better than the picture on this 
year's Sockers media guide. Fernandez is standing in the middle of his 
teammates, smiling like a butcher's dog. The Sockers MISL championship trophy 
is being held over his head. It's his first championship. What's the man behind 
the smile thinking? 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to win a championship and have a ring and stick it in everybody's 
face that said I couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Got it? George Fernandez may keep to himself a lot. He may appear to be a nice, 
friendly guy who jokes with his teammates, gives his shirt or cap to a homeless 
person or spends time with kids teaching them soccer skills. But deep inside, 
there is an intensity. A desire to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win a championship, and I want to win it every year," he said. "A 
lot of people think I'm too into it. But I know what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
He has the same intensity in all sports, not just soccer. He'll talk of playing 
tennis with his wife, Jennifer. She doesn't hit the ball over the net 
consistently enough for George. It's no challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Take lessons," he'll tell her. "Get better, or I'm not going to play." 
</P>
<P>
He's also a pinball wizard. 
</P>
<P>
"Like a little kid sometimes," Jennifer says. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the intensity is also unselfishness. In high school, Lynette says, George 
would often pass the ball to other players to allow them a chance to score 
goals. Sometimes people would say 'You shouldn't have passed that ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted those kids to be in the limelight," Lynette said. 
</P>
<P>
Just this year, Fernandez has become more secure with what he will do with 
himself after he is out of pro soccer. Teammate Brian Quinn quips: "He's at his 
peak now. He can't go anywhere else except down." 
</P>
<P>
Funny. But there's some truth to that too. Fernandez, 27, is coming off his 
finest season. He was chosen defensive star of the game four times, selected 
the MISL's defensive player of the week earlier this month and was recently 
chosen by his teammates as the Sockers most improved player with forward Paul 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
What's next? 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Fernandez wondered if he would have to flip hamburgers or pump gas 
to provide for his family when he was no longer able to play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't worry him anymore. He's taking classes. Preparing for life after 
soccer. He plans to go into commercial real estate or maybe become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first year that he's really looking ahead," Jennifer says. 
"(Before) he just wanted to play soccer." 
</P>
<P>
So he'll play as long as he can, or as long as he can play the way he wants to 
play. Then he'll move on. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I was scared, nervous," he said. "Now I can deal with it. I have no 
worries."

SCOTT OSTLER: THE SEASON HOCKEY BECAME A BIG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trade Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
That's what the Kings must do if they ever expect to become a respectable 
hockey club, or any other kind of club. Trade him now, before lunch, before it 
dawns on the rest of the league what a fraud he is. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky calls himself a hockey player? How many times during the playoffs 
did he sucker-punch an opponent? Did he even once slash, trip, high-stick or 
cross-check -- i.e: execute the fundamentals? He probably doesn't even jaywalk. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it Gretzky who was supposed to bring this city not only the Stanley Cup, 
but also the Stanley Saucer? 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-million bucks for a guy and all he can do is skate and tap a puck 
around? What a monstrous gyp. Believe me, I know my hockey, and as I was saying 
to a friend of mine at halftime Monday night, Gretzky's got to go. 
</P>
<P>
Wait, wait, what am I doing? Let me calm down here, I'm hyperventilating. I 
guess I got caught up in the excitement of the Kings' playoff run, and I'm 
still trying to deal with the crushing disappointment of the sweep at the hands 
of the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Actually I have to admit that, as a true hockey fan of many, many days, I'm 
proud of the Kings. And Gretzky, even though he is suspect as a player -- his 
face doesn't even look like a map of the America's railroads -- has shown 
potential. He could become a good one. Who knows, maybe even a great one. 
</P>
<P>
It seems crazy now, but when King owner Bruce McNall made the trade for 
Gretzky, there were a lot of knowledgeable hockey people who said McNall was 
making a huge mistake, giving away too much, bankrupting the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
All Gretzky did was jack the Kings up from the 18th-best team in the league to 
fourth best, instantly revitalize the franchise and convert about 100,000 L.A. 
fans to hockey. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce showed a lot of courage making that trade," Jerry Buss said Monday night 
in the Kings' dressing room. "You don't just step up to the line with $15 
million of your own money like that, plus (Gretzky's) additional salary." 
</P>
<P>
Buss, the former King owner, tried hard to make a trade for Gretzky two years 
earlier, at roughly the same price, and Buss and Rogie Vachon almost pulled it 
off. At the last minute, Edmonton owner Peter Pocklington backed off. 
</P>
<P>
When McNall came calling, though, the timing was better, Pocklington was ready 
and was blinded by the cash. 
</P>
<P>
In the dressing room after the Kings knocked Edmonton out of the playoffs, a 
reporter asked McNall, "Does this represent a triumph of money over tradition?" 
</P>
<P>
McNall wasn't offended, because he does not offend easily. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question," McNall said. "It (money) didn't hurt any, did it?" 
</P>
<P>
McNall could have taken offense. After all, he initiated and consummated the 
trade of the century, put his $15-mil-plus on the line, and brought Los Angeles 
a new winner, and now somebody is wondering if he is guilty of crass checkbook 
sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Seems to me that Los Angeles had had just about enough of Kings' tradition. 
</P>
<P>
And what's wrong with using cash, along with cunning and courage, to build a 
better team? Did anybody criticize the Yankees for buying Babe Ruth? Or the 
Dodgers for buying Kirk Gibson? 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to Gretzky, whose performance this season reminds me of 
the time someone asked Yogi Berra if a brilliant rookie had exceeded his 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done more than that," said Yogi. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night Gretzky sat at his locker, his eyes red, and said, "It's been a 
very tough year, emotionally. A lot has happened in my life the last nine 
months." 
</P>
<P>
I asked Gretzky if he feels like an L.A. guy now. 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed it here," he said, "I really like this building (The Great One 
Forum), the atmosphere. People talk about Montreal, Toronto and Edmonton being 
great hockey towns, and they are, but the atmosphere here is as good as 
anywhere. Everybody involved with this team is excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
As for his adjustment to a new city and its culture, that seems to have gone 
well. Gretzky, a longtime Boston Celtics fan, has even come to appreciate the 
Lakers and Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic's been great to me," Gretzky said. "This city, more than any city other 
than New York, can eat you up pretty quick if you forget why you're here. So 
many athletes forget why they're doing all the endorsements or making all the 
appearances, they lose sight of what they're supposed to be doing. Magic is the 
best example I've ever seen of an athlete who knows exactly why he's here. You 
just come and do your job. I admire his ability to focus. We've talked and I've 
learned a lot from him." 
</P>
<P>
I should have known who was behind the Kings' success. Not only should Magic be 
voted MVP of the National Basketball Assn., he should be the National Hockey 
League's MVP, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, meanwhile, need some tuning, they need to make some moves. The Kings 
will probably want to send Lucky Butt, the man named Robert who lowers his 
pants and sits on the ice to bring the team good luck, to New Haven for 
seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
There are rumors that Coach Robbie Ftorek will be bounced. Another rumor is it 
will be only a reassignment, that Ftorek will be asked to step out from behind 
the bench and become the new Lucky Butt. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of cooling off, now that I've cooled off a bit, I'm starting to think 
that maybe the Kings should hang onto Gretzky, give him one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne could use a little help, though, and McNall is a fool if he doesn't go 
out and get this Mario Lemieux fellow.

LAKER RESERVE HAS TROUBLE ADJUSTING TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it all becomes too much and even group therapy cannot completely reduce 
the pressures within, Orlando Woolridge occasionally drives to Santa Monica and 
watches people who have bigger problems, such as finding places to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
One look at the homeless is all Woolridge needs. It provides a dose of reality. 
"I look at those people, without homes, without jobs, and my perspective 
changes," Woolridge said. "I get back to a sense of being humble. Maybe my job 
hasn't gone the way I wanted it to this year. But I have a job, a family, a son 
who loves me, good people around me." 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge, however, stopped short of saying that is all he needs from life. 
</P>
<P>
A successful basketball career still is important to him, and Woolridge's has 
not exactly flourished this season. He has had almost as difficult a time 
adjusting to a reserve role on the Lakers as coping with a life of sobriety 
after undergoing treatment for drug use in February of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At times this season, when Woolridge had been benched by Coach Pat Riley or had 
played only a few, ineffective minutes, he said basketball had been a source of 
inner turmoil and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a barometer of Woolridge's continuing recovery from drug and alcohol 
abuse that he has been strong enough to deal with those disappointments without 
reverting to destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Once upon a time, if I had stuff happen to me like I had now, it'd be easy to 
deal with," Woolridge said. "Something would happen, and I'd go out and get 
drunk and wouldn't have to worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"To go through what I've gone through and to be sitting here today, this is 
nothing. A lot's been thrown at me, and now I'm at the point where it's just, 
'Hey, go ahead. I'm ready for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely what Riley, looking for an edge heading into Thursday night's 
first-round playoff opener against the Portland Trail Blazers, has done. 
</P>
<P>
Evaluating the Lakers' chances of closing out the 1980s with a third 
consecutive National Basketball Assn. championship, Riley said it will not 
happen without a significant contribution off the bench from Woolridge, whose 
first season as a Laker was significant only in its disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't win the championship in '82 without Bob McAdoo," Riley said. "We 
don't win it in '87 or '88 without Mychal Thompson. And we won't win it this 
year without Orlando giving us a good performance. 
</P>
<P>
"He is something we desperately need. He could be the difference. He really 
could. If he can handle the pressure, he can supply us with a lift more than 
anyone on our team. That's what I expect from him, and that's what I hope he 
delivers. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I putting too much pressure on him? Yeah, I guess so. I guess that makes me 
the bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
That could just be another example of Riley's motivational strategy. After all, 
the Lakers won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division title 
without a significant contribution from Woolridge, who averaged 9.7 points and 
3.6 rebounds and was benched for six games. 
</P>
<P>
Or, maybe a strong effort from Woolridge, a prolific scorer with the Chicago 
Bulls only a few seasons ago, really could prove the playoff difference in a 
season in which no NBA team has truly dominated. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, Woolridge says he is strong enough now to handle the challenge. 
He does not necessarily want to be, as Riley prophesied, a playoff hero. Nor 
does he want to be set up as a possible scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge said he just wants to help the Lakers win, and perhaps definitively 
prove to the public that he is free of drugs and the same player who averaged 
more than 20 points for three consecutive seasons with the Bulls and New Jersey 
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
That may be asking a lot, given Woolridge's inconsistent play this season. As 
late as two weeks ago, he was firmly affixed to the Laker bench. But in the 
last six games of the season, Woolridge averaged 12.6 points, prompting a surge 
of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I'm approaching it is, I'm just going to go out there every game and 
do the things they need me to do," Woolridge said. "I'm going to go with the 
style of play that made me a player to begin with. The Lakers got me because 
I'm a scorer. They've wanted rebounding and defense. I concentrated on those, 
but I neglected what I do best, which is scoring." 
</P>
<P>
But, does Woolridge think it fair of Riley to heap so much of the Lakers' 
expectations on him? 
</P>
<P>
"What's fair in life?" Woolridge asked, smiling. "I don't know. I think I'd 
rather be out there with the pressure on me than be sitting on the bench. I'm 
not going to worry about it." It is an attitude Woolridge has cultivated. As 
unrewarding as his first Laker season has been, it pales in comparison to his 
disappointing efforts to stay clean after admitting to drug use as early as 
1981-82, his rookie season in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
On that point, indications are that Woolridge has kicked drugs. He spent 51 
days last spring in the Adult Substance Abuse Program in a Van Nuys hospital 
and attends meetings and group therapy sessions as part of a rigidly prescribed 
after-care program. He also submits to league-imposed urine tests twice weekly. 
If, in his quest for on-court excellence, Riley has been disappointed with 
Woolridge's play, the Laker coach said he is heartened by the progress he has 
seen Woolridge make in his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I understand, after admitting to being an addict, that first year is 
very traumatic," Riley said. "The whole priority is to get healthy. So, he's 
had something that is more important than basketball. I don't blame him. I 
think it should be more important. 
</P>
<P>
"That may have had something to do with (Woolridge's erratic) play this year. 
He has to go through therapy and deal with the pressure (in basketball), too. 
If there was anything he needed taken care of, hell, he could miss a practice 
or something. But he's never missed a practice, never been late for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Woolridge had missed part of a day earlier in the month. But it 
apparently was an excused absence that, as events unfolded, led to a distinct 
change for the better in Woolridge's play. 
</P>
<P>
Upset over his benching, Woolridge apparently received Riley's permission to 
take a later flight home from Oakland on April 9. The next night, the Lakers 
had a home game against the Clippers before leaving early the next morning for 
a game in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
But Woolridge also missed the morning shoot-around and an on-court strategy 
session in late afternoon -- both reportedly with Riley's permission. When 
Woolridge finally arrived at 6 p.m., the reporters were waiting and Riley also 
summoned him to his office for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge says that he knew what people were thinking that night. Because he 
admittedly fooled co-workers and fans into believing he was not using drugs 
last season in New Jersey, when in fact his problem had worsened, Woolridge 
still had not gained back complete trust. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just come back into town, and that was the only time I had to meet 
(with the counselors)," Woolridge said. "Everybody went, 'Uh-oh, he's back on 
drugs.' But that was the only time we had, and I needed to meet with the 
group." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling better after working through his frustrations in therapy, Woolridge 
made what had been a low point a turning point later that night. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' blowout victory over the Clippers, 
the Forum crowd chanted "O! O! O!" an obvious plea for Riley to play Woolridge. 
He played the final eight minutes, and scored eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he is off the bench and back in Riley's substitution pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge still is grateful for the fans' support that night. He said it was 
something he desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
During his benching, Woolridge said, all sorts of thoughts ran through his 
head. He said he had second thoughts about having signed a five-year contract, 
believing he might be stuck on the bench for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough time," he said. "I was at a point where I was trying to do all 
the right things, but it's like I was stuck in a situation where I had no 
control. I was coming to practice early, working probably harder than I ever 
worked. But the results weren't coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to a point where I just wanted to throw my hands up and say, 'What's 
going on here?' People close to me just said, 'Hold on, your break is gonna 
come.' But when? 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible how fast it turned around -- that same night. It's like, you 
can't go any lower than this." 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge admitted that, at times, he wished he had accepted an offer from 
Philadelphia or other interested teams instead of signing with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said that to myself a lot of times," Woolridge said. "I was like, 'Wow, I 
turned down a lot to be here.' Then, I'd look at my situation, and I wasn't 
being patient. I was thinking I'd rot on the bench the rest of my career. 
</P>
<P>
"Things weren't going the way I wanted them to. One part of being mature and 
accepting responsibility is that, once you make a decision, you stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had enough talent that this wouldn't be a permanent thing. Pat and I 
are still trying to get to know each other as player, coach and as people. I 
know I've had trouble adjusting. I tried to force it." 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge's regular-season performance certainly was not what either party 
expected after the Lakers signed him for $3 million over five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
When Woolridge looked strong in training camp, Riley said he saw Woolridge as a 
reincarnation of McAdoo, even though Woolridge scores mainly on drives to the 
basket and does not have McAdoo's outside shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley said he expected the same kind of point production. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got McAdoo in '82, he was points off the bench," Riley said. "He 
averaged 15 points and shot 50%. His defense wasn't that great . . . but what 
he was was so efficient a scorer, night in and night out, that we didn't have 
to worry about that other stuff from him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing with Orlando. When he came here, that's what I expected, 15 
points off the bench. That he hasn't done that consistently waves the red flag 
at his other area (defensive and rebounding deficiencies). 
</P>
<P>
"His performances were so down -- I think for 37 straight games I played him he 
shot 30% -- that I could not continue to play him. He had to take stock of his 
game. He could not take playing every night for granted. And, I think he did 
take it for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Woolridge: "The way I had foreseen the season going just didn't work 
out that way, and I was frustrated. I put too much pressure on myself, tried to 
change my game more than I was physically or mentally able to do. Now, when I 
go out there, I'm just going to let it flow." 
</P>
<P>
At 29, Woolridge says he has not detected many physical shortcomings, even 
though he used cocaine for several years. But he admitted that missing most of 
last season because of injuries and rehabilitation was a setback he still is 
trying to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"You lose that mind-body fluidity," Woolridge said. "It just was not there. I'd 
get the ball, isolated in the corner, and plays that I used to make without 
thinking, I wouldn't do. I'd lose the ball or something. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go on instinct in basketball, and my instinct this year (was 
terrible). I'd hesitate. It's taken me this long to get that rhythm back. What 
you lose is that uninhibited, free-lance, forget-it attitude. You get passive, 
almost. You think, 'I don't want to make a mistake here.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Woolridge said that his tentativeness has lifted in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm back now," he said. "After I made that 360-degree dunk one recent 
game, my wife told me, 'O, you're back.' I hope so. This thing has been a 
growing experience for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to deal with these things outside of basketball with some sanity 
and keep a smile on my face. Sometimes, it was just a mask I've worn." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, no doubt, hope Woolridge will wear a Bob McAdoo mask during the 
playoffs and fulfill Riley's lofty expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to O now," Riley said. "He's got to put the pressure on himself. I 
think he can handle it now."

MORNING BRIEFING: SOMEONE THINKS HE IS LARGER THAN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is 140 feet wide, 90 feet long and lives on the side of a wall? 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The quixotic 18-year-old tennis star is getting his own mural, courtesy of 
Nike, which means that Agassi is following in the paintprints of such Nike 
clients and mural subjects as John McEnroe and Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The mural is being painted on a wall of the Figueroa Hotel on Olympic and 
Figueroa and is scheduled to be completed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi is portrayed hitting a forehand. The background is fluorescent orange. 
Since the mural is so large on the side of the building, Agassi's hair is very 
long. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cutting the mustard: There is a big problem in Cleveland, where the Indians 
have switched the mustard they serve on hot dogs at Municipal Stadium -- Famous 
Bertman Ball Park Mustard -- and replaced it with, yes, Authentic Stadium 
Mustard, because it was cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble, according to the finely tuned tummies of generations of brave 
Indian fans, is that the new mustard doesn't taste very authentic, no matter 
how you spread it. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Snyder, 43, of Columbus, Ohio, was incensed. "It's like taking the brats 
(bratwurst) out of Milwaukee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, however, the hot doggers are simply skipping the mustard, perhaps 
going for the relish instead, since fans have been eating about 1 1/2 hot dogs 
apiece per game, the same as usual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trivia: What has not happened in 605 days? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Read this, feel better: Rodney Peete, you may not be doomed to mediocrity after 
all, even though you didn't get drafted until the sixth round. Three other USC 
quarterbacks before you all got drafted late and went on to become NFL 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the Rams didn't draft Pat Haden until the seventh round. Vince Evans 
went to the Chicago Bears in the sixth round in 1977, and Paul McDonald wasn't 
picked until the fourth round by the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disarming evidence: If Peete's arm is so weak, USC quarterback Coach Chuck 
Stobart wonders why Peete was able to complete so many passes in the "deep out" 
pattern, in which the quarterback throws toward the opposite sidelines. Peete 
had farther to throw it, too, Stobart said. 
</P>
<P>
"The hashmarks in college are a lot closer to the middle of the field than in 
the pros," Stobart said. "We never felt his arm strength was a problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pass the Cup: "In the matter of the America's Cup, America should now be both 
gracious and magnanimous. . . . It is better to race and lose than never more 
to race internationally at all. . . . There will then be an outpouring of 
social and national amenities for the next race. And a noble sport will be 
revivified." 
</P>
<P>
Sound reasonable? It's from the Saturday Evening Post, the edition of Sept. 26, 
1903. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: A trade by the Toronto Blue Jays. General Manager Pat Gillick is 
being called Stand Pat Gillick in the Toronto newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paging Dr. Mike: Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson will receive an honorary 
doctorate in humane letters from Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Central State president Arthur Thomas said the school was honoring Tyson for 
his influence on young people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money matters: Should the Lakers go all the way and win the National Basketball 
Assn. title to complete the trifecta, they would earn $57,416 a player, if 
money from the playoff pool is divided into 12 even shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: As the often wild Chicago Cubs pitcher Mitch Williams walked by the 
office of Manager Don Zimmer, he saw Zimmer rubbing his head and said: "Don't 
worry, Skip. What little hair you got you won't have when I get through with 
you."

NEWSWIRE: JOHNSON SABOTAGE THEORY IS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The theory that Ben Johnson was a victim of sabotage at the Seoul Olympics 
surfaced again at an inquiry into drug use by Canadian athletes on Tuesday at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
David Sookram, attorney for Dr. Jamie Astaphan, who treated Johnson, suggested 
during cross-examination of Waldemar Matuszewski, Johnson's physical therapist, 
that Johnson received pills described as pain killers several days before he 
tested positive for steroids and was stripped of the gold medal he won in the 
100-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the inquiry's senior counsel, Robert Armstrong, had recommended that 
the theory of someone tampering with Johnson's water bottle in Seoul be 
discounted when he told commissioner Charles Dubin that all lawyers involved in 
the probe had agreed to abandon it.

<P>
IT'S LIKE HAVING A PICASSO ON YOUR DESK; 
</P>
<P>
LORD OF THE FLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poul Jorgensen was playing at being a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"People think the Beaverkill is where the fly tyers sit all winter and tie 
flies," he told a Los Angeles audience of fly fishermen recently. "I don't. 
When the leaves are off the trees and all the fishermen are gone, I go out and 
take all the flies they left behind out of the trees and sell them." 
</P>
<P>
Fly anglers know Jorgensen as the creator of some of the most beautiful and 
delicately intricate artificial fly patterns in the world, the maestro of the 
craft. Having a Jorgensen fly, one said, "is like having a Picasso on your 
desk." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have met him know that he also has a wonderful sense of humor, 
flavored with a Danish accent. 
</P>
<P>
"Some writers don't understand me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But when admirers, including some distinguished fly tyers in their own right, 
approach him, humbly requesting that he autograph his fifth and latest book, he 
puts them at ease by saying, "I didn't invent fly tying. I didn't even have an 
accent when I came to this country." 
</P>
<P>
After a life of upheaval, Jorgensen, 63, is comfortably settled in the 
Catskills in Roscoe, N.Y. -- "Trout Town, USA" -- a legend in his time in a 
legendary locale for fly fishing, a place dedicated fly anglers regard with 
reverence. The Winnewemoc, which meets the Beaverkill at Junction Pool, flows 
30 feet from his back door. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Truthfully, Jorgensen has been a survivor. He survived the Nazis in Denmark, 
the fast lane of corporate life in New York, a failed marriage and, finally, 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
None of that is in his new work, "Poul Jorgensen's Book of Fly Tying," (Johnson 
Books, $19.95), save for a single line of dedication: " . . . with gratitude to 
Bill W., to Dr. Bob, and to my sweetheart, Carol. They saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about that, Jorgensen paused, realizing that the giveaway was that only 
first names were used, in the tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
He sighed, then told the story: "Twenty years ago I had a drinking problem, and 
in 1970 I came into Alcoholics Anonymous. When I introduce myself I just say, 
'My name's Poul and I'm a recovering alcoholic. I haven't had a drink today.' " 
</P>
<P>
He goes to meetings three or four times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ashamed of it. I'm proud of it. I'm programmed to drink, but I don't, 
and I don't because of Alcoholics Anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
The drinking coincided with a crisis in Jorgensen's life. He had a good job 
with a Swedish office equipment company as a mechanical engineer. Too good. The 
pressures drove him to drinking, and his wife left, taking their three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"They promoted me to director of technical services with headquarters in New 
York City, and they gave me 50 people (to supervise)," he said. "All the 
electronics started coming out. I had to re-train myself completely, since I 
was mechanical. I could only work with things that moved. After two years 
there, I couldn't stand it anymore. I felt boxed in. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to send me back to Europe, but I said, 'No. I quit.' " 
</P>
<P>
He drifted in misery to Baltimore, where his fly tying skills led to a job as a 
consultant for a tackle company. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, I was tying flies at a banquet in New York City, and three weeks 
later I was at another place in Pennsylvania and this guy came running after me 
. . . said he'd been looking for me all up and down the East Coast. Said he 
wanted me to write a book for them." 
</P>
<P>
That was 1972, the book was published in '73 and, Jorgensen said, "As soon as 
that was out, another publisher asked me to do one for him, and people started 
asking me to come and do their banquets. I was very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
He said he couldn't have done it without Bill W., Dr. Bob and Carol. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been dead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the people he grew up with are. Jorgensen was 14 when German troops 
rolled into his town, Odense, on the Danish island of Funen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was five years of hell," Jorgensen said. "They kept us hostage for five 
years. For the last two years of the war I was part of the Danish Resistance 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"On the fourth of May, 1945, we all helped throw the Germans out. The soldiers 
they had in Denmark at the end of the war were kids 15, 16 years old and old 
men, most of them injured. We came out with machine guns and pointed south. 
They just laid down their weapons and kept walking. The British and Americans 
were coming up from the south. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst of all were the Danish collaborators. They barricaded themselves and 
we had to flush 'em out." 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen said there were trials. For some. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. The ones that survived had trials." 
</P>
<P>
From those grim times, Jorgensen emerged to distinction in his gentle art, and 
when he did he was somewhat caught by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I was doing a demonstration and I finished a salmon fly. The person 
said to me, 'Do you want to sell that?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Yeah.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'How much is it?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh, $25.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I figured if people were willing to pay $25 for a salmon fly, why should I 
sit down and tie a dozen fishing flies for $6.50? 
</P>
<P>
"Now I only tie for collectors. It's an investment. They figure that someday 
I'm going to die. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I tie a better fly than some of the fine amateur tyers we have 
today, but they can't sign Poul Jorgensen's name to it. They're not paying for 
the fly. They're paying for my name. This may sound egotistical, but that's the 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
"No slimy fish are ever gonna get their teeth in these flies because these are, 
unframed, $50 apiece -- unless some person who is a millionaire wished to fish 
with these exclusively." 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen's eyes crinkled behind his cutoff spectacles. 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes I play a little. I have the urge to go down behind the house and 
see if it works. When somebody asks me, 'Did you go fishing yesterday?', I say, 
'No, I just went down and tested a couple of flies.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen's flies start at $50, framed $125. He sold a framed group of 11 flies 
to an Oxnard collector for $2,500. Still, he has trouble keeping up with the 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm about a year behind on delivery right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His new book, he said, "is for somebody who has never heard or seen anything 
about fly tying." 
</P>
<P>
It has already sold 3,000 copies, sending the publisher back to the printer. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an all-round fly tyer but there are certain things I am best known for," 
Jorgensen said. "Salmon flies and some of my realistic patterns." 
</P>
<P>
The dry fly, Jorgensen said, "is considered the purest form, (but) if the 
object was to take as many fish as you could within a certain period of time, 
(using) a nymph I would out-fish a dry-fly fisherman, 10 to one. The fish takes 
about 90% of his food underwater." 
</P>
<P>
But, Jorgensen said with a chuckle, he would never use a nymph, which is meant 
for fishing beneath the surface, because "that's too close to worm-fishing." 
</P>
<P>
The idea, he said, is not necessarily to imitate nature's insects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly making it attractive to the fish." 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen is a strong advocate of the growing catch-and-release philosophy. He 
gives pins to people who fish that way on the Beaverkill. 
</P>
<P>
"Limit your kill," he says, "don't kill your limit." 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen noted a recent trend, that fly fishing is becoming attractive to 
young, upscale people. 
</P>
<P>
"They want the very best equipment," he said. "They don't know how to use it, 
but it has to be the best." 
</P>
<P>
He has created a fly just for them, the yuppie. "And, believe it or not, it 
works," he said.

FISH REPORT: BIG TROUT PLANTED AT IRVINE LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine Lake, known for its stocked rainbow trout in the five- to 10-pound 
class, was planted with fish weighing between 10 and 18 pounds last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of them have been caught yet, several large rainbows were taken 
last weekend. And, a lake spokesman said, it was none other than Jack Fish who 
caught the biggest, an 8 3/4-pound trout.

ANGLERS WILL NEED A LITTLE MORE PATIENCE TO GET THEIR LICENSE TO FISH 
</P>

<P>
Mike Johns, manager of Toms Place store and cafe at Rock Creek north of Bishop, 
advises anglers to buy their 1989 licenses at home before heading to the 
Eastern Sierra for the opening of the trout season Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll save themselves a lot of time and trouble," Johns said. 
</P>
<P>
The new licenses introduced in January are larger and more complicated than the 
old ones -- the price of the California Department of Fish and Game's finally 
entering the age of automation. 
</P>
<P>
The licenses, measuring 5 1/2 inches by eight inches, require name, address, 
description and Social Security and driver's license numbers, with little blank 
boxes for individual letters and numbers. They come in triplicate. The buyer 
gets a copy, one goes to the DFG in Sacramento, and the seller keeps the other. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes about eight minutes to fill out," Johns said. "And you have to fold 
it eight times to get it into your wallet. I'm going to have to hire a girl to 
do nothing but sell fishing licenses this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
In two test purchases by The Times, the entire transactions required six and 
eight minutes, including payment and folding. Some people print faster than 
others. The price remains the same: $19.25 for California residents, plus $3.50 
for a striped bass stamp and $1 for an ocean enhancement stamp to fish south of 
Point Arguello. 
</P>
<P>
The sellers were issued five-page booklets on how to sell the new licenses, and 
they aren't thrilled about serving as file clerks for the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Carmichael, director of the licensing operation in Sacramento, said the 
forms are designed for optical scanning. 
</P>
<P>
"They shouldn't take much longer," she said. "There are only two new pieces of 
information we're requesting. You do have to print in the boxes, and you may 
have to print a little bit slower, but it's basically the same procedure." 
</P>
<P>
The sellers receive 50 cents a license, but Johns isn't sure it's worth the 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The old way, you'd just put a new stamp on it and you're out the door," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The change was made to establish a data base of license buyers, Carmichael 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Fish and Game has never had a record of who our license 
buyers are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The check was in the mail: From Bassin' magazine, sponsor of the Big Bass World 
Championship, comes the hard-luck story of Dan Kadota of La Palma, who missed a 
shot at $46,000 because of the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
Last Jan. 2, Kadota, who runs the charter boat Mustang out of 22nd Street 
Landing in San Pedro, mailed a check for $32.90 and an entry blank for the 
BBWC, which pays $25,000 for the largest bass caught during the year, plus 
$20,000 if the winner is a subscriber to the magazine and $1,000 for the 
largest bass in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Six days later Kadota caught a 19.04-pound largemouth at Lake Castaic. If 
approved by the International Game Fish Assn., it will be a world record for 
20-pound test line -- but it won't win the BBWC. 
</P>
<P>
Bassin' magazine never received his entry and check. Two weeks after he mailed 
it, the Postal Service returned what was left of them with an apology and 
explanation that they had been mangled in a sorting machine. 
</P>
<P>
BBWC rules stipulate that it can't be responsible "for lost, late or 
misdirected mail." 
</P>
<P>
Kadota thinks the fish would have held up through the year because most trophy 
bass are taken in the early months. Otherwise, the current leader is one of 11 
pounds 8 ounces caught in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kadota: "I've released three fish at Castaic this year that were bigger 
than that." 
</P>

Encino lawyer Barry Gold returned from his annual trip to the Florida Keys 
claiming a "grand slam" for reef fishing: a 90-pound tarpon, 25-pound permit 
and four bonefish to 11 pounds. All were released. Of the 2 1/2-foot-long 
permit, taken on light tackle and 12-pound test line, Gold said, "I've battled 
billfish and tuna that didn't pull as hard."

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
LEMIEUX TIES THREE RECORDS IN 10-7 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first four games of their playoff series, the Philadelphia Flyers spent 
much of the time roughing up Mario Lemieux, the star of the Pittsburgh 
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic worked so well, with unexpected help from Lemieux's teammate, Randy 
Cunneyworth, that Lemieux, battered and bruised, was a doubtful starter in Game 
5 Tuesday night at Pittsburgh. His worst injury, caused by his teammate, was a 
neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux, too big, at 6-4 and 200, to be intimidated, was ready for the opening 
faceoff. Ready is an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
He tied a playoff record by scoring four goals in the first period and, in a 
wild scoring game, the Penguins outlasted Philadelphia, 10-7. The win gave the 
Penguins a 3-2 lead in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Showing no sign that he was ailing, Lemieux also matched two other playoff 
records in addition to the four in a period set by Tim Kerr of the Flyers in 
1985. He scored his fifth goal and eighth point when he scored into an empty 
net with 37 seconds left. Maurice Richard (1944), Darryl Sittler (1976) and 
Reggie Leach (1976) had five goals. Last spring, Patrik Sundstrom of New Jersey 
had eight points. 
</P>
<P>
The rough-house tactics had limited Lemieux to three goals in the first four 
games. But in this one, he flexed a few muscles of his own, skating right in on 
goalie Ron Hextall from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Until a couple of hours before game time, Lemieux could not turn his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I had played mediocre hockey and my teammates expect more of me," Lemieux, who 
said treatment took the pain out of his neck. "I had to come out and start 
putting the puck in the net." 
</P>
<P>
That, he did. Lemieux, in one of the great games in Stanley Cup history, had a 
natural (three goals in a row) hat trick in the first 6 minutes 50 seconds. He 
scored on a breakaway at 2:15, from close range at 3:45, and on another 
breakaway at 6:50. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins, who can clinch the series with a victory at Philadelphia Thursday 
night, had a 9-3 lead, but two goals by Kerr helped the Flyers pull to within 
two with almost three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Boston 2 -- One defeat is all the Canadiens were willing to put up 
with in this series. They put Patrick Roy in the nets at Montreal and he was 
too much for the Bruins once again. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, unbeaten at the Forum all season, turned back 22 shots and ran his playoff 
recors to 7-0 and the Canadiens eliminated Boston, 4-1. Last spring the Bruins 
knocked out the Canadiens and reached the Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Chris Chelios had a goal and an assist in the second period to send 
the Canadiens into the lead for good. Bob Joyce scored both Boston goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens are a heavy favorite to face Calgary in the final round. Next 
they face the winner of the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh series. DAN HAFNER

Media Firms: Two media firms, Washington Post Co. and Knight-Ridder Inc. 
reported declines in their first-quarter earnings. The Washington Post Co.'s 
earnings tumbled 71% to $41.5 million. Revenue rose 6.5% to $341.9 million. The 
firm noted that the 1988 results had included a non-recurring gain of $115.7 
million from the sale of cellular telephone interests. Excluding that gain, the 
company said its earnings would have risen 42% from a year earlier. Newspaper 
division revenue climbed 7%, its television station revenue was up 5% and cable 
division revenue gained 13%. Newsweek's revenue rose 1%. Miami-based 
Knight-Ridder said its profit fell 39.3% to $20.5 million from $33.8 million. 
Revenue rose 10.4% to $540.7 million. Robert F. Singleton, senior vice 
president and chief financial officer, said, "This was a difficult quarter."

Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said in a statement that he was optimistic about 
the second quarter since refining margins and foreign natural gas prices had 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil earned $429 million, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter, down from 
$549 million, or $1.33, a year earlier. Revenue increased to $14.0 billion from 
$13.9 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil said exploration and producing results were also down as lower natural 
gas prices more than offset higher crude prices. In addition, 1988 earnings 
benefited from sales of U.S. producing properties.

JACK SMITH: THE HEAVE-HO TO MEATLESS DODGER DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I apologize to vegetarians, but I have given up my decision to join their 
ranks, at least for the duration of the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
I was moved to recant by a story in Steve Harvey's "Only in L.A." column about 
a letter from Harold Fleischman, Encino attorney, to Peter O'Malley, president 
of the Dodgers, urging O'Malley to see that the concessions at Dodger Stadium 
serve low-cholesterol foods (such as meatless hot dogs, salads, yogurt and 
mineral water) as well as the traditional beef hot dogs and beer. 
</P>
<P>
As moved as I am by the arguments of the animal protectionists, who ask us to 
give up meat on health and humane grounds, the prospect of watching a baseball 
game without indulging in a hot dog (with lots of relish and mustard) is too 
depressing to consider. Vegetables and yogurt at a baseball game? It's 
un-American. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I continue to receive passionate arguments from readers on both 
sides of the question. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Stickel of San Diego scorns the animal lovers. "There even are 
nitwits who want to confer constitutional rights on animals now," he says. "I 
just heard an advertisement on the radio for our San Diego Wild Animal Park in 
which the offspring of gorillas were referred to as 'a boy and a girl'! 
</P>
<P>
"In your column today," he goes on, "you wrote of our coming down out of the 
trees. Well, maybe we did come down out of the trees; but if we are not created 
in God's image, how come we are the only creatures to advance to the point 
where we can really take care of ourselves and master our environment?" 
</P>
<P>
Master our environment? We seem to be destroying it. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Nelson of Arcadia tightens the screw by suggesting that plants have 
feelings too. Nelson recalls reading that plants can be conscious, feel and 
express emotion, and suffer pain. She describes an experiment in which a woman 
who had a terrible fear of flying took a favorite plant with her on a plane 
ride from California to Boston. Scientists attached sensitive electrodes to the 
plant. "At the precise moments of its master's takeoff and landing, the plant 
exhibited reactions which the scientists equated to panic and fainting." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson says she loves animals, but she warns vegetarians: "They should know 
that when the scythe falls on a stalk of wheat, it feels pain." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Fetta says she became a vegetarian the day she drove past that ghastly 
feed lot on Interstate 5 near the Harris Ranch, where thousands of cows await 
slaughter in crowded, treeless pens. Yes, I drove past that pen once and didn't 
eat a hamburger for two days. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Victor of Hollywood notes that vegetarians have been populous throughout 
history, and that today there are a growing number of "vegans" -- those who not 
only eat no animal products (including dairy or eggs) but also do not use 
leather, wool, down or silk. 
</P>
<P>
Bee Simpson of South Pasadena argues that "if Americans reduced their intake of 
meat, more grain would be released to feed directly the world's hungry, health 
would increase and more importantly one's spiritual well-being would be greatly 
enhanced." 
</P>
<P>
Randall Hinshaw, professor of economics emeritus, Claremont Graduate School, 
recalls that the late Sir Roy Harrod, an eminent Oxford economist, once told 
him that he hated cruelty to animals, but he was not a vegetarian. "On Kantian 
grounds, he argued that if the human race were suddenly to decide to abstain 
from meat-eating, millions of animals -- which otherwise would have had a 
contented existence, blissfully unaware of their ultimate fate -- would die 
slowly and miserably of starvation, because there would no longer be a 
commercial incentive to feed them!" 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lowry agrees: "I say hooray to man," he exults, "the predator who, alone 
among the carnivores, assures his prey of humane treatment . . . a lazy life 
with abundant supplies of food . . . a quick and relatively easy death, and an 
opportunity to serve a higher life form. It is a far better deal than most 
human beings get." 
</P>
<P>
I'll try to remember, the next time I go to Dodger Stadium, that the cow in my 
hot dog is getting a far better deal than most human beings get. 
</P>
<P>
And I'll remember that baseball is a game that could only have been invented by 
a higher life form -- in God's image.

NO DIRE EFFECTS FROM THE LACK OF SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Suppose that for one reason or another a man does not have sexual 
relations for a long time. What happens to the semen? Can going without sexual 
relations affect his health? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A lack of sexual relations over an extended period of time does not 
necessarily affect a man's physical or emotional health. After a while, there 
is a reduction in the amount of semen produced and, eventually, the sperm die. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Suppose a woman who is in the menopause has been told that she is not 
supposed to use estrogen, but she still gets symptoms of the menopause. What is 
she supposed to do? Is there anything she can take or is she just supposed to 
suffer? 
</P>
<P>
A: If your question refers to a particular person and is not of a general 
nature, I would strongly urge the woman to see a physician. Of course there are 
treatments that can be used if estrogen use is contraindicated as, for example, 
in the case of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
If a woman experiences hot flushes, for example, there is medication that would 
alleviate the condition. If the problem is vaginal dryness, lubrication may 
prove helpful. And even in the treatment of osteoporosis, for which estrogen 
replacement is the treatment of choice, other therapies are available. 
</P>
<P>
Women with menopausal symptoms should not suffer in silence. The first step is 
to see a physician. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any treatment for a child who walks in his sleep, or is it just a 
matter of letting him outgrow it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Treatment for sleepwalking must be pursued on a number of levels. For 
example, from the standpoint of safety, it would simply be common sense to make 
certain that there are no sharp objects and no glass in the child's room. If a 
sleepwalking episode does occur, the parent or other caretaker should not 
awaken the child but should calmly lead him or her back to the room and into 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
External factors, such as excessive fatigue or sleep deprivation, can trigger a 
sleepwalking episode; therefore, these aggravating factors should be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
More formal treatment approaches, such as psychoanalysis, have not been 
uniformly successful. Some authorities recommend traditional psychotherapy only 
for adults who sleepwalk and who have a definite psychiatric disorder.

PARTY FOR ABDUL-JABBAR BENEFITS CHILDREN'S GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retirement could be the best thing yet for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
On what other occasion would such a basketball legend be the recipient of 
countless gifts and tributes from fans? 
</P>
<P>
Even after his final regular season game Sunday, at which he received a 
Rolls-Royce, the accolades and presents keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
The latest was a black-tie benefit for Athletes &amp; Entertainers for Kids at 
the Century Plaza on Monday night. The organization, which supports and 
provides services for seriously ill children, gave the 42-year-old outgoing 
Laker center a six-hour-long send-off that included a cocktail reception, 
dinner, entertainment (taped to be shown in May on NBC) and an after-dinner 
party. 
</P>
<P>
The charity, however, took a back seat to the Kareem adoration fest. That began 
with a pre-dinner photo opportunity where he was given a watch, a Fender guitar 
and a bronze statue of himself, caught in mid-sky hook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1,000 Per Ticket 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar never even made it into the VIP reception, where guests who had 
paid $1,000 per ticket (the regular price was $500) mingled to the tune of a 
live jazz ensemble. Those included Esai Morales, Jonathan Prince, Angie 
Dickinson, Scott Valentine, Carl Weathers, Jasmine Guy, Laker coach Pat Riley, 
Billy Crystal and Ryan White, this year's junior chairperson for the event. 
</P>
<P>
White is the Indiana teen-ager who was banned from his school after being 
infected with the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion. Last year his name went 
on the Ryan White National Foundation for AIDS Education. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the dinner speeches explaining the background and purpose of 
Athletes &amp; Entertainers for Kids were lost due to a bad sound system and 
the drone of more than 1,000 guests in the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the children did benefit. 
</P>
<P>
That's due to the decision of the charity to allow about 250 children from 
hospitals, homeless shelters and rehabilitation centers to see the show. 
</P>
<P>
Said Athletes &amp; Entertainers for Kids founder and executive director Elise 
Kim: "We thought midway through planning the event that, gee, this is a great 
event for the adults, but since this is the only retirement gala in town, we 
wanted the kids we serve to attend." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Guiding Philosophy 
</P>
<P>
Kim admitted that inviting the children meant cutting down on profits. They 
expect to net $100,000 to $150,000; less than half of what they would have made 
had they sold those tickets. "It's more important," she said, "to stick to our 
basic philosophy, and that's trying to include the kids in our events." 
</P>
<P>
The children made use of their opportunity, carrying cameras and programs into 
the center of the room for snapshots and autographs of the Lakers, Farrah 
Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal, Whoopi Goldberg, L.A. Raiders' Howie Long and Marcus 
Allen, Debbie Allen, Bruce Willis, Elliott Gould, Quincy Jones, Martin Mull, 
Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., Patrick Duffy, Michele Greene, Joan Van Ark, 
James Caan and Peter Scolari, almost all of whom had some part in the show. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the line-up has earned a reputation as a Lakers fan (as one 
guest noted, "Did Joan Van Ark play a big part in Kareem's life?"), and 
conspicuously absent from the roster were die-hard supporters Jack Nicholson 
and Dyan Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Glover recalled meeting Abdul-Jabbar 22 years ago at a student conference 
while he was attending San Francisco State University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'll Miss the Artistry' 
</P>
<P>
"This was a guy who didn't have to be involved with the students," he said. 
"And ever since that time, I've been a Kareem fan. I've followed him every 
year. And you know, I'll miss the artistry and the beauty (of his playing). You 
remember a run, a sky hook, and it's very succinct in your head. It's more than 
sports. You're just gonna miss it." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Mull described himself as "The ultimate fan" of the Lakers (it's likely 
several people thought they had that distinction) and added, "There is no other 
basketball (team)." 
</P>
<P>
Any spontaneity the show might have had was lost in cue cards, long pauses and 
second takes. But there were some bright spots: Jackee singing "Your Feets Too 
Big" with the other Lakers as backup singers, Billy Crystal's comic 
reminiscences of his stint on his Long Island high school basketball team, a 
humorous biography recited by Elliott Gould and the pre-telecast performance of 
"Kareem's Dream Jazz Band," featuring Herbie Hancock, Stanley Clarke and 
Stanley Jordan. Unfortunately, they only got in one number. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's thank-yous were quick, and he acknowledged just about everyone. 
"Between yesterday and today," he said, "you guys have worn me out." 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry. There's probably another tribute next week.

AN ECCENTRIC LOOK AT CENTRAL AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Agony in the Garden: A Stranger in Central America by Edward R. F. Sheehan 
(Houghton Mifflin: $19.95; 362 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Edward R. F. Sheehan confesses to "a taste for the intrigues and convulsions of 
the Third World . . . an addiction for the poor tropics . . . a lust for new 
experience." All of these passions are fully indulged in "Agony in the Garden," 
a firsthand account of the tribulations of Central America through the eyes of 
a sympathetic if troubled American observer. "Central America is a garden," 
Sheehan writes. "The isthmus is also a Gethsemane, where human agony seems to 
flourish in biblical counterpoint to the luxuriance of the landscape." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, as Sheehan suggests, Central America is a land of sensualists. 
Certainly, Sheehan himself is a keen observer of sensuality, and "Agony in the 
Garden" is lush, sometimes almost lurid in its description of land and people 
alike. For example, when we meet a pair of young Contras who appear to be 
lovers as well as comrades-in-arms, Sheehan lingers over their sheer 
physicality. Leonel is "a slight, copper-skinned youth, perhaps 18, sensuous of 
face, with long black hair and the movements of a predatory leopard," and 
Rocibel is "17, a bit wide at the hips, as Nicaraguan women tend to be, with a 
lovely, wide-eyed white face." Their thoughts -- and their hands -- are "on 
guerrilla combat of another sort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Camouflage Gear 
</P>
<P>
Later, Sheehan takes us to a Sandinista hangout in Managua, where he finds 
himself surrounded by men and women wearing camouflage fatigues and side arms: 
"They were handsome, the men lithe with copper skin and lush mustaches, the 
women supple, of generous breasts and mouths too sensuous," he writes. "The air 
conditioner in the restaurant worked poorly or not at all, and in the wet air 
the odor of the women's young bodies added to their allure." 
</P>
<P>
I do not mean to suggest that "Agony in the Garden" lacks seriousness. Quite 
the opposite is true -- Sheehan has provided a useful, even indispensable 
introduction to the history and politics of Central America. He allows us to 
eavesdrop on conversations with generals and bishops, ambassadors and military 
advisers, itinerant padres and Contra foot soldiers. He wrestles with the most 
profound questions of morality and theology. And he contemplates, in 
unflinching detail, the rival ideologies and the rival terror of right and left 
in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Sheehan traces the terrible cruelty of political violence in 
Central America to 15th-Century Spain, which "sent to the new hemisphere not 
only the crucified Christ and His love but the terrors of the Holy Inquisition 
and the rapacity of the conquistadores." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sense of Theatricality 
</P>
<P>
But Sheehan, a novelist and playwright as well as a journalist and former 
diplomat, is perfectly willing to indulge in theatrical contrivance to enliven 
his book. Early on, he wanders into a brothel in a Honduran town, where he 
gallantly kisses the hand of a whore freshly risen from a night's work, and 
then he pays a call on the Bishop of Comayagya : "I genuflected to kiss his 
ring," Sheehan writes. "If I could kiss a whore's hand, I could kiss a 
bishop's." 
</P>
<P>
And he finds a celebrated Sandinista like Daniel Ortega much less compelling 
than the dwarfishcomandante Tomas Borge, a founder of the Sandinista movement 
and a poet who heads the secret police: "He's half-mad but brilliant," one 
unnamed ambassador tells Sheehan. "He can be merciful one moment and cruel the 
next. . . . He can't keep his hands off pretty blond women." 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan's book is also a kind of intimate confession, the tossings and turnings 
of a man in a nightmare of conscience over the sufferings of Central America. 
He is especially moved and troubled by the abandoned children who populate the 
streets, squares and sewers -- the infant beggars, the Resistoleros or 
glue-sniffers, the tender adoloscents who are press-ganged into the army -- and 
he tries again and again to rescue them. But the floodtide of misery overwhelms 
him each time: "Why am I doing this?" he wonders aloud. "Do I really care about 
these children, or am I just taking notes?" 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, Jesuit-trained and the bearer of a classical education and a refined 
sense of aesthetics, is superbly equipped to describe the curious juxtaposition 
of religion and revolution in Central America. He is clearly fascinated by 
iconography, and he provides us with descriptions of the fabulous Roman 
Catholic cathedrals of Nicaragua (". . . life-sized recumbent Christs in glass 
sarcophagi, wrapped in precious lace, weeping tears of painted blood. . . . ") 
as well as the agitprop imagery of the Sandinistas and their "Popular Church" 
-- "Here, Jesus Christ and Cesar Sandino were intermingled . . ., blend(ing) 
the deepest symbols of the Christian legend with the beatification of 
sandinismo." 
</P>
<P>
"Agony in the Garden" is a brilliant if eccentric book -- truly, I will never 
read another headline about Central America without recalling Sheehan's 
dreamlike images of beggar and whore, jungle fighter and privileged 
revolutionary, torture chamber and cathedral. (If I may be permitted to say so, 
the dust jacket by designer Michaela Sullivan is equally brilliant in evoking 
the sense -- and the sensuousness -- of the book.) And I find myself tempted by 
Sheehan's unconventional and otherworldly musings about the destiny of the 
people whose suffering he describes with tragic grandeur: 
</P>
<P>
"I see the sorrows of Central America as a religious mystery," he writes, "and 
I believe that all human problems, in the end, are theological."

Palm Springs mayor, restaurateur, former pop star and ex-husband of Cher, Sonny 
Bono has announced plans for what he said will immediately become the 
pre-eminent film festival in the United States and will eventually rival 
Cannes. The inaugural Palm Springs International Film Festival, tentatively 
scheduled to take place over five days in January, will be city-operated but 
privately funded, Bono said, with a format about equally split between glitz 
and competition. Speaking to a group of local business leaders at Maxim's Hotel 
in downtown Palm Springs, Bono said he has raised more than a quarter of the 
first year's $800,000 budget. He said the theme of the first festival, which 
will be a scaled-down model of the spectacles to come, will be comedy with 
about 35 international films being shown, plus major studio premieres, gala 
public events and a retrospective tribute to a major comedy star. Jennette 
Paulson, the director of the Hawaii International Film Festival, will serve as 
director of the Palm Springs festival as well. ALEENE MacMINN

There will be no more aerobics classes and scanty lingerie on NBC's 
"Nightingales" if the series is renewed for another season, producer Aaron 
Spelling vows. Spelling called a Tuesday morning news conference at the Century 
Plaza to announced that the American Nursing Assn., which has loudly protested 
the show's racy depiction of the lives of student nurses, has now pledged its 
support -- providing producers strive to create a more realistic portrait. 
Spelling said rushed production and last year's writers strike forced the 
show's producers to include scenes "we are not proud of." He added: "If a show 
depends on young women changing their clothes every two seconds . . . we don't 
want to do that show." ("Nightingales" airs tonight at 10.) ALEENE MacMINN

How big was "Roseanne's" lead in the ratings last week? So big that "Have 
Faith," the show that followed it on ABC, lost nearly one-quarter of 
"Roseanne's" 23.8 million households and still finished third among the week's 
83 prime-time programs, according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. 
Nielsen Co. Nevertheless, NBC continued to dominate the network race, finishing 
first for the 44th week in a row. The full list of ratings is on Page 8. 
</P>
<P>
* Things may be looking up for Grant Tinker and his GTG Entertainment. The 
company's first three network series bombed on CBS this season, but "Baywatch: 
Panic at Malibu Pier," the pilot for an NBC drama about lifeguards, won the 
battle of TV movies Sunday night. "Baywatch" attracted viewers in about 16 
million homes, while ABC's "Peter Gunn" drew about 13.3 million and CBS' "The 
Littlest Victims" garnered about 9.9 million.

Producer-director George Lucas of "Star Wars" fame is entering the commercial 
wars. His movie-making company, Lucasfilm Ltd., has formed a new advertising 
division, Lucasfilm Commercial Productions, to make television commercials and 
already has two projects in the works (for Bell Atlantic and Panasonic). Two 
other Lucasfilm divisions, Industrial Light &amp; Magic special effects and 
Sprocket Systems film editing, have worked on commercials, including spots for 
Subaru and Diet Coke. However, the new division marks Lucas' full-scale entry 
into commercial production. Lucasfilm Commercial Production will use some 
special effects but will rely primarily on live action. ALEENE MacMINN

New Zealand. 1988, 104 minutes 
</P>
<P>
7 p.m.

<P>
 This is no more than the usual two lovers-on-the-run car-chase thriller, 
spiced up with comic paranoia, interracial lovers, a tongue-in-cheek attitude 
toward violence, progressive jibes against the CIA and American big business, 
zingy seacoast scenery and a few welcome twists and jolts. But New Zealander 
Geoff Murphy ("Utu") is a contemporary action director in a league with 
Spielberg, George ("Mad Max") Miller, James Cameron, and John McTiernan; he 
keeps this wildly kinetic movie sizzling and popping, bouncing and roaring all 
the way. Settle in, undemandingly, for the ride -- and you should have a good 
time. RECOMMENDED.MICHAEL WILMINGTON

JAZZ NOTES : LOVING DUKE MADLY AS BIRTHDAY APPROACHES; ANDY SIMPKINS BACK TO

Duke Ellington, who died on May 24, 1974, would have been 90 this Saturday and 
in memory of his birthday, numerous celebrations are scheduled that day around 
the Southland. KUSC-FM (91.5) interrupts its usual 24-hour classical format to 
present "My Sparkling Parade," a 90-minute audio portrait of the great 
composer-bandleader-pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Airing at 6 p.m., the program includes interviews with Los Angeles Philharmonic 
Music Director Andre Previn, composer-author Gunther Schuller and Ellington 
collaborator Maurice Peress. In his interview, Schuller, author of the recently 
published "The Swing Era," places Ellington in the forefront of American 
composers, in the company of Ives, Copland and Gershwin. The show's musical 
examples will be drawn from previously unreleased Ellington symphonic sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Special live-performance Ellington fetes include the Santa Barbara City College 
Jazz Festival, where "A Birthday Tribute to Duke," featuring trumpeter Jon 
Faddis, pianist Billy Mitchell and others, will be held at the Arlington 
Theatre, 8 p.m.; and "Happy Birthday, Duke," at the Islander Cafe in 
Mid-Wilshire, where singers Tom Briggs and Lisa Nobumoto offer a tribute in 
song. No doubt Ellington tunes will be heard in other nightspots around town. 
</P>
<P>
BOUNCING BACK: Andy Simpkins, the bassist for the last nine years with singer 
Sarah Vaughan and a regular free-lancer in Los Angeles jazz clubs, is back to 
active playing after undergoing a hip replacement in January. 
</P>
<P>
After surgery, Simpkins -- who plays this Friday with the Gerald Wiggins trio 
at the Loa in Santa Monica -- kept playing at home. But he really missed 
getting out to clubs. "That was the worst part of my recuperation." 
</P>
<P>
Now, "playing is great," he said. "Guys tell me the gig's over and I say, 'Hey, 
we just got started.' " Simpkin's new solo LP, "Calamba" (Discovery), is due 
out soon. 
</P>
<P>
COOL CRUISE: The New American Orchestra, the locally based, symphonic jazz 
orchestra, is sponsoring "Rhapsody on Wheels," a fund-raising bike ride along 
the bike paths and beaches of Marina del Rey on May 7, beginning at 10 a.m. For 
a $21 entry fee, riders receive a T-shirt, an LP, a concert at the end of the 
ride and a chance to compete in a contest by identifying musical numbers, 
played by New American Orchestra members at points along the 14-mile course. 
Information: (213) 374-8990. 
</P>
<P>
***1/2 Bongo-Logic's "Cha-Cha-Charanga" (Rocky Peak) is the recording debut of 
the local salsa/Latin-jazz band. Led by percussionist Brett Gollin and 
featuring flutist Art Webb, violinist Harry Scorzo and pianist John Enrico 
Douglas, the group goes with the spritely "Juguetes," the haunting "Didi's 
Danzon" and a roaring version of Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps to Heaven. . . . 
"In a Jazz Tradition" (EmArcy) finds guitarist Eric Gale heading up a combo -- 
which includes bassist Ron Carter and saxman Houston Person -- where "jazz 
tradition" means "the blues." Gale -- who leans more toward the sparse, telling 
phrasing of a B. B. King than the hard-swinging quality of a Wes Montgomery -- 
injects blues feeling into everything from "Eric's Gale," a medium cooker, to 
Duke Jordan's classic "Jordu" and Tadd Dameron's "If You Could See Me Now." 
</P>
<P>
Recordings are graded on a five-star system. Five stars (*****) means all but 
indispensable for your jazz library, one star (*) means forget it.

SCOFIELD MIXES IT UP WITH MASTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Scofield, the guitarist who played with Charles Mingus, Billy Cobham and 
Jay McShann, among others, before coming of age with Miles Davis in the early 
1980s, brought his trio to the Catalina Bar and Grill. 
</P>
<P>
An infrequent visitor to the Southland, Scofield was greeted on the first night 
of his weekend gig with enthusiasm by a sparse crowd at the Hollywood night 
club. Considering the man's talents, the place should have been packed to the 
rafters. Working with bassist Anthony Cox and drummer John Riley, Scofield 
presented a set that mixed his own compositions with those of the standard jazz 
repertoire. In each instance, Scofield's technical mastery was matched by his 
musicianly approach. 
</P>
<P>
Though a trio setting for any soloist can pose problems, this one didn't for 
Scofield. Bassist Cox, whose solos were quite imaginative, played a larger part 
in quelling any sense of emptiness in the group's sound with his full sound and 
powerful harmonic structuring. So, too, did drummer Riley help fill any gaps 
with his "brush fire" of rhythmic activity. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield plays with a purposely distorted but attractively full sound, while 
never disguising his melodic or harmonic intent. His illustrious musical 
background provided him with an eclectic approach that, on "All the Things You 
Are," for instance, had him starting in a be-bop mode before finding a raucous 
and bluesy midsection that would have delighted Jimi Hendrix fans. He returned 
to be-bop with liberal "From Thelonious Monk." 
</P>
<P>
Though his music is enough to recommend Scofield to anyone interested in jazz, 
his presentation will disappoint those looking to be entertained. Hunched over 
his guitar, his level of seriousness is that of an artist -- not of a nightclub 
performer.A. JAMES LISKA

CURRIE CONDUCTS SCOTTISH EVENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BURROUGHS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Scottish Celebration," presented by the Los Angeles Master Chorale and 
Sinfonia Orchestra in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center, was no 
mere potpourri of ethnic hit tunes in arrangements beefed up for a big hall. 
</P>
<P>
True, canny Music Director John Currie did allow for more voices and 
instruments than seem to fit the Scottish tradition of narrative songs (14 out 
of 17 by Robert Burns), and his arrangements of the animated tunes tended to 
the loud and slapdash. 
</P>
<P>
But tenderness and intimacy were available as well: the sopranos alone 
("Willie's Fair"), the whole Chorale in hushed pianissimo ( "The Winter of 
Life"), a loving account of "Annie Laurie." 
</P>
<P>
However, the guests from Scotland really sparked the cumulative effect and 
deeper experience Saturday night, nothing less than the baring of the Scottish 
soul through music. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Redpath must be considered an indispensable ingredient of any such 
occasion. The renowned Scottish folk singer held the assemblage spellbound by 
the simplest yet rarest means: total love of and identification with her 
material and peerless artistry in its presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Folk fiddler Alasdair Fraser's solo turn ran the expressive gamut from deep 
Celtic melancholy to joyful jig, his fiddle imitations of the bagpipe almost 
unbelievable, the whole rendered with a humble sincerity, flawless virtuosity 
and just about the sweetest violin sound since Fritz Kreisler. BRUCE BURROUGHS

KCET OFFERS A PRIMER ON 'SURVIVING THE BIG ONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Surviving the Big One," airing at 8 tonight on Channel 28, KCET delivers a 
comprehensive primer on how to prepare for a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
And -- no small feat -- producer-director Joel Tator has kept "Big One" from 
being a dry lecture. "Big One" delivers a ton of information while being 
entertaining and engrossing. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of the credit goes to the show's host, Henry Johnson, a fire and 
safety specialist in the Los Angeles Fire Department. Johnson is on camera 
throughout "Big One"; his low-key demeanor and straightforward conversational 
style draw viewers into a solid, information-packed hour. 
</P>
<P>
As Johnson repeatedly stresses, the key to survival lies in proper preparation. 
According to Johnson, the thing that most Southern Californians fear the most 
-- the shaking motion of a quake -- is not going to be the main problem. The 
biggest area of concern will be the quake's aftermath, when there will be a 
serious lack of public services -- water, food, emergency medical assistance 
and so on. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key values of "Big One" is its skill in separating fact from 
fiction. Footage from 15 earthquake-prone locations coupled with Johnson's 
articulate explanations help overcome certain fears -- no, California is not 
going to break off and fall into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"Surviving the Big One" can't be recommended highly enough. Knowledge is power 
and, in this case, might be just the power to help you and your family survive.

ORDINARY ADVENTURE TALE OF 'THE FORGOTTEN' 
</P>

<P>
USA Network tonight debuts its World Premiere Movies with "The Forgotten"(9-11 
p.m.), a story of six American MIAs who are released from the hell of Vietnam 
into the hell of U.S. military and political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The first of 24 original movies that the cable channel has commissioned, the 
production is turgid and airless, a murky filament in USA Network's 
self-described "new" look. 
</P>
<P>
The cast features strong performances from Keith Carradine and Steve Railsback 
as the key MIA guys suddenly freed and whisked off to a U.S Army base in 
Germany after 17 years as Vietnam POWs. 
</P>
<P>
But the production's early going, particularly the debriefing scenes, are 
grueling. The show never develops a style or any zest. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Keach (whose brother James Keach produced, directed and co-wrote with 
Railsback) delivers a ho-hum performance that looks phoned in, playing a 
Nazi-like lackey for the National Security Council. He interrogates the gaunt 
MIAs as if they're all brainwashed traitors. That's because Keach's bosses in 
Washington have a lot to cover up. 
</P>
<P>
Cliches (check out Bruce Boa's unctuous Secretary of State) and fog (Americans 
shooting Americans on dark Bonn streets) choke the production. Meanwhile, 
flashes of welcome light flare along the story's edges from Don Opper, Richard 
Lawson, Pepe Serna and Michael Champion as other MIAs in the group betrayed by 
Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
It's this unevenness, even in the lighting, and the flat, by-rote action scenes 
(the show was shot in Yugoslavia) that make the adventure ordinary at best, 
stifling at worst.RAY LOYND

Argentina's currency continued to plunge against the U.S. dollar in an 11-week 
slide that has driven up inflation and threated to kick off social unrest. The 
country is undergoing an "unprecedented emergency," said Saul Ubaldini, the 
general secretary of the four million-member General Labor Confederation, as 
inflation neared a record 40% this month. At mid-day Tuesday, Argentines paid 
102 australs for each dollar, a 19% devaluation from the previous day. Interest 
rates paid by banks reached 80% a month as financial institutions tried 
desperately to keep investors from removing deposits.

NEWSMAKERS: QUAYLE VISITS SAMOA, DECIDES HE'LL GIVE IT A BREAK

One of the advantages of being vice president, apparently, is that you can 
declare holidays. At least that's what Dan Quayle did for the people of 
American Samoa. "You all look like happy campers to me," the vice president, 
who was decked out in sweet smelling leis for his visit, said as he spoke to 
about 2,000 natives gathered for his brief stopover en route to Australia. 
Quayle had flown from Hawaii. Leaving the plane in Pago Pago, Quayle and his 
wife, Marilyn, were greeted by village elders dressed in sarongs and carrying 
long walking sticks. Schoolchildren waved small American flags and cheered as 
the vice president and his wife blotted sweat from their brows in the tropical 
heat. After encouraging the Samoans to pursue their education, Quayle said: "I 
have the power to declare this a holiday -- you can have the rest of the day 
off."

native son. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg 
joined Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in launching a statewide appeal to fund a statue 
at the Statehouse of the late President John F. Kennedy. "Now on the grounds of 
this Statehouse that he loved, Jack will stand among us for the ages, forever 
young, reminding all who serve here and pass by here of his achievements for 
the nation and his commitment to excellence in public life," Sen. Kennedy said. 
Schlossberg, 31, the late President's eldest child, said the fund-raising 
effort "will encourage and inspire" others toward public service. The 
eight-foot bronze statue, which is being created by artist Isabel McIlvain, 
will depict the 35th President in full stride with his left hand tucked into 
his jacket pocket. The overall goal of $400,000 includes maintenance and 
scholarship money.

First Lady Barbara Bush accepted the 1989 Albert Schweitzer Leadership Award at 
the annual Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation dinner in New York for her work in 
promoting literacy. She assured the 800 guests that she was fully recovered 
from her recent thyroid treatment, and added: "George said I remind him of Yogi 
Berra, who when asked if he had seen Dr. Zhivago, replied: 'Why should I? I 
feel fine.' That goes for me too." SHIRLEY MARLOW

San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos said he will support a newly introduced domestic 
partners proposal that would provide gay and lesbian couples with some of the 
benefits that married couples receive. "I look forward to signing" the 
proposal, Agnos said during a press conference called by Supervisor Harry Britt 
to introduce the measure. Among other things, the proposal would require the 
city to provide partners of gay and lesbian city employees with the same health 
insurance and other benefits that opposite-sex spouses receive. Britt said he 
was assured of support from the majority of supervisors and expects a vote on 
the measure in May. In 1982, Britt proposed similar measure that was passed by 
the board of supervisors, but was vetoed by then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein.

Jurors in the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North completed 
another day of deliberation without a recurrence of medical complaints that had 
marked their previous day's work. A Public Health Service nurse examined juror 
Jean Johnson, 53, who had complained of high blood pressure Monday, and no 
further difficulties were reported from the jury room. Two other jurors with 
heavy colds were reported still at work. Having finished 21 hours of 
deliberation over four days, jurors were transported to their hotel for the 
night with instructions to resume their sessions this morning.

A key figure in two federal investigations involving Washington Mayor Marion 
Barry was convicted in U.S. District Court in the Virgin Islands of drug 
trafficking. Former Virgin Islands government consultant Charles Lewis, 48, was 
found guilty of two counts of drug possession and two counts of distribution in 
the sale of $550 worth of crack, a cocaine derivative, to undercover FBI agents 
last month. Lewis faces felony charges in Washington in a separate case in 
which District of Columbia police reportedly were called off an attempted drug 
buy from Lewis while Barry was visiting his hotel room in the city. A second 
investigation focuses on a joint district-Virgin Islands personnel project, 
which Lewis headed until he was fired because of cost overruns.

One of four Polish secret police agents convicted in the 1984 kidnaping, 
torture and murder of pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy Popieluszko has been freed 
from prison, government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski said. He had said earlier 
that Waldemar Chmielewski would be released. The priest had drawn thousands to 
monthly sermons in Warsaw in which he urged that the banned union be 
re-legalized. After Popieluszko's death, Solidarity declared him patron of the 
union, which was restored to legal status this month. Chmielewski had been 
sentenced to 14 years in jail; the others received 15- or 25-year terms. The 
sentences have been reduced twice in three years.

Arson destroyed a truck parked in front of the Orange County offices of the 
Vietnamese-language Nguoi Viet Daily News, Westminster Fire Marshal Glen Hines 
said. A threat, written on a wall in Vietnamese, said, "Nguoi Viet, if you are 
VC (Viet Cong). We kill." Hines said the newspaper's publisher, Do Ngoc Yen, 
attributed the incident to a news segment mistakenly broadcast Saturday by the 
TV studio that shares the editorial offices. The program, "Truyen Hinh 
Vietnam," apparently offended some ardently anti-Communist members of the 
Vietnamese community when it showed the Communist flag of Vietnam and Ho Chi 
Minh's mausoleum in Hanoi as a visual background for a Vietnamese entertainer's 
song. The publisher, who co-owns the studio, said he will publish an apology to 
the Vietnamese community today.

A weeklong truce was shattered when Muslim militia members, backed by Syrian

police said. Initial reports said one person was killed and 13 wounded in the 
four-hour shelling of the Lebanese capital. The flare-up came hours after the 
United Nations called on the warring factions to end six weeks of bloodshed -- 
and on the eve of a conference of Arab League foreign ministers in Tunis aimed 
at solving the conflict. A series of brutal battles has claimed 250 lives since

BUSH TAKES DRUG FIGHT TO O.C. SMUGGLING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

President Bush toured a former drug baron's mountaintop hideaway Tuesday in his 
first visit to Orange County since the election, delivering $4.39 million in 
seized drug assets to local police and challenging the nation to help destroy 
"these chemical weapons of death and destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Flying into secluded Rancho del Rio in extreme southern Orange County on a 
Marine Corps helicopter, Bush joined with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburg, Customs 
Commissioner William Von Raab, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and Orange County 
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates in praising the efforts of law enforcement agents 
and a federal law that allows officials to confiscate assets from drug dealers 
and turn them over to drug-fighting forces. 
</P>
<P>
"All of you here today are fighting fierce battles in one of the largest and 
toughest drug markets in the country," Bush told the crowd of 1,400 invited 
guests at the 213-acre ranch, which was seized in 1985. "The community here is 
united. You are an example of hope, determination and the true American 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's 2-hour stay in the county was orchestrated to highlight his stern 
anti-drug message. He delivered it amid the backdrop of large mounds of 
contraband drugs and seized cash -- 10s, 20s, 50s and 100s -- bundled together 
to simulate $4.39 million in drug assets now going back to the Regional 
Narcotics Suppression Program. 
</P>
<P>
The money was part of $5.2 million in cash seized by the countywide drug task 
force in February, 1988, and returned under a 1984 federal law that allows 
confiscated drug assets to be used by law enforcement agencies in the war on 
drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called the money "the bounty of defeated drug criminals. We won't stop 
until we nail every coward who deals in death and put them all where they 
belong." 
</P>
<P>
The president went on to make an appearance at UCLA, but returned to Orange 
County on Tuesday evening for an unpublicized visit to Anaheim Stadium, where 
he watched an Angels' game with team owner Gene Autry in a private box. 
</P>
<P>
To further highlight his anti-drug campaign, Bush earlier Tuesday lunched 
privately with 60 undercover drug officers, most of them from the regional task 
force composed of officers from 23 Orange County police departments and several 
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
He called the undercover officers "the unsung heroes who risk their lives to 
save our kids. We thank them." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his appearance, the President signed an anti-drug pledge card, 
then accepted a black-and-white jacket with the slogan: "Drug Use is Life 
Abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Before his speech, Bush was given a walking tour by Gates of the sprawling 
ranch in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains, getting a firsthand look at 
a barn with a trapdoor that led to an underground area for storing drugs. The 
President also saw a van and a pickup truck with false bottoms that were filled 
with drugs and money when they were seized by agents who swept down on the 
secluded ranch 4 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the ranch, Daniel James Fowlie, is being held at a jail in La Paz, 
capital of Baja California Sur, and is awaiting extradition to the United 
States on drug charges. He was indicted in November on 26 felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of you know the history of the ground we stand on," Bush told the guests, 
most of them local dignitaries and Republican activists bused in for the event. 
"It was the core of an international marijuana and cocaine smuggling ring. How 
many lives -- how many families -- how many hopes and dreams have been 
destroyed with these chemical weapons of death and destruction: drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Once a Warehouse of Death' 
</P>
<P>
"Once a warehouse of death, now it's a source of hope. Rancho del Rio has been 
reclaimed." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Orange County's multiagency drug unit, Bush said its agents had 
confiscated almost $40 million in cash and enough cocaine to provide "15 doses 
for every man, woman and child in Orange County. Do we need any other reason to 
win this war? 
</P>
<P>
"Let these funds go to fighting the war they once financed. And let us send a 
message, loud and clear, to every drug merchant in America: You are out of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Asset forfeiture laws have become one of the most powerful weapons in the 
government's anti-drug fight. Since 1984, when the forfeiture law was enacted, 
Thornburg said the government has seized $250 million in drug-related assets. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Rancho del Rio is "the first piece of forfeited drug property turned 
over for use by local officials in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Gates has proposed turning the ranch into a training center for drug agents. 
Bush referred to that plan in his address. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2 Million to Prepare Ranch 
</P>
<P>
But county officials said Tuesday that they have not decided what to do with 
the property. Doug Woodyard, an analyst with the County Administrative Office, 
said it would cost $2 million to prepare the ranch for use as an academy, 
because it does not have sewers, electricity or a paved road. The county has 
considered selling the property, but officials said Tuesday that various 
options are being studied. 
</P>
<P>
The President also called on Southern California's entertainment industry to 
become more involved in fighting drugs, saying that "television, music and film 
are a positive influence. My entreaty is, use that influence wisely, to do 
good." 
</P>
<P>
To loud applause, Bush then added: "I never want to see a movie again that 
makes drug use into something humorous. It is time that they got behind this 
crusade." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's brief visit went without incident. But at one point before his speech, a 
KABC-TV plane violated the closed airspace around the site and was escorted 
away by a Marine Corps helicopter. The Secret Service said it does not consider 
the matter a serious incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Biggest U.S. Drug Dealer' 
</P>
<P>
The only downside to what otherwise was a positive, upbeat appearance for the 
President in predominantly Republican Orange County came as Bush supporters 
were bused out of Rancho del Rio. They were greeted by about a dozen protesters 
along Ortega Highway, near Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park, who held signs 
reading: "Bush is a Sleaze" and "OC Hosts Biggest U.S. Drug Dealer." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters' spokesman, who identified himself only as Ark, said the 
demonstrators were from Earth First and the Greens, a network of political and 
environmentalist groups. He said that drugs should be legalized and that 
leaders should be working for world peace. 
</P>
<P>
After his county appearance, Bush flew on to UCLA for a meeting with a mostly 
Republican group of Latino community leaders, thanking them for their support 
in the fall presidential election.

STATE STUDY FINDS NO THREAT FROM GANGS AT JORDAN HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jordan High School in Watts, which for months has been in the middle of a 
dispute over the safety of its students, is "a well-run inner-city high school 
with students who have great pride in their school" and not threatened by 
neighborhood street gangs, according to a brief state Department of Education 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The study, compiled during a recent visit to the school by officials of the 
state attorney general's office and the Department of Education, is a rebuke to 
a women's group that has charged that tension between rival gangs makes it 
unsafe for children from the Imperial Courts housing project in Watts to walk 
to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study Called a 'Whitewash' 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Dutton, president of the politically conservative American Assn. of 
Women's Los Angeles office, on Tuesday called the state study a "whitewash." 
</P>
<P>
Dutton's group earlier this year filed complaints with the U.S. Department of 
Education's Office for Civil Rights, complaining that many children from the 
housing project have stopped going to Jordan because of "life-threatening and 
dangerous conditions in the classrooms, on the campus and in surrounding 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
School officials have called the charges overstated and dismissed them as a 
personal vendetta against Jordan by one of the association's officers, Ezola 
Foster, a former Jordan teacher. 
</P>
<P>
According to a letter sent to the association two weeks ago by state Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig, "street gangs do not pose a clear and present 
danger to the operation of the school or its students." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students Feel the Same 
</P>
<P>
Similar sentiments were voiced last month by more than 1,000 Jordan students at 
a school pride rally attended by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Honig said that staff members visited Jordan, observed several 
classes, interviewed several students and met with Principal Grace Strauther. 
Neither Honig nor Jordan officials were available for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton, who said her organization was not aware of the study until it received 
Honig's letter, said it was "ludicrous" for the state to reach any conclusions 
without interviewing any of the parents who have complained about Jordan's 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton's group contends that the rivalry between one gang of Crips in the 
Imperial Courts housing project and another Crips gang in the Jordan Downs 
project next to Jordan High has resulted in attacks on Imperial Courts 
students. About 150 Imperial Courts residents attend Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
While Honig's letter spoke glowingly of Jordan High, it did not address the 
core issue of the safety of students who walk to and from the school from 
Imperial Courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear the state Department of Education is nothing more than an 
accomplice in a whitewash of the true facts surrounding Jordan High School," 
Dutton and Foster wrote in a letter mailed last week to Honig. "This is an 
adequate reason to substantiate our need to call on the federal government to 
launch a thorough and complete investigation of all allegations." 
</P>
<P>
Honig's letter noted that "very few, if any, teachers have requested to 
transfer out of Jordan for safety reasons." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for that, the association replied in its letter, is that "most 
teachers will not come forward due to fear for their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the group's complaint to the Office for Civil Rights, Los 
Angeles school district officials said any Imperial Courts students who wanted 
to transfer to other schools would be permitted to do so. Dutton's group says 
that about two dozen students have transferred. 
</P>
<P>
The association earlier this month filed a second complaint with the Office for 
Civil Rights, charging that the school district "illegally retaliated" against 
the students who complained. The district has denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Warren Furutani, whose district includes Watts, said he had 
not seen Honig's letter but said, "I appreciate their comments because they 
actually went and looked."

DEATHS OF 2 HORSES CITED IN HALTING OF POLO GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by the deaths of two horses after injuries in a polo match last month 
and the rumored deaths of other horses, the Department of Animal Regulation on 
Tuesday shut down the glitzy indoor arena polo games at the debt-ridden Los 
Angeles Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the city department said the management of the center in Griffith 
Park has illegally held the polo contests in the 3,500-seat Equidome without 
having a permit for the matches or other shows, such as rodeos. They said an 
investigation is under way to determine whether center officials had also 
violated state humane laws in the treatment of horses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Department's Blessing 
</P>
<P>
Polo matches have been played with the knowledge and blessing of the city 
Recreation and Parks Department, which has allowed such contests at the center 
since 1983. Officials of that department said they were not aware that the 
center's management did not have the proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of questions about what's going on out there, and until we 
answer them, they can no longer have arena polo at the center," said Michael 
Burns, district supervisor for the Animal Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
He said it could be up to a year before the center can obtain a permit to hold 
any horse-related shows. 
</P>
<P>
The move could mean the end of the 11-game polo season at the center and the 
glamour that surrounds the events. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities such as actors William Shatner, William Devane and Mickey Dolenz 
and singer Juice Newton frequent the matches as well as play polo. One official 
said the matches are attended by the "Cadillac and champagne" set that dine on 
cracked crab and calamari cocktail during the action. 
</P>
<P>
Two thoroughbred polo ponies had to be destroyed when they broke legs during 
the first minutes of a March 11 match, officials said. Burns said he had also 
heard accounts of two other horses being killed at the center in the past but 
said he had not confirmed the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Horse boarders at the center, which is on property owned by the city of Los 
Angeles, have also complained to officials about horses with large open sores 
being ridden during the games. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, which operates the center, 
called the department's action toward polo "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Harrison, general counsel for Gibraltar, said city officials had not 
notified Gibraltar of the shutdown and had failed to return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an outrageous procedural thing by the city," he said. "This is 
uncalled for. We welcome an inspection. We also note that this kind of accident 
occurs frequently in race tracks around the country. The city has accused us of 
intentionally harming animals, and we deny that." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said the revenues from the polo matches were important to the center, 
which is more than $2 million in debt and is losing $80,000 to $100,000 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"This will hurt us, but hopefully not fatally," he said. "The season accounts 
for between 8% to 10% of our yearly revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"But without the matches, the public begins to lose interest, and they wonder 
about the financial viability of the place. It has a domino effect." 
</P>

Burns said he did not feel that the center deliberately failed to get the 
proper permits. He said recreation and parks officials and center management 
were probably unaware that the documents are required. 
</P>
<P>
Polo -- a team game in which riders attempt to shoot a ball through goals with 
a mallet -- involves a significant amount of pushing and bumping of horses, 
which is all legal, unless a rider "bumps" off an opponent at an angle greater 
than 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We do know that horses have died doing this. But we don't know if it's an 
unsafe event unless we can see how they are cared for," Burns said. "We have to 
make sure they're in good shape. You can't send a horse into these events 
without them being in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Burns said he would have a veterinarian inspect the horses for old and new 
injuries. He said he wanted center officials to provide him with records of 
horses that have been injured or killed during the polo matches.

CITY HONORS OFFICER SHOT FATALLY IN '83 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flags at Los Angeles City Hall were flown at half staff Tuesday in honor of a 
police officer who was mortally wounded more than five years ago -- a shooting 
that paralyzed him and placed him on a slow path toward death. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Los Angeles Detective Norman R. Eckles, 42, died Thursday at Daniel 
Freemen Memorial Hospital. The cause of death, the county coroner's office 
said, was "acute and chronic" infections related to a bullet wound that he 
suffered while trying to serve a narcotics search warrant in South-Central Los 
Angeles on Dec. 1, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office now lists Eckles as a homicide victim. His assailant, 
however, will not face a new charge of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Eckles, in essence, outlived the statute of limitations for murder. Sandy 
Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, explained that the 
law requires that death occur within three years and a day of "the fatal 
stroke" for murder charges to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Eckles' assailant, Edwin P. Donelson, is serving a 22-year term at Tehachapi 
state prison. He was convicted in 1985 of two counts of attempted voluntary 
manslaughter, two counts of assault on a peace officer and one count of assault 
with a firearm. Donelson also inflicted lesser wounds on another police 
detective and a passer-by. 
</P>
<P>
Donelson opened fired when Eckles and another officer, identifying themselves 
as police officers, tried to enter Donelson's apartment in a surprise predawn 
raid. Eckles' partner tried to force the door open and Eckles broke a window 
"as a diversionary tactic," he said in a 1984 interview. 
</P>
<P>
At Donelson's trial, Eckles testified: "Everybody was screaming 'Police!' I 
know I said 'Police, we have a search warrant' . . . at least twice. . . . I 
heard a shot. The next thing I knew, I was on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot Missed Vest 
</P>
<P>
Eckles was wearing a bullet-proof vest, but the bullet entered from the side, 
beneath his right armpit and lodged in his spine. 
</P>
<P>
The wound immobilized him from the chest down, forcing him to take a disability 
retirement. He took 20 different medications to deal with constant pain, said 
Eckles' wife, Cynthia. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Eckles remained active in law enforcement. From his wheelchair, the 
former narcotics detective testified frequently in court as an expert on 
narcotics cases. 
</P>
<P>
Eckles also served as a police consultant, lecturing officers on "safety and 
survival," Los Angeles police spokesman Bill Frio said. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after the shooting, Eckles said in a hospital room interview: "I 
used to think a badge would protect me. I used to think the badge covered my 
whole body, but it was a little short that morning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'My Saddest Day' 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, upon his retirement, Eckles said: "This is the saddest 
day of my life -- I don't want to retire." 
</P>
<P>
Eckles, who lived in Upland, is survived by his wife, daughters Tracy Lynn 
Paulik and Tammy Eckles, son Norman J. Eckles and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a policeman until the day he died," his wife said in a statement 
released by police officials. "He loved the LAPD. It was always important to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Full police rites are planned for 10 a.m. today at the First Baptist Church, 
601 N. Garey Ave. in Pomona. Interment will be at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in 
Covina.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PILE OF LUMBER FALLS, KILLING EX-MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cam Briglio, former Monterey Park mayor and city councilman, was crushed to 
death Tuesday by a stack of lumber that fell on him at his home in the 600 
block of Orange Avenue, police said. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
Police and Fire Department officials responded to calls from a neighbor, who 
said she heard a loud crash followed by Briglio's pleas for help, Police Sgt. 
George Verbeck said. Firefighters located Briglio under the pile of lumber in a 
back room of the house, Verbeck said. Power saws were needed to cut through the 
lumber and extract Briglio, who died about an hour after arrival at Garfield 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Briglio served as mayor from Feb. 9 to Dec. 14, 1987. In Monterey Park, City 
Council members are appointed to the office of mayor on a rotation basis. 
</P>
<P>
Briglio's term on the City Council lasted from April 10, 1984, to April 12, 
1988, during which he survived a recall effort initiated by opponents who 
differed with Briglio over real estate development issues. He lost his bid for 
reelection in a campaign that featured heated debate over the development issue 
as well as the city's changing ethnic makeup.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOSPITAL BACKS OFF ON CUTBACK THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The emergency room at Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte will remain open to all 
patients, its board of directors decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital had warned that it might stop accepting patients brought to the 
emergency room in ambulances unless state and county officials approved a plan 
to convert 23 hospital beds to more profitable use in an affiliated nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's proposal was submitted to the county Health Services Department 
in August. Mike Costello, the hospital's executive vice president, said that 
after "a long bureaucratic stalemate," the Los Angeles Office of Statewide 
Health Planning and Development approved the change April 13. The Health 
Services Department must still act on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Teresita lost $400,000 in operating the emergency room in 1987. Losses 
climbed to $600,000 last year. Officials say they can cover the losses with 
money made from the new beds in the nursing home.

POLICE SAY BOY DROVE JEEP INVOLVED IN FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jeep that struck a BMW in a fiery head-on collision that killed a teen-age 
girl in Emerald Bay over the weekend was driven illegally by a 15-year-old boy, 
California Highway Patrol officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officer Raul Martinez said that the boy, who had told authorities he was a 
passenger in the Jeep and that a 17-year-old was driving, was himself the 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
"Several witnesses have come through. . . . We have positively identified the 
driver," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Hacker, 16, of Newport Beach died from injuries suffered in the Sunday 
night collision. Authorities said the Jeep driver, going south on Pacific Coast 
Highway, had veered to avoid hitting a car coming from an exit road, when it 
hit the BMW. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said the accident is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We had people calling the office saying they had observed the Jeep driving 
recklessly on the highway at speeds exceeding 70 m.p.h.," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY FINDS WAY TO CASH IN ON RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors, while still hoping to woo back the Los Angeles 
Raiders, agreed Tuesday to sublease county land for a parking lot that could be 
used by Irwindale if that city builds a proposed football stadium as the team's 
new home. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan outlined by Supervisor Pete Schabarum, Irwindale would pay the 
county either $400,000 or -- if it is higher -- 14% of the annual gross parking 
receipts from Raider games and other events where parking fees are charged. 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale would also agree to provide $10 million over the next decade to 
finance the construction of a charro, or Mexican rodeo, facility to be operated 
by the county Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors said the arrangement would enable the county to benefit financially 
if the Raiders should move while leaving them in a position -- if the move 
should collapse -- to persuade the team to continuing playing at the Los 
Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Ed Edelman cast the dissenting vote. "I for one don't want to 
aid them in getting out of the Coliseum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is subject to approval by Irwindale officials and the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, which owns the county-leased land.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: J. C. PENNEY FINED IN WASTE-DUMP CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J. C. Penney Co. Inc. was fined $53,000 Tuesday in Whittier Municipal Court 
after pleading no contest to two misdemeanor counts of dumping hazardous waste 
into the Puente Hills Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea bargain with the district attorney's office, two misdemeanor 
charges against the company were dismissed, as were charges against Christopher 
Muzquiz, a building maintenance supervisor at a Penney facility in Santa Fe 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said flammable liquid in barrels was discarded during cleaning of 
the Santa Fe Springs facility and dumped at the landfill Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The company has already paid the costs of cleaning up the illegal disposal, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. William Carter said.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: HIS NEXT GLOBAL JOURNEY WILL BE EASIER ON HIS FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Kunst, 49, figures there's only one great adventure left for him, since 
he has already walked around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'd like to sail around the world," said the Costa Mesa apartment manager, 
who took 4 years, 3 months and 16 days to complete his 14,500-mile walk, which 
started from his home in Waseca, Minn. He doesn't plan to take that long to 
complete his voyage. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, the voyage may be years away. But if Dave Kunst can walk around 
the world, he can do anything," he said. "If you have good health, you can do 
anything. And I have good health." 
</P>
<P>
Kunst is listed in the latest edition of the Guiness World Book of Records, 
which also printed a picture of him and his Portuguese mule, Willie-Make-It II, 
the animal that carried his equipment during much of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Kunst started the global walk with his younger brother, John Kunst, who was 
shot and killed by bandits in Afghanistan. David was also shot, but after 
recuperating in the United States, he went back to the scene of the shooting to 
continue his walk. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since he finished the walk in 1974, Kunst has been talking about the trip 
to anyone who will pay him or listen to him. His biggest audiences are usually 
at school assemblies. He charges $190 for a two-part talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I deliver an upbeat, motivational, goal-setting talk to stimulate all those 
things in kids," said Kunst, who now wakes up at 3:30 a.m. to deliver 
newspapers. "That's how I stay in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Kunst said he could talk for hours about why he took the walk and how he set 
goals to do it. "I wanted to do something different," he said. "I wanted to be 
adventurous, just like a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
In virtually every town he passed through, Kunst was interviewed, partly 
because of his authorization to use the walk to raise money pledges for UNICEF, 
the U.N. emergency fund for children. At one point, a Newsweek correspondent 
walked along. 
</P>
<P>
Kunst said his talk has "adventure, tragedy, romance and intrigue." The romance 
comes in the story of his marriage to Jenni Samuel, whom he met at a party in 
Australia. "She helped me with the walk by driving a car 1,000 miles in low 
gear while I walked beside it," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel is now a teacher at El Camino Real Elementary School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
To reach his new goal, Kunst and another brother, Peter Kunst, 45, of Newport 
Beach, bought a sailboat and are taking sailing lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"After we get some sailing experience and raise some money, we're going to take 
off," he said. "We even have the route picked out." 
</P>
<P>
When David Kunst delivers his talk to more mature groups, such as senior 
citizens or fraternal organizations, he tells them: "I never want to go back to 
an 8-to-5 job, and I've never been one to go out and bust my butt for money." 
</P>
<P>
And getting older shouldn't be an obstacle, Kunst said. "I tell senior citizens 
we both may have to go slower, but we can do it. When my time is up, I would 
rather it happen while I was sailing than when I was sitting in a rocking 
chair." 
</P>
<P>
It's a good thing Jennifer Toth, 37, has a degree in psychology, because she 
spends her days listening to complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I had to understand was that the complaints were not directed 
at me," said Toth, who heads the new consumer affairs department for the Irvine 
Chamber of Commerce. "I had to get beyond the point where I felt people were 
picking on me." 
</P>
<P>
Toth, the mother of two children, said the chamber's pilot program "was meant 
for me," noting that she has worked as a store manager and has a consumer 
background. 
</P>
<P>
She said her office got 71 complaints the first 2 weeks after it was 
established recently on a 16-month trial basis. "But most of them were about 
one company. Most businesses are legitimate, but every so often, we get some 
fly-by-nighters that move into town and create a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Toth, who lives in Irvine, said other consumer people advised her to "get a 
thick skin." Still, there are rewards, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every so often someone will call or write a letter and say thank you." 
</P>
<P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIT-RUN SUSPECT SEIZED AT CHP OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Antelope Valley man was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter in 
connection with a hit-and-run fatality after he went to a California Highway 
Patrol office to report that his pickup truck had been damaged in an accident, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
David Arnold, 49, of Quartz Hill was taken into custody in the death of John D. 
Zumwalt, 35, of Lancaster, who was struck about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday while 
attempting to walk across Avenue I, just west of 10th Street West and dragged 
nearly 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
When Arnold went to the Lancaster CHP office Tuesday afternoon, Sgt. Richard 
Wood said, officers noticed that his truck matched the description of the one 
that struck Zumwalt. Wood said investigators at the scene found evidence 
linking Arnold's truck to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told deputies that the hit-and run driver drove onto a curb in an 
apparent attempt to dislodge Zumwalt's body from the undercarriage, Wood said.

A diver who failed to surface off Santa Catalina Island on Sunday has been 
identified as a 20-year-old La Puente man who was a rescue air crewman with a 
Navy helicopter unit. 
</P>
<P>
Navy authorities in San Diego said Tuesday that Eric A. Flores, an aviation 
machinist's mate and airman apprentice, was on liberty with other members of a 
diving club Sunday morning when he sank 120 feet to the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
His companion failed in an attempt to pull Flores to the surface. Other divers 
searched for about four hours and the Coast Guard made a surface search by 
helicopter, but found no trace of Flores.

KRAFT DEFENSE GOES HIGH-TECH IN ATTACK ON COMMONALITY OF SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With some high-technology visual aids, an attorney for Randy Steven Kraft 
argued to jurors Tuesday that there were too many discrepancies in the 16 
slayings his client is charged with to think that one person committed them 
all. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Kraft, said defense attorney C. Thomas McDonald, "is a 
painting by a very clever prosecutor, to make these acts appear as if they were 
done by a single perpetrator." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 44, is on trial in Santa Ana, accused by prosecutors of killing more 
people than anyone else in California history. While he is charged with the 
murders of 16 young men in Orange County, prosecutors have linked him to 45 
specific victims in Southern California, Oregon and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown contends, each entry on a list 
found in Kraft's car stands for one of Kraft's victims. It has 61 entries, with 
five of them -- "2 in 1 Hitch" and "GR2," for example -- representing double 
victims, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Victims Mutilated 
</P>
<P>
Brown completed his closing arguments Tuesday morning by suggesting that the 
fact that two victims had been burned on the eyeballs and nipples with 
cigarette lighters makes it unlikely they were killed by different people. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got the person here in court," Brown told the jurors. Brown, who began 
his closing argument Monday, finished shortly after noon Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After the lunch break, the courtroom lighting was dimmed and a 67-inch, 
self-contained rear-screen projector was placed before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Then McDonald, with the help of computer expert David Parkin, flashed on the 
screen blue and white moving graphs and pie charts McDonald said were designed 
to show the numerous dissimilarities in the 16 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald and co-counsel James G. Merwin are expected to take all day today to 
complete their closing arguments. Brown is then scheduled to present his 
rebuttal argument Thursday morning.

Judge Donald A. McCartin warned jurors that on Thursday afternoon, after he has 
given them their instructions, he will sequester them at a hotel to begin 
deliberations. The judge has announced he will also permit them to deliberate 
on Saturday, rarely done in Orange County criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The judge left the bench to find a seat in the corner to watch the defense's 
computer graphics display. McDonald presented 10 displays intended to show 
discrepancies among the victims: the types of drugs and varying alcohol levels 
found in their systems, the causes of death, their personal features, where 
their bodies were found and how many were Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution would have you believe that all these victims died of ligature 
strangulation," McDonald said. But his color graphic showed that seven died of 
ligature strangulation and nine died of other causes. 
</P>
<P>
In his rebuttal, however, Brown is expected to show that in the nine other 
cases, most of them had some signs of injury to the neck or face. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin, who represents a legal graphics support service in Mission Viejo, 
declined to say how much Tuesday's presentation cost because all defense costs, 
which come from public funds, are sealed by court order. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sits Near Jury 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, a computer expert himself, was permitted to leave his seat and move 
closer to the jury so he could watch the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 deaths vividly displayed on the screen occurred between 1972 and Kraft's 
arrest on May 14, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In the older cases, where prosecutors have no physical evidence directly 
linking Kraft to the victims, Brown is relying on their commonality with 
murders for which he does have physical evidence. For example, most of those 
victims were found with a shoelace missing. Brown contends Kraft drugged his 
victims, then tied their wrists with their own shoelaces. In murders where he 
does have stronger evidence, shoelaces are missing too. 
</P>
<P>
But in his closing argument Tuesday, McDonald contended that there were so many 
other discrepancies that nothing clearly points to Kraft leaving his 
"signature" on these victims.

VANDALS SEEKING FASTER ACTION ON AIDS WARD STRIKE COUNTY BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Protesters splattered the downtown Los Angeles County Hall of Administration 
building with red paint and handprints and plastered marble pillars with 
posters demanding the establishment of an "interim" medical ward for AIDS 
patients. The vandalism was the second such incident in four days. 
</P>
<P>
The graffiti, which included a stenciled sign with the words "AIDS Unit Now," 
was discovered in the predawn hours Tuesday, and crew workers spent until 
mid-morning scrubbing the building clean as an angry Board of Supervisors 
denounced the vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Irresponsible and Illegal' 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of behavior is irresponsible and illegal," board Chairman Ed Edelman 
said. "That is no way to make a point." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, supervisors sought to reassure AIDS activists that 
county officials are working as fast as possible to establish a 20-bed ward at 
County-USC Medical Center for patients with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
But the facility, which is scheduled to open in September, will accommodate 
fewer than half of the 51 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses who are 
scattered in various wards in the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of hospital beds, coupled with the five-month wait until the ward's 
opening, has apparently been at the core of the graffiti protests, and angry 
AIDS activists, while denying any involvement in the vandalism, accused county 
health officials Tuesday of dragging their feet in establishing an interim AIDS 
ward. 
</P>
<P>
They asserted that the Department of Health Services and its director, Robert 
Gates, have ignored a board order directing the department to find an area in 
an existing ward where AIDS patients can be grouped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Want a Response' 
</P>
<P>
"We want a response from the county that is adequate. We are tired of 
government bureaucracy telling us it doesn't matter. We are tired of government 
genocide," said Connie Norman, a member of ACT-Up Los Angeles, an AIDS activist 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Norman and other members of ACT-Up told the supervisors that AIDS patients 
would receive better care if they are immediately housed together in a special 
ward. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Sol Bernstein, medical director of County-USC Medical Center, defended 
the care that AIDS patients receive and expressed reservations about 
establishing an interim ward before the special AIDS ward is completed in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to supervisors, Gates voiced a similar view, recommending that 
an interim AIDS ward not be established at the hospital, in part because it 
would pull significant resources from other hospital areas, including emergency 
and intensive care wards. 
</P>
<P>
He also said later that it was doubtful that the AIDS ward could be completed 
any earlier than the fall. "We can look and see, but it is a very aggressive 
timetable already," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked About Graffiti 
</P>
<P>
At one point, supervisors asked the activists if they were responsible for the 
graffiti that marked the marble walls and glass doors of the Hall of 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't condone it, nor do we condemn it," she said. "But we understand the 
anger that motivates it." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, red paint was spilled on the steps of the health services building, 
and the slogan "Down With Gates" was spray-painted at an entrance way along 
with posters covered with handprints. Gates said it cost $8,600 to remove the 
paint, and no one has been arrested.

SAN CLEMENTE BLUFF SLIDE CLOSES COAST HWY., MARS 5 YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of a 20- to 30-foot bluff in San Clemente collapsed Tuesday morning, 
sending portions of five residential back yards tumbling onto Coast Highway and 
closing the heavily traveled coastal thoroughfare to traffic through this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Patio decking and as much as 20 feet of real estate disappeared from back yards 
along La Ventana, leaving houses 50 to 60 feet from the new edge of the bluff. 
But no houses were immediately threatened and no injuries were reported, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The landslide, which occurred at about 8:40 a.m., left an 8-foot deep, 30-foot 
long barrier along the northbound lane of Coast Highway about a quarter of a 
mile north of Camino Capistrano. Although homes on the bluff are in San 
Clemente, the state highway below is in Capistrano Beach, and workers from the 
Orange County Fire Department and Environmental Management Agency, from 
Caltrans and from San Clemente responded to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highway Closure Forced 
</P>
<P>
The slide forced closure of both highway lanes from Palisades Drive in 
Capistrano Beach to Camino Capistrano in San Clemente, and California Highway 
Patrol officers said the road probably would not be reopened until at least 
noon today because of the threat of more landslides. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look like much, but then when you start digging down into it to get 
it out of here, it turns out to be a lot," Craig Hunn, a San Clemente public 
works employee, said of the debris piled on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 cubic yards of earth fell, about the same amount that fell onto the 
highway several years ago at nearby Palisades Road, according to William 
Reiter, county public works operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 loads were trucked away Tuesday before workmen quit for the night, 
Reiter said. Crews would resume work today, including knocking loose portions 
of the bluff that appeared about ready to collapse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had one like this for quite a while," said San Clemente City 
Councilman Thomas Lorch, who came to view the damage. "The last big one we had 
in San Clemente. . . . That's when they restriped (Coast Highway) from two 
lanes to one lane (in each direction). Now I'm sure it'll stay that way." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, workmen pulled down patio decking that was part of the back yard at 
2819 La Ventana until it fell over the new edge of the bluff. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God, you mean, my house?" owner Edward Makasjian, a 61-year-old retired 
real estate agent who alternates between living there and in Downey, said 
Tuesday when contacted by the Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw something on the news this afternoon about this thing in San Clemente, 
but I didn't know that my house was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Even people living near the landslide were unaware anything had happened, so 
quiet was the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything about it until I was out in front and there were two 
ladies walking in front of one of the houses trying to see what was going on," 
said Richard Vaughn, who lives on La Ventana three doors from the slide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of Yard Lost 
</P>
<P>
Gaylene Zaione, who lives at 2817 La Ventana, lost about 15 feet from the right 
side of her back yard. The slide undermined the foundation of a new patio, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente reserve police were on guard at Zaione's home to prevent 
sightseers from going into her back yard. Others were on Camino Capistrano and 
Coast Highway directing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Zaione said that when she moved into the house about a year ago she expected 
some minor slides, but nothing like this one. "I had three geology reports 
done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Reiter said he doesn't expect landslides around the area will cease. 
</P>
<P>
"I think anybody that lives on this cliff is in jeopardy because, let's face 
it, that cliff has been eroding for years, and it's still going to be eroding 
for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Road Closure 
</P>
<P>
Both lanes of the Coast Highway between Camino Capistrano and Palisades Drive 
will be closed this morning. Caltrans and county workmen will finish removing a 
piece of the bluff which has a crack.

TRUCK BURNED AT NEWSPAPER; 
</P>
<P>
ARSONISTS PROTEST TELEVISION SHOW FOR VIETNAMESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arsonists set fire to a pickup truck parked in front of the Westminster 
editorial offices of the Vietnamese-language Nguoi Viet Daily News late Monday 
and scrawled a threat in Vietnamese saying, "Nguoi Viet. If you are VC (Viet 
Cong). We Kill," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Fire Marshal Glen Hines said that "it appears somebody poured an 
inflammable liquid" on the front of the truck, which is owned by the newspaper, 
and set it aflame around 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Hines estimated damage to the truck at $4,500. 
</P>
<P>
The threatening message in heavy crayon on a wall is believed to have stemmed 
from a Vietnamese television program, which aired 3 days ago and angered some 
Vietnamese residents who hold strong anti-communist views, said Do Ngoc Yen, 
the newspaper's publisher and co-owner of the studio that produces the news 
program, "Truyen Hinh Vietnam." The studio is housed in the editorial offices 
of Nguoi Viet newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
After the program's broadcast Saturday on KSCI Channel 18, Do said he spent 
part of the weekend explaining to leaders of Orange County's Vietnamese 
community and others that the program "had mistakenly" showed the Vietnamese 
flag and Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum in Hanoi -- symbols that often draw highly 
emotional reactions in the Vietnamese community. The program used them as a 
background to a nostalgic song about the fall of Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
"It made us look like we made a propaganda film for Vietnam," Do said in an 
interview Tuesday. "It was a mistake, and I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
Hines said authorities are regarding the arson "as a potential threat and an 
act of aggression towards him (Do Ngoc Yen). . . . It's the political 
ramifications which we're worried about." 
</P>
<P>
To help appease members of the community, Do also is planning to publish a 
banner-sized apology in today's issue of Nguoi Viet Daily News. A similar 
apology will be taped for the TV program scheduled for Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Do blamed a technician for using portions of an old news tape for part of the 
program's entertainment segment. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought they needed some image of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) in the 
background and one of our technical staff looked in the shelves where we keep 
old material and found clips of Saigon," Do said. 
</P>
<P>
The clip was originally shown 2 months ago during a news broadcast about 
Vietnam's present economy. Do said the program's staff wanted to contrast 
Hanoi's official claim of economic recovery with scenes of poor people in the 
streets of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, it fitted in with the community's anti-communism spirit," Do 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Do said he broke what he described as "the unwritten rule" of Vietnamese 
language media in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community of Exiles 
</P>
<P>
"It's a community of exiled people," Do explained. "And so anything that 
resembles a symbol of Vietnam, alone and without words to explain your 
position, is a violation." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Do said he has been the target of threats. But the arson 
represents the most direct action taken against Do. 
</P>
<P>
Nguoi Viet Daily News has expressed anti-communist views ever since it began 
publishing in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The paper has refused to publish politically sensitive material including 
advertisements for travel to Vietnam or for companies seeking to ship medical 
goods, bicycles and other items to Vietnam. And in recent issues, Do has 
published articles about anti-communist protests at UCLA when films produced by 
the Hanoi government have been shown. 
</P>
<P>
"In my case, we are clearly anti-communist and very critical of the authorities 
in Vietnam," Do said.

ATTORNEY APPOINTED FOR MURDER VICTIM'S DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mission Viejo woman arrested last weekend on suspicion of hiring three people 
to kill her father appeared in Orange County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel 
on Tuesday to have a lawyer appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Blair T. Barnette appointed Orange County lawyer Jack M. Earley 
to represent Deborah Ann Werner, 40, who, along with her three co-defendants, 
is being held without bail in Orange County Jail in connection with the death 
of her father, David Werner, 72, a retired stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was discovered in his Mission Viejo bedroom at 1 a.m. April 16, with 
a knife plunged through his neck, Orange County Sheriff's Department officials 
said. An autopsy showed that Werner had been smothered before he was stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Werner was arrested Saturday, a week after she had called police to 
report finding her father's body. Investigators said they found inconsistencies 
in her story. 
</P>
<P>
She is charged with hiring Carrie Mae Chidester, 20, of Huntington Beach; 
Charles L. Clemmons, 20, of Anaheim, and Miguel Ruiz, 21, of Garden Grove to 
kill her father so she could collect on "several hundred thousand dollars" from 
his inheritance, sheriff's officials have said. The three co-defendants were 
also arrested last weekend and booked into the jail without bond. 
</P>
<P>
All four were due to be arraigned Tuesday, but only Werner, Chidester and 
Clemmons appeared in court. Court officials said Ruiz had refused to appear. 
Barnette continued the arraignment until May 5 after also appointing attorneys 
for Chidester and Clemmons.

OIL PRESSURE NOT A PROBLEM IN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An air safety investigator said Tuesday that evidence indicates there was no 
oil pressure problem aboard the Piper Aerostar that crashed and burned on a 
tennis court in Newport Beach on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
That finding appeared to rule out a problem in the oil system as a possible 
cause of the crash, which killed a Canadian family of five, said Jeff Rich, an 
investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. The oil system had 
come to the attention of investigators because pilot Anthony Deis had asked 
mechanics at Martin Aviation to check his plane for a possible oil leak three 
days before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Rich also said that the propeller blades on the plane's right engine appear to 
have been "feathered" before the crash, which killed Deis, his wife and their 
three daughters. Feathering tilts the angle of the blades so that they provide 
less drag during an engine failure. 
</P>
<P>
The propellers on the left engine were not feathered, Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
Rich cautioned that it is still too soon to conclude that the right engine 
caused the crash or that a foam rubber seal sucked into the right engine's 
turbocharger is to blame. "We're still researching the plane's fuel lines and 
the investigation is continuing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB officials disclosed Monday that a lab test found traces of the seal in the 
engine's turbocharger. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know how significant that is," Rich said Tuesday. "Under some 
scenarios it could mean very little would happen but under others it could 
produce catastrophic results." 
</P>
<P>
The Deis family had vacationed in Orange County and was on its way home to 
Camrose, Alberta, when the plane crashed minutes after taking off from John 
Wayne Airport.

2 UCI BRAIN RESEARCHERS HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two world-renowned brain researchers at UC Irvine have been elected to the 
National Academy of Sciences, one of the highest honors a scientist can 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced Tuesday that honors went to James McGaugh, chairman of the 
department of psychobiology and director of the Center for the Neurobiology of 
Learning and Memory; and Ricardo Miledi, a distinguished professor of 
psychobiology and founder of UCI's Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular 
Neurobiology. 
</P>
<P>
Miledi was elected as a foreign associate of the academy, an honor bestowed on 
researchers who are not U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The academy, which has its Western headquarters at UCI, elected 60 new members 
and four foreign associates this year. Members total 1,573; foreign associates, 
262. The academy was established by Congress in 1863 to advise the federal 
government on science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
The honors are the latest of many for McGaugh and Miledi. McGaugh, former vice 
chancellor and executive vice chancellor at UCI, has studied the effects of 
drugs, hormones and electrical stimulation on memory storage. McGaugh has 
received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American 
Psychological Assn. and the UCI Extraordinarius Award. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, McGaugh is the founding editor of the Journal of Behavioral and 
Neural Biology and has been on research committees for the National Institute 
of Mental Health and the National Research Council. He has also been a governor 
of the American Psychological Assn. and has been at UCI since the campus was 
founded in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Miledi, who came to UCI in 1984, is an expert on the physiology of synapses -- 
the point at which messages are transmitted from one neuron to another -- and 
the transmission of those messages to muscles. His research into how the brain 
processes information has led to treatments for nervous disorders including 
myasthenia gravis. 
</P>
<P>
Miledi was named one of two winners of the $100,000 King Faisal International 
Prize for science and medicine last spring and has received the Luigi Galvani 
Medal for excellence in neuroscience research. He is also an honorary member of 
the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Mexico, Miledi lived in England for 26 years and holds British 
citizenship.

ORDINANCE WOULD RESTRICT JETSKIS

<TEXT>
<P>
The launching and operation of jetskis, motorized surfboards and the like will 
be restricted along the Newport Beach shoreline if an ordinance introduced by 
the City Council early Tuesday is adopted next month. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the proposed ordinance is scheduled at the May 8 Newport 
Beach City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Because Newport Beach has the least restrictive jetski regulations of all 
county coastal cities, the city Marine Department said in a report to the City 
Council, there has been "a rapid increase" in jetski use there. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid conflicts among swimmers, surfers and jetski riders, Newport Beach's 
parks, beaches and recreation commission drafted the ordinance, noting that all 
other county cities with beachfront homes bar jetskis year round. 
</P>
<P>
It prohibits beach launching of the vessels from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. from May 1 
to Sept. 30. When the vessels are operated outside of those months, they are to 
be used no nearer the shore than 100 feet seaward of the surf line -- although 
that distance may be increased at next month's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Jetski manufacturers and enthusiasts have opposed restricting their use. 
However, by the time the ordinance was introduced shortly after midnight, there 
were just 15 people in the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
No one spoke against the ordinance. The only speaker in favor was Thomas P. 
Pratte, executive vice president of the Huntington Beach-based Surfrider 
Foundation, a conservation group that focuses on public access and recreation 
rights, particularly surfing. 
</P>
<P>
"Jetskis and anybody else in the water just don't mix," Pratte said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the noise for others in the water "is like 20 neighbors running their 
lawn mowers at once." NANCY WRIDE

HIS KIND OF PLACE; 
</P>
<P>
FATHER HARRIS' REPUTATION FOR SUCCESS PRECEDES HIM TO SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Michael Harris, principal of Santa Margarita High School, steps out of 
his office and into a lobby with a high ceiling and six crystal chandeliers. 
With time only to glance at a newspaper sports section on a secretary's desk -- 
$26 million builds a beautiful school but it can't buy a minute of free time -- 
he reads the headline of a story detailing his school's difficulties in finding 
an athletic league in which to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Athletic Assn. doesn't want the Catholic school because of 
transportation problems -- some trips would be about 90 miles, one way. The 
Orange County public school leagues are wary because they fear Harris' school 
will become what he created at Mater Dei High in Santa Ana, an athletic 
behemoth free to cull talent from any area. 
</P>
<P>
Harris says: "I can't read all this, someone give me the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
A secretary, smiling as she attempts to bring something new to old lines, 
answers, "Father, we are not loved." 
</P>
<P>
Without breaking stride, Harris quips, "So, what else is new?" 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita is. Its classrooms have been open for less than two years, but 
the concerns over what it is and what it will become are rooted in the past and 
have fueled the current debate of where the school belongs athletically. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of it all is Harris, a 42-year-old priest who would rather hug than 
shake hands, who says, "I didn't go into the priesthood to become a big-time 
administrator," and yet who has the penchant for building success -- visible 
and dazzling success -- with exceptional administrative skills. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have made a great PR man," said Bob Ickes, Mater Dei baseball coach. 
"He would have made some big company a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Harris' reputation precedes him. It's a reputation that places him as one of 
the area's most able educational administrators, but also placed him at Mater 
Dei when that school was repeatedly rumored to be actively recruiting kids in 
less than the spirit of sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
When Newport Harbor Principal Dennis Evans said, "Santa Margarita seems to be 
the unfortunate heir to a legacy of past parochial problems," there's little 
doubt he was at least partially pointing to what Harris created at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Harris admits that some of Santa Margarita's problems getting into a league 
stem from his association with Mater Dei. But he says, "I never really thought 
of myself as a terrifying or intimidating force." 
</P>
<P>
Either way, he is now at Santa Margarita, a school that he first saw as "some 
open land with grazing cows," which has become, according to the National 
Catholic Educational Assn. in an article in The Times, the nation's most 
sophisticated Catholic high school, complete with its own cable television 
channel, computerized research facilities and state of the art classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Half the money to build it was gathered by passing the collection plate. Harris 
and others raised the other half by getting 295 big spenders to give $13 
million. Still, there is no doubt this is Harris' school. 
</P>
<P>
The late Bishop William R. Johnson offered Harris the post of principal six 
years ago, before the first nail was struck on campus. Harris refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very comfortable at Mater Dei," said Harris, who took over as that 
school's principal at age 29. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson decided that Harris was the man for the arduous task of raising 
funds and starting a new high school from scratch. He told Harris to make the 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
"He is principal there, because he is the best man," said Bishop Norman F. 
McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
Harris calls himself "a hands-on administrator." He is very visible, very 
demonstrative, hugging students as they pass. 
</P>
<P>
"He treats it as if it were his home," said Rich Schaaf, Santa Margarita 
athletic director. "He's got his finger on everything." 
</P>
<P>
A teacher at another Catholic high school, who asked that his name not be used, 
said Harris' style has earned him the nickname "Father Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
At a welcoming assembly during the school's first day of classes, Harris opened 
up his traditional black tunic to expose a big Superman "S" on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I encourage people, I provide the structure by which things can happen," he 
said. "My managerial style tends to be participatory. My style is hands-on, 
literally and figuratively." 
</P>
<P>
"I read that (Walt) Disney believed it was his job to pollinate and encourage 
and support; I see that as my task. Encourage and support so that the kids can 
reach for the stars." 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Harris, the way to the stars does not pass only through the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"In all the counseling I've done as a priest, I've never had an adult come to 
me and say their life was falling apart because of poor algebra," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He strongly believes the role of schools goes beyond the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"He always strived here to present his holistic philosophy of education," said 
John Merino, Mater Dei's activities director. Merino has been at the school for 
32 years and directed a young Mike Harris as the lead in a play called, "The 
Worm Will Squirm." It was a comedy in which Harris played a buffoon of a school 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
"He was involved in drama and music and student council," Merino said. "And he 
believes in educating the whole child. Physically, academically, aesthetically 
and psychologically." 
</P>
<P>
So strong sports programs, just as all extracurricular activities, teach 
children, "more than reading and writing, they learn about life and how to live 
it," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
A well-worn school administrative line, but few, if any county administrators, 
back up the line with such passion and results. And so, as he did at Mater Dei, 
he has aggressively gone about building that part of the school up. 
</P>
<P>
No one begrudges Harris a fine program. But there are high school 
administrators, none of whom wanted to be quoted by name,who question Harris' 
motives and methods. They don't think public schools should have to compete 
against a school with built-in advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all very fine what he's accomplished," said one, "but the significant 
question is how has he done it, and if we can't do it that way, why should his 
school be in our league." 
</P>
<P>
Harris hears the grumblings but says, "No one ever says anything to me." 
</P>
<P>
"The open enrollment issue, which is the main reason so many public schools are 
reluctant to allow us to play them, I think that is a legitimate concern," he 
said. "I agree with that. But we've been thrown together in this thing, and we 
have to make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to question that his school will have an extremely strong athletic 
program; the only questions are about when and how dominating the program will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be the Mater Dei of that end (south) of Orange County," said 
Bob Dowding, Orange Lutheran athletic director. "There's no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
One newspaper article suggested that the very sight of Santa Margarita's campus 
could be considered a recruiting tool. Jeff Zippi, athletic director and 
baseball coach at Capistrano Valley Christian High, which competes against 
Santa Margarita in the Olympic League, joked that his staff considered giving 
parents the wrong directions to the school for a game "so they wouldn't see 
this beautiful thing." 
</P>
<P>
Zippi did give the right directions and Santa Margarita promptly became "the 
talk of the town. Our parents were very impressed," Zippi said. 
</P>
<P>
But Harris believes his school would attract parents and their children, "even 
if we had established it in Quonset huts. I really don't think the principal 
reason parents send their kids here are the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
He might be right. They would probably go there for him. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, his greatest quality is charisma," McFarland said. "People are 
instinctively attracted to him." 
</P>
<P>
And once attracted, many become fiercely loyal. 
</P>
<P>
"If he got a new parish and asked me to be his gardener, I'd take the job," 
Schaaf said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Sharp worked as a fund-raising consultant for Santa Margarita. He said the 
first time he met Harris he got a "sense a radiance and energy . . . If he ran 
for governor, I'd vote for him." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, others would not. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose everyone would like to be liked universally," Harris said. "But I 
also know that's not very realistic. If we're not popular because of the things 
we've accomplished, we'd find equally as much criticism if we did things 
mediocre." 
</P>
<P>
History tells him so.

TITANS PIN DOWN A NATIONAL TITLE . . . IN BOWLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The neighborhood kids used to tell Jeff Carr that his favorite sport would 
never get him anywhere or anything. 
</P>
<P>
A job at the local lanes, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
Now it has secured a national championship -- although hardly of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. variety -- for Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Carr and five teammates went to Las Vegas last week and came home champions -- 
the National Collegiate Bowling champions. They're not exactly hanging banners 
in Titan Gym or moving aside any NCAA baseball or softball trophies, but for 
the team, it's a thrill just the same. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all a bunch of weirdos, but we have fun," Carr joked. 
</P>
<P>
He and teammates Jim Marcoly, Robert Magee, Glenn Wada, Anthony Salib and Mike 
Goffinet practice -- for free -- at Titan Bowl, a campus facility in the 
University Center. 
</P>
<P>
It's not quite like being a big-time athlete. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Carr had a little trouble convincing a professor that he needed 
to postpone an exam because of a national bowling championship. It sounded like 
a shady excuse, but the professor allowed it. 
</P>
<P>
For another, eligibility rules are a bit less stringent than those that govern 
NCAA athletes. Although the team is required to maintain a "C" average in at 
least 12 hours of course work, rules are considerably loose concerning prize 
winnings. Carr won an auto a couple of years ago and last week won $400 as a 
guest in a professional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"You can accept money as long as you're not declared a professional," said 
Carr, who might try to bowl professionally after college. 
</P>
<P>
At Las Vegas, the team was led by Goffinet, whose average score in the 
championships was 196. Fullerton edged Wichita State and Washington State to 
win the 12-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people around here don't really know we have a team," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
Including that professor. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe now if I show him the trophy, he'll believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Rex Peters was named a Big West player of the week after going 
seven for 14 with three doubles, a home run and six runs batted in four games 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
In games against San Jose State Friday and Saturday, Peters reached base seven 
consecutive times. In Saturday's game, he doubled home the winning run in the 
eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
A first baseman and right fielder who played at Orange Coast College, Peters is 
batting .351 with 16 doubles and five home runs. He leads the team in on-base 
percentage (.477), walks (25), runs scored (48), is eight for eight on 
stolen-base attempts and is the only Titan player who has started every game. 
</P>
<P>
"Hate the candidates? Tired of frat lock?" began one campus campaign flyer for 
student elections for Associated Students president. "Write in Cedric 
Ceballos." 
</P>
<P>
Two students who wish to remain anonymous circulated the flyer -- without 
consulting Ceballos, who, by the way, received 27 votes in last week's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos' qualifications, as listed by the flyer: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Averaged 21.9 points per game and nine rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Players choice, Big West Conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can dunk in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
His fictional platform: 
</P>
<P>
"Cedric Ceballos supports clean air, higher education, world peace, the whales 
and the seals, homeless relief, a cure for cancer, health food and water 
conservation. VOTE FOR CEDRIC." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Three more high school wrestlers have signed letters to attend Fullerton -- 
Dwayne Buth (Spring Valley Mt. Miguel High School), Lyndon Campbell (Sante Fe 
High) and Michael Grubbs (Oceanside El Camino High). Buth won the state 
championship at 165 pounds and had a 42-1 record with 35 pins this season. 
Campbell is a two-time state champion at 138 pounds in 1986 and 1987. Grubbs 
has finished in the top five in the state championships three times at 105 or 
112.

NEW YORK GROUP SHOWS INTEREST IN CSUN SPORTS ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge administrators are working with a New York-based 
conglomerate, gathering information that may lead to a joint venture in the 
construction and management of a multiple-purpose sports arena on the CSUN 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Ogden Corp., which manages concessions at major sports 
arenas nationwide, including the Forum, have met twice with school officials 
since the start of the year, Elliot Mininberg, vice president for 
administration at Northridge, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN is scheduled to jump to NCAA Division I in athletics in September, 1990. 
The Matadors currently play at the Division II level, using the school's 
3,000-seat gymnasium as their home court for men's and women's basketball games 
and volleyball matches. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of Ogden's interest in financing an arena will depend largely on a 
feasibility study by Ogden that is expected to be completed by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge first must compile information on its past attendance figures and 
concession sales and formulate future projections in those areas. Also under 
scrutiny will be the school's need of home dates for athletic events and 
practices. It is expected to take two weeks to gather the information. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden's subsidiaries are capable of handling everything from building and 
financing the proposed complex to managing the facility. Ogden Financial has 
the capability to finance the project, with Ogden Projects doing the 
construction and Ogden Allied handling management and concessions 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a total, full-service project," said a member of Ogden's management team 
who spoke on the condition his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
Mininberg said that Northridge and Ogden were brought together by the 
architectural, engineering and planning firm of Howard, Needles, Tammen and 
Bergendoff. HNTB has been involved in the design and construction of the Harry 
S. Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City, Mo.; Giants Stadium at the 
Meadowlands, N. J., and more than 50 other sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden has been particularly active on the West Coast lately. It already has 
secured the exclusive rights to build an arena in Anaheim and has made a bid to 
do the same in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful that their review will result in continuing interest on their 
part and the opportunity to realize a first-class arena on this campus in less 
time than it might take us if we were forced to go independently," Mininberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The school would prefer to finance construction of an arena with private 
donations, which would allow exclusive use by Northridge teams with less regard 
to profitability. The odds on that happening, however, are close to zero. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a closed door," Mininberg said, "but our ability to 
accomplish something like that in the matter of a short time is somewhat 
remote." 
</P>
<P>
Better are the chances that Northridge will ask for public donations to 
supplement a partial offer of financing by Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
"We are, in fact, talking to some people of significant wealth who have 
interest in the university," Mininberg said. "To accomplish a first-grade arena 
of the quality that Ogden is looking at, I don't think we can do it without 
some outside assistance." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, state money might become available for the project if classrooms 
and office space are incorporated into the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get some folks like Ogden interested to help capitalize this, and some 
private donations, and the state's appropriation process to participate, then 
we have more than a lick and a promise of getting this thing done in a 
reasonable amount of time," Mininberg said. 
</P>
<P>
That's three big "ifs," if you're keeping score, but school officials seem to 
reason that they will be better for the experience even if Ogden's interest 
wanes. 
</P>
<P>
At least they will have a professional opinion about the obstacles that lie 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we know in a generic sense that we need a facility, but we don't 
have a good sense about what size it should be in order to pay for itself," 
Mininberg said. "Hopefully, they can give us a clear focus on the total cost, 
which will give us an idea of what we need to attract from the state and from 
our private donor's list." 
</P>
<P>
The arena project, considered little more than a pipe dream only a few months 
ago, is now considered vital for the school's ever-improving image. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Mininberg put it, "This is a step toward becoming first-rate 
athletically, which we feel will lend itself to a quality surge in the academic 
environment as well."

Gabriel Ruelas, puncher, turned into Gabriel Ruelas, boxer, Tuesday night at 
The Showboat Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
After knocking out six of his first nine opponents, the unbeaten 18-year-old 
super bantamweight from North Hollywood turned to finesse, defense and sharp 
combinations to win a unanimous four-round decision over Mario Lozano (22-8) of 
El Paso. Ruelas won every round on all three judges' score cards.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
HELP ARRIVES AFTER THEFT AT RESEDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Stone wanted his team to steal some bases. Instead, his team's bases were 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 And their bats. And batting helmets. And balls. And catching gear. 
</P>
<P>
Stone, the Reseda High baseball coach, was flabbergasted last week when he went 
to the team's supply shed and found the cupboard bare. 
</P>
<P>
Not even a doughnut was there. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody busted the door off," Stone said. "All of it (the equipment) was 
stolen. It wiped out our entire baseball supply." 
</P>
<P>
Stone estimated the loss of equipment at $1,000, including eight aluminum bats 
that belonged to the players. Stone donated $100, $250 came out of student body 
funds and the father of a former player donated baseballs. "People just kind of 
came to our rescue," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Easton Aluminum Inc., a Van Nuys sporting goods company, donated eight aluminum 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Stone gave me a list of every bat that was stolen," said Mike Danford, 
the company's product manager for bats. "We tried to replace them one for one." 
</P>
<P>
Danford estimated the value of the replacement bats, including an additional 
prototype bat that the company plans to market this summer, at between 
$600-700. 
</P>
<P>
"They've really saved us," Stone said of Easton. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the new bats, perhaps the Regents can still save themselves. Reseda 
is 4-11 and last in Mid-Valley League play at 1-10. 
</P>
<P>
The missing Link?: Sylmar's newly hired basketball coach, Larry Link, realizes 
that he has his work cut out for him. He was hired last week to replace Billy 
Reed, who left the program after three losing seasons. The Spartans were 3-13 
last year and rarely have had reason to brag about their basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting from scratch," Link said. "We're known for baseball and we have 
an up-and-coming football program. Basketball has been viewed only as the 
season between those sports. Maybe we can change that attitude so that people 
look at basketball as equal to the other two sports." 
</P>
<P>
Link, 44, is a 1968 graduate of San Fernando Valley State (now Cal State 
Northridge), where he played basketball and baseball. He played basketball for 
one year in Europe before becoming a tennis coach. His only basketball coaching 
experience came from 1982 to '84 at Hamilton High, where he replaced Yutaka 
Shimizu when the current Kennedy coach transferred. 
</P>
<P>
Earning his stripes: It was the last college basketball game for Simi Valley 
baseball Coach Mike Scyphers, and it also marked the end of his short-lived 
movie career. 
</P>
<P>
The cable station Showtime has been airing a movie titled "Candy Stripe Nurses" 
in its red-eye time slot this month. As a senior point guard at Cal State 
Northridge, Scyphers briefly appears in uniform during game action. The movie 
features Scyphers and several teammates in a win over Fullerton State in the 
1974 season finale at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, a 76-minute bomb that was given a one-star rating in the TV 
listings, is rated R and has all the melodrama, suspense and skin that its name 
implies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever seen the whole thing," said Scyphers, who said he has 
received phone calls from friends reminding him to watch. "I remember one 
(teammate) had a pretty big role, and that the hair and clothes of the actors 
looked pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, yeah, when the actors wore clothes. Lucky for Scyphers, his basketball 
career ended on a better note than did "Nurses." Scyphers nailed a 
just-for-the-heck-of-it toss from half-court as the game and his career ended. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't make the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteside's white knight: Poly's Harold Whiteside, who suffered a broken jaw 
March 29 when he was hit by a pitch and has been playing ever since with his 
mouth wired shut, nearly dropped his jaw when his coach told him of the plans 
of an area dentist. 
</P>
<P>
After an item about Whiteside's injury was published, a Van Nuys dentist called 
Coach Jerry Cord and offered to make Whiteside a protective mouthpiece, free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd done it before and that he'd like to help Harold if he could," 
Cord said. "When he told me how much it would normally cost, I made sure Harold 
made it down there." 
</P>
<P>
Paid to stay: How much is a high school baseball game worth? Well, to the 
Highland Hall Hawks, a Westside League game against Grace Community carried a 
$75 price tag for just one player. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks each kicked in $5 to keep junior third baseman Steve Francis in town 
for a few more hours. Francis was scheduled to return home to New York City and 
would have missed a first-place showdown with Grace Community. 
</P>
<P>
Francis' parents moved from New York to teach at Highland Hall but returned 
East two weeks ago. Francis stayed through the weekend to attend the school's 
senior prom and extended his departure a few more hours to play in the Hawks' 
8-3 victory. With the $75, Francis exchanged his ticket for a later flight and 
went one for three in the Hawks' 21st consecutive league victory.

MOTOROLA HAS A POCKET-SIZE CELLULAR PHONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorola Inc. introduced a dramatically smaller cellular telephone Tuesday that 
can be carried in a purse or coat pocket. 
</P>
<P>
The device, half the size of any other portable cellular model, is about as 
wide and long as a checkbook. It is about as thick as a fat wallet at the 
earpiece while tapering down to half the thickness of a deck of cards at the 
mouthpiece. 
</P>
<P>
The phone has a shorter-than-usual battery life. The 10.7-ounce model has a 
30-minute rechargeable battery, while the 12.3-ounce one has a 75-minute 
battery. It needs no wires or base to operate. 
</P>
<P>
The device, called the Micro Tac Personal Telephone, is expected to retail for 
$2,995 and be available six weeks after being ordered. Motorola officials said 
they were taking orders immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new category of cellular -- the personal cellular," said Jim 
Bernhart, vice president and director of distribution for Motorola's cellular 
subscriber group. "We view it as the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Schaumburg, Ill.-based company would not reveal development 
costs for the new device, but said the company had invested about $350 million 
in development of cellular telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Weisshappel, Motorola vice president and director of the North American 
subscriber division, said the device has the identical range to the company's 
larger, Dynatac portable. 
</P>
<P>
Cellular telephones work as radio transmitters and receivers. Metropolitan 
areas offering cellular service are divided up into sections called cells, with 
each cell containing a receiving-transmitting antenna to connect many calls 
simultaneously with the local phone system. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn., the United States 
has about 2 million cellular subscribers. Nearly 839,000 subscribers were added 
in 1988, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last six months of 1988, cellular service revenue was $1.07 billion, and 
the average monthly cellular phone bill was $98.02, the association said.

QUEBEC PANEL BARS BID FOR BIG BLOCK OF CINEPLEX STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Quebec Securities Commission on Tuesday turned down Cineplex Odeon Chairman 
Garth H. Drabinsky's bid to buy -- with other investors -- a 30% stake in his 
company from the Charles R. Bronfman family. The ruling dealt a serious blow to 
Drabinsky's hopes of seizing control of the movie theater concern without 
making a tender offer to other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
On another front, however, the regulators' decision gave no clue as to how 
several other thorny issues affecting the Toronto company will be resolved. The 
company has been in turmoil ever since its largest shareholder, MCA Inc., told 
a Canadian court last week that MCA and Bronfman representatives on the 
Cineplex board had been "extremely critical" of management's financial 
reporting practices. 
</P>
<P>
The MCA allegation has potentially embarrassed the powerful Bronfman clan as it 
attempted to get out of its Cineplex holdings. The Bronfmans have three 
representatives on Cineplex's 16-member board and, like MCA, have a seat on the 
audit committee. If the sale to Drabinsky collapses, analysts privately ask 
whether the Bronfmans can sell to another group or in the open market if the 
family has inside information of an adverse nature about Cineplex's accounting. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot could be a long battle for control, creating a situation that 
invites a change in management or ownership of the 10-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have even speculated that the Bronfmans and MCA might band 
together to call for Drabinsky's resignation or try to unseat him at Cineplex's 
annual shareholders meeting scheduled next month. But under the terms of its 
standstill agreement with Cineplex, MCA must use its 33% voting stake to fill 
its own five seats on the Cineplex board and has no role in electing the other 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Bronfmans nor Drabinsky provided any clues Tuesday about their next 
actions, but they are expected to meet with other Cineplex directors on 
Thursday at a board meeting that could prove crucial to Cineplex's future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Match Offer 
</P>
<P>
MCA has urged the board to form a committee of independent directors to weigh 
Drabinsky's plan to seize control. Interestingly, in a letter made public at 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, MCA also urged the Cineplex board to 
find out whether other parties might be interested in making a bid for the 
company -- and took pains to express its own lack of interest in acquiring 
control. 
</P>
<P>
If, however, another party makes an "acceptable" bid for Cineplex or any of its 
U.S. movie theaters, MCA appears to have the right, under its standstill 
agreement, to match the offer and acquire the U.S. theaters in question. 
</P>
<P>
The Cineplex board was scheduled to meet last Thursday, but the meeting was 
canceled by Drabinsky, sources said. That same day, MCA Vice President Charles 
S. Paul went into a Canadian court and submitted his affidavit that disclosed 
MCA's criticisms of Cineplex management, winning an injunction against the 
Drabinsky group to prevent its purchase of the Bronfman stake. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex had the injunction set aside early this week, but the Quebec 
Securities Commission ruling has effectively granted MCA's wish to halt the 
deal. MCA won't appeal the ruling that set aside the injunction, said Ian 
Currie, a Toronto attorney who represents MCA. According to Currie, his client 
is now "waiting to see what happens, the ball being in (Drabinsky's) court." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Drabinsky nor Bronfman attorney Michael Vineberg of Montreal returned a 
reporter's phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hayes, a Toronto attorney who is representing Drabinsky, said his client 
is not expected to appeal Tuesday's decision by Quebec regulators. "The QSC 
ruling is fairly clear. As far as I know, our clients are going to abide by 
it," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
In the ruling, the Quebec regulatory agency said it rejected the Drabinsky 
group's request to acquire the Bronfman stake because, in its opinion, it 
"would be detrimental to the protection of investors and to the proper 
functioning of the securities market." The commission also refused to grant an 
alternative proposal put forth by the Drabinsky group that would have allowed 
it to acquire a smaller stake of 5 million shares. The commission ordered the 
group to resubmit any new proposed agreement related to the Bronfman holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex stock closed Tuesday at $13.125 a share, down 25 cents, in composite 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

JAMES FLANIGAN: LACK OF CAPITAL TAKES U.S. OUT OF COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"For want of a nail," wrote Benjamin Franklin, "the shoe was lost." From a 
decision by a medium-sized company in an obscure but crucial business, we can 
draw a lesson and a warning. 
</P>
<P>
Perkin-Elmer Corp., a 50-year-old company in Norwalk, Conn., that gets about 
$200 million of its $1.2 billion in annual revenue from lithographic equipment 
for making semiconductors, announced Friday that it was going to sell that 
business and use the proceeds to repurchase shares or pay extra dividends. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was seen by knowledgeable people as terrible news -- a possible 
body blow to U.S. prospects in electronics and computers and evidence that the 
U.S. financial system is not suited to development of the industries and jobs 
of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what happens when you don't have the savings to provide capital for 
industry," said Robert N. Noyce, founder of Intel Corp. and now chairman of 
Sematech, the government-industry consortium trying to help U.S. companies 
develop advanced semiconductor equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Worldwide Leader 
</P>
<P>
"Perkin-Elmer's decision is one of the most serious blows to the interests of 
the U.S. electronics and computer industries," said Jerry Hutcheson of VLSI 
Research in San Jose. "It shows that our financial system is not conducive to 
financing long-term technological development." 
</P>
<P>
Are such comments overdone? Not really. Perkin-Elmer is a technological leader 
in a worldwide, $8-billion industry that is key to much larger industries. Its 
equipment makes integrated circuits, which in turn govern everything from 
computers to car engines. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies dominated the equipment field 10 years ago, but now Japanese 
companies are in the lead. And the industry is so critical that the U.S. 
government is spending $500 million, matched by $500 million from industry, to 
finance Sematech's effort to keep U.S. companies in the race. 
</P>
<P>
But Sematech can succeed only if there is a vibrant industry. And in that 
respect, Perkin-Elmer was one of the great hopes. Its electron beam and 
template-making equipment is the world standard and its new $4-million machine, 
called Micrascan, is ahead of the field. 
</P>
<P>
No slouch in research, Perkin-Elmer had invested $100 million to develop 
Micrascan, a lithography machine that is getting a good reception from 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Return Expected 
</P>
<P>
Yet Perkin-Elmer, which got into the equipment field 15 years ago when U.S. 
companies were creating the modern microelectronics industry, is weary. It saw 
the game grow riskier as American semiconductor makers dropped out under the 
assault of Japanese competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The only return we could see on that $100 million Micrascan investment was 
break even at best," says Perkin-Elmer President Gaynor Kelley, "and if we went 
on to the next generation in equipment (superpowered X-rays), the research 
expense would take away from other business (analytical instruments for the 
chemical industry) where we see a higher return." 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, 57, a mechanical engineer who has been with the company 37 years, 
blames the semiconductor equipment business for Perkin-Elmer's lagging profits 
and stock price, which drew complaints from Wall Street's institutional 
investors. "You can only expect an investor to be patient for so long," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. Japanese companies face the same research costs -- but not the same 
investor pressures. Their secret is that small companies are supported by large 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Nikon, where semiconductor equipment sales now exceed camera sales, is a member 
of the Mitsubishi Group, an agglomeration of 42 companies that may be the 
world's largest business organization. Advantest, another equipment leader, is 
21% owned by Fujitsu. The focus is on winning markets. "In memory chips, the 
Japanese companies lost $4 billion," says Noyce. "The U.S. industry blew $2 
billion and quit the field." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, U.S. companies need protectors, too, but who would buy Perkin-Elmer's 
operation? "The Japanese would love to buy it," says Hutcheson of VLSI "but 
that would be disastrous for U.S. industry." 
</P>
<P>
He mentions Applied Materials, a U.S. equipment maker, or Motorola, which is 
resuming memory chip production, as possible American buyers. The deal makes 
sense economically, Hutcheson says, because a lot of semiconductor plants are 
being built worldwide, which means big demands for equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The catch is that an American buyer would have to be able to sell in Japan. 
And, says Noyce, "Japan doesn't buy unless their companies absolutely don't 
make it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not the heart of the problem," he adds. Not buying U.S. goods, 
"that's their fault," says Noyce. But low personal savings and government 
deficits that make capital scarce and costly to U.S. industry, "that's our 
fault," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't blame Wall Street; it's only the go-between, channeling funds 
around a society that gives tax breaks to vacation homes but not to investment 
in industry," says Noyce, recalling and repeating the classic line from the 
comic strip Pogo: "We have met the enemy and he is us."

AFTERMATH OF A SCANDAL; 
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE COMPANY'S STORY REFLECTS TIES BETWEEN BUSINESS, POLITICAL PRACTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
By American standards, Hiromasa Ezoe would have been considered a success 
story. But by Japanese standards, and his own, his successes weren't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Ezoe, born in a lower-class background in class-conscious Japan, founded 
Recruit Co. with an initial investment of $1,400 in 1960, while still in his 
20s. Starting out by simply publishing a single news sheet that advertised jobs 
for students, the company grew enormously under his direction until more than 
25 years later it had become a giant information, computer and real estate 
conglomerate with annual sales of close to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But in Japan, guiding a fast-growing young business isn't sufficient to win 
influence and acceptance in that nation's tight inner circle of high-ranking 
government and business decision-makers. Ezoe has been charged with secretly 
lavishing such leaders with gifts and low-priced stock, winning himself 
appointments to several government advisory boards. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosures of these influence-buying arrangements have resulted in the biggest 
political scandal to hit Japan since former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was 
convicted in 1983 on charges of taking bribes from Lockheed Corp. in the early 
1970s. Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's announcement this week that he would 
resign made him the latest in a series of top officials -- including three 
Cabinet members -- to step down in disgrace. Ezoe earlier had resigned as 
Recruit chairman, facing multiple charges of bribery. A dozen others have been 
arrested and charged, including a prominent Japanese businessman and two former 
vice ministers. 
</P>
<P>
The Recruit scandal is not just a rags-to-riches story of an ambitious Japanese 
entrepreneur whose lust for influence brought down an entire administration. It 
is a dramatic illustration of the tight relations between government and 
business in Japan, and how politicians depend on businesses to provide money 
and assets to fuel that nation's expensive political system. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal is remarkable not so much because influence buying was attempted. 
Indeed, such practices are widespread and tolerated. But, rather, it is because 
the alleged bribes were done on such a large scale, with so many high-ranking 
officials, and were exposed so widely by a Japanese print and broadcast media 
that has let previous instances go by largely unreported. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is that this caused such a fuss . . . because it is standard 
operating procedure," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., senior associate at the 
Carnegie Endowment in Washington and former counselor for Japan affairs at the 
Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It is generally accepted knowledge in Japan by Japanese and American scholars 
that Japanese politicians receive monies in ways that would be unacceptable in 
American politics," said Richard L. Drobnick, director of USC's International 
Business Education and Research Program. 
</P>
<P>
Influence buying of the type practiced by Recruit is commonplace, experts say, 
in part because gift giving -- with the hope of receiving future good will and 
possible favors in return -- is ingrained into Japanese traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Also, industrial policy is highly centralized, with businesses requiring a 
great deal of guidance from government officials on industrial policy and 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"To expand your business activities in Japan, it's important to work closely 
with government officials much more so than in the United States," said Saburo 
Oto, audit partner in the Japanese practice of the accounting firm of Touche 
Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Funding from businesses also is considered necessary for politicians to 
operate. Japanese elected officials, unlike their American counterparts, are 
expected to raise money not only to finance campaigns and support other 
politicians, but also to pay their staffs, run their office and entertain 
constituents and others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costly Customs 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japanese politicians also are expected to attend and bring gifts 
to numerous weddings, funerals and other activities of constituents in their 
home districts, the result of much tighter relationships than American 
politicians are accustomed to, said Jack Lewis, an associate professor of 
international business at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very costly compared to what is done in the United States," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
A law enacted after the Tanaka-Lockheed scandal that set limits on corporate 
contributions forced the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to reach beyond 
established companies to new firms like Recruit for contributions. 
</P>
<P>
And with tight relations forged between established business and government 
leaders, breaking into such inner circles is tough for young up-and-coming 
business leaders. It is made even tougher because one party, the LDP, still 
dominates Japanese politics, and leaders of its various factions form a clubby 
inner circle of Japan's leading decision makers. Couple that with the 
industrial dominance of a few giant, decades-old conglomerates and trading 
companies like Mitsubishi, Sony, Toyota and Mitsui. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, they have strong ideas about who's on the inside and who's on the 
outside," Lewis said. "If you are on the outside, like (Recruit founder) Ezoe, 
you don't have much of a chance" unless you buy your way in with gifts. 
</P>
<P>
That is what Ezoe is accused of trying to do. Recruit's diversification into 
information services, computer leasing and real estate investment gained him a 
high profile in Tokyo's business establishment. But he still lacked important 
government contacts and influence that would help him rise further. 
</P>
<P>
Some Japan experts say Recruit's actions may have gone by unnoticed and 
tolerated had it not been done on such a large scale -- and had politicians not 
initially tried to cover it up by denying involvement. An aide to Takeshita, 
for example, had received a $381,000 loan from Recruit that, while not illegal 
in Japan, damaged Takeshita's political standing because he failed to mention 
it when explaining his involvement with Recruit before parliament earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Profits for Many 
</P>
<P>
All in all, about 150 politicians, bureaucrats and business leaders are 
believed to have bought directly or indirectly discounted shares in Recruit 
Cosmos, a property subsidiary, between 1984 and 1986. The company sold its 
stock to the public in October, 1986, generating huge profits of as much as 
twice what recipients paid. 
</P>
<P>
Ezoe also gave Recruit Cosmos shares to prominent businessmen like Hisashi 
Shinto, chairman of Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone, the world's largest 
company. Ezoe hoped that Shinto would help Recruit enter lucrative computer and 
telecommunications businesses. NTT subsequently helped Recruit obtain two giant 
supercomputers from an American company, Cray Research. 
</P>
<P>
"The rise of the company was so spectacular, and the amount of money thrown 
around so great, it was the Japanese equivalent of the Michael Milken case in 
the United States," said Frank Gibney, president of the Pacific Basin 
Institute, a Santa Barbara think tank, noting the case of the American "junk 
bond" king recently indicted for securities violations. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Recruit) exceeded the norm, it was just too flagrant," Gibney said. 
</P>
<P>
NTT's Shinto resigned last year. Prosecutors charged him in February with 
taking a bribe in connection with about $80,000 in stock received from Recruit. 
</P>
<P>
First details about the Recruit scandal were revealed last July by Asahi 
Shimbun, a leading Japanese newspaper often critical of the government. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal soon became a television spectacle, capped by the remarkable 
instance of Hiroshi Matsubara, an aide to Recruit Chairman Ezoe, being 
videotaped trying to bribe an opposition member of the Diet, Japan's 
parliament, with cash so that he would not ask too many questions in an 
investigation. The videotape was shown on national television. 
</P>
<P>
"The energy with which the media went after Recruit is possible because it is 
an outsider," said Gerald L. Curtis, director of the East Asian Institute at 
Columbia University. "It's hard to imagine that a mainstream Sumitomo or 
Mitsubishi would get that attention." 
</P>
<P>
News of the influence buying enraged some Japanese already dissatisfied with 
the government in general and Takeshita in particular, whose popularity ratings 
have plummeted to less than 5% in part because of his support of an unpopular 
3% consumption tax. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese workers also are harboring growing resentments about how so little of 
Japan's growing international wealth has trickled down to the average worker, 
who still cannot afford to buy his own home or apartment. Thus they resented 
top government and business leaders using their influence to profit on stock 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of a consumers' revolt, it just took a different form," said 
Gibney of the Pacific Basin Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the scandal will result in significant reforms remains to be seen, but 
some experts are pessimistic that the system of influence peddling will die 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
"For there to be change, there will have to be a way to finance Japanese 
politics that is not dependent on big business," said former Commerce official 
Prestowitz. Also, he said, there may have to be changes in such things as the 
tradition of politicians attending weddings and funerals, and of the close 
relationship between business and government. 
</P>
<P>
Such changes, he said, are so fundamental that they are unlikely in the near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Steinhoff, director of the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of 
Hawaii, said she expects big Japanese companies will be even more careful in 
how they make political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"The older and more established companies are sort of snickering that this 
upstart company was so crude it got caught," Steinhoff said. "It will add to 
the finesse of how big companies give money."

Treasury Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.66%, up from 8.57% last 
week. Another $7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 8.72%, up from 8.59% last week. The rates were the highest 
since April 10, when three-month bills sold for 8.71% and six-month bills 
averaged 8.78%. The new discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors -- 8.98% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,781.10 and 9.25% for a six-month bill selling for $9,559.20. The discount 
rate reflects the price discount received when government securities are 
purchased at less than face value.

ENERGY FUTURES PRICES JUMP IN HEAVY TRADING

Energy futures prices surged in brisk trading Tuesday, with gasoline leading 
the pack amid continued concerns about supplies. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for wholesale unleaded 
gasoline jumped 3.93 cents to settle at 76.16 cents a gallon, after dropping 
1.93 cents on Monday. Other contract months were up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of 
crude oil, closed on the exchange at $21.41 a 42-gallon barrel, up 80 cents 
from Monday, when it fell 71 cents. 
</P>
<P>
May wholesale heating oil, which slid 1.82 cents in the previous session, 
gained 0.27 cent to settle at 52.08 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lebow, a senior trader with ED&amp;F Man International Futures Inc., 
attributed the gasoline rally partly to expectations that the latest American 
Petroleum Institute weekly report would show decreased supplies in the wake of 
the Exxon oil tanker spill in Valdez, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
An explosion in the North Sea last week also compounded fears of an already 
tight gasoline supply situation as the summer driving season approaches. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Exxon Corp. and Shell U.K., the British unit of Royal Dutch Shell 
Group, said they expected a prolonged shutdown in production in that area. 
</P>
<P>
The North Sea accident has disrupted the flow of Brent crude through a major 
pipeline, affecting the production of at least 500,000 barrels a day.

Marvin Davis Loses a Round: A Delaware Chancery Court judge denied, for now, a 
request by Marvin Davis for an injunction on NWA Inc.'s "poison pill" 
anti-takeover defense. But Chancellor William P. Allen said Davis could return 
to court after NWA's annual meeting May 15. Davis contended that a provision of 
the poison pill would make it hard for a Davis-backed board of directors to 
sell the company. Davis is trying to unseat the board of NWA, the parent of 
Northwest Airlines, and has made a hostile $2.7-billion bid for the company.

SAN DIEGO EARNINGS: GREAT AMERICAN CROWS DESPITE DROP IN PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Great American First Savings Bank reported a first-quarter profit of $11.1 
million, down from $14.3 million for the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, Great American executives at Tuesday's annual shareholders 
meeting hailed the results as evidence that the S&amp;L's core earnings, or 
those from lending activities and real estate income, are improving and that 
asset quality is on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Of this year's profit, about 85% flowed from core earnings, whereas last year 
Great American lost money on its lending activities. Last year's first-quarter 
profit was made possible only by $32.5 million in gains from investment 
transactions and the sale of packaged mortgage loans. This year those gains 
added up to less than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's core earnings were stunted last year by problems connected 
with the S&amp;L's commercial loan portfolio in Arizona, which was inherited 
when it acquired Home Federal Savings of Tucson. Great American ended up taking 
$154 million in loan-loss provisions last year, which amount to charges on 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
For example, during the first quarter of last year, Great American set aside 
$22.2 million for probable loan and interest losses. Its loss provisions in the 
current year's first quarter dropped to $7.6 million, according to chief 
financial officer Jim Krzeminski. 
</P>
<P>
Great American has now reduced its non-performing loans and foreclosures to 
$389 million, or 2.3% of its $16.4 billion in assets. That is a significant 
improvement from this time last year, when bad loans were $556 million, or 
3.68% of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Although Great American's bad loans are still above the 2%-of-assets benchmark 
characteristic of healthy thrifts, analysts commended the S&amp;L for facing 
the bad loans head-on. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a trend of improvement," said David Hochstim, a thrift 
industry analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. "The strategy was to 
get all (the bad loans) behind them and go forward. When you have 
non-performing loans at the high levels they had, they become a real drag on 
earnings, and the best thing is to get them off the books." 
</P>
<P>
Great American's interest rate "spread," or difference between what it collects 
in interest on its loans and other assets and what it pays out on liabilities 
such as deposits, was 1.87% of assets during the quarter. That is less than the 
2.5%-or-higher spread of several top-performing S&amp;Ls, but is noteworthy in 
that Great American was able to keep it from eroding further in the environment 
of rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Great American's spread is low relative to their competitors, but it only 
dropped 10 basis points (0.10%) from Dec. 31, while most S&amp;Ls saw their 
spread decline by 30 to 40 basis points," said Gary Gordon, a stock analyst 
with PaineWebber of New York. "Borrowing costs over the first quarter were 
rising much faster than S&amp;Ls' variable-rate loans could adjust for." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Harting, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York, said Great American's 
reduced provision for loan losses demonstrates confidence for the coming year: 
"Most S&amp;Ls won't try to 'front load' earnings in the first quarter by 
taking too low a (loan loss) provision. They prefer to show a stair-step 
increase in earnings through the year." 
</P>
<P>
Despite improvements in some areas, Great American Chairman Gordon Luce said in 
an interview that he is still cautious about the Arizona portfolio and the 
effect rising interest rates could have on the loans there and elsewhere in the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they're completely out of the woods yet, but I think it's fair 
to say they are starting to see their way out of the woods," PaineWebber's 
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Krzeminski said Great American's assets will grow only 5% this year and that 
1989 loan originations will drop to $4.3 billion in 1989 from $5.6 billion last 
year. The reduction is due mainly to the softer secondary market for loans 
because of uncertainty surrounding future interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Deposits as of March 31 totaled $11.3 billion, up from $10.9 billion a year 
ago. Loans were $11.6 billion, up from $10 billion a year ago, and assets of 
$16.4 billion were up from $15.2 billion. Great American is the eighth-largest 
publicly held S&amp;L.

TIMES MIRROR PROFIT DIPS IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times Mirror Co. said Tuesday that its first-quarter profit declined 8% to 
$68.8 million but noted that the year-ago profit included a gain from the sale 
of assets. Excluding that one-time gain and interest expenses, the company said 
its pretax operating profit rose 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror, which publishes the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, the Baltimore Sun 
and other newspapers, said operating profit rose to $129.6 million in part 
because of substantially increased earnings from its newspaper publishing and 
cable television operations. Revenue rose 9% to $846.9 million, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ongoing cost containment efforts are contributing to improvements in our 
operations," said Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive. "However, we 
are continuing to experience some softness in advertising in certain markets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Softening New York Economy 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper publishing benefited from increases in advertising, lower costs and 
five additional days in the period, the company said. The Los Angeles Times and 
Baltimore Sun led the newspaper group with strong results, the company said, 
but Newsday's advertising volume was weak, primarily because of a softening 
economy in New York. The newspaper sector reported operating profits of $90.1 
million, a 20% gain. Revenue rose to $521.9 million from $471.1 million in the 
year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate announcement, Times Mirror said the newspaper group's advertising 
revenue rose 10.5% to $422.3 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The cable television operations showed the greatest improvement in the quarter, 
the company said. Operating profit rose nearly 58% to $14 million on a 17% 
increase in revenue. Times Mirror cited an increase in subscribers, higher 
rates and lower costs as among the reasons for the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings in the company's broadcast television and book and magazine publishing 
sectors declined. However, the company said its professional publishing sector, 
including the Matthew Bender and Jeppesen Sanderson companies, showed strong 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcast revenue declined slightly, but operating profits dropped 14% to $7.3 
million. Times Mirror said less demand for advertising and a depressed Texas 
economy continued to affect the broadcast group, although the flagship station 
in Dallas, KDFW-TV, showed some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Book, magazine and other publishing revenue rose 9%, but operating profit 
declined nearly 21%.

FHP PROFIT JUMPS 28% IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As some health maintenance organizations flounder, FHP International Corp. 
reported Tuesday that its earnings jumped 28% to $5.3 million for its fiscal 
1989 third quarter. Revenue for the quarter, which ended March 31, increased 
38% to $186.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley-based HMO said its performance was boosted by a 24% 
increase in membership, which grew to 446,000 enrollees March 31, contrasted 
with 360,000 a year ago. And the company benefited from rate increases in its 
commercial and senior plans, Chairman Robert Gumbiner said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 9 months of fiscal 1989, earnings were ahead 38% to $14.4 
million, contrasted with $10.4 million. Revenue was $499.7 million, up 39% from 
$358.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
FHP reported its increased profits amid a stream of losses from some other 
for-profit HMO's, including Maxicare in Los Angeles, Cigna Health Plans of 
California in Glendale and Greater San Diego Health Plan in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress-based PacifiCare has remained profitable, and analysts expect it to 
post an earnings increase for its fiscal 1989 second quarter, which ended March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
Health care analysts said FHP continues to do well because of strategic steps 
taken by its management, which still follows the careful, moderate-growth 
strategy that influenced the company's operations when FHP operated as a 
nonprofit operation before 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"FHP and PacifiCare operate as regional and local businesses. They did not do 
what Maxicare did and overexpand," said Peter Grua, a health care analyst at 
Alex Brown &amp; Co., a brokerage firm in Baltimore. FHP operates in 
California, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
By growing slowly, FHP has been able to pay for its medical centers soon after 
opening them. Because many of its facilities are paid for, FHP has a 
competitive advantage over recently formed HMOs that must make large interest 
payments on newly built centers, said Lee Grover, a principal in Wm. Mercer 
Meidinger Hansen, an employee benefits consulting firm in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
FHP stock, which was up on Monday, fell $1 per share Tuesday to $24 in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
To capitalize on a stock price that has recently traded at record-high levels, 
FHP plans a public offering of 2 million shares. The offering could come as 
early as mid-May, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
At FHP's recent trading price of $24, the company could raise $48 million, 
which Grua said should help the company reduce its debt. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 2 years ago, when FHP stock was trading at 25% of its current level, 
the company benefited by repurchasing 2.5 million shares, some for as little as 
$5.75 per share. 
</P>
<P>

FHP INTERNATIONAL CORP. AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
FHP International Corp. is a Fountain Valley-based health maintenance 
organization with 446,000 members in California, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. 
Primarily, FHP operates a staff-model HMO, in which it hires most of the 
doctors and staff it needs and owns most of its own medical facilities. 
Chairman Robert Gumbiner started the HMO in 1961 as a nonprofit corporation, 
and in 1985 he led an 18-member employee group that acquired the operation 
after it had been converted into a for-profit concern. In 1986, the new owners 
took the company public.

Rising crude oil prices cut refining and marketing profits sharply in the first 
quarter, pushing earnings down at the nation's major oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mobil Corp., the nation's second-largest oil company, reported a 
22% decline, No.3 Chevron Corp. said its profit fell 52% and No. 4 Texaco 
Inc.'s results would have been flat if not for a major asset sale. 
</P>
<P>
However, oil company officials were optimistic that rising worldwide demand for 
gasoline would boost the industry in the second quarter and for the remainder 
of the year.

Steel Firms: USX Corp.'s profits shot up 88% while Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s 
profits fell 24%, the nation's biggest and second-biggest steelmakers said in 
first-quarter reports. Pittsburgh-based USX said its net income surged to $296 
million, led by a near threefold increase in operating income at Marathon Oil 
Co. Operating income from steel sagged 40% to $99 million on sales of $1.5 
billion. Overall sales grew by 12.5% to $4.5 billion. Marathon contributed 
operating income of $241 million on $2.4 billion in first-quarter sales. Sales 
rose 5.6% to $1.4 billion. The Bethlehem, Pa.-based No. 2 steelmaker said it 
charged $55 million against the quarter as the cost of reorganizing its 
troubled Baltimore marine division. The 1988 results included a charge of $19 
million over a coal mine fire and employee benefits and a $10-million credit as 
an investment tax credit refund.

WAGES ROSE 4.2% IN PAST 12 MONTHS, U.S. REPORTS

<P>
Wages and salaries in the private sector, a closely watched barometer of 
inflation, rose a modest 4.2% in the latest 12 months, the Labor Department 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Among those with the heftiest increase were such service areas as health care, 
wholesale trade, finance, insurance and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The increase for the 12 months that ended in March was the largest in 3 1/2 
years, but went up only slightly from a gain of 4.1% in January-December, 1988, 
according to the employment cost index, which is issued quarterly. Wages and 
salaries rose 3.3% in the 12 months that preceded March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The report may provide assurance to the Federal Reserve Board, which has been 
raising short-term interest rates for the past year to combat inflation. The 
Fed is concerned that once wages respond decisively to higher prices, inflation 
becomes rooted in the economy and is more difficult to control. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation until recent months had been widely considered to be proceeding at 
only a moderate pace, compared to the high inflation years of 1979 and 1980. 
But both the consumer price index and the producer price index have been moving 
noticeably higher in 1989 in large part because of a climb in energy and food 
costs.

American Home Shield Corp., a home warranty company, said Monday it had agreed 
to be bought by ServiceMaster LP, a leading building maintenance services 
company, in a deal worth up to $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
ServiceMaster, of Downers Grove, Ill., said it had signed a definitive merger 
agreement to buy 80% of American Home Shield's shares for $9.50 a share, plus 
up to $3.50 a share depending on the company's performance through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Senior officers of American Home Shield would own the remaining 20% of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The merger agreement calls for American Home Shield to pay ServiceMaster $2.5 
million if its board changes its mind and recommends another offer.

New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the joint venture between Toyota and 
General Motors, said Tuesday that it will expand operations by producing Toyota 
pickup trucks. The joint venture, which dates to 1983, has limited its 
production to cars, but the operation has been losing money. Plans call for 
producing 100,000 Toyota trucks a year at the Fremont plant starting in the 
spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The decision had been long anticipated by industry observers, who expected 
Toyota to find a U.S. manufacturing site for trucks soon, partially to avoid a 
25% tariff on imported trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which is subject to governmental approval, will add about 700 new 
jobs at NUMMI and calls for an investment of more than $200 million to the 
Fremont plant, the company said.

AN EXQUISITE EVENING OF FOLK-ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Among the inescapable conclusions drawn from Fairport Convention's show Monday 
at the Roxy: You can't keep a good band down. 
</P>
<P>
Over its 20-year career, the seminal English folk-rock group has experienced a 
potentially crippling number of lineup changes (it would take a ream of paper 
to chart the Fairport family tree) and uneven -- though mostly limited -- 
commercial success, especially in this country. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore the generally low-profile and long, labyrinthine history of 
the band (which plays the Coach House in San Capistrano tonight and Bogart's in 
Long Beach on Thursday), singer-guitarist Simon Nicol introduced Monday's 
opening number, "Reynard the Fox," by saying "We're about to do a Fairport 
Convention number, whoever they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, let's just say Michael Jackson has never been looking over his shoulder 
to see if a Fairport LP might pass him on the charts. In its 2-hour Roxy show, 
though, the quintet did take every opportunity to plug its current release, 
"Red and Gold," executing a very thorough job of record promotion that in the 
hands of a less charming or humorous outfit would have been shameless 
hucksterism. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it helped a lot that the selections from that oft-mentioned album 
were uniformly strong, whether they were soaring instrumentals written by the 
band or songs penned by such stalwarts as Ralph McTell . . . or band 
arrangements of traditional instrumentals or songs composed by Fairport members 
-- well, you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the group covered considerable -- and considerably wonderful -- 
ground when not performing (or plugging) the new material, from Nicol's gentle 
and gorgeous "The Deserter" to the fiery, foot-stomping, set-closing medley of, 
as guitarist Martin Allcock put it, "Celtic dance tune-type things." 
</P>
<P>
Because Richard Thompson joined Crowded House on stage both nights of its 
recent Los Angeles stand, one certainly expected the ex-Fairport fret-maestro 
to turn up at this show. Sure enough, Thompson -- and another former Fairport 
guitarist, Jerry Donahue -- jumped into the fray for a rip-roaring 
double-encore to cap an exquisite, exhilarating evening. 
</P>
<P>
This would have been a nearly impossible act to follow, but it apparently also 
was a difficult act to precede, judging by Danny Phillips opening segment. 
Accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, Phillips performed a handful of songs 
notable -- if that's the right word -- for their uninteresting melodies and 
uninteresting lyrics ("Why can't you see something's gonna change," "Waves are 
crashing," etc.) Strictly Dullsville.

MUSIC AND DANCE: HINES DOESN'T SIDESTEP UCI STUDENTS' QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can't say that film star and tap artist Gregory Hines didn't ask for it 
when he dropped in on dance students for an informal question-and-answer 
session Monday at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to ask me anything, no matter what it is," Hines told about 150 
students sitting on the floor of Dance Studio 128. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later, Hines, who appeared without fee, was still answering 
questions, ranging from his age (43), to his film work with Mikhail Baryshnikov 
in "White Nights," from his wife and children to career advice. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a gray T-shirt and loose-fitting black pants, Hines answered every 
question without hesitation, with directness and modesty, leavening many 
answers with humor. 
</P>
<P>
His muscled biceps prompted a question of whether he lifts weights. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he answered, saying that he began pumping iron in 1986 when he was 
making the film "Running Scared" with Billy Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy had read the script and found out that we had to take our shirts off on 
page 80," Hines said. "(Immediately) he got a trainer." 
</P>
<P>
Because they were supposed to play "really close friends," Hines started 
hanging around with Crystal. "But every day he went to the gym. So I started 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Hines also began lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it. I gained 15 pounds. My wife said she really liked the added 
weight," he said with a bit of sly innuendo that popped up frequently during 
his session. 
</P>
<P>
Hines called working with Baryshnikov and choreographer Twyla Tharp on "White 
Nights" "one of the most enjoyable experiences I had." 
</P>
<P>
"They dance every day," he said with admiration, since he doesn't. "Up to that 
time, I thought anyone can do modern dance. I was wrong. I would sit and watch 
(Tharp) for an hour. She would do amazing combinations -- and remember them." 
</P>
<P>
Hines, of course, created his own amazing dance combinations -- his tap style 
has been called innovative and muscular -- even before he achieved a new level 
of national prominence by appearing in the Broadway company of "Eubie" in 1978 
and starring with Judith Jamison in the musical "Sophisticated Ladies" in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
His film career has included "Wolfen" (with Albert Finney) and the Mel Brooks 
comedy "History of the World -- Part 1," both in 1981, Francis Ford Coppola's 
"The Cotton Club," in 1986, and last year's "Tap." 
</P>
<P>
Of his own approach to tap, Hines said: "I (am) an improviser. That's my theme 
-- make it up as I go along. I dance, but not every day. I like to have a 
ragged edge. I don't like to be very clean." 
</P>
<P>
Hines is even willing to let people see his mistakes, and pointed to one such 
sequence in "White Nights." 
</P>
<P>
"We shot it three times," he said. "The first time, it was right on a dime. The 
second time, I came out of a spin a little off . . . lost balance a little. I 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
"The character was not taking class every day. He's not sharp. He's not clean." 
</P>
<P>
But Baryshnikov was horrified, Hines said. "He said, 'You're going to let this 
go on the video?' " 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that is the version in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"My style is something I've fought to keep," he added. "I want to be as 
naturalistic as I can be." 
</P>
<P>
Hines credits Henry Le Tang, one of the country's top tap teachers and 
choreographers, as his inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry was my first real teacher," he said. "He was very charismatic. I 
idolized him." 
</P>
<P>
The traditional way to teach tap, Hines said, was to break down the steps and 
learn to count them. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry's way was very different," he said. "You learned an act, a routine. He 
would take us by the hand and do the steps the first time, sing the steps. We 
would do the steps with him. It was so easy, so natural. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing with any art is in the doing. Try to get around people doing it. 
. . . Get around tap dancers -- and steal steps. Stealing steps is crucial." 
</P>
<P>
Although the comment drew a laugh from the audience, Hines was serious: "You 
only need one step. One step a week, and at the end of a year. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to steals steps is by hearing it and singing it. To this day, I 
steal steps from anybody. . . . Ultimately, the steps become my own. You change 
the shape of it. It's a great thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Hines knows that his life as a dancer is limited and is expanding his film work 
as an alternative career. but he also sees family life as critical. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I have 5 years at this level. Then I would have to stop or change my 
style of tap. The life of a dancer doesn't last very long. I enjoy dancing, but 
I also enjoy family and the life that implies." 
</P>
<P>
Although he said a love scene in "Tap" bothered his wife a little, he said it 
made an important statement for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks very rarely get to see ourselves in those situations -- a love scene 
that is tasteful and passionate." 
</P>
<P>
College, he said, "is the greatest opportunity you have to expand yourself. The 
longer you can wait before committing yourself, the better. I regret not doing 
more jazz class, more ballet." 
</P>
<P>
Hines advised the young dancers to gain as much experience as they can and 
suggested that they learn some business skills if they are serious about a 
professional career. 
</P>
<P>
"Business people have very little regard for actors," he said. "From a business 
point of view, I really had a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
He told the students to "believe in your talent" and prepare to be aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to wait for something, but go after it," he said. "I got very 
aggressive, like right up to the point of being obnoxious. . . . A lot of 
times, that didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
So why did he persevere? Was it, as one student asked, because he always had 
visions of being a star? 
</P>
<P>
"No, not being a star," he said. "What I really wanted was to get the job."

L.A. 12TH-GRADERS' TEST SCORES MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelfth-graders in the Los Angeles Unified School District scored slightly 
lower in reading and slightly higher in mathematics this year, mirroring 
statewide trends, results of the 1988-89 California Assessment Program test 
show. 
</P>
<P>
In both academic areas, Los Angeles district seniors on average performed below 
most 12th-graders statewide. The district's average math score rose one point 
to 209, while the average reading score dropped two points to 200. 
</P>
<P>
Scores varied widely among individual schools in the district. Among regular 
high schools, University had the highest scores, with 260 in reading and 277 in 
math. 
</P>
<P>
Other district schools that scored well below the state average still managed 
to show gains. For instance, Franklin in Highland Park rose 12 points in 
reading to 171 and 14 points in math to 182. Principal Edward Rosas attributed 
the improvement in reading chiefly to a new effort to incorporate literature 
into the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
At Fremont High School in South-Central Los Angeles, where the reading score 
rose 16 points to 136 and the math score eight points to 143, school officials 
cited several factors, including better staff coordination, greater efforts to 
familiarize students with the format of the test and prizes given to home rooms 
with the highest number of students taking the exam. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the average score rose six points to 256 in mathematics but dropped 
two points to 248 in reading. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig offered an upbeat appraisal of the 
state's scores, saying that although some of this year's results are 
disappointing, "The long-term trend is more impressive." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Honig said, an analysis of test results show that the average 
12th-grade student today is performing nearly a full grade level higher in math 
and half a grade level higher in reading than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the fastest spurt of growth in this state ever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide decline in reading scores occurred mainly among girls, whose 
average score fell six points to 251. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand it," Honig said of the reading slump among girls. "I don't 
know if it's an anomaly or if this particular class is different or if 
something we're doing is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
A recent College Board study showed a narrowing of the gender gap over the last 
20 years on tests of verbal ability, and Honig said, "This could be part of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, women have scored significantly higher than men on tests of 
language skill. But the College Board study found that women's verbal scores 
have been falling and men's scores rising on such tests as the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test (SAT), the American College Testing Program Examination (ACT) and 
advanced placement exams. 
</P>
<P>
Among California's 12th-grade boys, reading test results showed a one-point 
gain to an average of 245. 
</P>
<P>
Improvement in math was found across the board, with gains made by male and 
female students and all major ethnic groups, Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat McCabe, a California Assessment Program consultant for the state Department 
of Education, noted that the number of limited-English-speaking students rose 
1% statewide to 6.3% in 1988-89. But those students as a group scored 12 points 
higher in math and one point higher in reading than did last year's 
limited-English group, McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Limited-English students still performed considerably lower than most students 
statewide, however, with an average reading score of 132 and average math score 
of 187. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, 95% of all 12th-graders, or 226,000 students, took the California 
Assessment Program test last December, 2% more than in 1987-88. 
</P>

<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
* Districts are in boldface (first entry in each table); individual schools are 
in light face. Two years of test results are given. The first line of numbers 
contains 1988-89 test results, while the second line refers to 1987-88 results. 
Scores for magnet programs, continuation schools and other schools with small 
enrollments have been omitted. 
</P>
<P>
* The scores are reported on a scale from 100 to about 400. The average score 
statewide in 1988-89 was 248 in reading and 256 in math. 
</P>
<P>
* The "rank" that follows each score allows comparisons to all other districts 
or schools statewide. All schools and districts are ranked on a scale of 1 to 
99 with a median rank of 50. Thus, for example, the Los Angeles County High 
School for the Arts has a rank of 98 in reading and 78 in math, which means it 
scored considerably higher than other high schools in the state in both areas. 
</P>
<P>
* "SES" is a measure of a school's or a district's socioeconomic status. It is 
based on student reports of parents' education level. Each school and district 
is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating parents who did not 
complete high school and 5 indicating those with advanced degrees. A 3 would 
mean that most parents in the school or district attended some college. 
</P>
<P>
* "% LEP" is the percentage of students who are limited-English proficient, 
which means they are not native English speakers and are not yet fluent in 
English. The average California school has 6.3% LEP students. 
</P>
<P>
* In some districts in which only one school is listed, the district and school 
averages may be different. The reason is that the district average included the 
scores of a large number of continuation school students.

Sample Reading Questions 
</P>
<P>
Read the following autobiographical selection by Ernesto Galarza, and then 
answer the questions that follow it. You may look back at the passage as you 
answer the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyhood in a Sacramento Barrio 
</P>
<P>
Our family conversations always occurred on our own kitchen porch, away from 
the gringos. One or the other of the adults would begin: ?Se han fijado? Had we 
noticed -- that the Americans do not ask permission to leave the room; that 
they had no respectful way of addressing an elderly person; that they spit 
brown over the railing of the porch into the yard; that when they laughed they 
roared; that they never brought saludos to everyone in your family from 
everyone in their family when they visited; that General Delibree was only a 
clerk; that zopilotes were not allowed on the streets to collect garbage; that 
the policemen did not carry lanterns at night; that Americans didn't keep their 
feet on the floor when they were sitting; that there was a special automobile 
for going to jail; that a rancho was not a rancho at all but a very small 
hacienda; that the saloons served their customers free eggs, pickles, and 
sandwiches; that instead of bullfighting, the gringos for sport tried to kill 
each other with gloves? 
</P>
<P>
I did not have nearly the strong feelings on these matters that Dona Henriqueta 
expressed. I felt a vague admiration for the way Mr. Brien could spit brown. 
Wayne, my classmate, laughed much better than the Mexicans,because he opened 
his big mouth wide and brayed like a donkey so he could be heard a block away. 
But it was the kind of laughter that made my mother tremble, and it was not 
permitted in our house. 
</P>
<P>
Rules were laid down to keep me, as far as possible, un muchacho bien educado. 
If I had to spit, I was to do it privately, or if in public, by the curb, with 
my head down and my back to people. I was never to wear my cap in the house and 
I was to take it off even on the porch if ladies or elderly gentlemen were 
sitting. If I wanted to scratch, under no circumstances was I to do it right 
then and there, in company, like the Americans, but I was to excuse myself. If 
Catfish or Russell yelled to me from across the street, I was not to shout 
back. I was never to ask for tips for my errands or other services to the 
tenants of 418L, for these were atenciones expected of me. 
</P>
<P>
Above all I was never to fail in respeto to grownups, no matter who they were. 
It was an inflexible rule; I addressed myself to Senor Big Singh, Senor Big 
Ernie, Senora Dodson, Senor Choree Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
We could have hung on the door of our apartment a sign like those we read in 
some store windows -- Aqui se habla espanol. We not only spoke Spanish, we read 
it. From the Libreria Espanola, two blocks up the street, Gustavo and I brought 
novels for my mother, like Genoveva de Brabante, a paperback with the poems of 
Amado Nervo and a handbook of the history of Mexico. The novels were never read 
aloud; the poems and the handbook were. Nervo was the famous poet from Tepic, 
close enough to Jalcocotan to make him our own. And in the history book I 
learned to read for myself, after many repetitions by my mother, about the 
deeds of the great Mexicans Don Salvador had recited so vividly to the class in 
Mazatlan. She refused to decide for me whether Abraham Lincoln was as great as 
Benito Juarez, or George Washington braver than the priest Don Miguel Hidalgo. 
At school there was no opportunity to settle these questions because nobody 
seemed to know about Juarez or Hidalgo; at least they were never mentioned and 
there were no pictures of them on the walls.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abortion opponents, backed by the Bush Administration, today urged the Supreme 
Court to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling giving women the right to terminate 
their pregnancies. The showdown spilled into the streets, where more than two 
dozen demonstrators were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in 
Roe vs. Wade," said Harvard law professor Charles Fried, the former solicitor 
general who was asked to return to Administration service for this case. 
</P>
<P>
Fried was one of three lawyers participating in an hourlong argument over 
disputed Missouri abortion regulations, a case that has become a focal point 
for the emotionally charged battle over a woman's right to end her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking the court to unravel the fabric" of individual privacy 
rights, Fried told the justices. "We are asking the court to pull this one 
thread." 
</P>
<P>
But St. Louis lawyer Frank Susman, representing those who successfully 
challenged the restrictive Missouri regulations in lower courts, responded, 
"When I pull a thread, my sleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a 
thread he's after." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Agonize' 
</P>
<P>
Susman urged the justices to uphold the 1973 ruling, stating, "Women do not 
make these decisions lightly. They agonize over them. . . . State legislatures 
have no business invading this decision." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri Atty. Gen. William Webster, defending the state's abortion 
regulations, said, "The government certainly is not obligated to become an 
advocate for abortion." 
</P>
<P>
He contended that lower courts were "clearly wrong" when they struck down a 
state legislative declaration that "life begins at conception." 
</P>
<P>
As the justices, with questions from the bench, probed the positions of each 
lawyer, the usually tranquil scene outside the court building offered an 
indication of how deeply public opinion runs on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators -- with the pro-choice faction outnumbering the 
anti-abortion side by about 10 to 1 -- carried competing banners and placards 
that said, "Keep Abortion Legal," "Women Must Have the Right to Choose" and 
"Abortion Is Murder." There were 27 arrests on charges of unlawful entry for 
crossing police lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'To See History' 
</P>
<P>
Some people arrived at the court as early as Tuesday afternoon hoping to get a 
prized seat inside for the arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to see history," said Jordy Green, a sophomore at Dartmouth College 
who arrived at 6 p.m. Tuesday to assure himself a courtroom seat. He said he is 
neutral on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
The justices will take their initial private vote in the Missouri case Friday, 
discussing their views and beginning the process of drafting and redrafting 
opinions to accompany the announcement of the court's decision, expected by 
July. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to sway the justices, Americans in record numbers have been 
writing and telephoning the court to express their views. Tens of thousands of 
letters arrive each day, and the court's two switchboards were so flooded with 
calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated.

ANTI-ABORTIONISTS CONSIDER D.A.'S OFFER ON CHARGES IN CYPRESS PROTEST

<TEXT>
<P>
About 370 defendants charged with unlawful assembly in a March 23 anti-abortion 
protest in Cypress appeared at West Municipal Court in Westminster this morning 
to enter their pleas. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to avoid the expense of individual trials, the Orange County 
district attorney's office offered to reduce the misdemeanor charge to an 
infraction and charge each defendant $75 to $125 in court costs. The 
arrangement, however, depended on all 370 pleading either guilty or no contest 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Terry, a leader of the national Operation Rescue, sent word to the 
defendants not to accept the district attorney's arrangement, according to 
Kenneth Tanner of Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants were granted a recess at noon to discuss the deal.

GLENDALE POLICE RAID BRINGS DRUG MONEY SEIZURES TO TOTAL FOR 1988 
</P>

<P>
After a raid on a house that netted 262 pounds of cocaine and $630,000 in cash, 
Glendale police said they have already seized as much drug money in the first 
four months of this year as was collected in raids all last year. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Thomas M. Rutkoske of the department's investigative services division 
said that Glendale officers confiscated the cash in the raid Friday in Tarzana, 
bringing the department's total this year to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rutkoske said about 75% of the money is expected to be returned to the 
department as its share under anti-drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
At an arraignment Tuesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court, three Colombian 
nationals pleaded not guilty to charges of possessing drugs for sale and money 
from the sale of drugs, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ellen Berk said. Judge David S. 
Milton ordered Francisco Javier Giraldo-Lopez, 33, Henry Gomez, 24, and Fredys 
Perdomo Grueso, 26, all of the Tarzana address, be held on $4-million bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the investigation began in Glendale and led to the house in 
Tarzana.

LUCILLE BALL DIES AT 77; 
</P>
<P>
THE WHOLE WORLD LOVED LUCY DURING TV'S GOLDEN AGE; 
</P>
<P>
SUFFERS AORTA RUPTURE AFTER HEART SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucille Ball, the leggy showgirl, model and B-grade movie queen whose 
pumpkin-colored hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television's 
early years, died early today, a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery. 
She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
The high-spirited star of "I Love Lucy," a show that the nation took to its 
heart as no other and that continues in syndication around the world, died of a 
ruptured abdominal aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokesman 
Ronald Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ball, who had a heart attack and had throat surgery in 1988, underwent 
surgery at Cedars-Sinai on April 18 to replace her aorta and aortic valve and 
had been getting out of bed, eating and even walking around the room in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Her recovery had seemed so certain that her husband, comedian Gary Morton, had 
been exchanging jokes with his wife. She had been asking about their white 
poodle, Tinker. 
</P>
<P>
Wise said the rupture occurred in a portion of the aorta, the main heart 
artery, far from where the operation was performed. 
</P>
<P>
Since the surgery fans had flooded the hospital with hundreds of cards, 
telegrams and even facsimile machine messages. Hospital officials said it was 
the largest outpouring they had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Name Brings a Smile' 
</P>
<P>
Tributes were plentiful and immediate: 
</P>
<P>
"Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made 
her an American institution," former President and Nancy Reagan said in a 
statement. "Just the mention of her name brings a smile. . . . We love Lucy and 
will miss her deeply." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, what a blow. What a shame," said fellow TV clown Dick Van Dyke. "She 
didn't deal in jokes, she dealt in human behavior. She was a great physical 
mime with all the instincts of a Chaplin." 
</P>
<P>
William S. Paley, chairman of CBS Inc., said from New York: "Lucille Ball will 
always be the first lady of CBS. With 'I Love Lucy' she helped establish 
television as the nation's leading entertainment medium. Lucy's extraordinary 
ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will 
last forever." 
</P>
<P>
That legacy involved Miss Ball and her late former husband, Cuban band leader 
Desi Arnaz. They starred regularly from 1951 to 1957 as Lucy and Ricky Ricardo 
in "I Love Lucy." The late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their 
neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz. 
</P>
<P>
The series continued irregularly into the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talent as Entrepreneur 
</P>
<P>
Her singularity as a comedian was matched by her talent as a show-business 
entrepreneur. She and Arnaz established one of TV's first major independent 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
Desilu, as their production company was called, made some of the top comedy 
shows of the 1950s and '60s, including "December Bride," "Our Miss Brooks" and 
"Make Room for Daddy." 
</P>
<P>
As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and Arnaz signed an 
$8-million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953 -- the largest 
in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch 
36 years later. 
</P>
<P>
The actress was last seen introducing the "Young Hollywood" production number 
with Bob Hope at the 61st Academy Awards ceremony March 29, receiving a 
standing ovation. Looking svelte for her years in a fashionable slit skirt, she 
seemed to be in good health and laughed freely throughout a brief routine with 
Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Her last series -- "Life With Lucy," co-starring frequent sidekick Gale Gordon 
-- was carried by ABC at the start of the 1986 season. But the show, Miss 
Ball's first series in 12 years, was canceled after less than two months when 
it drew spectacularly low ratings. Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 
TV movie "Stone Pillow," considered one of the most challenging roles of her 
career. Her timing, wails and pratfalls had made the "I Love Lucy" show one of 
the most popular in television history. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge clubs and bowling teams changed their meeting nights to watch Lucy 
Ricardo and Ethel Mertz come up with yet another harebrained scheme to drive 
their long-suffering husbands, Ricky and Fred, to desperation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-Screen Pregnancy 
</P>
<P>
A Chicago department store changed the night it stayed open because shoppers 
were staying home to watch television. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ball's real, on-screen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an 
estimated 44 million viewers -- more than watched the inauguration of President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower -- tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, the night Lucy Ricardo 
delivered Little Ricky. Her real son was born just four hours before the 
previously filmed show was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Ball was born in Jamestown, N.Y., the daughter of an electrician and a 
concert pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Young Lucy, a natural brunette, was dazzled by the stage, but her ambitions 
were discouraged by an acting school -- "They sent my mother a letter saying 
she was wasting her money" -- and she turned to modeling under the name Diane 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Her ads for Chesterfield cigarettes caught the attention of Hollywood, and in 
1933 she was off to California. As a blonde, she appeared with the Marx 
Brothers in "Room Service," with Fred Astaire in "Follow the Fleet" and with 
Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in "Stage Door." 
</P>
<P>
In all, she appeared in more than 75 movies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CBS Wary of Arnaz 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, her tresses now the fiery trademark red, Miss Ball met Arnaz, a rumba 
star. They married within six months. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, when CBS decided to move her radio series, "My Favorite Husband," to 
television, Miss Ball insisted that Arnaz be her co-star. But the network 
wasn't sure that Arnaz would be a hit with the American public. 
</P>
<P>
The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved that audiences would 
sit still to watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born band leader 
with a heavy accent. CBS relented and her antics became comedy classics: Lucy 
putting too much yeast in the bread, which quickly fills up her kitchen and 
pins her against the wall; Lucy fighting with a fellow grape-presser in a giant 
wine-making vat; Lucy rehearsing a commercial for a health tonic and becoming 
drunk from its alcohol content. 
</P>

Two researchers who say they have mastered fusion, the process that powers the 
sun and the stars, told Congress today that they will duplicate their 
experiments for government scientists in hopes of quieting skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 19 experiments being set up now," University of Utah chemist Stanley 
Pons told the House Science Committee, including a demonstration of 
room-temperature fusion for scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Pons said the federal scientists will monitor the experiment in Utah, then 
dismantle it and take it to the national laboratory in New Mexico for further 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silence Skepticism 
</P>
<P>
Pons and his collaborator, Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton 
in England, are making the arrangement to silence some of the skepticism about 
their claim to have discovered a way to achieve fusion using ordinary lab 
equipment assembled on a table top. 
</P>
<P>
The two announced their discovery March 23, stunning nuclear physicists around 
the world who have attempted to achieve fusion for 25 years using 
multimillion-dollar machines. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was jammed with journalists, scientists and industrial 
representatives eager to learn more about a reaction that some predict could 
produce plentiful electric power with little environmental pollution or threat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gave Off Heat 
</P>
<P>
Pons told the committee how he and Fleischmann had inserted electrodes of 
platinum and palladium in a flask containing deuterium oxide, or heavy water. 
Electrical current was applied to the platinum electrode, Pons said, forcing 
deuterium atoms into the crystal lattice of the palladium. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after the experiment ran for several hours, the deuterium became 
compressed and fused.

Princess Anne, president of the International Equestrian Federation, normally

appearance here came shortly after personal letters written to her by a 
Buckingham Palace staff member disappeared from her palace office and wound up 
in a British tabloid.

The princess chatted with officials from other federations as she passed by

Investors are lining up to become shareholders in the Mappa Mundi in a plan to 
keep the 13th-Century map of the world at Hereford Cathedral, organizers said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A new company called Mappa Mundi PLC is offering the public 7,450 shares at 
about $1,700 each to raise more than $12 million to keep the map at Hereford 
and pay for repairs to its cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Hereford Cathedral caused a national uproar when it announced last year that it 
would auction off its medieval treasure, possibly to foreign buyers, to pay for 
the much-needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
It had hoped to raise $4.3 million by selling the 708-year-old map, which shows 
Jerusalem at the center of the world and Hereford at the edge. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of England subsequently joined forces with financiers to launch the 
unusual privatization.

Police are investigating at least 16 incidents in which baby food bought at 
grocery stores has contained glass shards, pieces of razor blades, thumbtacks 
and caustic soda, news reports said today. 
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard said it was coordinating a nationwide police inquiry, but it 
refused to give details. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail reported today that blackmailers apparently were trying to 
extort money from supermarkets and food companies. It said several supermarket 
chains and food manufacturers had received threats. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers say their investigations have determined that products are not 
being spiked during production and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
One manufacturer, Heinz Co. Ltd., warned parents to be vigilant when feeding 
their children canned and bottled food. 
</P>
<P>
Spiked jars were first found last month in London and in the central cities of 
Bedford and Leicester, news reports said. Further cases have since been 
reported across southern England.

JAPANESE AUTO-PARTS FIRM REJECTS PICKENS' BID FOR SEATS ON BOARD

Japanese auto-parts maker Koito Manufacturing today formally rejected a request 
by U.S. corporate raider T. Boone Pickens for seats on the Koito board, saying 
it doubts that he is the real owner of a large stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
"There is growing speculation that your company is not truly taking on the 
investment risk," Koito said in a letter sent to Pickens today and later 
released to the press. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens may have entered into a variety of options, repurchase or collateral 
arrangements when buying a 20.2% stake in Koito from Azabu Motors Ltd., a 
spokesman for Koito said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have a right to an accurate rendering of the truth," the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Koito President Takao Matsuura, Pickens had asked the Koito 
board to nominate three executives of his private investment firm, Boone Co. of 
Texas, as directors of the company, which makes automotive lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts have said it appears that Pickens is attempting a 
classic, U.S.-style corporate raid in Japan, causing alarm in the tightly knit 
Japanese business community.

ECONOMY, SURPASSING $5-TRILLION MARK, UP AT ANNUAL RATE OF 5.5% 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. economy, surpassing the $5-trillion mark for the first time, expanded 
at a robust annual rate of 5.5% in the first three months of 1989, the fastest 
pace in more than a year, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said almost half of the increase in the gross national 
product came from a statistical catch-up from last year's drought. 
</P>
<P>
But even discounting this bookkeeping factor, the GNP, representing the 
country's total output of goods and services, advanced at a 3% annual rate, 
down only slightly from a 3.5% non-farm growth rate in the final three months 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration hailed the GNP report as good news that the economy is 
continuing to expand at a healthy rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Deficit Improves 
</P>
<P>
Officials noted in particular the fact that the trade deficit, which had been 
widening for two consecutive quarters, showed improvement again in the first 
three months of the year while business investments rose at the fastest pace 
since last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989 from these numbers," J. 
Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist, said at a news 
briefing. "We are getting solid, moderate growth with the kind of mix we need 
at this stage of the expansion." 
</P>
<P>
The non-farm growth was slightly better than economists had been expecting. 
Most analysts believe that the U.S. economy will slow substantially this year 
under the weight of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year, the Federal Reserve has been pushing rates higher in an 
effort to fight rising inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflation Rising 
</P>
<P>
However, the report contained information that inflation is rising. A GNP price 
index that measures a fixed market basket of goods and services rose at an 
annual rate of 5% in the first quarter, up from a fourth-quarter rate of 4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the increase came from a pay increase for federal employees, with 
rising food and home costs accounting for much of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.5% overall increase in the GNP was more than double the 2.4% advance in 
the October-December quarter, the last period in which output was held back 
because of the effects of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
With the start of the new year, the government returned its estimate of farm 
output to normal levels, thus accounting for 2.5 percentage points of the 5.5% 
increase in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The first quarter GNP report provided some evidence that the economy was 
slowing. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, rose 
at a rate of just 1.3%, the slowest advance in more than a year. Purchases of 
durable goods such as autos actually fell by 3.2% in the first quarter while 
purchases of products not expected to last three years edged up 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Housing construction, another key consumer sector, dropped at an annual rate of 
3.6% in the first quarter, the first decline in a year as the housing industry 
suffered under the impact of rising mortgage rates.

Kentucky's athletics director today denied an Associated Press report that the 
school's head basketball coaching job had been offered to Seton Hall Coach P. 
J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
"We had really good dialogue," Athletics Director C. M. Newton said after he 
and Carlesimo met with the head of the broadcasting company that holds the 
rights to Kentucky sport events. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no job offer, no job accepted or contracted for." 
</P>
<P>
Two sources had told the AP that Carlesimo, who guided an unheralded team to 
the runner-up spot in the NCAA tournament this year, would accept the position. 
(Story, Part III, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
Newton said he and Carlesimo met with Jim Host, president of Host 
Communications Co., in order to give Carlesimo a feeling for the job's public 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
He said the three did not discuss money during the session, which lasted about 
75 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Can't Say Anything' 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say anything right now," Carlesimo said as he went into the meeting, 
which followed a breakfast today with university President David Roselle. 
</P>
<P>
Roselle said today, "No offer has been made to Carlesimo, at least yet." 
</P>
<P>
Roselle said Carlesimo's hiring would have to be approved by the school's 
athletics board, of which he is chairman. He said no such board meeting has 
been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an attractive, bright young man and has to be considered a serious 
candidate for the job," Roselle said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo had remained in Lexington after his interview Tuesday with the 
school's screening committee and Newton. 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo just finished the first year of a five-year contract reportedly worth 
a total of $1.2 million. That average salary of $240,000 could probably be 
doubled by Kentucky's overall package. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky is seeking a replacement for Eddie Sutton, who resigned under pressure 
in March after directing the program for four years. School officials went 
before the NCAA Committee on Infractions last weekend in Charleston, S.C., 
responding to 18 allegations of wrongdoing in the basketball program.

Oakland Athletic's slugger Jose Canseco, arrested last week on firearms 
charges, has been dropped from a television commercial sponsored by the 
California Egg Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're spending the money that we are, someone like that just doesn't 
portray the image that we want to portray," Robert Pierre, the commission's 
president, said of Tuesday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco was arrested Friday after a pedestrian spotted a loaded handgun on the 
floor of his cherry-red custom Jaguar. The car was parked at the campus of the 
University of California at San Francisco, where Canseco was having an injured 
wrist attended to. 
</P>
<P>
It is a felony to have an unregistered weapon on a university campus. 
</P>
<P>
The television spot is part of the commission's $4.5-million campaign for the 
year. In it, Canseco says: "Eggs are a terrific source of protein, and protein 
means power. You know what I do with my power."

<P>
Thompson was arrested Feb. 13 after allegedly selling 17 grams of cocaine to 
the undercover agent Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who started much of last season and was expected to be the starter 
for his junior year this season, was suspended from the football team by Coach 
Barry Switzer a few hours before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Ralph G. Thompson delayed the athlete's sentencing for 6 to 
8 weeks, pending a probationary report. The maximum punishment for the charge 
is 20 years in prison and a $2-million fine, plus a special assessment fine of 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was released to the custody of his mother two days after his arrest.

Former San Francisco 49er Carl Monroe, who scored the first touchdown in the 
1985 Super Bowl, died today of a heart attack. He was 29. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe, who lived in San Jose, was taken to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center

Monroe scored San Francisco's first touchdown of the 1984 regular season and 
caught a 33-yard TD pass from Joe Montana to open the scoring in the Super Bowl 
at Stanford Stadium the following January. The 49ers defeated the Miami 
Dolphins in that game, 38-16.
