CONFLICT THEORIES TAKE ON WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former business consultant, Solana Beach psychologist Thomas Gordon has 
seen bosses straight out of "Nightmare on Elm Street" -- intimidating, Freddy 
Krueger-type superiors who stop at nothing to get their way. 
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old author of seven books on interpersonal relationships -- 
including effective parenting and teaching -- has seen how unhealthy aggression 
can poison communication between husbands and wives, students and teachers, 
friends and lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Now the founder of one of the world's largest human relations training firms, 
whose theories are employed by the San Diego Unified School District and firms 
such as Exxon, Coca-Cola and General Motors, wants to take his insights into 
conflict-solving out of the consultation room and onto the street in what he 
calls a global gesture toward world peace. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Gordon's Effectiveness Training Inc. will sponsor free conflict 
resolution training seminars in more than 27 countries -- on the theory that 
solving wars at home and at school isn't much different from solving wars 
between nations. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 authorized instructors will conduct the eight-hour classes in all 
sorts of unlikely venues -- from an auditorium at the Sorbonne in Paris to the 
grand ballroom of a Bermuda hotel to five classroom locations throughout San 
Diego -- counseling people in the art of negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
It's no harmonic convergence, no connecting on telepathic waves, Gordon said -- 
just qualified authorities offering common-sense advice to help people get 
along. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember, negotiating between nations is done by people," he said. 
"You can't achieve world peace all at once. You do it a relationship at a time. 
These seminars are simply aimed at getting people to listen to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're successful, we'll show people there is an alternative to violence. 
And that not only applies to breakdowns between nations, but between husbands 
and wives, parents and children, teachers and students, just about anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Called "No-Lose Conflict-Resolution Training," the course will teach 
participants 15 and older specific skills to end power struggles, turn 
arguments into agreements and replace competition with cooperation, Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His six-step method defuses power struggles by clarifying and meeting the needs 
of both parties in any disagreement. The goal is teaching people that they 
don't have to be the victor in every dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"All relationships have conflicts -- they're inevitable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are ways to handle these conflicts so neither person comes out 
feeling like they're the loser. In the end, it will help people develop better, 
more satisfying and enduring relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon has credentials to back up his experience. A former psychology professor 
at the University of Chicago, he maintained a private practice in Pasadena for 
18 years while writing a series of books to teach people how to communicate 
more effectively. Today, his Solana Beach firm offers courses on all aspects of 
interpersonal communication. 
</P>
<P>
He is perhaps best known for his "Parent Effectiveness Training" and "Teacher 
Effectiveness Training" books, which have sold millions of copies worldwide, 
the psychologist said. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Foster, assistant superintendent for the San Diego Unifed School 
District, said the district has endorsed several of Gordon's teaching 
techniques. "We support what he's done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very legitimate. He's done a lot of work with teachers and parents 
throughout the county and the state. He's committed. He's not just one of those 
fly-by-nights who comes rolling through with a package to sell." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, past president of the California State Psychological Assn. and member 
of two White House task committees on children, said many of his peace-keeping 
theories originated during years spent as a consultant for business and 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I found the most successful offices had supervisors who listened to their 
staff, who solicited their opinions," he said. "But too many were run by overly 
aggressive jerks who always made a point of getting their way." 
</P>
<P>
The same scenario develops in households and at school, where parents and 
teachers too often go overboard in their attempts to play boss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's parents who use punishment to resolve conflicts, who never learn that 
punishment doesn't control kids, who end up with antisocial children who suffer 
psychologically, often the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon dreamed up the idea for the worldwide seminars several years ago as a 
small gesture to further world peace. The classes will be taught by teachers 
from South Africa to the Soviet Union who have been instructed in Gordon's 
theories of one-on-one communication, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So who does crisis-solver Gordon look up to as the Grand Master of 
Negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
"It's Jimmy Carter -- for the work he did at Camp David bringing a resolution 
to the Arab-Israeli conflict," he said. "In four or five days, he took the 
leaders of two countries that had been bitter enemies for as long as anyone can 
remember and got them to come to terms on their differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Two men who had never even shaken hands before hugged one another on world 
television. We can all learn something from a gesture like that."

VERDICT ON CUP LEAVES QUESTIONS IN WAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reality of San Diego winning the chance -- finally -- to serve as host of 
the America's Cup regatta in 1992 brought hurrahs and cheers from many corners 
of the city Thursday, but the questions of a few clouded the enthusiasm of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after the New York Court of Appeals upheld by a 5-2 vote a lower court 
decision awarding sailing's top prize to the San Diego Yacht Club, city 
officials and others debated just what it meant and how everyone ought to 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $1.2-billion windfall the event is expected to bring the city had 
a lot of people excited. 
</P>
<P>
"We're particularly happy the citizens of San Diego have the America's Cup 
back," said Al Reese, spokesman for the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors 
Bureau. "The Cup competition will bring significant international attention to 
San Diego as a destination, and a significant number of international 
visitors." 
</P>
<P>
In the office of Mayor Maureen O'Connor, the reaction was equally positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the mayor is delighted -- this is great for San Diego," said Paul 
Downey, the mayor's press secretary. "We've been fighting for well over two 
years to get the Cup here, to earn the right to a full-scale regatta, and now 
we'll have it in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, 1992 is a bit misleading. The finals of the America's Cup regatta 
will begin in May, 1992, but Tom Ehman of the America's Cup Organizing 
Committee said preparations, and preliminary races will begin long before then. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said the "challenge period" will allow international yachting syndicates 
to enter the Cup competition for one more month. By May 26, he said, the 
committee will have a list of the estimated 12 to 20 syndicates that will come 
from as far away as Japan, West Germany, Sweden -- and, yes, even New Zealand 
-- to compete. It was Michael Fay's Mercury Bay Boating Club of Auckland, New 
Zealand, that was the plaintiff in the longstanding litigation that kept the 
San Diego Yacht Club at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said another important date is May 30, when competitors will meet to 
spell out rules and conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's a big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By Christmas, he said, syndicates will be arriving and setting up camp, and a 
year from now, in May 1991, the city will play host to a world championship 
race, a kind of "dress rehearsal," in Ehman's words, followed by the America's 
Cup trials from January through April of 1992. The two teams that win the 
challenge races will vie for the America's Cup trophy a month later. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman conceded that it's "a lot to get done" in a short time, and some openly 
wondered if everything that needs to happen will, in fact, happen. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nay, port director of the San Diego Unified Port District, said he has "no 
idea" how much preparations for the race will cost, or who will pay for it. 
But, because port revenues now exceed expenditures by more than $40 million a 
year, Nay said he expects a few people to cast "a hungry eye" toward his 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a question of how much we'll have to spend for the lawsuit in which 
Point Loma residents are suing us in a $200-million complaint," Nay said, 
referring to litigation brought by homeowners irate over noise from Lindbergh 
Field, which is operated by the Port District. "We also have the duty of 
ridding the bay of toxic pollution, and that may cost $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure people will turn to us, but we have many more demands than 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Board of Port Commissioners has long been enthusiastic about 
the city's chances for being host of the world's premier yachting spectacle. 
Commissioner Dan Larsen was once quoted as saying the port would pay "whatever 
it costs" to get the event. 
</P>
<P>
Nay said money is not the only problem. Recent rule changes in keel size could 
prevent access to parts of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"They've increased the draft from 9 to 13 or 14 feet, which eliminates a good 
deal of our bay from housing these syndicates," Nay said. "We have a very 
shallow bay. Plus, no Harbor Island marinas are available, few on Shelter 
Island are available, and it's next to impossible to dredge because of 
environmental concerns. I honestly don't know where many of these syndicates 
will go." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said the 14-foot draft poses "a bit of a problem, but I thought it would 
be a bigger problem than it looks like it's going to be. In other words, I'm 
more optimistic than I was before." 
</P>
<P>
He said the committee has isolated 20 sites around the area, extending from 
Mission Bay to National City. He said private shipyards and marinas will house 
most of the crews "without environmentally intrusive work having to be done." 
He mentioned Commercial Basin as one possible site. 
</P>
<P>
And cost? 
</P>
<P>
"It could be next to nothing, if all are accommodated in private shipyards," 
Ehman said. "Some improvements may be necessary, and those may cost several 
million dollars, but we expect private money to be the source of that. And, 
whatever is done has residual value. It benefits the sites long after the race 
is over." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said that, if any public money is used "it will be port money. In other 
words, it will be port revenue, which is quasi-public money but isn't taxpayer 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said the committee's operating budget is about $20 million. Most of that 
goes to organizing the event and paying for administration, race management and 
overhead. He said the Media Center, which took up a 20,000-square-foot building 
when the race was held in Fremantle, Australia, may end up in the B Street Pier 
area, but again, private money is hoped to be the primary funding source. The 
former San Diego Police headquarters was used as media center for the America's 
Cup Challenge in 1988, but that site is no longer available. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said the estimated $1.2 billion in revenues for the city -- a figure 
based on a 1987 research study -- should exceed all previous America's Cup 
competitions. He said the 1983 race in Newport, R.I., brought in an estimated 
$500 million, with the last America's Cup netting Fremantle and nearby Perth 
$650 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman estimated the event as having the impact of eight to nine Super Bowls 
being played in San Diego all at once. 
</P>
<P>
Downey said the city expects an economic windfall from the event, using the 
recent Soviet Arts Festival and the 1988 Super Bowl as barometers. He said the 
three-week arts festival brought in $50 million, the one-week Super Bowl 
festivities $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that five to six months of trials will precede the finals, I see the $1 
billion figure as realistic," Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was inclined to laud the economic benefits, and some were 
skeptical about the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced of the economic boon to the city, and I'm delighted it will be 
held here," said City Councilman Bob Filner, whose District 8 includes 
waterfront areas. "It's clear to me that the city ought to work with the group 
that's going to sponsor this thing and facilitate it the best way we can. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are not in a position to pump public financing into the America's Cup. 
It's not only because of our $60-million budget deficit, although that's 
certainly a factor. But this boon that's predicted will go only toward 
well-defined sectors -- hotels, restaurants, etc. If some subsidy has to come 
on the front end, why don't those groups get together and put the money up? Why 
does it have to be public money? 
</P>
<P>
"The groups that directly benefit, these are the ones that ought to be funding. 
I don't know what the thing costs, but I've seen figures in the millions of 
dollars thrown around, and I'm hardly prepared to support that," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the type of event in which the vast majority of the city's population 
will not be involved, or even able to witness the event. If this is such a big 
moneymaker, why is it costing anything? Governmental monies can't be 
justified." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a bill designed to help finance preparations for the race was 
introduced by Assemblyman Bob Frazee (R-Carlsbad), but Richard Ledford, 
Frazee's chief of staff, said Thursday that the bill has been withdrawn from 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Ledford said the bill proposed to loan either the city or county $10 million 
with which to fund race preparations. 
</P>
<P>
"But neither the city nor the county felt comfortable with repayment coming 
from the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT), or the state taking a portion of 
revenue from city and county sales taxes," Ledford said. "So, it's dead." 
</P>
<P>
Downey said the mayor's office wants to work with the organizing committee as 
much as possible, but with talk of libraries and parks being closed and funding 
for the arts slashed to accommodate budgetary needs, the city can't justify 
money for a yacht race, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to hard cash," he said, "we just don't have it."

NEWS NOT GOOD ON MAHER TUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors at Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Institution in La Jolla, who on 
Wednesday removed most of a cancerous growth from the brain of Roman Catholic 
Bishop Leo T. Maher of San Diego, on Thursday upgraded the bishop's condition 
to satisfactory from serious. 
</P>
<P>
However, doctors also told Maher that the growth that had impaired his physical 
abilities is the "fastest-growing" of its type, Scripps spokeswoman Sue Pondrom 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not real good news," Pondrom said. "The bishop has a grade four malignant 
glioma. These (tumors) are graded one to four, and he's got the fastest-growing 
type." 
</P>
<P>
Maher on Thursday decided to "fight this thing aggressively with radiation 
therapy and chemotherapy," Pondrom said. "He's going to begin radiation therapy 
in one to two weeks, and (treatment) will last four to six weeks." Chemotherapy 
will begin after radiation therapy is concluded, Pondrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Maher was reported to be "cheerful and in good spirits," Pondrom said. "He's 
even been out walking in the halls." 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons on Wednesday removed most of a cancerous growth from the rear of 
Maher's brain during a 2 1/2-hour operation. Maher checked into Scripps on 
Monday, complaining of a loss of physical strength and impaired peripheral 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at first suspected a mild stroke, but testing revealed the tumor, which 
was about 3 inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
During a Wednesday press conference, Dr. Thomas Waltz, who conducted the 
operation, described the tumor as life-threatening because it "would have . . . 
and might still continue to grow." Waltz expressed hope that Maher's tumor 
would be one of the slower-growing varieties. 
</P>
<P>
However, laboratory tests completed Thursday determined that the glioma was of 
the fastest-growing type. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers do not yet understand why the gliomas form and why some quickly 
return after surgery. Although many tumors might lay dormant for decades, "the 
more aggressive ones may come back in a few months," Waltz said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors were unable to completely remove the growth on Wednesday because this 
type of tumor "infiltrates among functioning brain cells," Waltz said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he was in critical danger in terms of hours or days, but these 
tumors do progress and eventually cause pressure on the rest of the brain," 
Waltz said Wednesday. "When that occurs, patients tend to lose consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors on Thursday were uncertain if Maher would totally regain the physical 
strength and peripheral vision that were damaged by the growth. However, 
Maher's "mental status was good, and he was talking well" before the operation, 
said Dr. Donald Dalessio, a Scripps neurologist who examined Maher on Monday.

TEXACO TO REPLACE 1-MILE SECTION OF AGING OIL PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texaco Inc., under pressure from city and county officials, will replace a 
one-mile section of an aging crude-oil pipeline near the Santa Clara River in 
central Fillmore because it has ruptured three times in the last year, a 
company spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old pipeline, which runs through the city to connect an oil field 
with a pumping station, "is holding up pretty well for the most part. But it is 
breaking for that mile, so we're going to pull it out," said Texaco's Tomi Van 
de Brooke. 
</P>
<P>
It will be replaced at a cost of $100,000 sometime this year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's decision follows an April 10 leak at River and A streets that 
dumped 1,100 gallons of gooey, foul-smelling oil into a gutter that drains into 
the river a quarter of a mile away, Fillmore and Ventura County officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As with the two other recent breaks, which each also released several hundred 
gallons of oil, the flow was blocked before it reached the river, and cleanup 
was completed within 24 hours, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But the repeated breaks prompted City Fire Chief Pat Askren and the county 
environmental health office -- neither of which could mandate action -- to 
verbally request that Texaco replace the line, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them on the scene that they ought to do something about it," Askren 
said. He said the oil is unusually thin for crude and "highly volatile." 
</P>
<P>
However, the fire chief said, his biggest fear is not of fire but that the 
Texaco line will break late at night and oil will flow undetected down River 
Street to a culvert that drains directly into the nearby river. 
</P>
<P>
"But this crude oil smells bad enough that it would probably wake somebody up," 
he said. "It's really obnoxious stuff." 
</P>
<P>
County Environmental Health Officer Greg Smith said he also complained to 
Texaco after the recent break. If nothing else, the oozing oil is "a heck of a 
nuisance," he said. He is writing a letter formally requesting a new line, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state fire marshal's office, which regulates large oil 
pipelines, said that no government agency oversees small feeder lines such as 
Texaco's for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not a trunk line, it probably doesn't fall under anybody's 
jurisdiction," said Tom Lael, of the fire marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
After disastrous fires, some California cities have successfully implemented 
their own pipeline regulations. For example, Los Angeles and Long Beach have 
passed laws requiring annual pipeline inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Askren said Fillmore officials have not pressed harder for action because no 
real damage has been caused by four Texaco breaks in the last five years or by 
the rupture of a Unocal Corp. line in the same vicinity about 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Brooke said Texaco has not determined the cause of the recent breaks. 
Despite its age, the line is not seriously damaged by corrosion, she said. Nor 
is the pressure within the line high enough to be a cause of the problem by 
itself, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The line, six inches in diameter, carries crude oil six miles from the Shields 
Canyon oil field south of Fillmore, across the Santa Clara River Bridge and to 
a pumping station just east of the city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The section to be replaced runs from the bridge north to River Street, then 
east to Orchard Street, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The oil eventually is pumped south from Fillmore to Texaco's regional refinery 
in Wilmington, in Los Angeles' South Bay area.

HIGH SCHOOLS TRY TO EASE CROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN KUSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard Union High School District has approved plans to reduce crowding in 
two of its high schools by realigning enrollment boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, 157 students enrolled in Channel Islands and Oxnard high 
schools next September will be transferred to the less-crowded Rio Mesa and 
Hueneme high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Camarillo High School and Frontier High School will not be affected 
by the boundary changes. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to parents' concerns that brothers and sisters will be separated by 
the boundary changes, trustees said they will allow students with siblings in 
the district to attend either the older student's high school or the school of 
the new ninth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees said the changes are necessary to even out enrollment in the 
11,000-student district. Channel Islands High School is the most crowded of the 
district's six schools, with 2,692 students in a school designed for 2,240. 
Oxnard High School is the second-most crowded, with 2,379 students in a school 
designed to hold 2,060. 
</P>
<P>
The realignment of boundaries will last until 1993 or 1994, when construction 
is expected to be completed on two new schools in Oxnard. By then, the district 
expects to absorb an additional 1,000 students into its system. 
</P>
<P>
But crowding has already become so serious within the two high schools that 
trustees have been forced to make the interim changes, said Gary Davis, 
assistant superintendent for educational services. CAROLYN KUSKY

LITTLE RADON FOUND IN TRACT'S 1ST TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Extremely low levels of radon have been found in an Oak Park condominium whose 
owner is the first to test for the gas since Pardee Construction Co. reversed 
its earlier position and allowed customers to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The developer had prohibited the test and for two years had required customers 
to sign disclaimers releasing it from liability if the gas was later found. 
</P>
<P>
But the company reversed its position after the state Department of Real Estate 
ordered it earlier this month to stop selling homes while officials reviewed 
the disclaimer. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Hall hired a geologist to test the site, and results show low levels of 
the substance in his condominium in the Capri subdivision on Lindero Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
Geologist Donald Carlisle said the average level of radon was 0.5 picocuries 
per liter of air. The Environmental Protection Agency lists 4 picocuries per 
liter of air as potentially dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said he wanted to take precautions because, after learning that Pardee was 
asking customers to sign radon disclaimers freeing the company of liability, he 
became fearful that Pardee was hiding a problem. He said he was also suspicious 
because the developer was prohibiting customers from conducting their own radon 
tests before the sale was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee officials have said that they know of no radon problems in any of their 
subdivisions. They were merely asking customers to sign the disclaimers as a 
precaution, officials have said.

STUDENTS RETURN TO BEACH TO CLEAN UP 
</P>

<P>
Students from Lincoln School cleaned up the beach near the Ventura Pier a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
They went back Thursday, and guess what -- a mess again. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-grader Micayla Drew, 10, wrinkled her nose and surveyed the scene. "It's 
kind of disappointing to see all this litter still here," she said as she 
started across the sand with a trash bag. 
</P>
<P>
She and her classmates are the first in a state program in which schools adopt 
a stretch of beach. They've promised to keep a one-mile strip of sand spiffy 
from the pier south to San Pedro Street. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're through, it's not going to look like a junkyard," said Nick 
Smedley, 10. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair that we have to keep on cleaning it, but our only other choice 
is to just live with it," fifth-grader Jesse Spring said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to outdoor janitorial training, the program includes lectures on 
marine life and beach ecology. Litter, park ranger Andrew Zilke said, 
constitutes first-hand knowledge of environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Spreading out over the sand, about 100 pupils scoured the beach for glass, cans 
and paper cups. They divided the trash into different bags for recyclables and 
throwaways. In 2 1/2 hours, they collected 70 pounds, Zilke said. 
</P>
<P>
The children were mindful that trash can be mistaken for food by sea gulls and 
seals. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't clean up these things now, we might not have these animals around 
much longer," said Brittany Adams, 10. "I want my kids to enjoy the beach like 
I do." CAROLYN KUSKY

DISTRICT CALLS FOR BIDS ON NEW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the Moorpark Unified School District have moved to seek bids on a 
new elementary school planned for the city's growing West Village. 
</P>
<P>
The school, estimated to cost $4 million, would cover 36,346 square feet and 
house 526 children. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials Tuesday acknowledged that the school, needed to relieve 
overcrowding, will not be built unless voters approve a statewide proposition 
in June that provides money for school construction and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
The West Village school project was approved by the state in 1989, but no money 
was available then, Supt. Tom Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been money at that time, they would have given us money to build 
the school," Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
The call for bids means the board has completed planning the school. Bids are 
due by May 24. 
</P>
<P>
The board also considered a proposal by a Los Angeles firm Tuesday to develop 
Moorpark Memorial High School, which closed in 1988. The board met in closed 
session to discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Since its closure, the old high school has been used by the Moorpark 
continuation school. The Moorpark Boys and Girls Club is trying to purchase the 
Memorial school gym. Negotiations over the past year with a development firm 
that was interested in the Casey Road property have fallen apart, Duffy said, 
and the district is reconsidering a proposal that it previously rejected. ADAM

STATE TO TAKE OVER COUNTY LAND FOR LANCASTER PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the objections of Los Angeles County and city of Lancaster 
representatives, the state Department of Corrections received the go-ahead 
Thursday to acquire 285 acres of county land for a proposed state prison in 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
The decision enables the state to use eminent domain to acquire the site in the 
Mira Loma area of Lancaster. County officials have opposed the acquisition 
because they say they need the land for expansion of existing law enforcement 
and health facilities. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said in a prepared statement: "The county 
will take all necessary steps to prevent the state's land grab of county 
property that is desperately needed for community purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Stephen Zehner said he did not know whether county 
lawyers will file a separate injunction aimed at blocking the acquisition or 
pursue the issue at an August hearing on lawsuits filed against the proposed 
prison by the city of Lancaster and the county. 
</P>
<P>
Corrections officials said they expect the acquisition to be completed in time 
to begin scheduled construction of the medium- and maximum-security, 2,200-bed 
prison in August. The process will involve a court filing by the state to 
purchase the land at a fair market value of about $6.7 million, said Barbara 
Lemus, manager of the construction project. The decision was made by the state 
Public Works Board. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has argued that the Lancaster prison and a proposed companion 
facility in East Los Angeles are needed because the county produces 40% of the 
state's inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Although the decision was not unexpected, prison opponents testifying at the 
Public Works Board hearing included lawyers for the city and county, members of 
a Lancaster anti-prison citizens committee and Assemblyman Phillip Wyman 
(R-Tehachapi). 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Lewis, head of the committee, said after the hearing that the state 
should refrain from moving forward with acquisition and construction until the 
legal fight is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and other opponents were bolstered by a move last week in the Assembly to 
eliminate $315 million for the two prisons from this year's state budget. 
</P>
<P>
But corrections officials said they are required by law to move forward with 
the prison project as quickly as possible. They said they expect the governor 
to fight hard for reinstatement of the prison funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proceeding as if the funding will be available," corrections department 
spokeswoman Christine May said.

NEW GUIDES OFFER FRESH GLIMPSES OF L.A. SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A RESULT OF PROPOSITION 98, THE 'REPORT CARDS' COVER 13 CATEGORIES, 
INCLUDING ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND AVERAGE CLASS SIZE. 
</P>

<P>
More than a quarter of the students at Taft High School, a school in the upper 
middle-class community of Woodland Hills that has won national academic honors, 
are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen percent of the students at North Hollywood High School earn A's in 
their English classes, the same percentage as fail. 
</P>
<P>
And San Fernando Junior High hands out 100 awards for student achievement each 
month and 1,006 awards for citizenship during each grading period. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and prospective home buyers interested in informational tidbits such as 
those about San Fernando Valley schools could get them beginning Thursday by 
asking for "report cards" that every school in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District is supposed to have available. The detailed, six-page reports cover 13 
categories that include academic performance, dropout rate and average class 
size. 
</P>
<P>
The student accountability reports, part of the Proposition 98 school funding 
initiative approved by voters in November, 1988, are a consumers' guide to the 
district, giving anyone interested in getting to know the district better a 
complete picture of individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the information in the reports has been available from different 
sources, but this is the first time it has been compiled in one document, said 
Lu Hishmeh, a district administrative consultant who helped schools put the 
data together. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents and the community should have those kind of facts and figures 
about our schools," Taft Principal Ron Berz said. 
</P>
<P>
The information in the reports is for the 1988-89 school year. The reports are 
available at individual school offices, and some principals said they will send 
the evaluations home with students. 
</P>
<P>
But on the first day that the reports were to have been available, some school 
office workers were reluctant to release them. Others seemed not to be aware of 
the reports. District officials said they will tell regional superintendents at 
a meeting today that the reports are to be given to anyone who asks for them. 
</P>
<P>
A random cross-section of San Fernando Valley schools shows that: 
</P>
<P>
* High school enrollments appear to be declining while junior highs and 
elementary schools are growing. Enrollment at North Hollywood High School, for 
instance, has dropped from 2,500 in 1985-86 to 2,218 in 1988-89. Enrollment at 
Sylmar Elementary School has grown from 759 to 936 during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
* Class sizes generally average between 26 and 32 students, at or below state 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
* Suspensions and expulsions at Taft High School in 1988-89 were among the 
highest in the Valley. Suspensions numbered 533, and 23 students were expelled. 
</P>
<P>
"We run a pretty tight ship here at Taft," Berz said. North Hollywood suspended 
245 students and expelled one. Birmingham High School in Van Nuys suspended 539 
students but expelled none. 
</P>
<P>
* Latino enrollment at San Fernando Junior High, which is 92.7%, is among the 
highest in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Plog, head counselor at Mulholland Junior High in Van Nuys, said he thought 
that the evaluations were a good way to introduce parents to the nuts and bolts 
of a school, but the best way to evaluate a school is to visit it. 
</P>
<P>
"Casual observation is not shown on the report," he said.

SEVEN 'BOILER ROOM' OPERATORS PLEAD GUILTY TO MAIL FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven owners and operators of a telephone marketing "boiler room" pleaded 
guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to 14 counts of mail 
fraud for using high-pressure sales techniques, subtle bribery, and lies to 
persuade office managers to buy excessive quantities of copy machine toner at 
grossly inflated prices -- a swindle federal prosecutors said grossed more than 
$14 million in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gary S. Lincenberg said the owners and top managers of 
Copy Supply Warehouse were the first to be convicted in a recent crackdown on 
"boiler room" operations that specialize in the "toner phoner," which U.S. 
Postal Service investigators said is popular among many illicit "boiler rooms" 
operating in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Copy Supply Warehouse, based in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles with at 
least seven offices nationwide, was one of the largest "toner phoner" 
operations in the country, Lincenberg said. Consumer bureaus and law 
enforcement officials received hundreds of complaints from hospitals, schools, 
and businesses whose office managers had fallen prey to the scheme, Lincenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Levin-Epstein, the office manager of a small New York law firm who was 
scheduled to be a key prosecution witness if the case had gone to trial, told 
The Times in an interview last year that he was drawn into the scheme when a 
sales agent from the Copy Supply Warehouse called to ask him for a final order 
for copy machine toner for his office before a scheduled price increase. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking he was dealing with the firm's authorized supplier, he ordered two 
cases to take advantage of the lower prices. When the bill arrived, it was 
three times higher than the normal price for toner, he said. But a month later, 
Levin-Epstein was notified the rest of his order was being shipped, which he 
thought explained the high bill. The next four cases of toner were followed by 
another bill and a color TV that the Copy Supply Warehouse said that 
Levin-Epstein had won in a lottery for customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Copy Supply Warehouse sent out gifts to "hook a mooch" -- to turn office 
purchasing agents into willing collaborators by giving them gifts if they 
continued to pay for overpriced and excessive quantities of toner, the 
indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Copy Supply Warehouse, Miklos Rath, 56, pleaded guilty to three 
counts of mail fraud, and faces more than 15 years in state prison, Lincenberg 
said. Rath's two sons -- Peter Rath, 27, and Steven Rath, 26 -- and his 
sister-in-law, Ilana Baruch Pinhas, 43, each pleaded guilty to two counts of 
mail fraud, as did Alonso Enrique Campbell, 28, and Sydney Katchem, 24. Denise 
Eileen Derrico, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud. Under the plea 
agreement , the seven will pay a total of $530,000 in fines and restitution.

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MURDER IN GIRL'S FATAL FALL FROM TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A plea of not guilty was entered Thursday by a 28-year-old man charged with 
murder in the death of a 12-year-old girl who was allegedly pushed from a 
moving pickup truck on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Hector Garcia of City Heights is scheduled to appear in Municipal Court 
May 10 for a preliminary hearing. On Thursday, Municipal Judge Terry J. Knoepp 
set bail at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is extremely serious because it involves different factors," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz said outside the courtroom. The suspect "left the scene, 
and the case involves a 12-year-old which was either pushed or tried to escape. 
He also has two prior drug offenses. Bail is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Alex M. Loebig Jr. disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is way too high," he said. "He's a pretty straight guy, been working, owns 
his own home. It was just an accident. The girl has a history of acting up. 
She's a runaway. I don't know if she was a bad person, but she was emotionally 
unstable. He was just giving her a ride home because her relatives asked him. 
She may have jumped out of the car." 
</P>
<P>
A bail review hearing is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get the bail drastically reduced," Loebig said. "We are concerned 
that he left the scene of the crime, and it's too bad he did, but it was just a 
tragic reaction to a devastating accident that took him by surprise. He said 
that she got hysterical and jumped out." 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the victim "walked away" about two weeks ago from 
Hillcrest Receiving Home, a facility for children under county care. The mother 
described the girl as "incorrigible," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said an inquiry into the incident is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have numerous witnesses, and police felt they had sufficient evidence to 
file murder charges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness told police that he saw the incident about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. The 
witness said a red, four-wheel-drive Toyota pickup truck with oversized tires 
was northbound on I-5 when he saw the girl lean toward the driver, the 
passenger door open and the girl being ejected. The girl landed on a service 
road about 50 feet north of the Old Town exit. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Marie Rodriguez died of multiple injuries, according to the coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Police obtained a search warrant based on information from relatives who knew 
the suspect. Garcia was arrested Tuesday shortly before 4 a.m. at his home in 
the 3400 block of 45th St. Police also recovered a 1989 red Toyota pickup with 
large tires.

CARLSBAD COUNCIL BACKS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH TEMPORARY MIGRANT SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Carlsbad City Council voted unanimously Thursday to support a local group's 
effort to establish a temporary emergency shelter for homeless migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed a presentation by Kathleen Wellman of the 50-member group 
Caring Residents of Carlsbad, which is seeking grants to establish and manage 
the shelter in conjunction with the nonprofit Catholic Charities of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a temporary shelter, and we're hoping we'll have two full years of 
use," Wellman, a Carlsbad attorney, told the council. 
</P>
<P>
The special meeting was called to meet an application deadline of today for 
state funds and a Monday deadline for federal funds. Organizers of the project, 
which has a budget of $634,000 for two years, hope to receive $396,000 from the 
grants and the rest from monetary and other donations from the community. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter would house 50 homeless men, practically all of them migrant 
workers, Wellman said in a letter to City Manager Ray Patchett. 
</P>
<P>
The men would be allowed to stay for up to 60 days, during which time paid 
staff and volunteers would help them find permanent shelter and jobs and 
further "their integration into our community," the letter says. People living 
at the shelter would have to be in the country legally. 
</P>
<P>
The Paul Ecke family agreed to accommodate the proposed shelter "on an 
emergency, short-term basis," family counsel Chris Calkins said at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-acre site offered by the Eckes is at Palomar Airport and Hidden Valley 
roads, and the offer is contingent upon the project receiving the state and 
federal grants. Calkins said the land is now farmed, "but it's not 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good piece of property by the road and is suitable for housing," 
Wellman said after the meeting, adding that the Eckes offered the property 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bud Lewis said after the meeting that the vote does not signal a change 
in city policy toward the migrant issue or housing of the homeless, but rather 
supports a private group's effort to address the issue of migrant homeless in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we will assist" the group, he said. "But, when you talk about hard 
bucks, and lots of bucks, we're going to have to discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
Wellman had gone before the Carlsbad Unified School District on Wednesday to 
request use of district land as a site for the shelter, but received a lukewarm 
reception. The school board agreed to discuss the proposal formally at its May 
9 meeting.

STORM MAY SKIRT S.D. THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major spring storm is brewing over the Rocky Mountains, but the rains will 
probably skirt San Diego this weekend, according to the National Weather 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a close call," said San Diego forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. 
"As the storm intensifies over the West, clouds may thicken enough to give us 
drizzle Sunday morning." 
</P>
<P>
The storm is developing from a deepening low-pressure front and will dump rain 
from the Pacific Northwest throughout Northern California, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy mists or drizzles will reach San Diego by Sunday, but San Diego will 
escape the heavy showers forecast for the northwest over the weekend. But there 
is a slim chance the showers could roll in early next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the weak Santa Ana winds that raised temperatures a degree or 
two above the seasonal norm of 68 on Thursday will give way to a weak coastal 
eddy, Shigehara said. The coastal flow will bring increasing night and morning 
fog and clouds today and slowly push the temperature downward.

"We'll hover at about 69 degrees today, and by Saturday we'll be close to the 
seasonal norm of about 67 or 68 for Lindbergh Field," he said. Daytime skies 
will be sunny today and Saturday except for cloudiness at the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really beach weather," he said. "Clouds are already clinging to our 
coast, and we can see the fog bank." 
</P>
<P>
Beach temperatures will range from 64 to 68 today and Saturday, dropping to 62 
to 66 by Sunday, Shigehara said. The water temperature is holding at 63 
degrees, and waves are rolling in at 3 to 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal temperatures in the 68 to 74 range are expected today, rising a couple 
of degrees on Saturday. Nights are expected to cool down to 52 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
The weather will be "pretty warm today for folks visiting the Wild Animal Park 
and other inland areas such as El Cajon," Shigehara said. Temperatures will 
rise to 75 to 80 today, but begin falling Saturday, settling between 68 and 75 
on Sunday, he said. Nighttime temperatures ranging from 48 to 55 are forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Skies over the mountain and desert areas will be fair today, with lots of stars 
visible tonight, said Shigehara. But the clouds will start pushing in by 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rain will hold off for the mountain and desert areas" on Sunday, 
but winds will blow in from the west at gusts up to 25 m.p.h., Shigehara said. 
Southwesterly winds in the coastal areas may reach 20 m.p.h. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the mountains may reach up to 70 today and Saturday, but slide 
down to 62 to 68 on Sunday. Nighttime lows will dip down into the 30- to 
40-degree range. In the deserts, "think warm," Shigehara said. Temperatures 
will hit the middle 90s today and Saturday, dropping to 84 to 88 on Sunday, he 
said. Nighttime lows are expected to hover between 52 to 58 over the weekend.

COUNTY FINANCING AGENCY VOTE ADVANCES OTAY MESA JAIL PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Regional Justice Financing Agency, after an often stormy 
debate, Thursday approved a joint memorandum of understanding developed by the 
city and county of San Diego that calls for construction of a $6-million jail 
on city-owned land in Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was needed to qualify the project for Proposition A sales-tax revenue 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sales-tax funds won't immediately be available because of a court 
action that challenges the constitutionality of Proposition A, the urban growth 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed facility would house inmates charged with misdemeanors who have 
not made a court appearance. The city now plans to negotiate a contract with a 
private company to build and operate the jail. It would eventually be 
transferred to the county. 
</P>
<P>
County and city officials agreed on the memorandum of understanding late in 
March. The city has argued that the jail is needed because there are no 
facilities to house those charged with misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy, who also serves on the financing agency, 
has been pushing the county and the financing agency to bypass the misdemeanor 
jail and instead focus on one for felons. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has argued that "we may very well find ourselves in this situation where 
we're housing misdemeanants that are now on the street, while at the same time 
the court has ordered us to release serious felons onto the street."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robber who said he had a gun stole about $2,100 from a Carlsbad bank Thursday 
in the second bank robbery there this week by a man of similar description, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit, described as a heavy-set black man, 20 to 30 years old, held up the 
HomeFed Bank at 7020 Avenida Encinas about 3:50 p.m., Lt. Joe Hasenauer said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was described as wearing a white sun visor and black pants, and was 
last seen running east. 
</P>
<P>
He is suspected of being the bandit who robbed a Coast Savings office at 2520 
El Camino Real of about $700 Tuesday, Sgt. Jim Byler said. Definitive evidence 
will come when bank pictures are developed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both robberies share several characteristics: they occurred at roughly the same 
time, the robber was on foot and he handed the teller a note threatening to use 
a gun but never displayed one.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Tujunga man was sentenced Thursday to 13 years in prison for shooting to 
death a man who he said stole his motorcycle and burglarized his house. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence for Vanjlis D. Garafolo, 32, was the maximum allowed for voluntary 
manslaughter, a charge that he pleaded guilty to April 5 after prosecutors 
agreed to drop murder and assault charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Garafolo also admitted using a firearm in the commission of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Garafolo shot James A. Bailey, 29, in front of Bailey's trailer in 
Sunland on the night of March 6, 1989. Although people were coming in and out 
of the trailer about the time of the shooting, no witnesses to the slaying were 
found, according to court records.

FIXING THE COUNTY'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM FOR NEGLECTED CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jonathan Freedman's two-part series on the conditions of children's services in 
California included many of the current issues prevalent in child welfare 
nationally (California Commentary and Op-Ed Page, April 9-10). As the articles 
indicated, the conditions involved in protecting children from abuse and 
neglect are complex and actions are needed on various levels. 
</P>
<P>
Many of our communities are overwhelmed with drug abuse, violence, crime and 
poverty. Into these conditions our Children's Social Workers (CSW) from the 
Department of Children's Services enter to bring order and stability to 
families for the protection of children. Given our tremendous workload and the 
conditions that surround child abuse and neglect, thousands of tragedies would 
occur if it were not for the prompt actions of CSWs. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions of the current Dependency Court, accurately described in the 
articles, have been a major concern of the Board of Supervisors. The point 
Freedman did not make was that the board has already approved the development 
of the design to construct a new "child-friendly" Children's Court. The new 
Children's Court should be ready by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman included a list of suggested reforms for the child welfare system. 
Most of these reforms would require significant increases in funding at the 
federal and state levels for services to children. The funding for major 
reforms will be possible if national and state leaders can agree that 
significant new approaches are needed for families in America. A number of the 
other suggestions made by Freedman have been implemented or are being pushed 
for implementation right now. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the single most important element in any reform program would be 
to establish prevention programs that would prevent child abuse and neglect. 
Before that can work, our society must be willing to mount the same major 
effort by declaring "war" on child abuse and neglect as has been done in the 
drug program. 
</P>
<P>
Child Abuse Prevention Programs are needed. We must face the grim reality that 
our present system is primarily designed, by law, to act only after abuse or 
neglect has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come to face the critical need for prevention programs. These must 
include classes that teach parenting skills to parents and youth, drug and 
alcohol abuse prevention and treatment, prenatal care services, infant and 
child health programs, and Head Start programs. 
</P>
<P>
The growing problem of child abuse requires a major commitment from all of us 
to build programs that prevent child abuse before it occurs.

REYNOLDS RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am appalled to learn that Ann Reynolds has resigned (as chancellor of the 
20-campus California State University) over the controversy surrounding her 
appreciable pay raise (Part A, April 21). She perhaps was awarded this raise in 
a procedure that can be criticized, but the point is that her position has been 
seriously underpaid for a decade and deserves a compensation level comparable 
to her University of California counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
The salary of David Gardner is in excess of $230,600. The trustees of CSU 
rightfully should raise her salary from $136,248 to $195,000. She supervises a 
budget of $2 billion, encompassing 20 exceptional universities. Reynolds' 
salary is appropriate to her responsibilities and her headaches.

Kudos to Freedman's article "A Charade of Justice for Adults Only." That, and 
his 17 suggestions to prevent future inequities should be applauded and 
implemented by everyone. 
</P>
<P>
His account of what happens to the child after abuse has been reported was 
disturbingly accurate. I called the police about my ex-husband's physical and 
mental abuse of my son, who was 10 years old at the time. We were thrown into 
the system and really were lucky to come out with our sanity. That was 12 years 
ago, but obviously the workings of the system remain the same. Every adult 
needs to readjust priorities. We think nothing of spending great amounts of 
money on cars, homes and entertainment, but when it comes to the future of this 
country, our children, their needs are at the bottom of the list.

Your two-part series on foster children in Los Angeles County was excellent. 
</P>
<P>
We are great at building prisons. In fact, we have four times as many 
individuals per capita in prisons than any other industrialized nation. And 
yet, we can afford so little for prevention of child abuse, the greatest single 
cause of criminal behavior. As Voltaire once said, "The more ancient the abuse, 
the more sacred." 
</P>
<P>
What the story points out is the need for all of us to be more concerned about 
the needs of our most precious resource, tomorrow's children.

ART CENSORSHIP IN CINCINNATI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "Censorship in Cincinnati" (April 10), please 
spare me your superior attitude. Since when is pedophilia or sadomasochism 
something to be celebrated? Or tolerated? There seems to be a general campaign 
by civil libertarians to silence those who oppose this point of view by 
referring to them as unsophisticated yahoos. 
</P>
<P>
It is an effort to desensitize people which I pray to God fails. I am not sure 
how this type of display can be prevented without endangering the very real 
cultural benefits of the National Endowment for the Arts. We might start by 
reminding those in charge that "what we tolerate, we learn to accept, and 
eventually embrace." It is a thought I can hardly bear.

THE LITTLE LIBRARY THAT COULD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is comforting to know that residents of one mid-city Los Angeles 
neighborhood are arguing vehemently with City Hall because of a library. 
</P>
<P>
The city proposes building a new library because the area's 64-year-old 
Washington Irving branch, a historic Romanesque Revival-style building, does 
not meet earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the city must satisfy conflicting neighborhood interests in deciding 
whether to upgrade the old library or build a new one. As more old buildings 
fail to meet safety codes, it's a decision the city will face repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
To many, the Washington Irving branch library on Arlington Avenue is a place 
that nurtures an all-too-rare neighborhood feeling. It provides a stabilizing 
influence. Residents of the slowly gentrifying West Adams area might not always 
agree on such contentious issues as whether a spacious Craftsman house should 
be restored as a one-family dwelling or, more pragmatically, used to house 
several families. But neighborhood differences get left at the door of a 
library, where all types of people go in peaceful and learned pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
It's thus not surprising that some residents want the branch building to be 
renovated and remain a library. But city administrators rightly point out that 
more space is needed in order to accommodate more books and computers. 
Otherwise the library named for the author of "Rip Van Winkle" might find that 
it, too, is years behind the times. 
</P>
<P>
The city proposes a more complete and modern library that would be just 13 
blocks away, currently the site of a carwash. This makes sense. So would 
upgrading the historic building that houses the present branch, perhaps as a 
community center -- where that "neighborhood" feeling it now encourages would 
continue to be nurtured.

WANT TO BE HELD HOSTAGE AGAIN?; 
</P>
<P>
AS THE OIL RESERVE DIPS LOWER AND LOWER, SO DOES OUR CAPACITY TO WITHSTAND 
ANOTHER OIL SHOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, the U.S. government has been buying and stockpiling oil 
in huge Gulf Coast salt domes, insurance against the day when another cutback 
in foreign-oil supplies could threaten the nation's economic well-being. So 
far, more than $19 billion has been spent to store 580 million barrels in the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Bush Administration, mainly for budgetary reasons, proposes to cap the 
reserve at 750 million barrels. Influential members of Congress, though, say 
that national security requires a 1-billion barrel stockpile. Who's right? In 
this case, a prudent respect for international uncertainties argues for a 
billion-barrel reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the 1970s, when the global economy was rocked by two major oil shocks, 
the major industrialized nations agreed that each would stockpile reserves 
equal to 90 days of oil imports. Currently, though, the U.S. reserve, once at 
118 days of imports, has slipped to an equivalent of only 81 days of reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The problem isn't so much that total U.S. petroleum demand has been rising but 
that domestic oil production has steeply declined, leaving Americans dependent 
on overseas suppliers for close to 50% of the oil they consume. That has shrunk 
the strategic reserve's replacement capability. It has also increased the 
economy's vulnerability to supply interruptions from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve is a political asset as well as an economic one. It acts as a 
disincentive to such deliberate cuts in foreign oil deliveries as the Arab oil 
embargo of 1973-74. 
</P>
<P>
It also should serve to calm potential market panics if production losses due 
to chaotic local conditions, like the trauma of the 1979 Iranian revolution, 
recur. Americans shouldn't forget that it took years to recover from the 
economic damage of the huge price hikes that the loss of Iranian oil 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
A billion-barrel reserve -- built up at a time when oil prices are still 
relatively low -- would be comparatively cheap insurance against an uncertain 
future.

ANIMALS OR HUMANS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let us assert a proposition that is, in the current context, rather heretical: 
To save the life of the lowliest child fated to live in the meanest 
circumstances in the most backward village in the furthest reaches of 
Bangladesh, we would countenance -- regretfully, perhaps even tearfully -- the 
death of any animal from hamster to great whale. 
</P>
<P>
Scant years ago, a person who believed otherwise would have been thought 
callous or, perhaps, unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
But fashionable ideas, like fashionable clothes, defy rational analysis. Take, 
for example, the case of the animal-rights movement. Its handful of hot-eyed 
adherents currently are subjecting the nation's medical research institutions 
to their annual week of harassment and, in some cases, physical intimidation. 
Their purpose is to force a halt to the use of animals in medical research. 
</P>
<P>
No living thing ought to be misused or mistreated. However, the twisting of 
this humane and inarguable admonition into a prohibition on the use of animals 
in legitimate medical research is absurd reductionism. It dulls moral reasoning 
into an instrument incapable of making mature distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
Modern medicine is one of our civilization's great engines of practical 
liberation. Pain and disease are forms of oppression. Millions of our fellow 
human beings have been freed of their burden by medical research. The arrogant 
cant of unthinking zealots must not obstruct this selfless enterprise.

Casual observers of Israeli politics must find this baffling: Two elderly 
rabbis -- one has never set foot in Israel, neither has held political office 
-- have prevented Shimon Peres from forming a government and pursuing the peace 
process with the Palestinians. Even more baffling is that the two rabbis, Rabbi 
Shach, 93, and Rabbi Schneerson, 88, hold diametrically opposite views on the 
peace process and have been bitter enemies for years. What unites them, 
paradoxically, is their condemnation of Zionism and aversion to the Labor 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the two sages' power is, of course, the influence they wield over 
Israel's ultra-orthodox Jewish political parties. Holding 13 of 120 Knesset 
seats, these parties are crucial for the formation of Israel's next coalition 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Shach, head of the Ponivezh yeshiva, is the spiritual leader of two 
political parties: the mostly Sephardic Shas, with six seats in the Knesset, 
and the Ashkenazi Torah Flag, with two. Rabbi Schneerson -- the Lubavitcher 
Rebbe -- heads the Brooklyn-based Hasidic sect of Chabad. In the 1988 Israeli 
elections, Schneerson supported the third ultra-orthodox party, Agudat Yisrael, 
which helped it increase its Knesset membership from two to five seats. 
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis would like to diminish the orthodox parties' power by changing 
the electoral system. One of the two major parties, Labor or Likud, would then 
be better able to govern effectively. Changing the political rules, however, 
would not do away with the fundamental social reality that underlies the 
current political deadlock: Israeli society is deeply divided over the 
definition of its own collective identity. 
</P>
<P>
When it was founded at the end of the 19th Century, the Zionist movement aimed 
to present a secular, national alternative to the traditional Jewish way of 
life. But to appeal to the Jewish masses, particularly in Eastern Europe, 
Zionism had to borrow its symbols from traditional Jewish culture. Thus, the 
Star of David, the menorah, the idea of aliyah (pilgrimage) to Zion and many 
other religious symbols were infused with a secular and national content. 
</P>
<P>
While borrowing the symbols of traditional Judaism, Zionism could not ignore 
the religious institutions that still commanded the allegiance of the vast 
majority of Jews. Since orthodox Jewry was largely anti-Zionist, orthodox 
groups willing to cooperate with the Zionist movement were granted a privileged 
status within it. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1930s, the Labor Zionist movement was the dominant force in Zionism. 
It carried on the policy of trying to accommodate the representatives of 
orthodox Jewry, and for the same reasons. Thus, when the Israeli government 
under Ben Gurion nationalized Israel's schools in the early 1950s, only two of 
the previously existing systems were allowed to continued to operate: the 
independent system of Agudat Yisrael and one under the de-facto control of the 
National Religious Party. 
</P>
<P>
The religious school systems, and a whole network of state-subsidized yeshivot 
(many of whose students have been exempt from mandatory military service) have 
been promoting a principle of collective identity based exclusively on Jewish 
ethnicity. According to this principle, the only meaningful political 
distinction is that between Jews and non-Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, official Israeli identity as defined by the state is much more 
ambiguous. While Israel is considered, by law, to be a Jewish state, Israeli 
citizenship rights can be enjoyed by non-Jews as well. Thus, the 18% of Israeli 
citizens who are Arab are supposed to have all the rights and privileges 
accorded to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The clash between these two principles of identity is evident now in Jerusalem, 
where Jewish settlers, at the behest of government officials, have been living 
in the Christian quarter since Easter week. Israel's Supreme Court Thursday 
ordered them evicted. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Jewish principle of identity has been gaining ground, for 
two important reasons: The continuation and increasing intensity of the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict have resulted in greater solidarity among Jews and 
greater hostility toward Arabs; and Sephardic Jews, who have been economically, 
politically and culturally barred from the mainstream of Israeli society, have 
responded to this exclusion by reasserting their Jewish identity. 
</P>
<P>
Disaffected Sephardic Jews have flocked to Likud, the former opposition. As a 
result, the party, whose leadership is no more religiously observant than 
Labor's, has become, through its rank-and-file members, the chief carrier of 
the Jewish principle of identity. 
</P>
<P>
What distances the religious parties from Labor and unites them with Likud, 
then, is a much deeper schism than the ones usually recognized in Israeli 
politics. It has to do with the very definition of the society's collective 
identity. It transcends such issues as territories vs. peace, Sephardi vs. 
Ashkenazi, Zionist vs. non-Zionist. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rabbi Shach has frequently stated his preference for peace over 
territory, he has instructed his disciples not to form a coalition with Peres. 
In doing so, he alluded to the Labor Zionist movement's historical disdain for 
traditional Jewish values. Similarly, Agudat Yisrael, which initially supported 
Peres, insisted that he forge a majority among Jewish members of the Knesset. 
When this proved impossible, given Rabbi Shach's position, Peres' efforts to 
form a Labor-led government were doomed. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli electorate is about equally divided between a Likud-led and a 
Labor-led bloc, with an additional 15% supporting religious parties. If the 
strength of religious parties is reduced through electoral reform, this will 
not break the deadlock between Labor and Likud. Even if an American-style 
presidential system is introduced, the president will still have to work with a 
deadlocked Knesset, which would prove an impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis must decide whether they want to live in an open, democratic and 
forward-looking society, or whether they want a Jewish ghetto to be 
reconstructed in the Middle East. Until this decision is made, the political 
deadlock will continue. And no amount of political or electoral manipulation 
can change this reality.

THESE BOOTS ARE MADE TO AID WALKING; 
</P>
<P>
DISABLED: LONG BEACH VA HOSPITAL IS AMONG SEVEN IN THE NATION TO TEST $4,000 
FOOTWEAR THAT HELPS PARALYZED PATIENTS WALK AGAIN.

Andy Ripchick recently stood up for the first time in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It changes your perspective," said Ripchick, 52, who has been in a wheelchair 
since an automobile accident paralyzed him in 1955. "You can look people in the 
eye and feel better about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The experience was made possible by a new pair of boots called the 
Vanini-Rizzoli Stabilizing Orthosis. Doctors consider them a major breakthrough 
for people with spinal cord injuries who, until now, have experienced the world 
primarily from a sitting position. 
</P>
<P>
"The patients are ecstatic," said Gabriel Perez, a spokesman for the Veterans 
Affairs Medical Center of Long Beach, where Ripchick and 21 other patients are 
involved in a two-year test of the seemingly simple new equipment that could 
radically change their lives. "This is the first time in years that some of 
them have been on their feet and able to see above waist level." 
</P>
<P>
Custom designed and manufactured in Italy at a cost of $4,000 per pair, the 
knee-high brown and black leather boots operate on a simple principle. By 
locking the ankle joints into standing position, doctors say, the boots 
automatically stabilize a wearer's knees when he or she stands. Thus by 
shifting their upper body slightly to the left, right or forward, most patients 
are able to walk, and in some cases even climb stairs, with the aid of parallel 
bars, a walker or a special set of canes. 
</P>
<P>
Some wheelchair-bound patients have been able to walk with leg braces for some 
time, of course. But the braces are cumbersome, extending from the ankles to 
the hips and weighing 30 to 40 pounds, said Dr. Herbert Kent, the hospital's 
chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation. Most patients need help in 
getting them on. And because of the severity of their injuries, he said, some 
patients are unable to use the braces at all. 
</P>
<P>
The boots weigh 2 1/2 pounds each, extend only to the knee and can be used by 
about 15% more patients than the braces, Kent said. Developed at a hospital in 
Imola, Italy, they have been tried on about 1,500 patients in that country, 
according to Kent. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach VA hospital is one of only seven in the nation, and the only one 
in California, designated by the federal government to test the boots' 
effectiveness by outfitting selected patients with them and monitoring their 
progress through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Those selected are then subjected to a rigorous training program lasting six to 
eight weeks, during which their upper bodies are strengthened through exercise 
and they are instructed in the boots' use. The custom-fitted boots are ordered 
from Italy at the government's expense. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 22 patients in the program, the majority live at home and come to the 
hospital periodically for training, observation and practice, Kent said. He 
said the medical center hopes to enlist at least 13 more for the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tremendous," said Gilbert L. Garcia, 60, who has been in a wheelchair 
for 13 months because of a suspected clot in his spinal column. "I'm doing 
things I never thought I'd be doing again; this will open a lot more avenues." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Anselmi, 42, a Vietnam veteran who was injured by a piece of shrapnel in 
1969, was somewhat more reserved in his assessment of the new boots. "I 
appreciate it," he said, "but it's not like walking. It isn't a healing. It's a 
bio-mechanical process that allows you to take some steps." 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Jacobs, a 54-year-old accident victim who has been paralyzed for 24 
years, seemed primarily attuned to the novelty of the situation during a recent 
practice session on the parallel bars. "The best thing is that you get to 
brag," he quipped. "How many people do you know who wear a $4,000 pair of 
Italian leather boots?"

OFFICIAL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE CHARITY RAFFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell has taken action to aid a private Catholic high 
school in Oxnard that canceled its annual raffle recently after the Ventura 
County district attorney's office declared it a violation of state gambling 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
In response to an outcry from parents and school officials, O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria) introduced legislation that would place on the November ballot 
an amendment to the state Constitution that would allow nonprofit and 
charitable groups to operate raffles. 
</P>
<P>
The school's spring fiesta raffle, held for 20 years at Santa Clara High 
School, was scrapped after Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory W. Brose wrote April 4 
that it violated state gambling laws. 
</P>
<P>
The raffle had raised up to $60,000 each year for the school, according to 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office issued a formal opinion in April, 1988, 
concluding that charitable organizations may not legally use a raffle to raise 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution, which can be amended only by voters, prohibits raffles and 
lotteries that distribute prizes to participants who make donations or pay to 
participate. Exceptions, such as the state Lottery and bingo for charitable 
groups, were approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
However, O'Connell may have his work cut out for him. Two previous attempts to 
adopt similar legislation have failed, one in 1988 by Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) and another in 1989 by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier 
(D-South San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Joe Yocca, an administrative assistant to McClintock, said both were passed by 
the Assembly but killed in a state Senate committee at the behest of law 
enforcement officials who feared that the legislation would allow organized 
crime to profit from such raffles. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said recently that he helped draft the 
legislation sponsored by McClintock and would support any effort to allow 
charitable organizations to continue to raise funds.

JAKE'S SOUTH BAY DOES THE BEACH TRADITION PROUD, THE RICE PILAF POORLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someday, some scholar of immense erudition and rare insight is going to write a 
study of the California beach restaurant, and, when that happens, the new 
Jake's South Bay on the Chula Vista waterfront will very possibly be included 
as a highly refined, late-20th-Century example of this unique style of eatery. 
</P>
<P>
The last California beach restaurant, whenever and wherever it may be built, 
will not only offer the unique rice preparation that these places, and these 
alone, are pleased to call "rice pilaf," but also the beloved filet 
mignon/frozen lobster tail combination that is usually garnished with it. 
Jake's offers these requisite specialties, along with a primarily seafood menu 
that does include a few meat offerings. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a unique style of service specific to the California beach 
restaurant, and, if the busboys at Jake's aren't quite the surfer dudes of 
yesteryear, they at least give a fair imitation. Their service is at times a 
fascinating combination of cheerful good intentions absolutely unguided by any 
sense of how to bus a table. 
</P>
<P>
The waitresses do somewhat better, but also seem quite at sea at certain 
crucial moments. Even so, there is nonetheless a charm to the service that 
could never be duplicated by haughty, French-trained, professional waiters. 
</P>
<P>
Jake's opened in late December and is owned by TS Restaurants, which also owns 
Jake's Del Mar and Charlie's in Cardiff. There is a good, solid beach 
restaurant tradition here, since TS co-founder Sandy Saxten started his career 
in 1966 as a waiter at Chuck's Steak House in Hawaii and now presides over a 
sizable chain of places in Southern California, Hawaii and Lake Tahoe. All are 
within a stone's throw of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Some recipes repeat from place to place, and guests at Jake's South Bay 
generally enjoy a good price break; for example, the dish of scallops with 
macadamias that costs $9.95 in Chula Vista runs $14.95 at the chain's Kapalua 
Bar &amp; Grill on Maui. 
</P>
<P>
Appetizers are few and in the beach mode, and include such things as a steamed 
artichoke, ceviche, shrimp cocktail, raw oysters and a less-typical batch of 
grilled oysters, which take on a distinct and rather pleasant flavor from the 
charcoal grill. They arrive doused with some sort of inept butter sauce that 
seems, at heart, to want to be a French beurre blanc, but, because the sauce 
slips right off the bivalves, no harm is done. 
</P>
<P>
The menu also includes a brief, inexpensive "cafe" section that is rare for 
this sort of place but quite welcome. The offerings here run to a steak 
sandwich; a chicken sandwich that, for better or worse, is seasoned with Cajun 
spices; a fairly dressy cheeseburger; a seafood salad, and what the menu calls 
a "gourmet" pizza, which is decorated with chorizo, onions, olives, mushrooms 
and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Meals also include the choice of clam chowder or what is described as "house" 
Caesar salad, which means a fairly good if rather dry imitation of the real 
thing. It is pleasant and generously served, as is the chowder, a creamed soup 
thick with potatoes, bacon, celery and clams that tilts a touch to the peppery 
side and is finished with a little thyme, which only lately has become 
traditional in chowder but certainly heightens the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The entree list opens with a few daily seafood specials -- the more extravagant 
offerings, such as salmon and Maine lobster, appear here -- and proceeds 
directly to the "fresh fish Cajun style," a dish that certainly would have been 
a California beach restaurant classic if ersatz Cajun cooking had not been 
invented so long after the advent of beach restaurants. A second offering that 
also utilizes whatever fresh fish the kitchen has in plenitude on any given day 
is the "fresh fish Veracruz," which finishes the chosen poisson with tomato 
sauce spiked with garlic, jalapeno peppers and green olives. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner list continues with scampi, one of the three true icons of beach 
cooking and a dish that, like rice pilaf and steak and lobster, certainly has a 
devoted and almost devout following. Scampi is one of the few dishes that seems 
to taste exactly the same everywhere (the white wine, butter and garlic that 
flavor the dish are not subject to the slightest modification), and anyone who 
has enjoyed this dish elsewhere will like it at Jake's. The portion, however, 
consists of just five medium-size shrimp, which makes this a rather skimpy 
scampi. 
</P>
<P>
It is de rigueur to have rice pilaf with this (although the steak fries are a 
great deal more satisfactory), and the rice is every bit as gooey and 
indifferently flavored as the Beach Restaurant Master Recipe dictates. There 
must be a school somewhere that teaches beginning beach cooks how to prepare 
this unique, stewed rice. 
</P>
<P>
The scallops macadamia actually are breaded and browned, and the nut flavor 
seems mostly in the breading, which is a good place for it. This is a good dish 
and a tasty one, even if it is swimming in the same indeterminate butter sauce 
that dressed the grilled oysters. Because this sauce has virtually no flavor or 
body, it has little effect on the dish. 
</P>
<P>
The menu takes a slightly Italian note with such dishes as the shrimp and 
chicken piccata (the sauce includes capers and white wine); the seafood 
pescatore, or fettuccine topped with fish and shellfish in a cheese-enriched 
white sauce, and cioppino, a typical offering of seafood cooked in broth-based 
tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Among meat offerings, there is a New York sirloin in a choice of green 
peppercorn or blue cheese sauces (both something of a departure from the menu's 
general tone); chicken breast marinated in gingered soy sauce, and a platter of 
marinated, grilled New Zealand chops. At $17.95, the lamb is one of the most 
extravagant offerings, but the order sampled was extravagantly portioned, 
well-cooked and of good quality. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts are of the simplest sort imaginable. The choice includes creme caramel 
and chocolate mousse and, at its most imaginative, a TS Restaurants chainwide 
special called Kimo's Hula Pie that consists of high-rising ice cream layered 
in a cookie crust. Jake's serves a lot of it. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant takes full advantage of its handsome waterfront setting and of 
the sweeping views across the bay to the Silver Strand and Point Loma. The 
place is built in the style of a turn-of-the-century boathouse, with a 
multitude of historic waterfront photos on the walls and peaked ceilings of 
rough-sawn wood whose loft spaces accommodate hanging skiffs and dories.

Please be assured that just because I care for the rights, protection and 
welfare of animals does not mean I do not also care for the rights, protection

</P>
<P>
I do, and so do all the persons in the animal arena I know personally.

<P>
Please, do not invalidate our efforts or demean them because animals are on our

treatment of animals that is at question: It is man's behavior (or misbehavior) 
that is the crux of our concern.

Q: I will be attending several formal events this spring and need a new evening 
gown. What's new, and right for a 5-foot-6 38-year-old? I wear a 38-C bra so 
don't suggest a strapless dress or one with a bustier as they only accentuate 
my big bosom. 
</P>
<P>
 -- P.A.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: But that's what you're supposed to do this season. The most up-to-the-minute 
look for evening is the hourglass figure. After years of exile, curves are once 
more fashionable. It's a look right out of "Dangerous Liaisons" and one given a 
big push -- and push-up -- by Paris designer Yves Saint Laurent (illustrated 
here) in his latest haute couture collection. It could be the first fashion 
trend ever inspired by plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't feel comfortable in a bustier or strapless gown, look for one with 
a scooped-out neckline. MARYLOU LUTHER

Have you seen "The Guys?" They're little face sculptures by L.A. 
artist-turned-jewelry designer Robert Lahaye. In brushed gold or antiqued 
silver with tie-tack backs, they are seen in the best company. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Jackson wears them all over a vest in her "Miss You Much" music video. 
They cover a bustier worn by Gloria Estefan. But "The Guys," with names like 
Tiki, Spike, Ziggy and Razor, aren't just for girls. Rod Stewart wears all 
seven of them on his lapel. The collection of tiny faces, each less than an 
inch wide or an inch high, looks good grouped together on a jacket shoulder. 
Individually the pins can be tie-tacks or lapel pins. Each one is signed by the 
artist. At $25, they are a way to begin collecting Lahaye art. They are 
available at Ice in the Beverly Center and at Fred Segal, Santa Monica. JOANNA

Steichen Heirs vs. Museum: The heirs of photography pioneer Edward Steichen, 
longtime benefactors to New York's Museum of Modern Art, are battling the 
museum over an $800,000 Henri Matisse painting that was bequeathed to the 
photographer's 6-year-old great-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The painting was loaned to the museum in 1973 by Steichen's youngest daughter, 
Kate. But although she left it in her will to her grandniece, museum officials 
are refusing to give it back, saying it was meant as a permanent gift. The 
painting has been in the photography pioneer's family since Matisse gave it to 
him in 1908. GREG BRAXTON

Though long one of the most popular rappers, M. C. Hammer was primarily known 
only in rap circles until this breakthrough album, "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 
'Em" -- No. 4 on the Billboard chart -- finally introduced him to the pop 
mainstream. Controversy is certainly helping Public Enemy's "Fear of a Black 
Planet," which vaulted to No. 19 in just two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On the heavy-metal circuit, Slaughter's "Stick it to Ya" (No. 21) and Damn 
Yankees' "Damn Yankees" (No. 41) are the fast-rising newcomers. The "Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles" sound track (No. 31) is zooming up the chart. So is 
Fleetwood Mac's "Behind the Mask" (No. 30). 
</P>
<P>
* Heart probably takes more heat from critics than any major pop-rock group. 
"Brigade" isn't a critical favorite, but it's No. 8 after just three weeks on 
the chart.

'Prelude' Not Burned Out: A New York preview performance of "Prelude to a 
Kiss," starring Timothy Hutton, went on as scheduled Thursday night after an 
early morning fire in the dressing rooms of the Helen Hayes Theatre destroyed 
the majority of the costumes for the play, which is scheduled to make its 
Broadway debut Tuesday. A production spokesman said new costumes and dressing 
room arrangements were hurriedly prepared during the day, and that all the 
theaters on West 44th Street, where the Hayes is located, volunteered washing 
and drying machines in an attempt to save the 90 costumes used in the show. The 
cause of the fire was not immediately determined. GREG BRAXTON

Phantom Phallout: That $74,500 total for three pairs of tickets sold at auction 
to Michael Crawford's final Sunday matinee of "The Phantom of the Opera," had 
shrunk by noon Thursday, when some of the high bidders in Wednesday's KABC 
Channel 7's "A.M. Los Angeles" auction -- notably the second runner-up, at 
$26,000 -- had second thoughts and went phfffffft. 
</P>
<P>
The top bidder's check for $27,500 and the next highest for $21,000 were in by 
the deadline. The third runner-up came in at $7,500. Proceeds are destined for 
a pair of charities: Para Los Ninos and Equity Fights AIDS. GREG BRAXTON

Following are the Times' recommendations for today's schedule of the American 
Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with commentary by the 
film-reviewing staff. Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000. 
</P>
<P>
Highly recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"Pictures of the Old World"(Czechoslovakia; Director: Dusan Hanak; Cineplex 
Odeon Fairfax, 11:30 p.m.). Hanak's documentary of peasant life in the Slovak 
region -- banned for 17 years by the old regime -- has some of the limpid, 
overpowering beauty James Agee and Walker Evans achieved in "Let Us Now Praise 
Famous Men." The images are monochrome, dappled with light and shadow, the 
faces old and weathered. The tales, simple and sturdy, tell of hard lives and 
quiet endurance. A great, sad, wonderful film, one to be seen and cherished. 
</P>
<P>
"Landscape in the Mist"(Greece; Director: Theo Angelopoulos; Cineplex Odeon 
Century Plaza, 9:30 p.m.). Seemingly the simplest of Angelopoulos' stories: Two 
runaway children journey over highways and railroads through a dreamy, desolate 
Greece in search of their mythological father. All the director's work echoes 
through it; even the Traveling Players reappear. This film, winner of the top 
prize at the 1989 European Film Awards, is a modern masterpiece; no movie lover 
should miss it. (Critic's Choice, with The Times' Michael Wilmington.) 
</P>
<P>
"The Beekeeper"(Greece; Director: Theo Angelopoulos; Century Plaza, 11:15 
p.m.). Like all Angelopoulos' work, this contemporary road movie is hauntingly 
sad, mysteriously beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"Monday Morning"(Bulgaria; Directors: Irina Aktasheva, Hristo Piskov; Fairfax, 
7 p.m.). Another long-banned film, this comic drama about a shipyard crew 
chief's romance with a delinquent girl has the vibrancy and spirit of the 
better '60s Italian and British comedies. 
</P>
<P>
"Def by Temptation"(U.S.; Director: James Bond III; Century Plaza, 7 p.m.). Two 
veterans of Spike Lee's "School Daze" -- cinematographer Ernest Dickerson and 
actor and now writer-director Bond -- whip up a potent little horror-fantasy 
about a rapacious vampire and a young man of the Lord. Probably the best movie 
ever released by the defiantly sleazy Troma Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The Long Way Home"(U.S.; Director: Michael Apted; Goodson, 7 p.m.). A 
priceless subject revealed with dispassionate skill: East meets West with the 
Leningrad rock band Aquarium. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

MOVIE REVIEW;

<P>
A WORLD OF MIXED-UP MEDIA IN EGOYAN'S 'SPEAKING PARTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Atom Egoyan's "Speaking Parts" (at the Monica 4-Plex), people don't touch; 
they watch each other on video. 
</P>
<P>
The ideas suggest Steve Soderbergh's "sex, lies, and videotape," but here, 
Egoyan carries them further. Lost in a strange metallic world of hotel 
corridors, universal TV hookups and conference rooms, video stores and empty 
boudoirs, his characters struggle soporifically in a voyeuristic web. Orgies 
are filmed; even a local cemetery has a mausoleum stocked with video screens 
and tapes of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
It's a viscid, gelatinously shiny realm in which all movement is gluey and 
detached, in which the only on-screen sex occurs through a video-phone hookup. 
Every scene is darkened, as if to accommodate a TV set. Characters watch each 
other and themselves on VCRs and, when they dream, they start hallucinating 
about video images that are watching them back. 
</P>
<P>
For Soderbergh, videotape could filter out lies; for Egoyan, it breeds them. 
The movie's paragon of evil is a producer-director (David Hemblen) who destroys 
the genuine emotion in the script he's bought by insisting on a spurious TV 
talk show scene. He's a malign talking head on huge screen hookups, dictating 
and destroying by remote control. Through this electronic maze, no one feels or 
really touches until the very last second -- and that moment is played more 
like a melancholy coda to a portrait of a world gone askew. 
</P>
<P>
Faking it is part of the film's subject, also the trap into which it 
occasionally falls. In interviews, Egoyan -- like Soderbergh, a great favorite 
of Wim Wenders -- has criticized the "misuse" of film or video as "instruments 
to enshrine sentiment," and said: "Nothing is more artificial than traditional 
realism." Yet enshrining sentiment -- sentimentality, actually -- is exactly 
what he's used his instruments for here. And his spare, flashily cryptic 
dialogue is closer to the artificiality of bad movie naturalism than to the 
high allusive literacy he probably wants. 
</P>
<P>
Egoyan's style is too cool and detached to appear overtly sentimental, but his 
material is impregnated with a kind of syrupy self-pity: pared-down soap opera. 
A very bad commercial TV-movie could have emerged from "Speaking Parts' " plot 
line. The discarded writer is a woman, Clara -- played with fine, naked-nerve 
emotionalism by Gabrielle Rose -- whose brother died after saving her life with 
a lung transplant. Clara replaces him with a young actor, Lance (Michael 
McManus), whom she hires to play the brother in her teleplay; Lance is a hotel 
employee adored from afar by a young chambermaid (Egoyan's girlfriend, Arsine 
Khanjian), who collects all his non-speaking parts on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
The women feel and respond; the men are cold voyeurs. And all of them -- these 
beautiful youngsters wandering disconsolately through corridors of dread in the 
post-video emotional holocaust -- are ruled by a Big Video Daddy and Mama: the 
producer and the hotel head housekeeper. This whole idea is deeply sentimental. 
And since Egoyan seems prey to the same vices he attacks -- or, more 
accurately, nibbles at -- one wonders if the manipulative, detached video store 
owner (played by Tony Nardi, who suggests a younger Peter Coyote) is an ironic 
self-portrait. In the end, "Parts" seems a narcissistic movie. It may be only 
partial self-kidding that Egoyan's company is called Ego Film Arts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Still and all, "Speaking Parts" (Times-rated Mature for partial nudity, video 
sex and language) is subtle, thoughtful stuff for serious filmgoers. It's full 
of ideas, disturbing metaphors for today's society, and it's subtly made by a 
promising filmmaker with an intelligent vision. It's also a drowsy, despairing 
film, in which we and the characters seem to be viewing everything through the 
other side of an aquarium wall. Egoyan builds up to a paroxysm in which every 
kind of film or video stock is intercut wildly together: an orgasm of mixed 
media. But, though Egoyan's characters may never crystallize into flesh and 
blood, that's part of his point. Video sex is the crucial coupling in his 
vague, nightmare world, the deadly climax of the Video Age.

STAGE BEAT: CARRICO'S 'TWO MEN OUT' HITS HOME AT THEATRE EXCHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You expect first plays to err on the side of personal indulgence, especially 
when the subject matter involves booze and the family. But you seldom see a 
playwright's maiden effort sliced into the vigorous shape of Tom Carrico's "Two 
Men Out, Runner on Third" at Theatre Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
This four-character drama, in which a grieving father and one of his two sons 
drink themselves into an ugly stupor over a two-day drunk, is an uncompromising 
X-ray of a self-destructive family in which booze pours like water from the 
family well. 
</P>
<P>
The title signals the dilemma: The old man and one son have already been tagged 
out but there's a runner on third, the younger baseball-playing son, who's 
fighting to break away with his identity intact. The result is a strong first 
play by Carrico, notable for the force of its dialogue and a sculptured 
dramatic structure that avoids melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst for the gathering storm is the death of the mother, whom we never 
see but whose presence as the long-suffering spouse hovers over this warring 
household. There are glimmers of Arthur Miller in the festering father-son 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Director Neal Weaver expertly guides his players through their beer-and-Jim 
Beam-drenched odyssey. In the early part of the mother's wake, you hardly 
notice the presence of alcohol in the family living room (a perfectly modest, 
tacky abode designed by Michael Larkins). Nobody's falling down drunk, but then 
-- with a start -- you catch the understated image of the father's pants, which 
have become wet with urine. Characters don't ruminate about the bottle. 
Drinking is a given. 
</P>
<P>
As the father, Jim Kier deftly portrays a confused, possessive dad trying to 
hang on to his last son by ridiculing the boy's dreams of being a ballplayer. 
That youth, the hope of the play and seemingly the playwright's alter ego, is 
rendered with a fervent, lyrical touch by Bill Conroy. As the other son, an 
alcoholic lawyer, Tom Willet imperceptibly segues from sobriety to oblivion, 
passing out in a trash bin. A minor character, a baseball scout played by 
William Barker, jauntily enlivens the action. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11855 Hart St., North Hollywood; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
Sundays, 3 p.m.; through May 12. $10. (213) 876-2236.

<P>
Early Vietnam-Era Drama of 'The Watering Place' 
</P>
<P>
The home as a battlefield is also the dark subject of "The Watering Place" at 
the Powerhouse, a production notable for vivid direction by Dallas Vogeler and 
a scabrous, pugnacious performance by George Murdock, who has a roaring time 
telling a Vietnam vet that "war isn't war unless you're killing Krauts." 
</P>
<P>
This early Vietnam-era play, which dramatizes a soldier's visit to his dead 
buddy's neurotic family, opened and closed after one performance on Broadway in 
1969. Though writer Lyle ("Orphans") Kessler has revised and cut it, it's 
watchable primarily because of a strong cast. 
</P>
<P>
The theme that war is bred in the home seems pretentious, and there's no 
character to root for. Bobbi Holtzman's demented mother, Chris DeMartino's 
self-serving Vietnam vet and Shannon Lee Avnsoe's sexually accommodating, 
widowed sister-in-law are too insular to reflect any condition of 1960s 
America, let alone Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
There's something macabre about the production, however, as if Harold Pinter 
were paying a visit to "The Addams Family." Murdock has a field day, and 
production values, notably Patty Klawonn's domestic set design, are first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica; Thursdays through Saturdays; 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 
p.m.; through May 27. $12-$14. (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
A Gathering of U.S. Expatriates in 'Hotel' 
</P>
<P>
The 60th anniversary production of Philip Barry's seldom-staged "lost 
generation" play, "Hotel Universe," is a fragile, beguiling experience at the 
Shepard Theatre Complex. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's drama of expatriate Americans gathered at a villa in the South of 
France was based on his friendship with Gerald and Sarah Murphy and their 
glittering life at Cap d'Antibes in the 1920s (the same setting that inspired 
F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Tender Is the Night"). So it is an unusual pleasure to 
run into a production that dares tackle this bubble of a world on its own 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
Freud was big in 1930, when the play opened on Broadway, and Barry dappled his 
eight characters, their post-World War faiths shaken, in psychological and even 
metaphysical analysis as they glide in angst about the starry terrace (a classy 
design by David G. Monroe). 
</P>
<P>
Director J. P. Duffy has a keen ear and eye for the work's delicate tone and 
most of the actors, coiffed and costumed in Flapper detail, capture the 
requisite soul-searching without hamming it up. Plays about the jaded rich are 
hard to do today. Especially convincing are Jo Ann Nelson, Paul Carter, M. J. 
Clemens, Addy Allison and Kilroy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6474 Santa Monica Blvd.; Friday, Saturday, 8 p.m.; closes Sunday, 8 p.m. 
$15. (213) 466-1767.

Drama of Graffiti Artist in CalArts 'Fall' 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, productions from the CalArts theater department would make periodic 
sorties to Los Angeles, and it was always interesting to see what that campus 
was theatrically up to. Now we have CalArts once removed in "Fall" at the 
Matrix, an agonizing drama of an L.A. graffiti artist, with all the key 
creative hands recent CalArts graduates. 
</P>
<P>
The group, playwright Geoffrey Thorne, director Douglas Rushkoff, star Morgan 
Rusler, and set designer Alexandra Rubinstein, captures an L.A. artistic 
subculture rife with raw energy and frayed nerves. 
</P>
<P>
The downside is the overripe tone, the loose shape, the strident drunken 
bellowings of the artist-in-crisis (Rusler), and the failure of the otherwise 
gritty production, set in a dim loft, to marshal the relationships and the 
plot's lovesick angle into an artful structure. But there's a definable world 
presented here, and the promise of this group is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7657 Melrose Ave.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m.; 
through May 26. $15. (213) 852-1445.

'Eros at Twilight' at Burbage Theatre 
</P>
<P>
The numbing babble of gab in Jaime Meyer's fanciful comedy "Eros at Twilight," 
at the Burbage Theatre Ensemble, is a grueling ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's idea about a man and woman (John Achorn and Melissa Converse) living in 
an abandoned lighthouse and searching for their Muses isn't bad. And a couple 
of supporting turns are flavorful (Burke Byrnes' Sterling Hayden-like 
adventurer and Susan Rome's waitress-turned-mermaid). But the ramshackle 
production, the repetitious talk, director Gary Guidinger's lack of buoyancy 
and frantic, inane pacing are distracting to the point of oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from all this, the Burbage might consider a scrub down. It's one of the 
drearier theaters in town. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2330 Sawtelle Blvd.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8:30 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 
p.m.; through June 10. $12-$14. (213) 478-0897. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Post-Apocalyptic 'Strange Voyage' 
</P>
<P>
Another exhausting play in another dreary venue, the Century City Playhouse, is 
the Burbage Theatre Ensemble's Bare Bones production of a post-apocalyptic 
tragicomedy in two unrelenting acts called "Strange Voyage." 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Nitza Henig's painful variation on "Waiting for Godot" is a test of 
the mettle of director Frederick Johntz. He can't salvage this overwrought show 
but he cajoles some fetching Laurel and Hardy touches from performers Neal 
Lerner and Joseph McCarthy, who give the term "trouper" new meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue becomes unbearable, by turns giddy and turgid and mind-bending. 
That's eternity in the desert for you. The wasteland is briefly enlivened by a 
couple of screechy strangers (Louise Bitcon and Gail Shapiro). The world's mad 
-- do you hear? Mad. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10508 W. Pico Blvd., Monday through Wednesday, 8 p.m., through May 2. $5. 
(213) 839-3322.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: CROSS SECTION OF ASIAN DELIGHTS AT KIM TAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When newspaper editorials talk about Los Angeles as the new melting pot, East 
Hollywood must be what they have in mind, an agglomeration of more 
nationalities than ever competed in the World Cup or signed a nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty. 
</P>
<P>
You might find a Colombian grocery, a Romanian dry cleaners, a Cambodian 
doughnut shop in the same mini-mall; the owner of a restaurant might be 
conversant in Armenian, Arabic, Spanish and Thai. You can buy a jar of beans or 
a soft-porn videocassette from practically any country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
On the fringe of this community of strangers is Kim Tar, an expanded barbecue 
stand specializing in the foods of the Chiu Chow -- the East's ultimate 
strangers. These are the ethnic Chinese who migrated from North China to 
Southeast Asia dozens of generations ago, and their cuisine, at least here, 
seems a true hybrid: classic Cantonese-style dishes inflected with the exotic 
fruits and pungent fermented sauces of Thailand. Kim Tar's menu is printed in 
Thai and Vietnamese in addition to the usual Chinese and English, you can 
choose between Chinese black tea and Thai red tea, and the tables are set with 
both cruets of Chinese soy and Thai fish sauces. Customers talk to each other 
in Cantonese, eat everything but noodles with fork and spoon rather than 
chopsticks, and bring in bags of the sweet Thai fruit durian from the Bangkok 
Market across the street. Half the dishes are studded with what look like 
sesame seeds but are in fact confetti of minced garlic. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the menu is devoted to the usual stir-fries: clams with black-bean 
sauce, beef in sate sauce, volcano chicken. These are done as well, if not as 
cheaply, at any Westside Chinese restaurant. You'd do better to order steamed 
fish in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the really good stuff is listed toward the beginning of the menu under 
the heading "Dishes." There's anise-scented beef stew, similar to a Cantonese 
beef stew spiked with an extra wallop of fish sauce, irresistible if you like 
the slithery texture of long-cooked tendon. Kim Tar also serves the best 
Chinese barbecued pork this side of Monterey Park, sweet and full of juice. 
Anybody would like crisp fried dumplings stuffed with fragrant sauteed leeks; 
tiny taro egg rolls the size of a baby's thumb; delicious roast duck and 
barbecued spareribs. It's also safe to say that Kim Tar is the place in East 
Hollywood to come if you're looking for salted pig's intestines, pig's kidney 
hot pot or a party-size portion of soft, young pig, which you're probably not. 
</P>
<P>
If they could work up the guts, everybody would like the fried pig's intestine. 
(We can't vouch for the salted pig's intestine, or the intestine with preserved 
vegetables, or the kishke noodles, though.) The crunchy little rounds of 
bias-cut entrails, deep-fried and looking something like cut figs on the plate, 
have something of the clean richness of slab bacon, not the musky horror you 
might imagine. If you didn't know what they were, you might gobble them like 
pork rinds; if your spouse made you try them, you'd probably smother one small 
piece with chile-garlic dip and chew it up real fast. 
</P>
<P>
Just as crunchy is fried hen, a small chicken chopped up before frying so that 
the maximum possible surface area has the chance to crisp -- more crunchy bits 
than you'd ever thought a chicken could develop. 
</P>
<P>
An extraordinary Chiu Chow-style hot-and-sour soup -- closer to an intense 
Cantonese sweet-and-sour sauce thinned into soup than to either a Thai or 
Sichuan hot-and-sour -- bathes chunked tomato, pineapple and either fish or 
shrimp, bright with cilantro and the hotness of fresh chiles. A seaweed soup, 
its rich, briny taste underlaid with salt and fried garlic, comes with little 
fish quenelles whose relative blandness is a nice contrast to the soup. 
</P>
<P>
And you'll want to try the Chiu Chow hot pot, similar to the Thai sook. Over a 
portable propane burner lugged to the table, a pot of broth, red with tomatoes 
and chiles, is brought to a quick boil. You feed the broth from plates piled 
with vegetables, thick rice noodles, raw beef and seafood (if you've ordered 
the combination); fish out tidbits with little wire strainers; trail slices of 
beef through the broth until they just whiten . . . until 15 minutes into the 
process you tire of the ritual and dump everything into the pot, including a 
raw egg that thickens the mess into something resembling tastier sukiyaki. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Tar is incredibly cheap: a party of four can stuff themselves on the most 
expensive dishes and spend only about $30, and a set menu that includes some of 
the best dishes in the house feeds three for $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Tar, 4806 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 669-1180. Open daily 9:30 a.m. 
to 9:30 p.m. Parking in back. No alcohol. No credit cards accepted. Dinner for 
two, food only, $7-$15.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A SLICE OF MANHATTAN IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The westward migration of New York restaurants to Los Angeles continues. 
Mezzaluna, 9428 Brighton Way, Beverly Hills, (213) 275-6703, stuck a couple of 
palm trees near the front door, but it's basically the same restaurant as the 
popular Manhattan original: a neighborhood pizza joint for the incredibly chic. 
</P>
<P>
Carpaccio comes in several guises -- with artichokes, with avocado, even 
briefly sauteed, for those who like their raw meat cooked. Pastas are the 
simple, rustic sort. And pizzas, which emerge crisp and thin-crusted from the 
sculpted mouth of a fire god -- actually a wood-burning oven -- come topped 
with things like pancetta and onions, or radicchio and smoked mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
No reservations are accepted -- the idea is to drop in and hang out. While you 
wait for a table, count the Mezzaluna logos. The cheerful renderings of Italian 
half-moon-shaped chopping blades (sort of an 18th-Century version of a 
Veg-o-matic with smiley faces) pop up in the most unusual places. LAURIE OCHOA

RYBCZYNSKI'S 'ORCHESTRA' VIDEO ON PBS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget the title, at least in its usual meanings. Zbig Rybczynski's "The 
Orchestra," airing tonight on PBS' "Great Performances" (10 p.m., Channel 28; 9 
p.m., Channels 15 and 24), is not a documentary, unless it be of Rybczynski's 
own visual fantasies and his prowess with multilayered, superimposed video 
images. 
</P>
<P>
For the Greeks, however, the orchestra was the area in front of the stage used 
for the chorus and dancing, and the MTV-meister's six-part video does indeed 
dance. There is a sense of fluid movement to the imagery, generally closely 
connected to the meter of the accompanying classical pops selections. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship of sight and sound is sometimes obvious -- complementary in 
the somber procession of faces recycling through the Funeral March from 
Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2; transformational in the chaste coupling of 
near-nude cruciform bodies spinning in Chartres Cathedral to Schubert's "Ave 
Maria"; savagely ironic in the progressive demise of Soviet communism marching 
to the bourgeois epic, "Bolero." 
</P>
<P>
Other relationships seem more obscure, particularly the downbeat pageant played 
out on white planks suspended in blue clouds to Albinoni's Adagio in G minor. 
The second movement of Mozart's so-called "Elvira Madigan" Piano Concerto 
supports a mocking ode to sterile formality and conspicuous consumption, while 
in the Louvre, women in lingerie cavort earnestly with soldiers to Rossini's 
"La Gazza Ladra" Overture. 
</P>
<P>
The musical selections are not related to each other, but Rybczynski's visuals 
connect each piece, most obviously in the steady cyclic procession of the large 
and evocative cast. His people and their costumes reflect obsessive concerns 
with class, sex and aging. 
</P>
<P>
Parables of life, lust and death abound, in an often slick, trendy package. The 
visual puns and image-play can seem unduly coy as well as inventive, 
obfuscation for its own sake. But there is also a ready elegance and a sense of 
both concern and fun to Rybczynski's virtuosic surrealism.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst was slowly walking out of the stadium Thursday 
afternoon when he heard the noise. His head stayed down, but he has been around 
this game long enough to recognize the sounds of a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst was in no mood to stop for any chit-chat, quickening his pace past the 
Chicago Cubs' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Had he bothered to stop, he would have heard the Cubs jubilantly talking about 
their 3-1 victory over the Padres, ending their six-game losing streak in front 
of 29,168 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
He could have listened to starting pitcher Mike Harkey saying that his only 
regret was the timing of Phil Stephenson's eighth-inning home run, ruining his 
no-hitter and knocking him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
He could have heard Jerome Walton telling reporters about his infield hit that 
ended Hurst's shutout in the eighth or Shawon Dunston talking about his home 
run off Craig Lefferts in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
He could have even stopped to say goodby to former teammates Marvell Wynne and 
Luis Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
But the way he figured it, why heap more punishment on himself? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, maybe the Cubs would tell him how well he pitched, just as his teammates 
and the Padre coaching staff did. Maybe they, too, saw the improvement in his 
delivery this outing. Maybe they would tell him that he deserved better fate 
for his finest performance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But when you're 0-3, off to the worst start of your major league career, no one 
can say anything to make you feel any better. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst didn't even take comfort in the fact that the only hits he allowed 
through the first seven innings Thursday were a flare to left field by Andre 
Dawson and a bloop double to center field by Dunston. It didn't matter to him 
that he struck out seven batters in the first 4 1/3 innings. And although it 
was nice that he was shutting out the Cubs, Harkey was doing the same to his 
team, wasn't he? 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line was that I had to keep doing what I was doing, matching those 
zeroes," Hurst said, "hoping he was the one who breaks. Well, I was the one who 
broke today." 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth time this season, Hurst started a game and left without a 
victory. He has kept the Padres in the game in each of his starts -- even 
throwing a no-hitter for six innings in the season-opener against the Dodgers 
-- but he again left empty-handed Thursday, allowing six hits and two runs in 7 
2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to win the close ones, that's all there is to it," Hurst said. "I 
didn't pitch well in situations again, and it cost me." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, whose up-and-down offense has scored at least seven runs in six 
games this season and two or fewer runs in five games, have been consistent 
only with Hurst on the mound. They have scored all of four total runs, batting 
just .141 with two doubles and a home run. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the best thing I could do to help him is take him to the batting cage," 
said Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson, laughing, hoping that Hurst one day will 
be able to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw the ball great today. It was the best he's thrown it this year. So I 
know he's got to be pleased with what he'd doing." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the way Harkey pitched, Hurst could have been out there all night 
before the Padres figured out how to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had heard of Harkey but never before faced him. This was a guy who 
was born in San Diego and drafted by the Padres in 1984, but he instead chose 
to attend Cal State Fullerton. He spent three years there, was the Cubs' No. 1 
pick in the 1987 draft, made it to the big leagues in September, 1988, and 
spent all of last season in the minors and on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the Padres have discovered, he's back to haunt them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always a Dodger fan, anyway," said Harkey, who moved to Pomona at the 
age of 1. "I had never even been to this stadium until two days ago." 
</P>
<P>
But there he was Thursday afternoon, in front of his wife and 18-month-old son, 
parents, grandparents and about a dozen friends, pitching the game of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He opened by retiring the Padres in the first inning on three weak infield 
grounders, and in the seventh, he again prevented them from hitting the ball 
out of the infield. In between, the Padres still had not managed a hit, the 
closest being a Fred Lynn fly that Walton caught at the center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just awesome, everything was working," Cub catcher Joe Girardi said. 
"But the crazy thing about it was that not a whole lot of people knew he had a 
no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Padres weren't acutely aware of the situation. They had collected a 
couple of walks early, and with Hurst matching Harkey virtually pitch for 
pitch, few realized they might become fodder for history. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even realize it until the seventh inning," Stephenson said. "I was 
just sitting on the bench, and I looked at the scoreboard, and said, 'Damn, we 
don't have a hit yet, you know that?' " 
</P>
<P>
They still were without one when Stephenson came to the plate to lead off the 
eighth. He and Harkey were teammates last season for the Cubs' triple-A team in 
Iowa, but Stephenson was the player-to-be-named in the Aug. 31, 1989 trade that 
also brought Calvin Schiraldi and Darrin Jackson to the Cubs for Wynne and 
Salazar, and they never had a chance to say their farewells. 
</P>
<P>
It had been a nice feeling, Stephenson said, to see Harkey healthy, but now was 
not the time to let sentiment stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to get on," Stephenson said, "I was even talking to Pags 
(teammate Mike Pagliarulo) and saying I might try to bunt my way on." 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson stepped to the plate: Ball 1. Strike 1. Foul. Foul. Ball 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to get on base," Stephenson said, "but in the back of the my 
mind, I thought maybe he'd come back with that inside fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson guessed correctly, slammed it toward the right-field fence and kept 
watching right fielder Andre Dawson drift back and back and back . . . 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson: "I figured either 'Hawk' was going to catch it against the fence, 
or it would scrape the back of the wall going over." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson: "When the ball was hit, it didn't look like it was going out. I thought 
I'd probably catch it on the warning track. I didn't think it was hit that 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Harkey: "I thought maybe it would stay in. Fred Lynn hit a ball just like that, 
and so did Phil the time before, so they didn't go out. But Hawk kept going 
back, going back and just ran out of room." 
</P>
<P>
The ball just cleared the fence for the first homer Harkey ever allowed, 
leaving him slumped on the mound with his hands on his knees. Girardi came out 
to comfort him, but it didn't matter. Stephenson had barely reached home when 
Cub Manager Don Zimmer was at the mound to take the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was either going to be a no-hitter or a one-hitter," said Zimmer, who also 
saw the Cubs' last no-hitter by Milt Pappas in 1972, when he just so happened 
to be managing the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd stood and gave Harkey a loud ovation. He shook a few hands and then 
watched reliever Mitch Williams retire six of the Padres' final seven batters 
-- allowing only a two-out double to Bip Roberts in the eighth -- to record his 
fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I'm happy. I'm not going to second-guess any pitch I threw," said 
Harkey, who came within two outs of a no-hitter against Cal State Long Beach in 
1987. The ironic thing is that in my first spring training, Phil hit a couple 
real good ones against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, of all times, it has to go over."

MCMAHON, CHARGERS PART WAYS; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: TEAM CHOOSES TO GO WITH QUARTERBACKS IT HAS RATHER THAN RISK A LENGTHY, 
DISTRACTING CONTRACT DISPUTE. MCCALLUM IS TRADED BACK TO RAIDERS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending what sometimes seemed to be a hate-hate relationship with San Diego, 
quarterback Jim McMahon was released by the Chargers Thursday after a 
controversial eight-month stay. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bobby Beathard said the Chargers and Steve Zucker, McMahon's 
agent, were unable to come to a contract agreement after a February meeting in 
Chicago and several follow-up discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"After looking at the overall situation," Beathard said, "and after talking to 
them, both sides agreed that the best thing to do was set him free." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's exit preceded the afternoon announcement that the Chargers had sent 
running back Napolean McCallum back to the Raiders for an undisclosed draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum, originally a fourth-round selection of the Raiders in 1986 -- the 
only year he has played in the NFL -- was a two-time All-American at the U.S. 
Naval Academy. He was acquired by the Chargers as part of the 1988 trade that 
sent offensive lineman Jim Lachey to the Raiders, but he struggled in training 
camp last season after being cleared by the Navy to moonlight as a pro football 
player. After three preseason games in which he saw little action, he was 
placed on the "reserve/military" list for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Zucker confirmed from his offices in Chicago that McMahon had been seeking more 
than the $800,000 he received last year, but he would not disclose figures. He 
said the Chargers and McMahon were "on two different wavelengths. We were far 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
Said Beathard: "The night we met in Chicago (in February), he gave me an idea 
of what they were thinking, and I gave him an idea of what we were thinking. He 
wasn't too excited, and I wasn't too excited. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a feeling there wasn't going to be an easy solution to the contract. 
They were thinking something much different then we were." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said the Chargers, fresh off a year-long contract 
disagreement with running back Gary Anderson -- he held out for the 1989 season 
and was dealt to Tampa Bay last week -- were concerned that McMahon's unsettled 
situation might disrupt the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in another drawn-out contract dispute as we had last year 
with Gary Anderson," Henning said. "It's apparent that Jim's contract situation 
could become a distraction." 
</P>
<P>
Said Beathard: "It might have been a distraction with salary negotiations going 
on. This frees us from any distraction." 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides agreed to the breakup, Beathard said it was the Chargers 
who first approached McMahon and Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
"Henning called Jim and Ted (Tollner, quarterback coach), then I called Zucker, 
to tell them what we were thinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, who led Chicago to a Super Bowl championship at the end of 1985 
season, was acquired by the Chargers last August for a second-round draft pick. 
His contract, which made him the highest-paid Charger, expired Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon was 4-7 as a starter before being replaced by rookie Billy Joe Tolliver 
for the final four games. McMahon completed 176 of 318 passes for 2,132 yards, 
with 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner noted that those numbers, while not impressive when compared with those 
of the NFL's top quarterbacks, were statistically close to those he put up in 
happier days with the Bears. In his Super Bowl season, McMahon was 178 for 313 
for 2,392 yards, 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, they're somewhat comparable," Tollner said. "But at that time, he 
had a tremendous defense and a good supporting cast at offense." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said McMahon had another quality. 
</P>
<P>
"He had something that made teams rise to another level," he said. "That's the 
one thing he's been able to do in his career." 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers chose youth and exuberance over McMahon's intangibles, age and 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking more at Billy Joe," Beathard said. "We wanted to give him the 
chance to be the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Tollner said the security that a winning, veteran quarterback brings to an 
organization can be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain amount of excitement with the young guys battling," Tollner 
said. "What you loose in the experience of a veteran you gain in the exuberance 
of youth." 
</P>
<P>
With McMahon gone, the Chargers have three returning quarterbacks: Tolliver, 
seven-year veteran David Archer, who is unsigned, and fourth-year player Mark 
Vlasic. A fourth, the University of Idaho's John Friesz, was acquired with a 
sixth-round pick in the 1990 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said there is no correlation between the Chargers' willingness to 
release McMahon and the acquisition of Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
"That had nothing to do with it," he said. "You don't plan on a rookie coming 
in and taking a veteran's place." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver, the rookie who did just that, said he was surprised by McMahon's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they'd make a move like that after they protected him (under 
Plan B free agency)," Tolliver said. "But it's not my place to second guess the 
administration. My job is to go out and do my best against whoever's out there. 
I'm still in the hunt for a starting position, along with three others." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the Chargers may look for another veteran quarterback but that 
they had decided, before releasing McMahon, that they were ready to start 
training camp with the players they had. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll look for one," he said, "but I don't know if there's one available." 
</P>
<P>
Zucker said he has yet to field any offers from NFL teams for McMahon, who will 
turn 30 in August. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to wait and see who contacts him, but he has a very short list 
of teams he wants to play for." 
</P>
<P>
Zucker would not say who was on it. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner and Beathard said McMahon can still find a place to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll be in the league next season," Beathard said. "He has some 
football left in him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tollner: "If the conditions are right, he has enough ability to start 
somewhere and play winning football." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said image also played a role in the decision. "A lot of things go 
into the equation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After being presented at the time of the Aug. 19 trade as a leader who might 
turn the Chargers into an immediate winner -- he was 35-3 as a starter in his 
last five regular seasons with the Bears -- McMahon quickly developed an uneasy 
relationship with the San Diego media and fans. He once blew his nose in the 
direction of a reporter from a San Diego newspaper, and during the final 
regular season game against Denver in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, he was 
booed each time his name was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Zucker blamed McMahon's image problems on geographics. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think San Diego and Chicago are two different football towns," Zucker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Chargers protected McMahon under Plan B, Beathard said it wasn't a 
ringing endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"It was no big decision to protect him," Beathard said. "It's something we felt 
we had to do at the time. There wasn't someone else out there."

Hawthorne 2, Beverly Hills 1 -- The Cougars, winless in their first eight Bay 
League outings, completed a two-game sweep of first-place Beverly Hills with a 
victory at Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Tarrick Brock's bases-loaded single with no outs in the seventh inning drove in 
Moises Barba with the winning run. Hawthorne, which beat Beverly Hills, 5-4, on 
Tuesday, improved to 10-14 overall and 2-8 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills (15-4, 7-3) had tied the score with one out in the top the 
seventh. Third baseman Barba fielded a grounder but threw the ball into right 
field, allowing Bryan Urda to score from first. 
</P>
<P>
The batter reached third, but was stranded after right-hander Angel Fierro got 
two straight ground-ball outs. Fierro, who gave up five hits, pitched the 
second consecutive complete game for Hawthorne. Ted Golden threw a two-hitter 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills right-hander D.J. Sutton had held Hawthorne to one run going into 
the seventh, but was pulled after hitting Barba with a pitch and walking Robert 
Lujan to open the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Stone followed with a bunt that reliever Steve Belkin fielded and threw 
wide to third, pulling the third baseman off the bag and allowing Barba to 
slide in safely. Brock then hit his game-winner into right field. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne opened a 1-0 lead in the second on a sacrifice fly by Lujan. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes 8, Inglewood 6 -- Jason Goldberg went three for three and drove in 
four runs to help the Sea Kings end a three-game losing streak with a Bay 
League victory at Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to win sometime," said Coach Gil Eberhard, whose team improved to 12-9 
overall and 6-4 in league play. "The law of probability catches up with you." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg's two-run single in the third inning broke a 5-5 tie. Palos Verdes 
opened a 5-0 lead in the second, but Inglewood came back with five runs in the 
third with the help of two Sea King errors. 
</P>
<P>
Junior left-hander Pat O'Hara weathered the bad inning, going the distance to 
even his league record at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes scored five runs in the second on three extra-base hits. Chris 
Heyn had a two-run triple, Goldberg a two-run double and Blake Anderson an RBI 
double. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance 4, Leuzinger 1 -- Mike Kendall, who suffered his first loss Tuesday in 
relief, came back to pitch a five-hitter with nine strikeouts to help the host 
Tartars pull into a first-place tie in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall (8-1), a senior right-hander, gave up no earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Gonzales went two for two with two RBIs, and Anton Williamson and Kris 
Radcliffe each doubled and scored a run, as Torrance improved to 16-5 overall 
and pulled into a three-way tie with Beverly Hills and Rolling Hills in the 
league at 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills 8, Santa Monica 3 -- Steve Archibald's two-run double capped a 
four-run fifth inning and put the Titans ahead to stay, 5-3, in a Bay League 
game at Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Kirt Kishita (5-1 in league play) went six innings, giving up six 
hits. Rolling Hills is 10-9 overall and 7-3 in league, good for a share of 
first place. ROB FERNAS

BANNING COMPLETES 1ST SWEEP OF SAN PEDRO IN YEARS WITH 9-8 VICTORYU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a while since Banning High School swept rival San Pedro in a league 
series -- long enough so that even Banning baseball Coach Syl Saavedra finds 
the edges of his memory a little fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players before the game that it's been 15 years since we've swept 
(San) Pedro," Saavedra said. "But who knows? Maybe it's only been four years." 
</P>
<P>
Saavedra can make a mental note of this year. The Pilots capped a three-game 
sweep of San Pedro with a 9-8 extra-inning victory Thursday afternoon at 
Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"To take a great ball club like San Pedro and sweep them -- it makes my whole 
season a lot sweeter," Saavedra said. "It's good for the players, too. They've 
broken a so-called jinx." 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots battled back from a 7-2 deficit to pull off Thursday's victory, 
which improves the team's record to 14-7 overall and 10-3 in the 
Southern-Pacific Conference. Banning is a game behind first-place Carson in the 
Pacific League. 
</P>
<P>
Banning second baseman Raul Diaz, who singled with one out in the bottom of the 
eighth inning, raced home from third base with the winning run when San Pedro 
shortstop Jose Espinosa bobbled Julian Pardo's sharp grounder. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, the Pilots' leadoff man, went four for four with a double and four runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Star-crossed San Pedro had several opportunities to win but couldn't cash in. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the seventh, Arnie Madrid tripled over the head of Banning 
center fielder LaMont Dobbins, but relief pitcher Mark Chavez (3-2) struck out 
the next batter, Rex Olmeda. Then Pardo made a nice play on Ryan Neal's tough 
grounder to third to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro (10-8-1, 6-6-1) also saw a couple of runs vanish in the fourth when 
catcher Dale Johnson hit an apparent home run down the left-field line with a 
man on base. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's drive soared over both the 320-foot sign on the fence and adjacent 
Avalon Boulevard, but the home-plate umpire ruled it foul. Banning starter 
Anthony Lozano went on to strike out Johnson on a high fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we got jobbed on that call," San Pedro Coach Jerry Lovarov said. 
"Everybody in the park thought it was inside the foul pole." 
</P>
<P>
Saavedra's view from the Banning dugout was the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a home run," he said. "But I'm not going to argue about it." 
</P>
<P>
There was no doubt about the rocket Johnson smoked over the center-field fence 
in the second inning -- a three-run homer that capped a seven-run San Pedro 
rally. Olmeda added a two-run blast, and Banning made four errors behind Lozano 
in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is a funny game," Saavedra said. "We play error-free baseball Tuesday 
at San Pedro, and then we come out here and in one inning we can't catch 
anything for Lozano." 
</P>
<P>
But the Pilots chipped away with a run in the second, two in the fourth and 
three in the fifth. Diaz's opposite-field double to right with two out in the 
fifth gave Banning its first lead of the game, 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
Espinosa's error in the eighth made a hard-luck loser out of San Pedro reliever 
Narciso Mandac (3-2), who struck out Banning's Mike Busby with runners on first 
and third before facing Pardo. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Espinosa had made a brilliant, diving stop over the middle on 
Salvador Areyan's grounder with one out in the eighth, but first baseman Ryan 
Gallagher couldn't hold on to Espinosa's off-balance throw, allowing Diaz to 
move to third. 
</P>
<P>
Carson 4, Gardena 1 -- The Colts stayed a game ahead of second-place Banning in 
the Pacific League with a victory over visiting Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Aaron Fear, normally Carson's starting catcher, was called 
upon to pitch because of an illness to the Colts' regularly scheduled starting 
pitcher. Fear picked up the victory to improve his record to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena left-hander Dane Woolwine took the loss. The Mohicans dropped to 7-9 
overall and 6-6 in the Southern-Pacific Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Carson second baseman Ed Lovato had a pair of RBI singles.

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: QUESTION FOR TOROS: IS IT A DIAMOND OR BOXING RING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Drooz 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first season as baseball coach at Cal State Dominguez Hills, George Wing 
lacked offense. So he went out and recruited a bundle of hitters for this year. 
Now it can't be said that the Toros lack punch. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills has been involved in several bench-clearing fights this season, 
the latest last Friday in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. contest at 
home against Cal State Los Angeles. The Toros were coming from behind to win 
when a Dominguez Hills player bunted toward first and was tagged out -- 
forcibly -- by the Eagles' first baseman. The Toros felt the fielder could have 
beaten the runner to first and went out of his way to apply a rough tag. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. observers don't disagree with that version, but add that they 
had felt provoked. Before the game, they say, the Toros did stretching and 
other warm-up exercises that interfered with the Eagles' infield practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros were also in a brawl at Chapman College in March when the Dominguez 
Hills infield took exception to a hard slide into second base by a Chapman 
runner. The Toros were already irritated by what they perceived to be taunting 
by a Chapman player who had hit a home run to take the lead the inning before. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, it's a change in personality for the Toros, and not 
entirely welcome at the Carson school. The fight with Cal State L.A. was 
costly: Speedy outfielder George Scott, apparently trying to be a peacemaker, 
tripped over someone in the pileup and tore knee ligaments. Scott and his .354 
average are lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wing: "It's not anything we went out looking for. Both times it was in the 
heat of competition, and the two incidents were brought on by the opposing 
teams. Our guys responded. I don't agree with how they responded, but both were 
situations where it was instantaneous and we were not the aggressors." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the opposing coaches in the fights with Dominguez Hills say they don't 
blame Wing and still consider him one of the good guys in the CCAA. In general, 
college baseball teams, which see TV replays of fights between pro baseball 
teams these days, just seem to be emulating the major leaguers more often. 
</P>
<P>
Toro Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, who played baseball at UCLA, has asked the 
team to cool it. "Obviously we don't condone any of those situations," Guerrero 
said. "When I spoke (to Wing), it was to convey the message we want to be 
aggressive, but not to that point." 
</P>
<P>
Wing agreed: "Hopefully, we're gonna lay low on that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Guerrero couldn't resist a dig: "Just call us the battling Toros." 
</P>
<P>
And take no prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Wing's biggest problem this season has been pitching. The Toros dropped to 
seventh in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. last season due largely to 
lack of offense, so Wing recruited a number of outstanding community college 
hitters who have made an immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Toro pitchers have rarely been able to hold down opposing lineups. 
In the team's recent 10-game losing streak, Wing said, six of the games were 
lost by one run although the Toros averaged more than eight runs a game in that 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Wing places much of the blame on himself and his assistants. "We didn't do a 
real good job with the pitching staff from a coaching standpoint," he said 
Thursday. "It hasn't been a real strong learning experience for (the pitchers) 
this year. I thought we brought in some quality guys (recruits). I'm more in 
the market for a pitching coach for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wing and the Toros haven't given up on this season. They are 16-20 
(with two ties) going into the weekend and are still intent on finishing at 
.500 or better. And with seven CCAA games left, the Toros are in a dogfight for 
the upper division. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a chance," Wing said. The Toros just need to rearm themselves. "We 
have to shore that whole (pitching) thing up," he said.

Loyola Marymount's latest tribute to Hank Gathers was unveiled Thursday in the 
gym -- a banner attached to the main scoreboard in Gersten Pavilion that reads 
"HANK'S HOUSE" with a large 44, Gathers' uniform number. 
</P>
<P>
However, this tribute is slightly different from previous ones, which have 
included testimonials from the Los Angeles City Council and the California 
Legislature. This one was conceived and funded by the other athletic teams at 
Loyola for the late basketball star. The project was spearheaded by water polo 
player Tim Bass. 
</P>
<P>
The banner, which also includes the uniform numbers of the other members of the 
basketball team, was officially shown in a noontime ceremony Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive Punch: Dominguez Hills freshman infielder Melissa Punch, on the 
strength of a strong second half, has taken the softball team lead in both 
batting average and runs batted in and is within reach of several school 
records going into Saturday's season-ending double-header at Toro Field. 
</P>
<P>
Punch, a multisport star at Culver City High School, goes into the noon twin 
bill against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo batting .394, owning a school-record 
17-game hitting streak and leading the Lady Toros with 25 runs batted in. She 
is on line to break the school hitting mark of .370 set by Judy Staab in 1982, 
and needs three RBIs to top the school mark set by teammate Maria Romero last 
year. Punch is also tied for the school record of eight doubles, co-owned by 
Romero (1989) and Barb Steffen (1986). 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: Left-hander Armando Gomez became the first Cal State 
Dominguez Hills pitcher to throw a shutout this season when he blanked Cal 
State Los Angeles, 3-0, last week. The Toros have a team earned-run average of 
6.07 but Gomez stands at 3.15. The Toros, who have a .299 team batting average, 
have yet to be shut out this year. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dominguez Hills baseball team takes a break from conference play to travel 
to The Master's College for a 2:30 p.m. game today. The Toros are 16-20-2 
overall and 8-15 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. . . . Dominguez 
Hills third baseman Fred Camarena continues to hit better than .400 and 
challenge the school record. Camarena entered the week batting .403. Ruben 
Jauregui, now a Toro coach, set the school mark of .406 in 1987. . . . The 
Loyola combined crew teams placed seventh in the State Schools Crew 
Championships at Sacramento, led by the men's varsity eight, which placed a 
close third. The top teams were UC Davis with 110 points and UC Santa Barbara 
with 73. Loyola totaled 19 points. . . . Loyola's men's and women's tennis 
teams each placed third in the West Coast Conference championships over the 
weekend. The University of San Diego won the men's title, while Pepperdine won 
the women's.

A DOUBLE THREAT AT DOMINGUEZ HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE SOFTBALL: JENNIFER BOEN PLAYS BOTH GAMES OF LADY TORO DOUBLE-HEADERS -- 
FIRST AS ACE PITCHER AND THEN AS DANGEROUS DESIGNATED HITTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You wouldn't be far off base if you described sophomore Jennifer Boen as the 
leader of the Cal State Dominguez Hills softball team. 
</P>
<P>
In her second year as a Lady Toro, Boen leads the team in hits with 64. She is 
also its top pitcher, with an overall record of 18-7 and a 1.05 earned-run 
average in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Coach Janis Reutz, Boen is also the team's spiritual leader. 
"She gives us a lift when we need her to. You don't find the player who will do 
anything that you ask of her too often, but she is just that kind of player." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Reutz said, Boen often plays both ends of a double-header, a 
rarity for a starting pitcher. Yet most college softball games are scheduled as 
double-headers. In the second game of the day, Boen is usually the designated 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
It's not an easy transition to make, Boen said. Between games, she has to 
change her outlook completely. 
</P>
<P>
"I get psyched up to pitch, and then I have to get myself calmed down enough to 
be a good hitter," she said. "That's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Boen was a utility infielder and an occasional starting pitcher. As 
a utility player, she garnered all-CCAA honors; as a pitcher, she posted a 4-1 
record with an 0.40 ERA in eight appearances. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change this season has been the Lady Toros' improved hitting, Boen 
said. They are batting .262 compared to only .207 last year. And because her 
teammates are hitting well, Boen herself gets better pitches to hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros are 29-24-1 overall, but their CCAA record, with one conference 
game left, is a disappointing 4-14. They are out of contention for post-season 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Boen isn't discouraged, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we get to play spoiler, the wins will be good ones," she said. 
"People took us lightly at the beginning of the season, and this is the time of 
the year that we can make them regret that. The season is never over for a team 
if they can play spoiler." 
</P>
<P>
Boen said she has not had any injuries, but Ruetz said soreness in her arm -- 
the result of pitching so many innings this year -- has recently kept her from 
playing in the field. 
</P>
<P>
When the other starting pitcher, Kim Park, left the team for several games 
because of frustration with the play of the infield, Boen had to pitch both 
games of the double-headers. 
</P>
<P>
"It really took a lot out of me physically when Kim left the team," Boen said. 
"By the time the second game rolled around, the opposing teams were really 
starting to hit my pitching. I don't know if it was because I was tired or they 
had just seen enough of my pitching to know what pitch to look for." 
</P>
<P>
With Park's return, Boen said, things are back to normal and playing is much 
more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
To be successful, she said, the team needed Park. She said there was no 
malicious intent when fielders made numerous errors behind Park early in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Boen started the year playing first base, but only until basketball player 
Melissa Punch could join the softball team. Punch leads the Lady Toros with a 
.394 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
That was the last time Boen played the infield, though she has occasionally 
played the outfield when needed. 
</P>
<P>
Boen, who comes from Bakersfield, said she moved south to see what else 
California had to offer. There is more to do in the Los Angeles area, she said, 
but now that the newness has worn off, she finds it unpleasantly crowded. 
</P>
<P>
What she misses most is her parents, Boen said. Last year was the toughest, she 
said, because it was her first time away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Boen is a business major with an emphasis on accounting. After her playing days 
are over, she expects to get a job as an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"Business classes are the one thing that I like about school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those classes are demanding, she said, and in order to get in enough study 
time, she sleeps only six hours a night. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much of a future for softball players after college, but Boen said 
she looks forward to playing the game as long as her body holds out. 
</P>
<P>
At Dominguez Hills, she said, she works hardest on team play, on the 
togetherness that Coach Ruetz says the Lady Toros need to have in order to win. 
</P>
<P>
With two years to go, Boen is already at the top of her game. Her only 
question, she said, is whether she can continue to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can continue to compete with the same strength for the next two years 
that I do now," she said. "I want to get the job done."

COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY TAKES OVER FOURTH PLACE WITH 9-1 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valley College erupted for six runs in the seventh inning to overcome a 1-0 
deficit and post a 9-1 victory over host Glendale in a Western State Conference 
baseball game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs (16-19-2, 10-9 in conference play) moved into sole possession of 
fourth place, one game ahead of Ventura, Santa Barbara and Bakersfield, all 
9-10. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which was tied with Valley entering Thursday's action, fell to Cuesta, 
9-3. Valley will conclude its conference season by playing host to Canyons on 
Saturday. The Cougars are tied with Moorpark and Cuesta for the conference lead 
at 14-5, four games ahead of Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Against Glendale, Valley trailed, 1-0, entering the seventh inning, but 
Vladimir Pajcin doubled home Mark Cavarretta, who had singled, to tie the 
score. Jon Stevens singled in E. J. Pape with what proved to be the 
game-winning run. Valley had only five hits but took advantage of two errors 
and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Cizek (1-2), a freshman right-hander from Kennedy High, scattered six 
hits and struck out six. Kevin Thomas and Pajcin were each three for four. 
Thomas drove in two runs and Chad Ratliff added two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is 6-14 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara 15, Pierce 6 -- Pat Huston was two for three, including his sixth 
home run, and Carl McFadden had two hits and drove in three runs to lead host 
Pierce (16-20, 7-12) in a Western State Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended Pierce's three-game winning streak and eliminated the Brahmas 
from contention for a berth in the conference playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Cuesta 9, Ventura 3 -- David Eggert had two hits, including a home run, and 
John Sunia added a pair of hits to lead visiting Ventura in a Western State 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Cuesta improved to 22-13-2 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Mission 7, Compton 6 -- Mike Rogers had two hits and drove in the winning run 
in the eighth inning for Mission (24-11-1, 14-6) in a Southern California 
Athletic Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Chavez and John Kukawski each had two hits for Mission. Kukawski singled 
to lead off the eighth, moved to third on consecutive sacrifice bunts, and 
scored on Rogers' single. 
</P>
<P>
Compton fell to 6-14 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino Valley 5, Antelope Valley 2 -- Mike Mueller doubled and hit a 
two-run home run to lead Antelope Valley (9-25, 4-13) in a Foothill Conference 
game.

WELL-TRAVELED KRAMER SHOWS HEART OF A LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite being cut twice and suffering a serious knee injury, Erik Kramer never 
lost faith in his ability to play quarterback in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
It paid off for the former Burroughs High and Pierce College standout last 
month when he signed a two-year contract with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great to throw an NFL ball again instead of that big balloon they 
have in Canada," said Kramer, who participated in the Lions' recent mini-camp 
in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The mini-camp was Kramer's first football action since partially tearing 
ligaments in his left knee during a scrimmage with the Canadian Football 
League's Calgary Stampeders last summer. He was the team's starting quarterback 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it needed to happen," Kramer said. "I knew going in, it was 
risky to have a live scrimmage. But that's the breaks. You just have to play 
the cards you're dealt." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer said the injury occurred when a defensive lineman rolled into him after 
he released a pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just one starting offensive lineman returning," Kramer said. "The 
starting left tackle was a tight end in college and had never played offensive 
line before. He had already gotten beat a few times." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer underwent arthroscopic surgery, which kept him out the entire season. 
When his CFL contract expired, he sent videotapes of his play to several NFL 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I got some feedback from Detroit, Washington and Tampa Bay," Kramer said. "I 
worked out for Detroit and made the decision from there. I feel like I have a 
pretty good shot there." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer, 25, is among six quarterbacks competing for what is expected to be 
three roster positions. 
</P>
<P>
The others are Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware of Houston; former USC star 
Rodney Peete, the starter most of last season; former Hoover High and Glendale 
College standout Bob Gagliano, who sparked the Lions' season-ending five-game 
winning streak; Eric Jones, who spent last season on the developmental squad; 
and former starter Chuck Long, who is asking to be traded. 
</P>

"The coaches say all the quarterbacks will share equal time in practice, and 
that's where I'll have to build my base," said Kramer, an honorable-mention 
All-American at Pierce in 1984 when he led the Brahmas to a 10-1 season. "That 
will give me the chance to develop a good foundation going into the preseason 
games. Once I get into the preseason, I know I can put on a pretty good show." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer's pro football odyssey began in 1987 after signing with the New Orleans 
Saints as a free agent out of North Carolina State. After his release at the 
end of training camp, Kramer became a hot commodity two weeks later when NFL 
teams were seeking replacement players during the players' strike. Kramer opted 
for the Atlanta Falcons, for whom he started two games and passed for 335 yards 
and three touchdowns in an upset of a veteran Rams team. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons kept Kramer after the strike, but he did not play another 
regular-season game. Kramer was relased the week of Atlanta's 1988 
regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
He signed with the Stampeders in October and started five games, completing 62 
of 153 passes for 964 yards and five touchdowns.

L.A. BROADCASTER WILL BUY KJQY-FM FOR $20 MILLION

<P>
Legacy Broadcasting of Los Angeles has agreed to purchase KJQY, an 
easy-listening format FM station in San Diego, for $20 million, sources said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Legacy Chairman Carl E. Hirsch confirmed that a sale is due to close in May but 
declined to discuss the price. 
</P>
<P>
The seller is Command Communications based in Dallas, which acquired the 
station in January. A previously announced deal to sell the station to Westwood 
One, a broadcasting-publishing concern in Los Angeles, fell through. 
</P>
<P>
KJQY, or "KJOY" as it is known, currently has an easy adult listening format. 
It scored a 5.3% market share in the most recent Arbitron audience survey 
ratings, ninth best among San Diego FM stations. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch said that format changes are in the offing for the station to make it 
appeal to younger audiences but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Hirsch's Legacy chain sold all 10 of its stations, including 
KTWV-FM of Los Angeles, to Group W as part of a complex $727-million merger, 
one of the largest deals ever in radio broadcasting. Legacy remains a 15% 
shareholder in Group W. The rest is owned by Westinghouse Electric. 
</P>
<P>
Legacy is also in escrow to buy two other stations, WMJI-FM in Cleveland and 
WYHY-FM in Nashville from Jacor Communications for $31.25 million. All three 
station purchases will close simultaneously, Hirsch said Thursday.

LIFE, ART BLEND IN 'CINEMA PARADISO'; 
</P>
<P>
OSCAR WINNER: NOSTALGIC ITALIAN FILM TELLS OF A YOUNGSTER'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH 
THE MOVIES AND HOW IT SHAPED HIS ADULT LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cinema, Jean Cocteau once said, is the only art form that shows death at 
work -- and death, time and our love for films are the subjects of Giuseppe 
Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso" (at the Cove Theater in La Jolla). 
</P>
<P>
It's a shining valentine to the movies -- full of homages, collages and 
swooningly romantic Ennio Morricone music -- and it gets right at the messy, 
impure, wondrous way they capture and enrapture us. It's a film about why 
people love movies, how they can both break our hearts and lift them up again. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the Oscar for best foreign-language film, "Cinema Paradiso" is set 
mostly in a small Sicilian fishing village in the '40s and '50s, recalled by a 
man journeying back for the funeral of an old friend. It's an almost 
unabashedly sentimental film. But, in a way, that fits. Movies, in general, are 
a crowd-pleasing, impure art, and the movies we see here -- though sometimes 
great classics -- are messily and happily involved with the day-to-day lives of 
the people who watch them. 
</P>
<P>
For all its dramatic flaws, "Cinema" becomes a cascade of wonders on the 
screen, enlivened by its great central image: the wonderful old Paradiso 
theater, a cross between a village church and a sleazy bijou, set in a Sicilian 
village square. The film follows two lives dominated by the Paradiso: the 
child, Salvatore Di Vitta, whose obsession leads to adult vocation as a film 
director, and his mentor and paterfamilias, Alfredo, the Paradiso's Rabelaisian 
projectionist (Philippe Noiret). 
</P>
<P>
Young Salvatore, nicknamed Toto, is played with brio and ebullience by an 
8-year-old Sicilian, Salvatore Cascio: a flashing-eyed imp with an entrancing 
smile and a sneaky streak. The teen-age Salvatore (Marco Leonardi) is a 
petulant juvenile who spends much of his time mooning over a young girl of 
"superior" social class, whose image he first catches in a movie camera. The 
elder Salvatore (played by Jacques Perrin, once the charming juvenile of "The 
Sleeping Car Murders" and "Z") is a gray-haired urban sophisticate, a 
bed-hopping bachelor who has, apparently, avoided his town and mother for 30 
years, though Rome is only an hour away by plane. 
</P>
<P>
While the movies open up the world for Salvatore, they close it down for 
Alfredo. They seal him up in a hot, tiny, dangerous cubicle where he is 
condemned to watch the same images over and over, talking with phantoms; where 
he must -- under the prudish dictates of the local priest -- snip out every 
kissing scene from every film. 
</P>
<P>
In an accident, the movies actually turn on him, blinding him when the nitrate 
ignites and burns down the theater, ironically at a moment when Toto's 
namesake, the great Italian clown, is cavorting on film. When Alfredo loses the 
movies, he has only Toto -- who becomes his successor, the new projectionist -- 
and his memories. And the movies, and the lure of the city, take Toto from him 
too. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the older Salvatore is a man shaped by the new cinema, a product of 
the old movie palaces who's adapted himself to the era of the VCR and the 
multiplex. But Alfredo -- as Noiret memorably and beautifully plays him -- is 
the soul of the old cinema. He's intimately involved with the "Golden Age," the 
black-and-white movies of the '20s-'40s, and, playing him, Noiret summons up 
the image of the great beefy French character actors of the period, the Raimus 
and Michel Simons. When he dies, the Cinema Paradiso does too, torn down on the 
same weekend as Alfredo's funeral. Videos and TV, both of which Salvatore 
probably directs, have killed it. 
</P>
<P>
Tornatore began as an award-winning photographer and he's stronger on imagery 
than psychology, on the film past than the real-life present. The spirit of 
Fellini hovers over the movie house and the city square, Antonioni over the 
chilly, bare Rome apartments and Visconti over the seascapes. This 33-year-old 
film maker may actually have given too much of himself to the 53-year-old 
Salvatore, who acts more like an alienated young bachelor. Perhaps the movie's 
main flaw is the way Tornatore lets Salvatore off the hook; it is Alfredo who 
demands that his protege leave town and never look back, as if absolving Toto 
for his selfishness. 
</P>
<P>
There's a tricky balance here. But Noiret -- a consummate craftsman even, as 
here, when he's being dubbed into Italian -- keeps Alfredo real and earthy, a 
lugubrious-looking bear who turns preternatural wizard in the booth. Salvatore 
may become a cinema aristocrat, but this illiterate old peasant has a tactile 
love affair with the movies, the takeup reels, the gigantic single projector 
that pours its blaze of light through an aperture formed into the shape of a 
roaring lion. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath Alfredo is an entire community that Tornatore lovingly re-creates. 
While Alfredo shows movies like Renoir's social-realist classic "The Lower 
Depths" or Visconti's Sicilian epic "Le Terra Trema," the audience divides up 
into classes too. Up in the balcony is a bespectacled snob who spits on the 
rabble below. Underneath is a hurly-burly of working men and women, 
prostitutes, local families and small children like Toto. 
</P>
<P>
Tornatore catches this rowdy crowd in a spirit of satire, but he also fills the 
movie with odd, reverent imagery. Sex and religion, mysticism and sensuality, 
are the twin poles of "Paradiso." For every film homage, for every clip of 
Errol Flynn smooching or Vittorio De Sica gambling or Brigitte Bardot 
lusciously in the nude, there's often a religious symbol: the local priest who 
rings his bell at obscenities; the plaster Madonna flaming up along with the 
burning stills of Bogart or Buster Keaton. Toto is altar boy as well as 
Alfredo's assistant; he crosses himself when he enters the projection booth. 
When the new Cinema Paradiso opens, priests bless it and then recoil from the 
"pornographic" sight of a torrid Silvana Mangano mambo. And when now-blind 
Alfredo makes his first visit there he asks, almost plaintively, "Any room for 
me in the new paradise?" 
</P>
<P>
Is there any room? "Cinema Paradiso" (Times-rated Family despite language and 
lovemaking) is not just about the relationship or tragedy of Toto and Alfredo. 
It's about the loss of a whole culture, a whole era -- a time when audiences 
gathered in intimate communion in their favorite movie houses, when movies and 
distribution weren't calculated, homogenized and marketing-hooked to death, and 
when the people who showed and watched them loved them madly. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem absurd or oversentimental to keep linking up films with objects of 
worship and love affairs as Tornatore does here, but it reflects how people 
really felt, how many of us feel now. 
</P>
<P>
And when Salvatore the movie aristocrat watches, in a modern screening room, 
the last gift bequeathed to him by his old friend, the peasant-worker of 
"Cinema Paradiso," it's a moment of epiphany that goes beyond sentimentality. 
It's a flood of passion, a collage of tenderness. It suggests the moment when 
cinema, released in the dark, almost becomes paradise.

<P>
So many concerts, so little time. That's the problem facing San Diego pop fans 
as they prepare for the busiest concert weekend so far this year. Some 
recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
* Garth Brooks, performing Friday night at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa, is the 
latest country neo-traditionalist to emerge on a major label. The 27-year-old 
Oklahoman's debut album came out last year on Capitol Records and promptly won 
him comparisons to Dwight Yoakam and Ricky Van Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was born into a musical family. His mother is the former Colleen 
Carroll, who in the mid-1950s recorded country for Capitol Records and was a 
regular on Red Foley's Ozark Jubilee. His older sister worked with Gus Hardin. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks' father turned him on to George Jones and Merle Haggard when he was 
young, but he didn't begin actively singing and playing guitar until he was in 
college. Attending Oklahoma State University on a track scholarship, he also 
performed six nights a week in clubs near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, Brooks felt he was ready for the big time, and he moved to Nashville. 
According to his record company-issued biography, he left the Music City after 
just 23 hours, "disillusioned but not beaten." Back home in Oklahoma, Brooks 
returned to college and spent two years on the road with Santa Fe, a popular 
regional touring band. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Brooks returned to Nashville, this time without the delusions of 
grandeur he had had on his first visit. He started singing on songwriter demos 
and was signed by Capitol Records who had heard him perform at a Nashville 
Entertainment Assn. showcase; his debut album was an immediate favorite with 
critics and radio stations around the country, and he's a nominee in the "Best 
New Artist" category in this year's annual Country Music Assn. awards 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
* Also on Friday, memories of the Apollo Theater in Harlem will be rekindled at 
the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, with performances by Curtis Mayfield and 
Sharkskin. 
</P>
<P>
Mayfield is a founding member of the Impressions, the Chicago-based soul group 
that scored more than a dozen Top 40 hits between 1958 and 1974, including "For 
Your Precious Love," "It's All Right," "Keep On Pushing," and "Amen." Mayfield 
went solo in 1970 and subsequently cracked the Top 40 five more times on his 
own -- in 1972, "Freddie's Dead" and "Superfly" both went gold. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he's produced, and written for, various other soul acts, including 
Gladys Knight and the Pips and the Staple Singers. He's also dabbled in movies, 
scoring such films as "Claudine," "Let's Do It Again," and "Short Eyes," a 
low-budget prison drama in which he also acted. 
</P>
<P>
The show-opening Sharkskins are a San Diego group founded a little more than a 
year ago by brothers Alfred and Robert Williams. The seven-member soul revue's 
repertoire consists primarily of vintage rhythm-and-blues hits like James 
Brown's "Please Please Please" and "I Got You (I Feel Good)," Wilson Pickett's 
"In the Midnight Hour," and Bobby Blue Bland's "Don't Cry No More." 
</P>
<P>
* On Saturday, the Temptations and the Four Tops will be appearing at the 
Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park. Both groups helped define the fabled "Motown 
sound" of the middle 1960s, when they shook, rattled, and rolled out of Detroit 
and into the national spotlight with a bevy of soul hits characterized by 
catchy melodies, sensual rhythms, and passionate vocals. 
</P>
<P>
The Temptations are probably the most successful male vocal group of the 1960s 
and early '70s, with nearly 3 dozen Top 40 hits to their credit -- including 
"My Girl," "Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)," and "Papa Was a 
Rollin' Stone." The original group came together in 1962 and was promptly 
signed by Gordy Records, a Motown subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Smokey Robinson's "The 
Way You Do the Things You Do," and they maintained a constant chart presence 
for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there had been several personnel changes and a shift in 
direction from romantic pop ballads to the "psychedelic" soul sound popularized 
by Sly and the Family Stone. 
</P>
<P>
The Temptations last cracked the Top 40 in 1975, with "Glasshouse." Two years 
later, the group left Gordy for Atlantic Records and recorded a pair of disco 
albums. In 1980, Motown wooed them back; since then, the Temptations have 
continued to make records, but their biggest success has been on the road, 
plying the oldies circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said of the Four Tops, who with one exception -- 1981's "When 
She Was My Girl" -- have been hitless for 17 years. Between 1964 and 1973, the 
vocal quartet charted more than 20 times with upbeat love songs featuring Levi 
Stubbs' rough-hewn lead vocals. Among them: "I Can't Help Myself," "It's the 
Same Old Song," "Reach Out (I'll Be There)," "Bernadette," and "Ain't No Woman 
(Like the One I've Got)," all of which made it into the Top 5. 
</P>
<P>
The four members met at a party in the early 1950s and soon began singing 
together as the Four Aims. In 1956, they were signed by Chess Records and 
changed their name to the Four Tops. It wasn't until eight years, and almost as 
many labels, later, however, that they scored their first hit, "Baby I Need 
Your Loving," which came out on Motown and peaked at No. 11. In 1972, the Four 
Tops left Motown for ABC/Dunhill, which released their last four hits; they 
spent the rest of the 1970s playing oldies in supper clubs and Las Vegas 
lounges. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the Four Tops were signed by Casablanca Records and suddenly found 
themselves back on the charts with "When She Was My Girl." Buoyed by this 
success, the group decided to step up its touring schedule and look for 
bookings in bigger venues. And today, like the Temptations, the Four Tops are 
once again recording for Motown and playing to packed houses all over the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
* Also on Saturday, Karla Bonoff will be at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa. Andy 
Warhol once said that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes, and this talented 
singer-songwriter's moment came in 1976, when she was signed by Columbia 
Records after placing three songs on Linda Ronstadt's best-selling "Hasten Down 
the Wind" album. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia touted Bonoff as the Next Big Thing, but she wasn't: Her debut album 
sold moderately well, but critics mercilessly compared her to Ronstadt and she 
took two years to assemble a second album. By then, the momentum created by the 
much-hyped signing was lost, and after cutting a third album for Columbia -- 
1981's "Wild Heart of the Young," which featured guest appearances by J.D. 
Souther, Little Feat's Bill Payne, and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, Don Henley and 
Tim Schmidt -- she was unceremoniously dropped by the label. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Bonoff -- whose musical career began in the late 1960s, playing 
Monday-night hoots at the Troubadour near her family's West Los Angeles home -- 
has kept a low profile, writing songs and sharing scattered club dates with 
fellow singer-songwriters like Souther, Bonnie Raitt and John Prine. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '80s, she signed with Gold Castle Records and returned to the road 
as a headliner in support of her comeback album, "New World," which came out in 
January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* And on Sunday, the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach will host Ginger Baker, 
perhaps the most celebrated rock 'n' roll drummer of all time. Baker's 
star-studded resume includes stints with seminal British supergroups Cream and 
Blind Faith; according to the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock 'n' Roll, "His 
splashy style paved the way for a decade of heavy-metal drum solos." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, Baker played with traditional jazz bands in and around his 
hometown of Lewisham, England. He later played with two of England's most 
influential rhythm-and-blues bands, Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated (which 
he joined in 1962 when Charlie Watts left to form the Rolling Stones) and the 
Graham Bond Organization. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Baker teamed up with ex-Manfred Mann bassist Jack Bruce and guitarist 
Eric Clapton, formerly with the Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, to 
form Cream. Three years later, Baker and Clapton split to form Blind Faith, a 
short-lived supergroup whose other members were singer Steve Winwood, formerly 
with the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic, and ex-Family bassist Rick Grech. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Baker put together his own group, Ginger Baker's Air Force, which he 
used to explore his growing interest in African music. The following year, he 
moved to Lagos, Nigeria, where he produced and recorded African musicians at 
his private recording studio. In 1974, Baker reemerged with the Baker-Gurvitz 
Army, which cut three jazz-rock albums before disbanding in the late 1970s; 
since then, he's recorded four albums with space-rock band Hawkwind as well as 
several solo albums, the most recent of which is 1986's "Horses and Trees."

CALIFORNIA CUCINA REVIVES THE ORDINARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how fresh the food products, it still takes care and skill, if not 
talent, to make them into appealing dishes. 
</P>
<P>
So, when a restaurant such as California Cucina, located in a new shopping 
strip in Toluca Lake, offers freshness and vitality of flavor, I pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's not consistently excellent, California Cucina's successes are 
notable. For one thing, it made me reconsider dishes that are so consistently 
poorly made that I had stopped taking them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest offenders in this category is ratatouille -- I've come to 
call it the gray vegetable. Many other restaurants serve it as an almost always 
cold, overcooked vegetable stew whose original flavors have been leached out 
and replaced with mysterious seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
But the hot ratatouille at California Cucina serves as a base for grilled 
Italian sausage. You get whole, flavorsome tomato concasse with smaller 
quantities of full-textured diced eggplant and sliced zucchini shot through 
with sprigs of fresh rosemary. It is as alive, vital and colorful as if it were 
being served in Provence. 
</P>
<P>
Angel hair pasta with a similar sauce (basil is the predominant herb here) is 
equally impressive, although the scallops served when I ate there were somewhat 
overdone. 
</P>
<P>
Another surprise, or even shock -- the fried mozzarella. Testing the 
restaurant's culinary limits, I ordered the dish, which is probably the most 
butchered of all Italian-inspired dishes. But here, the cheese was thinly 
sliced so that it was warmed through and through, the fried coating was 
delicate, and the vibrant tomato concasse and basil were underneath, where they 
belong. Now this dish has re-entered my active mental menu. 
</P>
<P>
I also enjoyed the cream-sauce dishes. Linguine with a walnut-Gorgonzola cream 
sauce was very rich, but the flavors were well-balanced. So was a rib-eye steak 
in a green peppercorn sauce. Salads also were appealing, though there wasn't 
much "Caesar" to the Caesar. 
</P>
<P>
California Cucina serves a number of dishes that are far superior to what you'd 
expect to get in a shopping strip or most anywhere, for that matter. Not only 
is the cooking a surprise, so are the portions and the prices: the former 
generous, the latter reasonable. However, the service, though speedy, could use 
some polish. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: fried mozzarella with tomato basil sauce, $5.25; angel hair 
pasta with tomato, garlic and basil, $6; linguine with walnut-Gorgonzola cream 
sauce, $6.50; Italian sausage with ratatouille, $6.50.

PREVIEW: ARTIST EXHIBITS INITIATIVE WITH CRAFTS FAIR

<P>
After several years of exhibiting her soft sculptures -- ducks, birds and other 
small animals -- at local outdoor festivals, Ronda Mills became discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of advertising, unreasonable admission prices and shows coinciding with 
children's carnivals contributed to what she called unprofessional exhibits 
plagued by low public turnout. The artists, she said, were cheated. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1983, the West Hills resident established West Coast Artists, a venue for 
local and national artists to display their products throughout Southern 
California. Tomorrow and Sunday, her organization will present the ninth 
semiannual Valencia Fine Arts and Crafts Festival at Old Orchard Park, 25051 N. 
Avenida Rotella in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last seven years, the art festivals have grown -- today Mills' mailing 
list consists of more than 3,000 artists, and exhibits are held at 16 locations 
annually. Most shows, Mills said, feature about 100 booths, including ceramics, 
clothing, country crafts, jewelry, soft and iron sculpture, woodwork, stained 
glass and fine arts items. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronda puts on a great festival," said Chet Blacketer, a sculptor who works in 
iron and exhibits with West Coast Artists about 10 times a year. "She's an 
honest businesswoman who, because of her own creative flair, understands the 
artist. And she puts profits back into advertising so the public actually shows 
up. That's important. If you're an artist, you've got to have the public see 
your work." 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old Yucaipa artist and his wife, Carrol, are known for their 
sculptures of locomotives, Model-T automobiles and figures. Blacketer, a pipe 
fitter by trade, said he and his wife spend from a few days to six months 
welding fragments at 3,500 degrees with an electric arc to complete the iron 
configurations. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor festivals, such as the ones West Coast Artists promotes, have not only 
yielded a substantial public following for the Blacketers but have also caught 
the business community's attention. Unocal's Westlake Village office 
commissioned the couple to make a five-foot replica of an oil rig and the Hand 
Prop Room of Los Angeles has contracted their ironwork as background art for 
office and home settings in several television series. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 arts and crafts booths will be featured at West Coast Artists' 
ninth semiannual Valencia Fine Arts and Crafts Festival from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Saturday and Sunday at Old Orchard Park, 25051 N. Avenida Rotella, Valencia. 
Admission is free. For additional information, call (818) 884-8284. HEATHER W.

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: SOMETIMES POWERFUL SHOW UNCOVERS NATIVE 
AMERICAN ROOTS

"We are part of the Earth, and it is part of us," Chief Seattle replied to a 
U.S. government request to buy Native American land in 1854. "The perfumed 
flowers are our sisters; the deer, the horse, the great eagle, these are our 
brothers. . . . Whatever happens to the beasts, soon happens to man. All things 
are connected." 
</P>
<P>
Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, artist, member of the Flathead tribe in Montana and 
guest curator of the current exhibition at the Centro Cultural de la Raza, 
quotes Chief Seattle in both the title of the show and her introductory wall 
statement. His words serve as a screen of ideas, a philosophical filter through 
which to experience the work on view. 
</P>
<P>
"Indian people," she writes, "have lived by this philosophy for eons of time. 
The Native artists have made and still make their work in reverence and praise 
of this philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
"We Are Part of the Earth: Contemporary Native American Works on Paper," at the 
Centro (in Balboa Park's Pepper Grove) through May 20, joins 11 artists on the 
basis of their ethnic identity. Like most shows organized along racial or 
cultural lines, this one is both problematic and enlightening. Its curatorial 
premise constricts the audience's focus to questions of identity, ancestry and 
cultural history. The extent to which these issues are manifested in the work 
often becomes an unspoken gauge of its relevance. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, attention paid to artists belonging to traditions other than 
white and Eurocentric is always refreshing, at least in intent, and often the 
concentration of such work is intellectually and spiritually broadening. Chief 
Seattle's words alone give ample food for thought here with their poetic 
evocation of the unity of all living things. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of works in the show resonate powerfully with this notion, especially 
Emmi Whitehorse's large drawings in oil. A rich and beautiful chaos reigns in 
the fluid, interconnected world that Whitehorse visualizes. Smooth, shadowy 
blues or warm reds dominate each page, creating a translucent veil of color 
from which figures and forms emerge and recede, taunting both gravity and 
expectation. In one work, a straight band, split at top and bottom, doubles as 
a tree and exhilarated human -- in either case, an emblem of growth and 
vitality. Leaves, fish, a crescent moon, a house and numerous linear patterns 
all float in the layered flux of Whitehorse's world. Whitehorse seizes this 
flux and presents it as if a gift, a reminder that the chaos need not be tamed, 
but can be embraced and celebrated for its endless possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
In one of Gail Werner's large acrylic and charcoal works, the affinity between 
human and animal realms peaks in the symbiosis of a human head and three birds. 
The trio of birds fills in where the head form ends above the nose, and the two 
halves of the face -- and by extension, the personality -- become one, the 
contained, crisply defined facial features and the free, restless feathered 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his speech, Chief Seattle asks: "Where is the thicket? Gone. 
Where is the eagle? Gone. The end of living and the beginning of survival." 
Victor Curran's landscape triptychs echo this sense of oppressed, stifled 
nature. One of the drawings reads as a lively mosaic of snugly interlocked 
shapes until the title, "Designated Landscape," transforms it into a view of 
the earth as unfree, compartmentalized, assigned. "Riparian Thicket," too, 
suggests a landscape lost, obstructed, inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
Few other artists in the show pay homage to the theme of Chief Seattle's speech 
in as overt and meaningful a way as these three. Joe Feddersen's 
computer-generated prints impose patterns over a human silhouette in a 
gratuitous display of technical prowess. Michael McCabe and Susan Stewart seem 
to derive their abstract, patterned imagery as much from a generic vocabulary 
of decorator wallpaper as from the spirals and snaking lines of Native American 
art. 
</P>
<P>
Corwin Clairmont's "Trade Goods Series" of laminated photographs and text 
introduces provocative ideas about cultural exchange and the reduction of a 
living culture to a material souvenir, but the work remains stunted at a 
conceptual level, never quite ascending to a level of visual interest. The 
toned and tinted photographs of Carm Little Turtle inject some narrative 
appeal, especially the four-part sequence, "She Wished for a Husband, Two 
Horses and Many Cows." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Lomahaftewa, Armond Lara and Jeanne La Marr are also represented in this 
scattered survey of Native American works on paper, a mixed blessing of a show 
tethered to the profound simplicity of Chief Seattle's words: "What is there to 
life if a man cannot hear the lonely cry of the whippoorwill or the arguments 
of the frogs around a pond at night?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jaune Quick-to-See Smith will give a free lecture about the exhibition and 
Native American art tonight at 7:30 at the Centro Cultural de la Raza.

IT'S TIME TO GO AS HOMES FALL TO LAVA ONE BY ONE

KALAPANA, Hawaii 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anna Sherrell tied her mattress to the top of her hatchback and reached for her 
last box of belongings. A massive black sea of lava ringed with fire was slowly 
pushing toward her, devouring everything in its path. 
</P>
<P>
As the walls of her neighbor's house collapsed in orange cinders, she knew it 
was finally time to go. 
</P>
<P>
For virtually everyone in Kalapana Gardens, it is time to go. Kilauea Volcano, 
better known locally as Madame Pele, the volcano goddess, is obliterating this 
lush community's 120 homes one by one on a relentless march to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking a matter of days," said Harry Kim, civil defense administrator 
for Hawaii County, whose command post overlooks a postcard-perfect black sand 
beach fringed by coconut palms. "Unless this eruption stops, this whole area 
may be devastated." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a mile away, the full force of the lava flow slowly churns through 
the heart of Kalapana Gardens. In just two weeks, the crusty, oozing black mass 
and its red-hot liquid core -- now flowing out of the volcano at a rate of 
630,000 cubic yards a day or as much as 3,000 railroad freight cars could carry 
-- have swallowed 21 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The surge is the latest phase in a seven-year-long Kilauea eruption that has 
poured lava over hundreds of square miles. Moving in fits and starts, it has 
claimed 101 homes to date, including the seaside village of Kapaahu and most of 
Royal Gardens. This week the damage estimate was raised to $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Kalapana Gardens' turn. More than a third of the subdivision has been 
wiped out, and everyone left is on emergency alert, ready to evacuate within 72 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The pace and unpredictability of the flow has made daily life here an agonizing 
guessing game for residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on pins and needles for two weeks waiting for my house to go," said 
Sherrell. "Madame Pele teases you, she comes and goes." 
</P>
<P>
It's a bizarre scene. Down the road from Sherrell's place, one man works day 
and night piling 50-lb. rocks on top of each other in a wall encircling his 
property. He hopes it will stop the onslaught. His neighbors laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Plumeria blossoms give off their captivating scent despite the volcanic tinge 
in the air. In the spaces between the fingers of lava, papaya trees are still 
standing heavy with fruit. The constant crackling of shrubs and trees on fire 
makes an eerie backdrop to the noisy local songbirds. 
</P>
<P>
John Gapp, a transplanted Californian who had hand-built his two-story pole 
house complete with Mexican tile and huge picture windows can now only find 
traces of his dream -- chunks of blue roofing tin embedded in a moonscape of 
rock stacked several feet deep. The lava, denser than cement, won't support 
vegetation again for at least a generation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't talk about my feelings," he said, shaking his head. "On the Mainland, 
your house burns and you can rebuild," sighs his bride, Maureen. "Here you 
can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Like many refugees, the Gapps are staying with friends while they figure out 
what to do next. Others have pitched tents at the beach park. The Red Cross is 
providing meals and containers to store furniture, as well as checks for one 
month's rent to get people started. Larry Tanimoto, the mayor of the island, 
met with Gov. John Waihee Wednesday to plead for a disaster declaration to free 
state and federal help, but so far the governor has not acted. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners with insurance have a leg up. Because the lava torches houses before 
devouring them, fire insurance covers it, unlike most natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Most Kalapana residents moved here in the last 15 years, many lured from the 
West Coast by the setting, the surf and cheap land. Others are transients, 
living on the beach. And then there are those whose families have been here for 
generations. They seem the most philosophical about the volcano. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Yamaguchi, whose general store and drive-in lie just outside the police 
blockade near the flow remains confident that Pele will spare him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunshine, rain, volcano, or no volcano, I work every day the same as usual," 
says the 82-year-old entrepreneur. "I'll never move from here. Never. This is 
my life, my fortune. If she eats this, she's killing me. She wouldn't kill me." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he chuckles, the lava flow is boosting business as tourists flock to 
see nature at work. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Kaawaloa Sr. has a private prayer for the goddess. He points toward the 
nearby Star of the Sea Chapel, and his voice grows soft. He was baptized there 
and married there, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Pele doesn't touch it," he says. "The church didn't do anything wrong. 
We love that church." 
</P>

CUTS IN AIRCRAFT COULD IMPACT OTHER SECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern California aircraft industry is heading for tough times -- and the 
rest of the region's economy is likely to suffer because of it. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposal Thursday for massive cutbacks in four 
major military aircraft programs will slash employment in the sprawling defense 
sector and reverberate throughout Southern California's business community. 
</P>
<P>
Deepening the gloom in the aerospace sector, McDonnell Douglas disclosed 
Thursday that it would cut 3,000 white-collar jobs in commercial and military 
programs at its Douglas Aircraft operation in Long Beach. The company 
attributed the layoffs to continuing problems in the production of commercial 
and military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the military programs proposed by Cheney will bring home to 
Southern California the harsh reality of the cost of peace: fewer jobs and 
greater economic uncertainty. Three of the four aircraft marked for cuts 
Thursday are to be produced in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cheney's proposal is far less severe than outright program 
cancellations might have been, there is more slashing to come. The layoffs that 
have occurred so far reflect congressional spending reductions enacted one to 
three years ago, not any immediate effect from the ebb of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
"These cutbacks in defense have just begun, and they raise some troubling 
questions about the future," said David Hensley, an economist with the UCLA 
business forecasting project. "Deep cuts could push us into an outright 
recession, but in any case we will experience significant pain." 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks unveiled by Cheney amount to $34.835 billion, including $16.835 
billion from 1991 through 1994 and an estimated $18 billion from 1995 through 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cheney did not address the job impact of his decision, the cuts could 
affect as many as 35,000 jobs nationwide over the four years starting in 1991, 
an estimate based on ratios for the average sales per employee in the industry. 
California would bear the brunt of those losses. 
</P>
<P>
The job cutbacks will not come immediately, and the prime contractors may feel 
them last. The first firms to be affected will be small vendors and 
subcontractors that populate aerospace industrial parks in communities like 
Torrance, El Segundo and Anaheim. An estimated 80,482 of these small firms 
already have failed or left the industry, owing to Defense Department policies 
and overcapacity in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The two largest aircraft programs targeted by Cheney, the Northrop B-2 bomber 
and the McDonnell Douglas C-17 cargo jet, face cuts of nearly half of their 
total production quantities. 
</P>
<P>
The two programs account for 20,000 direct jobs in Los Angles County and 
thousands more at subcontractors. Northrop, for example, subcontracts 70% of 
B-2 work. Although Cheney set out annual production schedules for each program, 
it remained uncertain how much the work forces will be slashed. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney would cut total B-2 production from 132 aircraft to 75 and reduce the 
peak production rate from 24 per year to 12 per year. Northrop officials said 
they could not assess how those rate reductions would affect their 12,000 
employees on the program. Northrop announced earlier this month that it was 
laying off 500 B-2 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the original plan to produce B-2s at a rate of 24 per year, the Northrop 
work force would have grown to 13,000 by the mid-1990s, a Northrop spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the total work force is likely to shrink, though probably not as severely 
as might be expected. The 50% cutback in the production rate will not mean a 
50% cutback in employment, Northrop officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The implications for the C-17 program are less clear. It now employs 8,000 
workers, who will not be affected immediately, a Douglas spokesman said. Still, 
any future buildup would be reduced or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Cheney plan, the total procurement of C-17 planes will be cut from 
210 to 120 and the peak production rate would fall from 29 aircraft per year to 
24. Thus, the program will end much earlier under Cheney's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also announced a delay in production of the Air Force's advanced 
tactical fighter, pushing back the start of production from 1994 to 1996. The 
program is in competition between teams led by Northrop and Lockheed, which 
have invested hundreds of millions of dollars of their own funds on the 
money-losing design phase in the hope of recovering profits during production. 
</P>
<P>
The delay in ATF production raises serious doubts that those companies will 
ever earn back their investments, not to mention whether the delay will make 
the technology obsolete by the time the fighter gets into operation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the delay, production of the Navy version of ATF was decreased 
from 618 to 546 aircraft. And the Navy A-12, which is being produced by 
McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics in Tulsa, Okla., will be cut, along with 
an Air Force version. These cuts will also hurt the the subcontractor industry 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Douglas Aircraft attributed its cutback of 3,000 jobs to "poor 
financial performance," a reference to major losses posted through last year in 
commercial aircraft programs and production problems on military programs. The 
firm is losing money on each MD-80 jetliner it builds and is investing 
massively in its new MD-11 jetliner, which has yet to begin deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
A Douglas spokeswoman said the jobs to be eliminated are in the support and 
administrative areas. Those losses could be partly offset, the company said, by 
possible growth in production jobs during 1990. Douglas employment has grown 
from 13,000 in 1984 to 50,000, including operations in Salt Lake City, Utah; 
Columbus, Ohio; Macon, Ga., and Canada. Local employment includes about 37,000 
in Long Beach and 5,000 in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said a majority of the job reductions will occur locally, as 
will the majority of any job growth. Employees who will lose their jobs are to 
be notified by June and the jobs eliminated by August. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has failed in its wide-ranging efforts during the past year to restore 
its financial health. A company announcement said cuts in such areas as 
utilities, supplies, and facilities have failed to cut costs enough, forcing 
the job terminations. 
</P>
<P>
Some employees, who have long complained that Douglas was operating 
inefficiently, were not convinced that the new cutbacks would help. "They 
probably have another 3,000 they could get rid of if they really sharpened 
their pencils," one veteran worker said. "The productivity just isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Cooper, chief economist for Security Pacific Bank, took a more upbeat 
view of the disclosures Thursday, saying that California should weather the 
cutbacks much better than in past downturns. 
</P>
<P>
"We are only half as dependent on defense as we were 20 years ago and that 
helps us," she said. "There is no state in the country that has as diverse an 
economy as California. I am sure these events will affect Southern California, 
but it is going to be less severe than it was in the late 1960s. The cutbacks 
will be a good deal less than they were after the Vietnam War, and we are more 
diversified." 
</P>
<P>
She said the state might even attract additional defense work in the downturn. 
"We have a work force that is highly technically oriented that does not exist 
in other parts of the country. I would not be surprised to see greater 
concentration in jobs and research in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
But Hensley, the UCLA economist, takes a more guarded view of the future. He 
believes that defense is "one of the state's biggest vulnerabilities." If 
Pentagon budgets drop annually by 10% in 1991 and 1992, Hensley said, the state 
could lose 150,000 jobs, which includes secondary effects outside the defense 
industry. Such cutbacks would go much further than just the aircraft programs 
affected by Cheney's announcement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Paulson, director for aerospace activities at the consulting firm 
McKinsey &amp; Co., agrees that the industry could face an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has lost backlog," he said. "We are again lowering the expected 
utilization of the industrial base. So now, every program will be more 
expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the cutbacks "will certainly drive more people out of the industry. It 
is going to hurt efficiency and, to the extent that new programs are where new 
technology is developed, it is going to age the technology of the industry."

<P>
Taking a strong stand against corruption in the state Capitol, a federal judge 
Thursday sentenced former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya to 6 1/2 years in prison for 
selling his vote to special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Milton L. Schwartz, delivering a stern lecture, told 
Montoya that his crimes had undermined representative government in California 
and ordered him to pay $40,000 in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The system can live with people who are not terribly competent," Schwartz 
said. "It can live with legislators who may be lazy. But it cannot survive 
legislators who say, 'My vote is for sale. I am here to vote the way I am 
paid.' " 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, a Democrat from Whittier, remained impassive as Schwartz imposed the 
prison sentence. But the former lawmaker's wife, Pilar, broke into tears in the 
first row of the spectators' section. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement to the judge moments before the sentencing, Montoya said 
he accepted his conviction on seven counts of racketeering, extortion and money 
laundering. "I believe in the (legal) system," Montoya told the judge. "The 
system has found me guilty. I will live with the consequences and so will my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
But he lashed out at the media, charging that it had "tried and convicted me 
before I came to trial." 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing of Montoya brings to a close the most important case so far in a 
five-year federal investigation of corruption in the Legislature. U.S. Atty. 
David F. Levi, who personally helped prosecute Montoya, said the stiff prison 
term sends a clear message to other lawmakers not to use their positions for 
their personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an appropriate and powerful sentence," Levi said. "The message I hope 
it sends is one of deterrence to all public officials in all walks of 
government life who would contemplate trading the power of their postion for 
some kind of financial gain." 
</P>
<P>
Under federal sentencing rules, Montoya will spend at least 5 1/2 years behind 
bars, Levi said. Because of a recent change in federal law, he will be eligible 
for a sentence reduction of no more than 54 days a year for good behavior, 
beginning only after the first year. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Montoya made a dramatic entrance into the courthouse Thursday morning, 
reaching out and shoving a camera into the face of a news photographer who 
received a cut just above an eye. 
</P>
<P>
The altercation with United Press International photographer Dan Groschong 
began when the Montoyas and several friends attempted to push their way through 
a throng of news people gathered in the courthouse lobby. During the shoving, 
Groschong said Pilar Montoya grabbed a flash attachment cable attached to one 
of two cameras he was carrying. When he tried to take a picture with the second 
camera, Groschong said, Montoya struck it with an open hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're just real upset," Groschong said afterward. "I would be." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Montoya, who was convicted in February, argued that as a 
first-time offender who had used his elected office for the good of many 
constituents, he should serve little or no jail time. 
</P>
<P>
But in calculating the sentence, Schwartz agreed with prosecutors who had urged 
a stiffer penalty for the former senator on the grounds that he had engaged in 
obstruction of justice during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz ruled that Montoya lied on the witness stand and withheld key 
documents that had been subpoenaed by federal authorities. As a result, the 
judge tacked on 15 months more than Montoya might otherwise have received. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who presided over Montoya's trial, expressed sympathy for the former 
senator's family and said he received 65 letters from supporters urging 
leniency. "I recognize he has done a lot of very fine things for a lot of 
people," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
But evidence at the trial showed that Montoya repeatedly used his position to 
extort money from special-interest groups, Schwartz said, citing "a number of 
situations extending over a period of more than seven years in which his vote 
was for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims of Montoya's attempted extortion were representatives of the 
National Football League Players' Assn., former sports agent Michael Trope, a 
Florida insurance executive, representatives of foreign medical universities 
and an undercover FBI agent posing as a businessman, the jury found. The most 
dramatic evidence against the senator was a videotape of Montoya accepting a 
$3,000 payment from the FBI agent at a breakfast meeting near the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most serious kind of white-collar crime because it attacks every 
person and because it attacks the ability to have representative government," 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Michael S. Sands said afterward that the sentence was "totally 
devastating" for Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
But several members of the jury that convicted Montoya, who were on hand for 
the sentencing, said they thought the penalty was too light. "To me, that seems 
like a slap on the wrist," said Ed Reece as he left the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Greg Coumis said he believed the judge should have ordered Montoya to pay 
a much larger fine because it was the former legislator's avarice that prompted 
his illegal activities. "The whole trial was based on money," Coumis said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz gave the former legislator two months to file any legal appeals and 
get his personal affairs in order before turning himself in to federal 
authorities on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would recommend that Montoya serve his time at the Lompoc 
Federal Penitentiary, a minimum-security prison with a reputation as one of the 
softest in the federal system. 
</P>
<P>
Before pronouncing the sentence, Schwartz rejected a motion by Sands for a new 
trial. The attorney argued that the verdict was tainted because a potential 
witness on one of the counts refused to testify at the trial, citing his Fifth 
Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya's attorneys said they hoped the former senator, who resigned his post 
after his conviction, would remain free pending his appeal. But Levi said that 
unless a court finds that a reversal of the verdict is likely, Montoya will 
have to begin serving his sentence while his case is under review.

Gov. George Deukmejian played an influential role in the events that led W. Ann 
Reynolds to resign last week as chancellor of the California State University 
system, sources close to the events say. 
</P>
<P>
Angry because Reynolds secretly engineered huge pay raises for herself and 
other top CSU administrators, Deukmejian made it clear to members of the CSU 
Board of Trustees -- most of whom are his appointees -- that he would not 
object to the chancellor's dismissal, trustees and others told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
They said the governor was particularly upset because Reynolds had taken the 
action at a time when the governor is trying to persuade a skeptical electorate 
to double the state gasoline tax and when the public holds politicians in 
generally low repute. 
</P>
<P>
Key Deukmejian trustee appointees, including Chairman Marianthi Lansdale, 
Martha C. Fallgatter and J. Gary Shansby, contacted the governor's office 
before last week's special trustees' meeting in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"The message from the governor was clear," said one trustee who asked not to be 
identified. "He was upset with the salary thing and the way it was handled, he 
thought the raises should be rescinded and he thought it should be resolved 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Several trustees said the board was prepared to remove Reynolds by an 
overwhelming vote when she beat them to it by resigning during the special 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"If Deukmejian had decided to back her, that would have changed some votes," a 
trustee said. 'He may even have been able to save her, I don't know.' 
</P>
<P>
It was an uncharacteristic role for the governor, who seldom has involved 
himself in these kinds of personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But Peter G. Mehas, Deukmejian's education assistant, said the governor thought 
the huge pay raises, approved without public discussion, made it more difficult 
to win voter support for Proposition 111 by raising questions about how public 
money is spent. Proposition 111 would double the state gasoline tax over the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Reynolds' recommendation, the trustees agreed late last year to raise 
the chancellor's salary 43%, from $136,248 to $195,000. They also raised those 
of six vice chancellors and 20 campus presidents by amounts ranging from 21% to 
28%. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees rescinded those raises last Friday, limiting the chancellor and 
other top officials to the same 4.18% average pay raise that the faculty and 
staff will receive. 
</P>
<P>
"What bothered us the most," Mehas said, "was that I'm supposed to read the 
agendas for these meetings and alert the governor about possible controversial 
issues . . . but this salary item appeared on no agenda -- we were caught 
completely by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mehas said, "clearly, the governor did not in any way affect the 
outcome." 
</P>
<P>
And Robert J. Gore, the governor's press secretary, said Deukmejian was 
"advised and updated" as the trustees gathered in Oakland but that he "played 
no significant role" in the events that led to Reynolds' resignation. 
</P>
<P>
However, several trustees and other sources said that when Reynolds realized 
she could expect support neither from the governor, who serves as an ex-officio 
board member, nor from the three Democratic officeholders who are also 
ex-officio members -- Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
and state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig -- she decided to resign.

SPACE: SCIENTISTS ENCOUNTER 'MORE PROBLEMS THAN WE ANTICIPATED,' BUT THEY ARE 
STILL CONFIDENT.

The Hubble Space Telescope spent its first full day in orbit Thursday 
tormenting the engineers and scientists on the ground who would be its masters. 
</P>
<P>
As it orbited 381 miles above the Earth, 50 miles in front of the shuttle 
Discovery, the $1.5 billion telescope balked at communicating with ground 
controllers and played the leading role in a series of dramas that had the 
experts gnawing on their fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we've had a lot more problems than we had anticipated," said 
Michael M. Harrington, director of orbital verification at the Goddard Space 
Flight Center here. But he quickly added that he is "confident" that he and his 
fellow engineers will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
The most threatening problem began just as Harrington was showing up for work. 
The previous shift had failed in its attempts to establish communications with 
the telescope through its twin high-gain antennas. The telescope also has a 
secondary communications system, but the high-gain antennas will be the primary 
means for transmitting scientific data back from the telescope, and the loss 
would have been catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington's team determined that the communications link had failed because 
the telescope probably was not pointing exactly where they thought it was, and 
thus the antennas were not pointing at the sophisticated communications 
satellite that serves as NASA's link to its space vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The orientation of the telescope is determined partly by "fixed star trackers," 
small telescopes on board the Hubble that reveal the locations of various stars 
whose positions are well known. That information tells ground controllers how 
much and which way to move the telescope so that it is pointing in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
After analyzing data from the star trackers, controllers ordered the telescope 
to move and the antennas locked on the communications satellite and the vital 
link was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Then a problem cropped up with the secondary communications system which allows 
the telescope to accept orders from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
That left ground controllers wondering about how they were going to order the 
telescope to do anything at all, but within a few tense minutes that problem 
was resolved too. Engineers determined that it was a human failure on the 
ground, not a hardware failure in orbit, that caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The problems came at the very beginning of what will be a long process -- 
testing and fine tuning the guidance system that will allow astronomers to 
study distant objects for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope has the finest mirror ever produced, but it would be useless 
without a guidance system that will point the telescope at specific targets and 
hold it "locked on" for hours. Controllers are expected to work for months 
getting the guidance system perfected. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the requirement to point very precisely that makes the checkout period 
so long," said Steve Terry, an orbital verification official at Goddard. "This 
is the first baby step." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, satellites use tiny jets to keep them properly oriented, but even the 
smallest jets would foul the neighborhood around the space telescope, thus 
negating the reason for putting it in orbit above the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope uses four large flywheels to move it. As each flywheel spins, the 
telescope tends to rotate in the direction of the spinning. It works the other 
way around just as well. Thus controllers can move the telescope in any 
direction just by controlling the spin of the flywheels. But Thursday, while 
engineers were still getting acquainted with their new toy, one of the 
flywheels stopped. It was later restarted after engineers determined that the 
problem was simply a faulty sensor. 
</P>
<P>
Without at least three of the four flywheels, it would not be possible to point 
the telescope accurately, so the problem caused a lot of consternation here for 
awhile. 
</P>
<P>
How accurate does the pointing have to be? To within .007 seconds of arc, said 
Edward J. Weiler, program scientist at NASA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"That's equivalent to if you had a laser beam in Washington and you fired it at 
New York, you would be able to hit a dime," Weiler said. 
</P>
<P>
"And more importantly, you would be able to hold that beam on that dime for 24 
hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the telescope will pass another milestone when ground controllers order 
it to open its "aperture door," which serves as a lens cap to prevent sunlight 
from accidentally entering the telescope and burning out some of the 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
If that procedure works properly, Discovery, which has been shadowing the 
telescope ever since it was released Wednesday, will be free to make its 6:49 
a.m. landing Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
If the aperture door should jam, however, the shuttle will pull alongside the 
telescope Saturday and astronauts Kathryn D. Sullivan and Bruce McCandless will 
go outside and try to fix it.

PANEL TELLS OF CHILDREN'S POVERTY, NEGLECT; 
</P>
<P>
CARE SERVICES: U.S. COMMISSION SAYS TOO MANY YOUNGSTERS ARE 'UNHEALTHY' AND 
'LACKING DIRECTION.' IT CALLS THEM 'THE POOREST GROUP IN AMERICA.'

A federal commission Thursday painted a troubling portrait of America's 
children, saying too many are reaching adulthood "unhealthy, illiterate, 
unemployable and lacking both moral direction and a vision of a secure future." 
</P>
<P>
The National Commission on Children, releasing its interim report to the 
President and Congress, said current realities "raise serious questions about 
the reach and effectiveness of existing public and private sector policies and 
programs to support children and their families." 
</P>
<P>
Calling children "the poorest group in America," the commission said that one 
out of every five children is living in poverty -- in urban areas it is one out 
of every three -- and that too many children are entering school "unprepared" 
to learn. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the report said, the nation's health care policies have "harsh and 
senseless consequences" for children. It noted that an estimated 10.6 million 
children, or 19%, lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also said that drug and alcohol use by parents, as well as 
drug-related crime and violence, is as much a threat to children as the use of 
drugs by children themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, "this is a personal tragedy for the young people involved and a 
staggering loss for the nation as a whole," said Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller 
IV (D-W. Va.), commission chairman. "The health and vitality of our economy and 
our democracy are in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Advocacy groups have been saying many of the same things in recent years, but 
the panel's findings are expected to bring added credibility and influence on 
policy-making because of its broad membership and bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
"While some of the data in the report will not shock those who work with poor 
children every day, this report will reach millions of Americans who are 
unaware of the desperate plight of America's poor children," said James Weill, 
general counsel for the Children's Defense Fund. "It is a stage-setting 
document." 
</P>
<P>
The commission is a 36-member bipartisan panel appointed by the President and 
Congress to develop a national blueprint of action for America's children. It 
includes members of Congress and other public officials, child health and 
development experts and representatives of advocacy, labor and business groups. 
</P>
<P>
The commission made no recommendations Thursday, saying its interim report was 
meant to lay out "emerging themes" that will likely form the basis for its 
final report, due in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The commission predicted that the recommendations in its final report "will be 
bold, and . . . will require the attention of every American" and "will almost 
certainly entail difficult choices about national priorities in an era of 
limited new public resources." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the panel said, "the country is not doing enough to ensure that 
adults -- starting with parents -- give children the time and attention they 
need for a good start in life." 
</P>
<P>
To learn, "children must be healthy, fed, rested and secure," the report said. 
Yet an increasing number of children are not getting the "nurturing, care and 
support they need in their early years to start school ready and able to 
learn," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, while increasing numbers of 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in 
early education programs, low-income and minority children are less likely to 
be among them, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many are entering school systems "that are rigid and inflexible" at a 
time when conditions in many children's lives call for more flexibility, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of health care, the report said, almost 40,000 babies die every 
year in the United States before they reach their first birthdays. Appropriate 
prenatal care can reduce the incidence of infant death and disability, the 
report said. Nevertheless, almost 25% of all live births in 1986 -- the latest 
figures available -- were to women who did not begin prenatal care during the 
first three months of pregnancy, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the report said, many childhood diseases, disabilities and deaths 
could be avoided through preventive care, such as immunizations. "Instead, they 
continue to cause pain and grief to children and families and cost the nation 
billions in health care services," the report said.

A pregnant patient's decision to refuse medical treatment is almost always 
paramount, even when survival of a fetus is at stake, the District of 
Columbia's highest court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in a widely watched case is binding only in the district, but it 
is expected to influence other courts wrestling with questions of maternal and 
fetal rights in connection with medical treatment and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold that in virtually all cases the question of what is to be done is to 
be decided by the patient -- the pregnant woman -- on behalf of herself and the 
fetus," the D.C. Court of Appeals said in a 7-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not quite foreclose the possibility" that the patient's wishes may be 
overridden, the panel said, "but we anticipate that such cases will be 
extremely rare and truly exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled in the case of Angela Carder, 27, a terminal cancer patient 
pregnant with a 26-week-old fetus. The D.C. Superior Court found it unclear 
what the heavily sedated Carder wanted done with the fetus and told George 
Washington University Hospital to perform an emergency Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
The premature infant died 2 1/2 hours after the surgery; her mother died two 
days later. The Cesarean section was listed as a contributing cause of Carder's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the majority, Judge John A. Terry said the lower court should have 
tried to determine what Carder would have wanted to happen had she been able to 
make a clear decision. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the judge wrote, the court proceeded straight to a "balancing 
analysis" weighing Carder's rights against the interests of the state -- in 
this case the survival of the fetus -- and found for the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate opinion, Judge James A. Belson said he agreed with the lower 
court's decision to weigh the interests of Carder, her fetus and the state. The 
judge said an unborn child's interests and the state's interest in preserving 
human life are entitled to "substantial weight" when they are in conflict with 
a patient's decision on medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women, 
which fought the court-ordered procedure, said the appeals court decision 
affirmed the rights of pregnant women to control their own medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU said the decision "stands as solid authority" for rejecting the idea 
that a fetus has rights superseding those of a person already born. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorney Lynn Paltrow, who brought the case, said the lower court treated 
Carder as if she were dead. "The bottom line is you can't deny women their 
civil rights. You can't treat women as dead just because they're pregnant," she 
said.

Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud Party, 
was chosen Thursday to try to form a government after Labor Party leader Shimon 
Peres failed to forge what he called a peace coalition. 
</P>
<P>
A Shamir-led government could spell trouble for U.S. efforts to arrange a 
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has opposed the U.S. plan while Peres backs it. 
</P>
<P>
Peres predicted that Shamir will also fail to form a government but contended 
that if he succeeds, he will create "an extremist right-wing government the 
like of which Israel never had." 
</P>
<P>
Peres called President Chaim Herzog on Thursday and announced, as expected, 
that he was unable to break a 60-60 standoff in Israel's 120-seat Knesset 
(Parliament). Thursday was the deadline on an extension granted by Herzog. 
Peres, 66, spent nearly six weeks trying to forge an alliance of ultra-Orthodox 
religious parties and small, left-wing factions. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog's office said he will give the job to Shamir, head of the caretaker 
government that took over after Parliament voted to end the Labor-Likud 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
If Shamir is unable to form a government, national elections may have to be 
called.

ISRAEL'S HIGH COURT ORDERS EVICTION OF JEWISH GROUP 
</P>

<P>
Israel's Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the eviction of Jewish settlers who 
stirred an international outcry by moving into a building in the Christian 
Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. 
</P>
<P>
In its ruling, the three-judge panel said the settlers, affiliated with the 
Ateret Cohanim seminary, must leave by Tuesday. The settlers said they will 
comply. A lower court earlier ordered them to leave, but the order was appealed 
and had never been enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Greek Orthodox Church, which owns the building, said they are 
still dissatisfied because Thursday's ruling allows maintenance workers and 20 
guards hired by the settlers to remain until a lower court resolves the tenancy 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The church argues that the settlers are in the building under an illegal 
sublease. It reaffirmed plans to close all Christian shrines in the Holy Land 
today to protest the presence of the settlers. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlers moved into the Hospice of St. John complex during Easter 
Week. The action brought protests from Christian clerics, Palestinian 
Christians and Muslims, the U.S. State Department and pro-Israeli lobby groups. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, it was disclosed that the Israeli government had funneled $1.8 
million through a Panamanian company to help pay for the hospice lease. The 
government contends that Jews have the right to live anywhere in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The walled Old City has traditionally been divided into Muslim, Christian, 
Jewish and Armenian quarters, each with holy sites. 
</P>
<P>
Avraham Sochovolsky, attorney for the Greek Orthodox church, claimed victory in 
the Supreme Court ruling. "Twenty people is not a settlement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But a church spokesman, Bishop Timothy Margaritis, said the court did not go 
far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We were expecting that the building would be evacuated completely and that 
somebody else would undertake to guard the place," he said. "Now, it's like 
recognizing the rights of the Panamanian company." 
</P>
<P>
The Panama-based company SBC says it subleased St. John's from an Armenian 
Christian and that the settlers are its guests. But the church says the 
Christian involved had no right to sublet. It has filed separate eviction 
orders against him and SBC. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the U.S. State Department said it was "dismayed by 
reports" that Israel started two new settlements in the occupied territories. 
Construction has been going on at Dugit in the Gaza Strip and Allon in the West 
Bank.

SMILING POLHILL ARRIVES IN U.S. TO SUBDUED WELCOME; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGES: THE WHITE HOUSE CRITICIZES CONGRESS FOR A RESOLUTION IT INDICATES MAY 
JEOPARDIZE THE RELEASE OF OTHER CAPTIVES.

<P>
Freed hostage Robert Polhill grinned broadly and gave the thumbs-up sign in a 
sun-drenched but subdued homecoming here Thursday as the White House criticized 
Congress for passing a resolution that could undermine other hostage releases. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force jet flew Polhill, his Lebanese wife, Firyal, and his two grown 
sons by his first marriage from West Germany. The former hostage, released 
Sunday in Beirut and turned over to American officials in Damascus, Syria, had 
been taken to a U.S. military hospital in Wiesbaden for medical examinations 
and debriefing. 
</P>
<P>
On the tarmac at Andrews, the 55-year-old Polhill shook hands with the 
assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, Elizabeth Tamposi, and the 
base's vice commander. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill did not stop to respond to reporters' shouted questions, telling them, 
"I can't." He smiled and made a throat-cutting gesture to underscore the point, 
then was whisked away in a sedan past about 60 spectators, most of them 
uniformed Air Force personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as he entered Walter Reed Army Medical Center for several days of 
physical rehabilitation and neurological examinations, he told reporters in a 
hoarse voice, "I'm very happy, very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Before Polhill's arrival, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater rebuked 
the House for its passage Tuesday of a resolution recognizing Jerusalem as 
Israel's capital and declaring that it "must remain an undivided city." 
</P>
<P>
The United States keeps its embassy in Tel Aviv and officially recognizes no 
Israeli capital. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that "Congress needs to consider these resolutions more seriously," 
Fitzwater said the House move "can have unintended consequences" for the seven 
American hostages remaining in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lebanese Shiite Muslim leader Hussein Moussawi, a reputed mentor 
of the pro-Iranian kidnapers who freed Polhill, said the resolution would 
complicate efforts to free other hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution's chief sponsor, Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), called the White 
House comments "absolutely ridiculous. The fact is, these terrorists will 
release these hostages when it's in their best interest to do so. . . . The 
U.S. Congress will not bow to their pressure." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed by a 378-34 vote, came in response to President Bush's 
statement last month that Israel should stop settling Soviet Jewish emigres in 
East Jerusalem, which Israel wrested from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War. The 
Senate on March 22 passed a similar resolution. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman played down the House resolution as "non-binding," 
and he added: "We feel the Congress is entitled to express its view. We can't 
control that." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the resolution would compromise release efforts, he said, "We 
remain hopeful that more will be released." 
</P>
<P>
However, the special U.S. hostage debriefing team assembled for Polhill's 
release flew out of Wiesbaden on Thursday, indicating the declining short-term 
prospects for another hostage release. 
</P>
<P>
A four-room suite at Walter Reed has been reserved for Polhill and his wife, 
who are expected to travel next week to a festive greeting in his native 
upstate New York.

NO SANCTIONS ON IRAQ PLANNED, U.S. OFFICIAL TELLS HOUSE PANEL

The Bush Administration on Thursday reiterated its opposition to sanctions 
against Iraq, resisting pressure from congressional members who argued that it 
should be penalized for threatening its Mideast neighbors and gassing its own 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly, citing Iraq's oil reserves and 
military strength, said that improved U.S.-Iraqi relations could help bring 
stability to the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there is a positive opportunity for change in behavior in Iraq, so 
there will be no imposition of sanctions," Kelly told the House Foreign Affairs 
subcommittee on Europe and the Near East. 
</P>
<P>
"With all due respect, I detect an Alice in Wonderland character in your 
testimony," retorted California Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo). "You talk about 
Iraq using poison gas on its own people . . . its ambassadors engaging in 
assassination and the attempted smuggling of weapons parts. You do a dichotomy 
between words and deeds." 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who recently introduced 
legislation calling for sanctions against Iraq, charged that Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein "is a dangerous and unpredictable dictator." 
</P>
<P>
"He gassed 5,000 of his own citizens to death and he has threatened to turn 
weapons of mass destruction against his neighbors," Berman said. "There are 
weekly reports of Iraqi attempts to steal advanced weapons technology." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly cited as positive indicators Hussein's expulsion of the Abu Nidal 
terrorist organization and Iraq's participation in U.S.-led disarmament 
conferences on chemical weapons. He said Iraqi representatives told him 
recently that the government may provide more freedoms and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
But congressional members favoring sanctions cited Iraq's use of chemical 
weapons in killing an estimated 5,000 Kurdish rebels and civilians during the 
Iran -- Iraq War. They also noted Iraq's attempt in March to smuggle U.S.-made 
electronic devices that could be used to trigger nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators focused on a Hussein speech earlier this month in which he 
threatened to "burn up half of Israel" with chemical weapons if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said Iraqi officials explained to him that Hussein meant he would carry 
out such a threat only if Israel attacked Iraq with nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Berman legislation would bar the export of certain technologies, loans to 
Iraq from international financial institutions and would deny export-import 
credits to companies dealing with Iraq.

A heavily armed gang of teen-agers riddled an apartment with gunfire Thursday, 
killing a 4-year-old girl as she slept on a couch, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Rose Carr died after being struck in the chest by one of between 40 and 
50 bullets fired into her apartment by at least five teen-age boys with 
semi-automatic weapons, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Sgt. Tom King said the violence began Wednesday when a 15-year-old boy 
argued with a teen-age girl at the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand there has been some altercation between the boys and the 
residents of the apartment for about a week," King said, adding that police had 
not determined the nature of the argument. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested two youths, 15 and 16, and were questioning them about the 
shooting.

LUGGAGE WITH 24 GOLD BRICKS DESCRIBED AT MARCOS TRIAL;

With suitcase loads of prosecution evidence against her literally piling up at 
her feet, former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos broke down sobbing 
Thursday at her fraud and racketeering trial, which was then suspended for the 
day as her blood pressure soared. 
</P>
<P>
The interruption came moments after a U.S. Customs agent took the stand and 
began identifying several extremely heavy suitcases that were among the 300 to 
400 examined when Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, deposed dictator Ferdinand 
Marcos, arrived in Hawaii after fleeing a popular uprising in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Contents of the suitcases, still to be detailed, include business and legal 
documents as well as a "tremendous amount of jewels and luxury items as well as 
money," agent Leslie Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos, 60, began to cry when the customs officer testified that in one 
piece of luggage he had found an embossed case inscribed: "To my husband on our 
24th wedding anniversary." It contained "24 bricks of gold" weighing about 2.2 
pounds each, worth a total of approximately $300,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
The former first lady, whose husband died last September, broke into loud sobs 
after the jury was excused for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Gesturing at the suitcases stacked next to the defense table she cried: "They 
should include the dead body of Ferdinand Marcos there." She spoke bitterly of 
her mementos being confiscated by U.S. authorities, then she collapsed into a 
chair, comforted by attorney Gerry Spence and her son, Ferdinand Jr. 
</P>
<P>
She was escorted to the federal courthouse infirmary where she was examined by 
a family doctor who was attending the trial. The doctor said her blood pressure 
was very high and was fluctuating rapidly and recommended immediate rest. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in Judge John Keenan's chambers, Spence reported that Mrs. Marcos was 
feeling better. "She is up and wants to come back and (she) asked to come 
back," he said, but added: "The doctor says . . . that her blood pressure 
continues to climb and that she should not come back right now." 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon session was canceled but the trial was expected to resume today. 
Mrs. Marcos is accused of looting her nation and skimming hundreds of millions 
of dollars out of government banks and agencies to make secret investments in 
jewelry, fine art and New York real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Spence called Mrs. Marcos "a strong and courageous woman" who was under 
considerable stress at the sight of luggage that she hadn't seen since her 
arrival in Hawaii four years ago. He said she was reliving "one of the saddest 
days of her life." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Cassiday, another defense attorney, accused government prosecutors of 
"ganging up on the widow" and using "below the belt tactics." He said testimony 
about the anniversary gold bars was irrelevant to the criminal allegations and, 
therefore, unfair to use in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, Thursday was one of the most devastating days of the trial for 
Mrs. Marcos as physical evidence and testimony against her mounted. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Manila businessman testified that he was forced to turn over 60% 
ownership of his stevedoring company to a brother of Mrs. Marcos in order to 
keep a government contract to operate in the port of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Razon, founder of the stevedoring firm E. Razon Inc., said that just 
prior to the expiration of his long-term contract with the government's port 
authority in late 1978 he was approached by Alfredo Romualdez, a younger 
brother of the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
Razon said he was told that "other people close to Malacanang (the Philippines 
equivalent of the White House) were interested" in obtaining the port contract. 
Romualdez said "give me 60% and perhaps we can keep you there," Razon recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me it was for President Marcos," Razon testified. He said 60% of his 
ownership was transferred to the Marcos relative, the name of his company was 
changed to Metroport and he won renewal of the port contract. 
</P>
<P>
Razon also testified that Marcos pressured him in 1981 to lie on an application 
for $30 million in foreign exchange credits from the Central Bank of the 
Philippines. He said two emissaries from President Marcos told him he had to 
fabricate the request or he would lose a government-guaranteed loan vital to a 
lucrative foreign contract his company had won. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the Marcoses used the $30 million to secretly purchase 
a Manhattan skyscraper, the Crown Building.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS SEE NO CANCER RISK FROM FLUORIDATED WATER 
</P>

Federal health officials said Thursday that there is no evidence that use of 
fluoride in the nation's water supplies should be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
The statement of continued support for fluoridation came after a panel of 
experts convened by the Public Health Service called recent studies linking 
sodium fluoride to the development of a rare bone cancer in rodents equivocal. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no information available at this time that would indicate a need for 
any change in the Public Health Service policy of continued support for the use 
of fluorides for the prevention of tooth decay," said Dr. James O. Mason, 
assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
The panel of experts was convened after preliminary results of a two-year study 
of rats and mice showed a possible association between exposure to very high 
doses of sodium fluoride and the development of osteosarcoma, a rare form of 
bone cancer in male rats. The study was conducted by the health department's 
National Toxicology Program. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results, released in February, found that when 80 rats received 
doses of 79 parts per million, four contracted cancer. At doses of 45 parts per 
million, one case was observed in a male rat. 
</P>
<P>
Humans living in areas served by water supplies with fluoride levels considered 
optimal for prevention of tooth decay drink water containing about 1 part per 
million, the department said. The recommended upper limit for naturally 
occurring fluoride in water supplies is 4 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
Only two cities in Los Angeles County have fluoridated water -- Long Beach and 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said Thursday's action was one step in a continuing evaluation of the 
health risks and benefits of fluoridation under way by the Public Health 
Service. The panel's findings will be incorporated into a broader review of 
other animal and human studies involving fluoride now being conducted by a 
subcommittee established by the department. 
</P>
<P>
David G. Hoel, acting director of the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences, said in February, after the studies were released, that years 
of water fluoridation involving "scores of human epidemiological studies" in 
the United States and in other countries had shown no evidence of a 
relationship between fluoridation and cancer or other diseases in humans.

<P>
Clifton R. Wharton, the first black American career diplomat in the U.S. 
Foreign Service to reach the rank of career minister and ambassador, has died 
at the age of 90. 
</P>
<P>
He died Monday in Phoenix, where he resided. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton rose through the ranks of the service in his 40-year career and 
ultimately was appointed ambassador to Norway in 1961 by President John F. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
He also was an alternate representative of the United States at the United 
Nations in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton was the first black to be assigned as minister to a non-black country, 
the first to attain the rank of career minister and the first to become an 
ambassador through the career service. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Baltimore, he earned several degrees from Boston University and was the 
first black to pass the Foreign Service exam in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
He soon was appointed vice consul and second secretary in Liberia, where Edward 
Dudley, another black, had been the first U.S. ambassador from 1948 to 1953. 
</P>
<P>
From 1930 to 1941, Wharton served as consul in Las Palmas, Spain, and from 1936 
to 1942 held four temporary assignments to Liberia as charge d'affaires. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to serve as a consul in Tananarive, Madagascar, a maritime consul in 
the Azores, Portugal, and consul general and first secretary in Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
President Dwight D. Eisenhower named Wharton envoy extraordinary and minister 
plenipotentiary to Romania in 1958. He retired in 1964.

VICE ADM. GORDON MCLINTOCK; HEADED MERCHANT MARINE ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Adm. Gordon McLintock, who headed the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy on New 
York's Long Island for 22 years, has died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
McLintock died Monday of bone cancer at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Born into a British seagoing family, McLintock first went to sea when he was 3 
aboard a ship on which his father served as an officer. One of his grandfathers 
was head of a major shipyard and the other owned a Mediterranean fleet of 
sailing vessels. 
</P>
<P>
From 1918 to 1920, McLintock was a cadet in the British merchant navy. Moving 
his home base to New York when his family moved there in 1920, the young sailor 
became quartermaster on the Lewis Luckenbach, at the time the world's largest 
cargo vessel. 
</P>
<P>
When he was only 24, McLintock became master of a Pan American Petroleum &amp; 
Transport Co. tanker, the youngest merchant mariner in command of an 
ocean-going vessel. 
</P>
<P>
He became a naturalized American citizen in 1921, and from 1930 on spent his 
career in federal service. He first worked as a Department of Commerce 
steamship inspector and during World War II was chief inspection officer for 
the War Shipping Administration and the U.S. Maritime Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, five years after the Merchant Marine Academy was created at King's 
Point on Long Island, he became its fourth superintendent. During his 22-year 
tenure, the academy became an accredited four-year institution offering college 
degrees to the officers it trained for the U.S. merchant marine. 
</P>
<P>
President of the American Institute of Navigation for two years, McLintock 
represented the United States at several international conferences. He was 
promoted to vice admiral on his retirement from the academy in 1970, and later 
served on a congressional panel to evaluate U.S. service academies. 
</P>
<P>
McLintock is survived by his wife, the former Muriel Thoms Bristow.

NUMBER OF CHILDREN GOING TO FOSTER HOMES GROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of California children going into foster homes is increasing at an 
alarming rate, and until preventive measures are taken the figure is expected 
to continue rising, according to a report issued Thursday by a coalition of 
children's welfare groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Chief Probation Officers Assn. of California, the County Welfare Directors 
Assn. of California, the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services 
and 14 other groups released the report during a news conference at a 
children's service center in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The report's findings support a pair of legislative proposals that would direct 
more of the state's child welfare money to services that will help families 
remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
"Our state is really upside down in the way it approaches the family care 
issue," said Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), author of the two bills. 
"Our attention has all gone into placing children in foster homes -- the most 
expensive and least effective use of money." 
</P>
<P>
The report states that California has "over-invested" in foster care programs, 
and that for every $10 of the $875 million spent last year on housing displaced 
children in California, about $1 is spent on programs that try to keep children 
and their parents together. Los Angeles County alone spent $186 million for 
foster care last year. 
</P>
<P>
Because so little money went to preventive programs, the number of children in 
out-of-home care statewide increased by 65% between 1985 and 1989, the report 
said. More disturbing, the report stated, the number of infants in foster care 
rose by 235% during the same period. In the state, about 4,400 infants were in 
foster care in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Powell, a consultant to Bronzan, said his bill takes into account the 
"disproportionately high number of minority children who are being placed" 
outside of the home. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill states that preference be given to serving minority communities," she 
said. "We are not doing a very good job of reaching those families." 
</P>
<P>
Many factors lead to children being separated from their parents, said Los 
Angeles County Superior Court Judge Paul Boland. Parents' drug use, their lack 
of parenting knowledge and a lack of affordable child care are some, said 
Boland, who presides over the court's juvenile departments. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly bill proposes that some of the funds now being used for foster 
care be applied to drug treatment, parenting instruction -- particularly 
classes for new mothers -- and an emergency fund to help pay for minor home 
repairs, furniture, and unexpected transportation costs, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 cases of child abuse or neglect entered the county court system 
last year. In about two-thirds of those cases, Boland said, the child was sent 
to live with relatives, in a county-funded group home, or with a foster family. 
Boland estimated that half of the "out-of-home placements" can be avoided if 
more emphasis were placed on prevention.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE TV CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Reich, Elements of the ads, with an analysis by Times staff writer 
Kenneth Reich 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Insurance Commissioner. Whose ads? Democratic candidates Conway 
Collis and Bill Press. 
</P>
<P>
Collis has a 30-second commercial and Press three 10-second commercials. Each 
candidate is trying to get across the same point: That he is the candidate that 
the insurance companies fear the most. 
</P>
<P>
Collis' ad will start airing today in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. The buy in 
the first week is $35,000, according to the Collis campaign, but may be 
supplemented later. The Press ads begin Saturday in Los Angeles and the Bay 
Area. The buy for 10 days, according to that campaign, is $150,000 and may be 
supplemented and extended to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the ads, with an analysis by Times staff writer Kenneth Reich: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: The Collis ad features Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield, who is 
backing Collis. Rosenfield declares: "There's only one thing the insurance 
companies fear as much as Proposition 103. An insurance commissioner who'll 
make them obey it. Conway Collis is the candidate they're most afraid of, 
because Conway Collis is the only one willing to jail 'em. Kick 'em out of the 
state. Even create nonprofit auto insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Collis has, in campaign statements, advocated jailing insurance 
company executives who fail to comply with the state's insurance law and has 
supported a proposed initiative that would kick the companies out of the state 
and create a state-run auto insurance company unless the companies implement 
Proposition 103. The initiative, however, has been put off to 1992 at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the companies are "most afraid of" Collis is a subjective argument. 
Many insurers have expressed opposition to and concern about Collis, but no one 
has publicly said he or she is "afraid" of him. 
</P>
<P>
Ads: Two of the three brief Press ads portray Press as "an insurance 
commissioner the insurance companies will fear the most," and the other says he 
is "the man the insurance companies will fear the most." One says he is the 
only candidate for commissioner endorsed by the Democratic Party; a second 
says: "He fought the developers to protect California's coastline," and a third 
says: "He fought big oil to stop offshore drilling." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: It is true that Press is the only candidate officially endorsed by 
the California Democratic Party. And as director of the state Office of 
Planning and Research in the Administration of Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., Press 
was active in the fight against offshore oil drilling, and he was press 
secretary of the initiative campaign that established the California Coastal 
Commission in order to rein in coastal development. 
</P>
<P>
It's an open question as to who the insurance companies fear the most. Many 
insurers discussing the Press campaign have expressed the view that he is the 
candidate of the California Trial Lawyers Assn., although it has not formally 
endorsed him. The insurers regard the trial lawyers as their principal rivals 
on insurance issues. Many insurers have accordingly expressed concern about 
Press, but no one has publicly said he or she is afraid of him. Although he has 
taken trial lawyer contributions, Press recently said that to secure lower 
insurance rates, he would fight the trial 
</P>
<P>
lawyers, too.

A Denver man who was beset by burglaries and rigged a shotgun booby trap that 
killed an intruder in his warehouse will get a deferred sentence for reckless 
manslaughter under a plea bargain, Dist. Atty. Norm Early said. If a judge 
approves the deal, Philip Connaghan, 46, will spend no time in jail and his 
record will be cleared if he has no further run-ins with the law, Early said.

REDOUBT VOLCANO UNLEASHES ROCKSLIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
Part of the summit lava dome on Redoubt Volcano collapsed, sending up a plume 
of ash and unleashing a rockslide down a flank of the mountain near two 
scientists, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said. There was no telltale seismic 
increase before the lava dome collapsed and the mountain ejected a plume of ash 
and steam that reached 31,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Small, shallow earthquakes, which have been occurring at Redoubt since it came 
to life Dec. 14, 1989, usually increase in magnitude and frequency before an 
eruption as a warning signal. The 10,197-foot mountain 110 miles southwest of 
Anchorage sent the rockslide roaring down from the summit crater on the north 
flank of the mountain to about 1,000 feet short of where the U.S. Geological 
Survey scientists were working. They were unharmed, officials said. Redoubt has 
been erupting roughly once a week for several months.

A 5-year-old boy steered a runaway car to safety on a freeway after his mother 
apparently passed out at the wheel, the California Highway Patrol said. "My 
mommy's dead! My mommy's dead!" the boy screamed after the car was brought to a 
halt by an off-duty Alameda County firefighter who drove his pickup truck in 
front of the car to slow it. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Brian Bailey said he checked the woman's pulse and breathing and 
reassured the boy that his mother was alive. The boy said his mother had been 
drinking, Bailey said. He said the car was going about 25 m.p.h. down a slight 
grade when he brought it to a stop near a freeway exit. The impact crunched the 
back of his pickup. CHP Officer Casey Simpson said Kathy Graves, 31, of Castro 
Valley, was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. Her son, Anthony, was 
placed in temporary foster care.

DISNEY TAKES ON TRADITION WITH 'TRACY'; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE UPCOMING MOVIE, WHICH FEATURES SOME VIOLENCE AND OVERT 
SEXUALITY, IS MEANT TO SHOW THAT THE STUDIO FEELS THE TIME IS RIGHT TO BROADEN 
ITS APPEAL.

<P>
When Dick Tracy shoots his way into movie theatres this summer, his won't be 
the only famous name at stake. Walt Disney Co., in a bold departure, is 
releasing the film under the classic "Disney" banner usually reserved for such 
kiddie fare as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
Loaded with double entendres and featuring Madonna in outfits provocative 
enough to send Bashful into cardiac arrest, "Dick Tracy" drastically stretches 
the boundaries of the Walt Disney Pictures formula. The company has been so 
protective of the Disney name and the family values it represents that in the 
past all but the tamest films were released through its companion Touchstone 
division. Even "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" was deemed too racy for the Disney 
name. 
</P>
<P>
With "Tracy," Disney executives are sending a message that those days are over. 
Insiders say the company, flush with success, is no longer afraid to tamper 
with its traditions. "The Disney name is still sacred, but you can do other 
things with it now," said one. 
</P>
<P>
David Hoberman, head of the Disney and Touchstone film units, said more mature 
films will be added to the traditional Walt Disney Pictures mix of reissued 
classics and animated features as the studio steps up production in the coming 
year. The move comes as the company is also launching a third division called 
Hollywood Pictures under Ricardo Mestres. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I have been asked to do is bring back Disney live-action 
movies," said Hoberman, who has headed the two film units for six months. "We 
spent four years making Touchstone into a major motion picture company, 
probably at the expense of Disney." 
</P>
<P>
When all three production units are cranking at full speed in 1991, the studio 
hopes to release about 25 to 30 pictures a year. That would place Disney closer 
to the front of the pack among major studios, which annually release anywhere 
from 14 to 40 films. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts say more films will be a plus for the studio unless quality 
suffers. "They are going to have increased output, but the bottom line is, 'How 
good is the project?' " said Mara M. Balsbaugh of Smith Barney, Harris Upham 
&amp; Co. "In the past, they've demonstrated an above-average ability to make 
commercially successful movies on average-level budgets." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Disney reported record revenue and income for the second quarter 
of fiscal 1990. Revenue from filmed entertainment rose 30%, to $469 million, 
from the year before. Overall revenue increased 26%, to $1.3 billion, and net 
income rose 20% to $178.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite persistent rumors of bad blood between Hoberman and Mestres -- one 
producer said the two executives are "only as competitive as Fox and Warner 
Bros." -- some filmmakers are happy to see the increased production, saying 
more projects benefit the entire community. They also said Disney has thus far 
avoided the trap of bidding against itself for a project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just another place to sell something," said one producer. "A lot of 
people will go to David or Ricardo first, depending on their relationship with 
one or the other. The idea is to provide incentive and competition, and both 
guys were developing their own stuff anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the filmed entertainment division at Disney coincided with 
the production and release of the studio's first trio of flops in recent 
memory. But the embarrassment caused by the anemic "Blaze," "Stella" and "Where 
the Heart Is" has apparently been relieved by the success of its more recent 
entries, "Pretty Woman" and "Ernest Goes to Jail." Both have been in the top 10 
for several weeks, with "Pretty Woman" grossing $71.6 million and "Ernest Goes 
to Jail" pulling in $17.2 million through last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations are also high for the studio's upcoming films. They include 
director Paul Mazursky's "Scenes from a Mall" with Woody Allen and Bette 
Midler, and the sequel to the runaway hit "Three Men and a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
Other films scheduled to go into production are "The Marrying Man," a comedy 
with Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin; the American remake of "Mama, There's a Man 
in Your Bed"; "Gone Fishing," a Steven Spielberg project, and "One Good Cop," a 
drama starring Michael Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
But as the busy summer movie season approaches, it's Warren Beatty's "Tracy," a 
live-action feature based on the cartoon detective, that's attracting the most 
attention. Shot in bold primary colors, featuring a constellation of major 
stars such as Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino in supporting roles and costing 
upward of $30 million, Disney hopes "Tracy" will generate the same kind of box 
office and merchandising mania as last year's "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have seen "Tracy" defend its violence as cartoonish. But there's no 
denying the overt sexuality of Madonna's Breathless Mahoney in her 
dressed-to-thrill costumes. Like "Batman," "Tracy" also has dark shadings that 
may broaden its appeal beyond the kids' market. 
</P>
<P>
The film is expected to receive a PG-13 rating, meaning parental guidance is 
advised for children under that age. Hoberman said the Walt Disney Pictures 
banner will never fly over an R-rated film. Whether "Tracy" soils Disney's 
reputation remains to be seen, but one Hollywood executive questioned the 
wisdom of taking that risk. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to signal to the world that they are doing family entertainment, 
they run the risk of losing that particular association," he said. "They can no 
longer say that if the film is from Walt Disney Pictures, you can automatically 
take your family." 
</P>
<P>
Hoberman, however, held that "Tracy" will only enhance the Disney name. "I'm 
not sure any particular thought went into this other than the fact that it just 
felt right," Hoberman said. "It's bigger than life, and we think it fits in 
well with the Disney tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Several people familiar with Disney agreed that the company probably has little 
to lose, the reasoning being that the dark days of the early 1980s, when the 
Disney label was box office death among adults, are long past, and that the 
time is right for broadening its appeal. 
</P>

CABINET COUNCIL URGES PRESIDENT NOT TO CITE JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: TO HEAD OFF CRITICISM IN CONGRESS, THE PANEL ALSO RECOMMENDS TAKING 
ACTION AGAINST INDIA FOR ALLEGED UNFAIR PRACTICES. 
</P>

<P>
President Bush's Cabinet-level Economic Policy Council recommended Thursday 
that the Administration not cite Japan for alleged unfair trade practices this 
year, even though following the recommendation appears certain to spark a 
backlash in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous decision is to be announced formally today. Bush, who was not at 
the meeting, is expected to approve the Cabinet recommendation intact, key 
Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to head off possible criticism that he is flouting the 1988 Trade 
Act, the council also suggested that Bush re-target India for talks. The 
Administration launched trade proceedings against India -- along with Japan and 
Brazil -- a year ago. Tokyo and Brasilia eventually made concessions, but New 
Delhi refused to negotiate at all. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1988 law, the White House is required each spring to cite specific 
foreign trade practices that it wants to eliminate and then seek formal 
negotiations with the countries involved. The measure authorizes the President 
to impose sanctions if the talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet council's move, which marks a softening of the tougher stance on 
trade that the Administration took a year ago, reflects a belief by Bush and 
his top policy-makers that Japan has made enough major concessions in recent 
trade negotiations to deserve some reward. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it was not clear Thursday whether Bush would agree to target even 
India when he makes his final decision today. 
</P>
<P>
Some Bush strategists fear that if the White House were to cite New Delhi, the 
action could jeopardize support for the Uruguay Round, the global trade talks 
under way in Geneva. Several have urged a so-called zero-option approach of 
citing no countries this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet council also urged the President to issue a warning that he would 
reconsider the Administration's position if Japan does not follow through on 
the concessions it has promised, or if the broader trade talks in Geneva go 
sour later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The move is a gamble. Many Bush strategists believe that with trade pressures 
easing, any grumbling from Congress is likely to be short-lived. Instead, they 
say the real backlash may come next year, when the Administration seeks 
approval of any new Uruguay Round accord. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it is clear that Congress -- whose members already have begun 
criticizing Bush for refusing to use the unfair-trade-practices provision of 
the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act -- will not let the Administration off lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the President's decision, House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) joined 69 other House members in urging the Administration to 
cite Japan again this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration "wants to give up" in the trade fight, Gephardt said at a 
news conference on the Capitol grounds, "but we say America can do better." He 
warned that letting Tokyo off the hook so early would be "a serious mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Senate Finance Committee have warned that failure to use the 
1988 law could spark a crisis between Congress and the Administration and might 
endanger congressional approval of any Uruguay Round accord or other trade 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Administration officials said Bush apparently was determined to 
avoid leveling any new charges -- particularly against Japan, where Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu has spent a lot of political capital pushing through 
trade concessions for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The list of trade concessions that Japan has made over the past several weeks 
is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
In an interim report on yearlong economic talks known as the Structural 
Impediments Initiative, Japan pledged to make sweeping reforms on a number of 
major issues in an effort to open Japanese markets to more foreign goods and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The list includes first steps toward overhauling the country's archaic product 
distribution system, cracking down on monopoly practices by Japanese business, 
increasing spending for public works and reforming the country's outmoded 
pricing practices. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after stalling for months, Tokyo moved to settle U.S. complaints 
involving communications satellites, super-computers and forest products. It 
eliminated roadblocks to protecting sound recordings. And it agreed to put 
negotiations on telecommunications equipment on a fast track. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also moved to settle a number of other U.S. complaints involving 
everything from legal services and food additives to steel and pharmaceuticals. 
It also agreed to help support the Treasury's year-old Third World debt plan. 
</P>
<P>
The series of concessions from Japan followed a meeting between Bush and Kaifu 
early in March in which the President warned that domestic pressures on the 
trade issue were intensifying and that the Administration may not be able to 
control them. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, domestic pressures in Japan have been changing, amid 
increasing popular support for overhauling Japan's economy to allow more 
competition and imports of foreign products and businesses.

MOSCOW BUSES WILL SPORT ADS MADE IN U.S.A.

Madison Avenue jumped on the glasnost bus in more ways then one Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An American firm that sells advertising space on buses from Los Angeles to New 
York signed a multimillion-dollar licensing agreement to sell ads on every 
public bus in Moscow -- and a dozen other Soviet cities. 
</P>
<P>
By July, Transportation Displays Inc., a New York-based firm that claims to 
sell more bus ads than any company in America, expects to place ads on the 
sides of more than 14,000 buses in Moscow alone, for such companies as 
Pepsi-Cola and McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been advertising on buses in the Soviet Union before, this 
is the first organized effort to license the sale of the ad space. Weary Soviet 
commuters may soon have to get used to seeing such omnipresent ad slogans as 
"You deserve a break today." 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of opportunity only comes around once," said Bill Apfelbaum, 
president and chief executive of Transportation Displays. "Russia is one of the 
few countries that, until now, has hardly allowed any kind of advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Because the agreement was just reached with the Soviet government this week, 
the firm has yet to sign on any advertisers. But it expects to reach agreements 
with several major American packaged goods makers, soft-drink companies, 
fast-food outlets and even some airlines. The company is also negotiating with 
advertisers from Europe and the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
The move is regarded by advertising executives as an early attempt to cash in 
on the new marketing opportunities in the Soviet Union that go hand in hand 
with perestroika. And many more advertising entrepreneurs are expected to 
follow suit. Earlier this month, Izvestia, one of the Soviet Union's largest 
newspapers, placed ads in Forbes and Business Week that invited American 
companies to advertise in their paper. 
</P>
<P>
Not all American advertisers are jumping on the bandwagon. Warner Bros., for 
example, recently signed a joint agreement to build movie theaters in Moscow. 
But a Warner Bros. executive gave little indication on Monday that the company 
would be very interested in advertising on the sides of Moscow buses. "Who 
knows?" said John Jacobs, vice president of media at Warner Bros. "When 
American marketers look to Russia, some are already finding out there's not as 
much discretionary income as they thought." 
</P>
<P>
But at least one American advertising executive said Transportation Displays 
will probably be successful. "Any form of commercial communication in Russia 
will be new, therefore it will be news," said Gerrold R. Rubin, president of 
the Los Angeles agency Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates. "Besides, this seems to 
be one that will be very accessible." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, because there is little private transportation in the Soviet Union, the 
majority travel by bus. Consider, while Los Angeles has about 2,000 public 
buses and New York has about 4,000, Moscow has more than 14,000. The bus ads 
are expected to be seen by up to 300 million people throughout the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
But they will not come cheaply. The bus ads, which will be about 12 feet long 
and 2 feet high, will cost about $500 each, said Apfelbaum. It would cost about 
$200,000 to appear on 400 buses -- which Apfelbaum suggests is a minimum for 
much market penetration. Although cigarette advertising will be permitted, no 
ads for alcoholic beverages are allowed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Will his company blight the landscape in Moscow? "It's not blight, it's a way 
to brighten the dreary environment," said Apfelbaum. "Besides, Moscow will 
never look like La Cienega Boulevard."

BIG COLUMBIA S&amp;L REAL ESTATE DEALS TURN SOUR; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE ORANGE COUNTY OFFICE TOWERS BUILT WITH KOLL CO. IN '88 ARE STILL 
HALF EMPTY. THE S&amp;L NEEDS TO SELL ITS INTEREST TO RAISE CAPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When one of the nation's largest and most profitable thrifts teamed up with the 
biggest developer on the West Coast to construct office buildings in the early 
1980s, it probably seemed like a very good idea indeed. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the two companies had a lot more in common than fashionable 
addresses. Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., based in Beverly Hills, had lots 
of money to invest. And the Koll Co. of Newport Beach had years of experience 
building offices, factories and warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before the junk bond market crashed in 1989, forcing Columbia to 
report huge losses. It was also before the office market started going downhill 
in Orange County, which also began in earnest last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now Columbia has told the Securities and Exchange Commission that the office 
towers it built in 1988 with Koll in Irvine and Orange are still half empty. 
The thrift has been forced to sink more cash into them to keep them operating 
and now needs to sell its interest in the buildings to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. The remaining land that Koll and Columbia own in Irvine may 
not be worth nearly as much as the two had thought, since the city may not 
allow them to construct as many buildings as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Columbia told the SEC it has put aside $49 million to cover 
potential losses on its real estate investments. Sources said as much as $30 
million of that amount has been set aside for the Koll buildings, some of it to 
cover continuing operating expenses but most of it in anticipation of losses 
when the thrift sells its interest in the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Koll Co. did not respond to requests for comment, so it is 
impossible to determine Koll's percentage of the partnership with Columbia or 
its potential losses on the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Columbia's recent filings with the SEC provide an interesting glimpse at 
how the market downturn has affected the intensely private Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia told the SEC that its two 12-story office towers at Koll Center Irvine 
North near John Wayne Airport -- which opened in 1988 -- were only 56% leased 
by the end of last year. (Until recently, developers expected to fill new 
office buildings within a year.) The problem was even worse at Koll Center 
Orange, where an office tower constructed in 1988 was only 47% occupied. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County alone, a fifth of the nearly 50 million square feet of space 
in larger, newer office buildings is empty, commercial broker Coldwell Banker 
reported recently. Even though tenants took nearly 1 million square feet of 
office space off the market during the first quarter of the year -- a very 
healthy amount -- there's still lots more space out there, and rents remain 
flat. And while construction has slowed, there's still plenty more office space 
coming out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
According to the SEC filing, the city of Irvine is pondering how much more 
development to allow around John Wayne Airport, including the remaining land at 
Koll Center Irvine North owned by Columbia and Koll. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city makes up its mind whether to allow Koll to build three more 
office towers and other buildings on the land, "the liquidity and marketability 
of this investment will be substantially impaired," Columbia told the SEC. And 
if the city imposes new conditions or restrictions on the project, "the market 
value of this investment is likely to decline substantially." 
</P>
<P>
Those buildings and the land make up about a third of Columbia's real estate 
portfolio, for an investment of about $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
Just how serious is all this? The $62 million Columbia lost last year on its 
real estate investments is dwarfed by the more than $500 million it lost in the 
last five months. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate, in fact, wasn't the cause of Columbia's problems, as it was for a 
lot of thrifts. What hurt Columbia was its $3.5-billion junk bond portfolio, 
which plummeted in value when the market for the risky high-yield bonds dropped 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The losses wiped out its capital; the thrift acknowledged in another SEC filing 
Thursday that it might be seized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
But what to do with the real estate remains a persistent problem: Columbia is 
under pressure from new federal thrift regulations to sell its real estate by 
1994. If the market doesn't improve soon, it will be hard for the thrift to get 
top dollar. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Columbia told the SEC, there is no assurance "the association will 
recover its investments with respect to any of these projects." 
</P>
<P>
For Koll the problems aren't as serious. The giant developer has amassed 
billions of dollars in real estate holdings and isn't likely to be affected 
much by taking on a new partner when Columbia sells its interest in Koll Center 
Irvine North and Koll Center Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Koll has already had several other partners bail out of the high vacancy rates 
and low rents of the Orange County market by selling their interests in 
buildings. In fact, the big developer is rumored to have a partner already 
lined up for the Columbia buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Koll still faces an office market that is overbuilt; even while the stream of 
tenants looking for office space remains steady, there is still way too much 
space to fill. 
</P>
<P>
And with the thrifts out of the action thanks to the new federal regulations, 
experts say it's getting harder to find financing for real estate deals, even 
for big players such as Koll. 
</P>
<P>
One of Koll's biggest deals, in fact, recently fell through when Union Pacific 
Corp. said the developer did not come up with adequate financing to complete 
the $532-million acquisition of the railroad's massive landholdings.

Robert Campeau to Pay Bank: Financier Robert Campeau, struggling under a 
mountain of personal debt, has agreed to pay the National Bank of Canada $34 
million U.S. by May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said it was unclear how Campeau, who appears to be close to 
personal bankruptcy, will raise the money. Campeau, whose personal finances are 
as tangled as the company he chairs, could not be reached for comment. A 
spokesman for Campeau Corp. said the deal between Robert Campeau and the bank 
is a personal one and will not affect the company.

SALE OF EASTERN'S ROUTES TO AMERICAN APPROVED

<P>
The government on Thursday approved the sale of most Eastern Airlines foreign 
routes to American Airlines and awarded a new Texas-Tokyo route to Continental 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has the authority to reject either deal if he believes that it 
will harm U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department's decision, made tentatively 10 days ago, 
includes the transfer to American of Eastern's Central and South American 
routes as well as its Miami-Madrid flights and a Miami-London route operated by 
Continental, Eastern's sister carrier in the Texas Air group. 
</P>
<P>
The department refused to allow the transfer of Eastern's Florida-Toronto route 
as part of the deal, saying it would examine the proposal further and consider 
selecting a carrier other than American to operate the service. Three other 
carriers have indicated an interest, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A bankruptcy judge last week turned Eastern over to a trustee, removing it from 
the control of Texas Air Corp. owner Frank Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's previous management had said sale of the routes to American, approved 
by the bankruptcy court, was key to Eastern's financial plans. American had 
agreed to pay $349 million, but that sum included the Toronto route. 
</P>
<P>
The awarding of a Houston-Honolulu-Tokyo route to Continental ended competition 
among six carriers for a service formerly belonging to Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo service, lost by Federal Express when it took over Flying Tiger Line, 
which already had U.S.-Japan cargo authority, has been expanded to include both 
passenger and cargo service. 
</P>
<P>
Continental and three other carriers -- America West, Aloha and Delta -- 
proposed a Honolulu-Tokyo route to replace the Federal Express service. 
Hawaiian Airlines wanted to run the service between Honolulu and Nagoya and 
American proposed a service between San Jose and Tokyo.

Alot of smart people on Wall Street always said that high-yield junk bonds were 
really more like stocks than bonds. Now, a growing number of junk bond mutual 
funds are getting ready to call a spade a spade: They're ramping up to take 
what could be significant equity stakes in troubled companies. 
</P>
<P>
If you own shares in a junk bond fund, the potential change in investment 
approach is of more than passing interest. It may mean you'll no longer own a 
pure bond fund. Part of your money will be betting on the long-term 
appreciation of shares in ailing firms rather than producing income. 
</P>
<P>
For most funds that end up with equity stakes, it will happen this way: 
Troubled companies that have issued junk bonds will ask bondholders to 
transform the debt into equity. The companies' goal will be to buy the time 
necessary to work out their problems. Basically, the bondholders will be asked 
to give up the interest income they were promised in exchange for stock that 
could appreciate sharply -- if the companies succeed in restructuring 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Such debt-for-equity swaps may offer the only way out of the soup for many 
deeply indebted companies that can no longer afford to pay 13%-plus junk 
yields. The swap idea isn't novel, but it is taking on new importance as bond 
defaults soar. 
</P>
<P>
Few junk funds now have large equity stakes, but fund managers clearly are 
getting ready for the inevitable. For example, Los Angeles-based Pacific 
Horizon High Yield fund is planning to notify shareholders of a change in the 
wording of the fund's bylaws. Now, the fund can hold up to 10% of its assets in 
stock. But such shares can be received only as part of bond offerings (some 
bonds are sold with stock as a sweetener). 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nugent, manager of the Pacific fund, wants to change the bylaw wording so 
that he can accept stock in exchange for bonds already in the portfolio. "Given 
market conditions, bond managers have to take another look" at their options, 
Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
Limits vary on what funds can eventually own in stock. Fidelity High Income 
fund, a $1.1-billion junk fund, can have up to 20% of its assets in stock, said 
spokesman Neil Litvack. The Mid-America High Yield fund in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 
can have up to 49% of assets in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Wiskemann, manager of the Franklin AGE High Income fund in San Mateo, is 
ecstatic about the chance to change some troubled bonds into stock. "We would 
love it," said Wiskemann, whose fund has no limitations on equity holdings. 
"We'd love to have 5% or so in equity. And if it grows into a large amount, 
that would be great." 
</P>
<P>
Wiskemann and other fund managers are betting that equity stakes will pay off 
in a big way over the long term. Typically, when a money manager agrees to help 
an ailing firm, the price is steep: The investor often wants the refinancing 
structured so that its equity stake will return 30% or more, annualized, 
assuming the firm recovers. 
</P>
<P>
The catch is that those returns aren't realized for many years -- when the 
equity can be sold to someone else or back to the company. And if the firm 
doesn't make it, the equity can vanish. 
</P>
<P>
Some junk fund managers aren't comfortable with the idea of owning a lot of 
stock. David Halfpap, who runs the Mid-America fund, said he would "rather not 
have any equity. . . . People bought this as a high-yield fund." Even fund 
managers such as Wiskemann, who welcomes equity, say their funds will remain 
primarily income investments. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line for junk fund shareholders: Be sure you know your fund's plans 
for equity investments. In many cases, a fund may not have much choice but to 
accept stock for bonds, because many sickly junk bonds simply aren't salable 
these days. Even so, you have a right to know what kind of equity you may end 
up owning, and how much. 
</P>
<P>
Junk Warning No. 2: If you haven't sold your junk bond fund shares by now -- 
after all the market has been through since last fall -- it's probably because 
you figure the worst is over. 
</P>
<P>
Don't bet your lunch money on that. 
</P>
<P>
The Ames Department Stores bankruptcy filing Thursday raised the total of rated 
corporate bonds in default to $9.3 billion year-to-date, says John Lonski, 
economist at Moody's Investors Service. So we've nearly surpassed the $9.4 
billion in rated bond defaults for all of 1989. And there still are eight 
months to go. (Rated bonds are those tracked by services such as Moody's. The 
figures don't even include the junkiest defaults, because those bonds don't get 
ratings.) 
</P>
<P>
Lonski figures there's a "very good chance we'll see $20 billion in defaults 
this year." And with every tick up in interest rates, which are rising again, 
default risk grows for more borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
There's another cloud over the junk heap too. The National Assn. of Insurance 
Commissioners, representing state insurance regulators, is in the process of 
writing tighter restrictions on junk bond ownership by insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
The NAIC's working group on new regulations will meet May 10 in Washington to 
look over the proposals. The biggest change would be to force some insurers to 
set more money aside in reserve to offset the risk of certain junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Some junk market analysts fear that by raising reserve rules, the regulators 
would make junk bonds even less palatable to insurers -- potentially sparking a 
new round of bond dumping. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Lennon, chief examiner of the New York State Insurance Department and 
chairman of the NAIC working group, scoffs at the notion that higher reserves 
would prompt insurers to sell their bonds. "Who are they going to sell them 
to?" he asks, noting the illiquid state of the junk market. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they don't have anyone to sell to is part of the reason for 
this," he said, referring to the proposals. But he also said the NAIC is 
willing to work with insurers to make sure the final rules don't cause major 
damage. "We're not interested in turning the industry on its ear," he said. 
</P>

Big on SmallCap: Capital Research &amp; Management, the Los Angeles-based money 
management titan (assets: $40 billion), has scored big with its new SmallCap 
World Fund. The fund, which will invest in small-company stocks worldwide, has 
attracted $673 million in investors' money through Thursday. That makes it the 
second-biggest launch ever for an open-ended stock mutual fund. Only the 
Gabelli Value Fund drew more ($1.1 billion in its launch last year). The 
SmallCap fund now is closed to new investors, and won't sell new shares again 
before Jan. 1.

Briefly: Allergan, the Irvine-based eye-care products company spun off from 
SmithKline Beckman last July, continues to attract new fans. Prudential-Bache 
Securities recently issued a "buy" signal on the stock, as did the Street Smart 
Investing newsletter in Brewster, N.Y. Allergan's earnings have been weak of 
late because of soft sales in some markets, but Pru-Bache says the stock is 
cheap, based on estimated 1991 earnings per share of $1.60. Allergan rose 87.5 
cents to $16.125 Thursday. . . .

<P>
Xerox Corp., a recent subject in this column, Thursday reported disappointing 
first-quarter earnings. While operating earnings in the company's copier 
business rose 20% -- a healthy showing -- Xerox's insurance arm performed 
miserably. Overall, operating earnings per share fell 28% from a year ago, to 
$1.06. The stock fell $1.25 to $51, showing that more Xerox shareholders see 
little hope of a turnaround soon. . . .

<P>
THE JUNK EXPLOSION 
</P>
<P>
The volume of so-called distressed securities outstanding -- including junk 
bonds -- is mushrooming. And so is investor interest in those securities. 
Here's a snapshot, using estimates by Edward Altman, a New York University 
professor who has spent years researching the subject: 
</P>
<P>
* The face value of distressed corporate debt securities -- including bonds, 
troubled bank loans and trade claims -- was about $300 billion at Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
* Publicly held corporate debt securities that are yielding more than 18% total 
$75 billion. A lot of those bonds aren't in default but are distressed enough 
that the companies that issued them may ultimately be forced to exchange them 
for new securities. 
</P>
<P>
* There is at least $5 billion under active management by investment firms 
hunting for opportunities in distressed securities. Those investors expect a 
very good return for the risk they are taking. A survey of 56 big investors in 
distressed securities showed that one-third of the investors expect a 30% 
annual return. About two-thirds expect a minimum return of 20% to 25%.

OFF-PRICE SAFEWAY SHARES FIND BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: ANALYSTS SAID THE 10 MILLION SHARES WERE PRICED WELL BELOW WHAT HAD 
BEEN ANTICIPATED.

Safeway Inc. found a ready market Thursday for the 10 million shares that it 
sold at a discount in its first public offering since its leveraged buyout by 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The shares, representing 10% of the company, were priced at $11.25, sharply 
below the selling range of $13 to $16 anticipated when Safeway announced the 
offering two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 million shares were placed with institutional subscribers to the 
offering at $11.25. The first trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday 
morning was at $11.625. By the 4 p.m. close in New York, the per-share price 
had risen to $12.375, with more than 2.1 million shares trading hands. 
</P>
<P>
Safeway, a 1,117-store supermarket chain based in Oakland, was converted to 
private ownership by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in 1986. KKR made an 
investment of only $175 million but heaped $5.8 billion worth of debt onto the 
retailer in a so-called leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Safeway has sold off inefficient operations, reduced its debt to 
$3.1 billion and steadily improved its operating performance. Operating profit 
as a percentage of sales rose to 3.2% in 1989 from 2.3% in 1986. Sales last 
year were $14.3 billion. However, the company still has a negative net worth as 
a result of the debt load. 
</P>
<P>
The past few weeks have been tense for Safeway officials and underwriters 
attempting to drum up interest in the offering. They encountered resistance 
from institutional investors disenchanted with KKR and leery of companies 
overloaded with debt. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the lead underwriter, was forced to slash the price 
late Wednesday to $11.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced price made the offering more palatable, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"What it reflects (is that) it's not adequate in today's market to provide the 
stub of an LBO and expect investors to value it at a premium in anticipation of 
de-leveraging the balance sheet and (having good) earnings four years down the 
road," said John B. Kosecoff, an analyst with the First Manhattan Co. 
investment firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative would have been to not make the offering at all," Kosecoff 
said. Reducing the price was viewed as preferable. 
</P>
<P>
The brisk trading "sure shows that there's a large buying interest from 
someone," said Suzanne McGrath, an analyst with Black &amp; Co., an investment 
firm in Portland, Ore. The offering came in a little low, she said, "but not 
massively so." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she added, "We think it's worth quite a bit more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Safeway said in its prospectus for the offering that it plans to use the 
proceeds to make capital improvements, such as remodeling or opening new 
stores. However, the money raised in the offering is only a fraction of the 
$3.2 billion the company has said it plans to spend on capital improvements 
through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
A successful offering was seen as crucial to help mend the tattered reputation 
of KKR, which has been damaged of late by declines in the market for 
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, used in many of its buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Neither KKR nor Safeway executives, who bought shares initially for $2 each, 
are selling stock in this offering, but they will be free to sell shares on the 
open market in 180 days.

SMALL BUSINESS: SELLING AND STAYING ISN'T EASY 
</P>

For weeks after Ellen Henderson Boughn sold her After Image stock photo agency, 
she could hardly sharpen a pencil without sending a fax to notify the corporate 
office in London. 
</P>
<P>
Boughn sold the business and continued working there but was unsure how to 
behave until she realized that she had to stop thinking like an entrepreneur. 
Instead, she had to become a member of a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether I am personally comfortable about taking a risk doesn't apply 
anymore," said Boughn. "What matters in making a decision is whether this a 
reasonable business risk, and can I defend it?" 
</P>
<P>
Letting go of a business you have nurtured for years is traumatic for any 
small-business owner. But selling out and staying on in a management role poses 
additional challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Boughn sold to a larger, international stock photo agency because she needed an 
infusion of capital in order to expand. Although she was still in charge, she 
said her employees weren't sure how to deal with her anymore. It was also 
unsettling when salespeople who once courted her now bypassed Boughn to meet 
with representatives of the new owner. 
</P>
<P>
After a few rough weeks, Boughn said, she finally felt comfortable running -- 
but no longer owning -- the business she started on her kitchen table in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a scathing, honest conversation with yourself before making a 
decision like this," said Boughn. "You have to know yourself, what you need and 
what you are willing to give up." 
</P>
<P>
What Boughn gave up was control over a business that she started after seeing a 
need. While working as an editor tracking down pictures for a 20-volume set of 
Jacques Cousteau books, she was surprised to find that there was no stock photo 
agency on the West Coast. So, she began keeping track of local photographers' 
work on index cards stored in an old recipe box. In February, when she sold out 
to Tony Stone Worldwide, After Image had about 15 employees, 400,000 images on 
file and sales in excess of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs sell their companies for three major reasons, according to Frode 
Nordhoy, chairman and chief executive of Strategic Analysis Inc. in Reading, 
Pa. They are either bored with success and want to move on to new challenges, 
they want to reduce their personal financial exposure, or they need a capital 
infusion to dramatically expand the business. 
</P>
<P>
"But most entrepreneurs really don't know how to sell their businesses 
themselves," said Nordhoy. Because selling a small business is such an 
emotionally wrenching experience, he advises business owners to consider hiring 
outside professionals to advise them. 
</P>
<P>
Boughn asked her UCLA professor, Jose de la Torre, to represent her in the 
negotiations with Tony Stone Worldwide. De la Torre, who is director of the 
Center for International Business Education and Research, said he expects more 
small-business owners like Boughn to look overseas for suitors in light of the 
major economic changes taking place in Europe and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"The next generation of international expansion is coming from small- and 
medium-sized businesses who are linking up to share technology and offices," 
said De la Torre. 
</P>
<P>
Boughn's decision to sell was based in part on a marketing survey she 
commissioned from a group of UCLA graduate students studying management. The 
survey revealed that the stock photo industry was heading for a major shakeout 
because too many small companies were competing for business from the same 
advertising agencies, publishers and others. 
</P>
<P>
To survive and thrive, Boughn decided she needed capital. After scrutinizing 
her competitors, she approached Tony Stone Worldwide, which has 15 offices and 
annual sales between $10 million and $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
She knew the company was interested in the U.S. market because in 1988 Stone 
acquired Click/Chicago and changed the name to TSW/Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd always thought we'd like to go to the West Coast because it has the 
greatest sales potential," said Simon Thornley, president of TSW/Chicago. "We 
acquired After Image to get into the market and to work with Ellen." 
</P>
<P>
Thornley said despite Boughn's initial blizzard of unnecessary faxes, the 
transition has been surprisingly smooth. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing about this deal is we can probably learn a lot from Ellen," 
said Thornley. "And we feel our two business cultures work very well together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selling? Planning Makes a Big Difference 
</P>
<P>
If you are planning to sell your business in the next year or so, now is the 
time to sit down with your attorney and accountant to begin plotting strategy. 
Careful planning, especially tax planning, can make the deal much more 
attractive for both buyer and seller, according to Ron Weiner, a principal in 
Weiner Associates, a New York CPA firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Tax considerations can amount to one-third of the value of the deal in some 
cases," said Weiner, who specializes in counseling small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
The best time to complete the sale of your business is at the beginning of the 
year because the Internal Revenue Service requires you to pay any taxes due by 
April 15th of the following year. In many cases, this means if you sold your 
business on Jan. 1, 1990, you could have until April 15, 1991, to pay any tax 
due. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

session is sponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration, Pacific Bell 
Directory and the university. Registration is $20. For information call Marie 
Teeple at the SBA, (213) 894-4894. 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO SELL OUT, BUT STAY ON 
</P>
<P>
* Find out everything you can about the company you plan to sell your business 
to. Interview its employees, vendors, suppliers, analysts, competitors. 
</P>
<P>
* Hire the best professional advisers you can to plan and negotiate the deal. 
</P>
<P>
* Decide what you need to get out of the deal, besides money. 
</P>
<P>
* Once you've sold your business, don't expect things to remain the same. 
Realize that under its new owners your company's culture will be dramatically 
changed, no matter how similar your business goals are.

SOUTH KOREA'S STOCK MARKET HITS SKIDS

<P>
South Korea's stock market plunged Thursday in its biggest daily fall in 
history, sparking violent protests by investors against the government. 
</P>
<P>
Trusts joined panicking individuals in selling across the board, sending the 
composite stock index dropping by 28.96 points to close at 726.11. The previous 
record decline in a day was 27.53 points on April 12 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The market has now fallen about 22% this year on general pessimism over the 
country's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said furious investors held demonstrations at securities offices in 
Seoul's business district, Myongdong, and at the headquarters of securities 
companies in Yoido. 
</P>
<P>
A broker said one distraught investor at a demonstration at a Daishin 
Securities branch blamed President Roh Tae Woo for encouraging people to buy 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"She said now she has so many losses, it makes her sick to see Roh's face on 
television," the broker said. 
</P>
<P>
Yonhap news agency reported demonstrations at branch offices in Taegu and other 
provincial cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Roh regime, take responsibility for the stock market plunge and get out," 
chanted 200 investors in Puchon, south of Seoul. In Taegu protesters yelled: 
"Spineless Roh Tae Woo, get out." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said more than 300 riot police surrounded the Korea Stock Exchange in 
Yoido to head off protests. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investment trusts had to sell some of their holdings to raise 
cash to satisfy people who were asking for their money back. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a double whammy here," said Edward Kim at Daewoo Securities. 
"Investors are selling and trusts are selling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's overreaction, panic. You cannot logically explain the market's movement. 
It's illogical," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the threat of police action to break up a strike at Hyundai Heavy 
Industries huge shipyard in southeastern Ulsan also depressed sentiment. The 
government declared the strike illegal after an emergency Cabinet meeting on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The index started out 1990 on an upbeat note and marked a high on Jan. 4 at 
928.82.

U.S., JAPAN FIRMS TO DEVELOP GOLF PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A San Juan Capistrano developer and a Japanese construction company said 
Thursday that they have bought 430 acres in Camarillo, where they will sell 
land for houses around a lavish 18-hole golf course and country club. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Land &amp; Golf Inc. and Sato Kogyo America Corp. said the land 
purchase -- estimated to have cost about $45 million -- is thought to be one of 
the largest ever in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The partners will sell 186 sites of one to three acres for custom-built houses 
around the country club, called Spanish Hills Golf &amp; Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The partners say their market research shows strong demand for the golf course 
in Camarillo, which is midway between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean-view golf course will be designed by Robert Cupp, who was a course 
designer for 10 years with pro golfer Jack Nicklaus' company. This is 
Atlanta-based Cupp Design Inc.'s first golf course in California. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Pacific Land &amp; Golf developed the Marbella Golf and Country 
Club in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Sato Kogyo American is a U.S. subsidiary of Sato Kogyo Co., a large Tokyo 
engineering and construction company founded in 1862. It has been involved in 
the U.S. real estate market since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman Realty Corp. of Los Angeles was financial adviser to the partnership 
and arranged financing for the $150-million project. Cushman elected to stay on 
as a limited partner, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style country club will be designed by Robert Altevers Associates 
of Costa Mesa. The firm has designed many clubhouses, including the La Quinta 
Country Club near Palm Springs.

POSTMAN WHO SHOT DOG GETS 6-MONTH TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former postman was sentenced Thursday to six months in jail and three years 
probation for shooting a family dog to death while delivering mail the day 
after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor handed down the sentence 
despite a plea by Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, of Pacoima, not to be sent to 
jail but to perform community service instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I do care about animals," Sterling told the judge. "I do care about the little 
boy that was involved in the incident. I'm sorry about that. But doing jail 
time wouldn't do my family any good and it wouldn't bring back the dog." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling drew a .22-caliber revolver and fired one bullet into Skippy, a 
mixed-breed German shepherd, just as its owner, Tammie Brody, came out of her 
house on Bartee Avenue in Arleta to give the mailman a bottle of vodka for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Brody's son, Brian, 10, witnessed the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling told police after his arrest that Skippy had bitten him on several 
occasions and was menacing him on the day of the shooting. But Brody said 
Skippy was friendly to the postman. An investigation of the bullet's path 
showed the dog was facing away from Sterling when it was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, who was suspended without pay by the Postal Service, resigned March 
29 after being notified that the service was taking action to fire him, a 
spokesman said. Postal authorities picked up the $685 bill for Skippy's 
elaborate funeral at a Calabasas pet cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Brody did not attend Thursday's court hearing but said in a telephone interview 
that she had mixed feelings about the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to see anyone go to jail," she said. "I'm sorry this whole thing 
happened to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling was convicted Feb. 21 after pleading no contest to a charge of felony 
cruelty to an animal. Under an agreement between prosecutors and Sterling's 
lawyer, Sterling faced a maximum sentence of one year in jail and 36 months 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Judge Taylor said Sterling should spend time behind bars because 
the shooting endangered the neighborhood and because he had been convicted of 
two previous offenses that "involved a degree of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling was convicted in 1982 of misdemeanor spousal abuse and in 1988 of 
carrying a concealed revolver in his car. Also, Taylor said, Sterling was 
convicted in the mid-1980s of second-degree commercial burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"Noting that he has these convictions . . . I do believe that community service 
is not the best condition to impose, but that he should in fact spend time in 
custody," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Municipal Court judge Thursday declared that possession of the gun 
used to shoot the dog violated the terms of Sterling's probation on the earlier 
concealed-weapon conviction. Sterling will be sentenced to six months in jail 
for that violation, which he can serve concurrently with the sentence imposed 
Thursday, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the jail term and probation, Sterling was ordered to pay $500 to 
a restitution fund for crime victims and to undergo twice-monthly counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling's attorney, Salvatore P. Ciulla, told Taylor that Sterling should be 
spared incarceration because he has just found a new job and because his wife 
and four children depend on him.

BILL BOYARSKY: GATES HITS STRIDE WITH FOOT PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now's the time Police Chief Daryl F. Gates plays tough politics. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, money ran out to finance the police foot patrols that have 
been on the streets of crime-ridden neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley, 
Mid-Wilshire, South-Central Los Angeles and Venice since fall. Today, the Los 
Angeles City Council is scheduled to vote on whether to appropriate the 
$500,000 needed to revive the patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone likes them. No politician dares speak against something that has 
proved so popular with residents of besieged neighborhoods. But they can't 
agree on financing. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Zev Yaroslavsky of the Finance Committee thinks the money should come 
from funds the Police Department has set aside in a special overtime account 
for officers engaged in hot crime-fighting missions. The chief disagrees. He 
wants a special, additional appropriation from the council. The overtime 
account, he said, should be used for his top priority item -- making sure every 
patrol car in the city responds to a call within seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Going into this fight, it looks like Chief Gates is in trouble. Looking ahead 
to next year's budget, the city's facing a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But as I said, Chief Gates plays tough. Whenever the department has been in 
trouble financially with the council, it's been able to mobilize an important 
network in the city. Those are the Police Department's Neighborhood Watch 
groups, consisting of residents organized by police officers to support the 
department and help fight crime. We'll see if these residents can help him win 
in the council today. 
</P>
<P>
I got a feeling for neighborhood power on the last night of the patrol, when I 
rode around the Valley's Devonshire area with Sgt. George Thomas, who was in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is a friendly, talkative man, easy to be with even though he has that 
unnaturally formal manner adopted by cops when they're addressing people like 
me. For instance, he called crooks "the criminal element" rather than using the 
term police employ among themselves: "Scumbags." But he was fairly open, even 
slightly putting down some of the chief's favorite tactics -- the massive 
anti-drug sweeps and the "Hammer" assaults against gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reduced burglaries and robberies 38%," he said. "Nothing the department 
has done, the big Hammer task forces, the sweeps, nothing had reduced crime 38% 
and I've been here on the department for 17 years." 
</P>
<P>
We drove near the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area down Columbus and Orion 
avenues, where the six-officer patrols have chased out drug dealers. On Orion, 
visitors from another turf had left their graffiti calling cards, "Langdon 
Street" and "LST." These are working-class apartment neighborhoods, east and 
west of the San Diego Freeway. Most of the residents are Latino, with a 
minority of black families. On that warm evening, children played and parents 
visited in front of the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The cops, who work the patrols on their days off, walk down the streets, 
stopping to talk to residents, checking on abandoned cars, noting the graffiti. 
At times, they get the Neighborhood Watch together with the local Chamber of 
Commerce and hold street cleanup parties, removing the graffiti from trees and 
sidewalks. The police have old cars towed away, force property owners to clean 
up garbage-filled lots -- even give kids baseball cards, donated by the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
When neighbors complain about drug dealers, the cops walk up and knock on the 
person's door. "We've had a lot of complaints about you," they say. "We'll be 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
As Thomas talked, I could see the importance of the Neighborhood Watch, and the 
other residents, as supporters of the department. He told me about Officer John 
Girard, a foot patrol supervisor. After the foot patrols began, Girard revived 
the Neighborhood Watch in the Devonshire area, and 400 people showed up one 
night for a meeting at Our Lady of Peace Church. Afterward, they marched 
through the area in a demonstration against drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Four hundred people? No candidate for mayor's drawn 400 in years. 
</P>
<P>
These are just the sort of people that Chief Gates is counting on as he begins 
to play the annual budget game. If past patterns are followed, Neighborhood 
Watch people have been phoning council offices to support the department's 
position on the budget fight. And, there'll be department boosters on the 
council floor. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, it will be a short-term fix. The real question is whether 
there'll be money in the coming budget for the foot patrols in light of the 
expected deficit. That'll be decided in June when the council votes on the new 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
View this fight as round one, the year's first test of Daryl Gates' political 
clout.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-GUARD GETS 5 YEARS FOR 9 ROADSIDE 
ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former security guard has been sentenced to five years in state prison for 
posing as a police officer in order to rob, assault or attempt to sexually 
molest nine lone female motorists in a series of roadside attacks near the 
Pomona Freeway last summer. 
</P>
<P>
David Anthony McGregor, 19, of Whittier was charged with 24 counts in 
connection with the attacks, which occurred between Pico Rivera and Hacienda 
Heights during the first two weeks of July. 
</P>
<P>
The counts include assault with intent to commit rape, brandishing a knife, 
impersonating a police officer and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
McGregor, who pleaded no contest in January but has denied committing the 
crimes, was sentenced this week in Pomona by Superior Court Judge William 
McVittie.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING IS SCHEDULED ON INCORPORATION DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Thursday set a May 9 hearing to decide whether to prevent Los Angeles 
County supervisors from delaying Malibu's incorporation until next year -- 
assuming voters approve cityhood June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski agreed to hear the matter after lawyers for 
the county asked that Judge Dzintra Janavs be disqualified from the case. 
</P>
<P>
Under an order from Janavs, the supervisors last month approved going ahead 
with the election, but voted to delay the actual incorporation date until March 
28, 1991, if cityhood is approved. The delay is intended to allow the county 
time to start work on a sewer system it has long wanted to build in Malibu 
before a new local government has the chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers have asked the court to disallow the delay.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORMER POLICE CHIEF APPOINTED TO OLD POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Police Chief Robert Collins, 66, has been appointed to his old post in 
Monterey Park, replacing Kenneth Hickman, who resigned in March amid a 
controversy over control of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, a 34-year veteran of the force, was chief from 1987 to 1989, replacing 
another chief, Jon D. Elder, who had left as part of a local political 
firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really well respected in the community and within the police force," City 
Manager Mark Lewis said of Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman, a former Los Angeles police commander and one of the nation's few 
chiefs with a doctorate, had replaced Collins when Collins retired. Hickman 
resigned after the Monterey Park Police Officers Assn. voted no confidence in 
him.

STATE MONEY SOUGHT TO KEEP L.A. POLICE FOOT PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a popular Los Angeles police foot patrol program in peril due to 
unwillingness by police and elected city officials to pick up its $3-million 
price tag for another year, a legislator announced Thursday that he will 
attempt to raise the money in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) said at a City Hall news 
conference that he feels "encouraged" that his $8-million foot beat bill will 
win state approval. The legislation, which would also provide $2.5 million for 
foot patrols in crime-ridden areas of San Diego and San Jose, won support in 
the Assembly Committee on Public Safety this week, but has not yet picked up a 
sponsor in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The city's foot patrol program has been hailed by police officials as having 
reduced violent crime in many of 13 "hot spots" from South-Central Los Angeles 
to the San Fernando Valley, where officers have been deployed since the program 
began last September. 
</P>
<P>
"It has has had a tremendous effect on homicides, which is the ultimate crime 
as far as we're concerned," said Deputy Police Chief Jesse Brewer, who joined 
Friedman at the event. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer distributed charts Thursday showing that during the program's first 
three months, only three of 17 homicides in the targeted neighborhoods occurred 
while foot patrol officers were present. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the program's success, Los Angeles police officials have said that 
proposed city budget cuts for police overtime would make it impossible to fund 
the patrols for the new fiscal year beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The program is already out of money for this year, and the City Council today 
is expected to debate whether to appropriate $500,000 to keep the patrols going 
through the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, City Council members Zev Yaroslavsky and Richard 
Alatorre praised the patrols, the police and Friedman. They also indicated that 
the program is apparently dead if help does not arrive from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to continue the foot beat program in any meaningful way, it's going 
to take some assistance from outside the normal city budgetary process," 
Yaroslavsky said. "Everyone here knows that this city is facing a major 
financial crisis." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me it's worthwhile to continue it," added Alatorre. "It's 
unfortunate that it had to be cut out, but when you look at the fiscal picture 
for the city of Los Angeles, certainly other problems that the Police 
Department identified took a greater priority. There is nothing that is a 
greater priority than to cut down on the response time to crimes of violence 
and the like."

UNION TARGETS SWEATSHOP OPERATORS; 
</P>
<P>
GARMENT INDUSTRY: IT OPENS A DOWNTOWN DROP-IN CENTER TO ASSIST WORKERS -- EVEN 
NON-MEMBERS -- TO FILE GRIEVANCES AS PART OF LONG-RANGE RECRUITING EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having never been able to organize more than a few thousand of the estimated 
90,000 workers in Los Angeles' downtown garment district, the International 
Ladies Garment Workers Union on Thursday opened a downtown "drop-in" center 
that will assist workers -- regardless of whether they are members -- in filing 
unpaid-wage and overtime claims against sweatshop operators. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is part of an embryonic campaign to recruit immigrant workers that 
is taking place throughout organized labor, most noticeably in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
To recruit immigrants, labor is finding that it must break down widespread 
cynicism and fear by first offering a broad variety of social services to 
prospective members and then -- months or years later -- try to use that base 
to build organizing drives in plants. 
</P>
<P>
The new center, located in third-floor space rented by the union in a building 
at 110 E. 15th St., will be run by three union staff members who will counsel 
workers on a variety of social problems, said Steve Nutter, the union's 
regional director. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible mess out there," Nutter told a press conference inside the 
center, standing under a large banner proclaiming the center's theme, Consiendo 
con Dignidad -- sewing with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
In blessing the opening of the center, Father Luis Olivares, pastor of Our Lady 
Queen of Angels Roman Catholic Church, praised the role of unions and said they 
are always necessary, regardless of how benevolent an employer may claim to be. 
</P>
<P>
The union and state labor investigators contend that the $6-billion-a-year Los 
Angeles apparel industry requires workers -- some of them children -- to toil 
long hours in unsafe conditions for less than the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, such conditions make workers ripe for unionization. But 
hostility from employers, a high failure rate among businesses and the 
transient and vulnerable nature of many employees have undermined organizing 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
It was with these types of problems in mind that the AFL-CIO last year created 
the California Immigrant Worker Assn. to offer so-called "associate" union 
membership to immigrants, regardless of where they worked or whether their 
shops were actually organized. The association has signed up several thousand 
Los Angeles members in what it acknowledges is a glacially slow effort to set 
the stage for organizing drives at individual businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In setting up its garment district center, the Garment Workers Union became the 
first formal "division" of the Immigrant Worker Assn. Workers who drop by the 
center for advice will eventually be asked to become associate union members. 
</P>
<P>
The new center is part of what the union calls one of its most ambitious 
nationwide organizing drives in decades. Similar efforts are being made in 
Brooklyn, San Francisco, Chicago and El Paso, all with a call to "declare war 
on sweatshop conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The drive began last month on the 79th anniversary of the 1911 fire at the 
Triangle Shirtwaist Co. in Greenwich Village that killed 146 workers and is 
regarded as a historical spark in the movement for improved industrial safety. 
</P>
<P>
Besides trying to boost national membership of the union -- which has plummeted 
to 150,000 from 300,000 in the last 10 years -- the organizing drive will 
attempt to publicize proposals for tougher enforcement of sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
State legislation introduced by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) last 
month would make manufacturers jointly liable for any labor abuses committed by 
the hundreds of smaller businesses that sew their clothing. Among other things, 
it would protect workers against so-called "stich-and-ditch" sewing contractors 
who underpay their workers or go out of business without paying at all. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is expected to encounter strong opposition from manufacturers, 
who say they cannot police the labor practices of the independents who sew for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias Del Pueblo, a family-assistance group 
that has operated from a 7th Street storefront since 1987 to aid garment 
workers, said she welcomes the presence of the drop-in center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new turn on the union's part," she said. "In a sense it's stepping 
back, trying to do some groundwork that they have to do if they ever hope to 
gain the confidence of the workers. You have to work with garment workers on 
all of their problems -- eviction, child care -- not just work problems, 
because so many of them are living in poverty. We have some clients who work 55 
hours and get paid $50."

JANITORS THREATEN CENTURY CITY STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of 113 janitors employed by a major cleaning company at nine 
Century City office buildings said at a demonstration Thursday that they have 
authorized the Service Employees International Union to call a strike if the 
cleaning firm does not recognize the union as the bargaining agent for the 
janitors. 
</P>
<P>
The union's national "Justice for Janitors" campaign has won union recognition 
for janitors at a number of office buildings in downtown Los Angeles. But the 
union has yet to make any headway in its 7-month-old campaign to organize 
workers employed in Century City by non-union International Service System Inc.

HEARNS' BOUT GETS SILENT TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a fight Saturday night in Atlantic City, N.J., a title fight between 
Thomas (Hit Man) Hearns and Michael (Silk) Olajide, and it's being held at the 
Taj Mahal, Donald Trump's latest monument to greed and gaudiness, but damn few 
people besides The Hit Man, The Silk and The Donald know anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for that can be summed up in two words: Irving Rudd. Or, more 
accurately, the absence of same. On Monday, Bob Arum, the promoter of 
Hearns-Olajide, was asked about the lack of publicity for this fight, which 
should be garnering some attention, even if it is for Hearns' WBO 
super-middle-weight title. 
</P>
<P>
"Because . . . Irving's in the hospital," Arum thundered, with customary 
sensitivity. But the message was clear: With all due respect to John Totaro and 
Lee Samuels and Tom Cosentino and all the other fine young publicists who work 
for and with Top Rank, there is only one I. Rudd. 
</P>
<P>
Four weeks ago Wednesday, Rudd -- Unswerving Irving to his friends in the 
media, I. Rudd to himself and "The Bro" to Hearns and the rest of the Kronk 
Boxing Team -- went under the knife for coronary bypass surgery. Today, such 
operations are usually routine, even for 75-year-old men whose hearts have 
suffered the strain of working for both Arum and Don King in the same lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
But complications set in, respiratory difficulties, and Rudd has spent most of 
the past month on a respirator, incommunicado, while Gert, whom he always 
refers to as "my bride," sits by his side, waiting to hear the next anecdote 
about Jersey Joe Walcott or Jackie Robinson or Sugar Ray Leonard or Cardigan 
Bay or the days he spent working Jacobs Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For the unitiated, one did not get a suntan at Jacobs Beach -- it was that 
portion of Eighth Avenue in New York that was the center of the boxing world in 
the 1940s and '50s. On Jacobs Beach was the old Madison Square Garden, the 
office of matchmaker Mike Jacobs, and Stillman's Gym, where Rudd had his first 
exposure to boxing and characters such as Razor Phil Lewis, Mushky Jackson and 
Benny The Whoosh. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Rudd first worked his magic as the press agent for a Harlem fight club 
called the Rockland Palace, where outstanding black fighters such as Walcott, 
Tiger Jack Fox and Elmer "Violent" Ray fought weekly, largely ignored by the 
white media. He went on to work for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Yonkers Raceway 
(where his idea of deliberately misspelling the word as 'RACEWYA" on the 
marquee on opening day resulted in newspaper coverage across the country), King 
(for nine months) and, since 1978, Arum. Everybody who is anybody in New York 
sports knows Irving Rudd, and most have been helped by him in some way. Nobody, 
not even King, dislikes him. 
</P>
<P>
"Pure and simple, the man is a mensch," said Bill Mazer, the New York radio and 
television sportscaster along with whom Irving Rudd has been fighting the 
Battle of Brooklyn ever since Walter O'Malley moved Da Bums to the left coast 
in 1957. Mazer's favorite Irving Rudd story concerns the time someone observed 
that "Howard Cosell is his own worst enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Rudd: "Not while I'm alive." 
</P>
<P>
And Tom Kenville, Madison Square Garden's boxing publicist who worked for Top 
Rank with Rudd back in the late '70s, remembered when Irving, all 5-foot-3 of 
him, was assigned the job of babysitting Leon Spinks during his training for 
the rematch with Muhammad Ali in New Orleans. At the time, Spinks' disappearing 
acts made Houdini look like a bumbling amateur. Spinks' training consisted 
solely of hitting the heavy bag, and one day, a Japanese welterweight named Ryu 
Sorimachi -- who was fighting Carlos Palomino on the undercard -- was working 
the bag before an admiring bunch of Japanese tourists and refused to surrender 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Irving, if this guy doesn't get off the bag soon, Leon is going to disappear," 
Kenville told Rudd. "What are we going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
"Leave it to me," Rudd said. He walked over, whispered a few words to the 
Japanese contingent, and BINGO! -- everyone quickly dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
"What did you say to them?" Kenville asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told them if they didn't get lost, I was going to sing four choruses of 
'Remember Pearl Harbor,' " Rudd said. 
</P>
<P>
The word Wednesday was Rudd had made it through the rocky early rounds and is 
going to recover. He probably will return to work at some point. But this 
weekend, for the first time in 10 years, there will be a Thomas Hearns fight 
but no phone calls from Irving Rudd, pitching story ideas. No items about how 
Thomas visited a bunch of school kids, or beat Emanuel Steward out of $500 at 
the poker table, or challenged Isiah Thomas to a little one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
In their place are an abundance of Hearns-Rudd anecdotes culled from their 
12-year association, and in lieu of fresh material, they will have to do for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rudd on Hearns' closeness with a buck: "People always ask me if Thomas 
Hearns is cheap. I say, 'Not anymore.' When he was just starting out, he was 
cheap. Now that he's a great champion, he's frugal." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rudd on a rematch between Hearns and Marvin Hagler: "I'd rather see the two 
of them do lunch, and I want to see who picks up the tab, because I have a 
feeling cobwebs would grow around them before either guy makes a move." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hearns on Rudd's insistence that interviews be conducted at their 
previously agreed-upon time: "Irving, you suffer from the white man's disease: 
Punctuality." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rudd on his relationship with Hearns: "There's nothing I wouldn't do for 
him and there's nothing he wouldn't do for me. And that's how it's been for 10 
years now -- we've done nothing for each other." 
</P>
<P>
But more important, there is the Kronk jacket given him by Hearns that Rudd 
loves to wear, with the inscription, "Irving the Bro" on the breast, and there 
are the two huge floral arrangements in his hotel room sent by Hearns and his 
manager, Emanuel Steward. They know, even if the general public does not, that 
this time, someone very important is missing. 
</P>
<P>
So now it will be Mike Tyson vs. Henry Tillman, the man who beat Tyson twice as 
an amateur, on June 16 at Caesars Palace, and they're calling it "Hell to Pay." 
The co-feature will be George Foreman taking on Adilson Rodrigues, a much 
better match. 
</P>
<P>
Why, you might ask, would anyone wish to see Tyson fight Tillman, especially 
since Tillman has been knocked out by Evander Holyfield and Dwain Bonds and 
once retired for 22 months after losing to Canadian punching bag Willie deWit? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, there's only one explanation for "Hell to Pay." Although Tyson wants 
a rematch with Buster Douglas, he and his manager have told Tyson to go to 
hell, so Tillman's the poor sucker who's got to pay. Either that or Tyson made 
a deal with the devil -- or was it Don King? -- and now Hell is calling in its 
IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, "Hell to Pay" will be hell to watch.

MORNING BRIEFING: TOLEDO TEAM COUNTS ON MAYS, RHODES FOR ITS STRETCH DRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Toledo's baseball team travels by Shortway Bus Lines, and the 
driver is Willie Mays -- no relation to the Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
But Mays was not available last weekend, so they called in a replacement named 
Dusty Rhodes -- no relation to the famed pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1954 World Series, Mays made a memorable over-the-shoulder catch and 
Rhodes delivered the key pinch-hits as the New York Giants beat the Cleveland 
Indians in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Toledo baseball Coach Stan Sanders said, "It's a great baseball coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
That it is. But if they get another driver and tell us his name is Sal Maglie, 
well . . . 
</P>
<P>
Add Rhodes: After the '54 Series, he said: "They shoulda thrown me changeups. I 
couldn't hit a changeup, even if some Eskimo was pitching." 
</P>
<P>
More Rhodes: Of his fielding, Leo Durocher said: "Any time you see a fielder 
get under a ball and pound his glove -- even in Little League -- you know he's 
going to catch it. I have seen Rhodes pound his glove and have the ball fall 20 
feet behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What is the first name of Dusty Rhodes? 
</P>
<P>
Reaching out: From Hal Bodley of USA Today: "Those Bo Jackson telephone 
commercials come in handy. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday night, the Royals' charter to Baltimore was delayed on the ground in 
Toronto, causing Kansas City newspaper reporters anguish. Deadlines were 
approaching; they had planned to file stories after arriving in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear not. Bo reached into his bag of tricks and produced a cellular phone, and 
the reporters called their newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Sour relations: From the Pittsburgh Press: "Fifty years ago: Chicago Cubs owner 
Phil Wrigley said he would 'get rid of' Dizzy Dean 'if his eccentricities 
contaminate my ballclub.' Dean was in hot water with Wrigley for calling 
Manager Gabby Hartnett 'a picklepuss.' " 
</P>
<P>
Slick southpaw: The nickname for left-hander Rafael Valdez of San Diego is 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
Double trouble: When the Oakland Athletics played their double-A farm club in 
Huntsville, Ala., Monday night, Jose Canseco was three for three, with two 
doubles, before sitting down. His twin brother, Ozzie, hit a homer as 
Huntsville won, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
When Ozzie homered, Jose rushed out of the Oakland dugout and gave him a 
forearm bash. 
</P>
<P>
Bunny-hoppers: On the early line, the ones to catch in the Jack in the Box 
women's mile May 20 at UCLA are Buffy Rabbitt of UC Irvine and Anne Hare of New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Word of warning: From Sid Wing, captain of the USC old-timers who will face 
UCLA in a legends relay Saturday at the Coliseum: "Tell the Bruins that if they 
win, they're going to be tested for steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Still agitating: In the wake of the rumble in Detroit, called "Malice at the 
Palace," Philadelphia's Charles Barkley said, "If we play the Pistons again in 
the playoffs, they'll need the three-knockdown rule." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: James. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, on the playoffs: "We expect to 
go all the way." HARLEY TINKHAM

ANOTHER LOCKOUT ON OPENING DAY?; 
</P>
<P>
TROUT: RANCHERS CLOSE STRETCH OF EAST WALKER RIVER, BUT MOST FISHERMEN WOULDN'T 
GO THERE ANYWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ranchers and the anglers are at it again. 
</P>
<P>
With the Eastern Sierra trout season opening Saturday, the Plymouth Land and 
Livestock Company of Nevada posted signs Thursday, closing a stretch of the 
East Walker River north of Bridgeport to trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
That is the same trophy trout fishery severely damaged by silting when the 
Walker River Irrigation District -- a group of Nevada ranchers -- released a 
large volume of water from Bridgeport Reservoir in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The irrigation district subsequently was convicted of violations of the 
California Fish and Game Code and ordered to mitigate the damage and maintain 
controlled water levels and flows in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for this week's posting was not immediately clear, but fishing 
interests suspected vindictiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they were worried about a fly fisherman hooking a cow," said Jim 
Edmondson, regional manager for the fishing lobby, Cal Trout. 
</P>
<P>
Edmondson scheduled a press briefing this afternoon in Bishop to outline Cal 
Trout's response. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was uncertain how the posting would be enforced, or whether it 
would be enforced at all. 
</P>
<P>
Mono County Sheriff Martin Strelneck said that in trespassing situations, there 
must first be a complaint, after which a violator is asked to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"If he refuses, then there's a violation," Strelneck said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Rockel of Ken's Sporting Goods in Bridgeport pointed out a state law 
permitting public access to private lands where the center line of an adjacent 
highway is within 50 feet of the high-water mark. An angler, for example, could 
fish that water as long as he remained within the high-water marks on both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
Strelneck also said that the Department of Fish and Game might have primary 
jurisdiction when trespassing involves hunting or fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the posting covered only a mile from the Bridgeport dam to the 
bridge where California 182 crosses the river -- the area most heavily impacted 
by the '88 incident, where trout anglers wouldn't want to go now, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"All they've got down there is 20-pound carp," Strelneck said. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the posting were to be continued as far down as the choice area 
known as Murphy's Pond near the Nevada border, it could affect serious fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Some important points on this Eastern Sierra trout opening: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The limit, now statewide, has been cut from 10 to five fish a day, 10 in 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This will be the initial test of the DFG's promise to plant larger fish, 
from half a pound up, in exchange for cutting the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because of recent warm weather, any ice remaining on higher lakes is 
considered rotten and unsafe -- hence, ice fishing and exploring is being 
strongly discouraged, especially in view of the Convict Lake tragedy Feb. 19 in 
which seven people drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thursday was beautiful, but forecasters said a stormy cold front was moving 
in that could bring winds of up to 60 m.p.h. in the higher elevations by 
Saturday and snow down to 6,000 feet by Sunday, and 5,000 by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But, experts say, bad weather can mean good fishing, especially for larger 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gieser of Ken's Sporting Goods in Bridgeport said surface disturbance 
mistaken for insects sometimes brings small trout to the surface, with big 
browns in pursuit. Also, the fish aren't as sensitive to motors. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sharkey of Big Rock Resort at June Lake said: "The weather is always a 
question mark, but that doesn't bother the fishing -- only the fishermen." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone seeking a trophy brown will almost certainly be at Upper or Lower Twin, 
which in '89 also produced the largest catch for opening day and the season, 
22-8 by Jim Becker of Arcadia. Gieser recommends the strike-action trolling 
method: trolling fast with 13- to 18-size Rapalas. 
</P>
<P>
Fish up to five pounds should be common everywhere. Since last fall, the DFG 
has dumped thousands of older broodstock rainbows into every major lake. 
</P>
<P>
And during lulls in the wind, fly anglers should enjoy unusual opening-day 
success. A warm spring has brought early insect hatches. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the new limit, the 1990-91 state fishing regulations impose new 
restrictions on some waters. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in '88 Gene Cox of Rosamond caught a 12-4 brown in Rush Creek that 
was the largest fish on opening day, using a worm for bait. 
</P>
<P>
This year he will not be able to use a worm, and if he catches another fish 
that big, he will have to throw it back. Rush Creek, from Grant Lake to Mono 
Lake, now has 10-inch maximum size and artificial-lure restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers are urged to pay close attention to the new regulations. Generally, 
anglers 16 and older need licenses -- $21 at any tackle store. Fishing hours in 
Mono County (north of Bishop) are from an hour before sunrise to an hour after 
sunset. Fishing is allowed 24 hours in Inyo County (Bishop and south). 
Penalties for violations can range from $40 to $80. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook: 
</P>
<P>
Bishop area -- All of the streams and lakes have been heavily stocked, and 
knowledgeable anglers still loyal to troubled Crowley Lake should be rewarded, 
at least on the opening weekend, if the weather doesn't run them off the lake. 
There will be less water but more seclusion on the Owens River above and below 
Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth Area -- Hot Creek still hard to beat for fly fishing -- but that's all 
you can do there, and the limit is zero, since it's all catch and release. The 
Twin Lakes -- not to be confused with those near Bridgeport -- have been loaded 
with lunkers by the locals, but the roads are still closed to Lakes Mary, Mamie 
and George. 
</P>
<P>
June Lake loop -- Except for Grant, water level is no problem at these 
spring-fed lakes, and a late freeze in the off-season allowed a triple plant of 
brooders in June and Gull. Also, the mysterious cutthroat in June have grown to 
five or six pounds by now, but trolling is the only way to get them. Grant, as 
low as it is because of a court order to maintain a minimum level in Mono Lake, 
could be very productive. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgeport area: The Twin Lakes are the best for big fish. Although low, 
Bridgeport Reservoir will also be good for those who don't mind launching boats 
off the beach between the public ramp and the dam. The two regular ramps are 
high and dry. The Virginia Lakes have bad ice but are fishable.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: HIS FAREWELL TOUR APPARENTLY DIDN'T INCLUDE 
BROADCASTS

After a year away from basketball, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is interested in 
returning -- as a broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, in New York recently to appear on "Later With Bob Costas," met 
with Terry O'Neil, the executive producer of NBC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they talked about the possibility of Abdul-Jabbar being a 
part of next season's NBA coverage. Abdul-Jabbar said that what interested him 
most was studio work and/or features. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil said he plans to name an NBA coordinating producer in a month or so, and 
would get back to Abdul-Jabbar after that. 
</P>
<P>
An NBC spokesman, confirming the meeting took place, said the on-air 
personalities aren't expected to be named until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Emmys were presented in New York this week. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Besides Jim McKay, who won the first lifetime achievement award, the top 
individual winners were Al Michaels and John Madden, but neither was present. 
Michaels is in a contract dispute with ABC, and Madden, who does not fly, 
stayed home in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The award for best feature went to ESPN for a piece it did on Montreal 
pitcher Tim Burke going to Guatemala to pick up his 2-year-old adopted son. 
Chris Myers was the reporter, John Hamlin the producer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ABC was the big winner with 15 awards. CBS was second with five and ESPN 
third with three. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ABC won for sports journalism for its Bay Area earthquake coverage during 
the World Series. Its Indy 500 coverage was cited as the best live sports, 
"Monday Night Football" tied with ESPN's "Speedworld" for best live sports 
series, and "Trans-Antarctica! The International Expedition" won for 
best-edited special. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CBS won two awards for "NFL Today." Executive producer Ted Shaker, in 
accepting the awards, showed class by acknowledging former host Brent 
Musburger, who has been critical of Shaker since his April 1 firing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NFL Films won its 40th Emmy, with "This is the NFL" getting the award for 
best non-live series. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Independent producer Bud Greenspan won for film editing with "Calgary '88: 
16 Days of Glory," which was shown on the Disney Channel. It is Greenspan's 
fifth Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
Radio station KLAC held a reception at the Sheraton Universal Hotel Thursday 
evening to introduce its new sports-talk host, Gabe Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, former star of the ABC sitcom "Welcome Back, Kotter," begins as host of 
"Sportsnuts" Monday. The show will be broadcast weeknights 5 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, venturing into radio for the first time, said he plans to invite fellow 
comedians to take part in the first half-hour of the shows, then have celebrity 
guests the second half. He will take a few calls from listeners during both 
segments. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan landed the KLAC job when a mutual friend got him together with station 
general manager Norm Epstein. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said among guests already agreeing to take part are James Caan, Dick Van 
Patten, Jerry Buss, Jerry West and O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of your typical sports nut," Kaplan said. "I watch a lot of sports on 
television over the weekend, then talk about it during the week with friends. 
That's what I'm going to do on the show." 
</P>
<P>
Ratings game: The top-rated network sports show last weekend wasn't a baseball 
or basketball game, or the Long Beach Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
It was a 16-year-old fight -- Muhammad Ali's eighth-round knockout victory over 
George Foreman in Zaire. The replay of the 1974 fight, shown Saturday afternoon 
on NBC, drew a Los Angeles Nielsen rating of 4.6. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Angel-Twin game on CBS got a 3.0 rating in Los Angeles, Sunday's 
Boston-Philadelphia NBA game on CBS drew a 3.6, and the Grand Prix, blacked out 
in Los Angeles, averaged a 3.0 in other major markets on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
The Ali-Foreman fight is part of NBC's "Greatest Fights Ever" series. The next 
installment, to be shown May 12, will be the Ali-Joe Frazier "Thrilla in 
Manila." 
</P>
<P>
NBC's replay last year of the 1964 Ali-Sonny Liston fight won an Emmy for 
program achievement. It was the only sports Emmy NBC won. 
</P>
<P>
Add ratings: Channel 11's Dodger marathon didn't do very well. 
</P>
<P>
From 11 p.m. Friday night until the pregame show the following day at 6 p.m., 
the station averaged only a 1.6 Nielsen rating. The pregame show got a 5.0, and 
Saturday night's game, a 6-5 loss to Houston, got a solid 9.3. 
</P>
<P>
The fireworks that followed held a 4.1 rating. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Nathanson, the station's general manager, was pleased with the quality of 
the show. He stayed up baby-sitting his two-week-old niece and watched quite a 
bit of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was amazing how well it moved," Nathanson said. "But the ratings 
were a little lower than I thought they'd be." 
</P>
<P>
The SportsChannel regional network in the Bay Area recently used Willie Mays as 
a guest commentator on two Giant telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Chronicle's Tom Fitzgerald wrote: "When Brett Butler was 
thrown out on a close play at first base, Mays' only comment was: 'Damn!' 
</P>
<P>
"On the final pitch of the game, Robby Thompson tried to check his swing. As 
home plate umpire Dana Demuth pointed at first base umpire Tom Hallion, Mays 
cried, 'No-o-o-o.' 
</P>
<P>
"When Hallion ruled Thompson had swung, Mays yelled: 'Jesus Christ!' 
</P>
<P>
"This happened on Easter Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
CBS baseball is on hiatus until June 16, marking the first time in 38 years 
there will be baseball Saturdays without a network "Game of the Week." . . . 
Over the next three weekends, CBS will have NBA playoff doubleheaders on 
Saturdays and Sundays. The network will have a minimum of 57 hours of playoff 
coverage, about 10 more than the minimum scheduled last season. . . . During 
the first four days of the playoffs, which began Thursday, there will be 28 
hours of coverage on TNT, Prime Ticket and CBS combined, up from 20 during the 
same period last season. 
</P>
<P>
A new CBS pregame program, "The Basketball Show," with Pat O'Brien as host and 
Bill Raftery as studio analyst, makes its debut this weekend, airing at 9:30 
a.m. both days. . . . At 10 a.m. Saturday, CBS will show the New York Knicks 
vs. the Boston Celtics, with announcers Verne Lundquist and Billy Cunningham 
and reporter Lesley Visser. Cunningham is filling in for Lundquist's regular 
partner, Len Elmore, who had to bow out because of a personal commitment. . . . 
The second game Saturday, at 12:30 p.m., will be Indiana-Detroit, with James 
Brown, Tom Heinsohn and Jim Gray. . . . The Sunday lineup: Milwaukee-Chicago at 
10 a.m., with Greg Gumbel, Quinn Buckner and Andrea Joyce, followed by 
Houston-Lakers, with Dick Stockton, Hubie Brown and Tim Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
ABC will televise the finals of a nationwide three-on-three basketball 
tournament, Coup de Hoop, as part of "Wide World of Sports" June 23. Regional 
men's and women's competition begins in May, and the finals will be held at 
Muscle Beach in Venice June 16 and shown on ABC a week later. Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar is the honorary commissioner. More than $1 million in cash and 
prizes will be awarded, with some division winners getting as much as $100,000.

UCLA and Cal State Long Beach are all but assured berths in the NCAA men's 
volleyball Final Four after winning Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. 
tournament matches Thursday at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (23-4), the defending national champion, made short work of Stanford, 
15-11, 15-9, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Cal State Long Beach secured the other bid with a 9-15, 17-15, 
17-15, 15-11 victory over second-ranked USC. 
</P>
<P>
The Final Four is scheduled for May 4-5 at George Mason University in Fairfax, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and Cal State Long Beach play in the WIVA championship game Saturday at 
Northridge, with the winner receiving the conference's automatic qualifying 
berth. But even Saturday's loser, as the second-place finisher in a conference 
that has delivered all 20 NCAA champions, is a lock to advance as a wild card 
team. MIKE HISERMAN

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

CUBS' HARKEY LOSES NO-HITTER BUT BEATS PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs have been expecting great things from Mike Harkey ever since 
they selected him out of Cal State Fullerton in the first round of the 1987 
amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey lived up to expectations Thursday when the rookie right-hander took a 
no-hitter into the eighth inning against the San Diego Padres in the Cubs' 3-1 
victory at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Stephenson led off the bottom of the eighth with his first home run to end 
Harkey's bid to become the first Cub in 18 years to pitch a no-hitter. Milt 
Pappas beat the Padres, 8-0, on Sept. 2, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
After the home run, Harkey (2-1) was relieved by Mitch Williams, who earned his 
fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey, who was 2-7 during an injury-plagued season at Iowa last season, struck 
out five and walked two in his third start of the season. He got his first 
major league victory April 14 against the Pittsburgh Pirates before losing his 
next start against the New York Mets on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 2, San Francisco 1 -- Pirate left-hander John Smiley pitched a 
three-hitter to keep the Giants winless at home. The Giants' eighth consecutive 
home loss ties a club record. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Bream drove in the game-winning run with an eighth-inning single that gave 
the Pirates their first three-game sweep at Candlestick Park since July 11-13, 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, Atlanta 0 -- Craig Biggio's two-run homer at Atlanta helped the 
Astros end a three- game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Biggio's homer, his first, came off Derek Lilliquist after Eric Yelding opened 
the fifth inning with a bloop single. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Clancy (1-0) earned the win, allowing two hits in seven innings.

NEWPORT-TO-ENSENADA: SPECTACLE, THEN 125 MILES SOUTH ON THE WIND

<P>
About 500 boats will sail at noon today in the 43rd race from Newport Beach to 
Ensenada, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
This year's race drew 524 entries, down by about a dozen from last year, but 
usually not all start. 
</P>
<P>
The start off the Newport jetty is one of yachting's spectacles. Boats in the 
huge fleet maneuver for their respective starts, beginning at noon and 
continuing at 10-minute intervals until about 1:30. 
</P>
<P>
This year's fleet is divided among one class of Ultra-light 70-raters, two 
classes of smaller ultra-lights, two classes of International Offshore Rule 
(IOR) ratings, 11 classes of Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) and one 
class of Ocean Racing Catamarans (ORCA). 
</P>
<P>
The yachts should begin arriving in Ensenada, 125 miles down the coast, early 
Saturday, depending on wind conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding for first to finish and an elapsed-time record will be Dennis Conner of 
San Diego, the America's Cup skipper, in his 65-foot catamaran, Stars &amp; 
Stripes. The record is 10 hours 31 minutes, set by the 65-foot catamaran Double 
Bullet in 1983. Conner missed the record by about six hours last year when he 
ran out of wind off Rosarito Beach, south of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Also fighting for first to finish will be about six of the big monohull 
70-raters, which are known for their downwind speed in strong winds. ALMON

MCCALLUM GETS TRANSFER TO RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think Ulysses had a long voyage and a hard time returning home, check 
out the odyssey of Navy Lt. j.g. Napoleon McCallum, who returned to the Raiders 
Thursday after a four-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders reacquired McCallum from San Diego for a draft choice, thought to 
be a mid-round pick conditional on how much he plays. 
</P>
<P>
How convoluted is this? 
</P>
<P>
Raider official Steve Ortmayer helped draft McCallum for the Raiders, acquired 
him for the Chargers when he was San Diego general manager, and now, having 
returned to the Raiders, helped reacquire McCallum. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders say McCallum's Navy hitch, originally due to expire in December, 
will be up in July, thus freeing the Annapolis graduate to concentrate solely 
on football for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders drafted McCallum on the fourth round in 1986, everyone else having 
assumed that his naval commitment precluded the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
However, a favorable ruling from a friendly Secretary of the Navy allowed 
McCallum to try both. 
</P>

While serving aboard the U.S.S. Peleliu in Long Beach Harbor, McCallum had a 
decent rookie season -- 536 yards, a 3.8 average -- but showed little breakaway 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, the Navy changed secretaries and McCallum was reassigned to 
another ship far away from the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, it was the Raiders who reassigned McCallum, sending his rights to the 
Chargers as part of the Jim Lachey-John Clay deal. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Navy posted McCallum to San Diego as a recruiter and allowed him 
to try to double. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was the Chargers who reassigned him -- to their military reserve 
list.

CRESCENDO OF MEMORIES IN MOSCOW; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: IT WAS A HOMECOMING OF SORTS FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE ISRAEL 
PHILHARMONIC, ON ITS FIRST VISIT EVER TO THE SOVIET UNION.

Israeli composer Mark Kopyman's blue eyes twinkled Thursday with an excitement 
he could not contain as he described what he called "a meeting with my past." 
</P>
<P>
"Last night I saw the apartment off Gorky Street where I first lived with my 
wife, just after we were married," Kopyman said with a broad grin. "And the 
fruit stand where we used to shop -- it's there too." 
</P>
<P>
The Israel Philharmonic performed in the Soviet Union for the first time 
Thursday, but it was nevertheless a homecoming of sorts. A quarter of the 
orchestra's 112 members are Soviet emigres, and some were returning to their 
childhood home for the first time in decades. 
</P>
<P>
It is through their music that they are likely to best express the joy their 
return has awakened, and as the orchestra appears in Moscow, Leningrad and 
Riga, the Latvian capital, over the week ahead, an observer senses a deep 
emotionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Kopyman, 60, who was born in the Ukraine, has been gone for 18 years. He is 
back to hear his composition "Memory" performed in the country that was, in 
many ways, the source of his artistry. 
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to represent Israeli music," he said, "but it is a little strange 
that here I will be introduced as an Israeli composer, not a Soviet." 
</P>
<P>
Kopyman's music has been performed all over the world by the Israel 
Philharmonic, but the Soviet concerts hold an unmatched significance for him. 
In the audiences, he said, will be old school chums whose faces are now 
wrinkled with age, second cousins he recalls only from faded black-and-white 
photographs, scores of old comrades who are now, like him, balding and with 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"When my music is performed, it will be a little bit like a school exam," he 
said. "My old friends will be there, and I must demonstrate what I have been 
doing for these past 20 years, what I have accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
But before the first "exam," Thursday night in Moscow's Tchaikovsky Hall, 
Kopyman and other Soviet emigres were mainly interested in seeing old friends 
and sights, sharing memories and posing for a group photograph on Red Square, 
which many thought they would never see again. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, among the first countries to recognize Israel upon its 
creation in 1948, severed its ties to the Jewish state after Israel occupied 
Arab lands following the 1967 Six-Day War. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is still the main supplier of weapons to Israel's Arab 
enemies, but it has resumed relations with Israel, on a de facto basis, and 
this has enabled the orchestra to make the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Soviet emigres in the orchestra say it was the lack of creative 
freedom they felt in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s that drove them to 
leave -- and has cost this country some of its finest artists. 
</P>
<P>
"A quarter of the orchestra won't need interpreters, and that gives the 
Russians something to think about," said Zubin Mehta, the Israel Philharmonic's 
music director, before the tour began. 
</P>
<P>
First cellist Marcel Bergman, 40, left a dozen years ago in search of artistic 
freedom. He has made a life for himself so distant from the one he lived here 
that, he said, he has lost the once-vivid memory of himself as a young man 
living in the Ukrainian city of Lvov and studying music in Leningrad, the 
capital of the Russian Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel I once belonged here," he said over breakfast at the Rossiya 
Hotel. "I don't feel a part of it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Bergman now lives in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. He has an Israeli wife 
and they have an Israeli child and a second on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I left for pragmatic reasons, not emotional ones," he said. "I simply wanted 
my musical career to go further than I thought it could here. I came to realize 
that Israel was my real home. But I am still surprised that I feel so 
emotionless here. To me everything looks gloomy and gray -- the buildings, the 
streets, the people." 
</P>
<P>
Paya Yussim, a 43-year-old violinist from Riga, said she too was a little 
disappointed to see that Moscow looking "so much darker than I had remembered" 
after 23 years in warm and sunny Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But her homecoming was more emotional than Bergman's. She was met at the 
airport here by Vladimir Dukats, a cousin who was her closest childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so excited I was sweating," Dukats recalled. "I wondered whether we 
would feel the same closeness after all these years. But as soon as I saw her, 
there was no question. We have something eternal." 
</P>
<P>
The two cousins don't know when or if they will see each other again once the 
tour ends, on Thursday. So they hope to make the most of it, spending all the 
time they can together. 
</P>
<P>
For Yussim, the reunion is bittersweet, tinged with the sense that she has 
become a far different person since she last saw her cousin and the country of 
her birth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 20 years old when I left, and now I have a son who is 20," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems so long since I lived here. I am an Israeli, and I am proud to be an 
Israeli, but this is a piece of my life. And that is why it is so exciting to 
be performing here."

MOYERS ANALYZES APPEAL OF 'AMAZING GRACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How sweet the sound of a truly moving melody. Concerned parents, critics, 
generals and protest activists -- all would agree that there is transforming 
power in music. But can one solitary song, in and of itself, actually change 
lives en masse? 
</P>
<P>
Bill Moyers is hard-pressed to ascribe that much power to any song he knows of 
but one. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic' at Robert Kennedy's funeral, and I 
saw how that occasion lifted people from beyond themselves," says Moyers, who 
worked in the Johnson Administration before achieving fame as a TV journalist. 
"But I don't think I'd ever seen a song about which so many people confessed 
that it had actually transformed their seeing, their feeling, their way of 
looking at themselves and the world, as 'Amazing Grace.' " 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the belief that slave-trader-cum-minister John Newton's 19th-Century 
hymn is the most extraordinary composition known to our generation, and the 
knowledge that it remains the most recorded melody of the sound era, Moyers 
embarked on a mission to trace its impact -- from the abolition movement to the 
civil rights movement and beyond -- with a feature-length documentary film of 
the same name. Full of English history and modern Americana, Moyers' "Amazing 
Grace" has its local premiere tonight at 9 as part of the AFI Film Festival in 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly unlike any other hymn, "Amazing Grace" has taken on a hugely secular 
as well as religious life, moving beyond the Protestant church into the popular 
culture. Judy Collins, interviewed in the film, had a Top 20 single with it in 
1970. Opera singer Jessye Norman, likewise included in the documentary, hushed 
a rowdy rock throng at the Nelson Mandela birthday celebration two years ago in 
England by singing it a cappella. Decidedly non-churchy rock and country 
performers regularly include it in their acts. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere in some boundary indefinable, it connects the sacred and secular 
orders," said Moyers by phone from his New York office, in advance of his trip 
to Los Angeles for tonight's post-screening discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"It is truly a new country there. I think there's been a kind of stuttering 
start -- and the Joseph Campbell series ("The Power of Myth") was part of this 
-- of a deep and vital inquiry into the meaning of spiritual life in America 
today. And it's neither wholly spiritual nor wholly secular. And there are some 
hymns and poems that transcend either of those heretofore clearly defined 
boundaries. It's not church, but it's not 'street,' either." 
</P>
<P>
The hymn's crossover appeal lies in the fact that "it contains no 
ecclesiastical doctrine known as such," said Moyers. "No single denomination 
has proprietary claim to it. It evokes something from people rather than 
telling something to people. And what it evokes, I think, is simply that 
commonality of interest in the sublime that is a part of everyone's experience, 
I think, even if it cannot be articulated in theological language." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the film are interviews with a number of African Americans who are 
initially taken aback to learn that the hymn's composer was, in fact, a 
slave-ship captain before his conversion. Later, after he became a minister of 
the Church of England and denounced slavery as an evil, his diaries from that 
time became "perhaps the most important source of information about the slave 
trade for the abolition movement," Moyers noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It was news to many" of the blacks he interviewed, "but they somehow didn't 
seem surprised. Again, I think that's part of the recognition that this is a 
hymn that came from other than routine sources. I think they understood that 
there was some kind of power to it that they hadn't perceived before, which is 
actually why it spoke to them so incredibly, so richly." 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of 87 minutes, viewers are exposed to Newton's hymn dozens of 
times in dozens of wildly varying versions. Working on the documentary over the 
course of the last two years, Moyers necessarily heard it hundreds more times. 
Even the most graceless curmudgeon would have to acknowledge the song's 
inherent, lasting power, but honestly, now -- did Moyers never think at some 
point in the work that perhaps that he might not want to ever again hear some 
small-town soprano sing of the grace that saved a wretch like Newton? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I am being honest with you, I did not tire of it," said Moyers. "There are 
so many variations of it, and once you move beyond just simply the wonder at 
that, you begin to listen to the different inflections and the different 
styles. And so it's an endless study in the kaleidoscopic qualities of a 
powerful song and of music itself." 
</P>
<P>
Though "Amazing Grace" will air on Moyers' home network, PBS, in the fall, it 
is unlike most of his projects in that it will be seen to some extent on the 
big screen -- thanks to the urging of friend Norman Lear, who urged Moyers to 
exhibit it at festivals and in limited theatrical runs as "a community 
experience" greater than the "isolated experience" of television. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, it's a political film in one sense," said Moyers, "because it 
does create a momentary sense of a community, and that's what the best politics 
does." 
</P>
<P>
This project also differs from Moyers' others in that it includes no narration. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a line. But the people tell the story, and I'm simply carried along with 
it as a kind of unacknowledged accomplice. You always have to have a 
storyteller when you're telling a story, but the storyteller doesn't always 
have to tell the story. In television in particular, the storyteller can simply 
be a quiet presence around whom people organize their thoughts. We realized 
from the beginning that this would need no narration if we produced and 
directed it appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
Moyers has been the source of some controversy in recent years among certain 
segments of the church community, with accusations from some that "Politics and 
God" unfairly portrayed biblical inerrantists in the Baptist camp or that "The 
Power of Myth" promulgated New Age thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I come out of the evangelical tradition and know them much more than I come 
out of the fundamentalist tradition, and many evangelicals responded 
affirmatively to Campbell because they thought he was acknowledging the power 
of ritual and symbol in our experience," said Moyers. "But fundamentalists who 
like to reduce everything to the jot and tittle weren't that appreciative." 
</P>
<P>
Does he expect, then, to get back in their good graces, no pun intended, with 
this latest project? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably not. Because I'm not evangelizing, I'm not trying to make converts, 
I'm not trying to win souls, I'm not trying to promote a dogma. And there's 
nothing in the film that would restrict it to an exclusively Christian 
community."

Following are the Times' recommendations for today's schedule of the American 
Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with commentary by the 
film-reviewing staff. Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000. 
</P>
<P>
Highly recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"Heart of the Warrior"(U.S./Finland; Director: Stephen Peck; Century Plaza, 7 
p.m.). A compassionate, wrenchingly well-made film. Two wounded veterans of 
Vietnam and Afghanistan revisit the countries where they fought and compare 
experiences as amputees. The Afghan vet suggests that "people's heartlessness" 
must not get the better of them. In the face of films like this, heartlessness 
is not even a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"Berkeley in the '60s"(U.S.; Director: Mark Kitchell; AFI Mark Goodson, 9 
p.m.). Outstanding, a careful, balanced job on a complex, many-layered subject.

ART EXHIBIT ARRIVES AT LAX BRADLEY TERMINAL; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: 'FLIGHT' SHOW CONTAINS MODELS OF AIRCRAFT AND SPACECRAFT. THE DISPLAY 
INAUGURATES THE AIRPORT'S NEW EXHIBITIONS PROGRAM. 
</P>

Bleary-eyed travelers in and out of Los Angeles International Airport are used 
to having only such pastimes as people-watching, napping or reading to occupy 
their time between flights. But that is changing at the Tom Bradley 
International Terminal, where the airport has set up a "mini-gallery space" for 
a rotating exhibits program. 
</P>
<P>
The first exhibit in the "gallery" -- set up next to the terminal's 
departure-level center escalator -- is a show called "Flight." It contains more 
than 100 scale models of aircraft and spacecraft ranging from the Space Shuttle 
Columbia and the B-1 Stealth Bomber to the Wright Brothers Flyer and the 
Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so appropriate," said curator Francine Ellman, whose firm Art Source 
L.A. Inc., has been working on the $265,000 airport art project since August, 
1988. "What would be better than to put up a show about 'Flight' in an 
airport?" 
</P>
<P>
The art program's first project, called "Welcome to California," was installed 
in mid-March. It features photographs on long-term loan including a 
48-foot-long panoramic photographic mural of the Owens Valley in the terminal's 
arrival area, and four 8x10-foot scenic photos as well as a series of nine 
nightscapes in the departure areas of the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it will give a good cultural boost to the people who come to the 
airport," said Karl Rach, project director for the airport's art program. "The 
dwell time in the Tom Bradley Terminal is longer (than in other terminals), and 
the passengers are all here at least an hour to an hour-and-a-half. So we 
thought the public here could get a better feeling for L.A. (through the 
exhibits); they could see that the culture here is different than it is 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The project has been approved and funded only through next April, with two more 
exhibits already scheduled. After "Flight," which will end in August, Ellman 
plans to mount "Made in L.A.," a show of paintings, sculpture, furniture and 
jewelry by about 50 locally based artists, from September through December; and 
"The Art of the Movies," featuring costumes, makeup, set design, memorabilia, 
and models and artifacts used in the movies, from January through April. 
</P>
<P>
Ellman said early on that "nothing at all controversial" will be displayed. "We 
don't want anything that's offensive to anybody," said Ellman, who is also an 
art dealer and runs a small gallery on La Cienega Boulevard. "It's going in a 
public space, and so we're very conscious of that. (We) don't want letters 
about George Herms' sculpture, for instance," Ellman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellman noted that a main concern of the airport in instituting the art program 
has been the lack of space and the heavy traffic in the Bradley Terminal. That 
concern has already resulted in the program's allocated space being cut in 
half, Ellman said, noting that originally, the exhibits were to have occupied 
both sides of the departure level escalator, but have now been limited to one 
side. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ellman noted, although the exhibits will be of what she called 
museum quality (they are being designed by Tom Hartman, the chief of exhibits 
at UCLA's respected Wight Art Gallery), the airport is downplaying them so as 
not to draw additional traffic to the terminal, which serves an average of 5 
million passengers a year. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want people going out to see this like they would a museum," Ellman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the currently scheduled exhibits, the art program will be re-evaluated, 
Rach said, noting that the current $265,000 budget -- including $108,000 for 
Ellman's fees, $57,000 for permanent exhibit cases and $25,000 for each 
individual exhibit -- comes out of the airport's $200-million annual operating 
fund. That fund is generated from revenues from the airlines and concessions 
such as restaurants, parking lots and rental cars, Rach said. 
</P>
<P>
Rach added that if all goes well, the program, which was originated and 
approved by the airport's board of commissioners, may eventually be expanded to 
the other terminals.

A PHYSICIST'S BOOK ON GLOBAL WARMING INSPIRES TV MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new scientific book intended to promote understanding of the greenhouse 
effect is being used as the basis for a fictional TV movie examining what life 
will be like for a group of people in 30 to 40 years if global temperatures 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Robert Greenwald calls the proposed movie, currently in development 
for ABC, a "futuristic 'Grapes of Wrath.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is being adapted by Dennis Nemec from "Dead Heat: The Race Against the 
Greenhouse Effect," by Robert Boyle and Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric 
physicist and senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, it's set in Oppenheimer's world, and 
it's not too far ahead," Greenwald said. "It will be about a family that's on 
the road in search of a liveable habitat, as the environmental destruction has 
raised havoc." 
</P>
<P>
The scenario, in part, as described in "Dead Heat": "The global economy will 
gradually feel the strain of the warming as farms, industries and tens of 
millions of people are forced to migrate and then move again; as natural 
resources are stretched to the limit and finally are exhausted; as conflicts 
erupt in the struggle over what remains." 
</P>
<P>
The project began, Greenwald said, when he consulted the Environmental Media 
Assn. about doing a film about global warming and was told he should get in 
touch with Oppenheimer. "Dead Heat" had not yet gone to print, but Greenwald 
read the manuscript and decided to make his movie. 
</P>
<P>
"It was based, first and foremost, on the opening chapter of his book, which 
was the most devastating and potent description of what our future will look 
like, in a very practical and specific way," said Greenwald, whose TV movie 
credits include "The Burning Bed," "Daddy," "A Deadly Silence" and the upcoming 
"Hiroshima." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that some scientists do not agree with Oppenheimer's grim predictions 
for the future will not affect the project, Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hypothetical case about what could happen, based on a significant 
amount of scientific knowledge," he said.

RAPE STORY SPURS NEW DEBATE ABOUT NAMING VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two months ago, a 29-year-old Iowa mother of two challenged the way Americans 
view victims of rape. 
</P>
<P>
She did it by allowing a newspaper, the Des Moines Register, to print the story 
of her Nov. 19, 1988, rape and its aftermath -- her struggles to overcome her 
fear, tell her children, make love with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
And she allowed the newspaper to print her name -- Nancy Ziegenmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegenmeyer's decision, and her story, which was printed on five consecutive 
days in excruciating detail, prompted a flurry of debate about media coverage 
of rape. In the following weeks, Ziegenmeyer, who operates a child-care service 
in Grinnell, Iowa, has appeared on "Donahue" and "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the debate is the argument that by not printing or broadcasting 
rape victims' names -- by treating rape differently from other violent crimes 
-- the media perpetuate a stigma of guilt, of shame. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma is not easily resolved, for it weighs what some see as the good of 
many against the rights of the individual -- the rape victim who may feel a 
compelling need for privacy. Ironically, it has put many journalists in what 
must seem an alien position of arguing on the side of withholding information. 
</P>
<P>
Editors at papers such as the New York Times and the San Jose Mercury News find 
themselves at just such odds. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy is to always try and maximize the amount of information you can 
give to the reader," says John Darnton, metropolitan editor of the New York 
Times. "I find it undesirable to say to the readers, 'We know but we aren't 
including it.' I find it almost arrogant." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, disclosing the names of rape victims, he says, is "a fine 
principle in the abstract, but it becomes very sticky case by case." 
</P>
<P>
James I. Houck, managing editor of the Baltimore Sun, expresses similar 
sentiments: "Though identifying rape victims may help remove a stigma, I am not 
sure that I want to make that decision for a rape victim who has undergone 
substantial trauma and will continue to undergo substantial trauma." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, he says, the Baltimore Sun does not print the names of rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
But for at least 25 years, the Shelton-Mason County Journal in Washington state 
has routinely published the names of sexual assault victims, male or female, 
when they appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Managing Editor Charles Gay views the policy as part of fair trial coverage. 
The act of withholding a victim's name while identifying the suspect implies 
the latter's guilt, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the person is the victim there should be no reason why she should be 
ashamed of what's happened to her, although that's the way society apparently 
feels she should feel. It is sad that she cannot get on the stand without 
fear." 
</P>
<P>
The complexity of the media's dilemma has been illuminated by the case of the 
jogger raped last year in Central Park. Despite the extraordinary amount of 
publicity surrounding the case, most newspapers and television stations have 
refrained from identifying her. But, asks Darnton, what if that restraint ends 
when the case goes to court and some news organization discloses her name? 
</P>
<P>
"What do we do if she takes the stand? . . . If all the papers identified her, 
and the TV stations, you might reach the point of looking like an absurdist 
holdout" for refraining. 
</P>
<P>
Three states -- Florida, Georgia and South Carolina -- have laws that prohibit 
identifying victims of sexual crimes. But even those laws have been in legal 
limbo since a 1989 Supreme Court ruling overturned a $97,500 damage suit 
verdict against the Florida Star, a small Jacksonville paper that published -- 
inadvertently, the paper said -- the name of a rape victim after the name had 
been included in a police report. 
</P>
<P>
To some, these laws are a symbol of the stigma. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they are a Southern embodiment of views on women," says George Rahdert, 
a First Amendment lawyer for the the New York Times and Florida's St. 
Petersburg Times who represented the Florida Star in its case. 
</P>
<P>
In other states, withholding rape victims' names traditionally has been left up 
to newspaper and television editors. And to some, that is part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of men, white men, who are making decisions for women," says 
Irene Nolan, managing editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal. "I do think 
that by not printing the names we are treating the rape victims differently and 
that we are helping to perpetuate a stigma and that we are being patronizing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Courier-Journal doesn't publish names of rape victims without 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
"The emotions (about rape) run very deep and we have not changed the policy, 
and I don't think that society is ready for it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that the stigma exists, says Cecilia Carroll, executive director 
of Baltimore's Sexual Assault Recovery Center. "I don't think that the media is 
buying into a myth. They are recognizing the fact that there is a stigma." 
</P>
<P>
Until the myth is dispelled, naming rape victims will deter women from 
reporting the crime, says Wanda Robinson, chief of Baltimore's sex offense unit 
in the state's attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Rape is a crime of violence. Society sometimes forgets that and thinks of it 
as a crime of sex, of intercourse," she says. "Until people get past that 
element -- that rape is 'sex' -- then I don't think that rape victims can or 
should be revealed." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Ziegenmeyer chose to step forward despite -- or perhaps because of -- 
that stigma. Months before Ziegenmeyer's story was written, Geneva Overholser, 
editor of the Des Moines Register, wrote a column urging rape victims to come 
forward. "As long as rape is deemed unspeakable -- and is therefore not fully 
and honestly spoken of -- the public outrage will be muted as well," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The column found its mark. Ziegenmeyer read it, called Overholser and told of 
her rape nine months earlier. In late February, one month after her assailant, 
Bobby Lee Smith, was sentenced to life in prison without parole, Ziegenmeyer's 
story was published on the front page. 
</P>
<P>
In Des Moines, reader response was positive enough for the paper to change its 
policy for reporting rapes, David Westphal, managing editor, said. Still, a 
name is not printed without the victim's consent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our present tack is to try to be more aggressive in inquiring of victims 
whether they wish to have their names printed," he says. The new policy is 
based on the belief that "the stigma of rape is extremely powerful in part 
because of the mystery."

WHEN PARENTING GOES OVERBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY JO KOCHAKIAN, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time her daughter and son-in-law fought, Mom would be up most of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Worrying. Obsessing. Coming up with more advice for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The fights were harder on Mom than on the young couple, who often kissed and 
made up while she was still awake, worrying. 
</P>
<P>
This mother's problem, says therapist Laurie Ashner, is "overparenting." She 
couldn't relinquish control of her daughter's life. And it diminished her own. 
</P>
<P>
There have always been parents who are overinvolved with their children, says 
Ashner, co-author with psychologist Mitch Meyerson of "When Parents Love Too 
Much" (Morrow). 
</P>
<P>
Extreme cases usually stem from childhood experiences, Ashner says -- a lack of 
love or acceptance, very demanding and critical parents, or emotional or 
physical abuse. "This creates a victim -- somebody who feels they always have 
to be in control, that they have to be perfect, giving to others, in order to 
get what they need in return," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But a parent who feels guilty can become overinvolved as well, she says. 
Divorced parents try to compensate for the absence of the other. Parents whose 
work schedules leave little time at home may go overboard in trying to make 
things all right for the children. Deficient marriages may lead others to seek, 
inappropriately, solace in their relationships with their children. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between being a concerned and an overconcerned parent can 
sometimes seem a fine distinction. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a pattern. "You recognize that you are thinking and stewing and 
worrying about your children, especially when your children have a problem." 
And for such parents, "This can mean the child gets a B instead of an A." 
</P>
<P>
"So you find that you are stewing over this, and you wonder . . . why your 
children are always saying to you, 'Back off. I'm fine. Leave me alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
These children often grow up to be very self-critical, and sometimes so 
immobilized by fear of failure that they become underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times it's because of the parents' having really high expectations, 
or harming the child's competence by doing too much for them." 
</P>
<P>
The grown children often have problems with intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking of a 38-year-old man whose mother still buys his socks and 
underwear," Ashner says. "She walks around his house picking up things, asking 
how much he paid for them. . . . He's been fending her off for years. She's 
worried. She wants to know what's happening in his life. Well, now he thinks 
every woman's like this. And he thinks that if he gets close to a woman, she's 
going to devour him." 
</P>
<P>
The pattern is difficult to break, and therapy is often needed, Ashner says. It 
worked for the mother who became overwrought whenever her daughter and 
son-in-law had a spat. She figured out it was better to listen but not give 
advice, as time often solved the problem. "If she felt absolutely out of 
control, she talked to a friend or her husband about it, but she tried to not 
throw herself into the middle of the marriage anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The authors offer this advice to overinvolved parents: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stop trying to be the perfect parent. Don't torture yourself about past 
errors; quit brooding about what you think are problems for your children and 
focus on enjoying them as they are. Don't make demands because of your own need 
for their lives to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Learn self-acceptance. Examine your relationship with your own parents to 
understand where you acquired negative feelings about yourself. Learn to 
acknowledge the good things you do. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seek support in therapy or self-help groups. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Develop your own interests so you can abandon the role of "problem solver." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Break the pattern of "crisis thinking." Don't automatically act on 
emotional impulse. Wait, consider, use logical thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Learn to let go of control. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Work on making your marriage healthy and satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stop giving in to children who have learned to be irresponsible, and don't 
let them exploit your patience.

FANS OF JANET JACKSON PAY HOMAGE TO HER BY SHOWING UP AT CONCERTS IN LOOK-ALIKE 
CLOTHES

<P>
The mountain of curly black hair, the motorcycle-style leather jacket, the 
basic black outfit underneath. And oh yes, the signature house-key as earring 
were all out in full force this week as Janet Jackson wanna-bes swarmed to see 
her perform at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, was that Janet Jackson standing in line for her own concert? No, but you 
sure could have fooled most people. 
</P>
<P>
The look-alikes were all ages -- from 10 to thirtysomething. Vanessa Simmons, 
10, wore all black with an "1814" pin, the name of Jackson's latest album, and 
a baseball cap with the words "Rhythm Nation" printed on it. That's the name of 
Jackson's tour. Lisa Hewett and Beatricz Giraldo wore Jackson's big-hair style 
and key earrings. 
</P>
<P>
D'LaVance, Rea Black and Arnold Brown, other concert-goers this week, could 
pass for a Jackson family portrait. From the silver buckles on D'LaVance's 
leather jacket to Black's oversized key earring, their wardrobes were exact. 
</P>
<P>
"Janet is my favorite singer and dancer," explained Betty Maine, 9, who wore a 
Janet Jackson T-shirt to the show. "I want to be just like her." 
</P>
<P>
Once the show began, there was no mistaking the real Janet Jackson. She was 
definitely the one on stage. 
</P>

NEW THEODORE MOVES INTO MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new Theodore was born March 1 to retailer Herbert Fink. Theodore Beach in 
Malibu is No. 10 in the Fink family of specialty stores. There are eight 
sibling Theodores (using such aliases as Theodore By Design and Contents by 
Theodore) stretching from Newport Beach to Woodland Hills. Fink also owns two 
French designer boutiques, Sonia Rykiel and Claude Montana, on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
You'll recognize the sand-and-surf version of Theodore when you see it. The 
store has the family look: The displays are slick; rolling library ladders are 
used to reach the uppermost shelves; there are lots of little baubles to touch 
in colorful baskets. The apparel prices range from three to four digits and the 
sales personnel are helpful rather than the decorative but non-functional types 
you find in so many boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
Fink uses a successful recipe for his stores. He fills the racks with the 
sportiest offerings by some of Europe's most sophisticated designers -- Issey 
Miyake and Byblos, for example -- and he mixes in hey-look-at-me-clothes the 
local body beautifuls like to wear. 
</P>
<P>
The Theodore stores are the backbone of the Fink fashion empire. They fill the 
coffers that support the money-losing Montana boutique. Fink claims the 
free-standing Montana shop brought him status and respectability on Rodeo 
Drive, but it is the Theodore store on the same street that pays both rents. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Beach is the most laid-back of the Theo group, but it's nothing like 
the local surf shops. There are minuscule bikinis and blue jeans, to be sure, 
but at $225 for the white fringed swimsuit by St. Tropez and $340 for Blue 
System's jeans with hand-painted dragons crawling up the legs, the resemblance 
is short lived. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Beach, Fink says, is a "very elitist type of casual." 
</P>
<P>
For example: What looks like a chambray work shirt hanging on one rack is, in 
fact, a washed silk work shirt by GoSilk for $230. Floral print linen jackets 
are one of the spring staples, but at Theodore, the colors are brighter, the 
patterns are bolder, the label is Byblos and the price is $555. Cotton knit 
dresses from Sonia Rykiel are priced from $170, and knit separates from 
Dorothee Bis go for $110. Theodore's private label, Theodore Design Studio, 
designed by Fink's wife, Norma, start at $45 for rayon separates. 
</P>
<P>
Alain Mikli sunglasses, Kenzo black linen boots, Liza Bruce swimwear, watches 
by Daniel Mink, and Kenzo and Byblos shoes fill out the accessory displays. 
</P>
<P>
On the men's side of the store, white linen jackets, a must for any 
semi-socially active beach dweller, are available from Claude Montana for 
$1,370; they have his signature body-shaping seams and large silver buttons. 
Just because it's L.A., there is a Montana black leather jacket (the pinnacle 
of black leatherness) for $2,185. There are Hawaiian shirts, by the British 
designers Keith Varty and Alan Cleaver, for the Italian line Byblos. 
</P>
<P>
The store's decor reflects its beach setting. The sun-washed white walls, sisal 
carpet and rattan furnishings are de rigueur ocean-front decorating touches. 
The merchandise would look equally as appropriate along the Wilshire corridor. 
This is an uptown boutique that happens to be seaside. It is for those Theodore 
customers who just can't make the drive into town with the regularity they used 
to. "We save them miles, but no money," said Fink bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Beach in Malibu is in the pink shopping center next to the Malibu 
Colony at 23733 W. Malibu Road; (213) 456-7719.

'FOOT-DRAGGING' CHARGED IN UC PROBES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: REP. DANA ROHRABACHER URGES SWIFT COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
ADMISSION PRACTICES AT SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The U.S. Department of Education is "foot-dragging" in investigating admissions 
practices at UCLA, UC Berkeley and Harvard University that allegedly 
discriminate against Asian-Americans, an Orange County congressman told a 
congressional subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually no progress has been made regarding the (investigation of) college 
admissions discrimination," Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) told members of the 
House Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on education. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, who represents northwestern Orange County, asked the panel to 
earmark $250,000 of the nearly $50 million requested by the Education 
Department's Office of Civil Rights to complete the current investigations and 
begin new ones. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights office began a "compliance review" of admission practices at 
UCLA in January, 1988; at Harvard in July, 1988; and at Berkeley in July of 
last year. Earlier this month, the office announced it would begin a similar 
review at Boalt Hall, UC Berkeley's law school. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Education Department said Thursday that the investigations 
at Harvard and UCLA will be completed "shortly," but had no other comment on 
Rohrabacher's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher contends that institutions such as Berkeley and Harvard have kept 
out some qualified Asian-American applicants to keep spaces open for less 
qualified blacks and Latinos under university affirmative action plans. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Rohrabacher introduced a "sense of Congress" resolution calling 
for federal investigations of the consideration of race in university 
admissions. The controversial resolution, which has about 75 co-sponsors, so 
far has languished in two House committees. 
</P>
<P>
Many Asian-American leaders, while critical of some college admissions 
practices, have complained that Rohrabacher's effort really is a not-so-veiled 
conservative attack on the concept of affirmative action. That policy extends 
special recognition in hiring and admissions practices to minorities who 
historically have been the object of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"Rohrabacher . . . (is) trying to use the so-called Asian complaint as a ruse 
to go after student affirmative action programs," said Henry Der, a member of 
Asian-American Task Force on University Admissions in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old organization in recent years successfully negotiated changes in 
UC Berkeley's admissions practices that the task force believed discriminated 
against Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not asked for the U.S. Department of Education's involvement. . . ," 
Der said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite occasional problems, Der said, affirmative action "is an essential 
program as part of higher education in America." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), the vocal opponent of 
Rohrabacher's House resolution, said Matsui nevertheless agrees with 
Rohrabacher that the Education Department inquiries have taken too long. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something we've been saying for a long time," said Steve Oddo, Matsui's 
press secretary. Oddo said it would probably require more than money to get the 
job done. "It's going to take an attitude adjustment over there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher has said previously that he supports affirmative action programs 
that have been ruled legal by the U.S. Supreme Court, but objects to any use of 
racial quotas in university admissions.

DOG TURNS ON ITS OWNER, IS SHOT TO DEATH BY POLICE

<P>
Betty Malberg called it "a classic case of biting the hand" that feeds him. 
</P>
<P>
In this case the offender was Excalibur, the family-pet-turned-vicious-dog, who 
was shot and killed by Cypress police when it turned on Malberg for no apparent 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
A licensed dog breeder, Malberg was feeding the 9-year-old boxer in her back 
yard Wednesday night when the canine attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very unusual," she said. "He started out playing with me, then he began 
nibbling, and then . . . he got carried away. He began chewing on my left arm." 
</P>
<P>
The 80-pound fawn and white boxer, known affectionately by the nickname Cal, 
pinned her against a chain-link gate and continued to snap at her left arm. A 
neighbor called police, and officers arrived to find Malberg's back up against 
the fence, fending off the snarling, attacking boxer. 
</P>
<P>
"They fired one shot in the air and asked me what should they do," Malberg 
said. "I said, 'Shoot him!' " 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the dog charged at the officers, shots were fired, and Malberg turned 
to see Excalibur fall to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Malberg, 59, was treated by paramedics before being taken to La Palma 
Intercommunity Hospital where she received several stitches for multiple dog 
bites. 
</P>
<P>
She praised the officers' handling of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"To be very frank, I didn't like that dog,' Malberg said, noting that Cal was 
normally handled by her ailing husband, Eddie. "He was rough. He was a man's 
dog."

CANCER? DON'T WORRY, JUST BE NICE: KABC-TV, Channel 7, is one of two California 
TV stations(the other's in Fresno) that is refusing to run one of the state's 
new anti-smoking ads. You've probably seen or heard some of the commercials. 
They get right to the point: Smoking stinks. But KABC says the one showing 
tobacco execs fretting about replacing all the smokers who are either quitting 
the habit or dying makes the cigarette pushers look like bad guys. In the ad, 
one of the tobacco honchos says with a laugh, "Gentleman, we're not in this 
business for our health." So maybe the commercial isn't funny and, you're 
right, KABC, it isn't nice. But it's true. 
</P>
<P>
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE: Fathom this if you thought commercials in 
movie theaters were about as low as advertisers could sink. Now mini billboards 
are hanging on the inside doors of public restroom stalls. One advertiser who 
posted his message in the bathroom of a Costa Mesa restaurant urges readers to 
mention his ad for a discount. Gee, do I really have to?

TEACHER, TEACHER, I DECLARE: Teachers protesting stalled contract negotiations 
have stopped assigning homework at Foothill High School in the Tustin Unified 
School District. This is every kid's dream, right? Not at Foothill High, it 
isn't. Some 1,000 students staged a sit-in, on school time, to complain that 
they weren't learning. One 17-year-old said she felt as if she were in the 
third grade, reading aloud in class. " 'Hamlet' read aloud in class does not do 
it justice," she complained. So you want homework? Do homework. Only 
third-graders wait for their teachers to spoon-feed them assignments.

DUKE TO MOONBEAM: SO WHO KNEW?: Former Gov. Jerry Brown came in for a lot of 
flak over his handling of the war on the Medfly. Many think it cost him his 
job. Weak-kneed, they called him. A real fruit. Now the flies are circling 
again amid rumblings about Deukmejian's own Vietnam. Turns out the state may 
not keep its promise to end aerial malathion spraying by May 9. The little 
buggers keep popping up, even in areas that have been sprayed repeatedly. Some 
experts are saying the flies have already won the war hands down. The wonders 
of nature never cease to amaze. Vanquishing a fruit in the governor's office 
may have been expected, but now the Medfly is making headway against the armor 
of the Iron Duke. 
</P>
<P>
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL EARTHY: The Arvida Co., a developer planning to build 
5,000 homes in San Clemente, has imported 2,000 sheep instead of heavy 
machinery to clear the hills of grass and scrub brush. "And there won't be any 
pollutants released into the air," says company VP Horst Schor. Maybe not. But 
I wouldn't want to stroll through there without a pair of heavy boots on. 
</P>
<P>
TAKING AIM: I sighted this bumper sticker on the back of a pickup truck headed 
south on the 405 the other day: "My wife, yes. . . . My dog, maybe. . . . My 
gun, never." No comment. I'm unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
A WORKING-CLASS HERO: You've all heard the song by John Lennon, and by now, 
you've all probably heard about the photograph. It appeared on the cover of 
Rolling Stone and the other day, in this newspaper. A nude Lennon is curled up 
against Yoko Ono, who is fully clothed. He's kissing her. Some trustees of 
Fullerton's Muckenthaler Cultural Center thought it should be pulled from the 
museum's "Heroes, Heroines, Idols and Icons" exhibit. The reasons, for public 
consumption, varied. Some said it didn't fit with the hero theme, that it made 
Lennon look weak. Annie Leibovitz, who shot the photograph on the day Lennon 
was murdered, says he loved it. "The photograph shows he was never afraid to 
show how human he was," Leibovitz says. Heroes come in many different guises, 
but they have at least one thing in common: their humanity. 
</P>
<P>
AND HE LEAVES HAIR ALL OVER THE SINK: A new poll by the Roper Organization 
shows that American women think men are meaner, more manipulative, 
self-centered, lazy and sexist than they were 20 years ago. The survey, which 
interviewed 3,000 women across the country, asked the same questions that it 
put to American women in 1970. But the study's authors think men really haven't 
changed all that much. They say women are just expecting more and not getting 
it. The bottom line: More than nine out of 10 women said marriage is still 
better than living alone. Oh, well. At least it must have felt good to get all 
that other stuff off their chests.

4 ARRESTED UNDER JOB-SOLICITING LAW 
</P>

<P>
A crackdown on day laborers who seek work on street corners and in parking lots 
began Thursday as four workers were arrested for violating a new city ordinance 
that makes it illegal to solicit jobs on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Police issued citations to four Latino men, checked their identification and 
determined that they were not legal residents, Mayor Don E. Smith said. The men 
were then taken to the U.S. Border Patrol station near San Clemente for 
deportation, Smith said. A fifth man picked up for jaywalking was also taken to 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalties for violating the ordinance are a $1,000 fine and six 
months in jail. Illegal immigrants also face deportation. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, adopted by the City Council last September, went into effect 
Wednesday. On the first day of enforcement, police delivered flyers explaining 
the ordinance to workers congregating along the commercial strip of East 
Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
No one was arrested for job solicitation on Wednesday, but two men were 
arrested for other violations and delivered to border officials, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Street corners have been quiet since the ordinance went into effect. "There's 
not near as many walking the streets," Smith said of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, immigrant-rights groups protested city measures to control job 
solicitation by dayworkers when, in response to complaints by local merchants, 
police stopped scores of men along East Chapman Avenue for violations such as 
jaywalking, littering and driving vehicles with expired registrations. 
</P>
<P>
Those who could not provide identification were handed over to immigration 
officials for possible deportation. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no protest of the new ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business was brisk at the city's hiring hall, with twice the average 
number of workers placed in jobs, a spokeswoman said. During the hall's first 
month of operation, there was an average of 12 employer-worker matches daily, 
but on Thursday, 24 men and women found work through the center. 
</P>
<P>
The number of workers and employers using the hall was also above average on 
Thursday, with participation by 274 workers and eight employers compared to a 
daily average of 230 workers and five employers. MARY HELEN BERG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;

<P>
HOMELESS HAVE PLANS FOR THEIR $3,308

When city workers twice confiscated and discarded Pat Ford's clothes, bedrolls 
and other personal property two summers ago, they made life on the streets 
around the Santa Ana Civic Center even more difficult for the 46-year-old 
homeless man. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to go for two weeks in the same clothes. I would take a shower but then 
dress in the same dirty clothes," Ford said. "Then when I got some more, they 
wiped me out again. It was downright thievery." 
</P>
<P>
But Ford and 16 other homeless people refused to let the city's action pass 
without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
They sued Santa Ana, and on Thursday, many of them received a check for $3,308 
as part of the $50,000 out-of-court settlement reached with the city earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Each plaintiff had different plans for their chunk of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they would open savings accounts or attempt to buy a home, while 
others planned to take vacations or get medical treatment. One man said he 
would simply cash the check and carry the money with him, admitting that it may 
make him an easy target for robbers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them agreed that the money would help them build a better life for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I can't express my feelings. . . . It's helping me live life again," said 
Beulah Robison, a 58-year-old woman who now works as a live-in maid for an 
elderly man in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Robison plans to open a savings account, get a new pair of glasses and buy her 
granddaughter a present with the money. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit stemed from a Santa Ana policy begun in 1988 of discarding the 
possessions of homeless people during periodic citywide cleanup campaigns at 
parks and public places. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana has since stopped throwing away the property and now keep all 
collected belongings in a storage facility at Eddy West Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, city workers will also give the estimated 1,500 homeless 
people who live in Santa Ana time to move their property before the cleanups 
begin. SHELBY GRAD

MOST TEACHERS SKIP SCHOOL'S OPEN HOUSE

<P>
A teachers' boycott of the annual open house at Foothill High School left only 
six to eight teachers to greet a light turnout of about 120 parents Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
George Waibel, a music teacher and president of the Foothill Faculty Club, read 
a brief statement to parents at a general meeting before the open house: "We 
the teachers of Foothill High School have chosen not to participate in 
tonight's open house to express our displeasure and dismay concerning the 
continuing state of contract negotiations conducted by your elected 
representatives. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Waibel said the school's teachers voted 51 to 3 last week to boycott the open 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents were supportive of the teachers' stand and others were upset by 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Ebert, who has a daughter and a son at Foothill High, said the teachers 
are "just not doing their job. In any other profession, you would get sued for 
that action." 
</P>
<P>
But John Logan, whose daughter attends Foothill, said, "I think they're 
underpaid and frustrated, and that leads to decisions like not showing up." 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin Educators Assn. last week called for teachers to boycott open houses 
and stop assigning homework in protest of unresolved contract 
negotiations.SHANNON SANDS

YACHT WAS TRASHED BUT CLEAN OF DRUGS

No evidence of drugs was found aboard an 87-foot motor yacht from Newport Beach 
that was seized over the weekend by Mexican agents who destroyed the vessel's 
interior during a two-day hunt for narcotics, U.S. Customs Service officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a thorough search, Customs agents and Coast Guard officers combed the 
Rusalka for almost four hours after the craft's arrival in Key West, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
They also questioned the skipper, Robert Ambrosius, 27, of Orange, and his 
wife, Tammy, 21. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the yacht say the vessel was boarded by more than 30 Mexican 
agents after it anchored Saturday in waters near the island port of Cozumel, a 
popular resort on the Yucatan Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
According to accounts of the incident, Mexican authorities said they suspected 
that drugs were aboard the Rusalka and proceeded to destroy the interior of the 
yacht with sledgehammers and crowbars. Silk upholstery, hand-woven carpets, 
teak bulkheads and marble fixtures were ruined in the search. 
</P>
<P>
No drugs were found by Mexican police, the owners said, but two crewmen were 
arrested and removed from the Rusalka before the skipper and his wife could 
raise anchor and flee to Key West. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Coast Guard and Customs did an extensive and thorough search of the 
boat and found nothing," said Michael Sheehan, a Customs Service spokesman. 
"Everything seems legit." 
</P>
<P>
Igor Olenicoff, an Irvine developer who bought the boat three years ago for 
pleasure, has requested that the U.S. Department of State protest the seizure. 
He also is considering a federal lawsuit against Mexican authorities, alleging 
that the search was an act of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Olenicoff said Thursday that the two crewmen, Polo Herrera of Panama and 
Giraldo Tovar de Jesus of Colombia, remained jailed in Cozumel. According to 
Ambrosius, both men were beaten by Mexican agents. DAN WEIKEL

The County Fire Department is cautioning the public against phone solicitors 
misrepresenting themselves as firefighters asking for donations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fire Department is receiving between 15 and 20 calls a day with complaints 
or queries about the solicitations," spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
She said solicitors have been "abusive, rude and suspicious in nature." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Burn Assn. currently is the only legitimate charity using 
solicitors to advertise the department's benefit magic show scheduled May 30 in 
the Anaheim Convention Center, she said.

JURY CAN HEAR BROWN'S ALLEGED JAILHOUSE MURDER PLOT; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: JUDGE'S RULING TO ADMIT TAPE-RECORDED CONVERSATIONS IS A MAJOR BLOW TO 
THE DEFENSE OF MAN ACCUSED IN THE 1985 SLAYING OF HIS WIFE.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a critical blow to murder defendant David Arnold Brown, a judge decided 
Thursday that a jury can hear about the Anaheim Hills man's alleged jailhouse 
plot to hire a hit man to kill three key figures in his prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Pohlson, the attorney defending Brown on charges that he orchestrated his 
wife's 1985 murder and pinned it on his own daughter, said the ruling makes his 
job "an almost impossible task." 
</P>
<P>
As part of yet another failed attempt to get evidence thrown out of court, 
Brown took the witness stand for the first time in his 19 months of legal 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 37, claimed he "wasn't really aware of what was going on" when he agreed 
to talk with police without an attorney present shortly after his Sept. 22, 
1988, arrest. Brown said he had gotten very little sleep and was under the 
influence of medication at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin called the police interview "about 
as voluntary and free as it could be." 
</P>
<P>
In the police tape, played at Brown's preliminary hearing last year, he denied 
having orchestrated the shooting of his wife, Linda, as she slept in their 
Garden Grove home on March 19, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But he did acknowledge telling his daughter, Cinnamon, that she should take the 
blame for the killing -- because her youth would preclude a long prison 
sentence -- and showing her how to write a suicide note and concoct a drug 
mixture to feign suicide after the killing. Cinnamon, convicted in the murder, 
remains in prison and is now a key witness against her father. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the hearing, Pohlson pleaded with McCartin to throw out of court a 
series of tape-recorded phone conversations from early 1989 between Brown and 
another former jail inmate detailing their alleged plans to kill Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson, Investigator Jay Newell and Brown's current wife, 
Patti Bailey -- another key witness against him. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, the victim's sister, married Brown after Linda Brown's murder and the 
pair lived in Anaheim for more than three years after the killing -- in part by 
means of $835,000 they had collected from Linda Brown's insurance -- until 
Cinnamon recanted her story in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Pohlson told McCartin the jailhouse plot only showed that Brown was scared -- 
not that he had killed his wife -- and that no jury would believe him innocent 
after hearing about the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly can't conceive of a more damaging piece of evidence to come into a 
case," Pohlson said. "If this comes in, we roll over -- the jury's going to 
roll over us." 
</P>
<P>
The judge conceded it was damaging and added: "It's relevant. . . . I don't see 
any way I could rule it out unless I lost my sanity." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers will begin picking a jury for the case on Monday and trial will start 
the next week. If convicted, Brown could face life in prison without the 
possibility of parole -- but not the death penalty.

CELEBRATION'S A SAILING POINT IN RACE;

<P>
BOATING: THE PARTY SPIRIT IS ALREADY ABOARD TODAY'S 43RD ANNUAL NEWPORT TO 
ENSENADA INTERNATIONAL YACHT RACE.

The boats are double-parked in the water outside two of Newport's biggest yacht 
clubs. From the ropes and riggings fly the brightly colored signal flags of 
sailing clubs up and down the coast of California. 
</P>
<P>
At noon today, with weather expected to be breezy and clear, the 43rd annual 
Newport to Ensenada International Yacht Race will get under way. Sailors from 
all over the United States and Mexico congregate here for this race. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people, ranging in age from 16 to over 70, will participate, 
including both novices and sailors as well known as America's Cup winner Dennis 
Connors. On Thursday afternoon, the harbor was already crowded with people 
preparing their sloops, catamarans and schooners for the 126-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Spencer was making last-minute checks of the riggings on his boat, the 
Blue Star. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just fine-tuning things today," Spencer explained, adding that although 
his crew sails a lot of club races, this is one of its few overnight races. 
"For us it's going to be very competitive. . . . We're here because of the 
event of it all, and the chance to see what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Coker, who placed first last year in his boat class, is also hoping to do 
well, skippering the 27-foot Windbreaker. But luck, he says, is the biggest 
factor in the race, which takes the boats along the coast of Southern 
California, past the Coronado Islands to the Mexican town of Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
"Today they're concentrating on getting their bottoms in shape and getting the 
rigs tuned properly," Coker said, gesturing to the crews on neighboring boats. 
"And the party tonight is going to be another thing to concentrate on." 
</P>
<P>
"At this race, there's something for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m. Thursday, race festivities were already under way at the yacht clubs. 
</P>
<P>
For John Abernatha, who was trying to find a mooring for his 30-foot boat 
called the Bad Company, the Newport race is the perfect opportunity to make 
racing fun. He said he and his family are looking forward to "the whole party 
thing" and have taken off a week from work so they can stay in Mexico and surf. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a pretty serious race crew, but this is really like a vacation for us," 
Abernatha said. 
</P>
<P>
Another group that takes the racing more lightly are the Prospectors, a group 
of attorneys and businessmen out of San Francisco. Over the 15 years they've 
been racing the Ensenada, Commodore John Roveda said, the Prospectors have come 
up with a number of stunts to liven up the race. One year they hired a string 
quartet to serenade them down the coast. The group also boasts the best meals 
on a ship, from rack of lamb to filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
"The crew must eat well, or we can't get the high-quality people -- people who 
don't care if the win or not," Roveda said with a grin.

49ER FAN LOSES CASE AGAINST ANAHEIM POLICE, GETS SCOLDING

<P>
A federal appeals court Thursday rejected the claims of a San Francisco 49er 
fan that Anaheim police used excessive force -- a finger hold -- to roust him 
from a rowdy confrontation during a 1984 Rams-49ers game. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the three judges of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told 49er 
fan Robert Kiser that the Anaheim officers "are to be commended for their 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
Kiser, his wife, Claudia, and their friends Peter and Marlene Eberle were 
accused of being "belligerent, using foul language and making rude hand 
gestures" as they sat in the midst of Rams fans at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After police were called to defuse the situation, Claudia Kiser pushed one 
officer, Marlene Eberle threw a beer on another and shouts and jeers persisted 
from an estimated 60 to 70 Rams fans who had gathered to watch, according to 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
Kiser was escorted to a security office by an officer using a finger-hold and 
his wife and friends were brought along. 
</P>
<P>
Kiser sued Anaheim and six officers in 1986 claiming use of excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
A jury ruled in favor of the officers in a trial in Los Angeles in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson wrote that the officers "controlled and diffused a volatile situation 
which easily could have erupted into a perilous melee." The 49ers won the game, 
45-35.

I noticed the long article (April 19) about aphids devouring everything in the 
wake of malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Unless these aphids are a special breed, there is an easy and inexpensive way 
to rid one's gardens, roses and vegetables alike, of them. Simply plant a row 
of garlic alongside or ring the patch of ground with garlic and you'll get rid 
of the aphids. 
</P>
<P>
I lost a crop of broccoli to aphids, but the next season I put a ring of garlic 
around the garden and didn't have an aphid, but plenty of broccoli to eat.

PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS ALLOWED TO JOIN PUBLIC ONES IN '92; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN SECTION: SCHOOLS SUCH AS MATER DEI WILL BE ABLE TO JOIN LEAGUES THAT 
UNTIL NOW HAD INCLUDED ONLY ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

<P>
The Southern Section's general council approved a proposal Thursday that would 
allow its member schools to join any geographic area for the purpose of placing 
them into athletic leagues beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Private and parochial high schools will be allowed to request membership in any 
Southern Section geographic area, meaning parochial high schools such as Santa 
Margarita, Mater Dei and Servite would be allowed to join leagues that until 
now had included only Orange County public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Public schools in Orange County now are grouped in leagues with other Orange 
County public schools; private and parochial high schools in Orange County are 
grouped with schools outside Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the county's 54 public high school principals at Thursday's meeting 
opposed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The door is now open so that parochial schools can go into any geographic 
area," said William Brand, principal at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"A school like Servite, which is essentially on the border of Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, can pick and choose where it wants to play. Shouldn't other 
schools have some control or say over their destiny?" 
</P>
<P>
William Brelsford, principal of St. Bernard High School and president of the 
Catholic Athletic Assn., applauded the decision. "The opposition of this whole 
issue is based on the objections of one area in the Southern Section, Orange 
County," Brelsford said. 
</P>
<P>
"On a whim, that area has been allowed to exclude one school (Santa Margarita) 
from being placed into its area. How can one area dictate to the CIF (Southern 
Section)?" 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita, which lost a series of appeals to join the Orange County 
geographic area last year, will request placement into the county area 
beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at Mater Dei and Servite said they are uncertain about their 
future league placements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easy decision for Santa Margarita, but at this point, it's a bit 
premature to speak for Mater Dei," said John Weling, the school's principal. 
"When you consider transportation costs and missed class time our students 
incur playing in a Catholic league, today's decision is encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Council Notes 
</P>
<P>
Football teams in the South Coast and Pacific Coast leagues will be competing 
in higher playoff divisions beginning next season. South Coast League members 
move from Division III to Division II and Pacific Coast League members move 
from Division VIII to Division VII. The Pacific Coast League's move means there 
are six leagues in Division VII and each league will be guaranteed only two 
entries in the playoffs.

S&amp;L FACES HUGE LOSSES ON KOLL CO. DEALS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: COLUMBIA SAYS JOINT VENTURE'S OFFICE BUILDINGS ARE ONLY HALF FULL AND 
IT NEEDS TO SELL ITS INTEREST TO RAISE CAPITAL. 
</P>

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When one of the nation's largest and most profitable thrifts teamed up with the 
biggest developer on the West Coast to construct office buildings in the early 
1980s, it probably seemed a very good idea indeed. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the two companies had a lot more in common than fashionable 
addresses. Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., based in Beverly Hills, had lots 
of money to invest. And the Koll Co. of Newport Beach had years of experience 
building offices, factories and warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before the junk bond market crashed in 1989, forcing Columbia to 
report huge losses. It was also before the office market started going downhill 
in Orange County, which also began in earnest last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now Columbia has told the Securities and Exchange Commission that the office 
towers it built in 1988 with Koll in Irvine and Orange are still half empty. 
The thrift has been forced to sink more cash into them to keep them operating 
and now needs to sell its interest in the buildings to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. The remaining land Koll and Columbia own in Irvine may not 
be worth nearly as much as the two had thought, since the city may not allow 
them to construct as many buildings as planned. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filing did not indicate the percentage of the Koll buildings that 
Columbia owns, making it difficult to determine its potential losses on the 
structures. But Columbia told the SEC it has put aside $49 million to cover 
potential losses on its real estate investments. And sources said as much as 
$30 million of that amount has been set aside for the Koll buildings, some of 
it to cover continuing operating expenses but most of it in anticipation of 
losses when the thrift sells its interest in the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's recent filings with the SEC also provide an interesting glimpse at 
how the market downturn has affected the intensely private Koll Co. Officials 
of the firm did not respond to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia told the SEC that its two 12-story office towers at Koll Center Irvine 
North near John Wayne Airport -- which opened in 1988 -- were only 56% leased 
by the end of last year. (Until recently, developers expected to fill new 
office buildings within a year.) The problem was even worse at Koll Center 
Orange, where an office tower constructed in 1988 was only 47% occupied. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County alone, one-fifth of the nearly 50 million square feet of space 
in larger, newer office buildings is empty, commercial broker Coldwell Banker 
reported recently. Even though tenants took nearly a million square feet of 
office space off the market during the first quarter of the year -- a very 
healthy amount -- there's still lots more space out there and rents remain 
flat. And while construction has slowed, there's still plenty more office space 
coming out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
According to the SEC filing, the city of Irvine is pondering how much more 
development to allow around John Wayne Airport, including the remaining land at 
Koll Center Irvine North owned by Columbia and Koll. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city makes up its mind whether to allow Koll to build three more 
office towers and other buildings on the land, "the liquidity and marketability 
of this investment will be substantially impaired," Columbia told the SEC. And 
if the city imposes new conditions or restrictions on the project, "the market 
value of this investment is likely to decline substantially." 
</P>
<P>
Those buildings and the land make up about a third of Columbia's real estate 
portfolio, for an investment of about $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
Just how serious is all this? The $62 million that Columbia lost last year on 
its real estate investments is dwarfed by the more than $500 million it lost in 
the last five months. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate, in fact, wasn't the cause of Columbia's problems, as it was for a 
lot of thrifts. What hurt Columbia was its $3.5-billion junk bond portfolio, 
which plummeted in value when the market for the risky, high-yield bonds 
dropped last year. 
</P>
<P>
The losses wiped out its capital; the thrift acknowledged in another SEC filing 
Thursday that it might be seized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
But what to do with the real estate remains a persistent problem: Columbia is 
under pressure from new federal thrift regulations to sell its real estate by 
1994. If the market doesn't improve soon, it will be hard for the thrift to get 
top dollar. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Columbia told the SEC, there is no assurance "the association will 
recover its investments with respect to any of these projects." 
</P>
<P>
For Koll, the problems aren't as serious. The giant developer has amassed 
billions of dollars in real estate holdings and isn't likely to be affected 
much by taking on a new partner when Columbia sells its interest in Koll Center 
Irvine North and Koll Center Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Koll has already had several other partners bail out of the high vacancy rates 
and low rents of the Orange County market by selling their interests in 
buildings. In fact, the big developer is rumored to have a partner already 
lined up for the Columbia buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Koll still faces an office market that is overbuilt. Even while the stream of 
tenants looking for office space remains steady, there is still way too much 
space to fill. 
</P>
<P>
And with the thrifts out of the action thanks to the new federal regulations, 
experts say it's getting harder to find financing for real estate deals, even 
for such big players as Koll. 
</P>
<P>
One of Koll's biggest deals, in fact, recently fell through when Union Pacific 
Corp. said the developer did not come up with adequate financing to complete 
the $532-million acquisition of the railroad's massive landholdings.

BE WARY OF EC LURES, FIRMS ADVISED; 
</P>
<P>
INCENTIVES: THE DANISH CONSUL-GENERAL SAYS U.S. FIRMS EXPANDING IN EUROPE 
SHOULD FOCUS ON FACTORS OTHER THAN LOW TAXES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INDUCEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

U.S. companies considering setting up operations in the European Community 
should not base their decisions on low tax rates or other financial incentives 
offered by different nations because these "baits" can give a false picture of 
the market's competitive nature, a Danish diplomat said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, U.S. companies should focus on their future expansion plans in the 
European Community and match their technical and managerial needs with those 
currently available in the 12-nation trade bloc, Danish Consul General Henning 
Kristiansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. companies that have set up operations in Western Europe have later 
moved to other countries after discovering that "when the incentives disappear, 
they couldn't compete in the European marketplace," Kristiansen said in an 
interview after a speech to the Orange County Chamber of Commerce in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With plans to integrate most of the EC economies in 1992, Kristiansen said 
companies will have to move fast to capitalize on market opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Beside tax breaks, other incentives being offered by some European nations 
include research, relocation and training grants, and low-interest, long-term 
loans. The Danish government has jumped in with incentives of its own. Earlier 
this year, Denmark lowered its corporate tax rate from 50% to 40%, said 
Kristiansen, who represents Denmark's interests in 11 western states, Alaska 
and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Although Denmark offers fewer financial incentives than other EC countries -- 
Ireland, for example, has a 10% corporate tax rate -- Kristiansen said such 
inducements aren't the only way to lure foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Companies should not be blinded by financial incentives offered by countries, 
he said, because other factors such as training an unskilled work force could 
cost a company more in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign companies who obtain incentives will get a false picture of the real 
competitive situation in the market because, as the incentives are slowly 
lifted, the real market situation will surface," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high start-up cost for foreign companies, Denmark has been able to 
entice more than 230 U.S. companies to establish subsidiaries in the country. 
Last year, International Business Machines Corp., which is the largest U.S. 
company operating in Denmark, located its European, Middle Eastern and African 
software distribution operations in a suburb of Copenhagen.

AIRPORT ARTS BUDGET OF $125,000 RECOMMENDED BY ADVISORY PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBITS: THE AMOUNT IS ONE-HALF THAT ENVISIONED BY A TASK FORCE THAT DESIGNED 
THE PROGRAM, BUT KEY ASPECTS WOULD BE KEPT.

<P>
An advisory commission for an arts program at the new John Wayne Airport 
terminal in Irvine has recommended a program budget of $125,000 for fiscal 
1990-91. The spending plan will be reviewed by airport staff and then submitted 
to the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Funding would come from the airport "enterprise fund," generated through fees 
charged airlines and other airport users. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended amount is half that suggested by a task force that helped 
design the arts program, which was approved in concept by the supervisors in 
January. The supervisors are expected to act on the budget this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal includes funds for four rotating exhibits and a curator for 
each exhibit, key components of the program as envisioned by the task force. 
But it also reflects a commission decision to employ an airport staff member 
part time as director of the program, rather than a full-time arts 
administrator with five years' experience, as the task force recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"Art expertise (for the program) will be coming from the commission and 
consultants or curators," so a full-time administrator won't be required, said 
Courtney Wiercioch, an airport staff analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Also trimmed from the task force recommendations was funding for public 
relations, work that Wiercioch said the airport staff will assume. 
</P>
<P>
Further costs were cut as "the commissioners realized that they would rather 
have small-scale exhibits of high quality than some incredibly complex and 
(logistically) difficult exhibit," Wiercioch said. "This is a fledgling 
program, and the commissioners want to start out small." 
</P>
<P>
Wiercioch said the five-member commission hasn't yet decided whether the 
program should involve acquisition of permanent artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors in January approved $40,000 to be used for an inaugural exhibit 
featuring Orange County artists during dedication ceremonies at the new 
passenger terminal Sept. 7 and 8.

The Southern California Restaurant Writers named Karel Vidlak of the Wine 
Cellar at the Hyatt Newporter in Newport Beach maitre d' of the year at its 
awards banquet in Costa Mesa on Sunday. Meanwhile, five Orange County dining 
spots received Golden Scepter awards: the Towers at the Surf and Sand Hotel, 
Laguna Beach; the Cellar in Fullerton; Antoine at Le Meridien in Newport Beach, 
J.W.'s at the Marriott Hotel in Anaheim and Antonello in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Bacchus winners, for superb wine lists and service, were the Bouzy Rouge in 
Newport Beach; the Cellar in Fullerton (again!), the Five Crowns in Corona del 
Mar and Mr. Stox in Anaheim. The banquet was held at the Westin South Coast 
Plaza. The awards recognize restaurants from Santa Barbara to the Mexican

</P>
<P>
CHEZ LIVES! Though Chez Cary in Orange closed Saturday after 27 years, 
expertise gained from working at the Chez still lives all through the county. 
Alumni include James Conway, now maitre d' at J.W.'s in Anaheim; Sean Lewis, 
manager of the Cellar in Fullerton; Peter Jepsen, now with Hans Prager at the 
Ritz in Newport Beach; John Pohl, director of catering at the Red Lion in Costa

of Chez Cary, puts it: "It was the Scandia of Orange County! Everyone came 
through the Chez." 
</P>
<P>
SPREADING OUT: Open less than a month, Rumari in Laguna Beach is the third 
venture for the Crivello family, who also own the Ciao restaurants in Dana 
Point and Santa Ana. They've taken the old Villa James and made it -- in the 
eyes of Vince Crivello, anyway -- more upscale, more elegant. With Vince in the 
kitchen and brother Salvatore out front, the restaurant is serving dinner 
Tuesdays through Sundays. A la carte specialties, which average about $15, 
include black linguine with seafood; braciole (roulade of beef stuffed with 
Parmesan and pine nuts) topped with pasta; and veal chop with rosemary sauce. 
(714) 494-0400. 
</P>
<P>
Be Bop Burgers celebrates its grand opening in West Park Center, Alton Parkway

</P>
<P>
A new Good Earth will open in August at the Crossroads Center, Barranca Parkway

Center are offering a pre-theater menu nightly from 4 to 7 p.m, when you can 
order four courses, plus coffee or tea, for $14.95. The regular menu also is 
available. (714) 557-8433 in Santa Ana, (714) 640-2411 in Newport Center. 
</P>
<P>
On May 15, Carmelo's in Corona del Mar will introduce a new lounge menu to be 
offered Sundays through Thursdays from 5 to 9 p.m. Antipasti will include 
carpaccio and rice croquettes. There'll be soups, pizzas, pastas and dumplings, 
such hearty fare as hot pepper steaks, and desserts. Prices will range from 
$3.50 to $8.95. (714) 675-1922. 
</P>
<P>
David Wilhelm's new Newport Harbor-view restaurant (one of three Wilhelm 
projects reported here last month), slated for July, will be named Barbacoa and 
promises island-influenced cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
CINCO DE MAYO: On May 5, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., the El Torito Grills in 
Newport Beach and Costa Mesa will serve soft tacos and margaritas for 99 cents.

<P>
"I'M GOOFY AND I'LL BE YOUR WAITER TONIGHT": Disney Character Dinners are back 
at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, as Goofy, Minnie Mouse and Chip'n'Dale 
visit tables, sign autographs and pose for photos. The dinner menu includes 
barbecue ribs and chicken, a build-your-own burger and hot dog bar, fish and 
pasta, a salad bar and desserts. The tab: $14.95 for adults and $7.25 for 
children 12 years and under. Disney Character Breakfasts are offered Saturdays 
and Sundays from 7 to 11:30 a.m. ($10.95 for adults and $6.95 for children), 
and arrangements for kids' birthday parties can be made by calling (714) 
956-6406. 
</P>
<P>
CHOCOLATE ALERT: It's chocolate all the way this weekend at Le Meridien in 
Newport Beach. Stay overnight Saturday and you'll be invited to seminars that 
afternoon where 16 pastry chefs will teach you to make truffles, chocolate 
tortes and chocolate souffles; a Decadent Chocolate and Champagne Reception on 
Saturday evening and, on Sunday, a complimentary chocolate souffle brunch where 
you can watch the chefs' "best truffle" competition. The weekend (8 p.m. Sunday 
checkout) is $168 per couple plus tax. Reservations: (714) 476-2001. 
</P>
<P>
LEAVING TOWN: After looking for two years for a new site in Orange County, 
Sharon and Grant Showley of Showley-Wrightson will leave Newport Beach around 
June 1 for Napa Valley, where they've bought the landmark Miramonte restaurant 
in St. Helena. Two former Showley-Wrightson employees, Dona Wnuk and John 
Riley, are negotiating to take the old place over.

3-6-9 SHANGHAI IN ANAHEIM IS FULL OF CHINESE FLAVOR

<P>
A good number of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Southern California 
can be found in the San Gabriel Valley. Now, at long last, a little bit of the 
San Gabriel Valley has surfaced in Orange County: 3-6-9 Shanghai, one of that 
area's best Chinese restaurants, has opened a branch in an Anaheim shopping 
mall. Along for the ride are nearly all the wonderful cold dishes, handmade 
breads and savory dumplings that made the original restaurant such a hit. 
</P>
<P>
3-6-9 Shanghai makes no attempt to be Western. It is your basic, brightly lit, 
Formica table-top, Chinese-style roadhouse cafe. Lily Liu, 3-6-9's owner, is 
from Taiwan, but both her mother and father were born in Shanghai. Liu learned 
to cook at an early age, and many of the dishes on her menu are family recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her customers zero in on those wonderful breads and dumplings. And 
inside the glass deli case are several cold dishes -- exotically spiced meats 
and vegetables -- which Shanghai cuisine is noted for. Perhaps the best known 
is wine-marinated chicken. 3-6-9's version is mild and flavorful, one of the 
easiest dishes to eat I know of. 
</P>
<P>
Other options include Liu's pomfret fish, which she smokes with tea leaves and 
sugar. The result is a grainy, slightly sweet fish -- much different than the 
saltier smoked fish with which most Western palates are familiar. Liu also 
smokes chicken, using a strongly flavored dry-textured preparation that I found 
almost overbearing. Cold-pickled vegetables -- cucumber with red chile or 
oil-soaked braised baby bamboo shoots, for example -- make good accompaniments 
for the meat dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The dumplings, 10 to an order, make an ideal second course. Indeed, 3-6-9's 
Shanghai steamed dumplings, fat little pockets of dough that burst with juice 
when you bite into them, are among the most irresistible dishes I have ever run 
across. The filling, minced pork with spices, is soft and dense. Dip the 
dumplings in rice vinegar and hot chile oil, then eat them with sliced fresh 
ginger. 
</P>
<P>
Boiled chive dumplings are another terrific variation, perfect for vegetarians. 
The green-tinged, diaphanous pouches are filled with eggs, chives and 
watercress. 
</P>
<P>
Among the breads is something called fried sesame roll, actually a pan-fried 
onion bread studded with white sesame. It's wonderful. Then there is the 
million-layers cake, which the waitress will tell you is "Chinese pizza." It 
looks like a cinnamon roll without the frosting, and you pull the layers out 
from the middle as you eat it. It's an oily, simple bread that goes perfectly 
well with the restaurant's vinegary, meat-rich hot-and-sour soup. 
</P>
<P>
There are several hot pots and noodle dishes. These don't show off the 
restaurant's best cooking, but they are generally fresh, honest and 
well-prepared. The best is steamed pork with rice powder -- lean, tiny smoked 
pork ribs coated in pulverized rice, braised and served atop a bed of steamed 
pumpkin. The dish, outrageously cheap at $2.95, is served in a bamboo steamer. 
</P>
<P>
I would also try to squeeze in some smoked pork with green garlic (the "green 
garlic" turns out to be leek, a veritable mountain of it, in fact). 
</P>
<P>
The roast catfish with garlic is delicious. But the infamous surimi, 
artificially flavored pollock, is substituted for crab in the otherwise 
appealing seafood soup. And fish head casserole, normally a staple in Chinese 
kitchens, was so oily I couldn't eat it. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a problem with monosodium glutamate (MSG) at this restaurant. The 
kitchen here seems to use it liberally in the cooked dishes. Ask them not to. 
That's the one aspect of authenticity most of us can do without. 
</P>
<P>
3-6-9 Shanghai is inexpensive. Dim sum and dumplings are 50 cents to $4.25. 
Soups are $3.25 to $4.25. Cold dishes are $2.95. A la carte entrees are $4.95 
to $9.95.

THANK YOU FOR NOT BASHING CHRISTIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo! Bravo! There's been so many nasty things said recently about religion, 
Christianity in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Some deserved, some not deserved. I was pleasantly shocked by Susan Christian's 
piece "The Last Temptation" (April 5). It was good, fair journalism. No 
Christian bashing. I almost fainted. 
</P>
<P>
I, for one, am glad the Church is offering these services to the gay community. 
After all, it's terribly convenient to donate a few bucks to the (AIDS) cause, 
sit back, put your feet up and blame God by assuming that homosexuals don't 
want any help . . . and couldn't change even if they did. Some folks call it a 
cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks again (Susan and The Times), and give us more.

FRED PLUMER'S ROLE IN MEASURE N CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special thanks to you for the column "Measure N Seemed to Seek Out Fred 
Plumer" (Joe Bell, April 12). As one who worked on the Irvine Citizens United 
campaign to defeat Measure N (too bad we weren't successful), I can personally 
testify to the special role that Fred played throughout the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
He was always there to calm our frustrations, lift our spirits, and urge us on 
to do what we knew in our hearts was right. 
</P>
<P>
Fred is a most unusual person. His infectious personality, genuine openness and 
faith in humankind seem to energize his friends and followers and to disarm 
even his avowed enemies. Spend a few minutes in his company and you sense 
immediately that he really does believe in the worth and dignity of every 
individual. What a contrast to the Lou Sheldon's of this world. Sheldon could 
learn a lot from Fred Plumer, not the least of which is the true meaning of 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bell, thanks, too, for being such a refreshing breath of reason, compassion 
and tolerance. Sometimes I think that there must be something wrong with me -- 
I agree with just about every point you make in every column you write! Just 
like the Orange County Register. Right.

SMALL MISTAKE SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your premise that a black golfer, Roy, was mistaken for a car wash attendant 
(Family Life Column by Mike Spencer, April 5) because of some stereotyping 
plants the idea that blacks can suspect that all slights by people of other 
races are racially motivated. Wrong. People of all colors can be insensitive 
and oblivious to the feelings of others on any given day. Furthermore, being 
mistaken for someone working should not be a personal affront. Since our 
lifestyles and attire are so casual, it is frequently difficult to distinguish 
the servers from the served. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-working, clean, pleasant, young people who work in our car wash in 
Laguna Hills are part of the self-supporting, taxpaying sector of our society. 
My husband and sons often man the gas pumps and vacuum and move cars, while my 
daughter has spent many hours at the cash register. Would you be offended to be 
mistaken for the owner of a multimillion-dollar establishment or just his 
employee? Would you know the difference? 
</P>
<P>
To deny that racism exists is to deny truth. To attribute small slights, 
misunderstandings, unkindness and rudeness to racism fosters unhealthy paranoid 
attitudes in the minds of the recipients of such incidents. Most of these 
occurrences are as impersonal as being cut off by a truck on the freeway. 
</P>

Roy was a victim of a racial slight only if he allowed himself to think he was. 
How insignificant the event was, and if that was the worst thing that happened 
to him, he had a pretty good day. He handled the situation correctly while you, 
on the other hand, would have created a potentially chaotic situation, and the 
business people trying to accommodate you would have born the brunt. 
</P>
<P>
Your effort to teach us to be sensitive to racial differences was made at the 
expense of people who do not measure up to your standard of social equality. 
There is more than one kind of discrimination. You are making class 
distinctions to create your own "pecking order" and sense of worth. You would 
be more constructive (and democratic) to advocate that we respect all others, 
regardless of race or job status. 
</P>
<P>
No one likes to be snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
We all behave better if we're appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you can be more aware of your own obvious propensity toward class 
consciousness and how that can lead to rude, overly aggressive behavior.

HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
SCOUTS: MORE THAN JUST SELLING COOKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAWN STONE, Dawn Stone is a senior at El Toro High School, where she is 
editor of the student news magazine, The BullETin, Keywanette treasurer and a 
member of the Academic Decathlon team. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the fourth grade, almost half the students in my class proudly wore 
either navy-blue Cub Scout uniforms or patch-laden Girl Scout sashes. 
</P>
<P>
But some time during junior high, many of these same kids began to think the 
uniforms looked too uncool, and scouting became a social liability. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure from friends and busy schedules crowded out scouting for most. Yet 
those who stayed involved say the drawbacks are minimal compared to the 
rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Richa Varma, 14, a freshman at El Toro High School, quit Girl Scouts after the 
sixth grade but decided to rejoin this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed it," she said. "There was so much to do, and it was so interesting. I 
love camping. You meet new people, and I just enjoyed it a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first joined (again), I didn't tell anybody. But as soon as I started 
selling Girl Scout cookies at school, people would say, 'You're still a Girl 
Scout?' There are some people out there who are like, 'You're in Girl Scouts! 
Get away! Don't be such a baby.' But it's something I like to do, and if they 
can't accept that, that's their problem." 
</P>
<P>
Karin Carlson, director of program services for the Girl Scout Council of 
Orange County, said: "If they can tough out the peer pressure, there are so 
many opportunities that open up to them for leadership, for service, for 
travel." 
</P>
<P>
High school students in scouting, called seniors, do more than go camping and 
sell cookies. Scouting combines community service with training in such diverse 
areas as surfing, cooking and career planning. Similarly to the younger Scouts 
who earn badges for activities, senior Scouts participate in special projects 
to earn patches that show they have mastered certain skills. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Boy Scouts work toward achieving Eagle status, the highest honor in 
scouting, while senior girls aim for the Eagle's equivalent, the Gold Award. 
</P>
<P>
To earn the rank of Eagle, a Boy Scout must plan and organize a 100-hour 
service project. David Jedynak, 18, a Mission Viejo High senior, expects to 
earn his Eagle honor next month after setting up a project to resurrect a dying 
trail in Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Jeeps roamed the Trabuco Canyon Trail 25 years ago, but weather and plants 
eroded the path, making it almost too narrow in places to walk. For his 
project, Jedynak and his fellow Scouts cleared trees, moved rocks and chopped 
down plants to make it a usable foot trail again. 
</P>
<P>
Scouting has also allowed Jedynak to backpack in the sand dunes along the 
California-Arizona border, where the third movie of the Star Wars trilogy, 
"Return of the Jedi," was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
On one rock-climbing trip that placed the Scouts in a 300-foot vertical cave, 
Jedynak had a chance to practice rescue techniques when one of the climbers 
fell. With his troop, he has also canoed 14 miles in Mission Bay in San Diego, 
helped with a local children's Easter egg hunt and collected food and shoes for 
children in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Jedynak said that besides the satisfaction he has gained by serving his 
community, he has experienced personal rewards. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he was named Orange County's outstanding senior patrol leader for his 
commitment to planning and organizing his troop's activities. As a result, 
Orange County developer William Lyon invited him to lead the flag salute at a 
$5,000-a-plate charity dinner at a country club in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
Jedynak is near the top of scouting, and he has had to face the negative 
reactions of others all along the way. Peer pressure was greatest in junior 
high school, he said, although he adds it was never particularly troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't bother me because I was proud of what I was doing," he said. "I was 
a leader, and I did get chosen to go to this fancy lunch at this very, very 
fancy country club. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts a little bit when you see people (putting down scouting). The biggest 
way that it hurts is they don't know what they're talking about. They haven't 
been in Scouts, and they're missing things. It's like, 'You wouldn't say that 
if only you knew what it was like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Maarten VanGestel, a 14-year-old freshman at El Toro High, agreed: "Some people 
do have that attitude, but then I tell them what we do, and they don't say 
anything anymore. They've never climbed Mt. Whitney, gone rock climbing or 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
VanGestel, who has climbed Mt. Whitney, has also camped in the Sierra Nevada, 
learned first aid and become a certified lifeguard through scouting. He used 
his lifeguarding skills at a wheelchair sports camp at Saddleback College last 
spring vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouting has helped me learn leadership, and I've made a lot of friends 
through scouting," VanGestel said. 
</P>
<P>
Girl Scouts "is like a whole different set of friendships," said Cheri Keller, 
a 16-year-old junior at Mission Viejo High. "We're all really close, and it's 
like a second family." 
</P>
<P>
Through scouting, Keller said, she has participated in several service 
projects, such as working with the Red Cross to assemble friendship kits -- 
shampoo, conditioner and hairbrushes -- for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you self-confidence and makes you more aware of what's going on in 
the community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Between community service, interest projects for patches and camping trips, 
scouting can sometimes interfere with school activities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of competition out there from school activities and all," the 
Girl Scout Council's Carlson said, "but the girls we get are usually involved 
in sports or honor society or something else, and they have learned to juggle 
all of that." 
</P>
<P>
This year, a senior scouting event in Newport Harbor that will instruct girls 
in maritime skills such as rigging and Morse Code will be held on the weekend 
of El Toro's prom. 
</P>
<P>
Often, El Toro High's Varma said, Scouts "have to choose between Girl Scouts 
and something else." 
</P>
<P>
Varma, who originally left scouting because she anticipated a busier schedule 
in junior high, said: "My parents were happy when I dropped out. They thought I 
was taking too much on. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I wish I wasn't in (Scouts) so I could do other things, 
but I think it's worth it. To be really committed to Girl Scouts is just 
something that makes me feel good about myself." 
</P>
<P>
Jason Miller, 16, a sophomore at El Toro High, said scouting has helped build 
his self-image. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that I can do a lot more than I thought I could do," he said. "I 
never thought I could hang on the side of a cliff face while rock climbing, but 
I've done that in scouting. And I never thought I'd get used to leading people, 
but I've done that in scouting." 
</P>
<P>
Added Jedynak: "I learned things about myself, things about leadership, how to 
deal with people, dealing with the public, all these different skills that 
there would have been no chance for me to get anywhere else. I couldn't have 
gotten it from varsity sports or marching band or anything like that.

BUENA PARK MAN KILLED BY TRAIN

<P>
A Buena Park man who was sitting on railroad tracks with a friend was killed 
after he refused to heed a train's warning to clear the tracks, Fullerton 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Charles Peterson, 43, died around 11 p.m. Thursday when a Santa Fe 
Railroad freight train knocked him off the tracks in the 1800 block of West 
Commonwealth Avenue, Fullerton Sgt. Joe Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's companion, 32-year-old Wesley Park of Long Beach, escaped injuries 
when he scampered away, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said the conductor reported seeing two men sitting on the tracks as the 
train traveled between a small commercial complex at a speed of 45 m.p.h.. 
</P>
<P>
Park scampered off the tracks after the train's horn was sounded. The engineer 
told investigators that he braked but could not avoid slamming into Peterson, 
Klein said . 
</P>
<P>
The Buena Park man was struck in his face and was later pronounced dead from 
massive head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said investigators do not suspect foul play in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Park, who was arrested on the scene for public drunkenness, was released on his 
own recognizance this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said an autopsy would seek to determine whether Peterson also was 
intoxicated.

2 KILLED IN SPORTS CAR CRASH

<P>
Two men were killed this morning when the speeding Corvette they were in 
crashed through a concrete barrier on an elevated section of the Golden State 
Freeway and plummeted 100 feet to a field below, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The car shot off of there like a rocket," CHP Officer Dave Grajeda said of the 
2:40 a.m. accident on the curving transition road from the northbound Golden 
State Freeway to the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The car flew out 90 feet and then down 100," Grajeda said. "Both occupants 
weren't wearing seat belts and were ejected. The passenger landed on top of the 
driver and the car landed on top of them." 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Corvette was driven by a 37-year-old Los Angeles man whose name was 
not released pending notification of his family. The driver died shortly after 
the accident at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. The passenger, who 
had no identification, died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Grajeda said there were no witnesses to the accident but the investigation 
showed that the car was going faster than 100 m.p.h. when the driver attempted 
to take the curve onto the Simi Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"That is way too fast for that curve," Grajeda said. "He lost control and 
crashed through the barrier. Fortunately, it was open space below. No homes." 
</P>
<P>
Grajeda said investigators detected the odor of alcohol at the crash site but 
will have to await autopsy results to determine if the driver had been 
drinking.

MOTHER CRAWLS OUT IN CAR PLUNGE

An injured Palmdale woman crawled up a 300-foot embankment with her 4-month-old 
son and flagged down help after her car had crashed off of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway near Agua Dulce, the California Highway Patrol reported this morning. 
</P>
<P>
After Maria Guadalupe Acevedo, 23, got assistance after the 10:30 p.m. accident 
Thursday, firefighters descended the embankment to rescue her boyfriend who was 
trapped in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Acevedo and her boyfriend, Felipe Cueva, 26, suffered moderate injuries in the 
accident. Their infant son, Felipe Antonia Cueva, had minor injuries. All three 
were being treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer A. J. Torres said the accident occurred when Acevedo attempted to 
get out of the way of a car rapidly approaching from behind. When the driver 
behind flashed high beams, Acevedo moved from the center lane to the fast lane 
but realized the rear car had done the same thing. When she switched back to 
the second lane she realized she had just cut off another fast-moving car. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said Acevedo swerved into the slow lane to avoid the second car but then 
lost control. She crossed the exit lane at Escondido Canyon Road and went off 
the roadway down the embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said neither of the other cars stopped. After Acevedo, who had deep cuts 
in her legs and other bruises and cuts, managed to climb up the steep 
embankment while holding her son, motorist Mike Watson of Acton, spotted her 
and stopped.

TRUMP SAYS HE'D SELL IT ALL; 
</P>
<P>
HE DENIES HIS EMPIRE IS IN DANGER

<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Trump, whose acquisitions have become legendary, said today that he has 
discussed selling or refinancing virtually every major asset he owns. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, proclaiming he "wants to be the king of cash," said he is discussing 
selling the Trump Shuttle airline, and he reportedly is considering deals 
involving his Trump Tower, the Grand Hyatt in New York and his three casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, who would stand to lose a chunk of his fortune if he and his estranged 
wife, Ivana, divorce, insisted that his empire is not in danger and says he 
wants the cash so he can scoop up bargains in a sputtering real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want to do is go out and bargain hunt," he told the Wall Street 
Journal. "I want to be the king of cash." 
</P>
<P>
The casino and real estate mogul has hired Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to negotiate 
a possible sale of the Trump Shuttle less than a year after buying the carrier 
and attaching his name to it. 
</P>
<P>
"If I got the right offer, I would consider selling it," Trump told the 
Associated Press in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
When Trump acquired the carrier with bank loans from Eastern Airlines last year 
for $365 million, he said he wanted to transform it into "one of the really 
fine airlines in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Trump said he is weighing a sale because he has been approached by numerous 
parties interested in it. He declined to say whether he is making money on the 
shuttle or to identify the potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been engaged to explore strategic alternatives for the shuttle," Merrill 
Lynch spokesman Fred Yager said. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal published details of Trump's financial plans today after an 
interview with him. 
</P>
<P>
Trump denied that his empire faces any cash shortage problems, saying he has 
cash reserves of $380 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal's account said Trump was so adamant about his cash strength that he 
threatened to sue the newspaper if it suggested otherwise. Later a Trump 
spokesman said he wouldn't sue the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Among his assets are New York's Plaza Hotel, the glitzy Trump Tower skyscraper 
on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, and casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., including the 
$1-billion Taj Mahal casino, which recently opened with much fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
Trump said he is interested in raising cash today so that he will have funds on 
hand in the future to acquire additional properties. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal reported that Trump is working on refinancing his Trump Tower and 
the Grand Hyatt, and that he is considering going public with his Atlantic City 
casino-hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"Going public would be one of the easy things in life," he was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
However, Trump told the Associated Press that The Plaza and Trump Tower will 
not be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Some people in the financial community are watching for signs that Trump might 
be accumulating cash to cope with a current or anticipated cash crunch caused 
by a heavy debt load. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Trump's biggest holdings don't produce enough income to cover 
interest payments on loans taken out to pay for the acquisitions.

The unidentified man, who identified himself as an Iranian, screamed at

The assailant was hustled away by guards, along with a second man who stood 
nearby during the attack. The second man, who identified himself as Ahmed

DEFENSE CHIEF TO CONGRESS: 'BITE BULLET'; 
</P>
<P>
PENTAGON: CHENEY CHALLENGES LAWMAKERS TO MAKE HARD CHOICES IN TRIMMING BUDGET.

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney challenged his Capitol Hill critics today to end 
their "bold talk" about cutting the defense budget and come up with specifics 
for paring the nation's military in a time of reduced superpower tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking a day after he proposed sharp reductions in the B-2 stealth bomber 
production and cutbacks in other major warplane programs, Cheney said he is 
"pleased with the response" he'd received during his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
But he also had a blunt message for those lawmakers who say he's not cutting 
enough: put up or shut up. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have heard consistently from the Congress . . . is a lot of bold talk 
about wanting to take down the top line on defense. I have yet to see them 
deliver in terms of being willing to cut programs, cut bases, reduce force 
structure to achieve those levels," Cheney told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to pontificate about what the overall top line ought to be. But as 
soon as we get down to the real nitty-gritty of how we're going cut the defense 
budget . . . there's a noticeable lack of any significant, substantive plans on 
Capitol Hill," the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to respond to criticism from House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.) that his program is too modest in spending cuts, Cheney said that 
Aspin has had trouble in the past with gaining enough support in his own 
committee to support his views, let alone prevail on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
He then challenged the lawmakers to come up with, and vote on, a defense budget 
if they think they can improve on the Administration's plan. 
</P>
<P>
'If they've got a better plan, let 'em put it out there. If they've got the 
votes to change it, . . . produce them," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
But the secretary predicted that the dissension on Capitol Hill about how to 
revamp the military in such a time of sweeping change -- and during an election 
year -- means that "serious bargaining" won't begin until late this fall, and 
that a lame-duck session of Congress could be necessary before an agreement can 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's aircraft review calls for reducing the proposed number of B-2 bombers 
from 132 to 75 and reducing the proposed purchase of the C-17 long-range 
transport plane from 210 to 120. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary also called for cutting back on the Navy's A-12 attack 
aircraft and delaying purchases of the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Aircraft 
and Advanced Tactical Fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, praised 
Cheney's efforts but declined to adopt the proposed numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to commit to any specific quantities of these weapons or the 
total of annual production rates until we know the results of the testing that 
will occur now at a more orderly way," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cheney has a few more programs left to review that could produce a bit 
more in budget reductions, his tally so far is just $109 million in actual 
fiscal 1991 spending reductions and $2.4 billion in long-term spending 
authority for 1991 and beyond. The most optimistic suggestion on Capitol Hill 
for cuts that would take advantage of reduced world tensions is $6 billion in 
actual spending and about $18 billion in long-term budget authority.

A man caught in possession of secret U.S. military documents has been arrested 
on suspicion of spying for an Eastern European intelligence service, West 
German authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Baden-Wuertemberg state public prosecutor said the 35-year-old man, who was 
not identified, was arrested in a Heidelberg hotel March 26. 
</P>
<P>
He was in possession of secret documents from the U.S. military headquarters in 
Heidelberg, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who had a false passport and lived in West Germany and other West 
European countries, used the name "Dr. Bjorn-Tony Friis-Baastad" -- an Austrian 
who had nothing to do with the case, authorities said. He was said to have 
worked for an unspecified Eastern European intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said the man posed as a traveling salesman for a Danish clothing 
firm and sought out students and workers at U.S. military installations. 
</P>
<P>
He was particularly interested in NATO disarmament, the prosecutor's office 
said.

Church bells tolled, black flags fluttered in the breeze and the doors of 
Jesus' burial site were shut today for possibly the first time in 800 years as 
Christians protested a Jewish settlement in Jerusalem's Old City. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual show of unity, about 150 clergymen from nine major Christian 
sects gathered to oversee the closing of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, 
which marks the site of Jesus' crucifixion and burial. 
</P>
<P>
Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah, Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodoros I and Armenian 
Orthodox Patriarch Torkum Manoogian recited the Lord's Prayer in Arabic, 
Armenian and Greek before the massive wooden doors swung shut. 
</P>
<P>
Wajih Nusseibeh, a Muslim whose family keeps the key of the Church of the Holy 
Sepulcher, said it was the first time the doors had been closed since the 
Crusaders were driven out of the city by the Islamic warrior Saladin in the 
12th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of the Nativity, which marks the site of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, 
and holy sites throughout the country were also closed in the daylong protest. 
Church bells rang in somber, funereal cadence for about five minutes every 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
In an act of solidarity, Muslim leaders closed the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome 
of the Rock shrine to visitors. Only worshipers were permitted in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Samir Kafiti, the head of the Anglican Church in Jerusalem, told 
reporters that Christian leaders were dissatisfied with an Israeli Supreme 
Court decision to evict the 150 Jewish settlers by next Tuesday from the 
building where they are living. 
</P>
<P>
The building is in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem's old walled city. The 
Old City is on land seized by Israel during the 1967 Middle East War and is 
divided into Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Armenian quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Kafiti said the court decision Thursday was ambiguous because the judges did 
not return full control of the building to the Greek Orthodox Church, which 
owns it. The church alleges that the settlers are in the building under an 
illegal sublease. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a half-solution," Kafiti said, referring to the court's decision to 
allow 20 guards and maintenance staff to remain in the building pending a final 
ruling on the tenancy dispute. 
</P>
<P>
George Hintlian, secretary to Manoogian, said if the courts did not eventually 
rule in favor of the Greek Orthodox Church, "stronger protests will be 
considered by the heads of churches, probably longer periods of closure." 
</P>
<P>
The settlers moved into the 72-room St. John's Hospice on April 11, touching 
off angry protests from Palestinian Muslims and Christians and bringing 
international condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody leaves before Tuesday," said Benny Elon, a spokesman for the Neot David 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Associated Press, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said 
the settlers would be evicted by police if they did not leave peacefully by 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He accused Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's caretaker government of acting in an 
"underhanded" way by secretly providing $1.8 million to the settlers for the 
purchase of the lease.

Disgraced former East German leader Erich Honecker dodged photographers today 
when he was seen strolling through woods at the Soviet military hospital where 
he now lives under guard. 
</P>
<P>
Showing remarkable alertness for his 77 years, the once-feared former Communist 
Party chief and head of state spotted the cameras as he emerged from the forest 
with two uniformed Soviet army officers. 
</P>
<P>
As Honecker ducked behind a tree and poked his head around the trunk, one of 
the officers escorted the photographers away from the grounds of the hospital, 
a military sanatorium near Potsdam.

Revco D.S. Inc. announced today that it has agreed to sell 221 drugstores in 
eight states to Reliable Holdings Corp. of Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The sale covers Revco stores in western Tennessee and all stores in Illinois, 
Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan and Missouri. The purchase price was 
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Revco, at one time the nation's largest drugstore chain with about 1,900 stores 
in 27 states, has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 
July, 1988, so the deal must be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
Reliable Holdings is a partnership formed by Acadia Partners LP of Ft. Worth 
and Reliable Drug Stores Inc., a 112-store chain headquartered in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement was the first major step in Revco's reorganization plan, 
announced Jan. 26, to sell 712 of its stores in 17 states.

Arnold Staloff, the president and chief executive officer of the New York 
Commodity Exchange, is resigning effective May 1, the exchange announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The Comex said only that Staloff was leaving to pursue other business 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
But the New York Times reported today that he resigned under pressure Thursday 
night after only eight months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Staloff won a reputation as an innovator of financial products when he was a 
senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and president of the 
Philadelphia Board of Trade, the Times said. The newspaper quoted unnamed Comex 
employees as saying he resigned because of "difficulties in working with the 
members of the exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Comex officials weren't immediately available to comment on the report. Staloff 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Comex members, mainly trading houses and individual traders, have a 
reputation for being strong-willed and effectively run the exchange, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Comex is the nation's largest futures exchange for gold and other precious 
metals.

Avon Products Inc., the cosmetics and jewelry giant, said today that it has 
terminated the sale of its profitable Avon Japan unit to two Japanese firms but 
plans to resume talks with other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
The company has operated in Japan for 20 years with a network of 350,000 sales 
representatives. It announced the sale of the unit in February for $450 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The company, facing a takeover threat from a dissident investor group, has been 
trying to reduce its $696 million in debt and boost its profits. The sale of 
the Japan unit would go a long way toward achieving that goal.

Music publishing pioneer Wesley Rose, a "cornerstone" of the country music 
industry who helped launch the careers of such balladeers as Hank Williams and 
Marty Robbins, died Thursday after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. He 
was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was the founding chairman of the Country Music Assn. and a member of the 
Country Music Hall of Fame. Under his management, Acuff-Rose Publishing, which 
was founded in 1942 by his father, Fred Rose, and country singer Roy Acuff, 
became the largest and most well-respected music publishing firm in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
Acuff-Rose was bought by Opryland Management Group in 1985, reportedly for $20 
million. The publishing house is considered to hold more major song titles than 
any other firm on Music Row. Among its classics are "Rocky Top," "Tennessee 
Waltz," "Elvira," "Sweet Dreams," "Release Me," "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" 
and the entire catalogue of Hank Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Rose retired after selling Acuff-Rose. He was inducted into the Country Music 
Hall of Fame in 1986.

Mstislav Rostropovich, artistic director of the National Symphony Orchestra, 
today compared restrictions on federal aid to the arts to the Soviet Union's 
censorship of writers, artists and composers. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before a Senate hearing on financing for the National Endowment for 
the Arts, Rostropovich recalled how he had chafed under Soviet censorship and 
smuggled out of that country a symphony, "Babiy Yar" by D.D. Shostakovich. 
</P>
<P>
"It was that life under censorship that led me to the United States," 
Rostropovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Only now, he said, are Soviet people learning about some of their own writers 
and seeing their works published. 
</P>
<P>
"Art and literature should be judged by the conscience of the creator, his 
peers in his field and all of the people, not by a separate bureaucracy, 
artificially compressing the arteries and veins of this life-sustaining 
circulation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rostropovich was among the witnesses supporting reauthorization of the NEA 
before the education, arts and humanities subcommittee of the Senate Labor and 
Human Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA has come under intense criticism for works of art produced by artists 
who received support from the endowment and which were judged by some to be 
obscene or offensive.

Theatrical impresario Joseph Papp has rejected a $50,000 National Endowment of 
the Arts grant, saying he will not accept the restrictions on obscenity the 
agency has imposed since October, a published report said today. 
</P>
<P>
Papp, director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, had been offered the 
federal grant to help underwrite the Festival Latino, a monthlong program of 
Latin American theater, music and films set for August, The New York Times

</P>
<P>
Papp's decision to turn down the grant comes at a time of financial struggle 
for his ventures.

"It's a difficult time for us," he told the newspaper. "We're losing 'A Chorus 
Line' tomorrow, and we have a deficit of over $2.5 million right now. This is 
the worst time for me to do this. It's a matter of censorship. How could I 
produce plays by Vaclav Havel and do that?"

Game show host Bert Convy, 50, was in fair condition and underwent tests 
Thursday to determine why he collapsed during a hospital visit with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"They are still running some tests to try to figure out why he passed out," 
said Ron Wise, spokesman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "His condition is 
listed as fair and he's stable." On Sunday, the "Win, Lose or Draw" host was 
visiting his mother, Monica, who has been hospitalized for a stroke, and he 
passed out, Wise said. The nature of the tests wasn't disclosed.

OAKLAND A'S LA RUSSA TRADES WORDS WITH FAN

Oakland A's manager Tony La Russa got involved in some unusual pregame activity 
Thursday night when he exchanged angry words with a spectator at Memorial 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Watson, 23, of Towson, Md., said La Russa challenged him to a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Watson listed his vital information as 6-foot-3 and 320 pounds; La Russa, 45, 
is 6-1 and 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had challenged Watson to a fight, La Russa said, "I don't have any 
comment." He paused before adding, "He made an uncalled-for family reference." 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred during Oakland's batting practice, about an hour before 
the start of the A's-Orioles game. Watson was sitting with two friends in the 
seats alongside the first-base line when La Russa walked past with a baseball 
bat in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Watson initiated the exchange by shouting a comment about La Russa's wife. 
After a brief, loud conversation that caught the attention of nearby 
spectators, La Russa knocked over Watson's beer -- which had been sitting atop 
the tarpaulin -- with the handle of his bat. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'I hear you have a good-looking wife,' " Watson said. "He said, 
'Do you have a problem with my wife?' Then he said, 'Why don't you step out of 
the bleachers, and we'll see what kind of problem you've got.' 
</P>
<P>
"He offered to fight me after the game. He told me to meet him by the bus on 
the third-base side, and he said he'd be there. 
</P>
<P>
"That old man thinks he's going to kick my ass? Look at me. He won't kick my 
ass. If he hits me, I'll take his paycheck for the year."

Eric Dickerson, the NFL's seventh all-time leading rusher with 11,226 yards, 
may not be retiring despite threats to the contrary, an adviser to the 
Indianapolis Colts' running back said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Eric really wants to play football again," said Daryl Henry, 
Dickerson's close friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He just doesn't want to play in Indianapolis." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Dickerson said in an interview WFYI-TV in Indianapolis that he was 
"through with football." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Pryor 
</P>
<P>
But Dickerson has softened his position, Henry said in an article in the 
Indianapolis Star. "As far as playing football in Indianapolis, that is a dead 
issue," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson is under contract with the Colts to play next season for $1.45 
million, the final year of the contract he signed following his trade to 
Indianapolis by the Los Angeles Rams in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts hold a minicamp next week, in which veterans are required to attend. 
"He won't be there," Henry said.

Former world junior-welterweight champion Aaron Pryor was ordered today to 
undergo two years of drug treatment and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton County Municipal Judge Mark P. Painter approved a motion by Pryor's 
attorney, Hebert Haas, that Pryor be given treatment for drug dependency in 
lieu of conviction of a drug paraphernalia charge. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor, who lives in suburban Forest Park, was arrested Sept. 4 after Cincinnati 
police found a metal pipe used for smoking cocaine when his vehicle was 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor, 33, testified he was in a Cleveland hospital for drug treatment for 28 
days and was released March 17. He said he has had follow-up treatment at the 
hospital, and admitted he was drug-dependent. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor entered a no-contest plea. Painter stayed a decision on guilt. He said 
Pryor could face 90 days in jail if he has a problem during the next two years.

Three members of Northwestern State University's women's basketball team -- 
including the top scorer last season -- have been arrested and accused of 
burglaries in two parishes. 
</P>
<P>
The three Lady Demons told authorities they "were just out drinking . . . and 
lost their minds," said Pleasant Hill Marshal Clyde Callens, who arrested two 
of the players. 
</P>
<P>
Booked Thursday in DeSoto Parish on two counts of burglary were Iris Dixon, 20, 
a junior starting guard and the leading scorer; Tammy Blankenship, 19, a 
sophomore guard; and Tami Knotts, 18, a freshman point guard. 
</P>
<P>
They also were charged with burglary in Sabine Parish.

FEATHERS FLY OVER TRACK'S PIGEON ATTACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Dead pigeons by the dozens were tumbling from the sky around San Mateo and 
neighboring Foster City and the local humane society was at first puzzled, then 
upset when it found out why. 
</P>
<P>
After checking, officials discovered that Bay Meadows Race Track had poisoned 
the birds in a "last resort" effort to protect its stabled race horses from 
catching pigeon-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the track in San Mateo said about 3,500 pigeons flocked around the 
stables, and some expensive horses had become sick with salmonella transmitted 
by pigeon droppings that got into hay and feed. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 pigeons ate poisoned feed set out by a pest control firm, flew off 
and started plummeting earthward in San Mateo and Foster City. But the 
poisoning scared off almost all the other pigeons "and now there are very few 
there," Steve LeBlanc of the pest control firm said at midweek. 
</P>
<P>
Track spokesman Romain Roberts said the pigeons "were roosting above the stalls 
and their droppings were falling into the hay and the feed. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more horses -- some with a value of $100,000 or greater -- were 
getting sick. The horsemen's association and the vet said something had to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said putting out the poisoned corn was a "last resort." 
</P>
<P>
"We'd tried everything else," he said. "We'd trap them, tag them and take them 
a long ways away and let them go. And what they'd do was fly right back to the 
track because they're pigeons and that's what pigeons do. Loud noises like 
(blank) gunshots wouldn't work because that would spook the horses more than 
the birds." 
</P>
<P>
Humane Society Director Kim Sturla said her group was "pretty darned upset 
about it" after counting about 150 poisoned pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
Sturla said the group believed that some alternative method of ridding the 
track of diseased birds would have worked. 
</P>
<P>
"What they did was perfectly legal," she said, "but whether it was right is a 
whole other issue."

If video circulation at the county's public libraries is any indication, some 
of the bloom may be off home movie viewing. Between 1988 and 1989, circulation 
of videocassettes declined 2% -- this after a 6% increase between 1987 and 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Videos circulate in 27 branches of the county public library, and during 1989 
there were declines from 1988 at 14 of them. 
</P>
<P>
The La Habra branch circulated 51,156 movies (or 8% of the county total) in 
1989, the most at any location. In terms of a single community, though, Irvine 
viewers were busiest, checking out nearly 72,000 movies at the city's two 
branches -- nearly 40% more than the three branches in Garden Grove and 83% 
more than Costa Mesa's two libraries.

Fur was literally flying out of Harrods in London last Saturday . The luxury 
department store almost gave coats away and closed its 100-year-old fur salon. 
Animal rights activists claimed a victory, but a Harrods spokesperson denied 
the firm had bowed to outside pressure. The store will continue to offer a 
number of fur-related services, including a cold-storage facility that houses 
7,000 furs during the summer. Despite the heat closer to home, Dennis Rosoff, 
owner of Rosoff Furs in Beverly Hills, didn't duck our questions: "It's really 
up for grabs if the industry will survive. But I think we will. I think it's a 
hypocritical situation, when you realize that every Thanksgiving 150 million 
turkeys are slaughtered in the United States. Instead of asking me how I feel 
about Harrods, how about asking me how I feel about Aspen having an 
overwhelming vote in favor of fur? It was wonderful."

CAMERA READY: Anne Bancroft tried out two new looks during a photo session for 
Lear's magazine. "Straight and sultry" or "curly and fun" is how hair stylist 
Allen Edwards describes the variations of her shoulder-grazing classic cut. One 
thing Edwards did not change is the lock of golden blond hair that Bancroft, a 
brunette, had dyed to match the wig she donned for her role in a recent play, 
"The Mystery of the Rose Bouquet." 
</P>
<P>
THE MONOGRAM GAME: DKNY -- Donna Karan's mega-successful lower-priced 
sportswear collection -- is the recipient of the greatest form of flattery -- 
imitation. In January, Barami Enterprises came out with a line called BKNY. A 
Karan employee discovered a BKNY skirt in a New York discount store with a logo 
featuring "the same lettering style on the label," according to Patti Cohen, 
vice president of advertising and public relations for Donna Karan. A trademark 
infringement was filed by DKNY and later withdrawn in lieu of an agreement 
between DKNY and BKNY, according to Baram Hakakian, president of Barami 
Enterprises and Cohen. Now, JNY, a collection by Jones New York, is hanging in 
department stores across the country. And the label looks a lot like Karan's. 
Jones New York declined to comment on the similarity. Cohen says DKNY attorneys 
are "very much aware of the situation, but right now, nothing has been done."

'HOMEBOY': ONE FINAL LUNGE AT A HAPPY ENDING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seth Morgan is back at his old place of employment, a Bourbon Street strip 
joint that's as black as a hole in the universe, save the dingy neon galaxies 
of liquor signs and revolving disco lights. On a red tongue of a stage, just 
inches from the nearest patrons, a young woman in a G-string writhes in the 
undulating illumination. From the surrounding darkness, eyes are fixed on her 
body like suction cups. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan looks on matter-of-factly. Now 41, he's worked in the flesh trades for 
years, turning his hand to pimping, drug-dealing and armed robbery. Along the 
way he was Janis Joplin's lover and a fellow inmate of "Charlie" Manson at 
Vacaville state prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan's life as a thug has a twist. The son of Frederick Morgan, founder 
of the venerable literary journal, the Hudson Review, and scion of an old-line 
New York family, he is the quintessential rich kid gone bad: an ex-con, 
ex-addict, ex-alcoholic, now back from the netherworld on the road to 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
He has brought with him a first novel, "Homeboy," based on his experiences in 
San Francisco's Tenderloin district in the 1970s and his three years in 
Vacaville on a five-to-life sentence for armed robbery. Careening through the 
underbelly of American life, the narrative focuses on the autobiographically 
drawn protagonist, Joe Speaker, a barker/pimp at a low-life dive, and his 
"squeeze," Kitty Litter, a stripper-prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
To be published in May by Random House, the book has a fast-track jailhouse 
beat that is winning early attention in publishing circles. "It's the real 
thing," confirms an editor who worked on the manuscript. Morgan's agent, Gloria 
Loomis, adds more portentously, "Seth isn't all the way out of the woods." 
</P>
<P>
On a spring evening, when the magnolias are in bloom on the lawns of the city's 
antebellum homes, Morgan tramps down Bourbon Street, revisiting his old French 
Quarter haunts. He is still a recognized face on the street. Dope peddlers 
whisper their wares in his ear; prostitutes, slipping off to the shadows, greet 
him by name. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit town three years ago, Morgan worked as a barker at the strip joint 
he now visits, drawing in tourists and convention crowds with a slick patter of 
promises. His then-girlfriend, a prostitute who turned tricks to pay their way 
from San Francisco, was a stripper there. (He salutes her: "a good whore, a 
real race horse.") 
</P>
<P>
Morgan came to New Orleans intent on drinking himself to death. "I ran out of 
highway," he says. "I ran out of space to run away from myself." Instead, he 
wrote "Homeboy," appropriately choosing a literary salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Raised on Park Avenue, in an apartment filled with rare books, Morgan wandered 
among get-togethers of such literary pals of his father's as T.S. Eliot, Robert 
Lowell and Anthony Burgess. He read Latin at St. Bernard's, a tony Manhattan 
elementary school, and left on cue to prep at Hotchkiss in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
But early on, a son's fears and an adolescent's perception of social-register 
hypocrisy lethally combined, turning the young aristocrat into a budding 
criminal. Sexual liaisons with town girls and the extortion of school money 
from fellow students got him sacked from Hotchkiss, while participation in 
group sex with the daughter of a prominent businessman earned his subsequent 
ouster from the American School in Lugano, Switzerland. After a Holden 
Caulfield-style binge through Manhattan and an alcoholic stint in Mexico, 
Morgan was accepted at UC Berkeley with a sophomore standing in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Here he graduated from liquor and marijuana to cocaine and heroin, running a 
drug shuttle to the East Coast and becoming enmeshed with his most famous 
client, Janis Joplin. He rode his Harley-Davidson out to her Marin County house 
to peddle a gram of cocaine and soon after moved in as her lover. Morgan 
recalls the singer as a "simple girl with home values" who today would be 
reading something on the order of Tom Clancey's "The Hunt for Red October." 
"She wanted us to get married on a cruise ship," he says, adding that the last 
call before her death was to city hall inquiring about a marriage license. 
</P>
<P>
"We had fun sex," recalls Morgan, who found himself to be considered a "status" 
lover. "Everybody wanted to know what Janis Joplin saw in me." A full-fledged 
heroin addict by then, Morgan dropped out of Berkeley in his senior year and 
says he joined up with the most beautiful, fatal woman he could find -- Clint 
Eastwood's "squeeze." 
</P>
<P>
The couple married to get cash wedding presents to support their heroin 
addiction. It was Morgan's second round of matrimonial vows; the first 
marriage, annulled after six months, was to a young woman who was paralyzed in 
a drunken crash on his motorcycle. "I married her to keep her from suing me," 
he says, adding with a burst of hoarse laughter: "She sued me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
With his second wife, he descended into the Orphean depths of the Tenderloin. 
Working as a barker and pimping for the strippers-cum-prostitutes, he would 
save the wealthier customers for his spouse. 
</P>
<P>
"This didn't cause any problem," he says. "Knowing she'd just made love over 
the course of the evening didn't bother me one way or another when I made love 
to her." 
</P>
<P>
Partners in crime, the couple started hustling drug money by snatching purses 
from elderly women and playing out the con act known as "the Murphy." "She'd 
pick up a trick and take'm to a hotel room," Morgan says of his wife. "She'd go 
to the bathroom and drop the keys out of the window. Then I'd come in and 
strong-arm the guy when he was naked." 
</P>
<P>
From there it was an easy step to emptying cash registers at gun-point, and, on 
a day in 1977 when his luck ran out, to a cell in Vacaville prison. In plea 
bargaining with the district attorney, Morgan says he took the rap for full 
sentencing, allowing his wife to get off with a stint in a half-way house. She 
skipped out six months later, and, according to the Vacaville grapevine, Morgan 
says, she picked up with a murderer fresh out of Folsom, shot-gunning their old 
drug connection. "He was cold-blooded himself, but he didn't need killing," 
says Morgan, who divorced his wife while still in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Vacaville, some of the company was no better. Morgan saw "the cold fire" 
in killers' eyes and was on speaking terms with mass murderer Manson. He 
remembers Manson as "a dim-witted, ineffectual guy," who, in his loneliness, 
would send cigarettes to new inmates via cockroach couriers tied to a thread. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, after a life of hustling, Morgan found prison offered a quiet, 
constructive time. "It was like an ashram," he says. After swabbing maximum 
security cells on Saturday mornings, he would take his radio out to the prison 
yard and listen to the Metropolitan Opera's broadcast. He took voluminous notes 
on prison life and won a writing award from the PEN literary association for a 
story about the last days of Janis Joplin. One "sentimental Christmas," he 
re-established contact with his father after a hiatus of several years. "He 
wrote back and told me he loved me," Morgan says. 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan still wasn't ready for the straight-and-narrow. No sooner was he 
back out on the street in 1980 than he was back at his old barker's job in the 
Tenderloin. Soon he was also hooked up with a fan infatuated with his PEN award 
and who had been doing time for drug sales in Georgia. Sending her plane fare 
to the West Coast, he set her up as a stripper, then proceeded to become a 
"knock-down" alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, he and another prostitute began what he calls "a horrific 
hegira" across the country. "She would turn tricks to get me a room and booze. 
We would go from town to town, smashing up motels, getting warrants, going to 
jail." 
</P>
<P>
By the time they reached New Orleans, Morgan was spiritually anesthetized. "I 
made a choice to die or write," he says, finishing his life's narration. "It 
sounds like a B-movie cliche. But I've lived life in a lethal context so long 
that it's true yet trite." 
</P>
<P>
He also sees writing as a sort of moral expurgation. "I hope that if any of my 
victims read 'Homeboy,' they will feel I have atoned for the wrong I've done 
them." And he has worked out an analysis of cause that centers on his 
now-deceased alcoholic mother (his father has since remarried twice). It was 
her diminished maternal affection, he says, that left both him and an older 
brother with a fatal sense of abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
While his brother committed suicide, vaulting from the Oakland Bay Bridge while 
a student at Stanford, Morgan adopted a sociopath's behavior ("I can con the 
paint off the wall," he says), honing skills of deceit and manipulation aimed 
principally at women. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'd do under the influence of cocaine is plan the strategic degradation 
of women," he concedes. "I wouldn't touch a woman unless I wanted sex." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to work out his feelings in a second book, pondering the substantial 
consequence: "If I allow a woman to love me, then I accept the world." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he laughs benignly at offers by new publishing pals to fix him up 
with a nice Ivy League graduate: He still feels more comfortable in the company 
of whores. 
</P>
<P>
But their incursions into his life are becoming more controlled (the last, he 
says, "was a pretty straight chick"), and his need to satiate his writing 
addiction has become his overriding concern. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Fortress Morgan," he declares, waving at the house he has purchased. 
It is a neglected example of Greek Revival architecture, filled with a pastiche 
of curbside furniture along with red satin chairs and Classical garden 
statuary, inherited from his grandmother's Palm Beach residence. 
</P>
<P>
It is a household constructed on the camaraderie of men: a recovering 
adolescent drug addict, whose mother was one of Morgan's bed-mates, and a 
homeless man who does chores around the place in exchange for room and board. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan rules over this family like a parental potentate, alternately ranting at 
the boy for staying out late, and, in a habit learned from his father, reading 
him bedtime passages from "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." 
</P>
<P>
On an afternoon's outing, he rummages through antique shops, buying a regulator 
clock for his office and even considering acquiring a set of rare books. He 
looks at a pair of cowboy boots, albeit at a sex paraphernalia shop, and buys 
fresh fruit and vegetables for his cook at a roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
At outdoor market stalls in the French Quarter, he picks up a Soviet Army watch 
for his ward. "To teach him to come home on time," he declares. He admires it 
as he draws on a soda in a nearby bar, and only later, when he is half-way down 
the block, does he discover the watch is missing. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the bar, he waves a $5 bill as reward for the $15 purchase, but there 
are no takers. Charging down the street like a wounded bull, he allows that, 
sure, he once would have stolen the watch in a flash. "But for $5, I would have 
given it back."

THROUGH SICK AND THIN, THE WORLD WATCHES TAYLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Her movies now are few and far between, but when she is ill, the world still 
stands at attention. Liz Taylor's latest bout with pneumonia has drawn the kind 
of intense scrutiny normally accorded presidential polyps. It has inspired a 
raft of rumors and handed up a field day for the giddy tabloids. And today, yet 
again, everyone is talking about La Liz. 
</P>
<P>
But then Liz Taylor, 58, has always lived a life of extremes. If she has 
enjoyed the most brilliant career and the glare of fame, she has also survived 
seven rocky marriages to six men, the frailest health and the most frightening 
bouts with addiction to booze, drugs and food. And through it all, there have 
been armies of press recording each divorce, each hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
It was partly to still the gossips that Taylor's doctors called a press 
conference Wednesday at St. John's Hospital and Medical Center in Santa Monica. 
No AIDS, they said. No cancer. For the tabloid press had been humming with 
rumors that Liz Taylor had AIDS virtually since she was checked into Daniel 
Freeman Hospital in Marina del Rey April 9 with a high fever and sinus 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
And when Taylor's publicists first issued flat denials, the press went on to 
speculate about the speculation. Did the AIDS rumors start because of Taylor's 
ballyhooed friendship with publishing titan Malcolm Forbes, whose recent death 
touched off reports about his alleged homosexuality? Or was it because of her 
reputation as a major fund-raiser for the disease? Or because one of her 
doctors, Michael Roth, was a renowned AIDS specialist -- even though Roth was 
supervising her treatment for drug and alcohol addiction as early as 1983? 
</P>
<P>
"Liz is a national treasure and when she entered the hospital, I thought it was 
as important as the President of the U.S. going in and we treated it as such. 
Liz is as close to American royalty as you can have, and our readers . . . in 
the heartland . . . they're living and dying with her," said Barry Levine, 
Hollywood bureau chief of the Star, which featured a cover photograph of Liz, 
hooked up to an intravenous tube and oxygen mask, being transferred from the 
Marina del Rey hospital to St. John's. Levine declined comment on a rumor 
circulating among reporters that the tabloid had paid $50,000 for the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Some press coverage has bent over backwards to tug at the bounds of 
credibility; the National Enquirer has Liz communing with the ghosts of Forbes 
and one-time husband Richard Burton. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Liz's current illness has drawn the most attention yet, according to 
her publicist, Chen Sam. More than 100 reporters, photographers and cameramen 
converged on St. John's, many of whom had flown in from around the country for 
the 15-minute press conference. Behind a chorus line of video cameras -- 
representing the major networks, the local stations, CNN and the tabloid shows 
-- reporters peppered the doctors with pointed and sometimes testy questions 
about Taylor's treatment and drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard some guys talking behind me, saying, 'I can't believe they're hounding 
her like this.' I felt like saying, 'Are you offended reading about her?' " 
sniffed Val Richardson, a reporter from the Washington Times who'd flown in 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the news was good. Taylor was off a respirator and breathing with 
the help of an oxygen mask. She had apparently rebounded from a bad weekend, 
when doctors feared she might die. Although Taylor's physicians are still 
trying to identify the virus, they are treating her for pneumonia with 
antibiotics. And she remains in the intensive-care unit, but she continues to 
improve and is expected to move to a regular room this weekend, Sam said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her own security guards keep watch over her private room in 
intensive care. She has received her four children -- Christopher and Michael 
Wilding, Maria Burton-Carson and Liza Todd-Tivey -- friends Roddy McDowall and 
Carole Bayer Sager and Liz's younger, ex-trucker boyfriend, Larry Lee 
Fortensky, 38. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw her yesterday and I was really pleased," Sager said Wednesday. "I 
thought her color was good. She couldn't speak because she had the respirator. 
Her eyes were clear and she definitely understood what I said and motioned, 
made me know she understood." 
</P>
<P>
If Liz's public is fascinated by her frailties, perhaps reassured somehow by 
the knowledge that even the gods are vulnerable, their interest is also piqued 
by the public face she puts on her relentless brushes with illness and 
addiction. The Taylor wit shone through even Wednesday's press conference, when 
doctors passed on the actress' desire to "come out and wave at you, but she 
wasn't in her balcony attire." "I think she's extraordinarily brave," Sager 
said. "She just has an enormous reservoir of inner strength that she calls on 
when she has to. All of us were encouraged and optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
She has needed it. Taylor's respiratory ailments alone have been a recurring 
problem. Bronchitis and laryngitis brought down the curtain on numerous 
performances of "The Little Foxes," which Taylor starred in on Broadway in 
1981, and Noel Coward's "Private Lives," which toured the country in 1983. The 
cancellations prompted the play's co-producer, Zev Bufman, to declare, 
"Bronchitis has plagued Elizabeth all her life." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Taylor has been plagued by health woes ever since her 1945 film debut 
in "National Velvet"; her fall from a horse triggered a lifetime of back 
trouble. And when Taylor retired from films to marry the Republican senator 
from Virginia, John Warner, her well-being continued to make headlines; she 
choked on a chicken bone and wrenched her back after slipping on a carpet at a 
reception honoring former President Gerald R. Ford. Over the years she has 
endured about 20 major operations on her back, appendix, eyes and teeth; when 
the Asian flu threatened Taylor's life, doctors made a hole in her throat so 
she could breathe. 
</P>
<P>
But it has been her wrestling matches with weight and addiction that have 
consistently lured the world's curiosity and, at times, admiration. Taylor's 
unhappy stint as a politician's wife prompted her weight to balloon to 180 
pounds. When she emerged a born-again beauty in 1985 after shedding 60 pounds, 
and wrote a beauty book to boot, she was applauded by many -- including 
comedian Joan Rivers, who had made fat-Liz jokes the mainstay of her act. 
</P>
<P>
"For somebody like me who is obsessive, it's amazing I was never a gambler," 
she said at the time. "I could have become anorexic. I got to a size 4 and 
said, 'Why not a size 2?' Then I slapped myself and went from 118 to 122, which 
is the right weight for me." 
</P>
<P>
But her battles against addiction have played havoc with her fight against the 
bulge. And her persistent back problems have nurtured her dependence on pills. 
Her addictions have even been linked to a criminal investigation by the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office; last week, prosecutors announced 
that no charges would be filed against Taylor's doctors, who had been accused 
of over-prescribing dependence-forming drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the first celebrity known to enter the Betty Ford clinic in Rancho 
Mirage, made a public example of her willingness to take on her addictions in 
two heavily publicized stays there. 
</P>
<P>
When Taylor first checked in, in 1983, she admitted to 35 years of addiction to 
pain killers and sleeping pills. She kept a diary that poignantly described 
that stay as "probably the first time since I was 9 that nobody's wanted to 
exploit me. Now the bad news. I feel like hell. I'm going through withdrawal. 
My heart feels big and pounding. I can feel the blood rush through my body. I 
can almost see it, running like red water over the boulders in my pain-filled 
neck and shoulders, then through my ears and into my pounding head. My eyelids 
flutter. Oh God, I am so, so tired." 
</P>
<P>
But the Betty Ford clinic encouraged Taylor only to fight the good fights that 
had brought her there, rather than take on all addictions -- to drugs and food 
-- at once. And the late '80s had found Liz, hobbled by back pain, returning to 
those two sources of comfort. Taylor regained much of the weight, even though 
she took her drug problems in hand once again in a second stay at the Betty 
Ford clinic in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But through her ordeals, she has remained the same charmingly vain Liz who once 
declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels. She never budged from her room 
at Betty Ford without her trademark darkened eyebrows. And even when she was 
ambushed recently by a Star photographer, Liz couldn't help being, well, Liz. 
</P>
<P>
Says the Star's Levine: "No matter how sick she was, when someone down on the 
ground told her she was being photographed, she put on sunglasses, even though 
she had an IV in her arm, as if to cover herself up. Typical Liz Taylor. It was 
sad and sweet, at the same time."

IS HARAMINA ARRIVING IN THE NICK OF TIME?; 
</P>
<P>
SOCKERS: HE HAS SPENT MUCH OF THE SEASON IN PAIN FOLLOWING HIS ARRIVAL IN A 
TRADE FROM KANSAS CITY, BUT HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE PAST FEW GAMES MAY BODE WELL 
FOR THE MISL PLAYOFFS.

<P>
He often could be found standing in the locker room in street clothes watching 
teammates prepare for a game. And nobody ever scored a game-winning goal 
wearing slacks and a dress shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Damir Haramina has dealt with more than a sore quadriceps and strained knee 
this season. A forward acquired during preseason by the Sockers from Kansas 
City for a conditional draft pick, Haramina has had an abundance of time to 
wonder if he will ever regain the form that made him the Comets' third-leading 
scorer of all time. 
</P>
<P>
He has played only 18 games as a Socker and, until he scored four goals in the 
final three games of the regular season, didn't have many reasons to be 
optimistic about his future in the MISL. His eight goals and four assists look 
a bit thin compared with 111 and 65 in 143 games with the Comets. His 
statistics are downright skinny considering his total salary of $60,000, which 
includes $15,000 paid by Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
But Haramina, 27, has had trouble ridding himself of all the nagging pains. It 
was the same thing last season, when he scored just three goals in 13 games for 
the Comets after undergoing separate surgeries for a cracked kneecap and then a 
hernia. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was eager to show his new teammates what he could do, Haramina told 
Socker Coach Ron Newman he was fit to play for this season's opener in Dallas. 
It was a bad decision. He wasn't ready to go full speed and wound up having to 
miss the next 13 games with a quadriceps strain. 
</P>
<P>
When he was finally healthy, Newman was reluctant to play him. He wasn't sure 
he was ready to do the things the Sockers needed him to do, such as take 
pressure off Branko Segota. So Haramina had to stand around and listen to 
people question his ability and desire. 
</P>
<P>
Did this team really want him? Or was he just proof that even Newman, winner of 
seven championships, was capable of striking a bum deal? 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, sure, people start to talk," says Haramina, originally from 
Yugoslavia. "But I don't care. I don't listen. I know how good I am. I know how 
good I can play. You get disappointed, but I'm a strong person. I never lost 
confidence in myself." 
</P>
<P>
But Newman did. He considered trading him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had lost confidence in him," Newman says. "I needed to see that he had more 
confidence in training before I could risk playing him again. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running out of time. We needed help, and we kept looking there, and 
there wasn't any. We took him thinking any minute he was going to start playing 
again. We took a gamble. It looked like we lost the gamble." 
</P>
<P>
Though it might not have been evident at times, Haramina had a fairly strong 
support group. Midfielder Brian Quinn, who also missed a number of games with 
injuries, kept telling him not to get discouraged. Segota and Haramina would 
talk, too; Segota has been through this. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what it's like," Segota says. "I can relate. The same thing happened to 
me the year before. It's awful. It's the worst thing for a player." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure Newman was under to win, he was sympathetic to Haramina's 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
"I stuck up for him in many ways when other people thought he couldn't play 
through pain," Newman said. "I said 'I don't think it has to do with playing 
through pain.' His big fear is that he will do it (hurt himself) again. 
</P>
<P>
"We all get impatient because we think, 'Why doesn't he just bite the bit and 
get after it.' But I could see what was going through his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Haramina's personality often requires people to guess what he's thinking. He is 
soft spoken, rarely initiating a conversation. That isn't to say he doesn't 
have opinions, but you don't usually hear them until you get to know him a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Freeman, public relations director of the Comets, used to room with 
Haramina on trips. One time, Haramina walked into the hotel room and saw 
Freeman tearing his hair out trying to figure out how to pronounce names from a 
roster of a Soviet team that Kansas City was to play in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
Haramina asked him what he was doing, and Freeman told him he couldn't get a 
handle on all the strange names. With "The Beverly Hillbillies" blaring in the 
background, Haramina sat down and meticulously began to write out a roster of 
phonetic spellings, which Freeman eventually distributed to all the radio 
announcers. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's the little gestures that are most remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't miss him in the scoring department," Freeman says, "but we miss the 
person. He's a very kind man." 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to blame Kansas City Coach Dave Clements for trading Haramina, who 
was tentative about his return after his injuries. Haramina was a high salary 
player, and Clements expected productivity. 
</P>
<P>
It's tough to fault Haramina, either. He spent hours in the weight room 
rehabilitating his knee after surgery. His legs were perhaps stronger 
afterward, and he started playing again, but soon after, he felt a twinge in 
his midsection. The doctor told him he had a hernia and would have to have 
surgery again. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, man, I went crazy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
After that, he was never able to get back on track in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"(Clements) just didn't want to play me," Haramina says. "I don't know what his 
problem was. He just didn't probably like me because I'm quiet. I did a lot for 
that team." 
</P>
<P>
When he saw things weren't going to change at the beginning of this season, 
Haramina requested a trade, and Clements obliged. Haramina came to the Sockers 
with a fresh start, but until about two weeks ago, there was nothing fresh 
about it. It was the same old thing. He was injured, and he was a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
But last weekend, in victories over Wichita and Tacoma, everybody finally saw 
why Haramina created such a stir in Kansas City. He scored three goals, and the 
velocity of his shot was enough to make Socker goalie Victor Nogueira marvel. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how fast he shoots," Nogueira was saying after the 6-1 victory 
over Tacoma. "I wouldn't want to have to be the goalie in front of that." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't any big deal to Haramina. 
</P>
<P>
"That's me," he says. "That's how I play." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction from his teammates? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they say 'That's normal,' " he says. " 'That's Damir.' " 
</P>
<P>
If the real Damir stays standing, the Sockers will get a much-needed offensive 
lift in their best-of-five playoff series with St. Louis, which starts Saturday 
night at 8:30 in the San Diego Sports Arena. In the back of Newman's mind, even 
when he was filled with doubts, he knew Haramina could come around and do some 
special things. Ultimately, that probably kept him from trading him. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt as soon as we traded him," Newman says, "it would be just then that he 
started to put it together again." 
</P>
<P>
If Newman's patience paid off, so too did Haramina's. Through all the 
frustration of what was nearly a lost season, Haramina, true to his nature, 
kept mum and waited for his opportunity. Verbal jousts and controversy are 
common on this team, but Haramina refused to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to talk," he says. "I'm not one of those guys who talks. I just 
like to play." 
</P>

MIKE PENNER: HE'S GOING COCONUTS ABOUT BEING A RAM 
</P>

<P>
Bern Brostek is no dummy, but talking to him in person suggests the presence of 
a ventriloquist in the near vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
Brostek's face, from pudgy cheeks to crew-cut top, is pure Spanky. Our Gang 
Goes Circuit Training. But the voice, that voice. Hear it once and you wonder 
where the luau went. Brostek looks Iowa but speaks Island, reciting, in 
convincing fashion, the wonders of poi and his recipe for Kalua pig. 
</P>
<P>
A one-man melting pot, Brostek is part Russian, part Hawaiian and soon-to-be 
full-time Ram. He was born and raised on the island of Oahu, just outside 
Honolulu, and though he spent the last four years at the University of 
Washington, Brostek still leis his hat at home in the Manoa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say, no NFL rookie enjoyed a better view of draft day than 
Brostek. Hundreds of others had nothing but Mel Kiper's hair. Brostek had 
Diamond Head. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Rams made him their No. 1 selection, Brostek spoke with 
reporters via transpacific telephonic hookup. He talked about sun and sand, 
about body surfing, about roasted pig and about how glad he was that Green Bay 
didn't draft him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be wearing my wet suit in Wisconsin," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
With the possible exception of San Diego, Brostek couldn't have hand-picked a 
better spot to begin his career as a professional interior lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just like Hawaii," he said Thursday after his first workout at Rams 
Park. "Look at this sunshine. It's terrific. I'm definitely going to have to 
check out the beach." 
</P>
<P>
And check out some surf shops. Brostek is planning to spend the next month in 
Orange County, through the May mini-camp, but with Bern, it's never all 
business and no play. A new hobby holds his interest and all he lacks is a long 
board that can hold his 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm primarily into body surfing," Brostek says, stating the obvious. "But I'm 
getting into surfing. Right now, I'm looking for a big board, one of those 
tanker boards. Something that can handle the weight." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson would prefer Brostek wait. Like until he's 35. The Rams 
have had first-round draft choices wipe out before, but never in the literal 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told me to stay away from the waves," Brostek says, smiling. "He said 
it's too dangerous. But as long as I keep my focus on football, if I take a 
weekend and go to the beach, I think that'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek is distinguished by another characteristic. As you may have heard, it 
involves his back. The doctors of the Buffalo Bills flunked Brostek after his 
pre-draft physical, citing the strange formation of the disks at the base of 
his spine. Brostek has a congenital back defect and the Rams drew predictable 
criticism when they opted to risk the disks. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, however, retaliated with some statistics. Brostek, they pointed out, 
didn't miss a Washington practice in three years and started 41 of the Huskies' 
last 42 games. And the game he sat out was prompted by a sprained knee, which 
is not located anywhere near the spinal column. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me," Brostek insists. "My doctor says the muscles in my 
lower back have compensated. They're stronger than those in most people." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek says he was unaware of the condition until he experienced some soreness 
in his back after throwing the shotput in the sixth grade. "The doctor showed 
me the X-rays and explained what it was," he says. "He didn't tell me to do 
anything differently. He just gave me some calcium pills." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek went on to star at Iolani High School in Honolulu, winning state 
championships in the shotput, discus and wrestling, along with the interest of 
most major West Coast football programs. USC, UCLA and Washington went after 
him hard. So did the University of Hawaii, which is located only minutes from 
the Brostek home. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaii was really ticked off I didn't go there," Brostek said. "And I wanted 
to stay close to home. But my dad kind of pushed me to go to Washington. He 
said, 'You've got to get out of here and experience things. In Hawaii, you have 
a sheltered life. Go away to school. You'll always have Hawaii to come back 
to.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, cold, rainy Seattle was a shock to Brostek's system. 
</P>
<P>
"The winters were hard," he says. "It was OK when you played football, but 
after the season, you're not as occupied. It was hard to sit inside and watch 
the rain come down. I'd get cabin fever." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek survived by taking a little Hawaii with him wherever he went. He 
devised a way to make a favorite dish, Kalua pig, in an oven. The traditional 
way is in a beachside pit. "I cook it in tea leaves and tar leaves, sprinkle a 
little Hawaiian salt," he says. "It's not authentic, but it tastes close." 
</P>
<P>
He plans to try it out on his new teammates, although after surveying the 
expanses of Rams Park, Brostek suggests that "maybe we should have a luau here. 
We can dig a pit in the practice field right over there." 
</P>
<P>
It's food for thought, anyway. And you have to figure Robinson wouldn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
Good draft pick, this Brostek. The Rams' image, bland as they come, always has 
been lacking a certain something and now we know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
A little Hawaiian punch.
