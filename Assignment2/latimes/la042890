COUNTER-PROTESTERS GREET 'LIGHT UP THE BORDER' GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

More than 1,000 people calling for greater enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico 
border were confronted Friday night by a group of counter-protesters who 
charged that the pro-enforcement contingent was racist and intolerant. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the "Light Up the Border Campaign" -- who have staged 
protests along the international boundary in recent months in an effort to 
dramatize what they view as the need for greater enforcement -- defended their 
movement as an effort to reduce lawlessness in the border zone. 
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with racism," said Muriel Watson, a leader of the 
pro-enforcement group. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make the border more secure for everyone, even those who cross it," 
said Watson, widow of a former U.S. Border Patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
However, the counter-protesters 
</P>
<P>
 -- who police said numbered about 175 -- charged that the pro-enforcement 
group is perpetuating negative anti-Latino sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest wave of anti-Mexican feeling that has been demonstrated in 
some time," said Ted Arriaga, a National City schoolteacher who was among those 
marching in the counter-protest. "We felt it was time for us to come out here 
and make a stand against this racism." 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that 1,300 pro-enforcement demonstrators were at the site, 
along Dairy Mart Road in San Diego, about one-half mile north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
The groups traded barbs and insults, and, although the shouts were loud, police 
reported no violence or arrests. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to dramatize their opposition to the "Light Up the Border 
Campaign," the counter-protesters held up strips of aluminum foil, mirrors and 
other reflective objects, symbolically reflecting the light back toward the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
As pro-enforcement protesters gathered along the road and turned on their 
vehicle lights, groups of undocumented immigrants were collecting on hillsides 
to the south, waiting for an opportunity to slip into the north. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead, a U.S. Border Patrol helicopter periodically played its spotlight 
over areas in the brush where officers suspected undocumented immigrants were 
hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that about 300 vehicles were used in the protest, fewer than the 
</P>
<P>
400 at a similar protest last month. Nonetheless, police said Friday's crowd 
was somewhat larger than last month's. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's event marks the sixth time that the activists have directed their 
headlights toward Tijuana. They seek the hiring of more border guards and the 
creation of more barriers, lights and obstacles to impede the influx of illegal 
aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contended that the pro-enforcement group's efforts are short-sighted 
because they encourage negative attitudes toward Latin American immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We found a lot of intolerance and a lot of racism among these people, and we 
felt we had to show a different side," said Michael Schnorr, a college 
professor who was among the counter-protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the protest, an airplane rented by some of the counter-demonstrators 
flew overhead and flashed a banner saying, "One Thousand Points of Fear. . . . 
A New Berlin Wall."

TOXIC SHOCK IN CHILDREN RE-EMERGING, OFFICIALS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: MANY CIVIL WAR SOLDIERS DIED FROM THE COMPLICATIONS OF SEVERE 
INFECTIONS. STILL RARE IN CHILDREN, CASES HAVE BECOME MORE COMMON IN THE LAST 
FIVE YEARS, WITH A SECOND REPORTED IN SAN DIEGO.

<P>
The streptococcus bacterium that invaded the body of a young girl with 
chickenpox, provoking a toxic-shock reaction that led to the amputation of her 
arms and legs, has been found recently in other children, medical officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, with the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said 
cases in which "strep" has triggered toxic shock in children have occurred 
elsewhere in the country recently, although none have been reported in medical 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, something like this can cause a lot of panic," Schwartz said. 
"Toxic-shock syndrome from streptococcus infections does occur in children, and 
has, although it's very, very rare. They're often related to wounds or other 
skin infections and occasionally occur following pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital said this week that the strain of streptococcus 
bacteria found in 6-year-old Jessica Lynn Esquivel had never been seen in a 
child in San Diego or in any documented case in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica, who was admitted April 1 with what was first believed to be a routine 
case of chickenpox, experienced full cardiac arrest, in addition to kidney, 
liver and respiratory failure. On April 18, her legs were amputated at the 
knee, and her arms at the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
A kindergarten student from Imperial Beach, Jessica remains in critical 
condition in the intensive care unit of Children's Hospital. However, Dr. Brad 
Peterson, the physician supervising her care, said he expects her to have full 
liver, kidney and respiratory recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another instance of a San Diego child incurring toxic-shock syndrome 
in conjunction with a case of chickenpox was reported to The Times and verified 
by Children's Hospital on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, 3-year-old Lauren Arnsdorff had to have the tip of her index finger 
amputated and she suffered lung damage. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marian Melish, professor of pediatrics at the University of Hawaii School 
of Medicine, said cases in which strep infections in children have led to 
serious and sometimes fatal consequences have occurred with greater regularity 
in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Melish characterized their re-emergence as having a " 'Back to the Future'-like 
effect," not unlike cases that were widely reported during the Civil War and in 
the 1910s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"Complications resulting from chickenpox -- in which the child incurs a 
secondary bacterial infection -- range from the trivial to the severe to the 
fatal," said Melish, who once taught in the pediatrics department of the UC San 
Diego School of Medicine. "Streptococcus and staphylococcus bacteria are 
considered ubiquitous, meaning they're everywhere and can enter a person's body 
any time the skin is broken. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're one of the unlucky few to incur such an infection, the results can 
be devastating and often carry a grim inevitability. In other words, it's very 
hard to rescue people from these things, especially when they lead to toxic 
shock." 
</P>
<P>
Melish said severe streptococcus infections were common during the Civil War, 
killing hundreds of soldiers, and later in history, especially the early part 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
For whatever reason, she said they're beginning to re-emerge, particularly in 
cases of toxic shock. The lesions caused by chickenpox are just one way the 
bacteria can enter the body. She said any cut can serve as a gateway. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real 'Back to the Future'-type link here," Melish said. "We're 
seeing a return to the type of strep as dangerous as those in the '40s, the 
1910s, and earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The good news for parents, Melish said, is that a chickenpox vaccine is now in 
the hands of the Food and Drug Administration and may be licensed within a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows how far away it is, but they (FDA researchers) seem convinced 
that it can be safe and effective," she said. "I'd say it's only a matter of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anne Schuchat, with the Centers for Disease Control, said toxic-shock 
syndrome, regardless of the cause, is "an uncommon occurrence," having been 
reported, as an annual average, in "five cases per 1 million population." 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty-five to 60% of all toxic shock is menstrual toxic shock, the classic 
kind associated with tampons during a menstrual period," Schuchat said. "The 
rest is associated with a number of conditions. These can occur in any time of 
skin lesion -- boils, abscesses or pox-like sores. 
</P>
<P>
"Toxic shock is quite rare, and having it associated with a single condition 
like chickenpox is extremely rare. We've had very few reports of pediatric 
toxic-shock syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lynn Arnsdorff, a San Diego mother, said her 3-year-old daughter, 
Lauren, incurred toxic shock syndrome following chickenpox last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Arnsdorff said Lauren, a patient at Children's Hospital, ended up having the 
tip of her index finger amputated and incurred minor lung damage, mainly from 
prolonged exposure to the respirator needed to help her breathe during her 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Hospital officials confirmed this week that Lauren Arnsdorff was a 
patient and a victim of toxic shock. 
</P>
<P>
"But the organism that caused the syndrome was different from that of 
Jessica's," said Mark Morelli, a hospital spokesman. "Lauren's was a 
staphylococcus bacteria, rather than the streptococcus bacteria Jessica had. 
While the shock syndromes were somewhat the same, the organism that affected 
Jessica was far more virulent." 
</P>
<P>
Arnsdorff said her daughter, who had a high fever and was having seizures, was 
taken to Children's on Sept. 8. Two nights later, the symptoms got worse. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us she would not survive the day," Arnsdorff said. "She had heart 
failure, swelling, she was totally puffed up. They put her on massive doses of 
heart medication, but her kidneys failed. 
</P>
<P>
"Although she had the chickenpox, they think she might have gotten toxic shock 
as a result of a tiny little scrape on her toe -- not a pox scrape, but one she 
had before," although doctors aren't certain of the cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We shuddered when we heard about Jessica," Arnsdorff said. "It was like this 
grim deja vu. We were told that it was so rare, in Lauren's case; it might 
never happen again. But, of course, it did, and with this poor child (Jessica), 
it was much, much worse."

EMPLOYER ARRESTED IN 'SLAVE LABOR' CASE; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: THE GROWER IS CHARGED WITH VIOLATING THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF WORKERS 
AT HIS SOMIS AND MOORPARK RANCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Ventura County flower ranch, where Mexican laborers claim they 
were imprisoned behind barbed-wire fences and forced to work for sub-minimum 
wages, was charged Friday with violating the workers' civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin M. Ives, 53, surrendered to federal authorities after early-morning raids 
by about 50 agents at his two ranches in Ventura County and his Griffith-Ives 
Co. headquarters in West Los Angeles, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Three ranch foremen and an alleged smuggler were arrested during the raids and 
arraigned Friday in Los Angeles federal court on charges that they conspired to 
smuggle workers from Mexico and to hold them in "involuntary servitude" at 
Ives' 50-acre compound in Somis, 15 miles east of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief hearing, U.S. Magistrate Venetta Tassopulos released Ives on 
$150,000 bail and freed Mauro Casares-Padilla, 64, and Pedro Pinzon-Juarez and 
Rony Havive, both 30, on $25,000 bonds. Alvaro Ruiz-Santiago, 39, remained in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
A warrant was issued for the arrest of another Ives ranch foreman, Josue David 
Pinzon-Juarez, who is out of the country, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Talcott, Ives' attorney, maintained that his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who goes out to the facility and looks with open eyes will know that 
the allegations are totally and unequivocally rubbish," Talcott said. "Nobody's 
being held there without their consent." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Klippness, the U.S. immigration agent who directed Friday's raids, 
agreed that working conditions at Ives' Somis and Moorpark ranches now appear 
good. And only two of 22 laborers found at the ranches Friday appear to be in 
the country illegally, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Klippness said Ives apparently has known that he was under investigation 
since December, when the Border Patrol arrested six illegal workers at the 
front gate of the compound. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no evidence this morning of the kinds of conditions alleged to have 
been there four months ago," Klippness said. 
</P>
<P>
Until last December, however, laborers at the Somis compound were forbidden to 
leave until $435 in debts owed to smuggler Casares-Padilla were deducted from 
their earnings, according to an Immigration Service affidavit released with the 
U.S. attorney's criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Even after debts were paid, workers were ordered not to leave the compound or 
they would be fired and immigration agents alerted, the affidavit said 20 
former ranch workers told federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
While at the ranch, the workers said, they received only a fraction of the 
$4.25-an-hour minimum wage while toiling 16 hours a day. They also told 
investigators that they were required to buy food and supplies from a company 
store at inflated prices, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
In its criminal complaint, the U.S. attorney's office cites the case of one 
worker, Juan Mendez-Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Ives and his employees kept Mendez-Cruz prisoner for eight months in 1989 by 
"refusing to allow him to leave the ranch, and forcing him to work 
approximately 16 hours a day, six days a week, and keeping him at the ranch by 
means of threats of physical harm and intimidation, and by keeping the gates to 
the ranch locked and guarded at all times." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the government's case apparently is based on evidence gathered by U.S. 
Department of Labor investigator Charles Logan. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, Logan found Griffith-Ives to have violated a 
variety of labor and health laws through inspections of the Somis compound and 
company records. 
</P>
<P>
Though Griffith-Ives would only allow inspections scheduled through its 
attorneys, Logan found "squalid and unsanitary bathrooms, showers and sinks 
which were locked with padlocks and locked refrigerators, all of which are 
violations" of law, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
Logan concluded that company payroll records appeared to be falsified, the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
Company records at the Griffith-Ives Beverly Boulevard headquarters were seized 
Friday, Klippness said. 
</P>
<P>
Charges by federal prosecutors and investigators echo those leveled by 14 
former Ives workers and their lawyers in recent interviews with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was slave labor," worker Fernando Maldonado said in an interview earlier 
this month. "We could not leave. We realized we had entered the mouth of the 
wolf." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the workers described the labor system at the compound as a mixture 
of military boot camp and medieval serfdom. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every minute of the laborers' day was controlled by supervisors, who 
used threats and physical abuse to enforce rules, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"They controlled these people through a regimen of psychological abuse and 
terror. And it worked perfectly," said Marco Antonio Abarca of California Rural 
Legal Assistance in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers were recruited from Indian villages so rural that not even Spanish 
is spoken there, the lawyers said. Once at the compound, the laborers' heads 
were shaved and they usually were forced to work from 3:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They allegedly were forbidden to drink water or to use restrooms except at 
morning and noon breaks. 
</P>
<P>
There was no break during an afternoon work period that usually lasted seven 
hours, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers who violated a lengthy list of rules would be insulted and sometimes 
pinched on the arm or struck on the back with an open hand by Havive, the 
laborers told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The workers said they received as little as $100 every two weeks after money 
for food and sundries were deducted from their checks. 
</P>
<P>
Klippness said the Immigration Service began its investigation of Griffith-Ives 
in December, as did state and federal labor agencies. The investigations 
culminated Friday with the raids at 7:30 a.m. In addition to agents from four 
federal agencies, investigators from the Ventura County district attorney's and 
sheriff's offices and the Oxnard Police Department participated. 
</P>
<P>
The local agencies were involved because state charges may also be filed 
against Griffith-Ives, Klippness said.

ZEKE AND HIS HEAP FIND A GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: PEOPLE RALLY TO THE CAUSE OF HIS HUGE COMPOST PILE, WHICH IS 
THREATENED BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Zeke the Sheik is not a man motivated by the material world, his prize 
possession being a 30-foot-high compost pile that fuels a jungle of rare cacti 
next to his run-down Altadena home. 
</P>
<P>
But ever since bureaucratic forces began to threaten that mound more than two 
months ago, the material world -- supercharged with Earth Day fervor, perhaps 
-- has come running to Zeke's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Two of his new-found supporters -- a pair of Ivy League-educated attorneys -- 
this week persuaded the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services to 
halt legal action aimed at clearing the pile, so that a less drastic solution 
can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, who had declared the heap a health hazard and an illegal 
dump, said Friday that it was simply the first time anybody had approached them 
with a reasonable alternative to hauling the whole thing away. 
</P>
<P>
"What seemed like hell has turned out to be heaven," said Zeke, the alter ego 
of Timothy Dundon, 47. "It's all because good people have been coming to the 
pile and discovering that the power they need is here. The feeling of abundant 
life inspires them." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, it has inspired a Pasadena public relations specialist -- whose 
firm usually represents slightly more mainstream clients, such as the Pasadena 
Doubletree Hotel and Jurgensen's Markets -- to act as Dundon's press agent. 
</P>
<P>
It has prompted friends to establish a defense fund, print T-shirts and set up 
a telephone number, (800) UP2-YOU2, that supporters can call to make 
contributions and arrange to receive free fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, it led to an invitation for Dundon to plant a tree at Muir High 
School in Pasadena and speak to Pasadena High School students on the topic of 
"Compost and Hope." 
</P>
<P>
"I think people see that he's a rare human being and not out to take advantage 
of anybody," said Lynne Velling of the Pasadena public relations firm Hintz 
&amp; Balvin, which is being paid a small fee by Dundon's supporters. "He's an 
example to us all." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for Dundon, his troubles have been in the spotlight during a time of 
intense environmental consciousness. Not long ago, the fate of his heap had 
looked considerably bleaker. 
</P>
<P>
In February, he incurred the wrath of county fire officials when on two 
occasions the giant mound of animal droppings, household garbage and lawn 
clippings spontaneously erupted in flames. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, health officials cited him for creating fly-breeding 
conditions and for allowing about 50 ducks, chickens and turkeys to run freely 
on his one-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
As Dundon was preparing to do battle, county officials discovered that the 
mound actually sat on an adjacent lot owned by Mountain View Cemetery. The 
cemetery, which years ago had given Dundon permission to build his pile there, 
agreed to abide with the county and remove it. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting Thursday, however, Dundon's lawyers persuaded health officials 
that the heap presented no imminent danger and that there was no legal basis to 
order its removal. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make a distinction between hazardous waste and organic material 
that can be recycled," said attorney Geoffrey D. Commons, a former member of 
the California Energy Commission, who is representing Dundon for a small fee. 
"They essentially used the power of a bureaucracy to harass him." 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Bagnera, county health inspector for the area, said he does not mind 
re-examining the matter as long as the ultimate solution protects the public 
health. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few weeks, a stream of Dundon's supporters and well-wishers -- 
including a member of the Glendale solid waste advisory board, a Glendora 
robotics technician and an Altadena landscaper whose family owns one of the 
largest nurseries in the West -- have helped maintain a vigil on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Documentary film crews are recording the episode. A Los Angeles radio station 
has broadcast its morning show live from the pile. And disc jockeys from cities 
as far flung as Miami and Memphis have made him an on-air novelty. 
</P>
<P>
So, what will Dundon do with all this new-found attention? Get into politics, 
of course. Today he is up for a seat on the Altadena Town Council, a 14-member 
advisory committee that reports to the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to play this thing to the max," Dundon said as a turkey named "Tango" 
gently nudged his leg. "Zeke's heap is now like the whole world. It's not about 
saving this little heap here anymore. It's about saving the whole heap."

HOMELESSNESS STRAINS THE STUDENTS -- AND THE SCHOOLS

<P>
Nine-year-old Maresha Laffoon already knows what she wants out of life. The 
sandy-haired fourth-grader hopes to become a model when she grows up, and "live 
in a big mansion with (her) family." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Maresha's wishes are far more simple. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to stay in one place," she said in a soft voice, tinged with 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Yet nothing has been more elusive. Homeless for more than a year, Maresha and 
her family have moved 13 times in search of shelter. 
</P>
<P>
They have slept on the floor of a church and lived in cheap motels so surly 
that Maresha is afraid to play outside. Instead, she waits until she goes to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really the only time I get to play," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Coeur D'Alene Avenue Elementary School in Venice, which she recently 
attended, Maresha's experience is all too common. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly a third of its 300 students homeless, the school has earned the 
dubious distinction of having the highest student transiency rate in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and administrators there are all too familiar with the problems these 
youths face: from low self-esteem to the lack of adequate health care. That 
makes the job of educating much more challenging, since lessons taught today 
may be unlearned tomorrow as students move from shelter to shelter -- and 
school to school. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week Maresha rejoined that number. 
</P>
<P>
After barely three months, the family had to leave the Venice church where they 
were living and are again searching for shelter. The move means that Maresha 
will enroll in yet another school -- her fourth this academic year. 
</P>
<P>
"She gets into a school, she makes a few friends, she gets comfortable and it's 
off to another school," said Pamela Gains, Maresha's mother, who noted that her 
daughter had adjusted to Coeur D'Alene better than any other school she 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines, her husband and their three children became homeless after work through 
a temporary agency began to slow up and the family could no longer pay the 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
Going to school after school has been painful for Maresha. Sometimes, there are 
fistfights and verbal wars: 
</P>
<P>
"Kids used to tease me because I live (at the shelter). And I said, 'At least I 
have a roof over my head,' " she recalled with soft defiance. 
</P>
<P>
Now the roof over Maresha's head is changing again. And so is her school. 
</P>
<P>
Her abrupt departure from Coeur D'Alene underscores the difficulty of educating 
homeless students even when there is enough money and services available. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not faced at Coeur D'Alene alone: It is a growing and troubling 
phenomenon across the city and nation. The state Department of Education places 
the number of homeless school-age children in greater Los Angeles at 14,000, 
but homeless advocates say it is impossible to obtain an accurate count and the 
number is much higher -- perhaps twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Los Angeles schools are changing. Recently, the school district 
and the California Homeless Coalition co-sponsored the first conference on 
educating homeless youths. Participants discussed ways of improving 
coordination between schools and social service agencies to better serve these 
students. 
</P>
<P>
And the district has changed the residency requirement to make enrollment 
easier for homeless youths, said Jackie Goldberg, school board president and 
keynote speaker at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard first question to every youngster that comes through a public 
school door is, 'Do you have proof of your home address? Did you bring a light 
bill or a water bill?' " Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of requiring these documents, the school board allows homeless parents 
to enroll their children by signing an affidavit that says they are homeless 
but live temporarily in the district. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials also made changes, recently issuing an advisory 
allowing districts to use post office boxes and letters from social workers and 
other documents as proof of residency. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the district, schools with large homeless populations have taken 
steps to help these youths cope. 
</P>
<P>
But the model of how to deal most effectively with the needs of homeless 
students is Coeur D'Alene school, district officials said, where efforts have 
been under way for years. 
</P>
<P>
With a $70,000 grant from the Greater Los Angeles Partnership for the Homeless 
and the support of the school board, Coeur D'Alene has created the Connection 
Project, considered the most comprehensive program for homeless students. Since 
September, the school has had extra counseling and nursing staff and a social 
worker to help meet the educational and social needs of displaced youths and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
The grant for the highly respected project will run out in two months, which 
has sent school officials scrambling to raise money to continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the school held an art sale sponsored by New Yorker magazine and 
the Los Angeles Advertising Club, which featured the work of Coeur D'Alene 
students. It's too soon to tell how much the sale brought in, but Coeur D'Alene 
Principal Beth Ojena said there were "some good contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Other fund-raising activities are planned by parents, teachers and homeless 
advocates who want to keep the program alive for kids like Maresha. 
</P>
<P>
"We desperately need (the program)," said John Ochoa, executive director of the 
Partnership for the Homeless. "This is a very critical program not only for Los 
Angeles, but nationally." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership has financed the Connection Project to show other schools how 
to educate homeless youths, Ochoa said. In the past, the needs of these 
children have gone "unnoticed by districts and shelters." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to ensure that someone is speaking for the children," he said. "They 
didn't cause homelessness but they're on the streets, they're being abused, 
they're malnourished. That's no way to bring up a generation of Americans. The 
public needs to understand that these children do exist." 
</P>
<P>
Ojena, who also is the co-designer of the Connection Project, said many 
homeless students have serious academic deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, homeless students lag two to three years behind their 
classmates. Some miss school because they are embarrassed and feel stigmatized 
by their situation, or because they are constantly moving with their families 
in search of shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these kids will register to as many as nine schools a year," Ochoa 
said. "That is a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Even when the children are in school, basic needs such as health care, clothes 
and food make learning difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz C. Castanon, a psychologist at Coeur D'Alene, said some students come to 
the school with behavioral problems and need counseling to deal with the 
anxiety and stress caused by homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Substance abuse plays a major role, added Jean Gutierrez of Broadway Elementary 
School. Some of the homeless students have been abused or have witnessed 
violent crimes stemming from drug abuse by a relative or others in their 
surroundings, she said. They bring all of these experiences with them to 
school, further complicating behavioral and academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
But Castanon noted that at least some of the problems facing these youths could 
be solved if more money were available. 
</P>
<P>
One student, for example, suffered from an extremely low self-image, Castanon 
said, part of which could have been remedied with a new dress. 
</P>
<P>
"If this little girl had a dress, she would feel 100% better," Castanon said, 
looking at a picture the girl had drawn of herself: a stick figure with a sad 
face dressed in boy-like clothes. When asked to draw a picture of how she 
wanted to look, the girl drew a figure with a happy face in a frilly dress. 
</P>
<P>
Few schools are able to do what Coeur D'Alene does for its homeless students. 
</P>
<P>
The additional school nurse makes referrals for students to receive eyeglasses 
and other health-care needs at no charge, and the school social worker helps 
families obtain other services. In a computer lab donated by the Riordan 
Foundation, the kids learn to read by writing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Connection Project is highly respected, budgetary cuts make it a 
long shot to receive additional financial support from the district, Ojena 
said. Still, the yearlong program has made a difference in the lives of 
homeless students, supporters said, if only for a short time. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel a lot of success and a lot of pride in what is going on here, because 
the kids are happy," Ojena said.

WELD TESTS AT SHELL REFINERY WERE FALSIFIED, COMPANY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A subcontractor admitted Friday that an inexperienced employee falsified the 
results of hardness tests on more than 20 welds on a unit slated to carry 
volatile liquids at the Shell Oil Co. refinery in Carson. The welds are under 
investigation by the state as possibly faulty. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperheat Inc. of Somerset, N.J., the subcontractor doing work for Shell, also 
admitted that the employee was left alone to conduct the tests even though a 
background check had not been completed on him, said Emmett J. Lescroart, 
Cooperheat's chief executive. The employee had been on the job only a couple of 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The employee was subsequently fired when the background check turned up 
questionable information, Lescroart said without going into detail. Cooperheat 
has since changed its policies to avoid a repeat of the problem, Lescroart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health began its probe when 
the same disgruntled employee blew the whistle on the false testing, Lescroart 
said. The employee was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
The admission comes at a time when union officials and other critics are 
questioning the safety of bringing contract workers into refineries to conduct 
routine maintenance work. On Thursday, the Department of Labor promised new 
safety guidelines for refineries in the wake of the explosion at the Phillips 
Petroleum Co. chemical plant in Texas last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials have said that Cal/OSHA investigators tested more than 25 of 
the welds in the Shell refinery and found them to be faulty. Cal/OSHA officials 
have declined to discuss the results of their investigation. The welds were 
made during a routine overhaul of the refinery's coking unit. 
</P>
<P>
The falsifications occurred when the new employee was left alone to conduct 
hardness tests on welds that Cooperheat had "stress relieved," a heating 
process that reduces a weld's brittleness and internal stresses. 
</P>
<P>
When a test showed a result at variance with a desired reading, the employee 
wrote down the desired reading instead of the actual reading, Lescroart said, 
adding that "he didn't grasp the process." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the falsified test results, the welds in question were actually more 
brittle than they were supposed to be. Lescroart denied that the welds were 
"faulty," but admitted that they would have had less flexibility in the event 
of an unusual surge of pressure. Had the employee reported test results 
correctly, the welds could have been treated again. 
</P>
<P>
If Cal/OSHA had not stepped in, Shell's own spot checking would have turned up 
the problem, Lescroart said. "Under no circumstances would these pipes have 
been placed in service without a final verification that all post-weld heat 
treatments had achieved the specified results," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Shell spokesman Mark Singer said Shell's internal testing procedures turned up 
a problem with Cooperheat's test results, though he said there was never a 
question about the welds' integrity. 
</P>
<P>
A second contractor, Brown &amp; Root, which actually made the welds, 
reaffirmed that its own X-rays showed the welds to be good. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the welds in question, Cal/OSHA has "gone over close to 1,000 other 
welds in the Shell refinery, and they've found them all to be OK," said Michael 
Urban, Cooperheat's Western division vice president. "This is being viewed as 
an isolated instance." 
</P>
<P>
Lescroart said the investigation did not signal a wider problem with other 
welds treated or tested by Cooperheat in other Southern California refineries. 
As part of its investigation, Cal/OSHA requested records of work Cooperheat has 
performed at other area refineries, but the investigation has not expanded to 
include other refineries. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the investigation, Cooperheat employees no longer will allowed 
to work until background checks are completed, Urban said. 
</P>
<P>
And new employees will not be left alone to conduct hardness tests, which will 
be left to more experienced technicians, he said.

A 22-year-old man was killed after he fell asleep at the wheel of his car and 
hit a guardrail on the Ventura Freeway in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Castillo was traveling north Thursday on the Ventura Freeway near 
Westlake Boulevard when his car drifted onto the right-hand shoulder of the 
road and hit the guardrail, Officer Randy Klucker of the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, who was not wearing a seat belt, suffered arm fractures, broken ribs 
and internal injuries, Klucker said. He was taken to Westlake Medical Center in 
Westlake Village, where he died shortly afterward, Klucker said. CAROL WATSON

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CITY VIEWS ITS PAST IN NEW LIGHT(S);

<P>
Not content to let bygones be bygones, Fillmore residents are trying to 
recapture the past by installing old-fashioned street lights in the downtown 
business district. 
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to restore the city's once-thriving business district to 
its original turn-of-the century splendor, 23 new lights are being installed in 
a three-block redevelopment district on Central Avenue between Sepse Avenue and 
Highway 126. 
</P>
<P>
Patterned after street lights in downtown Los Angeles in the early part of the 
century, the new lights lend a glow of nostalgia to the city, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm walking back into the time when I was a kid growing up in 
Fillmore," said City Councilman Roger Campbell of the rehabilitated downtown 
area. 
</P>
<P>
But old-fashioned style doesn't come with an old-fashioned price tag. At nearly 
double the cost of standard street lights, the new nostalgic lights are 
expected to cost the city about $50,000 in redevelopment money. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the nostalgic lights are well worth the additional expense. 
"The new street lights make an immeasurable difference," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of redevelopment money, many downtown businesses have restored 
storefronts to their original condition, and the downtown theater marquee has 
been renovated, adding to the overall effect of the downtown area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the the first city in Southern California to buy the replicas of the first 
underground-fed, electrified street lights used in the 1920s, Fillmore is 
breaking new ground in its attempt to recapture the past, said Tom Bradley, 
planning manager of the Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they will now come back into demand again as cities attempt to 
recreate the old Main Street look in their downtown and historic district 
areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the lights that shed a dim glow on city streets of old, the new lights 
use state-of-the-art technology to illuminate roadways, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Manufactured in Fillmore, the nostalgic light fixtures use efficient, 
high-pressure sodium vapor and are twice as bright as many conventional street 
lights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you're stepping into the past a little bit," Bradley said. CAROLYN 
KUSKY

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 INJURED AS RTD BUS RAMS CAR ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A RTD bus slammed into the back of a car on the San Bernardino Freeway in West 
Covina Friday, sending it into a roll and injuring the car's driver and three 
bus passengers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Nick Veronica, 30, of El Monte, was in good condition at Queen of 
the Valley Hospital; the bus passengers were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was westbound when it slammed into the car about 4:55 p.m., a 
spokeswoman for the West Covina Fire Department said. The collision pushed the 
car through a freeway barrier and sent it rolling over several times before 
coming to rest on North Garvey Avenue, parallel to the freeway. Veronica was 
thrown out and trapped under the car until two tow trucks pulled it off of him 
about 5:30 p.m.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 LAWMAKERS PUSH LAW TO CRACK DOWN ON GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two lawmakers entered gang turf in Artesia Friday to promote legislation that 
would make gang members subject to more prosecution under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation introduced Thursday by Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) would 
allow more juvenile gang members to be tried as adults in federal courts for 
crimes such as assaults, shootings and car thefts. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would also mean that a youth could be tried in federal court 
for belonging to a gang whose members have committed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
At the same podium, state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) plugged his proposed 
bill to increase penalties for possession of methamphetamines and PCP. The 
lawmakers said the news conference symbolized the importance of a team approach 
to the gang problem.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL BACKS DOUBLING CAPACITY OF LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles city panel voted Friday to recommend nearly doubling the capacity 
of the controversial Lopez Canyon landfill in Lake View Terrace and setting up 
a $5-million fund for amenities such as parks in the adjacent community. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Public Works endorsed an expansion aimed at reducing the noise and 
unsightliness of the dump by relocating the access road used by city garbage 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials said those revisions would cut into the landfill's 
capacity and shorten its usable life span by several years. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the city-owned facility would allow the number of trucks using 
it every day to increase from 400 to 650 and would extend the working life of 
the dump through the year 2005. The expansion would nearly double the dump's 
capacity to 26 million tons.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO BOOST 'INTEGRITY' OF MINORITY 
PROGRAM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Friday approved a plan aimed at ensuring the 
"integrity" of a program that was designed to aid disadvantaged minorities and 
women but has come under fire for benefitting political insiders. 
</P>
<P>
The council's unanimous vote will force all women-run and minority-owned 
businesses that want to become involved in the city's affirmative-action 
program to first be certified by the Office of Contract Administration, a 
branch of the Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was recommended by two council committees after audits that found 
hefty profits were made by political insiders who appeared to have been 
recruited chiefly for their connections. The insiders included Bishop H.H. 
Brookins, a mentor to Mayor Tom Bradley, Betty Dixon, the wife of U.S. Rep. 
Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), John Mack, head of the Los Angeles chapter of 
the Urban League, and Board of Public Works Commissioner Mylie Evers.

<P>
A yearlong narcotics investigation has culminated in the arrest of a 
40-year-old Ventura man on suspicion of transporting cocaine, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Jeffrey Drettler was arrested at 10:55 a.m. Thursday as he drove along 
Telephone Avenue in Ventura, Ventura police officer Diane McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have suspected for about a year that Drettler was mailing cocaine to 
Hawaii and Alaska, McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
He shipped a package to Sitka, Alaska, on April 19 and it was found to contain 
cocaine, McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
Drettler was being held in the Ventura Jail. Bail was set at $500,000. CAROL

A armed man robbed a gas station in Ventura early Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man approached the cash window at the College Mobile Service Station and 
Market on the 4100 block of Telegraph Road at 3:30 a.m. and demanded money 
after showing a handgun, Officer Bonnie Lucking of the Ventura Police 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman got away with less than $100, Lucking said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman is described as a black male, about 25 years old, about 6 feet tall 
and weighing 160 pounds, Lucking said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman escaped in a mid-sized, two-door blue car, Lucking said. CAROL

A 35-year-old Ventura man was in stable condition Friday after a stranger 
jumped out of a car and shot him after midnight in Ventura, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Louis Speer and his brother, William David Speer, 33, were walking near 
the intersection of North Olive Street and West Harrison Avenue on Friday when 
an unfamiliar car pulled up beside them, said Officer Bonnie Lucking of the 
Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers were on their way to a phone booth because Stanley Speer's house 
in the 300 block of North Olive Street had no phone, said Det. Douglas 
Auldridge of the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
A car pulled alongside them and a man asked the brothers where they lived. They 
replied "Ventura," Lucking said. The man got out of the car and began shooting 
at the brothers with a handgun, Lucking said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Speer was shot twice and fell in the street, Lucking said. William 
David Speer began running when the gunman aimed at him and was not hurt, 
Lucking said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman's car raced from the scene before police arrived, Lucking said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Speer was taken by ambulance to Ventura County Medical Center in 
Ventura, where he was rushed into emergency surgery, Lucking said. He was 
listed in stable condition late Friday, Lucking said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman may have belonged to a gang, Auldridge said. CAROL WATSON

D.A. SAYS SCHOOL'S RAFFLE IS ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A private Catholic high school in Oxnard is seeking new sources of money 
because Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's office declared its annual raffle 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The raffle, held each of the past 20 years at Santa Clara High School's spring 
fiesta, raised about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tuition and fees do not cover the cost of each student," said Sister Anne 
Eugene Metcalf, the school's principal. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday, she said the school would bow to the district 
attorney's opinion and not hold the raffle. It is asking for private donations, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
This year's tuition is $1,700 for Catholic students and $1,850 for 
non-Catholics. The actual cost for each of the about 750 students is $2,300, 
she said, and the raffle has paid the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Metcalf said tuition, which was prepaid earlier this month for next year's 
students, would not be increased to compensate for the loss of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to make new plans for finding other sources of income," she said. 
"We have got to raise that money, and I feel confident that we will come up 
with something else." 
</P>
<P>
In response to protests from parents and school officials, Assemblyman Jack 
O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) introduced legislation Thursday that would place on 
the November ballot an amendment to the state Constitution allowing nonprofit 
and charitable groups to operate raffles. Two previous attempts, in 1988 and 
1989, passed the Assembly but died in the Senate. KIM KASH

AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING 'DATE RAPE' CHARGE AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police and USC officials have opened investigations into an alleged 
"date rape" last December in which a 19-year-old student accused a 21-year-old 
fraternity member of sexual assault, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police questioned both the alleged victim and suspect on Thursday and will turn 
over their findings to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to 
determine whether criminal charges will be filed, Lt. Alan Kerstein of the 
LAPD's Southwest Division said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, denied that sexual 
intercourse had occurred. He was released after questioning. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation -- the subject of the lead story in Friday's edition of the 
Daily Trojan campus newspaper -- will also be reviewed by a disciplinary panel 
made up of students, faculty and administrators, said Jim Dennis, USC's vice 
president of student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth report of a so-called "date rape" or "acquaintance rape" at 
USC since classes began in September, Dennis said, but the first in which the 
alleged victim has filed a formal complaint with police. Police are also 
investigating an alleged rape on campus in which the victim was attacked by a 
stranger in a campus residence hall. 
</P>
<P>
In three previous disciplinary reviews for alleged acquaintance rapes, the 
panel "made findings of what we call harm, or threatening to harm" and ordered 
one-year suspensions of the accused male students, Dennis said. The panel did 
not confirm whether a rape had actually taken place, he said. "It's very 
difficult for a university panel to determine whether a rape had occurred or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
The USC panel, which has the power to expel students, would reach its 
conclusions independent of the police investigation, Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
Kerstein said interviews with the woman, the fraternity member and other 
students indicated that the two had met Dec. 7 at the 901 Club, a saloon near 
the campus. "She indicated that she knew the suspect, had conversed with him in 
the past. There may have been a mild attraction," Kerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman then accompanied him back to a room at the ATO house on Fraternity 
Row, Kerstein said. She told police that when she resisted his advances, he 
overpowered and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
Kerstein said the passage of 4 1/2 months between the incident and the 
allegation made it "impossible" for police to obtain physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The woman attributed the delay in notifying authorities to emotional trauma.

$1.1-MILLION LOAN IS OKD FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Friday approved a $1.1-million loan for a controversial 
Northeast Los Angeles housing development in what could be a series of battles 
pitting single-family neighborhoods against government-funded affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75 placard-carrying residents of the Hillside Village neighborhood 
appeared before the council to complain that development of the site, which is 
zoned for at least 85 rental units, could harm the fabric of their Lincoln Park 
area neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a destructional force in our community," said homeowner John Lucero. 
"You are destroying us." 
</P>
<P>
Council members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina, backed by Mayor Tom 
Bradley's housing coordinator Michael Bodaken, countered that communities 
across the city must begin biting the bullet and accept new housing projects 
for the city to ease its escalating affordable housing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't intend to terrorize the neighborhood," said Alatorre, "but to provide 
housing for those in need." 
</P>
<P>
Bodaken praised the Eastside council members, saying: "If affordable housing 
will be developed in this city in the next three years . . . each community 
will have to address (this)." 
</P>
<P>
Further fights are expected as the Community Redevelopment Agency, long 
criticized for providing little more than lip service toward affordable 
housing, becomes increasingly involved in the effort. In recent months, the CRA 
has given starter loans for seven such projects, including ones near downtown 
and in Sun Valley, Southwest Los Angeles and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 11 to 1 to grant the $1.1-million CRA loan for a development 
on the 4300 block of East Hatfield Place, planned by Charo Community and Human 
Resources Inc., a 25-year-old nonprofit agency that also operates workshops for 
the handicapped. Charo had already received a CRA loan of $1.03 million, but 
needed the additional funds to finish buying the property and have designs 
drawn that will help determine the number of housing units. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores questioned the decision to 
purchase the property before agreeing on the project's scope. But when a vote 
was taken, only Councilman Ernani Bernardi opposed the measure.

5 WHO HELPED BRING CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE CITED;

During the early morning one day last December, two construction workers were 
in hot pursuit of a hit-and-run driver who had just killed a 78-year-old woman 
as she and her husband crossed an Oceanside street. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Parada y Maldonado and Charles Long were on their way to work in a 
truck when Maldonado saw the woman hurled into the air by the hit-and-run 
driver's car. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado did the only thing he could do -- he turned his truck around and 
chased the car, while Long called the police on a the truck's telephone. 
</P>
<P>
They chased the man, Richard Santillan, to a cul-de-sac about 2 miles away. 
When they finally reached him, they saw him toss several beer bottles from his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado said they both told Santillan to go back to the scene. To their 
relief, Santillan agreed to return. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared," Maldonado said Friday. "I was shaking, and I didn't realize it 
until we went back to where the accident happened." 
</P>
<P>
Santillan, 23, an illegal alien who had lost his license as the result of an 
earlier hit-and-run accident, was later sentenced to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado and Long have been named Good Samaritans by the San Diego County 
district attorney and were among those honored Friday at the third annual 
District Attorney's Crime Victims Luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the others who received words of praise from Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller 
were ordinary people who became victims of crimes. The crimes pushed them to 
the limits of emotional endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Clark was a rape victim who had to endure the threats and taunts of 
classmates at Monte Vista High School in Spring Valley when she testified 
against two very popular boys who raped her on an April night two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Her attackers, Tim Clay, now 20, and Courtney Hallman, now 21, were sentenced, 
respectively, to six and three years in jail. They were 1987 Monte Vista 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Robertson was abducted in 1984 by serial killer David Allen Lucas. He 
slit her throat and left her to die. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle that she is alive," Miller said. He praised her tremendous 
spirit for "simply living" after her throat was cut. And he lauded Robertson's 
endurance -- because she had to relive the attack seven times on the witness 
stand during Lucas' trial. In September, Lucas was convicted of three murders 
and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson thanked Miller and added that she could not have endured the ordeal 
without the support of her family and the prosecuting attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Minnifield had similar praise for Miller and his staff. Minnifield's 
2-year-old daughter was beaten to death and stuffed into a trash bin in El 
Cajon in 1988 by Matthew LeSure. 
</P>
<P>
Minnifield and LeSure had been living together. 
</P>
<P>
LeSure was convicted last year, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, 
after Minnifield and her 7-year-old son, Derwin Anderson, testified against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In a tearful voice, Minnifield thanked Miller's staff and her family "for 
helping me to stay strong." 
</P>
<P>
Miller also singled out two organizations that work within the criminal justice 
system to ease the pain of crime victims and to help them wend their way 
through the criminal justice system . 
</P>
<P>
One is the Crisis Intervention Program, whose volunteers counsel victims of 
crime, most often violent ones, in those first moments of trauma. The other is 
the Domestic Violence Prevention Project, which since February, 1989, has 
helped more than 6,000 victims of domestic violence obtain temporary 
restraining orders against their abusers. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he hoped that the recognition of the people and the organizations 
would enable the public to understand the problems of victims -- the trauma of 
crime and the frustration brought about by delays in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that we can do to ease the pain. . . . It's very emotional for me. 
I'd like the public to know the problems they encounter," Miller said.

<P>
A 43-year-old Oxnard woman died when her 16-year-old daughter, who was driving 
their car, took her eyes off the road and drifted into oncoming traffic, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Felicia Torres was driving her mother, Alicia Rodriguez, westbound on Pleasant 
Valley Road near Hailes Road when she glanced away to reach for her purse, said 
Officer Randy Klucker of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The car drifted into oncoming traffic and collided head-on with a car driven by 
Darel McCauley, 36, of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The three occupants of the two cars were taken by ambulance to St. John's 
Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, where Rodriguez died, Klucker said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres and McCauley were treated and released, said Nancy Johnson, a hospital 
spokeswoman.

Society's current environmental consciousness is proof again that the American 
liberal political agenda is decades ahead of its time. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals were promoting environmentalism 30 years ago, when the status quo 
labeled them as "loonies." In fact, liberals throughout history have 
consistently promoted causes and issues that eventually became part of the 
American mainstream. Racial and sexual equality, opposition to the Vietnam War 
and warnings over the dangers of nuclear power are only some of the issues 
initially championed by liberals. 
</P>
<P>
So take heart, liberals, your cause today will become the norm of political 
thought tomorrow.

William Schneider's Earth Day column stated that President Bush is proclaiming 
the environmental cause as his own (Opinion, April 22). There is, 
unfortunately, a sizeable gap between the proclamation and performance. 
</P>
<P>
The present Administration has insisted upon weakening the Clean Air Act in 
spite of the overwhelming support of the American people for environmental 
protection. It was reported in The Times that the President is now expected to 
approve oil drilling off the California coast (Part A, April 23). In a speech 
last week he asked for more study as his response to the global warming threat. 
These are hardly the bold, decisive actions one might expect from an 
environmentalist leader. 
</P>
<P>
Wishing will not make President Bush an environmentalist nor will talking. Only 
action will make it so.

THE SYMBOLISM WAS ALL WRONG; 
</P>
<P>
WHY THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE OCCUPATION OF 
THE HOSPICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel's supreme court has upheld a lower court order evicting the 150 Jewish 
religious zealots who moved into St. John's Hospice in the Christian Quarter of 
Jerusalem during Easter Week. Now it's up to a lower court to decide on the 
validity of the lease under which the settlers had occupied the four-building 
complex. Whatever that ruling, the damage done to Israel by this provocative 
act, ranging from freshly embittered relations between Jews and non-Jews in 
Jerusalem to the very credibility of its top leaders, is far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
On April 11, just before Good Friday, 20 Jewish families moved into the 
hospice, a 72-room complex owned by the Greek Orthodox Church. The settlers 
said they had paid $4 million to sublease the Old City facility, dealing with 
its Armenian Christian tenant through a Panama-based front company. They 
further claimed that their action was simply meant to assert the right of Jews 
to live anywhere in Israel, even, presumably, within the walls of a structure 
historically and unequivocally associated with a major Christian denomination. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, their takeover was a demonstration of disregard for the religious 
sensitivities of others. Predictably, noisy and violent protests followed. 
Mayor Teddy Kollek, who for decades has labored to ease religious tensions in 
Jerusalem, was among the first to deplore the settlers' action. 
</P>
<P>
The settlers clearly intended to make a political statement as much as a 
religious one. In time it emerged that they had been encouraged by Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's caretaker government. After first denying any 
involvement with the settlers, the government finally conceded that the Finance 
Ministry -- which is now under Shamir's control -- had contributed $1.8 million 
toward the lease. The Shamir regime was thus caught lying to the Israeli 
public. It also sought to mislead the United States, whose Congress is now 
pondering a $400-million loan guarantee to settle Soviet immigrants in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
To their considerable credit, the leaders of many major American Jewish 
organizations that have usually been reluctant to openly criticize Israeli 
government actions this time have done so with unambiguous condemnation. But 
the damage already done goes unrepaired. Shamir could have prevented it. The 
responsibility for what has happened is his, above all, to bear.

The article by Kennedy is an example of the pathetic Pollyanna attitude that 
threatens to reduce the environmental movement to a media circus destined to 
quickly fade in deference to big business-as-usual. Earth First! should be 
applauded, not chided, for standing up to the vested interests and refusing to 
compromise the integrity of our remaining wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
It takes political and personal courage to chain oneself to a bulldozer or to 
physically block huge logging trucks in an effort to prevent further 
clear-cutting. The object of actions such as tree spiking is to protect 
forests, not injure loggers. Spiked trees are painted with large "S" as a 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud the more diplomatic efforts of Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and other 
mainstream environmental groups, but the question must be asked: "What have 
they really accomplished in the 20 years since the last Earth Day?" A series of 
politically palatable compromises and small victories designed by politicians 
and industry to pacify the public are all we have to show. The global 
environmental situation continues to worsen despite the well-intentioned 
efforts of these groups. Enough talk, Mr. Kennedy. It's time we put the Earth 
First!

EARTH DAY FOCUSES ATTENTION ON DETERIORATION OF ENVIRONMENT

On Sunday we celebrated Earth Day. This day was to remind all of us that we 
must do something to save our planet from destruction, perhaps by recycling 
cans, plastics, glass. 
</P>
<P>
In general, do not pollute. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning I went out to get my paper and to my surprise found The 
Times wrapped in a large plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
How can we save our world when large corporations, such as The Times, keep 
right on polluting? How many thousands of these bags will be found in landfills 
waiting hundreds of years to decompose?

It was interesting to read such an optimistic view of institutionalized 
religion's effectiveness in supporting environmental issues ("Religions Join 
the Crusade to Save Earth," Part A, April 19). 
</P>
<P>
The inescapable problem remains, however, that as long as a significant number 
of human beings believe they are the only privileged species created in God's 
image and therefore capable of "salvation," passages like Genesis 1:28 will 
remain the tacit basis for modern Western civilization's destruction of the 
interdependent web of life on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the difference between "dominion" in this verse and implied "stewardship" 
in Genesis 2:15 is only one of degree . . . both are rooted in the shortsighted 
notion of human superiority ordained by a human-centered God. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the human population is expanding at the unprecedented rate of 
nearly 1 billion every 10 years, shoving into extinction one-third of all 
species within the next 20 to 30 years. Yet the impact of organized religion 
has been one of the strongest barriers to massive global family planning 
efforts, the only solution to our successful cohabitation of the planet with 
God's other creations. Be assured that the result of the Earth Day L.A. 
Population Task Force mailing to 5,400 area churches was far different from the 
other responses reported.

LITHUANIA'S STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our government leaders seem to be convinced that it is imperative to sacrifice 
the freedom of the Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- for the 
possible good of the long-term relationship between the two superpowers: the 
Soviet Union and the United States. But we must be cautious that the good not 
be one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
We must be cautious that our naivete in understanding the Russian way of 
thinking does not serve to further only the good of the crumbling economy of 
the Soviet Union at a very high cost to the American taxpayer. Unless the 
Soviet Union gets our technology for virtually nothing and some very favorable 
trade agreements as well with the U.S., the Soviet Union is doomed to become a 
Third World country economically, and the Soviet leaders know it. 
</P>
<P>
They also need the more industrious and skilled Baltic republics in the same 
manner that the old grand South needed the slaves. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has never been too proud to respond to pressure. Our pressure for the 
Baltic independence should be unrelenting. Taking a neutral position between 
freedom and tyranny corrupts our own values.

I must take issue with Konner's specious reasoning. He comes to the conclusion 
that "the likely result of contact is the most grotesque disaster that has ever 
befallen our species," the disaster being something on the order of what we 
humans have perpetrated upon animals within the melee of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Konner assumes, therefore, that if we were to send messages to the stars, the 
likely consequence would be that the listeners would dispatch ships to come to 
Earth and enslave us or kill us all. 
</P>
<P>
His conclusion is derived from the assumptions that: Aliens have evolved 
exactly as we have; we represent a threat to their evolutional integrity, and 
they will conclude that the logical response is to come trillions of miles 
across space to deal with this threat. I hope people see this commentary for 
what it is -- misleading and ludicrous.

As one of the participants in the April 11 White House conference with 
Baltic-American leaders, my impressions were somewhat different from those 
conveyed by your story of April 12 (Part A). 
</P>
<P>
The meeting itself was a signal that the Bush Administration is seriously 
considering various options that go beyond present rhetoric in responding to 
Soviet escalation of the Baltic situation. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Secretary of State James Baker, National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu attended the meeting along 
with President Bush helped emphasize this. The further fact that a meeting 
which was scheduled to last half an hour continued for more than an hour 
indicated that the proposals which were made were not dismissed out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the Baltic delegation expected President Bush to announce a major 
policy shift based on our discussions. What we hoped for and received was the 
President's unequivocal endorsement of the right of the people of Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania for self-determination. We also received an invitation to 
continue providing input into the Administration's Baltic policy 
decision-making process.

It's fascinating to watch the Bush Administration's reaction to the Soviet 
Union's embargo against Lithuania. Maybe we'll go full circle; the World Court 
can condemn this action and then the Soviets can defy that body, just as the 
United States defied the court's condemnation of our embargo of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
We've been trying for years to redesign the Soviet Union in our image, and it 
seems we have made a start. So far the Soviets haven't mined Lithuania's 
harbors as we did Nicaragua's, nor organized a Contra-style terrorist force to 
conduct hit-and-run raids across the border. Perhaps the Soviet Union will 
follow our example all the way and put up its own hand-picked slate in the next 
Lithuanian election and then spend millions to support that slate. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it great that the world is finally following our example?

FIRE NO LONGER KEEPS THE BEAST AT BAY;

INDIANS: IN TIMES PAST, THE PREDATORS WITHIN A MAN WOULD BE TAMED BY SONGS. NOW

There was a moment in which he knew he could not go on. But the moment passed,

to the shadow and ran beyond his pain.

<P>
 -- N. Scott Momaday, "House Made of Dawn" 
</P>
<P>
Sometime last April, the spirits left the body of William Smith along Highway 
33, about 25 miles north of Ojai. Smitty was a Shoshone Indian from Fort Hall, 
Ida., and his body is buried there. But the spirits he collected during his 
lifetime should also be put to rest, as is customary, one year after his death. 
</P>
<P>
Born in California on April 18, 1955, to a relocated Shoshone woman from Idaho 
and an absent white father, Smitty died homeless, caught like a shadow between 
two worlds, Indian and white. Most Americans know and accept Indians only if 
they are feather-bedecked caricatures: "redskins" and "braves" who bear 
Hollywood names like Tonto and Iron Eyes and do fine as targets for John 
Wayne's hundred-round six-shooter. American guilt can, to a certain extent, be 
assuaged of the theft of native land and resources by painting Indians as 
aboriginal oddities in the realm of natural history rather than human history. 
William Smith was none of these. He was a son, a father, a brother, a friend, 
and an Indian homeless in his own land. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, Smitty's mother found her way back to the reservation and 
he grew up along the banks of the Snake River. Like most Indian reservations, 
Fort Hall is an island of absolute poverty in the midst of awesome beauty. Like 
most boys, Smitty was interested in baseball and fishing, and like most 
Indians, he dropped out of school and learned a trade. 
</P>
<P>
In past times, the native people marked the transition from child to adult with 
a solitary stint in the womb of the earth mother. There they would seek out the 
sacred names for predatory animals born into each human soul and shape the 
animal spirit's energy into the cycles of all life. Nowadays, when the animals 
awaken, there are no prayers. There is alcohol, and while it dulls the roar, it 
also sharpens the claws and teeth until a beast is born that can rip the soul 
to shreds. And so it was with Smitty. 
</P>
<P>
Crime on an Indian reservation is a federal offense, and when the drunken spree 
was over, Smitty was sent to a cell in Lompoc, less than a hundred miles from 
his place of birth. Smitty was a short-timer, and was soon back on the streets. 
He struggled with the beast, praying hard to hear its name, and for a time his 
artwork and Indian singing kept the claws at bay. I remember his clear sweet 
voice beside me in the sweat lodge, a place that Smitty sought out time and 
again. There used to be lots of sweats around Southern California and Smitty 
went to many. But the twin threats of pseudo-shamans and their new-age 
supporters drove the sweats underground. And instead of the warm caress of 
steam to still the beast he carried, Smitty poured poison down his throat. 
</P>
<P>
In and out of jail a hundred times or more, and no one in the system could find 
the name to call the beast growing inside Smitty. What had been an animal of 
altruistic potential was now a monster who could only be tamed by ancient songs 
and ceremonies. But many of the healing songs have died with the old ones, 
stuck to their tongues, frozen there by the pilgrims who are only now wanting 
to hear them, and steal them, like they did the land. 
</P>
<P>
When Smitty's body could no longer absorb the alcohol, he tricked the monster 
to sleep with a heroin assault. But the beast was tired, and angry, and hungry 
for the songs that Smitty could no longer sing, for the fire that kept the 
beast at bay also burned Smitty's throat until his voice cracked like dry 
leaves underfoot. Since the songs the beast craved are born of the wind in the 
language of the birds and four-leggeds, it was in their land, high up a 
twisting canyon road, that the beast left the body of William Smith. No one was 
there to see it, but Indians in the Americas know too well what happened; this 
horror is familiar to us all. 
</P>
<P>
The last time we saw Smitty, the beast was searching for a place for him to 
die. And finally that happened, under some chaparral. Smitty's clothes were 
strung out along the hill where the beast tore away the only things left that 
looked human about the body of William Smith. In the last moments of struggle, 
Smitty could not have sung his death song, for by then the chords were burned 
like sticks to rattle in his throat. 
</P>
<P>
There are other beasts, thousands of them, loose in the bodies of Indians who 
can be healed only with ceremonies that can no longer be learned. For the wind 
creates no songs against square stones and metal. And the lyrics of the birds 
and four-leggeds are closed out with walls, or caged away. But I know that 
there are still some songs being tended like small warm fires, here and there, 
in sweat lodges. May one of them at this time be sung for the spirits of 
William Smith.

HE WANTS SCULLY TO BE VINDICATED

<P>
Dan York of Laguna Hills (Viewpoint, April 21) could not possibly be talking 
about the Vin Scully I and many others grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been often honored, I think that many still take Scully for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
It is not enough to say that he is the best baseball broadcaster who ever sat 
behind the plate. Those of us who have lived with the company of Dodger radio 
broadcasts, while doing homework, driving in rush-hour traffic or just 
daydreaming at the beach, know how Vin Scully has touched our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Please, Vin, don't ever stop describing that high drive to deep left field. I 
still want to hear about Davis going back, awaaaay back, to the wall. And for 
as long as you can, I want you to tell me it's gone.

Where does Mr. Stern draw the line when deciding where a team is putting forth 
its best lineup? How many minutes must each starter play? Will he also decide 
whether each player is giving his best effort? If Mr. Stern is going to hand 
out fines for coaching decisions, he should explicitly state the rules, and not 
leave it up to the coach to divine the league's vague expectations.

BOWERY DOES ITS BEST TO BOLSTER A THIN 'JESSE, BANDIT QUEEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The best thing about "Jesse and the Bandit Queen" at the Bowery Theatre is the 
San Diego debut of actor Patrick Egan. 
</P>
<P>
That Egan manages to breathe life into playwright David Freeman's cartoonish 
conception of Jesse James is remarkable. His secret seems to be keeping it 
simple; his Jesse isn't too bright. Thus, even without too much insight or 
explication on the part of the playwright, Egan subtly persuades the audience 
that, yes, it could have happened that a man like Jesse might have begun as a 
Confederate soldier taking out his frustration at the loss of the Civil War on 
everyone he perceived to be as Union sympathizers -- even to the point of 
raping a little girl whom he rationalizes might have grown up to espouse the 
Union cause. 
</P>
<P>
If only Freeman cared more about how and why this historical character did what 
he did. Instead, he seems awed by James' fame -- romanticizing him as if fame 
justified the crimes. And because he is so intrigued by celebrity, rather than 
truth, he pairs James with Belle Starr in this two-person play. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a television sitcom writer's classic scenario: These two famous 
outlaws probably never met, but if they did, wouldn't it be a neat show? 
</P>
<P>
Well, no, not really. Not judging from "Jesse and the Bandit Queen." And 
especially not in the light of the fine work done on the film "Bonnie and 
Clyde," in which you feel the force of the characters' frustrations, fears and 
insecurities. You see the ugly side of crime, not this romantic blur in which 
every one of Starr's accusations of James' sadism ends in an embrace. 
</P>
<P>
The most problematic part in this highly problematic play falls in the lap of 
Mickey Mullany as Starr. It's one of those parts that looks better than it is; 
the actress gets to be on stage a lot and play a variety of emotions -- from 
anger to seduction to longing to love. But there is no internal emotional sense 
to the character, no clue as to what makes her tick. 
</P>
<P>
Instead we get a curious mix of psychosexual babble in which Starr wants to be 
Jesse and wear his clothes and do his deeds with him. Not for any particular 
reason; it's just that Freeman has swallowed Freud's theory about women wanting 
to be men, hook, line and sinker. 
</P>
<P>
And sink this show does, despite some cleverness of construction -- the play is 
written in a series of vignettes in which James and Starr both play a variety 
of characters in each other's lives, including Belle's horse, Venus. That the 
show has its moments is a credit to the high standards of the Bowery Theatre, 
which give this script a better production than it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie Nash directs with a boldly visual style that elicits sparks -- there 
would have been a fire if he only had a script that worked with him and not 
against him. The set design by John Blunt and Bowery artistic director Ralph 
Elias is a lovely, suggestive scene torn out of the pages of a Wild West movie, 
with log cabin walls, dry brush and a simple white screen, nicely washed by 
Kris Sabel's subtle lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Dione Lebhar's costumes are richly detailed; the heavy ruffles and striking 
designs for Starr are enticing, though it is hard to imagine her rustling 
cattle and horses in such heavy clothing. The sound design by Lawrence Czoka 
sets a nostalgic Western mood -- easy on the ear, but again, oddly gentle in 
light of some of the cold-blooded deeds being described. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was too much to expect for the Bowery, which had three hit shows in 
a row, to end its season with a bang. Still, one can't help being wistful about 
the theater closing "Teibele and Her Demon" -- which played to sell-out crowds 
-- just so it would have time to present this one before season's end. If not 
for providing a stage for Egan's debut, this really would have been a waste of 
talent and time. 
</P>

OPINIONS ON WHY PRIME-TIME VIEWERSHIP HAS DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Number of Viewers Watching Prime-Time Television Drops," April 18: 
</P>
<P>
I am impressed by the level of restraint demonstrated by staff writer Jane 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Since I am no longer a highly paid television production executive, I can tell 
you why the number of viewers watching prime-time television has dropped. In 
spite of the marvelous televisionese spouted by the executives quoted in the 
article, the real reasons are: (1) stupid, inane, copycat programming and (2) 
too many commercials! 
</P>
<P>
There, now that wasn't so difficult, was it? . . .

BLACK WRITERS OF SOAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take exception to George Blaine Jr.'s April 7 letter concerning finding black 
writers for the NBC soap "Generations." Blaine seems to assume this should be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Call the Writers Guild," he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
That's the problem. Call the Writers Guild and they will tell you -- there are 
no black writers in daytime TV. 
</P>
<P>
When "Generations" became the first soap to establish a central black family, 
head writer Sally Sussman felt it was essential to include black writers on her 
staff. Finding them wasn't easy. Even experienced writers have trouble adapting 
to soaps. It's unlike writing for anything else, and it's relentless. Writers 
turn out five scripts a week -- 52 weeks a year. The scripts are 90% dialogue, 
and they require working from another writer's outline -- a major adjustment 
for any writer. 
</P>
<P>
"Generations" is lucky enough to have two terrific black writers. Hopefully 
there will be more. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the group at NBC Productions has made every effort to provide 
jobs for blacks in every field. Just this year, under the aegis of the Writers 
Guild of America, "Generations" established a minority writers program to 
create more opportunities for black writers, addressing just this problem. And 
this month NBC, in association with the National Negro College Fund, instituted 
the "Generations" Scholarship, for young blacks interested in pursuing a career 
in the arts.

MAKING ROCK VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Willman's April 14 "Videos That Missed the Point" showed he has not even 
the slightest knowledge about the workings of the music video business. 
</P>
<P>
His assertion that rock video directors "misunderstand or misrepresent the true 
content" of songs is an insult to the artists, recording executives and all of 
us in the music video industry. 
</P>
<P>
Let me explain: 
</P>
<P>
The artist, management or the record label names a director and submits the 
track and any guidelines that may apply (concept vs. performance, budget, 
etc.). 
</P>
<P>
The director writes a treatment, and after discussions among artist, director 
and the record company, a final treatment is agreed on. Once approval is 
reached on the budget, the label issues a contract. Only then does the 
production company make the video. 
</P>
<P>
Then when the artist and record company approve the video -- the contract 
stipulates that they have "creative control" -- they distribute it for airplay. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, directors are not the autonomous, omnipotent villains.

KEATING'S YOUTHFUL ZEAL AGAINST PORN, OBSCENITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had a hearty laugh when I read ("Mapplethorpe Show Bumps Into a City's Legacy 
of Conformity" by David Wells, Calendar, April 23) that Charles Keating, as a 
young Cincinnati attorney full of religious zeal, founded Citizens for Decent 
Literature and was later appointed by President Nixon to the Federal Commission 
on Obscenity and Pornography. The obscene greed displayed in the S&amp;L 
scandals is beginning to make sense.

SIBERRY DOWNSHIFTS CRISPLY INTO FOLK AT COACH HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
THE CANADIAN SINGER'S SIMPLER, MORE DIRECT APPROACH TO MUSIC MAKES FOR AN 
INTIMATE CONCERT.

Chalk up one more reason to be thankful that it's cool to be a folkie again: We 
now get to hear Jane Siberry set aside her labyrinthine abstractions and 
explore songs that are simple and rewarding, not to mention far more 
comprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Siberry has taken note of the success of the Tracy Chapman/Cowboy Junkies 
folk-based class of '88-'89. Or maybe she simply concluded that she 
accomplished what she had set out to with the sprawling song-structures and 
puzzling symbolism that dominated her albums "The Speckless Sky" (1985) and 
"The Walking" (1988). 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the direct, folk-based material from the Canadian singer's strong 
current album, "Bound by the Beauty," formed the basis for an exceptionally 
warm and intimate concert Thursday night at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
Siberry, who in the past has toured with a seven-member ensemble featuring 
backup singer-dancers, has pared her act to the elemental stuff: just herself 
on guitars, tambourine and a few bars of accordion, aided by two fine 
accompanists, guitarist Ken Myhr and piano/accordionist Teddy Borowiecki. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to their contributions and Siberry's ability to range from sheer whimsy 
to utter heartbreak, the nearly two-hour show never lacked variety or 
inventiveness. Only one song, "Bound by the Beauty," sounded undernourished 
without a rhythm section. 
</P>
<P>
Siberry signaled from the start that she is on a new tack. Playing for a small 
but rapt audience that seemed to be made up of committed fans, she began with 
Tom Waits' open-hearted "Train Song," singing with a tawny warmth reminiscent 
of Bonnie Raitt. For most of the concert, however, Siberry stayed in a higher, 
more ethereal range that recalled Joni Mitchell. Like Mitchell, Siberry 
frequently sang in unpredictable harmonic steps that skirted folk-pop 
convention, and lent her singing a sense of surprise and fragile mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Siberry sang all of the "Bound by the Beauty" album, adding only one song from 
each of her three previous U.S. releases. Only one of those older songs, "Mimi 
on the Beach," was an example of Siberry's epic mode, and it is her most 
accessible magnum opus at that. Even so, she abridged "Mimi" considerably and 
leavened it with a healthy instrumental slice of "Georgy Girl," as if to show 
anyone who had her pegged as a deliberately obscure artiste that some 
re-evaluation now is in order. 
</P>
<P>
Myhr (pronounced "mire") has been a longtime sidekick of Siberry's. At the 
Coach House, he could almost have been a band unto himself. His arsenal 
included hard-edged acoustic slide guitar blues, atmospheric electronic 
effects, breezy Spanish guitar and even some tongue-in-cheek arena-rock hero 
licks during the joking finale, "Miss Punta Blanca." Myhr also sang a taut 
desperado blues, "Bruce's Song," that recalled the Neville Brothers' eloquently 
spare arrangement of Bob Dylan's "Ballad of Hollis Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Siberry's set moved along with sure pacing and intelligent juxtapositions of 
mood and theme. At mid-set, for example, she paired two of her loveliest songs: 
"The Walking," a hushed meditation on the pain of a romantic breakup, was 
followed by "The Life Is the Red Wagon," a swelling affirmation of hope and 
love. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's finest song was a new, unreleased number, "Calling All Angels." 
In this country-folk tune, the protagonist is caught up in the first fearsome, 
intoxicating moments of a crush that is both utterly romantic and ragingly 
libidinous. It's a number that Emmylou Harris or Linda Ronstadt probably 
wouldn't mind having if they could get their hands on it, but Siberry's sexy 
and plaintive reading did it full justice. 
</P>
<P>
Siberry kept between-song chats in check, but she and her band mates managed to 
loosen the mood with playful asides (including shutterbugging each other and 
the audience with a camera that Siberry brought on stage). The trio's 
comfortable interaction added to the show's sense of warmth. The intimacy and 
detailed playing of Siberry's concert rivaled that of Cowboy Junkies, those 
younger upstarts from her hometown of Toronto. But the energy, stylistic range 
and dynamic variations of Siberry's show far exceeded what the ever-nodding 
Junkies have shown to date.

<P>
I've just read the April 13 review of "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &amp; Her 
Lover" ("Cook": Grossness From Great Talents") in which Kevin Thomas calls the 
film "repulsive," with scenes of cannibalism and of a man smeared with 
excrement. Quick! Call the National Endowment for the Arts! I'm sure it will 
want to sponsor the sequel in the name of artistic freedom!

"TWISTER"(U.S., 1989; Director: Michael Almereyda; Century Plaza, 4:15 p.m.). A 
strange and altogether fascinating comedy from writer-director Almereyda, his 
directorial debut. It's about a screw-loose Kansas family, and the cast is 
assembled like prize specimens in a zoo. Crispin Glover's performance is one of 
the great wacko characterizations in film. (P.R.)

"THE END OF OLD TIMES"(Czechoslovakia, 1989; Director: Jiri Menzel; Fairfax, 
6:30 p.m.). Menzel's distinctively humanist slapstick is only partially on view 
in this moderately engaging comedy about a man posing as an aristocrat among 
the hunting-party set in post-World War I Czechoslovakia. (Peter Rainer)

"KILLER OF SHEEP"(U.S., 1979; Director: Charles Burnett; AFI Mark Goodson, 2 
p.m.). This was the film that revealed Charles Burnett as one of our shy, 
stubborn poets, finding beauty and even hope in the rubble of the inner city. 
See this, which Burnett shot as well as produced, wrote and directed, for its 
remarkable performances, particularly Harry Gale Sanders, for its beauty, 
flashes of wit and amazing tensile strength. (Sheila Benson)

"LARKS ON A STRING"(Czechoslovakia, 1969; Director: Jiri Menzel; Fairfax, 8:45 
p.m.). The most famous banned film in the Hollywood Glasnost section, "Larks" 
surfaced after two decades to share the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film 
Festival. I prefer it to his 1966 Oscar-winner, "Closely Watched Trains." 
Deceptively light and sunny, buoyant and dangerously lyrical, it's a romantic 
comedy about a group of bourgeois Czechs and their postwar political 
re-education in a wildly picturesque scrapheap. It's a movie that sings.

"LADDER OF SWORDS"(Great Britain, 1989; Director: Norman Hull; Century Plaza, 
6:45 p.m.). A husband-wife circus act on the skids in the British moors may not 
sound like a promising premise for a movie, but this debut feature is 
engagingly scruffy. The wayward lives it depicts are viewed without 
condescension. (Peter Rainer)

"A BETTER TOMORROW: THE TRILOGY "(Hong Kong, 1986; Directors: John Woo, Tsui 
Hark; Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza, 4:30, 9 and 11:15 p.m.). A slam-bang 
contemporary Hong Kong action trilogy -- about brothers on opposite sides of 
the law, and a swaggering buddy (flirtatious Chow Yunn-fatt), warring with 
various bands of vile gangsters. Coincidences and mass carnage abound. Part I 
pops with energy, light satire and full-blown emotionalism. The unrecommended 
Part II is thin, brutal, conventionally shot. The unscreened Part III -- with 
producer Tsui Hark ("Peking Opera Blues" taking over direction -- might be the 
best of the bunch. (Michael Wilmington)

"THE AGITATORS"(Hungary, 1969; Director: Deszo Magyar; Fairfax, 6:45 p.m.). In 
this brilliant, hurtling portrayal of the abortive 1919 Hungarian rebellion, 
Magyar sees the past through a contemporary '60s prism: his young 
revolutionaries fulminate, rage, scream and slice each other's dialectics to 
shreds -- caught by a restless camera and slashing, propulsive editing.

"THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PARKING LOTS"(U.S., 1990; Director: Everett Lewis; AFI 
Mark Goodson, 9 p.m.). The horror stories of privileged throw-away kids, 
considered disposable by new stepparents, gave writer/director Lewis the spine 
of his story. From these, he's created a breathtaking breakthrough film, made 
with the urgency one finds in works of the French New Wave. This one has 
poetry, irony, compassion, eroticism, beauty, a Bresson-like purity, excellent 
acting and slyly great music. (Sheila Benson)

GANG BLOODSHED CONTINUES IN NEW RASH OF SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an overnight spate of unrelated street violence, a 7-month-old boy, his 
20-year-old father, a pregnant teen-ager, a 16-year-old boy, a young Pomona man 
and a schoolgirl from Highland Park all fell victims to gunfire on Los Angeles 
County streets, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs were said to be responsible for all of the attacks. There were no 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the victims died. They were Jesus Gonzales, 18, gunned down as he sat 
with David John Godinez Sr. and Godinez's infant son, David John Jr., on a wall 
in their Pomona neighborhood; the pregnant girl, Camille Pena, 16, shot on a 
sidewalk in the Florence area, and 16-year-old Frank Langston, slain as he was 
using a pay phone near the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
While there have been bloodier nights in greater Los Angeles -- weekends have 
become notorious for double-digit body counts -- the shootings Thursday night 
and early Friday seemed to claim an extraordinarily young collection of 
victims. Also, they added significantly to what already has been a dramatic 
increase in gang-related violence over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department said there were 1,302 gang-related violent felonies 
countywide, ranging from homicides to drive-by shootings, between Jan. 1 and 
March 31. That compares to 1,099 such crimes in the same period last year -- an 
18% increase. Similarly, the department reported 35 gang-related murders in the 
first quarter of this year, 10 more than during the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials attributed the increase to a general surge in gang 
activity, especially in Latino communities. Some authorities also suggested 
that gang members, unable to find jobs, may be remaining active longer than in 
past years. More gang members means more gang violence. Tactics, too, have 
changed, leading to more innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, gangs used to fight one-on-one," said Sheriff's Sgt. Joe 
Guzman, supervisor of gang investigators at the department's East Los Angeles 
station. "Now, it's all about weapons, guns, cars and quick getaways." 
</P>
<P>
This is common knowledge on certain streets in Los Angeles and its surrounding 
cities. One witness to the death of the pregnant girl -- a 27-year-old man who 
identified himself only as "Easy Money" -- was unfazed by the gang violence, 
which he said is common in the unincorporated community of Florence. 
</P>
<P>
"They came and they shot and they left," he said. "They were after anyone they 
could get. It didn't matter who. 
</P>
<P>
"Summertime's coming," the man said. "It gets like that here in the summer. . . 
. It's just one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
The first of the attacks occurred about 4:20 p.m. Thursday, as Gonzales and 
Godinez were lounging with friends and relatives in front of a low wall near 
the corner of Newman and Monterey streets in Pomona. Godinez was holding his 
infant son. 
</P>
<P>
The area -- called "Cherryville" by the locals -- is known to police for the 
frequency of gang attacks and both Gonzales and Godinez were gang members, 
according to Pomona Police Detective Sgt. Ron Windell. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old woman named Renee -- who identified herself as Gonzales' 
girlfriend but, like other witnesses to the overnight shootings, declined to 
give her full name -- said she and her friends were "just sitting there when 
these two guys, they were about 17, got out of the car and started shooting. We 
all hit the pavement, 'cause we had nowhere to run. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They shot my boyfriend and my cousin's baby and the baby's father," Renee 
said. "They didn't say anything. They just got back in the car and drove off." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Windell said that Gonzales lay where he had fallen, mortally wounded. 
Godinez, hit twice but conscious, still held his infant son as they huddled 
together on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The infant, shot through the chest, was in critical condition Friday at Loma 
Linda University Medical Center in the San Bernardino County community of Loma 
Linda. His father was undergoing treatment for gunshot wounds in the arm and 
foot at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Two things helped save that baby's life," Windell said. "For one thing, the 
bullet that hit him was apparently the one that went through his father's arm, 
and that dissipated some of the energy. For another, there were two detectives 
half a block away who heard the shooting, and they rushed the child to the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, police arrested a 17-year-old youth at Park West High School in 
Pomona and booked him on suspicion of murder and attempted murder in the 
Gonzales-Godinez shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Gary Graham said the youth, whose name was withheld, was identified by 
witnesses as the one who fired the shots. The driver of the car was still being 
sought late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, a 16-year-old schoolgirl was shot as she, her brother and 
her boyfriend -- both identified as gang members -- strolled down a residential 
street in Highland Park when they were confronted by members of another gang. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said taunts were exchanged and one of the youths who confronted the 
three suddenly produced a gun and opened fire. The boy who fired the shot fled 
on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Dave Waterman said the girl's brother and friend apparently were the 
intended victims, but she was the only one who was hit. The suspect was not 
immediately identified, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, who was not identified, was reported is stable condition at 
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena with a chest wound. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said the attack in Florence occurred 
about four hours later, as a group of young people gathered in front of a home 
in the 1200 block of East 87th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just standing here talking, and that girl (Camille Pena) was standing 
over there in the driveway," said a 25-year-old witness, who identified himself 
only as "Big Shon." "We saw the guys down the street a way, sitting in a car. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"I turned around and all of a sudden they were standing right there with their 
guns -- a shotgun, a .357 (caliber pistol) and a rifle," Big Shon said. "They 
didn't say nothing. They just started emptying their guns." 
</P>
<P>
The witness said that as he ran for cover, the Pena girl slumped to the 
pavement and the assailants dashed for their car and drove off. Moments later, 
Big Shon said, he returned and attempted to revive the wounded girl. 
</P>
<P>
"She never said anything," Big Shon recalled. "She breathed for a while, but 
then that stopped. I tried CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), but it was too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
The fetus could not be saved. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Patrick Hunter, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, said that 
while the motive for the attack had not been determined, investigators are 
convinced it was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight, 16-year-old Frank Langston was slain by one of several 
shots fired from a passing car as he stood on a sidewalk near the Coliseum.

BUSH WON'T CITE JAPAN FOR UNFAIR TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE: THE U.S. NOTES ECONOMIC CONCESSIONS MADE BY TOKYO. THE CONGRESSIONAL 
BACKLASH APPEARS TO BE LESS THAN EXPECTED. 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush announced Friday that he will not brand Japan as an unfair 
trading partner this year, and indicated that he will concentrate on a broader 
goal -- negotiating a global trade accord that opens new markets worldwide to 
U.S. goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Bush approved a recommendation by his Cabinet-level Economic 
Policy Council that he not launch formal new trade complaints against any 
country, despite widespread demands in Congress that he do so. Last year, he 
cited Japan, Brazil and India as violators. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the President declared that from now on, the "highest priority" for 
U.S. trade policy would be "a timely and successful conclusion" to global trade 
talks, which are aimed at relaxing restrictions on trade in agriculture, 
services and intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, known more formally as the Uruguay Round, because they were 
launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986, are scheduled to end in December. 
Bush said the talks, being held in Geneva, are "the most promising route" for 
opening new trade opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Friday's decision reflects the President's belief that 
Japan has made enough concessions in recent trade talks with the United States 
that it deserves a break. They feared that targeting other countries now would 
jeopardize support for the Uruguay Round. 
</P>
<P>
Partly to avoid seeming to flout the 1988 Trade Act, which requires the White 
House to list its formal trade-negotiating priorities each spring, Bush 
continued the trade complaint that the Administration filed last year against 
India, to which New Delhi has yet to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The token inclusion of India, and personal appeals to key lawmakers by U.S. 
Trade Representative Carla A. Hills, muted the backlash that had been expected 
to emerge from Congress when the President's announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
While not exactly praising Bush's decision, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, conspicuously avoided the harsh 
criticism that he had issued earlier this week, instead congratulating Hills 
for not "abandoning" the Trade Act's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) also was more 
circumspect than had been expected. "I might have decided this one differently 
but hope that the Administration's decision has proven to be the right one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
White House strategists are betting that the congressional outcry -- which they 
still expect to be strong, particularly in the wake of Bush's decision not to 
target Japan -- nevertheless will die down as the lawmakers' attention is 
diverted to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Hills told a news conference Friday that "Japan has moved further this year 
than any other of our trading partners" to meet U.S. demands to open markets. 
She asserted that any move to single Tokyo out at this point would be 
"counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from Tokyo was restrained. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama 
issued a statement welcoming Bush's decision and pledging to "continue to make 
every effort" to promote good economic relations with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But he also reiterated that Japan, like many other countries, regarded the 
so-called Super 301 provision of the 1988 Trade Act -- which effectively 
threatens targeted countries with U.S. retaliation -- as itself a violation of 
international trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
It was such adverse reaction to the 1988 law around the globe that helped 
persuade Bush to avoid citing any specific countries this time around. Even 
Japan had technically refused to negotiate "under the gun." Talks with Tokyo 
were recast under a broader framework. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials took pains Friday to assure lawmakers that they had 
not given up maintaining pressure on Japan to open its markets. 
</P>
<P>
Hills reminded a press conference that a final report on the yearlong 
Structural Impediments Initiative, a series of broad-scale economic talks that 
the two countries have been holding for almost a year, is due in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is on notice," she said. "We expect maximum efforts to yield maximum 
results." 
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated that even though the Administration is eschewing the use of 
formal trade proceedings now, it will not hesitate to file new trade complaints 
if Japan reneges on its promises or if the Uruguay Round negotiations do not 
produce the desired results. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not need Super 301 now to address our priorities," she said. But she 
warned that the Administration will reconsider if current negotiations do not 
bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
In line with the 1988 Trade Act, the Administration also published a 
"watch-list" citing 23 countries that it believes are not adequately protecting 
intellectual property, such as patents and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the list are Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Greece, 
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, 
South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Venezuela and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
But the citations do not carry any threat of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hills disclosed that she has decided not to take further 
action to enforce a 1986 accord with Japan involving trade in semiconductors, 
despite demands by some U.S. microchip makers that she reimpose punitive 
tariffs on Tokyo for violating the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Hills said that although Japanese companies had not bought as many U.S.-made 
microchips as hoped, foreign penetration of the Japanese chip market has risen 
dramatically over the past year and a half and is increasing markedly. 
</P>
<P>
The list of trade concessions that Japan has made over the past several weeks 
is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
In the SII negotiations, Japan pledged to make sweeping reforms on a spate of 
major issues, from overhauling the country's archaic product distribution 
system and cracking down on monopoly practices by Japanese business to 
increasing public spending for infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo also moved to settle U.S. complaints involving satellites, 
super-computers and forest products. It eliminated roadblocks to protecting 
sound recordings. And it agreed to fast-track negotiations on 
telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The series of concessions from Japan followed a meeting between Bush and 
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu early in March in which the President 
warned that domestic pressures on the trade issue were intensifying, and that 
the Administration might not be able to control them.

LOCKHEED WILL LAY OFF 2,000 IN SOUTHLAND

In another sign that the local aircraft industry is slowing down, Lockheed 
Corp. said Friday it will lay off 2,750 salaried and hourly employees in its 
aircraft division, including 2,000 in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the cuts at its Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., which 
were expected, to the shrinking defense budget and the completion of some major 
defense projects, such as the contract to build the F-117A Stealth fighter 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, based in Calabasas, was not alone Friday in announcing 
defense-related cuts. General Electric Co. said it would eliminate 4,200 jobs 
over two years at GE Aerospace plants in New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lockheed announcement came only a day after McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
said it would cut 3,000 white-collar jobs at its operation in Long Beach, where 
its commercial and military aircraft divisions have suffered financial and 
production problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a sign of the times," said Jerry Cantwell, an industry analyst for 
Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New York, citing growing pressure to reduce 
military spending. Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale, however, said the layoffs 
were not directly related to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's announcement 
Thursday that he will seek $34 billion in spending cuts over the next six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,700 jobs will be eliminated at Lockheed's sprawling plant in Burbank, 
200 at its Palmdale plant and about 100 at a research center in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. The remaining 750 layoffs will occur at Lockheed's Marietta, 
Ga., facility. Most of the layoffs are expected to be implemented by July. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs represent about 16% of the aircraft division's local employees, and 
about 12% of its employees nationwide. "Slightly more than half" of the layoffs 
will be among salaried employees, Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed has already cut about 9,000 aircraft division jobs since 1988, when it 
began to scale down production of the C-5B cargo plane. And the company said 
the situation was not expected to brighten soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unlikely we will have any large new military aircraft production project 
that will begin before the mid-1990s," Ken Cannestra, president of Lockheed's 
aeronautical division, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed does not have any specific forecasts of more layoffs, but "it is 
possible we could see some more," Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials seemed resigned to the cuts. "It's an unfortunate situation," 
said Don Nakamoto, spokesman for District 727 of the International Assn. of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers. "We understand that their business is 
declining." 
</P>
<P>
The Lockheed layoffs did not surprise city officials in Burbank, who recalled 
the company's announcement a year ago that it plans to move its operations out 
of the area eventually. City officials said the layoffs also will hurt the 
local businesses that provide materials and services to Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to hear about any economic condition that causes residents and 
employers to reduce their work force," said Stephen Helvey, Burbank's assistant 
city manager. "It's obviously going to have some impact on our economy; it will 
be tough to know what that impact will be until we see what Lockheed's 
continued use of the facilities will be in the city." 
</P>
<P>
But officials said that even an entire pullout would not send the city into a 
tailspin. In fact, it could help the city by freeing up the land for more 
revenue-producing uses such as retail stores, City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard 
said. Also, the property tax base would jump if the land were sold and assessed 
at a higher value, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep might feel under pressure in the future to 
cut costs elsewhere in the company, said analyst Lawrence M. Harris, with 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. Harris noted that Tellep and his 
management team only recently prevailed against financier Harold C. Simmons in 
a bitter proxy battle for control of Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the proxy fight, Mr. Tellep has indicated increased emphasis 
will be placed on profits and cash flow, which means each of the units of 
Lockheed will be getting a closer look," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed last year delivered its last C-5B transport plane and TR-1 
reconnaissance plane to the Air Force and expects to deliver the last F-117A 
this year. Lockheed will build only six more P-3 anti-submarine planes -- for 
Canada and Pakistan -- by September, 1991.

GNP GROWS; INFLATION UP TO 6.5%; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: AN EXPANSION IN BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS SIGNALED. BUT CONCERNS ARE 
EXPRESSED OVER THE REPORT SHOWING INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS.

<P>
The nation's economy rebounded to an annual growth rate of 2.1% in the first 
quarter after nearly stalling out late last year, but a key measure of 
inflation surged to a disturbingly high annual rate of 6.5%, the Commerce 
Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the factors influencing the recovery in economic growth -- 
continued trade improvement, a reduction in unsold inventories and expanded 
business investment -- point to more expansion in the months ahead rather than 
the recession that some had feared. 
</P>
<P>
But they are concerned that the unexpectedly large increase in inflation, as 
measured by an index tied to the gross national product, could prompt the 
Federal Reserve Board to step on the brakes by maintaining or perhaps even 
raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. said that "the message is of solid 
growth in an economy that is poised to keep growing," tempered by "negative and 
worrisome" price increases that could force the Fed to dampen future growth. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation, he said, "was entrenched and widespread . . . and that has to be 
alarming from a policy-making point of view. For the Fed, the growth number is 
acceptable, but the inflation number must be unacceptable. The question is, how 
much slower must growth be for inflation to slow?" 
</P>
<P>
"The inflation number," added Robert G. Dederick, chief economist of the 
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, "was absolutely ugly." 
</P>
<P>
The resumed expansion of the gross national product was well above expectations 
of only a few weeks ago, when most economists were predicting a sluggish 
first-quarter GNP report similar to the 1.1% annual growth recorded during the 
last three months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Several components of the first-quarter gain were seen as portents of future 
economic growth. Business inventories dropped at a yearly rate of $20.5 
billion, while business investment gained $9.4 billion, or 7.6%. Both measures 
reversed course from late 1989, when inventories grew and investment declined. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the nation's trade balance improved, and sales of U.S. goods and 
services expanded both at home and abroad, the Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
But the upbeat indicators were overshadowed by rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
The 6.5% annual growth rate in the GNP price index, which measures actual price 
changes for all goods and services that make up the gross national product, was 
the highest quarterly reading since late 1981. It compares to an inflation rate 
of 4.5% for all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department statisticians said that about half of the inflationary 
acceleration was attributable to temporary energy and food price increases 
caused by December's record cold weather. But even excluding the effect of 
weather and a federal pay raise that went into effect in January, prices still 
rose at an annual rate of 5.2% during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist, acknowledged 
that the inflation report was "disappointing news." But he said he expects 
inflationary pressures to moderate later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
The report revived concerns that the Fed would be forced to tighten its grip on 
the nation's credit supply at a time when long-term interest rates already have 
risen above 9% for the first time in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates slow the economy by discouraging businesses and consumers 
from borrowing money to finance purchases and investments. Interest-sensitive 
industries such as housing and automobiles can be particularly hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have set ourselves up for a halfway decent first half of 1990," said Donald 
Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. "But 
by the end of the year, the economy will be slowing." 
</P>
<P>
The financial markets were jarred by the inflation report and its potential 
impact on interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.53 points 
Friday to close at 2,645.05. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Giulio Martini at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York said the 
Fed will have little choice but to tighten soon because both the economy and 
inflation are likely to keep rising. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reality the Fed has to contend with: a rate of inflation that's 
higher than the Fed can tolerate," Martini said. "I believe the Fed will be 
waiting to see if the strength we see in the economy here will be ratified 
later on. If so, the Fed will be forced to act. We already know that 2% growth 
isn't slow enough to bring inflation down." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, Commerce Department statisticians said that corporate 
profits fell by a revised amount of $9.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989, 
a slight improvement from the $9.5 billion decline reported a month ago. 
Profits fell $12.6 billion in the third quarter last year.

CHRISTIANS SHUT ISRAEL SITES TO PROTEST SETTLERS

The Church of the Holy Sepulcher and other sacred sites in Israel were shut 
Friday as Christians protested a Jewish settlement in the Christian Quarter of 
Jerusalem's Old City. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual show of unity, about 150 clergymen from nine major Christian 
sects gathered to oversee the closing of the church, the traditional site of 
Jesus' Crucifixion and burial. It is near the Hospice of St. John, a complex 
that 150 Jewish settlers are occupying in defiance of the Greek Orthodox 
Church, which owns it. 
</P>
<P>
Wajih Nusseibeh, a Muslim whose family keeps the key of the Church of the Holy 
Sepulcher, said he believes it is the first time the church has been shut since 
the Crusaders were driven out of the city by the Islamic warrior Saladin in the 
12th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of the Nativity, the site of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, and holy 
sites throughout Israel were also closed in the daylong protest. Church bells 
rang in somber, funereal cadence for about five minutes every hour, and black 
flags fluttered in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
In an act of solidarity, Muslim leaders closed Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque and 
Dome of the Rock shrine to tourists. Only worshipers were permitted in the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Samir Kafiti, the head of the Anglican Church in Jerusalem, told 
reporters that Christian leaders are dissatisfied with an Israeli Supreme Court 
decision, issued Thursday, to evict most of the Jewish settlers by Tuesday. 
Some would be allowed to stay pending a lower court decision on the tenancy 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Kafiti said the court decision is ambiguous because the judges did not return 
full control of the building to the Greek Orthodox Church. The church alleges 
that the settlers are in the building under an illegal sublease. 
</P>
<P>
The settlers moved into the 72-room Hospice of St. John on April 11, touching 
off angry protests from Palestinian Muslims and Christians and bringing 
international condemnation.

Israeli troops shot and wounded six Palestinians in the Jabaliya refugee camp 
in the occupied Gaza Strip when residents broke an army curfew to attend Muslim 
morning prayers, hospital sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A seventh Arab was injured by a percussion grenade in Jabaliya, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings, during clashes with troops, followed one of the bloodiest days 
of the last four months in a 28-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli 
rule. On Thursday, the army killed four Arabs and wounded at least 130 in the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Three of those killed were Jabaliya residents. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said troops also shot and wounded four Palestinians in Gaza 
City during sporadic clashes Friday, the second day of Eid al Fitr, the 
festival that ends of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
However, an Israeli army spokesman said security forces had no reports of 
injuries in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, in Tunis, Tunisia, it was disclosed that Yasser Arafat, leader 
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, sent a message to President Bush 
regarding Thursday's clashes in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
A PLO representative in Tunis gave the message to U.S. Ambassador Robert H. 
Pelletreau Jr., the PLO news agency WAFA said. The contents were not disclosed.

THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS CONFRONT MONGOLIA TROOPS

<P>
Thousands of opposition party demonstrators confronted troops and police in the 
Mongolian capital Friday, defying a government decree making such rallies 
illegal, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Communist authorities had called in the army since 
Mongolia's democracy movement sprang to life last December. 
</P>
<P>
No force was used, however, and the two-hour rally was peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10,000 people and 1,200 unarmed soldiers and police faced each other 
at noon in Sukhbator Square in the center of Ulan Bator, a Western diplomat 
said. Other witnesses estimated there were 20,000 to 30,000 people in the 
square during the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Police loudspeakers blared orders to leave the square, but demonstrators sang a 
popular protest song, "Honkh Nido" (Sound of the Bell), to drown them out. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-democracy rally was one of the biggest in Mongolia, although organizers 
had hoped that 60,000 people would turn out, one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat emerged from the imposing 
building which houses Mongolia's Parliament to take a look at the rally, a 
witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said it was the first big test of the new Communist Party leadership, 
installed in March in response to opposition demands. 
</P>
<P>
Mongolia, long dominated by the Soviet Union since becoming the world's second 
Communist state in the 1920s, has introduced democratic reforms rapidly and 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's rally followed abortive talks Thursday between Ochirbat, who was 
appointed last month, and the opposition Mongolian Democratic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The MDA demanded that Ochirbat establish a "temporary people's parliament" and 
an extraordinary commission representing all political parties before national 
elections are held. 
</P>
<P>
Ochirbat has pledged free elections in late July.

SHAMIR SEEKS LIKUD GOVERNMENT BUT WON'T RULE OUT A LABOR ROLE

Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he is trying to assemble a 
narrowly based government controlled by his hard-line Likud Party, but he 
declined Friday to rule out another coalition with the rival Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, who was given the task of forming Israel's next government by President 
Chaim Herzog on Friday, immediately ran into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Yigal Bibi, a legislator of the National Religious Party, said he will back 
Likud only if the center-left Labor Party joins the coalition. The surprise 
statement brought the two major parties back to a 60-60 deadlock in the 
120-seat Knesset (Parliament). 
</P>
<P>
Herzog had turned to Shamir after Shimon Peres, the Labor leader, announced 
Thursday he had failed to assemble a coalition after 35 days of effort. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, 74, head of the interim government, said he hopes to obtain a majority 
within the next three weeks, as required by the presidential mandate. Speaking 
to reporters, Shamir said prospects for a new Likud-Labor coalition "at the 
moment look unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
"I would never rule out the possibility" of a coalition with Labor, he said, 
"but my efforts in this period won't be aimed at a national unity government." 
</P>
<P>
Likud and Labor ruled for 15 months in an uneasy partnership before their 
government was brought down March 15 by a Knesset vote of no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis was prompted by Shamir's refusal to accept, as Labor demanded, a 
U.S. formula for arranging Israeli-Palestinian talks. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog urged Shamir to act quickly to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
"These days, the country is in a state of political and public confusion such 
as it has never known since its founding," the president said. "There is a 
heavy and true sense of depression in the public." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir hopes to lure three right-wing factions and three ultra-Orthodox parties 
into a majority coalition in the Knesset.

SOVIETS ASK FOR HELP ON CHERNOBYL PROBLEMS

A Soviet parliamentary delegation, decrying the secrecy their government 
imposed after the Chernobyl nuclear accident four years ago, made an urgent 
appeal to the United States and the world Friday for help in dealing with 
towering medical and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Severe shortages exist in medical equipment, radiological and other scientific 
laboratories, radiation detectors, housing for scores of thousands of relocated 
people and even baby food, the five-man delegation said at a news conference at 
the Soviet Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"The history of mankind never knew an ecological catastrophe which is so 
disastrous and having unknown consequences for the nature, health and life of 
the present and future generations," the delegation said, relaying an appeal 
made originally by officials of the Ukraine and endorsed this week by the 
Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri N. Shcherbak, chairman of the ecology subcommittee of the Supreme Soviet 
and a physician, said it had taken a political struggle to open secret medical 
records and uncover the true extent of the damage caused by the radiation that 
poured from the Chernobyl reactor 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of 
Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, on April 26, 1986, began with a fire in one of four reactors 
followed by a core meltdown and an explosion, which sent huge quantities of 
radiation billowing into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbak said thyroid disorders are beginning to appear along with the first 
cases of leukemia and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
He said serious medical effects are now expected to last decades, perhaps 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Kakimbek S. Salykov, chairman of the delegation, said deaths attributed to 
Chernobyl have reached at least 300, compared to the official report of 31. 
About 150,000 people show some effects of radiation poisoning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the true extent of medical damage may never be known because a 
shroud of secrecy was placed on data after the accident and no statistics were 
compiled on the effects of radiation on the 600,000 people who took part in the 
initial cleanup.

His remarks were reported the same day statistics were released saying Soviet 
industrial production amounted to $381 billion in the first quarter of 1990, 
down 1.2% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We were planning to move more slowly, but then we saw the process of industry 
of the last three or four months," Gorbachev said in a speech Thursday during a 
visit to Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"We noted that negative tendencies are not disappearing. On the contrary, they 
are increasing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One should not wait any more. Everything that was scheduled for 1992 and 1993 
we should begin carrying out now. This year something should be done and the 
main work on transferring to the market (economy) should start next year." 
</P>
<P>
An economic plan proposed by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and adopted by 
Parliament in December called for price reform starting in 1991, but postponed 
until 1993 other moves toward a market-based system and did not provide for 
monetary reform. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of addressing residents' worries about the sagging economy in 
the Ural Mountains city, Gorbachev traveled to nearby Nizhny Tagil and 
confronted a new issue: pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was besieged with complaints Friday about foul water and air in a 
city of 403,000 so polluted that children have drawn pictures of smog and 
written: "I don't want to die!" 
</P>
<P>
"Metal is metal, but people, Mikhail Sergeyevich, are not iron," a metalworker 
told the president as they met on the shop floor of the Nizhny Tagil 
Metallurgical Complex. The comment was reported by the Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
Huge demonstrations have been reported in Nizhny Tagil and other Soviet cities 
as residents demand a cleanup of air and water. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev took a walking tour of the sprawling metallurgical complex, stopping 
occasionally to field workers' questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I know about the situation with your water and air," Gorbachev responded. He 
said the solution lies in a government plan for modernizing local factories' 
equipment.

Thousands of riot police firing tear gas stormed the world's largest shipyard, 
clashing with striking workers barricaded inside and armed with homemade 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 police poured through five gates leading into the huge seaside 
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard in Ulsan, about 200 miles southeast of 
Seoul. About 20,000 of the shipyard's 24,000 employees are unionized. Workers 
have been on strike for three days, demanding the release of four labor leaders 
arrested in earlier protests.

Civil Defense officials put the number of homes destroyed in Kalapana Gardens 
since April 4 at 32, or about a quarter of the subdivision's homes. Two 
separate flows were joining together, and the lava surges caused Civil Defense

methane gas explosions. Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim 
warned residents that the town's one store and two churches could be destroyed

Freed hostage Robert Polhill has a growth on his vocal cords, a doctor 
disclosed Friday, as a silent Polhill said through his wife that he hoped soon 
to be welcoming others home from captivity in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill, in a statement read for him by his Lebanese-born wife, Firyal, said he 
and his family hoped his release Sunday marked "the beginning of the end to the 
hostage situation." 
</P>
<P>
A biopsy is to be performed soon, probably early next week, to see if the 
growth on his vocal cords is a tumor or an infection, said Dr. Russ Zajtchuk, 
deputy commander of clinical services at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where 
Polhill is being treated. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill's wife described him as "physically weak but mentally very, very 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
She read his statement and answered questions outside the hospital where her 
husband arrived Thursday for a stay that doctors said could last as long as 
three to four weeks. After his release, Polhill spent three days in another 
Army hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, before being flown to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that, at the moment, I am unable to thank you more directly and 
personally," Polhill said in the prepared statement. "But my voice decided to 
go on vacation before I did. 
</P>
<P>
"However, I do want you to know how very much I appreciate the warmth and 
sincerity of your welcome and the support you've given my wife and family, who 
join me in hoping that this is the beginning of the end to the hostage 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am, happily, now free to join you in your continued support for the loved 
ones of those who remain in captivity and in welcoming the hostages home in the 
very near future. Let's show the world that we, the American people, want to 
leave the past behind us, look positively to the future and, once and for all, 
close the file on the hostage issue." 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen Western hostages, seven of them Americans, are still held in the 
Middle East.

The state Senate approved a bill guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion and 
repealing Connecticut's unenforced anti-abortion statutes. 
</P>
<P>
The measure requires counseling for girls 15 and under before getting an 
abortion and encourages them to tell their parents. It now goes to Gov. William 
A. O'Neill, who has said he will sign it. The bill effectively codifies into 
state law much of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision. It 
allows abortions late in pregnancy -- when the fetus is capable of living 
outside the womb -- only when the life or health of the mother is in danger.

One man was critically injured in the violence and another was missing. The 
reservation straddles New York and Canada, but the violence so far has taken 
place on the United States side. After a week of nightly confrontations between 
Indians who support casino gambling and bingo on the U.S. side and those who 
oppose it, Canadian Mohawk leaders evacuated women, children and the elderly 
from the village of St. Regis in Quebec, which is near the violence on the New

CHERNOBYL HERO-PILOT IN U.S. FOR BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT

<P>
A Soviet pilot suffering a pre-cancerous condition because of his heroic 
flights to staunch radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear plant underwent a 
transplant of bone marrow rushed from a French donor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Four years and a day after the Chernobyl disaster, marrow donated by a 
42-year-old woman was flown to Seattle on Friday for transfusion into Anatoly 
Grishchenko. 
</P>
<P>
The marrow arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on a British Airways 
flight originating in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The marrow arrived one day after the fourth anniversary of the Chernobyl 
nuclear disaster in the Ukraine. The transplant procedure was expected to take 
from two to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, Grishchenko was found to have a pre-leukemia condition, 
typified by low counts of blood platelets needed for clotting and of white 
blood cells to fight infection and disease. 
</P>
<P>
Grishchenko, 53, is the first Chernobyl victim to receive medical care in the 
United States. He has up to a 75% chance of survival without a recurrence of 
the condition for five years, said Susan Edmonds of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
The transplant was arranged by Cap Parlier, light helicopter testing and 
evaluation director for McDonnell Douglas Corp., who said he spoke with 
Grishchenko by telephone a few hours before the transfusion was set to begin. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet civilian helicopter test pilot, who arrived at Hutchinson on April 
11, underwent a final round of radiation therapy Friday afternoon, Parlier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Grishchenko was honored as a Soviet hero for making five flights over Chernobyl 
in the four days after an explosion and fire at the reactor on April 26, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He flew repeatedly through the hot radioactive gases spewing from the plant to 
survey the damage and to dump tons of sand and wet concrete onto the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 31 people were killed. Unofficial reports said 
at least 250 died.

TWO STATES OK MILK HORMONE MORATORIUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a genetically engineered drug for cows were handed what they 
called a "major political victory" on Friday when Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. 
Thompson imposed a moratorium on use of bovine somatotropin (BST) by the 
state's dairy farmers until June 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
That action triggered a similar moratorium in Minnesota signed late Thursday by 
Gov. Rudy Perpich. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's moratorium was a "trigger" law, designed to take effect if 
Wisconsin, its primary competitor in cheese and other milk products, 
implemented a temporary ban. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two states produce about 20% of the nation's milk, and the action 
is a significant blow to the four companies -- Monsanto, Eli Lilly, American 
Cyanamid and Upjohn -- making the synthetic protein. The companies contend that 
the drug, a copy of the protein hormone that controls milk production in cows, 
is safe. Approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration is not expected 
until the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson actually vetoed the more stringent of two bills on BST, and through 
his line-item veto powers shortened the moratorium. Additionally, the bill he 
signed provides funding for biotechnology education and further studies of the 
potential effects of BST on human and animal health and on family dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said the potential 10% to 25% increase in milk production and 
resultant lower milk prices would be a fatal blow to family dairy farms. 
Similar legislation is pending in Vermont, New York and Pennsylvania. Jeremy 
Rifkin, head of the Foundation on Economic Trends, said that with the two 
moratoriums, BST opponents "have a bit of a steamroller going now." 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed but don't regard it as a significant setback," said Larry 
O'Neill of Monsanto. "In the long run, we believe the product's merits will 
prevail."

Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) was honored Friday for casting more votes than 
anyone in Senate history. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's vote on an amendment to a $3.4-billion supplemental spending bill was 
No. 12,134. 
</P>
<P>
He cast his first vote on Jan. 7, 1959. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Byrd has maintained a voting attendance record of 98.4% during his Senate 
service," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said in a tribute. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record was held by former Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.), who cast 
12,133 votes during his 31 years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"He has made a remarkable record in the Senate," said Sen. Strom Thurmond 
(R-S.C.). "He is one of the ablest parliamentarians who has ever served . . . 
throughout the history of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, 72, responded to the tribute by saying: "Records are made to be broken, 
and this record will be broken in time." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd went back to business after the tribute, delivering a speech criticizing 
the Bush Administration for not finding Japan in violation of trade agreements.

three other occupants were sleeping in another room when they were awakened by 
a smoke alarm, and they fled. 
</P>

The fire spread to the water bed, causing it to rupture and douse the blaze, 
said Lt. Gary Pipes of the Arlington Fire Department. He said the fire caused

SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY MEDFLIES WILL BE SPRAYED; 
</P>
<P>
MALATHION: CAMPAIGN LIKELY WILL BEGIN MAY 11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a strong indication that malathion-bearing helicopters won't soon depart the 
region, state agricultural officials announced Friday their decision to treat a 
new, 34-square-mile infestation in San Bernardino County with up to eight 
aerial applications of the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
The new aerial spraying campaign, tentatively set to begin May 11 over parts of 
the cities of Highland and San Bernardino, will extend at least through the 
beginning of July and may require weekly spraying during that period. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henry, deputy director of the eradication project, added that because of 
the growth of the Medfly infestation it appears that other new Medfly outbreaks 
may face the same regimen of repeated aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to spray San Bernardino is the first blow to the state's plan to 
end repeated malathion spraying by May 9 throughout the Southland and rely on 
the more benign treatment of releasing millions of sterile fruit flies, used to 
breed the pest out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss announced last 
month that he expected an abundant supply of sterile flies from breeding 
facilities in Hawaii, allowing an end to multiple spraying in old areas and 
limiting spraying in newly infested areas to no more than twice. 
</P>
<P>
Voss also announced that no area would have to face the grim prospect of being 
sprayed once a week "since sterile insects will replace all bait treatments by 
early May," according to a March press release. 
</P>
<P>
Voss' decision, which was made in part to quell the public outcry over 
malathion spraying, overruled the recommendation of the state's scientific 
advisers in the eradication campaign who believed that spraying should not stop 
in many areas because of concerns that infestation would grow in the spring and 
there would not be enough sterile flies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, over the last month, about 150 more square miles have become infested 
with the pest and a new breeding facility in Hawaii has experienced production 
problems, reducing the available supply of sterile flies. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Layaye, San Bernardino agricultural commissioner, said the San Bernardino 
spray zone probably will have to be treated completely with malathion spraying 
because of the sterile fly shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Layaye said he expected that the area will have to be sprayed on a weekly basis 
because hot weather drains malathion's potency against insects. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Magee, associate director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, 
said this week that the unexpected size of the infestation and the potential 
shortfall in the sterile fly supply has forced the state to reassess if it can 
safely phase out spraying in previously infested areas. 
</P>
<P>
Voss was unavailable for comment Friday. Magee and Assistant Director Isi 
Siddiqui, who is in charge of the eradication campaign, were also unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The latest spraying order brings the total area under malathion treatment to 
about 470 square miles in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange and Riverside 
counties. 
</P>
<P>

The preliminary hearing for landlady Dorothea Puente, accused of killing nine 
of her elderly tenants for their pension checks, will be open to reporters but 
not to TV or newspaper cameras, a judge ruled Friday. Municipal Judge Gail D. 
Ohanesian's decision ended a three-day legal battle by the news media over 
coverage of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Puente's attorneys had asked that the hearing be closed to all media coverage. 
The sensational case already has attracted nationwide publicity. Puente's 
lawyers argued that coverage of the hearing would prejudice her right to a fair 
trial in Sacramento County. Ohanesian said there are "substantial grounds" for 
the defense argument of prejudice, but that it had to be balanced against the 
right of public access to criminal justice.

'SAN QUENTIN 6' DEFENDANT SPAIN WILL NOT BE RETRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Closing a bloody chapter in California history, Marin County Dist. Atty. Jerry 
Herman said Friday that he will not refile charges against "San Quentin Six" 
co-defendant Johnny L. Spain for participating in a 1971 prison escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, a former Black Panther now free on bail to lecture college students and 
counsel troubled youths, had his double-murder conviction overturned by a 
federal appeals court because he was shackled before the jury during his 
204-day trial in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused a prosecution appeal to reinstate one 
conspiracy and two murder convictions produced in that trial. Prosecutors had 
90 days to set a new trial date to retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Since this case is now 19 years old, and since the defendant Spain has now 
been out of custody and led a crime-free life for three years, it is impossible 
to believe that a conviction secured after a retrial would result in the 
defendant Spain being resentenced to prison," he told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, 40, has actually been out of prison since March, 1988, when a judge 
ordered the state parole board to ignore the San Quentin melee when deciding 
whether Spain was suitable for parole from a 1967 murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Herman said the widows and families of three prison guards who were killed in 
the incident, and three other guards who survived after their throats were cut 
"support our decision not to retry the case." 
</P>
<P>
Inmate George Jackson, author of the book "Soledad Brother," also died in the 
incident, which authorities said began when Jackson used a smuggled gun to try 
to escape from the prison's isolation unit. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, then serving a life sentence for a Los Angeles murder committed when he 
was 17, was one of six inmates accused of plotting the escape. They became 
known as the "San Quentin Six." Prosecutors did not suspect Spain himself of 
killing anyone during the brief revolt.

BIG LAST HALF FROM WORTHY SAVES LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
GAME 1: HE FINISHES WITH 34 POINTS TO PICK UP L.A. AFTER ROCKETS LEAD BY SIX AT 
HALFTIME. 
</P>

<P>
They sometimes call him "Big Game" James, and Friday night certainly qualified 
as such. So, James Worthy adjusted his goggles, hitched his shorts and went to 
work on methodically dismantling the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
In leading the Lakers to a 101-89 victory over the Rockets in Game 1 of their 
first-round series, Worthy dominated offensively as seldom before seen and was 
a integral part of the Lakers' defensive scheme that all but shut down Akeem 
Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
If it seemed as if Worthy was everywhere on the Forum court, well, he was. 
Worthy scored 34 points, had 11 rebounds and, despite six turnovers, was a 
steadying force. 
</P>
<P>
He made 17 of 22 shots -- including his first nine in the second half -- by 
exploiting defender Buck Johnson inside, burning Buck outside and leaving all 
Rockets behind on the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
For years now, Worthy's internal body clock has emitted a blaring wakeup call 
whenever the playoffs arrive. Friday night, a big game from James was needed 
more than ever before in a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
"James always has good efforts for us in the playoffs," Magic Johnson said. "I 
think tonight rates with some of the other good ones he's had. He picked up 
everybody, got everybody going. He did a lot of different things to lift us." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Lakers won their 19th consecutive first-round playoff game. 
They have never lost since the NBA switched to the best-of-five format in 1984. 
They will try for a 2-0 advantage on Sunday, when the Rockets no doubt will try 
to slow Worthy in what is the most lopsided matchup in the series. 
</P>
<P>
After the Lakers trailed by six points at halftime, Worthy simply would not let 
the team lose this one. He made four of his last five shots late in the second 
quarter, when he said he finally loosened up after trying too hard early, and 
then sank nine straight well into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy's first miss was a jump shot to beat the 24-second clock with about six 
minutes to play. By that time, the Lakers had a 13-point lead. The outcome had 
been decided. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Worthy was not the only Laker to have a big game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who, like Worthy, overcame a slow start, had 23 points and 14 assists 
to offset six turnovers. A.C. Green added 13 points and was one of center 
Mychal Thompson's helpers on Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who claims he has no chance guarding Akeem Olajuwon without several 
other warm bodies near, outplayed the Rockets' younger, stronger and -- on most 
nights -- better center. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson scored 12 points, had eight rebounds and five blocked shots. But it 
was his defense against Olajuwon that mde a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, briefly felled by a cut over his left eye, had only four points 
through three quarters and finished with 13 points and 14 rebounds. That's not 
a bad night for anyone other than Olajuwon, who made only five of 13 shots and 
attempted only four free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"James was a big reason why we won, but I think the guy who helped us the most 
defensively was Mychal T," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "He played excellent 
post defense. I haven't seen too many centers block Akeem Olajuwon's shots. The 
combination of Mychal's defense and the team defensive help turned Akeem into a 
passer." 
</P>
<P>
That might not have been such a bad thing for the Rockets had their supporting 
players shot better. The Rockets made just 43.2% of their shots, with guards 
Eric (Sleepy) Floyd and Vernon Maxwell combining to sink only 14 of 37 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Akeem did a good job passing the ball, but we just weren't hitting," 
Rocket Coach Don Chaney siad. "We may have to start to do something to get him 
the basketball more. To be successful, we have to have him involved." 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell had 20 points and power forward Otis Thorpe 21, but the Rockets were 
not in sync offensively after the Lakers got themselves together late in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
If such a thing is possible from a veteran team such as the Lakers, they came 
out too inspired and jittery for the playoff opener. It resulted in four 
turnovers for Worthy in four minutes. Johnson, too, was forcing drives to the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, therefore, the Lakers had 16 turnovers, made only 47.5% of 
their shots and definitely had to feel fortunate to be trailing only by six 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, we weren't playing good, but at least we were playing 
hard," Johnson said. "That was the worst I ever played. There was no timing. It 
happened and we dealt with it. We just said, 'let's settle down,' and then 
James took the game over." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, normally unflappable and poker-faced, was uncharacteristically pressing 
in the first half. Riley said he noticed it because it happens so rarely. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, James was squeezing the air out of the ball," Riley said. 
"I think we were too ready to play. But (Johnson and Worthy) both calmed down. 
It happens to the great players, too. We were too keyed up." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy had regained composure with about four minutes left in the half. He sank 
four of his last five shots of the half, two coming inside and two on jump 
shots. Then came a vintage Worthy second half, which included long jumpers, 
spin moves inside, fast-break dunks, even a finger roll. 
</P>
<P>
Although he does not get easily riled, Worthy admitted to feeling a little too 
eager for the playoff opener. After all, he, Johnson and Thompson had sat out 
that publicized -- and expensive -- final regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was over anxious," Worthy said. "I was trying to force the issue. I had to 
settle down and play within myself, take my time. After a few minutes, 
everything was all right. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we (he and Johnson) are both going to learn from this game. They 
played well.

JAZZ LOSES BIG LEAD, BUT STILL WINS, 113-96 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

SALT LAKE CITY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being swept by the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the 
playoffs last season and winning only five of its final 13 games this season, 
the Utah Jazz's playoff opener against the Phoenix Suns Friday night was vital. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz won it, 113-96, before 12,616 at the Salt Palace, but it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz, ahead by 21 points early in the fourth quarter, saw the Suns pull 
within seven before putting together a late rally to get its first playoff 
victory since the 1988 Western Conference semifinals against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz players were very much aware of the pressure going into this series, the 
first meeting between 50-game winners in the first round since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"Any game is so important to win in a playoff series," said Jazz guard Bobby 
Hansen, who scored seven of his 16 points in the fourth quarter. "But after 
last year's fiasco, this was especially sweet. It shows we can win in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
They can joke about it now. The atmosphere wouldn't have been so light with a 
loss. Walls closing weigh too much. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns have reason to be encouraged despite the loss. They were in the game 
most of the way even with little contribution from point guard Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson started, but the effects of flu soon wore on him. After nine minutes, 
he was done, leaving for good with 8:37 remaining in the second quarter -- one 
shot, five assists and three turnovers to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably should have stayed in the hotel," Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said. 
"He wanted to play, and that's what he tried to do, but he couldn't. The first 
couple of times he came out on his own and the last time he came out on me." 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, Utah exploited the situation that left Greg Grant, who averaged 10.1 
minutes in 35games during the regular season, in charge of the Phoenix offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz's half-court trap bothered the Suns, producing 16 points on turnovers 
in the third quarter and sparking a 20-9 run in the final 6:35. That provided 
an 83-67 advantage heading into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make a few adjustments for Sunday," Sun forward Tom Chambers said 
of Game 2 in the best-of-five series, for which Johnson is expected to be 
healthy. "But if the ball starts dropping, you'll be surprised at how few 
adjustments are really needed." 
</P>
<P>
They proved that in the fourth quarter with the Jazz ahead, 89-68, with 10:23 
to play. With 5:45 left, after the first of three three-point baskets in the 
fourth quarter by Mike McGee, the lead had been whittled to 93-83. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Suns, who won three of four meetings from Utah during the season, 
pulled to within 103-96, thanks to another three-point basket by McGee, the 
former Laker who opened the season in Italy before joining Phoenix in late 
March. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a very good night for stars. 
</P>
<P>
Utah's Karl Malone made only two of 10 shots in the first half before finishing 
eight of 20 for 21 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Mark Eaton had three fouls by 6:28 of the second quarter, four as of 
11:08 in the third, and played only 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The game was so important to me that maybe I came out and rushed things at the 
start," Malone said, another reminder of what this outing meant to the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers started by making three of 11 from the field, a big reason the Suns 
shot just 38.1% in the first two quarters and trailed, 58-47, at halftime. 
Chambers improved in the second half and ended the night five of 16 for 19 
points. 
</P>
<P>
John Stockton, though, played well. Utah's point guard had 17 assists and 16 
points, though he made only one of seven shots in the third quarter operating 
mostly against the 5-7 Grant.

BASEBALL NEEDS TO CHANGE TO A PLATOON SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM POLLINS, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the 1990 major-league baseball season is finally under way, we can get 
on with the really serious business: How soon will baseball go in for a 
semi-free substitution setup somewhat akin to pro football's platoon system? 
</P>
<P>
The idea, of course, is to have the best hitters hitting, the best fielders 
fielding and the best baserunners running the bases as much as possible -- 
producing the higher scores that American sports fans tend to favor without 
robbing baseball of its status as a game of strategy. All that's needed are a 
couple of rule changes -- and, of course, a fundamental rethinking of the 
national pastime. But before we look at how New Baseball might operate, let's 
examine the numerous ways in which the game will be improved by more liberal 
substitution: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The standard of play will be raised. One appeal of professional sports is 
that the games fans play, or played when they were younger, are taken to 
amazing and entertaining new levels of excellence. Major-league baseball today 
features too many batters who are virtual automatic outs, too many fielders 
with bad hands or erratic arms and too many baserunners who are slow afoot or 
lacking in quickness, instincts and timing. 
</P>
<P>
A platoon system will allow players to showcase only the skills that make them 
special, while permitting teammates gifted in other areas to replace them at 
bat, in the field or (occasionally) on the bases. The result will be an 
immediate strengthening of every team's offense and defense. Only the most 
stubborn purist would be against the resulting higher caliber of play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offenses will be helped. Semi-free substitution will improve both 
components of team offense (hitting and baserunning) but will elevate only the 
fielding component of team defense (since pitching will be unaffected.) This 
help for the squad at bat is desirable because pitchers (especially relievers) 
continue to dominate the game to the detriment of the sport's potential 
excitement level. No matter how tightly the umpires squeeze the strike zone 
(and the one being called today is but a fraction of the zone dictated by the 
rule book), pitchers routinely overpower hitters -- particularly in a game's 
pivotal moments. 
</P>
<P>
This happens because the pitching staff has been allowed to evolve into a group 
of specialists while the rest of the ballclub has not: 1) Although they occupy 
only one of the nine positions on the field, moundsmen fill about 40 percent of 
the roster slots. 2) Starting pitchers are no longer expected to finish games, 
so instead of pacing themselves they go as hard as they can for as long as they 
can. 3) Early-exiting starters give way to long relievers, setup men, lefty and 
righty closers and even ultraspecialists whose job is to retire a given hitter. 
The offense today has no real counter for such group tactics -- for such an 
assortment of speeds, styles and angles -- and the few hitters who could 
legitimately hurt the pitchers are walked or given nothing but junk to hit. 
Platoon baseball will challenge the pitchers with stronger lineups and more 
speed on the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Games will be more action-packed and entertaining. With more potent batting 
attacks, pitchers will be forced to challenge the hitters. With faster runners 
on base, the men on the hill will be wary of walking potential runs. Thus, more 
balls will be put into play. Even though some of these will be handled by a 
superior defense, a faster-paced game and a more entertaining brand of ball is 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All-around players will stand out more than they do now. The player who 
excels on both offense and defense will continue to play full time. He will 
also take up only one roster spot while (in effect) filling two positions, 
creating a slot for an offensive ultraspecialist. Multi-talented stars also are 
likely to be the beneficiaries of a more equitable pay scale and more 
enlightened most-valuable-player and Hall of Fame balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Better use will be made of the entire roster. Managers are constantly 
trying to find ways to keep their reserves from accumulating rust. Under a 
system permitting liberal substitution, staying sharp will be easy for starters 
and scrubs alike. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strategy will still have its place in the game. It's a canard that the 
designated-hitter rule has taken strategy out of the American League version of 
the sport. By far the most important decision a manager in either league has to 
make once the game begins is when to change pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
In the National League, the decision is frequently determined by the need for a 
pinch-hitter with runners on base, and in a given situation nearly all field 
generals would make the same move; there are not many gray areas. Not so in the 
AL or in platoon baseball; since the pitcher never bats, the manager's decision 
depends entirely on matters of strategy -- his judgment of the pitcher's 
effectivenesss, the state of his bullpen, the potential opposing pinch-hitters. 
Similarly, the relaxation of restrictions on substitutions in the field and on 
the bases will confront managers with new and interesting choices come game 
time. If a way can be found to expand the roster, sufficient offensive 
ammunition will be available so that even more than the usual managerial wheels 
will be turning. 
</P>
<P>
Very few rules need to be changed to order to implement this new system. Here 
they are: Any non-pitcher may man any defensive position at any time. Players 
may come out of and return to the "defensive lineup" without being 
disqualified. All current rules governing the "offensive lineup" (batting 
order) shall remain in effect with one exception: Up to five pinch-runners per 
contest may be used before a player being run for is pulled from the batting 
order. Each pinch-runner must still come from outside of the batting lineup and 
no pinch-runner may be used more than once. That's it. All other tenets of the 
sport remain sacrosanct. 
</P>
<P>
The key element in platoon baseball is roster size. Ideally, the roster should 
be: 1) big enough to allow for offensive and defensive specialists, but small 
enough to require a certain number of two-way players; 2) large enough to 
continue today's platooning (such as lefty pitcher against righty hitter, 
though the new breed of better curve-ball hitters may make that ploy obsolete) 
but not so large that teams will be tempted to dramatically increase the number 
of pitchers on the squad; 3) considerable enough to allow full use of the 
baserunning changes while maintaining adequate firepower on the bench, yet not 
so unwieldy so as to take substitutional strategy out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Rosters currently consist of 24 players -- typically 10 pitchers, two catchers, 
seven infielders and five outfielders. Platoon baseball might work best at 30, 
with all but one of the six new slots going to non-pitchers. Since the owners 
are even now resisting a return to 25-man squads, the additional jobs might 
materialize in increments. As rookie salaries are adjusted to reflect a new pay 
scale favoring two-way players (perhaps with an NBA-like team salary cap), 
owners will become more amenable to bigger rosters. The point is that loosening 
the substitution restrictions will improve the sport no matter what the roster 
size, but there is a roster size at which the great game would thrive best. 
</P>
<P>
Football players used to routinely play on both sides of the ball, yet fans 
came to accept that sport's progression into an age of specialization. So, too, 
will followers of the game of summer embrace platoon baseball once the system 
kicks in and the pluses are evident. 
</P>
<P>
Even traditionalists should come around in time, since the subtle delights of 
baseball they enjoy most will remain an integral part of the sport. Wily 
infielders will continue to creep slightly to the left or right just before the 
ball is pitched in order to be in perfect fielding position. Crafty hurlers 
will still throw hard and tight to set up an offspeed strikeout on the outside 
corner. Daring and instinctive baserunners will always play cat and mouse with 
opposing pitchers, catchers and infielders. Organizations adept at finding, 
developing and utilizing talent will prosper as they always have. (Deciding 
which athletes to fully develop as two-way players will be especially crucial.) 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, if a team is receiving terrific play from what used to 
be a weak or mixed position in the lineup -- say, a shortstop-ninth-place 
hitter -- does it actually matter if the contribution is coming from a duo of a 
skilled batsman and a brilliant gloveman who substitute for each other when 
common sense dictates? 
</P>
<P>
Play in basketball, soccer and hockey is continuous, making separate offensive 
and defensive units impractical. Some sports, though, have natural breaks as 
teams switch from offense to defense and back again. Football makes good use of 
those moments. The day is approaching when baseball will do likewise. That time 
between half innings is there for a purpose.

DAVE DISTEL: MACEK SHUTS THE BOOK ON AIR CORYELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three players have left the Chargers in the past couple of weeks, two of them 
amid swirling and bitter controversy and the other with quiet dignity and good 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
Two of them spent their Charger careers in headlines, and the other drew about 
as much attention as the equipment manager. 
</P>
<P>
Two of them were paid much for not much, and the other contributed much for not 
much, at least relatively speaking. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was running back Gary Anderson, traded to Tampa Bay. Anderson will 
be best remembered for one glorious dive into the end zone against Miami in 
1986. Good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was quarterback Jim McMahon, outright released. He will be 
remembered for an inglorious blowing of his nose in 1989. Indeed, it can been 
debated whether losing McMahon was better for San Diego than gaining America's 
Cup. Good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
The third was center Don Macek, who retired Friday. He will be remembered for . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Well? 
</P>
<P>
Centers are remembered only, or at least mainly, by their coaches, teammates 
and families. By temperament, this is usually the way they prefer it. 
</P>
<P>
"The center position," Macek said, "has been good to me. It's a tough position, 
but a good position. It's something not a lot of guys can do." 
</P>
<P>
Macek did it and did it well. That should be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to announce his retirement Friday, he probably had more 
to say than in all of his 14 years with the Chargers. That's the way it is with 
centers. They never become media darlings . . . or media targets, for that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
You know where Macek is coming from when he talks of his mother and father and 
brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
"They've all said I've made them proud," he said. "It doesn't get much better 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe centers understand the intangibles so much better because there are no 
tangibles. A center cannot point to rushing yardage or pass receptions or 
touchdown passes, though he should. Centers have a major role in making them 
all happen. 
</P>
<P>
Don Macek, for sure, was the center for those championship teams of 1979, 1980 
and 1981. It might be more than a coincidence that he was switched from guard 
to center in 1979. Remember that. 
</P>
<P>
Consider also that Macek might be the best center never to have participated in 
a Pro Bowl. It certainly was not because he didn't deserve it. Those were 
Charger teams with so many offensive stars that there were not enough berths to 
go around. Those were years, in fact, when the AFC could have sent the entire 
Charger offense to the Pro Bowl . . . and won. 
</P>
<P>
Those years and those teams were certainly memorable. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone asks about highlights," Macek said, "and that's an easy question to 
answer. Being part of the Air Coryell unit." 
</P>
<P>
Pause briefly here to note that Macek used the expression "being part of the 
unit." Reflected glory was just fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
"We played football with a style and flair like nobody had ever done before and 
I don't believe anyone will do again," he said. "It was exciting what it did to 
the town. It made the town come alive. There was a buzz in the air throughout 
those times I haven't felt since, except maybe during the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
Being a center, Macek went through those years upside down and backwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," he said, "that was fun. You snap the ball, block for two or three 
seconds and then walk 20 or 30 yards down field. That was the way it was in 
those years." 
</P>
<P>
Goals? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Macek had goals . . . exactly the kind of goals you'd expect of the guy. 
</P>
<P>
"My main goal was to be the best player I could be," he said, "and another goal 
was to play long enough for my kids to appreciate what I did." 
</P>
<P>
Being good enough to play 14 years took care of both, though 16-month-old 
daughter Jenna might have to appreciate through videotape. Son Scott, 8, and 
daughter Lindsay, 6, are old enough to have found their father in the middle of 
the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"My son wants to play for the Chargers," Macek said, "and he wants to wear No. 
62." That, of course, was Macek's number. "But he wants to be a wide receiver." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the kid has been watching films of Air Coryell. Had to be. He was 
born the week Air Coryell bombed Oakland, 55-21, in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
All of Macek's kids should know that their father was the last active member of 
the Air Coryell "unit" to leave the Chargers. They should know only Dan Fouts 
and Russ Washington played more years for this team. 
</P>
<P>
And anyone with a sense of the history of this franchise should know Jim 
McMahon and Gary Anderson were mere footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
Don Macek was a book. A good book.

MORNING BRIEFING: AGENCY HAS POOR TRACK RECORD ON THIS ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York advertising agency ran into problems when it prepared a radio 
commercial to promote the 40th anniversary of Yonkers Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial started: "The year is 1950 and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower is 
president. The Army-McCarthy hearings are going full blast." 
</P>
<P>
One problem. Actually, two. Harry Truman was president in 1950. The 
Army-McCarthy hearings started in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
A corrected commercial was prepared. Eisenhower was replaced by Truman, and the 
McCarthy hearings were replaced by Bobby Thomson's historic home run for the 
New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Still one problem. Thomson hit his home run in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lipman, head of Lipman, Richmond and Greene, the agency that prepared 
the commercials, said, "So, we were off by a year or two here and there." 
</P>
<P>
A third commercial was prepared. The reference to Thomson was dropped and not 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Lipman said, "We finally gave up on trying to be factual." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do Don Slaught of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Todd Zeile of 
the St. Louis Cardinals have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Counter punch: Wallace Matthews of Newsday, in a story on the recovery of 
boxing publicist Irving Rudd from heart surgery, recalled Rudd's classic line 
when somebody said, "Howard Cosell is his own worst enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Rudd said, "Not while I'm alive." 
</P>
<P>
Add Rudd: Of his relationship with fighter Thomas Hearns, he said: "There's 
nothing I wouldn't do for him and there's nothing he wouldn't do for me. And 
that's how it's been for 10 years -- we've done nothing for each other." 
</P>
<P>
Who needs it: Walt Hriniak, batting coach of the Chicago White Sox, runs a 
hitting school in the off-season, and one of his pupils over the winter was 
Cory Snyder of the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent two-game series against the White Sox, Snyder went four for eight, 
with a homer. 
</P>
<P>
White Sox Manager Jeff Torborg said, "I think from now on, Walt said he's not 
going to do any more work with guys from other clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Sixty years ago today: On April 28, 1930, the first night game in organized 
baseball was played at Independence, Kan., in the Western Assn. Muskogee 
defeated Independence, 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
Strong words: Kevin McHale of the Boston Celtics told the Boston Globe he would 
vote for Philadelphia's Charles Barkley as the league MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why, he said, "Because he's a much better person than the rest of them, 
and that should count for something." 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
Shear madness: The Oakland Athletics' Rickey Henderson might have lost his job 
as clubhouse barber after the hatchet job he did on pitcher Mike Norris. Said 
Norris after being left with nothing on the sides and a thatch on top, "I'm 
afraid to face my girlfriend when we get home." 
</P>
<P>
A's announcer Lon Simmons told Norris, "It looks like you cut your hair in a 
pencil sharpener." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Both are catchers from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: St. Louis Manager Whitey Herzog, after the Cardinals had played on a 
32-degree night in Pittsburgh: "One thing about baseball -- the dugout heaters 
only work when it's hot." HARLEY TINKHAM

BRUINS, CAPITALS TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS, WILL MEET IN WALES FINALS

Glen Wesley scored only his second goal of the playoffs, but the defenseman put 
the Boston Bruins into the Wales Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley's 25-foot slap shot broke a 1-1 tie with 73 seconds left and the Bruins 
beat the Canadiens, 3-1, Friday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
An empty net goal by Cam Neely with five seconds remaining completed the 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get too many opportunities in a lifetime to beat the Canadiens," 
Wesley said. "When you get a chance to put them away, it's an exciting 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Coach Mike Milbury said: "It's sweet because (the Canadiens) threw 
everything at us. It's sweet because we move on." 
</P>
<P>
Boston's Randy Burridge and Montreal's Stephan Lebeau scored in the first 
period. The game appeared headed for overtime before Boston's decisive assault 
on goalie Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Janney passed the puck from behind the net to Garry Galley, who fired a 
long slap shot. It was deflected by Montreal's Guy Carbonneau and ricocheted 
off the backboards. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Propp, facing an open left side of the net, missed a swipe at the puck at 
the left corner of the crease. It continued out to Wesley, who put it past Roy 
as Mike Keane and Carbonneau dove to stop the puck. 
</P>
<P>
"That's two chances," Keane said. "You don't give a good team two chances to 
put (the puck) in the net." 
</P>
<P>
Roy said he saw Wesley's shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The puck hit my pad and bounced in the top corner," he said. "If I had been 
able to see the initial shot (by Galley), I think I would have had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens were scoreless in 22 power-play opportunities in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 2, New York Rangers 1 -- John Druce scored 6:48 into overtime at New 
York as the Capitals advanced to the Stanley Cup semifinals for the first time 
in their 17-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Druce's goal was his eighth in the series. He also scored four times in the 
opening-round series against New Jersey. DAN HAFNER

ECKERSLEY FALTERS AND A'S LOSE FIRST ROAD GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it appeared that the Oakland Athletics might not lose a game on the 
road all season, they let one get away in the ninth inning Friday night at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Gene Nelson didn't get the job done and the Red Sox ended the A's 
eight-game road winning streak, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics, with Mike Norris doing an effective job in relief and Mark 
McGwire hitting a two-run homer, held a 6-4 lead. When Norris walked Jody Reed 
and gave up a single to Mike Greenwell to start the ninth, Nelson entered the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson got Dwight Evans to hit into a fielder's choice, but Tony Pena, who 
already had three hits, singled in a run. An infield out put runners on second 
and third with two out. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Burks then singled to right-center, driving in Pena and Randy Kutcher to 
win the game. 
</P>
<P>
Burks, off to a poor start, had been dropped to seventh in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get a hit in a situation like that," Burks said, "it improves your 
confidence. I just tried to meet the ball and I looped one out there that fell 
safely. It was a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Pena, one of the top hitters in the American League, has hit safely in 15 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 9, Detroit 6 -- Greg Brock is leaving no doubt that he has made a 
complete recovery from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Brock drove in three runs at Detroit and the Brewers moved ahead of Toronto 
into first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers, who won for the eighth time in nine games, gave Jack Morris a 
difficult time. Morris (2-2) is 0-6 against the Brewers in his last seven 
starts. He gave up 10 hits and seven runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Molitor, getting a chance to bat for the first time this season after 
recovering from a thumb injury, had two hits to help spark the Milwaukee 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Toronto 1 -- Greg Hibbard gave up just two hits in eight innings at 
Chicago and the White Sox knocked the Blue Jays out of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbard did not give up a hit until the fifth inning when Glenallen Hill led 
off with a single and scored on a two-out single by Junior Felix. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays had beaten the White Sox seven times in a row, six of them at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbard said he learned a lesson from losing Sunday at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I was using my fastball in and out more this time," he said. "Before the game 
I huddled with my catcher, Carlton Fisk. He kept telling me I really wasn't 
that bad Sunday. I feel pretty good about this effort." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 7, Minnesota 2 -- The Indians used three two-run home runs to help 
Bud Black (2-0) win at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Black, despite getting hit in the leg with a line drive in the fourth inning, 
took a shutout into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
But Fred Manrique, who hit the line drive that struck Black, and Kirby Puckett 
hit back-to-back home runs to chase the left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Belle's first home run of the season made it 2-0 in the second inning. 
Carlos Baerga and Candy Maldonado homered in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Baltimore 3 -- It was not so long ago that the Mariners rarely won 
on the road. After winning at Baltimore, they are one of only three teams in 
the league with a winning record away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Valle hit a two-run homer and Erik Hanson allowed only three hits in eight 
innings to improve his record to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 7, Kansas City 6 -- If Eckersley isn't the best closer in the league, 
Mark Davis of the Royals probably is. 
</P>
<P>
Davis faltered Friday night, but it wasn't exactly his fault. Ruben Sierra's 
line drive was misjudged by left fielder Pat Tabler, and the Rangers scored 
four times in the ninth inning to beat the Royals. DAN HAFNER

OTHER JOSE PRODUCES FOR ATHLETICS IN A BIG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENT BAKER, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an outfield that includes Jose Canseco and the Hendersons -- Rickey and Dave 
-- there isn't much room for the latest Oakland Athletics phenom, Felix Jose. 
</P>
<P>
He will have to get his playing time when one of the Big Three requires a day 
off or suffers an injury, as Rickey Henderson did when his calves tightened 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday night -- to the chagrin of the Baltimore Orioles -- Jose enjoyed 
his biggest day in the majors while replacing the ailing Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
He had four hits, including a two-run homer and a broken-bat single in the 
ninth that sealed Oakland's 6-4 victory, four runs batted in and two runs 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say his chances of playing tomorrow (Friday) are pretty good whether 
Rickey's back or not," A's Manager Tony La Russa said of Jose. "We'll find a 
place for him." 
</P>
<P>
Jose learned that he would be leading off when he arrived at Memorial Stadium 
for early hitting Thursday. "Sometimes, you don't work," he said. "But I try to 
keep ready all the time by working hard." 
</P>
<P>
That was the case early last season when Jose, 23, made the club in spring 
training with a .329 average and 17 RBI. His chance surfaced when Canseco broke 
the hamate bone in his left hand and did not play until after the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
Jose flopped in his first trial, however, hitting only .125 before being 
optioned to Class-AAA Tacoma, Wash., April 23. 
</P>
<P>
"The rope just wasn't very long," La Russa said. "We were playing short-handed 
as it was, and staying in there was a matter of producing. If he didn't get off 
quick, we couldn't afford to go with him. 
</P>
<P>
"On a club that didn't think it had a chance to win, he would have gotten a 
bunch of at-bats, but we just didn't have that luxury." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Stan Javier settled in for Canseco and did a creditable job through 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel nervous now," Jose said. "I know I can do the job. I believe a 
lot in myself. I feel more comfortable this year because I know I've got a 
chance to stay in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
His teammates are trying to smooth the transitional period for the Dominican 
switch hitter, who had a superb winter league season in his native country. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to help him with what I can," Rickey Henderson said. "I get a kick out 
of seeing anybody do well." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said that there is a good chance he can play against the Boston Red 
Sox Friday night "but they'll probably keep me out another day now." 
</P>
<P>
Jose, who can play all the outfield positions, had one faux pas in the game -- 
when Steve Finley's drive caromed off his glove and was scored as a hit in the 
ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The play stopped Dennis Eckersley's streak of 18 Orioles retired. 
</P>
<P>
"I got it right there," Jose said, "and it rolled off the glove." 
</P>
<P>
He already has learned one thing. When his drive off Jay Tibbs soared toward 
the right-field seats in the seventh, Jose stared at the ball admiringly, 
Reggie Jackson style. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the wind was blowing a little," he said. "I knew I had gotten it." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa is ready to look for more spots for Jose because "this usually doesn't 
work this way. It just shows what kind of depth we have. We never have to 
apologize for any team we put out there. 
</P>
<P>
"The more you do, the more chances you get."

Gary Koch shot a 67 Friday to take a one-stroke lead over Mark O'Meara after 
two rounds of the rain-delayed USF&amp;G tournament at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Rain delayed play for two hours and forced suspension of the second round with 
23 golfers on the course. 
</P>
<P>
They were scheduled to finish their rounds today before the start of the third 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Koch, who finished Thursday's first round a stroke off the lead at 70, parred 
his first three holes Friday, then made the first of his five birdies on the 
par-4 13th hole, his fourth of the day. 
</P>
<P>
He was at seven-under-par 137 after two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara, one of four tied at 69 after Thursday's first round, shot another 69 
Friday, overcoming a poor front nine with a 30 on the back side. 
</P>
<P>
First-day leaders Brian Tennyson and Steve Elkington shot 70s Friday and were 
tied with Corey Pavin at 139. Pavin shot a 67 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Funk, one of the four first-day leaders, was among those still on the 
course when play was suspended because of darkness. He was four under after 14 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Byrum shot a 66, the best round of the tournament, and was in a six-way 
tie at 142. He completed his round during particularly bad weather in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament director Tommy Wulff said it was just typical New Orleans springtime 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like if there's a tournament in New Orleans, and it's the Classic, 
there's going to be rain," Wulff said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember a tournament where there hasn't been rain some time in the 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Beard, battling wind and rain at Stonebriar Country Club in Frisco, Tex., 
shot a six-under par 66 to take the first-round lead in the Murata Reunion 
Pro-Am. Two shots back were Bobby Nichols and Walt Zembriski.

LIVING MOSTLY TO PLAY BASEBALL, PAPE HELPS VALLEY TEAM SPRING BACK TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that E. J. Pape likes baseball is somewhat akin to saying that Captain 
Ahab took a passing interest in white whales. 
</P>
<P>
Pape's mania is that he can't stand being held to one hit. Baseball is his 
alpha and omega, his raison d'etre. Call him dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really say I have any interests other than baseball," said Pape, a 
sophomore second baseman at Valley. "I'll do things like I'll play golf, go 
bowling or something, but my life is baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Call him focused. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never a great athlete in high school," Pape said. "I can't do nothing 
but swing a bat and play some defense. I can't shoot a basket very well, I 
can't throw a pass, I can't skate." 
</P>
<P>
Call him nuts. 
</P>
<P>
"My room is filled with nothing but baseball," said Pape, who has devoted one 
wall to his hero, Brian Downing. "Some people say it's not healthy, but I try 
to surround myself with nothing but baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, it's not that Pape doesn't have other interests. He likes to read -- about 
baseball. He has a hobby -- collecting baseball bats. He hopes someday to 
become a doctor -- "if I can't be a ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
Patients, have patience: Pape's ballplaying days appear far from over. With a 
.340 batting average, 52 runs batted in and six home runs, he has helped a 
surging Valley team (16-19-2, 10-9) climb into fourth place in the Western 
State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Valley lost five of its first seven WSC games but has won 10 of its past 15, 
and Pape is working on a 16-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
A four-year starter at Burroughs High, Pape began his college career at USC. He 
soon learned how difficult it is to walk on to the Trojan baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
As what is known as a "recruited walk-on," Pape spent a semester at USC but 
didn't receive the scholarship assistance he had been told might be available. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved USC," said the earnestly friendly Pape. "You've got a great baseball 
facility. You've got great coaches down there. To me, USC is one of the best 
places to play ball." 
</P>
<P>
However, tuition became prohibitive, and Pape matriculated to Valley for the 
1989 spring baseball season. His USC baseball experience had been heady -- he 
played alongside the likes of Bret Boone and Damon Buford during fall workouts 
-- but at USC he also learned how to use his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of high school I was an average student; I got my Bs and Cs, mostly Cs," 
Pape said. "One thing I cannot thank USC enough for is teaching me how to study 
and making me a better student." 
</P>
<P>
In a study-skills program designed for athletes, Pape learned the basics of 
managing time, note-taking, underlining texts, tape-recording classes, and 
writing papers. Now, Pape says he carries a 3.7 grade-point average and usually 
takes more than 20 units a semester at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw myself out of high school being, I don't know, maybe a gas station 
attendant or something," Pape said. "Believe it or not, I enjoy doing the 
schoolwork now. Before I used to hate it." 
</P>
<P>
Pape, 20, plans to major in biology at a four-year school. He has not ruled out 
returning to Troy, but USC has yet to recruit him. UCLA and Arizona recently 
have shown interest, but there may be complications in transferring to another 
Pacific 10 Conference school after his stint at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge has made no secret of its interest. Coach Bill Kernen 
offered a scholarship when Pape was in high school and, according to Pape, the 
offer still stands. 
</P>
<P>
"He could very easily have hated me because I turned him down once," Pape said. 
"I would like to play for him, but I can't flat out say I'm going to play 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Having Pape at Northridge would simplify matters for his family. His parents 
have attended every game E. J. has played for Burroughs and Valley. His sister 
Shelly, a Valley freshman who Pape says is "like a best friend," keeps score at 
his games. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Papes are well-prepared for travel. Ed Pape Sr. (E. J. stands for 
Ed Jr.) earned his pilot's license when E.J. went to USC just so he could fly 
the family to E. J.'s away games. 
</P>
<P>
Pape pere may be mobile, but Valley Coach Chris Johnson believes E. J.'s 
limited mobility will force Pape to play either third or first base at higher 
levels. Pape already has played so many positions at Valley that he takes three 
gloves -- infielder's, outfielder's and first baseman's -- to every game. 
Hitting is Pape's forte. A stocky 5-feet-11 and 180 pounds, he does not have a 
classic power hitter's build, but he hits more ropes than Tarzan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not try to hit the ball deep but ever since I was in high school I've 
always hit the ball out of the ballpark," said Pape, who clubbed nine home runs 
last spring. "My main goal is to drive in RBIs. I love to drive in RBIs. My 
biggest thing is doubles." 
</P>
<P>
His confidence in his hitting is so absolute, Pape talks of playing in the 
minor leagues in terms of when, not if. 
</P>
<P>
"He believes in himself," said John Stephens, Valley's third baseman. 
"Definitely not one to not believe in himself. He has high expectations of 
himself, really high." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pape's numbers are similar to those he posted last season, Johnson 
says Pape has been more consistent this spring. According to Johnson, the curve 
no longer throws Pape for a loop, and he has worked to straighten out his 
mental approach to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Through a lot of long talks, he's made some great progress in just playing the 
game," Johnson said. "He had a little trouble being a baseball player in this 
way: He was paralyzed by the future. 'Where am I going? What am I doing? What 
school will I sign with? . . .' He got so worried about the future, he forgot 
about the present." 
</P>
<P>
Pape's analysis paralysis was not reflected in his statistics last year. He hit 
.376 with 46 RBIs and had a 15-game hitting streak before a late-season wrist 
injury, but he knew he needed a new attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to grow a little bit," Pape said, "If you get out or boot something it's 
not the end of the world. (Johnson) just rode me. All year from Day One till 
now he has been on me to basically grow up." 
</P>
<P>
A relatively quiet guy on the field, Pape tends to retreat within himself after 
a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a freshman, I get a lot of first impressions. . . . Truth is, I didn't 
know about E. J. He was all right; he was a friendly guy but when something 
would go wrong he would be all quiet," Valley shortstop Chad Ratliff said. "You 
can see he really holds it in. He sits in the dugout and doesn't say a word. I 
think it's a lot of concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Valley, there haven't been many silent spells from Pape or his 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
"He hits a ton," Ratliff said. "I like him when he's up there (at the plate) 
because I always think he's going to come through." 
</P>
<P>
Call him a player.

Cal Lutheran blew a 4-0 lead en route to a 7-4 loss to Biola in a nonconference 
NAIA District 3 baseball game Friday at Biola. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 4-0, after seven innings, Cal Lutheran (23-11, 10-7 in district play) 
pulled starting pitcher Mike Clark because of an 85-pitch limit imposed by the 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Clark entered the game with 22 consecutive shutout innings and a 3-0 record 
against Biola. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed only four hits and did not walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
However, three relief pitchers could not protect the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's Peter Washington was three for five with a solo home run in the 
seventh inning. Bob Keller had two doubles and three runs batted in to lead 
Biola (13-27, 4-16). 
</P>
<P>
In order to earn a playoff berth, the Kingsmen need to win one of their next 
three District 3 games.

Moorpark 10, Santa Monica 0 -- After losing a Western State Conference game at 
home for the first time in seven years on Wednesday, Moorpark bounced back 
against visiting Santa Monica in a game shortened to five innings because of 
the mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave Moorpark (25-9, 12-1) a share of its fourth consecutive conference 
title and its sixth in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman right-hander Robin Thomas (23-6) limited Santa Monica (5-7 in 
conference play) to four hits and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Missy Cress hit her third home run, a three-run shot, in Moorpark's 
five-run fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons 5, Pierce 1 -- For the second time this week, Canyons held a WSC 
opponent to one hit. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Ruffner threw a one-hitter Wednesday, and freshman right-hander 
Rebecca Schuster held visiting Pierce to a double in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Schuster (3-1) struck out three and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Greenwood, Debbie Rendall, Kelly Kepplinger, Debbie Barnard and Roxana 
Marta all had two hits for Canyons (20-19, 5-8).

<P>
Marty Beck won the 400-meter intermediate hurdles in a meet-record 51.84 
seconds and placed second in the 400 in 47.59 to highlight Glendale College's 
second-place finish in the Western State Conference track and field finals 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, despite being forced to scratch from the long jump because of shin 
splints, helped anchor the Vaquero 1,600 relay team to a third-place finish 
with a 46.2 leg and was named the male athlete of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield successfully defended its WSC title with 224 points, followed by 
Glendale (148) and Ventura (101), Cuesta (94) and Moorpark (88). 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield also won its second consecutive title in the women's division with 
183 points. Ventura finished second with 120 and Glendale was third with 115 
1/2. Moorpark and Valley placed fourth and fifth with 113 and 102 points, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Clarke of Valley was named the women's field event athlete of the meet 
after winning the high jump (5-4) and long jump (17-11 3/4) and placing second 
in the 400 (55.39) and fourth in the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield received a big boost from Juan Romero, who surged to victory in the 
5,000 meters in 15 minutes 11.8 seconds. Glendale's James Moore finished 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"I only felt 90% tonight," said Moore, who outkicked Romero in a 10,000-meter 
race Tuesday in which he set a personal best. "I didn't feel 100% like I did in 
the 10,000." 
</P>
<P>
Moore ran 15:21.35 in the 5,000. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Beck, bound for UCLA, and Phil Simpson (54.90) led a 1-2 Glendale finish in the 
400 hurdles. Beck bettered the meet record of 51.9 by Dwayne Wycoff (1980) and 
Rick Steele (1975), both of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with the way we ran on the track, but Bakersfield was too strong 
in the field events," Glendale Coach Tom McMurray said of the men's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1,500, Glendale picked up 21 points, placing four runners among 
the top seven, and also scored 20 points in the 800, but there was some 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Rick Provenzano, who has the fastest time in the conference at 
1:52.01, placed a distant seventh in 1:57 in the 800. However, teammates Nick 
Lugo and Derrick Mitchell placed first and second in 1:56.73 and 1:56.93. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Galindo of Ventura led until the last 100 of the 1,500 when Provenzano 
passed him to win in 3:59.29. Galindo placed second in 3:59.60. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Ryan Rapoza won the javelin with a toss of 202 feet 4 inches to

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
KENNY BLACK IS HAPPY TO BE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even though sixth place was the best Kenny Black could manage with his three 
mounts, it was a gratifying return for the jockey Friday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"In the post parade for the first race, people were yelling things like, 'Go 
get 'em, Kenny' and 'Glad to have you back,' " he said. "It was nice. I even 
got a small standing ovation." 
</P>
<P>
Corey Black's older brother, 26, hadn't ridden locally since 1984, except for 
two mounts in 1986. A regular in the top 10, he tested positive for cocaine in 
the summer of '84 and developed a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
That winter, he was suspended by the stewards and has been something of a 
vagabond since. Over the years, he has ridden at such outposts as St. George 
and Beaver, Utah; Globe, Ariz., and Farmington, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Married and the father of two, Black says he is a changed man and hopes to 
become a Southland fixture again. Always in a battle with weight, he rode at 
119 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After riding at the New Mexico State Fair in Albuquerque last fall, Black 
served as his brother's agent briefly, then started exercising horses in hopes 
of making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
He had a hearing before an officer of the California Horse Racing Board last 
month, then was granted his jockey's license earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've matured tons," he said after completing his first day back. 
</P>
<P>
He finished ninth with 40-1 shot Notice Me Baby in the first race, 12th and 
last with 109-1 outsider Current Climate in the second and sixth on 25-1 shot 
Showerstime, who had the lead until tiring in the final eighth of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making excuses or anything, but I was 18, driving a Porsche, making 
$300,000-$400,000 a year and living in a half-million-dollar house," Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was life in the fast lane and 90% of the people in the fast lane back then 
did drugs. It was the 'in' thing. I wasn't uncommon. I was going to do what I 
wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a complete family man now and I like it. When I married Kelly (two years 
ago) and had two kids, I realized how much I was missing. Kelly turned my life 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was Corey's agent, it really wasn't me. I really got the itch again. I 
want to give my family the things they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
Black, who has hired Vince DeGregory as his agent, is named on three more 
horses today -- Rosie's Lord Tudor, Gorbot and Gum Swapper -- and has two calls 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A head better than Bruho in the El Rincon Handicap in his second start of the 
year, Steinlen will spot six rivals nine to 16 pounds in the $110,000 Shoemaker 
Handicap Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly named the Premiere, the Shoemaker will be run at a mile on the turf, 
the same course where Steinlen had three seconds and a victory in four starts 
last year. After being beaten a nose by Mister Wonderful in the American 
Handicap last July 4, the Habitat horse rattled off five consecutive victories 
en route to his Eclipse Award as the nation's top turf performer. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos, who has ridden the 7-year-old in his last six races, will be 
aboard Sunday as Steinlen carries 126 pounds, one more than in the El Rincon. 
</P>
<P>
The horse he may have to fear most is Super May, who has blossomed in recent 
months for Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
A 4-year-old son of Super Concorde, Super May has won four consecutive races, 
most recently a three-quarter length decision over Royal Reach in the Santa 
Gertrudes April 7. Royal Reach returned to capture the San Jacinto, the 
closing-day feature at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis will again ride Super May, who had a nightmarish trip in his only 
other try on the Hollywood Park grass as a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Drysdale will be represented by Nediym, who has been rested since a 
disappointing try in Bill Shoemaker's final race Feb. 4, and Saudi Desert, who 
was beaten at 4-5 in a Santa Anita allowance race. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky, Shining Steel was well beaten in the 
El Rincon when he took off early. He's much more effective coming from behind, 
as shown in his four-length victory March 17. 
</P>
<P>
Preston and Brave Capade, who are also entered in the seventh race today, are 
the other scheduled Shoemaker contestants. 
</P>
<P>
Three days into the meeting, Kent Desormeaux tops the jockey standings after 
three winners Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth at Santa Anita, even though he didn't compete in California until 
mid-February, Desormeaux won the second race with favored Gibson's Choice, the 
fifth on 9-1 longshot Cookie Bear and the seventh with Final Frontier. He has 
five wins and four seconds in 18 mounts in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye and Pat Valenzuela each won twice Friday. Delahoussaye took 
the feature on Dachi's Folly, who rallied from far behind, and the ninth with 
7-1 outsider Chief's Image. Valenzuela scored aboard Pocketful of Class in the 
fourth and Provident Ruler, a 12-1 longshot, in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Stormy But Valid, who is tough on any surface, returns to the dirt today in the 
$107,300 A Gleam Handicap at seven furlongs. Trained by Brian Mayberry, the 
4-year-old Valid Appeal filly has won seven of 17 while earning $324,600. She 
will be ridden by Gary Stevens and has five opponents -- Hot Novel, Sugarplum 
Gal, Inverness Lady, What Has Been and Tis Juliet. . . . John Sadler is the 
early leader in the trainers' race with three victories. He had two Friday -- 
Gibson's Choice and Pocketful of Class.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;

<P>
TATUM STARTS GROSSMONT WITH 2 HOMERS IN INNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santana Coach Jim Saska will breath a sigh of relief when John Tatum graduates 
from Grossmont this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tatum drove in four of Grossmont's eight runs in the third inning with two 
homers, and the Foothillers went on to an 18-6 victory in a Grossmont 2-A 
League game Thursday at Santana. 
</P>
<P>
The victory broke a first-place league tie, leaving Grossmont (20-2, 3-0) on 
top by itself. Santana is 16-4 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate pitching to John," Saska said. "I don't know how to get him out. Throw 
him a curveball, and he'll bang it out that way. Throw him a fastball, and 
he'll bang it out this way. He's been tearing me up for two years." 
</P>
<P>
This was Tatum's second two-homer game of the season -- the first was against 
San Pasqual -- but he has never hit two in an inning. He added a two-run double 
to finish with six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Leading off the third, Tatum hit the first home run to tie it at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Early reached first on a single. Rob Roberson reached first on a fielding 
error by right fielder Ferdi Hollis. Danny Lennon doubled, scoring Early. Mark 
Landers hit a two-run double, giving Grossmont a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont then loaded the bases, and Todd Cady singled, scoring Landers. With 
runners on first and third and two outs, Tatum hit his second homer to make it 
9-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't thinking home run," Tatum said. "With two guys on, I just wanted to 
move somebody over." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Kenny Ervin replaced Chad Barry on the mound for Santana. But he 
was subsequently replaced by Robert Ervin after walking three batters to load 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
With Cady up, Lennon scored on a balk. Cady walked, and Tatum hit a two-run 
double that bounced over the fence. Cady went home on a passed ball by Lance 
McClure to make it 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not 12 runs better than Santana," Grossmont Coach Jeff Meredith said. 
"We know that, and they know that." LAURA PALMER

CHRYSLER AIR BAG SPOT CALLED A SMASH HIT; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: THE DRAMATIC CRASH AD, THE FIRST TO USE A REAL PERSON INSTEAD OF A 
DUMMY, PERSUADED THE STUNT DRIVER TO TRADE IN HIS FORD BRONCO FOR A CAR WITH 
THE SAFETY DEVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For Roger Richman, fame came only after he hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Richman is that guy in the Chrysler TV commercial who nonchalantly buckles 
himself into a Plymouth Acclaim, then drives it smack into a concrete, 
steel-enforced wall at 21 m.p.h. That might not sound like much, but experts 
say that's the rough equivalent of hitting another moving car at 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The highly dramatic commercial -- the first one to ever replace a crash dummy 
with a real person -- was filmed last month on a landing strip at Inyokern 
Airport in Kern County, about 150 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The ad promotes Chrysler's placement of air bags in all of its American-built 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
Richman, a 37-year-old Hollywood Hills resident and professional stunt driver, 
said the mental and physical impact of driving that car into the wall has 
persuaded him to trade in his Ford Bronco for a car with air bags. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that I was strictly a live piece of meat," said Richman, who is 
employed by Hollywood-based Drivers Inc. "But it's rare that we stunt drivers 
get to do something that might benefit mankind. How many lives have been saved 
by watching stunt drivers on 'The A-Team' or 'Starsky &amp; Hutch?' " 
</P>
<P>
More than altruism attracted him to appear in the commercial. Besides the pay 
-- which he declined to reveal -- the ad represented that one chance in a 
million for a stunt driver to get his mug on TV. Stunt drivers' faces are 
rarely shown in films or on television because they're standing in for another 
actor. But this time, Richman was no one but himself. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30-second ad, Richman, dressed in street clothes, walks up to a Plymouth 
Acclaim, opens the driver's door and tosses out a crash dummy. He then sits in 
the driver's seat, buckles his seat belt and proceeds to drive his car into a 
specially built, steel-reinforced concrete wall, without so much as wincing. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to act as if I didn't know what was coming," said Richman, who 
used only standard lap and shoulder restraints. "So I tried to defocus my 
vision to not see the wall." 
</P>
<P>
The car used in the stunt was right off a dealer's lot and was not specially 
prepared in any way. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds before the crash, tension on the set was great. "We were naturally 
quite concerned about safety," said Sidney Rothberg, executive producer of 
Werner Hlinka Products, which filmed the ad created by the Minneapolis office 
of Bozell Inc. "Not only would we have contributed to injuring the driver, but 
the negative publicity surrounding such an accident would have been disastrous 
both for our company and for Chrysler." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately upon impact, Richman's air bag exploded open and completely 
cushioned the blow, but Richman hardly remembers it. "I didn't even realize 
that the bag came out," he said. "It all happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Richman steps out of the car, unharmed. "If you're looking at 
a Japanese car, see if it's got an air bag," says an off-camera narrator. "Then 
ask yourself if you can live without one." 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics stood by, just in case something went wrong. They also examined 
Richman immediately after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest hit I've ever taken in my career," Richman said. "I never 
thought I'd die from the crash, but if the bag had failed, I knew broken bones 
and internal injuries were likely." 
</P>
<P>
Just in case all six cameras filming the crash somehow missed the impact, 
another Acclaim was waiting on the set for him to try it a second time. 
</P>
<P>
And what if Richman -- who is single -- had chickened out? Well, even Chrysler 
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, a longtime opponent of air bags who only recently 
became an air bag cheerleader, was considered at one time. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was first reviewing the concept for the commercial, he laughingly 
volunteered," said Joe Hickey, Chrysler's manager of corporate advertising. But 
Iacocca wasn't there for the filming of the ad, although he did send Richman a 
thank-you note. 
</P>
<P>
Richman has since received plenty of other correspondence. Several advertisers 
have asked him to ram cars into walls for them too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm being called the Hollywood crash dummy," said Richman. He jokingly 
recalled what went through his mind moments before he hit the wall: "Is it too 
late to become a CPA?"

PLANNED LAYOFFS AT MCDONNELL LEAVE TOOLMAKERS UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toolmakers on the McDonnell Douglas C-17 cargo jet program are in an uproar 
over an apparent company plan to lay off some American employees but retain 
British employees who were brought in on visas under the claim that the company 
could not find any Americans to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy comes just as McDonnell Douglas and other aerospace firms are 
starting massive layoffs in response to defense budget cuts and to improve 
their financial performance. McDonnell said Thursday that it would lay off 
3,000 white-collar workers at its Douglas Aircraft plant in Long Beach, an 
action unrelated to the toolmakers. 
</P>
<P>
With work dwindling everywhere in the industry, the American toolmakers say 
they will be hard-pressed to find new employment, and they are outraged that a 
defense firm would retain foreign workers in such a downturn. The dispute 
points up the rising level of tension among workers amid the approaching 
defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are so-called contract toolmakers or job shoppers, who work under 
contract at McDonnell Douglas through an outside placement firm. Douglas 
employs about 160 contract workers on the Air Force C-17 cargo jet program. In 
addition, Douglas has 70 British toolmakers who are regular company employees 
and about 120 other toolmakers who are employees but not British. 
</P>
<P>
An internal memorandum, obtained by The Times on Friday, indicates that company 
officials were weighing the consequences of laying off the contractors as early 
as last January. The memo said management would have to take into consideration 
the "political objections by some contractors if we retain too many UKs 
(British toolmakers) and terminate American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The memo indicated that various management departments within Douglas were 
seeking "an agreement on how many (British) we want to keep as opposed to how 
many American contractors we want to keep." The concern was that "UKs cost less 
than contractors." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the memo said, "We must reduce head count ASAP (as soon as 
possible)." It also indicated that C-17 executives had ordered a 15% cut in 
overtime pay. Last year, some toolmakers were working as many as 70 to 80 hours 
per week. 
</P>
<P>
A Douglas spokesman said Friday: "No layoff notices have been issued at this 
time. The only contractors who have been laid off until this time were let go 
because they were marginal or for not following company rules." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the British workers are "regular employees and union 
members" and added, "Our agreement with the union requires that we let a 
contract person go before a union worker." 
</P>
<P>
But union officials said their position is to support the contract toolmakers, 
not the British. 
</P>
<P>
"The British must go because they are imported workers, and American workers 
have the first right to those jobs," said Douglas Griffith, president of United 
Auto Workers Local 148, which represents Douglas toolmakers. "It is my 
understanding that there has been two or three court decisions that imported 
workers cannot be in place while a company displaces American workers." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith emphasized that he had no information that the company was actually 
planning to lay off any workers, since Douglas still has many tools to make for 
its C-17 and MD-11 aircraft programs. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said Douglas paid $400,000 to a San Francisco law firm earlier this 
year to help resolve a problem when the State Department declined to extend the 
British workers' visas. Griffith said the union helped get the visas extended 
because it was convinced that Douglas was having a hard time finding American 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no objection from us in terms of needing those people when we had 
evidence that the company made a countrywide search," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But a Douglas supervisor who has been concerned about the use of British 
workers said there are adequate numbers of American toolmakers, but they have 
not been hired by Douglas. The American contract workers are worried. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all just waiting for the ax to fall," said Joseph Murray, a 15-year 
aircraft industry veteran at Douglas. "I haven't been formally notified, but 
the handwriting is on the wall."

SANTA BARBARA SAVINGS SEIZED BY REGULATORS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE TROUBLED FIRM HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR MONTHS UNDER SOME OF THE 
TOUGHEST RESTRICTIONS EVER IMPOSED ON AN INSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators on Friday seized the long-troubled Santa Barbara Savings, 
the state's 18th-largest thrift and the dominant savings and loan in the Santa 
Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo region. 
</P>
<P>
The move had been expected for months. Over the past five months, Santa Barbara 
Savings had been placed under some of the most severe restrictions regulators 
have ever imposed on a thrift short of seizing it. The thrift could not make a 
new loan or make new investments, restrictions considered tantamount to a death 
sentence for a savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is solvent, Santa Barbara failed to meet new federal capital rules, 
and its chances for ever doing so were slim. Those rules, put into place last 
year in the wake of the nation's savings and loan fiasco, are designed to make 
sure thrifts maintain enough financial protection against losses. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are not expected to notice any difference in operations as a result 
of the seizure. Branches will remain open during regular hours. Accounts are 
insured up to $100,000, the federal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara Savings and its parent, Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara, which 
had $4.66 billion in assets on Dec. 31, have a bizarre history marked by a 
number of missteps by management in the early to mid-1980s and the involvement 
at one point of one of Wall Street's most notorious felons. From 1981 to 1984, 
the thrift lost more than $80 million and was nearly wiped out. The thrift lost 
$60.3 million in 1989 but posted a profit of $37.7 million in the first quarter 
because it swapped stock for junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift never maintained a strong capital level and put its depositor money 
in ill-timed investments. They included risky junk bonds, Treasury securities 
and futures contracts on Treasury securities, which is a method of hedging 
against losses in value. On Friday, regulators cited "extremely thin interest 
margins and low-yielding assets" but did not elaborate. They also said expenses 
were too high. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan F. Boesky, the Wall Street stock speculator who pleaded guilty in 1986 to 
insider trading violations, came within a shade of buying Financial Corp. of 
Santa Barbara in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky had proposed buying 56% of the firm for $40 million through one of his 
firms but later backed out because of problems getting federal approval and a 
rise in interest rates. Last fall, Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara sued Boesky 
and Drexel Burnham Lambert, the collapsed investment bank that specialized in 
junk bonds, alleging that they concealed their relationships when they 
persuaded the thrift to buy $284 million in junk bonds in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara's largest shareholder now is Beverly Hills 
lawyer and businessman Leonard Ross, who owns a stake of slightly more than 
20%. Ross could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's management tried unsuccessfully to sell the S&amp;L. One 
institution that took a look was San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp., sources 
familiar with the thrift said. 
</P>
<P>
But any investor would have had to pump considerable money into Santa Barbara 
Savings. Sources said regulators probably would have required an infusion of 
$100 million to $300 million, depending on the financial strength of the buyer. 
And many buyers were scared off by Santa Barbara's portfolio of such 
investments as mortgage-backed securities. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the federal Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created last year 
to clean up the nation's savings and loan mess, will run the thrift while a 
buyer is sought.

<P>
The stock market wilted Friday under fresh signs that inflation is rising 
sharply, sending stock prices sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 31.53 to 2,645.05, extending its 
drop for the week to 50.90 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 2 to 
1 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 403 up, 
1,070 down and 491 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 130.63 million shares, down from Thursday's 141.33 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Before the trading day began, the Commerce Department estimated that the gross 
national product grew at a 2.1% annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
An accompanying gauge of inflation showed prices in the January-March period 
rising at a 7 1/2-year high of 5.7% annually. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said those figures tended to reinforce fears on Wall Street that the 
Federal Reserve might soon feel compelled to tighten credit, to keep inflation 
in check. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors, including weak corporate earnings, weighed on the market, 
traders and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rates are rising, and there is slowing corporate profitability and continued 
credit quality problems," said Kenneth Spence, director of technical analysis 
at Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates were mixed in the credit markets. Brokers said some bond traders 
were a little relieved that the GNP increase wasn't any bigger than it turned 
out to be. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp dropped 1/2 to 21 7/8 in active trading on word that Standard &amp; 
Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on most of the firm's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chip industrials included Exxon, down 5/8 at 45; IBM, 
down 1 3/8 at 107 3/8; Philip Morris, down 7/8 at 41 1/2, and McDonald's, down 
1/4 at 30 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Microsystems rose 3/4 to 23 3/4 in the over-the-counter market. Late 
Thursday, Sun reported earnings for its fiscal quarter ended March 30 of 40 
cents a share, up from 38 cents a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Teradata tumbled 4 to 24 1/2 despite reporting quarterly earnings of 42 cents a 
share versus 1 cent a year ago. The L.A.-based computer company said it is 
facing softness in some European markets, and that it is monitoring the trend 
"very closely." 
</P>
<P>
Financial services firm Broad Inc. also fell, losing 3/8 to 7 5/8, despite 
higher earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop sank 5/8 to 15 1/8 on word of further defense cutbacks. Teledyne, 
another defense contractor, continued to plunge, off 1 3/8 to 27, a 52-week 
low. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed higher after wild fluctuations 
ranging about 200 points. The Nikkei 225-share index, which lost 139.78 points 
Thursday, gained 160.22 points to end the week at 29,584.80. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices fell sharply on London's Stock Exchange, depressed by the 
disappointing U.S. economic figures. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 
27 points to close at 2,106.6.

Bond Prices Edge Up in Slow Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose slightly in light trading as the market shrugged off the 
government report showing strong economic growth and rising inflation. But long 
Treasury bond yields remained above 9%. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose 5/32 point, or $1.56 for each 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dipped to 9.02% 
from 9.04% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, down from 8.188% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Early Dollar Rally Turns Into Decline 
</P>
<P>
The dollar declined against most major currencies in trading dominated by the 
West German mark and Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
News that inflation has picked up this year initially caused heavy dollar 
buying, but it tapered off in late morning. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar traded within a narrow range as most 
of the buying and selling interest was directed toward the mark and yen. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, the day was dominated by cross-trading, particularly the mark-yen," 
said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Traders snapped up dollars in the morning after the government released the 
inflation report. 
</P>
<P>
They bought on the assumption that the Federal Reserve Board might step up its 
battle against inflation by pursuing a tighter credit policy, which would lead 
to higher interest rates. Higher rates would boost returns on 
dollar-denominated investments and tend to increase demand for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But the buying enthusiasm soon waned. Traders apparently concluded that the 
central bank wouldn't adjust its policy in the immediate future. Activity 
typically slows on Fridays because traders prefer not to establish significant 
new positions ahead of a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's trading day began in Tokyo where it rose to 159.08 Japanese yen 
from 158.77 on Thursday. Later in London, it fell to 158.80. By the time 
trading was done for the day in New York, the dollar had risen to 159.30 yen 
from 159.23 late Thursday.

Soybean Prices Still Heading Higher

Soybean futures prices surged to their highest levels since last summer, 
extending a rally linked to the rain-slowed Brazilian harvest and fears that 
the recent hot, dry Midwestern weather might be a harbinger of drought.

On other commodity markets, grain futures ended mixed, cattle were higher; pork 
futures were mixed; oil futures were mixed, and precious metals were mixed.

TECHNICAL GLITCH SHUTS 5 N.Y. FUTURES MARKETS

<P>
The five New York futures and options markets shut down early on Friday after a 
communications glitch prevented thousands of traders, brokers and investors 
from receiving price data. 
</P>
<P>
Action in the nation's major oil and metals trading pits came to a standstill 
when the exchanges discovered that no price quotes were leaving the building. 
</P>
<P>
Exchanges employees and participants said it was the first time in recent 
memory that the markets were closed because of a technical problem. Traders 
reported no panic and an orderly shutdown. Some players took an early weekend. 
Trading was halted at 11:20 a.m. at the New York Commodity Exchange, the 
nation's main metals market; the New York Mercantile Exchange, the main oil 
trading market; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the Cotton Exchange, and 
the New York Futures Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The problem involved communication lines inside the exchange at the World Trade 
Center in lower Manhattan and prevented price quotations from being transferred 
from the trading floor to computer screens in the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"The high-speed futures line is dead," Tom Crisalli, an operations employee 
with the Commodity Exchange Center, which oversees the five futures markets, 
said early Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to resolve the problem, the exchanges shut down at 2 p.m. after giving 
traders a few minutes to settle pending deals. The regular closing times for 
most commodities run from 2:20 p.m. until around 3 p.m. The New York Stock 
Exchange composite index-futures contract continued to trade until its normal 
4:15 p.m. close. 
</P>
<P>
Employees said the system began transmitting data again at 2:49 p.m. Officials 
said the exchanges would reopen Monday. But the exact cause of the glitch 
remained unclear.

PENNSYLVANIA GETS NATION'S STRICTEST ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Robert P. Casey on Friday signed the nation's toughest anti-takeover law, 
saying it would discourage corporate raiders from stripping jobs and economic 
vitality from Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, the law was challenged by two suits filed in federal court that 
claimed unconstitutional infringement on shareholder and investor rights. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect that the law, which took effect immediately, will create 
ripples in boardrooms and legislatures throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in any state, raiders will be forced to surrender short-term 
profits from thwarted takeover attempts. The law also restricts the voting 
rights of raiders and preserves labor contracts when corporations change hands. 
</P>
<P>
Hostile takeovers have cost Pennsylvania thousands of jobs and such corporate 
mainstays as Gulf Oil Co., which closed its headquarters in Pittsburgh after it 
was merged with Chevron Corp. The AFL-CIO estimates that 90,000 jobs were lost 
nationwide over the last decade because of mergers, takeovers and leveraged 
buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Casey signed the bill at the City Council chambers blocks from the corporate 
headquarters of Armstrong World Industries, the floor-covering manufacturer 
that the legislation was first drafted to protect. 
</P>
<P>
Its enactment comes three days before Armstrong's annual stockholder meeting, 
where the Belzberg family of Canada plans to wage a proxy fight to place four 
of its representatives on the company's board. 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed on behalf of the Belzbergs in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia 
alleges that the law conflicts with federal legislation and violates the First 
and Fifth amendments of the Constitution.

LINEUP FOR BLUES FESTIVAL SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an environment perked up by performances from pianist Dr. John, singer Irma 
Thomas, guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan and singer/harmonica player John Mayall, 
the lineup for Benson and Hedges Blues, a weeklong blues festival to be held in 
the Southland in June, was announced Thursday at a press conference at the 
China Club in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Blues greats B. B. King and John Lee Hooker, along with John, Vaughan and many 
Los Angeles area musicians -- Doug MacLeod, Bernie Pearl and Jimmy and Jeannie 
Cheatham among them -- will take part in the festival, which will feature 10 
performances from June 4-10 at area venues from Banger's in Tarzana to Marla's 
Memory Lane in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The event is highlighted by a concert with King, Hooker, Joe Cocker, John and 
others at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on June 9. The concert is also 
a benefit, as $1 from each ticket sold will go to Shelter Partnership Inc., an 
umbrella organization which aids a variety of groups that deal with the 
homeless in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
This marks the first year that Los Angeles is a site for B&amp;H Blues, a 
combination of free and ticketed events which is presented in five cities this 
year and which debuted in St. Louis, Atlanta and New York in 1988. "We have met 
with such great response in the cities where we've held Benson and Hedges Blues 
that we wanted to expand to new markets," said Jane Yusko, manager of the 
festival for B&amp;H. "We chose Los Angeles because of its heritage in the 
rhythm and blues field." 
</P>
<P>
The firm decided to sponsor the blues festivals, which are produced by George 
Wein's Festival Productions, because "We want to bring the blues to the 
forefront of the music scene," Yusko said. "This music is historically 
important. It's at the basis of so much of today's music." 
</P>
<P>
Blues musicians -- like King, who often expounds about the lack of awareness of 
blues music in this country -- are working with festival organizers, by being 
readily available for press interviews, for example, or by taking part in free 
workshops, to help bring the events off, Yusko said. "The musicians are taking 
this (festival) seriously," she said. "It's important music to them and I think 
that comes across in the festival." 
</P>
<P>
The festival begins June 4 with five "Stormy Monday" shows at five area venues, 
and includes other nightclub performances, a showing of blues films, a blues 
boat ride around the Los Angeles Harbor and a workshop on the art of blues 
songwriting. "We like to reach into different areas and have different programs 
to have community involvement and give it a festival atmosphere," Yusko said.

SOTHEBY'S CLAIMS LION'S SHARE OF PHOTOGRAPHY AUCTION TOTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A four-day marathon of photography auctions this week at Sotheby's and 
Christie's totalled $8.2 million in sales. Sotheby's claimed the lion's share, 
$5.6 million, the majority of it on Thursday in a $3.2-million auction of about 
500 photographs, portfolios and albums consigned by a variety of owners. 
</P>
<P>
The top lot was Henri le Secq's mid 19th-Century album of 60 photographs of 
French churches, bought for $220,000 by a consortium of three dealers, Harry 
Lunn, Robert Hershkowitz and Ezra Mack. Sotheby's had valued the album at 
$60,000 to $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
A volume of scenes from the Crimean War by Roger Fenton brought the sale's 
second highest price of $121,000, more than double its top estimate of $60,000. 
A 1907 photograph of a female nude torso by Clarence H. White and Alfred 
Stieglitz, valued at up to $70,000, sold for $93,500. 
</P>
<P>
While many prices escalated to new heights, bringing Thursday's $3.2-millon 
sale within Sotheby's estimated total of $2.6 million to $3.9 million, 121 lots 
failed to sell, including some of Robert Mapplethorpe's work. 
</P>
<P>
His prices seemed to have no limit last November, in the first big auctions 
after his death, but seven of the 22 works offered earlier in the week at 
Christie's didn't sell. 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's sale produced sharply mixed results for the controversial artist. One 
erotic work, "Thomas in a Box," brought $39,600, topping the $38,500 record for 
a single Mapplethorpe image set in November. But three of the 36 Mapplethorpes 
listed in the catalogue were withdrawn and six others failed to find buyers. 
One, a portrait of Hans Gjerd, attracted no bids at all. Sixteen works sold 
within Sotheby's estimated price range, while seven commanded higher prices and 
four went for less than the lowest estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe dealers generally insist that his market remains strong, but this 
week's sales indicate that interest has peaked and that his prices are leveling 
off if not falling.

AN UNUSUAL PAIRING PAYS OFF IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teaming of saxophonist Archie Shepp and bassist Red Callender at Cal State 
Long Beach's 25th annual Comparative Literature/Classics spring conference was 
inspired. However, it isn't exactly clear by what it was inspired -- even after 
hearing the odd couple's six-tune offering of "Relaxing at Camarillo: The Music 
of Charlie Parker." 
</P>
<P>
Shepp, a playwright and a professor of music at the University of 
Massachusetts, embraced the music of bebop only after making his name in the 
free jazz realm. Callender, a bassist who made his recording debut with Louis 
Armstrong and gave Charles Mingus his first bass lessons, has seen -- and done 
-- it all. As a pair, they were a little like an Englishman and an American in 
conversation -- speaking a common language but always divided. 
</P>
<P>
Shepp and Callender opened their concert with a reading of "Confirmation," a 
spirited, up-tempo tune from the Parker repertoire. Despite the rather hollow 
sound created by the lack of drums and piano, the twosome managed to imbue the 
piece with a solid bop flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Shepp played the tenor saxophone in two distinct, contrasting styles, both 
defined by range. On the lower end of the scale, he demonstrated a full, 
rounded sound that was softened by excessive hissing; on the high end, he 
possessed a thin, reedy tone. His improvisations tended to reflect his tone. 
During the Duke Ellington ballad "In a Sentimental Mood," he played soft and 
lovely, with warm burnished tones in the low register; on "Relaxing at 
Camarillo," he jumped into the high end with a series of urgent squeals and 
whines. 
</P>
<P>
Callender, through it all, played the masterful backup role as he gracefully 
provided deep, echoing tones that contrasted whatever Shepp was doing. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Callender's few solo moments were greatly diminished by Shepp's 
intrusive noodling at the piano. Though his piano work was passable on 
Thelonious Monk's " 'Round Midnight," it was generally disconcerting, his 
harmonic voicings in frequent conflict with Callender's solos and his time not 
on the mark. 
</P>
<P>
But there were moments to be savored, such as Callender's rendering of the 
Ellington piece on the tuba and the duo's splendid reading of Parker's 
"Yardbird Suite." Like politics, music can indeed make for strange bedfellows.

JIMMY HEATH QUARTET AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though it was not to be expected that Jimmy Heath's Quartet would fill the 
spacious Marsee Hall at El Camino College Thursday evening, what could be 
anticipated was a program of music diversified enough to sustain the interest 
and reaffirm the reputation of the 63-year-old tenor saxophonist. 
</P>
<P>
With them were his brother Tootie on drums, Ben Brown on bass and guitarist 
Tony Purrone, who for 12 years has been a virtual adopted brother of the 
musical Heath family. 
</P>
<P>
Heath's warm tone and personal vibrato placed him in a middle ground, 
post-Dexter Gordon but pre-John Coltrane. He brought buoyancy and spirit to "On 
the Trail," "Hi Fly" and his own composition "Sassy Samba" (written 10 years 
ago and dedicated to Sarah Vaughan). 
</P>
<P>
Variety was assured through Heath's occasional use of flute or soprano sax (the 
latter most effectively on "Round Midnight"), and by the always remarkable 
facility of Purrone, one of the most underrated guitarists on the 
mainstream-modern front. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Brown played a hand-held electric bass that was almost all neck and no 
body, producing a heavy, thudding sound, though his ideas at times transcended 
the instrument's built-in handicap. He and everyone else reached a zenith of 
excitement on the Sonny Red tune "Bluesville." 
</P>
<P>
Tootie Heath, always a propulsive and sensitive drummer, displayed some 
dazzling brushwork on "Heart House." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Heath, now regularly active as a teacher and clinician, conducted a 
workshop for El Camino earlier in the day. The concert offered proof of the 
eloquence with which he can still practice what he preaches. LEONARD FEATHER

NEW RULES FOR QUINCEANERA STIR COMPLAINT; 
</P>
<P>
CEREMONY: GUIDELINES ALTER TRADITIONAL LATINO CELEBRATION OF A GIRL'S 15TH 
BIRTHDAY, SOME SAY. BUT CHURCH OFFICIALS SAY THE NEW APPROACH WILL STRESS 
SPIRITUALITY AND REDUCE COST TO FAMILIES.

<P>
A set of guidelines dealing with quinceaneras, a 15th birthday tradition for 
young Latinas, has put the Archdiocese of Los Angeles at odds with a group of 
Catholic Latinos who say the rules alter their customs. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials say the guidelines, which were distributed to all churches in 
the Los Angeles Archdiocese last January, are meant to educate priests who 
might not be familiar with the tradition and to provide ways of dealing with a 
shortage of Spanish-speaking clergymen. 
</P>
<P>
But a group of Latinos, who have staged protests at two churches, say many 
parishes have interpreted the suggestions as hard-and-fast rules and in doing 
so are eradicating the quinceanera tradition, which has been likened to the 
coming-out parties of debutantes, but with a simultaneous emphasis on religious 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
"We want some answers," said Spencer Schmerling, one of 30 protesters at a 
rally last Sunday at St. Vibiana Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles. "Why did 
these guidelines come about? Why are our traditions being trampled by the 
church?" 
</P>
<P>
Luis Yanez, organizer of the rally and president of Grupo Latino Por Nuestras 
Tradiciones (Latino Group for Our Traditions), said the protests are an attempt 
to attract Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's attention, who Yanez said has refused 
to meet with members of his group. In a letter sent to Mahony in February, the 
group asked to meet with him and pointed out the guidelines they opposed. One 
of these is that quinceaneras should not be accompanied by the customary 14 
couples (one representing each year of the girl's life), Yanez said. Another 
guideline the group takes issue with suggests that quinceanera Masses should be 
held for a group of girls instead of one girl at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Yanez, who owns a bridal shop in Reseda that makes dresses for quinceaneras, 
acknowledged that he has a business interest in seeing the tradition continue 
unaltered. But he said the guidelines reflect a "lack of understanding" about 
Latino customs on the part of the church. 
</P>
<P>
Father Anastacio Rivera, director of the Hispanic Ministry in Los Angeles 
Archdiocese, met with Yanez and others from his group at Mahony's request. 
Rivera has told members of the group that the guidelines help alleviate a 
shortage of Spanish-speaking priests that has forced many churches to choose 
between performing weddings and baptisms in Spanish or quinceanera Masses.

"There are many churches that have been pushed against the wall because of a 
desperate need for priests who can lead Masses in Spanish," said Rivera, who 
added that Latinos make up nearly 60% of the church's following in the Los 
Angeles Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera added that the suggestions stress the solemnity of the event and play 
down the social aspects of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times people forget the true purpose of the quinceanera tradition, which 
is to reaffirm your faith," he said. "There is alcohol served at the party 
after the Mass, and people spend money that they don't have." 
</P>
<P>
Yanez said that the average family spends about $3,000 on a quinceanera, but he 
said some families have been known to spend up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Father Douglas G. Ferraro, who heads the office of pastoral and parish 
services, which published the guidelines, said he has received complaints about 
the guidelines only from parishioners and, unless nuns or priests complain, the 
guidelines will not be rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
But Father Nicolas Garcia, who is based in the Ventura Mission, said he has 
expressed his discontent with the guidelines several times. 
</P>
<P>
"These guidelines will cause people to turn to Protestant churches who are 
willing to celebrate quinceaneras," warned Garcia, who sent a pamphlet he 
authored on the quinceanera tradition to all 33 churches in the Santa Barbara 
Region of the Los Angeles Archdiocese. "The Archdiocese needs to respect our 
traditions. Listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he has organized a meeting May 2 between a representative of 
Ferraro's office and all of the Latino priests in the Santa Barbara Region to 
discuss the guidelines and what can be done to improve them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bishop Juan Arzube, who heads the archdiocese's San Gabriel pastoral 
region, sent a memorandum to priests there suggesting that no church should ban 
the ceremony. Arzube said he encouraged the ceremony because it provides "a 
teachable moment for the young person, her companions and her family." 
</P>
<P>
"The objection that there are no Spanish-speaking priests in a particular 
parish is not valid, because most of the young people speak English," Arzube 
wrote in the memo, dated March 7. "Furthermore, there are enough priests who 
speak Spanish in the neighboring parishes that one of them could be invited to 
do the ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
Father Domingo Zuniga, of Our Lady Queen of Angels in downtown Los Angeles, 
said sometimes the amount of money spent on the celebration is "a bit 
shocking," but that the church should not interfere in how the families spend 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
Zuniga's church, which is commonly known as La Placita, has not adopted the 
guidelines and up to four traditional quinceanera Masses take place there every 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stress the spirituality of the ceremony, Zuniga's church 
requires quinceaneras who want a Mass at La Placita to have been baptized, have 
completed their first communion and have attended an intensive daylong 
preparatory class offered by the church. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider the quinceanera a family celebration here, and we respect the 
family's traditions," Zuniga said in Spanish.

JEWISH SETTLEMENT IN CHRISTIAN QUARTER OF JERUSALEM BRINGS CALL FOR PROTEST

Eastern Orthodox churches in America are being asked to observe Sunday as a day 
of prayer and protest against the Jewish settlement in the Christian Quarter of 
Jerusalem that was established with help from the Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Iakovos, primate of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and 
South America and chairman of the eight-member Standing Conference of Orthodox 
Bishops in the Americas, announced that the protest will be done in solidarity 
with churches in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Isaiah, chancellor of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South 
America, said the controversy does not represent a Christian-Jewish religious 
quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly has been the first time that there has been deterioration 
between the Greek Orthodox and the Israeli sides politically and religiously," 
the bishop said. He said the Greek Orthodox view the settlement as "an 
expression of an extreme group of people who have received support from the 
Israeli government." 
</P>
<P>
The bishop expressed appreciation for the criticism that Jerusalem Mayor Teddy 
Kollek has made of the settlers and the Israeli government's support for them. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, Teddy Kollek is one of the influential forces that 
understands the situation correctly and interprets it correctly," the bishop 
said.

JEWISH SCHOLARS MARK 7-YEAR STUDY CYCLE 
</P>

Adhering voluntarily to a daily lesson schedule spanning seven years, tens of 
thousands of Orthodox Jews around the world this week completed their study of 
the Talmud, the classic compendium of Judaism's laws and values. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the same men -- businessmen, professionals, rabbis, artists, bakers -- 
will go back today to the start of the Talmud in a regimen they say is 
intellectually and spiritually rewarding. "It's like racquetball; it's good 
exercise," said Dr. Mitch Honig, a North Hollywood dentist. Honig has 
participated in the program 10 years, the first eight in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
But neither he nor dermatologist Martin Kay, who has participated two years, 
planned to end the demanding routine this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the regular, set time for learning," Kay said after a recent class that 
begins weekdays at 6:45 a.m. at North Hollywood's Emek Hebrew Academy. 
</P>
<P>
This week marks the end of the ninth go-round since 1923 when Rabbi Meir 
Shapiro of Lublin, Poland, proposed to an international Jewish meeting that 
Jews everywhere study the identical portion of the Talmud each day. Although 
the program is called Daf Yomi (literally, "a page a day"), students study the 
two facing pages. The cycle takes almost 7 1/2 years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
The standard printed edition used today is the 20-volume "Vilna Shas," which 
follows a format first established last century in Vilnius, Lithuania. Written 
in Aramaic, it requires translation and interpretation by Talmudic scholars. 
</P>
<P>
For those who miss classes because of illness, travel, family or work 
obligations, modern technology eases the demanding pace. Cassette tapes are 
available for missed lessons and in 26 cities there is "Dial-a-Daf" by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Los Angeles participants and their friends celebrated the end of 
the cycle at the Hollywood Palladium on Wednesday night. Thousands more did the 
same at New York's Madison Square Garden Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an astounding moral victory for the Jewish people, who have transplanted 
a style of study and enthusiasm for study that some have thought was buried in 
the ashes of Hitler's Europe," said Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein, professor of 
Judaic studies at Yeshiva University in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Adlerstein said that about 20 classes are now held in Los Angeles and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Talmud, compiled and edited about 1,400 years ago, is second only to the 
Bible in sacred authority for Orthodox Jews. It incorporates Jewish law from 
earlier oral and written traditions but also ranges widely in subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
It is divided into six "orders," or categories, of rabbinic opinion on Jewish 
law: agriculture, the Sabbath and holidays, family relations, property and 
court procedures, Jerusalem Temple regulations and ritual impurity. 
</P>
<P>
The books contain the so-called golden rule of Hillel ("What is hateful to 
yourself, do not do to your fellow man"), sayings such as "Say a little and do 
much" and the proper ways of charity and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
But it also contains much of the intricate legal points of Jewish law that 
non-traditional Jews maintain are religiously irrelevant today -- thus, the 
nearly exclusively Orthodox participation in the Daf Yomi program. 
</P>
<P>
The Talmudic lesson last Monday was on distinguishing menstrual blood stains on 
a woman's garment from blood spots possibly cause by other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish law states that husband and wife must abstain from intimate contact 
during her five-day menstrual period and the following seven days. After she is 
immersed in a ritual bath, the couple can resume sex. But the slightest show of 
blood during the last seven days can be cited as a reason to start the 
seven-day interval over again. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, rabbis in antiquity had to deal with claims that visible blood 
stains might have been caused by lice, bed bugs, wounds or blood splattered in 
a butcher shop. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Avrohom Stulberger of Valley Torah High School, who leads the only Daf 
Yomi class in the San Fernando Valley, said he tries to lighten the lessons 
with a bit of humor in his translations and explanations. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this a zoology course?" he asked rhetorically during the Monday lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain religious precepts do not have an obvious meaning for today," said 
Honig, one of the students, after the lesson. Yet, he and other students said, 
the ways in which rabbis tried to resolve disputes and interpret Jewish law 
fairly still provide lessons in logic and ethics.

Los Angeles Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony has banned a Filipino 
devotional movement from using archdiocesan facilities after a study committee 
said the sectarian group, led by a woman who says God speaks through her, had 
refused to conform to Catholic teachings. 
</P>
<P>
The Banal na Pag-Aaral (BNP) movement -- already banned in Manila by 
CardinalJaime Sin and in San Francisco by Archbishop John Quinn -- is believed 
to have at least 5,000 members within the Filipino Catholic population of 
425,000 in the Los Angeles archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
A study committee headed by Bishop-elect Stephen E. Blaire, moderator of the 
archdiocesan curia, issued a statement that Catholics "should be warned that 
the BNP is not a Roman Catholic organization in any sense of the word," but 
that it had given "the false impression" that it was. 
</P>
<P>
Some priests in the archdiocese had heard confessions and celebrated Masses at 
the movement's intensive weekend retreats, but they now have been ordered to 
disassociate themselves from the BNP. 
</P>
<P>
Blaire said in an interview that the group is led by Salve Carreon, who founded 
the group in the Philippines and later moved to the San Gabriel Valley. 
Attempts to reach a spokesman for reaction from the group were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Blaire said that in re-enactments of the Last Supper during the retreats, 
Carreon has dressed as Christ and blessed bread and wine served to candidates 
for membership. 
</P>
<P>
The study committee said that claims by BNP members to have witnessed 
levitation, the ability to "read hearts" and other supernatural phenomena can 
be attributed to the atmosphere created at the retreats. "Music, lighting, lack 
of sleep and endless hours of lectures create a mixture of expectation and 
terror in the participants," the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
The Filipino Catholic community, second in size among immigrant ethnic groups 
in the archdiocese only to the Mexican Catholic immigrant population, has a 
high proportion of educated, multilingual believers, according to a report last 
year to the Archdiocesan Pastoral Council by Rose Valencia, an official of the 
Filipino Catholic ministry. 
</P>
<P>
But she also cautioned, without singling out BNP or other groups, that many 
Filipino Catholics may remain on the periphery of parish life in this country. 
"If Filipinos are not affirmed in their own unique faith expressions, they tend 
to form home-based churches outside the parishes," Valencia said. "Usually 
these groups are under the influence of very charismatic leaders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LITHUANIA 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Jack M. Tuell of Los Angeles, writing April 6 as president of the United 
Methodist Council of Bishops, commended President Bush for his "sensitive 
restraint" dealing with Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence from 
the Soviet Union. Tuell wrote: "We recognize with you the legitimate desire of 
the Lithuanian people for independence, and are grateful for your support of 
that principle. But we also recognize how dangerous the situation is in the 
Soviet Union, and that adopting confrontational tactics or laying down 
ultimatums could severely damage the emerging possibilities of peace in the 
world." Bush announced Tuesday after consultation with Congress and U.S. allies 
that he would not impose sanctions on the Soviet Union, which has imposed some 
economic blockades on the republic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONVENTION 
</P>
<P>
The National Federation of Priests' Councils, once a feisty challenger to U.S. 
Catholic bishops that preferred to run their dioceses without unsolicited 
advice, will convene next week at Universal City in a much more mellow frame of 
mind. Twenty years ago, the fledgling organization of priests' senates and 
unauthorized associations held their national meeting in San Diego to discuss 
the then-provocative theme of "shared responsibility." The idea of priests' 
advisory councils gradually gained favor in the Roman Catholic Church, however, 
and is now mandated by canon law for every diocese. At last year's convention, 
delegates voted not to pass resolutions in future conventions. The five-day 
convention at the Sheraton Universal opens Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOMINEES 
</P>
<P>
The six-county Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles announced this week that it 
will present seven nominees at a special convention to elect a suffragan, or 
auxiliary bishop, to succeed Bishop Oliver B. Garver Jr., who retires this 
summer. The only local nominee is the Rev. Canon D. Bruce MacPherson, an 
assistant to Bishop Frederick H. Borsch. The election will be held June 9 at 
St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church in Los Angeles.

Actor Walter Matthau will host a musical program at Beverly Hills Presbyterian 
Church at 4 p.m. Sunday that includes "Study for Strings," written by Pavel 
Haas during World War II in Theresienstadt, Adolf Hitler's "model" 
concentration camp for Jewish musicians and composers. Conductor Nick Strimple 
said the piece was first performed as part of a propaganda film featuring the 
camp's string orchestra. Just after the first live performance of the work in 
the summer of 1944, transports took away most of the orchestra members to 
Auschwitz, where only a handful survived. Strimple said the piece has been 
performed five other times but never in the United States. JOHN DART

SAME EAST GERMAN TALENT, NEW APPROACH; 
</P>
<P>
GYMNASTICS: POLITICAL CHANGES HAVE OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE TEAM'S FIRST VISIT 
TO THE UNITED STATES IN 11 YEARS. 
</P>

MEMPHIS, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When East German gymnasts were told they were going to the United States, they 
said they envisioned skyscrapers. Instead, they got the suburbs of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the fact that the East German gymnasts are here for the first 
time in 11 years, for a dual meet against the United States, signifies the 
political changes taking place in their country. 
</P>
<P>
This meet -- the women compete today and the men Sunday -- may be among the 
last times East Germany will compete internationally under its own flag. By 
1992 East and West Germany are expected to reunify and compete as one. 
</P>
<P>
Probably more significant of the changes, however, is who's not here. 
</P>
<P>
Andreas Wecker, one of East Germany's top male gymnasts, stayed home partly 
because of an injury. That injury, though, is not keeping him from commuting to 
West Germany to help train athletes. The West Germans may even hire Wecker, 
even though he would still compete for East Germany until reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"Seen from yesterday's point of view, this would not be OK," Klaus Heller, the 
general secretary of the German Democratic Republic Gymnastics Federation said 
Thursday at the Mid-South Coliseum, where the meet will be held. "But this same 
thing, seen from tomorrow's view, yes." 
</P>
<P>
For years, U.S. Gymnastics Federation officials have asked the East Germans to 
come to the United States, but the requests were denied. The GDR had not sent a 
gymnastics team to the United States since 1979, for the World Championships at 
Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a good rapport and always felt a warmth from the East Germans, but 
often we could not get into their country and, certainly, they never came 
here," said Robert Cowan, a USGF official. "But after the Wall fell (in 
November), it was easy." 
</P>
<P>
So here they are, in the city of the king -- Elvis -- of whom even these 
gymnasts say they have heard. But Graceland will have to wait until Monday. The 
East Germans are working out here twice a day, once with the Americans, once in 
a private gym. And this competition is merely an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. gymnasts conducted interviews between workouts Thursday, but East German 
officials said their gymnasts could not talk until the workout was over. Then, 
as soon as they finished, they were hurried out the door and into a waiting 
van. Officials said their gymnasts were through talking for the day. But they 
had never talked at all. And this happened on media day. 
</P>
<P>
But Heller says these training methods set the East Germans apart and will be 
of help to the West Germans, who did not qualify in gymnastics for the 1988 
Olympics. East and West German gymnasts will begin working out together in May 
in East Berlin and in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Our gymnasts practice about five hours a day, the same as West Germany, but 
our method and intensity is different," said Heller, speaking through an 
interpreter. "It is the same quantity, but the quality is different." 
</P>
<P>
East German gymnasts don't appear to be worried about the increased 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"West Germany can't catch up with us," said Baerbel Wielgoss, one of East 
Germany's top female gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, U.S. women gymnasts also practice about five hours a day. They 
finished fourth at the 1989 World Championships, one place ahead of the East 
Germans. And at the 1988 Olympics, a technical error by the United States gave 
East Germany the bronze medal. That technical violation was called on the 
United States by an East German judge. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. men, because of college demands, train about three hours a day. In 
comparison, Cowan, who recently returned from East Germany, said the men there 
train twice a day, about three to four hours each time, and attend school in 
between training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1989 World Championships, East Germany finished second to the Soviets. 
The United States tied for eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"Our men can't train that many hours," Cowan said. "In East Germany, the focus 
of their athletes is gymnastics, and their lives are built around that. In the 
United States, the men's focus is college, or school, and gymnastics is built 
around that. Their kids don't work any harder than ours, they just work longer, 
more hours." 
</P>
<P>
East Germany also draws from a much larger pool of elite gymnasts. Its program 
has about 1,000 male and female elites, with 400,000 gymnasts overall, and 250 
coaches. The United States has about 100 male and 100 female elites. 
</P>
<P>
The methods employed by the East German sports system, the so-called miracle 
machine, are often criticized by Western countries. Its talent development 
program identifies young athletes and assigns them to government-run sports 
clubs for training. That helps explain how a country with a population of fewer 
than 17 million could become a medal factory. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1968, only the Soviet Union and the United States have won more medals. 
And in the medal count for both the 1988 Winter and Summer Olympics, East 
Germany was second to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Heller, secretary of the gymnastics federation for six years, said he would 
like to dispel the idea that athletes must compete against their will, and that 
children are taken from their homes against their parents' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
He admits that talented young gymnasts are identified and moved to 
government-operated sports clubs, usually at age 10, but he says they have a 
choice. He says that only half the athletes live away from home. The others 
stay with their parents because they have clubs in their cities. 
</P>
<P>
Wielgoss, 17, says there is a club in her hometown of Rostock, so she has 
always lived at home with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Heller says, elite gymnasts or their families do not benefit from 
material or economic gain -- unless they win. Then they can receive about 
$20,000 per gold medal. Furthermore, Heller says gymnasts can even quit -- and 
always could -- with no ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Heller said Doerte Thuemmler, one of their top women, quit last 
year at 17, before the new government took over. And Anke Wilkenloh, 18, 
another star, quit four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"(Anke) told me, 'I quit, I am finished,' " Heller said. "I told her the 
advantages of staying, that she would get a three-week vacation in the United 
States with her parents after the Goodwill Games. Still, she said no." 
</P>
<P>
What lies ahead for East German sports is uncertain. Seemingly, the new 
government doesn't care as much about developing athletes. The centralized 
system of long-term planning, which has been so effective, is now being 
criticized by supporters of the new government. 
</P>
<P>
Then-East German prime minister Hans Modrow said in a speech in December that 
the country will place as much emphasis on recreational sports for all citizens 
as it does on developing elite athletes for international competition. That 
means less money for the sports federations. 
</P>
<P>
Heller thinks that the number of elite athletes may stay the same, but the 
number of coaches may be cut in half. So, while the changes are met by East 
German officials with joy and expectation on one hand, there are economic 
concerns on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The positive changes, Heller said, are certain to be a better opportunity for 
travel and perhaps even better nutrition for the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"For now, things are the same," Heller said. "But there will be a new situation 
in July." 
</P>
<P>
At that time, West Germany's Deutsch mark will also become East Germany's 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
Added Heller: "(Up) to now, there was no unemployment in the GDR, not only in 
sports, but in any industry. That is not so well known by others. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see. We wait."

HERSHISER FACES LONG ROAD BACK TO MOUND; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE IS FINISHED FOR SEASON AND HIS FUTURE IS CLOUDED. JOBE SAYS 
SHOULDER INJURY CAME FROM PITCHING TOO MANY INNINGS.

Orel Hershiser's 1990 season ended and his baseball future was placed in doubt 
Friday when doctors, finding major damage, reconstructed the major ligament 
structure in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"We found more damage than was evident on the MRI exam," said Dr. Frank Jobe, 
referring to the Magnetic Resonancy Image examination, which revealed 
Hershiser's problem Thursday. "The decision was mandatory to reconstruct." 
</P>
<P>
In a 3 1/2-hour procedure at Inglewood's Centinela Hospital Medical Center, 
three surgeons reconstructed a torn anterior labrum and anterior capsule, a 
structure that keeps the shoulder stable. 
</P>
<P>
Jobe said some parts of the shoulder were in such bad shape, "It was as if 
somebody had pounded them with a hammer." 
</P>
<P>
The procedure has never been performed on a major league pitcher, and Hershiser 
has been ordered not to throw a ball for four months, nor pitch competitively 
until next season. Jobe said it will take even longer for Hershiser to regain 
the form that enabled him to win the Cy Young Award in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"A year is required before he can return to a game," Jobe said. "But it will 
take longer than that for the shoulder to reach its maximum ability." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, whose career record is 99-65 with a 2.71 earned-run average, had not 
missed a start in his seven-year career, a span of 195 starts. He has led the 
National League in innings pitched each of the last three seasons, pitching 788 
1/3 regular-season innings over that time. 
</P>
<P>
But Jobe said the stress of those innings resulted in his problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching a lot was his problem," Jobe said. "After a while, there is a limit 
to what people can tolerate. It may have been better not to pitch so much. But 
sometimes, I guess, the team needed him to do things (the shoulder) really 
didn't want him to do." 
</P>
<P>
With those innings, an uncomplaining Hershiser has helped the Dodgers to two 
West Division titles and a World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it shows how well we take care of our pitchers that he lasted as long 
as he did," trainer Bill Buhler said. "I don't see how we can be any more 
conservative than we were." 
</P>
<P>
Said Manager Tom Lasorda: "It's like watching a tire and trying to guess when 
it's going to blow. If Orel or anybody ever told me their arm was hurting, I 
would take them out of the game immediately. If anybody says a lot of innings 
can hurt somebody, I would ask them to look at Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"Each person is different and, unless somebody tells me they are hurting, it is 
impossible for me to guess." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mike Morgan added: "They do more stuff to help pitchers here than any 
place I've been. I think it goes to show, when your arm is ready to go, it 
goes, no matter what. I want to pitch until I drop, and I know a lot of guys 
feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
Jobe said the factors exist for Hershiser eventually to pitch normally. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Orel will get his full range of motion back and his strength back and 
his rhythm back," Jobe said. "So the principals are all good. We think he can 
pitch again. . . . We just don't have any precedent to base it on." 
</P>
<P>
Jobe said the operation has been performed on minor league pitchers, none of 
whom have made the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure, which Jobe said will leave Hershiser with a 4 1/2-inch scar near 
his armpit, involves using new, smaller instruments to bypass the muscle and 
operate directly on the ligaments. Jobe said Hershiser had to accept the 
procedure, because to operate on the muscle would have ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the question is, why do this new procedure on a major league pitcher 
if it's never been done before?" Jobe said. "Well, the alternative was to do an 
operation we have done for 50 years that had a 100% failure rate. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't promise success here, but we really think we got it all. We really 
think this gave us a good chance." 
</P>
<P>
Jobe said Fernando Valenzuela may have required the same surgery during his 
shoulder problems of 1988, but said Valenzuela refused even to undergo an MRI 
exam to determine the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"He chose to go the rehabilitation route, which is fine and seems to have 
worked out OK," Jobe said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Dodger is wondering if Hershiser has second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are a lot of things Orel is thinking about, maybe about some of 
the times he stayed in a game," said Tim Belcher, who referred to his own 
performance of Thursday, during which he allowed St. Louis six runs in 6 1/3 
innings that included a three-run homer by Pedro Guerrero after walking two 
batters in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm thinking about it from Thursday night," Belcher said. "I walk two 
batters in the seventh inning and red flags are going up all over the stadium. 
But no way am I going to put up that white flag myself. When we get 
competitive, we get stupid. No way would I ask to come out of that game. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, maybe I should have told Perry (pitching coach Ron Perranoski), 
'I've got to get out of here.' But it's so hard to say that. I think restraint 
has to exercised by somebody independent of the athlete himself."

RAIDERS HIRE MIKE WHITE, FORMER ILLINI AND CAL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The revamping of the Raider offense, which began abortively with the hiring and 
firing of Mike Shanahan, continued Friday with the team's announcement that it 
has hired the Bill Walsh-trained Mike White to be an assistant coach in charge 
of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
The projects are expected to be the Raider quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
As a coach at California and Illinois, White developed Joe Roth, Dave Wilson, 
Jack Trudeau and Tony Eason. Just before leaving Illinois in the wake of an 
NCAA investigation that eventually land the program on probation, White landed 
Jeff George, who was transferring from Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
White twice won coach-of-the-year mentions: the first time at Cal in 1975, when 
his Bears were Pacific 8 co-champions; and in 1983 at Illinois, when his Illini 
went to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Between his Cal and Illinois stints, he was a 49er assistant. He stayed close 
to Walsh and was often rumored as a replacement, should Walsh have chosen to 
move to general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh is a one-time Raider assistant with close ties to Al Davis. When Davis' 
experiment of updating his offense by hiring an outsider -- Shanahan -- 
backfired, Davis turned to Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh had set up a camp to teach offensive football in San Jose. The Raiders, 
the first team to attend, sent Coach Art Shell, quarterbacks Steve Beuerlein 
and Jay Schroeder and a couple of assistants. 
</P>
<P>
However, they got only 1 1/2 days in before Walsh got a call from his employer, 
NBC, which felt the camp was a conflict of interest. Walsh stopped in 
mid-session and the Raiders went home. 
</P>
<P>
Now they have their own chip off the block.

DEA OPERATIVE DETAILS HIS ROLE IN KIDNAPING; 
</P>
<P>
CAMARENA CASE: HE SAYS HE ARRANGED THE ABDUCTION OF MEXICAN DOCTOR WITH U.S. 
AGENT'S APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, This story was reported by Times staff writers Marjorie 
Miller in Mexico City, Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington and Paul Lieberman and 
Henry Weinstein in Los Angeles. It was written by Weinstein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A longtime Drug Enforcement Administration operative says the plot to kidnap a 
Mexican physician accused of participating in the murder of U.S. drug agent 
Enrique Camarena was hatched in his fortified Los Angeles apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Garate Bustamante, a 51-year-old former Mexican police officer, said in 
an interview that he arranged the controversial April 2 abduction with the 
approval of a DEA agent in Los Angeles. He said that for the last several years 
he has assisted the DEA in tracking down suspects believed to have been 
involved in the February, 1985, kidnaping and murder of Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials confirmed that Garate was the key go-between in arranging the 
abduction, calling him a longtime agency "asset," a term frequently used to 
describe an informant and operative. They also confirmed key portions of his 
account of the abduction. And, Friday night, Mexico's attorney general said he 
would issue an arrest warrant for Garate as the ringleader of the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy interview this week in the apartment that serves as his 
headquarters -- with two telephones constantly ringing and automatic weapons at 
the ready -- Garate said the clandestine venture was carried out by 10 
Mexicans, including federal policemen, who were promised a total of $100,000 to 
stalk and capture Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain and then fly him to El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
"They call us bounty hunters," Garate said, "but it was the challenge, you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The daring abduction in Guadalajara, Mexico, which sparked a controversy 
between the United States and Mexico, was dubbed "The Wild Geese," named for a 
1978 commando movie starring Richard Burton. 
</P>
<P>
Garate said his plans to abduct Alvarez were approved by Hector Berellez, a DEA 
agent in Los Angeles who heads Operation Leyenda, a nine-member unit 
investigating Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do anything without their knowledge," Garate declared. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Berellez nor other members of the unit would comment on Garate's 
account of the kidnaping. But one DEA official said Friday night that Berellez 
was not aware of the specifics of the kidnaping until it occurred. Berellez was 
one of the three DEA agents who arrested Alvarez in El Paso after the doctor 
was delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials up to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari have assailed the 
operation as an insult to their country's sovereignty and threatened to 
discontinue cooperation in efforts to curb drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
They maintain that the doctor's kidnaping was a "rogue operation" mounted by 
DEA agents in Los Angeles, and have demanded to know whether Washington 
officials approved the mission. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh has ordered an internal investigation of the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
Acting DEA Director Terrence Burke would not confirm or deny whether top agency 
officials knew about the planned kidnaping. However, he dismissed Mexico's 
allegation of a rogue operation. "I'm saying nobody works independently, no 
single agent works on his own." 
</P>
<P>
In the first inside account of the kidnaping, Garate said the operation was 
undertaken after two failed attempts between the United States and Mexico to 
swap suspects, including Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I called some friends -- Mexican federales -- and we did the 
operation," Garate said. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials, including recently retired Director John C. Lawn, have long 
wanted Alvarez, a 300-pound gynecologist, who allegedly administered drugs to 
revive Camarena so he could be interrogated and tortured further by drug 
traffickers and some ranking Mexican law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was abducted off the streets of Guadalajara and his mutilated body was 
found several weeks later, triggering a massive manhunt for the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Packing a hefty handgun on his right hip, Garate said Mexican officials brought 
the kidnaping on themselves by failing to punish all who participated in the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the dirty guys," Garate said. "We did it because we had a reason and 
they started it." 
</P>
<P>
In part, the DEA has had to rely on shadowy figures, like Garate, who are 
familiar with the labyrinthian world of Mexican drug traffickers, law 
enforcement and politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the crooks. I know Guadalajara," said Garate, who once headed the 
Guadalajara State Police SWAT team. Garate said he is paid $4,000 a month for 
his DEA work, sometimes by check and sometimes in cash. He wore a blue work 
shirt, black jeans, white tennis shoes, a gold chain and a gold and diamond 
bracelet during the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Several DEA sources said Garate in the past had ties to drug traffickers, and 
Garate acknowledged breaking the law while working as a Mexican police 
official. "I know people on both sides," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garate said he has been working on the Camarena case in the United States since 
1986, when he had to leave Mexico because he said drug traffickers put a 
$500,000 bounty on his head. Mexican officials said Friday night that Garate 
had been sought on unspecified criminal charges since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the DEA attempted to get ranking Mexican officials to deliver Alvarez 
in exchange for two Mexican nationals who are wanted for stealing millions from 
banks and are believed to be hiding in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ranking DEA officials, including Berellez and Bill Waters, who heads the 
agency's Office of Professional Responsibility in Washington, met with Pablo 
Aleman Diaz, head of the non-narcotics section of the Mexican Federal Judicial 
Police, and a commander with the judicial police. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans offered to find the two accused Mexican swindlers, one believed 
to be in San Diego and the other in New Mexico, and have them deported as 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
The swap plan collapsed in late January, Garate said, when the Mexicans failed 
to deliver Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Garate said, he got on the phone with friends in Mexico -- "a 
few honest cops." 
</P>
<P>
Garate said some of the men were motivated by loyalty to him and others simply 
by the challenge. "They're fighters. They're The Wild Geese." 
</P>
<P>
Garate said the men conducted a lengthy surveillance of Alvarez in Guadalajara 
before he was snatched from his office on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers drove Alvarez to Silao, a small town north of Guadalajara, and 
the next, flew him from the nearby town of Leon in a small plane to El Paso. 
There, he was arrested by Berellez and two other DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
"When Alvarez got off the plane he talked and talked, compulsively," Garate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's lawyer, Robert K. Steinberg, told a federal judge in Los Angeles last 
week that his client was abducted by a group of men who identified themselves 
as Mexican police. Steinberg said the abductors informed the doctor that he was 
being arrested for performing an illegal abortion, which he denied. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg also said that Alvarez told him one of the men on the plane had 
identified himself as a DEA agent. If Alvarez was brought to the United States 
illegally, Steinberg said, "then that kidnaping is almost as bad as what my 
client is accused of." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Steinberg for the first time said his client was 
"beaten up" and prodded seven times with an electric stun gun while he was 
being flown to El Paso. "A stun gun does not leave a mark," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
But Garate maintained that no physical harm was done to Alvarez. "We 
photographed him all over, in the nude, to show that he wasn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie said at last week's hearing that the manner 
of Alvarez's apprehension was of "considerable concern" to him. He ordered DEA 
officials to appear at a May 25 hearing on the matter, and severed Alvarez from 
next week's scheduled trial of four other men accused of involvement in the 
Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Garate said his crew incurred considerable travel and hotel expenses while 
carrying out the operation, including $30,000 to rent the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The men were not paid up front for their work, Garate explained. "They know me. 
They trust me. . . . They did it for friendship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garate said the kidnapers have still not been paid. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to, I'll sell my house in Arizona to pay them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Mexico's attorney general announced that two active duty 
policemen, a former federal police officer, and three others had been arrested 
and charged with kidnaping Alvarez. He said arrest warrants would be issued for 
seven other individuals, including Garate. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-page report issued by the attorney general said the pilot who flew Alvarez 
to the United States told Mexican law enforcement officers that Alvarez's 
kidnapers said they were engaged in a joint operation of the DEA and Interpol, 
the international police agency. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said Alvarez had been an ally of Mexican drug kingpin 
Rafael Caro Quintero, now imprisoned in Mexico for his role in Camarena's 
killing. However, his report added, "nothing or no one can justify" the illicit 
manner in which Alvarez was kidnaped and taken to a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not specifically condemn the DEA. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Garate vowed he would never disclose who perpetrated the 
abduction. "I won't stab my friends in the back," Garate said, because it would 
endanger their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Garate said he thought his role with the DEA could be endangered by talking. 
But he said he is angry about the DEA getting a bad rap for the kidnaping and 
that he was not concerned about diplomatic niceties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a cop, not a politician," he proclaimed. He also stated emphatically that 
no DEA agent set foot in Mexico to assist the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the DEA agents working on the Camarena case were heavy-handed, he 
responded: "In this kind of business you have to be tough. That doesn't mean 
you have to be trigger-happy. You have to be stubborn and dedicated. We've been 
on this since it happened. We're not going to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Garate's apartment displays striking evidence of his hazardous line of work. 
</P>
<P>
Propped against one side of his bed is an M-16 assault rifle. On the other is 
an AK-47. Still another semiautomatic rifle was spread out in parts on the bed. 
"This is the price I pay for the work I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Further evidence of Garate's close ties to the Camarena investigation and the 
Alvarez kidnaping were provided by a large piece of art in his three-room 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
On the bedroom wall, there is a charcoal drawing of a commando unit and a 
helicopter. The drawing bears the DEA logo in the center and is entitled "The 
Wild Geese." It was drawn for Garate by DEA agent Abel Reynoso, a member of the 
unit investigating Camarena's death, and signed by him: "Por mi commandante Don 
Antonio Garate, 3-19-90."

U.S. AID FUNDS FOR AFGHAN REBUILDING SEEN AS WASTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Millions of dollars in U.S. aid money earmarked for the reconstruction of 
Afghanistan have been squandered through mismanagement, inefficiency and 
political miscalculations by the U.N. office in charge of the project, 
according to independent relief agencies, Afghan professionals, U.N. workers 
and Western diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
The program was begun in October, 1988, as an ambitious, billion-dollar 
international effort to rebuild Afghanistan after a decade of war. Tens of 
millions of dollars have been spent on salaries, offices, vehicles and housing 
since then -- but only a handful of roads, canals and villages have been 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
Poor accounting or no accounting has led to double-funding of projects, some of 
which are still unstarted. In numerous cases, money or material aid has simply 
been used for the wrong purpose. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, for example, funds earmarked for rebuilding a road between 
villages were spent instead on an illegal logging road that has further ravaged 
a rural area. In another, scores of oxen purchased under a U.N. project so that 
farmers in some areas could plow their fields again were eaten by returning 
refugees who had been given nothing to care for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial and costly of all the projects funded by the office of 
the U.N. coordinator, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, is a multimillion-dollar 
effort, financed largely by the United States, to help clear Afghanistan of 
millions of land mines. These continue to kill or maim people returning from 
refugee camps in Pakistan to areas of Afghanistan where fighting in the civil 
war has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad cited the mine-clearance program last month in a 
report to Washington that harshly criticized the Sadruddin operation. It said 
it has "produced very little in the way of substantive impact on the 
humanitarian side." 
</P>
<P>
A Western aid official said, "There's really nothing they've done well, and the 
mine program is typical of their failures." 
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official who worked on the mine-clearing project called it "as 
scandalous as the mine fields themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has spent nearly $3 million instructing 7,494 Afghans in 
mine-clearing procedure at a Pakistani army facility, but now, a year later, 
most of these people have disappeared. Most of the remaining trainees are still 
considered unqualified, and fewer than 50 have gone into Afghanistan to begin 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a very expensive mistake," said Rae McGrath, who resigned in 
frustration last month as a key official in the mine-clearance program. "Rather 
than try to train 15,000 de-miners at a low level of competence, it would have 
been better to train 1,500 at a very high level. 
</P>
<P>
"But the whole thing was poorly planned. They were training people, but they 
weren't giving any thought to actually putting them inside Afghanistan. They 
just jumped in overnight and went too fast in the wrong directions." 
</P>
<P>
Western aid officials, who asked not to be identified by name, blame the 
impatience for quick, high-profile results on what they described as Prince 
Sadruddin's ambition to become secretary general of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
The prince's office in Islamabad denies this. Sadruddin, a wealthy Ismailian 
Muslim based in Switzerland, was U.N. high commissioner for refugees for more 
than a decade and was personally endorsed by President Bush, a close friend, to 
head the Afghan program. 
</P>
<P>
Shakil Khan, a retired Pakistani army major who was appointed by Sadruddin's 
office to head the mine-clearance program, conceded that costly mistakes have 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important and well-founded criticism," Khan said of the charge 
that training funds were wasted. "But this is the first time the U.N. has taken 
up this kind of program. Now we have learned from mistakes, and we think the 
whole operation will improve this year." 
</P>
<P>
Two U.N. mine-clearance teams of 27 men each are scheduled to begin work in 
Afghanistan after Tuesday, and the United Nations is negotiating to buy 
equipment that can clear large numbers of mines in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some critics insist that large-scale waste will continue in the 
reconstruction project because of the way it is structured, with all the major 
U.N. agencies working in Afghanistan under the control of Sadruddin's office, 
which is thousands of miles away in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, in their report last month, said: "There is not a single (U.N.) 
agency head in Islamabad who thinks the management approach is working, nor is 
there any embassy in Islamabad that will speak favorably of it. And worse, 
there seems to be little or no prospect for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, who have run a largely successful cross-border aid project in 
Afghanistan for the past five years, have paid close attention to the 
mine-clearing program because it is financed almost entirely by the U.S. 
taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
They were upset when Sadruddin refused last month to use part of the 
mine-clearance money to fund an American project that was already under way in 
Afghanistan, using trained personnel and dogs that can sniff out mines. 
</P>
<P>
Sadruddin said in a letter to the U.S. ambassador in Pakistan that the American 
project violated the dogs' animal rights. He said mines placed by human beings 
should be removed by human beings. 
</P>
<P>
The message, circulated throughout the aid community, provoked a furious 
response from international aid workers, who questioned the prince's concern 
for the lives of the Afghan people being trained in mine clearance. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-million program, which is funded separately by the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, has problems of its own. The dogs are from Thailand 
and apparently understand only Thai commands. Thai military instructors and 
interpreters had to be brought in for two months last summer to train the 
American dog handlers, who then had to train Afghans through other 
interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Thai dogs are the descendants of dogs that the U.S. Army took 
to Bangkok in the early 1970s, and Thai dog handlers were trained by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Aid officials explain that the U.S. Army discontinued its dog program after the 
Vietnam War and that the Thai dogs were the only trained animals available. 
U.S. officials are negotiating to buy 40 additional Thai dogs for use in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there are some problems," one aid worker conceded, "but the dog story is 
really what the whole issue is about. Basically, it's a success story, and 
basically Sadruddin doesn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Experts involved in the U.N. project agree. They are quietly disregarding the 
prince's ban on using dogs, and not long ago, they committed $450,000 in U.N. 
money for the purchase of vehicles to carry dogs into Afghanistan to work with 
the U.N. teams there. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of the Sadruddin operation is not limited to the high-profile 
mine-clearance project. Abdullah Ali, an Afghan technocrat who joined a 
U.N.-financed reconstruction agency in November, said the ultimate irony is the 
title of the program's director. 
</P>
<P>
He said Sadruddin's official title is "Coordinator for the United Nations in 
Afghanistan," but if the program lacks anything, it is coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"That's its biggest problem," he said. "Right now, everyone is working 
unsystematically." 
</P>
<P>
Ali cited the United Nations' approval last year of an Afghan resistance 
commander's request for $1 million, which he said would be used to clear a road 
that he said serves 30 villages in Afghanistan's Kunar province. 
</P>
<P>
"In reality," Ali said, "never in history were there even 30 people who lived 
anywhere near that road. "What the commander did was reopen a road that led to 
one of the few forests left near the Pakistan border. He cut down all the trees 
and made a personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that no one is checking on anything, and the U.N. seems to be 
in a big hurry to spend all the money." 
</P>
<P>
At Sadruddin's office in Islamabad, public relations director Rene Albreck 
conceded that there has been a lack of accountability in the program. He blamed 
it on the fact that such checking is impossible in a country still at war. 
</P>
<P>
Albreck pointed to Sadruddin's latest official position paper, entitled "Plan 
of Action, 1990," and said: "The key word now is systematic. There was no 
systematic follow-up on anything in the past, and we would like to have more 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
"But much of the larger problem was based on a wrong assumption. We assumed 
that a million refugees would go home when the Soviets left Afghanistan last 
year, and the point is, nothing happened. Nobody went back. So we've been 
rethinking everything. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be different types of mistakes, and in our case you can say the 
mistake was the miscalculation and being too optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
International aid officials, who represent scores of countries that in 1988 
pledged a total of $195 million for the Afghan reconstruction effort, insist 
that they have been extremely costly mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe things will improve this year. Who knows?" a European aid official said. 
"But when you look at programs like the mines, it's not just the money. One 
wonders just how many limbs and how many lives might have been saved -- and 
might yet be saved -- if only the prince could get his act together."

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the stroke of 6 p.m. on Sunday, British Satellite Broadcasting will launch a 
$2.1-billion television programming service that will give Britain five new 
national channels, advance the state of TV technology by a couple of notches 
and threaten competitor Rupert Murdoch's dream of a satellite television 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
Premiere night viewers will first see a program about the company's operations 
called "Around BSB in 80 Minutes." Then its five themed channels -- all 
transmitted from the company's own satellite -- will split off in separate 
directions. Subscribers will have their choice of the Movie Channel, which will 
debut with the James Bond film "The Living Daylights;" the Sports Channel; 
Galaxy, a general entertainment channel; Now -- The Channel for Living, which 
will provide information and arts programming, and Power Station, BSB's answer 
to MTV. 
</P>
<P>
The grandiose debut is marred only by the fact that fewer than 500 households 
in Britain have the special reception kits needed to pick up BSB's satellite 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
Even when coupled with the estimated 300,000 homes capable of receiving BSB 
through cable television, the viewership remains at an extremely modest level 
that makes the launch mostly symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that no one is interested. More than 40,000 people paid a $16.50 
deposit to join a "Launch Club" that would supposedly give them first crack at 
BSB receiving equipment. They're still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that manufacturing setbacks have created such a severe shortage 
of reception kits that there do not appear to be enough even to supply 
demonstration models for all the country's retail showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got one," quips John Gau, the company's optimistic chief programmer. But 
he admits, "We certainly have a slight temporary glitch. We'll have a month of 
glitches." 
</P>
<P>
He believes that the equipment will become widely available by late May or 
June. From that point, according to the company's internal financial forecasts, 
BSB will have to pick up 3 million subscribers in three years to break even. 
That means one of every seven of Britain's 21 million television households. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, that's quite a tough call but not impossible," says Gau, a veteran 
of the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
A consortium of investors led by Granada TV, entertainment and media giant 
Pearson, Reed International, the French communications group Chargeurs and Bond 
Corp. of Australia are betting heavily that it will work, but the obstacles are 
formidable. 
</P>
<P>
Most noticeably blocking the path to riches for BSB is Murdoch's rival Sky 
Television, which already beams four channels -- news, sports, general 
entertainment and a subscription movie service -- across the country. Besides 
persuading consumers that they should invest in satellite TV in general, BSB 
must persuade them to choose its channels over Murdoch's. 
</P>
<P>
That won't be easy. Sky, operating for more than a year, claims to reach 
720,000 dishes in the UK and Ireland. "We feel we have an important lead over 
them," says Fiona Waters, director of publicity for Sky. 
</P>
<P>
The big lead is significant not only for the early momentum it has given Sky 
but because of the incompatibility of the rival satellite transmissions. Each 
system has its own receiving dish that cannot pick up the other's signals. With 
a minimum outlay of several hundred dollars required to buy the cheapest dish, 
overlapping is expected to be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
The BSB equipment, which transmits on a technologically advanced D-Mac 
standard, will provide better quality pictures and is likely to offer 
additional features down the road because of its high power and ability to 
address individual receivers. 
</P>
<P>
And BSB also is quick to point out that its range of dishes -- the most 
publicized being a flat, square device nicknamed the "Squarial" -- are smaller 
and less obtrusive than the Sky dish. Reports of neighborhood squabbles over 
the alleged unsightliness of the Sky dish are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
But Sky, which transmits on the European standard PAL, has its equipment priced 
at least $150 less than BSB's -- just over $400 for a unit with remote control, 
compared to an average $575 for BSB. It remains to be seen how many people will 
pay extra for a marginally sharper picture. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the satellite battle of Britain will probably be decided by 
programming. If there's something viewers want to watch, they'll get it. 
</P>
<P>
BSB seems confident that it has the overall formula and the individual hit 
shows. The company has gone to tremendous lengths to push the notion that it 
alone will be the British satellite system, a sort of BBC from outer space. At 
the same time, BSB has tried to portray Sky as an Australian-American invader 
that befouls the airwaves with mindless game shows, professional wrestling and 
car chase movies. 
</P>
<P>
While Sky's entertainment programming does contain a healthy share of cheap 
American reruns and has been soundly criticized by the press, its Sky News has 
received high marks. In addition to offering its news channel and Sky One, the 
general entertainment channel, Murdoch's enterprise also includes Eurosport, 
which is beamed across Europe, and Sky Movies, a pay subscription service. 
</P>
<P>
For its programming, BSB also has included some American retreads but appears 
to be reaching for a certain level of sophistication. Among the U.S. shows set 
to air are "Hill Street Blues," "St. Elsewhere" and "China Beach" -- along with 
"The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
But much of the programming will be new shows commissioned from British 
production companies or reruns of British hits. 
</P>
<P>
"They've bought a lot of the classic BBC shows," says Graham Wilde, an 
executive at CIT Research in London, which studies the telecommunications 
industry. "I think that's significant. People prefer to watch programs that are 
based in their own countries." 
</P>
<P>
The most intense fighting between BSB and Sky is expected to come over their 
movie channels. Sky Movies and BSB's Movie Channel, which both charge about $15 
monthly, will bring each company about 70% of its revenue for now, according to 
CIT. Advertising income is expected to be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
With Hollywood at the core of both movie channels, Sky has struck exclusive 
British pay-TV deals with 20th Century Fox, which Murdoch owns, and Disney's 
Touchstone. BSB has exclusive rights to 2,500 films from Paramount, Universal, 
Columbia, MGM/UA, Orion and Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've both put together attractive movie packages," says CIT's 
Wilde. With BSB finally debuting, the satellite contest may ultimately rest on 
which company is willing -- or able -- to lose the most money for the longest 
time. Sky officials said they are losing a whopping $3.3 million a week, but 
Murdoch has stated publicly he will stay in the game for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
BSB's backers also are investing the kind of money that would suggest that they 
will wait out rough times. BSB will spend $363 million on programming during 
its first year of operation. Another $330 million will be spent over the next 
three years on marketing and promotion aimed at grabbing those viewers who may 
sign up eventually but need "an extra push" to do it right away. 
</P>
<P>
While no one can predict whether one or both satellite services will survive, 
one scenario is that both companies will find it too difficult to continue 
after spending such vast amounts of money, says CIT's Wilde. "It's difficult to 
see how they're ever going to recoup that money," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Mayhew, a media analyst with Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton in London, 
envisions another possible outcome that would hinge on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
Although the British cable industry is in its infancy, it could see explosive 
growth over the next few years. If that happens, Mayhew says, "there is room 
for two significant program suppliers." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sky and BSB will battle for the great rewards that could result from 
their gamble. Says BSB spokeswoman Alison Jackson, describing the lure of such 
a risky venture: "Once you get rich in this business, you get very rich, and 
you stay rich for a long time."

MEXICO TO PRIVATIZE 30 FIRMS, OFFER THEM ON STOCK MARKET 
</P>

<P>
Mexico will sell up to 30 state-owned companies to the public on the Mexican 
Stock Exchange, according to a highly placed government official. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the companies involved is expected within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the companies public would accomplish two goals of the Mexican 
Administration: continued reduction of the state's role in the economy and 
strengthening of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of 30 new issues would increase the exchange's actively traded 
stocks by half, helping to cool a market that some investors and regulators 
worry has grown too hot in the early months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Market regulators have said previously that they would like to see the stock 
exchange participate in divestitures of state-owned companies that are large 
enough and financially strong enough to be appropriate candidates for public 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
However, they said they would be reluctant to offer the investing public shares 
in troubled companies. 
</P>
<P>
The form the offerings will take has not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous forms have been utilized in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the government sold on the exchange 34% of the stock in seven of 
the strongest state-owned banks. Those sales were actually voteless shares 
called investment participation certificates, or CAPs, the initials of their 
Spanish name. 
</P>
<P>
Mexicana Airlines was first sold to a group of investors, who then made a 
public offering, selling part of their interest in the company in order to 
raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
Another state-owned company, Telefonos de Mexico, is already publicly traded, 
although the government owns controlling interest. Market regulators and 
brokers say they expect to play an active role in the sale of the government's 
interest in the telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, state-owned companies -- notably Petroleos Mexicanos, the oil 
monopoly -- are active in the bond and commercial paper markets.

FACES . . . : DOWN-TO-EARTH ALIEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"It ain't glamorous," actress Terri Treas says of the realities of her role on 
Fox's "Alien Nation." Treas plays Cathy Frankel -- one of a shipful of bald, 
speckle-headed "Newcomers" who land on Earth and must adapt to human culture. 
</P>
<P>
Treas, in turn, must adapt to her most unusual acting assignment. On-the-set 
nicknames such as "Sponge Head," impossible-to-reach itches under all that 
latex and a constant battle with glue in her hair come with the role. But so 
does the chance to explore important -- sometimes personal -- issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a collaborative effort," Treas says, describing monthly brainstorms among 
the cast and staff, one of which resulted in Monday's episode on child abuse, 
"The Touch." In the episode, Treas' character tries to reconnect with a 
Newcomer boy who has been purged of his capacity to love by an evil leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The writers came up with the idea that alien child abuse would be killing the 
love within a child, which is really what being abusive is," says Treas, who 
calls her own childhood home "dysfunctional." 
</P>
<P>
Although Treas chooses not to discuss the details of her past, she feels "part 
of my recovery is to give back what I've been given." To this end, she tried to 
give background on "how the abused child would act, and how Cathy would try to 
reach him." The episode's resulting climatic scene, she says, "was a very 
moving scene to shoot. It gave me chills." 
</P>
<P>
Treas spends some of her time out of makeup working with Children of the Night, 
a local shelter for children involved in prostitution and pornography, and Kid 
Power, an organization teaching children self-defense techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"To see these kids have this kind of empowerment is very inspiring," says 
Treas, who finds children to be more perceptive than adults. "The kids 
recognize me without my makeup on. Adults don't." LAUREN LIPTON

PASCOAL: A SPECIALIST IN 'UNIVERSAL MUSIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hermeto Pascoal, as iconoclastic with his thoughts as he is with his music, 
doesn't mince words. 
</P>
<P>
Take the lambada. The rotund, white-bearded, albino Brazilian 
multi-instrumentalist, who shares the bill with Egberto Gismonti at the 
Wadsworth Theatre tonight, has powerful feelings about the latest musical 
import from South of the border. 
</P>
<P>
"The lambada? Ha! Let me tell you something about that. To me, the lambada is 
worse than a disease. This lambada," explained Pascoal last week via his 
interpreter, keyboardist Jovino Santos Neto, "is not even Brazilian; it's from 
the Caribbean. To do this music is criminal, because instead of hurting your 
body, it hurts your soul." 
</P>
<P>
Pascoal is well qualified to speak authoritatively about Brazilian music, and 
improvised music in general, for that matter: his work both sums up and 
reflects the remarkable variety of creative elements active in it. On any given 
night, he may play ballads, free jazz, Brazilian pop or a symphony on pots, 
pans and hubcaps. 
</P>
<P>
"The only label I can apply to what I do," he said, "is 'Universal Music.' In 
one moment, you might hear something that you might call classical music; in 
the next moment something that you might call Gypsy or Spanish music; in the 
next moment some purely Brazilian popular things. 
</P>
<P>
"We see no distinction between all the different styles. We don't want to 
specialize in one line; we want to play music that is good music, and absorb 
all these different styles and then play them our own way." 
</P>
<P>
Pascoal spent his childhood working in the fields of northeast Brazil with his 
father, playing wooden flutes and a beat-up old hurdy gurdy. After discovering 
the piano, he wound up in Rio de Janeiro as part of one of the seminal 
Brazilian music groups, Quartet Novo. In the late '60s, he moved to the United 
States, where he recorded with Miles Davis, Airto Moriera and Flora Purim. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to Brazil in the mid-'70s, Pascoal formed the group which he 
has led, almost continuously, ever since. The players in the seven-piece band 
he will perform with in Los Angeles have been with him for an average of 10 
years each -- remarkable continuity for the sometimes ephemeral longevity of 
the music business. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we've been together for so long is that we never get bored 
from playing the same programs," he explained. "We don't even make a song list 
before we go on stage, and we never play pieces the same way. Everything is a 
surprise, for us and for our listeners." 
</P>
<P>
Gismonti, in marked contrast to Pascoal's romantic renegade, appears as the 
ascetic introvert -- dark and inner-focused. His current group includes the 
unusual combination of his own piano and guitar, cello, bass and a second 
guitarist. A classically-trained concert pianist who once studied with fabled 
composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, he brings to his music an intense mixture 
of European logic and Brazilian spiritualism. 
</P>
<P>
"We have many kinds of music in Brazil," said Gismonti, "from the very 
primitive music of the Amazon jungle to very developed electronic and symphonic 
music. The music I do uses all these elements, and there's no name for such a 
mixture, even in Brazil. The way the critics describe what people like Hermeto 
and me do is to say, 'Oh, that's Hermeto's music,' or 'Oh, that's Egberto's 
music.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gismonti has been especially affected by several visits to the Amazon and a 
long association with the Xingu Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing I learned from the Xingus was to be completely free," 
he recalled. "It is their way, the way they use the music. To them, music is 
not just sounds, it is the voice of the spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"Studying European music was important to me to learn about different 
instrumentations -- different combinations of instruments. I try to combine 
what I've learned from the European information with what I experienced with 
the Xingus in the Amazon -- to make myself free to play, to express, the voice 
of the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
As much as they may differ in style and manner, Pascoal and Gismonti both 
personify the tremendous range and complexity of Brazilian music -- from 
Pascoal's carnival-like feeling of celebration to Gismonti's synthesis of 
European classical music and Afro-Brazilian rhythms, and from Gismonti's 
expression of the Xingu Indians' spirit of music to Pascoal's emotional linkage 
of samba and jazz.

THE ROLLER-COASTER RIDE OF THE NEW AMERICAN ORCHESTRA; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: KEEPING A BIG BAND TOGETHER IS TOUGH IN THESE TIMES, BUT THIS ENSEMBLE 
WILL MARK 11 YEARS OF TOGETHERNESS AT A ROYCE HALL CONCERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problems involved in keeping a big band together have plagued musicians 
ever since the swing era ended. Where do you find jobs for 16 men? Whom do you 
commission to write for them and how do you pay them? Where can you travel, 
given the huge cost of plane fares? How do you keep the ensemble racially 
integrated? 
</P>
<P>
Multiply these questions by four or five and you have an idea of what has 
confronted the Foundation for New American Music, a nonprofit group under whose 
auspices the New American Orchestra, then 84 strong, started its roller-coaster 
life 11 years ago this week at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra will celebrate its anniversary tonight at Royce Hall, which will 
henceforth be its regular home. "Acoustically, it's the ideal place for us," 
says its director, Jack Elliott. "Also, after dropping down to 60, we've added 
some strings to bring it back up to 72, so we'll have the depth we need." 
</P>
<P>
Under Elliott's aegis, the orchestra has introduced 83 new works. Best 
remembered are Patrick Williams' "Concerto for Orchestra," which has been 
utilized in several forms since its premiere at the first concert in 1979, and 
two works by Manny Albam featuring saxophonists Phil Woods and Bud Shank. Best 
forgotten is a piece by Claus Ogerman written to feature trumpeter Freddie 
Hubbard. ("He didn't write it to show Freddie's strengths -- well, we played it 
anyway, and it was a disaster.") 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's program, typically, will mix pop, jazz and "legitimate" elements. 
Saxophonist Michael Brecker will make his first appearance with the NAO. Dave 
Grusin, joined by such sidemen as Harvey Mason, Abe Laboriel, Tom Scott and Sal 
Marquez, will play excerpts from his film scores. There will be three newly 
commissioned compositions: pianist Tom Garvin's "Day at the River," Patrick 
Williams' "Overture to a Time" and a movement from Clare Fischer's "Prelude and 
Fugue for Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
The last half hour, Elliott says, "will be a salute to the 50th anniversary of 
Broadcast Music Inc. -- a huge medley sung by Patti Austin, Jack Jones, Kenny 
Rankin and Phil Perry." 
</P>
<P>
The BMI medley clearly is the orchestra's quid pro quo, since that organization 
contributed "a big donation." Such deals are essential to the ensemble's 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
"That we are still alive after 11 years is due to sheer perseverance," Elliott 
says, "and to the devotion and help of a core group of financial supporters, 
along with major funding from a series of sponsors, including a Connecticut 
life insurance company, then AT&amp;T, and most recently Sanyo-Fisher, who will 
present us with a New York orchestra Sept. 8 in Avery Fisher Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Because no symphony orchestra gives composers the opportunities the eclectic 
NAO has offered, its existence is important, even though some critics have 
questioned its claim to be a symphonic jazz ensemble. (Elliott dislikes that 
label, claims he still can't find the right name tag, and wishes he could just 
refer to it as "the band.") 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a Catch-22 situation. During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the 
changes in the tax laws and the arts endowment situation have created enormous 
difficulties in fund-raising. We are told 'Go to the private sector,' but 
meanwhile they've taken away the inducement to the private sector to donate!" 
</P>
<P>
Another problem has been that of keeping the orchestra integrated. Recently 
Elliott talked with bassist John Clayton about keeping a line open to the black 
community. Clayton says: "I'm excited about it. I feel Jack is a doer, not a 
talker, and he really wants minorities represented. Some time in the next year 
I'll be writing something for the orchestra, and playing too." 
</P>
<P>
Finding new guest soloists who are willing to rehearse and perform is another 
constant challenge. Some of Elliott's fondest memories involve Sarah Vaughan. 
"She was foremost among the people who were truly supportive in those difficult 
early years. She came to the Chandler and worked for nothing. She was back 
there for our fifth anniversary, the night we had Quincy Jones; that night she 
sang with James Ingram. It's people like Sarah who have given us hope -- and 
believe me, it hasn't always been easy to keep hoping."

GUARDIAN OF BALLETS KEEPS CHOREOGRAPHER'S LEGEND ALIVE; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: NIJINSKA'S 'LE TRAIN BLEU' COMES TO PEPPERDINE FOR ONE PERFORMANCE TODAY 
AND 'LES NOCES' ARRIVES AT THE MUSIC CENTER FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It started with Vaslav Nijinsky, the fabled Russian dancer who turned the 
ballet world on its head and then lost his own to madness by 1917. 
</P>
<P>
It picked up with his sister, Bronislava Nijinska. She devoted herself to 
continuing the legend and went on to create her own landmark works for 
Diaghilev's glittery Ballets Russes -- where such elite collaborators as 
Cocteau, Stravinsky, Picasso, Balanchine, Milhaud and others were crafting the 
Paris-based repertory. 
</P>
<P>
And it continues today with the late Bronislava's 76-year-old daughter, Irina, 
who lives with her husband, Gibbs Raetz, a retired engineer, in her mother's 
green stucco house that overlooks ocean and canyon in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's one big difference," says the guardian of Bronislava's ballets, 
holding a letter just received from the Oleg Vinogradov of the Kirov Ballet 
inviting her to stage her mother's "Les Noces" in Leningrad. "This revival 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. With companies across the land and over the sea discovering the very 
roots of modern ballet in these masterworks, and with Los Angeles about to 
enjoy two different celebrations of the Nijinskys here on consecutive weekends, 
history edges into the present. 
</P>
<P>
"Le Train Bleu," which Irina reconstructed with Frank W. D. Ries for the 
Oakland Ballet, comes for a single performance today at Pepperdine. "Les 
Noces," which she staged for the Joffrey, comes to the Music Center next 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, 11 years after Diaghilev's death, a war-beleaguered Bronislava sought 
haven here. She arrived with her husband and daughter and set about being what 
a gifted choreographer of the wrong sex was virtually prohibited from being 
just a little earlier in Europe: an impresaria. 
</P>
<P>
"A married woman could not have her own passport or take a loan or open a bank 
account," says Irina Nijinska. "It all promised to happen (for Bronislava) in 
this strange and exotic place," she says, her words marked by a soft 
multi-language patois. "She put together a company that played Hollywood Bowl. 
There were the Tallchief girls -- Maria (at 14) and Marjorie (at 12). Everybody 
thought it was wonderful. But afterwards no one came to her support and she had 
no money to continue." 
</P>
<P>
From then on, Bronislava contented herself with the life of a missionary, 
traveling the world to stage both her own ballets and her brother's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only sorry (the revival) didn't happen in Nijinska's lifetime," says the 
daughter, speaking of her mother as an exalted figure. "But by putting on her 
ballets, I feel she's with me. I never go to the cemetery because she's here, 
not there. She wanted the recognition. Now she has it and I gave it to her 
through this legacy she left me." 
</P>
<P>
That legacy comprises 70 works. From 1921 to 1925, Nijinska was the only 
choreographer at Maison Diaghilev. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a jumper, like Vaslav. And Bronia (Bronislava) gave me a wonderful part 
in 'Biches' that showed off my elevation. But I didn't like being on pointe. I 
was a caractere dancer and preferred rehearsals to performances." 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder that she has the inspiration to painstakingly assemble the 
ballets from scratch -- and remains undaunted by the speculation of some 
critics: that the 1924 'Le Train Bleu," for instance, might be seen merely as 
historical curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
It was, after all, considered a frippery, one of those typically chic cocktail 
numbers Diaghilev loved so -- a spoof of the Riviera beach scene and music hall 
routines costumed by Coco Chanel herself. Nevertheless, tickets were harder to 
get than those for the train from Paris to Nice, after which it was named. 
</P>
<P>
"The ballet is certainly an important one," Nijinska insists -- for reasons 
other than the argument it provoked between her mother and Diaghilev, forcing 
the end of their association; she was inclined towards the abstract and he 
liked narrative ballets, with the librettist Cocteau standing on the 
impresario's side. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Train Bleu' shows a contrasting facet to the style of 'Les Noces,' which is 
architectural, and 'Les Biches,' which is neo-classic." 
</P>
<P>
No one, moreover, regards "Les Noces" as inconsequential. Nijinska proudly 
relates the comment of Jerome Robbins: "He told me that if he had seen it he 
would never have created his own ballet to the same Stravinsky score. Even the 
composer finally agreed to forgo his libretto. That's how cleverly the 
choreographer illustrated the music." 
</P>
<P>
Nijinska fingers the tiny black beads around her neck, the same ones, she says, 
that her grandmother wore to the Paris premiere of Vaslav's "Sacre du 
Printemps" and that she wore three years ago to the Joffrey's local revival of 
that ballet. There are so many memories: 
</P>
<P>
"Vaslav sitting on a chair in the sanitarium (where he would live out his 
psychotic alienation for another 30 years). It was 1921, in Vienna. He smiled, 
but did not recognize his mother or sister. 
</P>
<P>
"The pictures of family members in Kiev, most of them killed after the 1917 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of my mother's pregnancy with me, which kept her from going to 
Buenos Aires and rescuing Vaslav from Romola de Pulszky (whom he married, thus 
provoking Diaghilev to banish Nijinsky from the Ballets Russes). 
</P>
<P>
"My grandmother used to say that Vaslav was like a plant whose roots had been 
torn away when Diaghilev refused to let him come back." 
</P>
<P>
The Nijinskys, artistic revolutionaries whose brave new ballets attempted to 
set aside Romantic ideals, did not have an easy time -- to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
But the last champion of their lot shows no slackening of purpose. She points 
to boxes of archives, the material for the second volume of Bronislava's 
memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
"And in a few months," she says, I'll be off to Taipei, Sidney, Amsterdam, 
Lisbon and Monte Carlo. There are a few things to do."

SANTA ANA BEEFS UP GANG DETAIL TO STEM BLOODSHED IN STREETS 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Chief Paul M. Walters launched an unprecedented attack on the city's 
gangs Friday, sending 25 officers on a weekend sweep, doubling the size of the 
department's gang detail and threatening to hold parents responsible if their 
children violate a previously unenforced 10 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
"Gang violence is increasing in Orange County," Walters said at a press 
conference. "We want to take the individuals involved in gangs off the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
Walters' offensive comes a week after one of the city's bloodiest weekends, 
during which two teen-agers were killed by gang gunfire and another was 
seriously wounded along with an 8-year-old boy. So far this year, eight 
gang-related homicides and more than 50 gang-related shootings have occurred in 
Santa Ana. Countywide, there have already been 16 gang homicides -- the same 
number as last year's record total. 
</P>
<P>
Walters emphasized that the Santa Ana gang patrols, styled after the patrols 
that are periodically conducted by the Los Angeles Police Department, have been 
instructed not to arrest anyone without probable cause. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Rebecca Jurado, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties 
Union, said the sweeps may violate constitutional rights. In Los Angeles, 
police were similarly criticized by residents who claimed that youths were 
being arrested just because they looked like gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the sole propose of these sweeps is not to protect the 
neighborhoods but to arrest people," Jurado said. "The police are putting 
particular neighborhoods in a situation where the residents are not allowed to 
go outside if they wear the wrong clothes color." 
</P>
<P>
The first Santa Ana gang sweep began at 7 p.m. Friday and continued into the 
night, targeting neighborhoods where gangs are considered most active. The 
special patrol had just gotten under way when the police received calls of a 
drive-by shooting and a stabbing in gang-riddled areas. 
</P>
<P>
In the drive-by shooting, one person was shot in the foot, police said. There 
were no other details. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a typical Friday," Lt. David Salazar said. "We just have more 
officers that are able to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Two people who live in the neighborhood of the shooting at Walnut and Raitt 
streets welcomed the heavier police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time. We need them. It's getting desperate around here," said 
29-year-old Jose Alfaro. "I just hope this will work." 
</P>
<P>
More sweeps are expected to take place tonight and Sunday night. And if found 
effective, the weekend policing could continue indefinitely, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
The special gang suppression team, which includes traffic, canine and patrol 
units, is also being directed to strictly enforce traffic and probation laws. 
Those arrested Friday were taken to the department's substation on Bristol and 
McFadden streets, which was converted into a processing location. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were also expected to begin enforcing a 10 p.m. curfew that requires 
children under age 18 to be under adult supervision while in public places, 
Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Walters said, police legal advisers are researching whether 
parents of children who violate the curfew can be charged with a criminal 
misdemeanor punishable by a $600 fine or a short jail term. 
</P>
<P>
Walters also announced Friday that within two months he plans to double the 
size of the Santa Ana police gang detail, from four members to eight. 
</P>
<P>
The four additional officers will be primarily in charge of patrolling gang 
territory rather than investigating specific cases, Walters said. The city is 
estimated to have 60 gangs with 7,000 gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God they're finally listening and adding more officers," said Santa Ana 
City Councilman Richards L. Norton. "But it's too bad that it took so many 
deaths for them to do this. But (even with four more officers in the gang unit) 
make no mistake about this, it's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Walters said the decision to add the officers was not a result of the recent 
shootings, but has been in the planning for nearly a year. The Police 
Department was going to quietly add the officers onto its gang detail and its 
narcotics unit this year, but Walters said he decided to announce it publicly 
because of the media attention brought by the gang shootings. 
</P>
<P>
The new gang officers probably will be chosen from among the department's 
current 351-member roster, and four new officers will be hired to fill whatever 
vacancies occur. The cost of adding the officers is about $300,000 annually, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, each investigator in the four-member gang detail handles a monthly 
average of 13 high-priority cases, such as aggravated assaults or homicides, 
said police spokesman Lt. Robert Helton. Because of the large number of 
gang-related incidents in the city, gang investigators can handle only those 
cases with the best leads or most promising suspects, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Benevolent Assn., which represents the department's rank and file, 
has long called for expanding the gang detail. In a recent interview, union 
President Don Blankenship said gang officers are overworked and have little 
time to patrol the streets to prevent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, he said city officials have refused to hire additional officers 
because of budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"I know elected officials are as concerned about gang violence as I am," 
Blankenship said. "It's time to stop looking at this ongoing tragedy in the 
dollar-and-cent perspective."

BURIAL OF A 'HOME BOY': A CROSSROAD OF SORROW AND RAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
As Cesar Salgado's body was lowered into a grave shortly before noon Friday, a 
youth wearing a sweat shirt with "Nite Owl, RIP" written on the back dropped a 
black and white kerchief that came to rest on the gray coffin. 
</P>
<P>
A bullet fired from a passing car ended the 15-year-old Cesar's life a few 
minutes after midnight Sunday, as he was leaving a party with a friend in Santa 
Ana. Police say the murder on East Walnut Street is gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
But for Cesar's friends and schoolmates, many calling themselves "home boys," a 
painful process was just beginning. These youths, the boys with their black 
hair slicked back and wearing either white T-shirts or black sweat shirts, and 
the girls with their bangs combed up as high as peacocks, were at a crossroad 
of sorrow and rage. 
</P>
<P>
And the adults in their lives -- from parents to school officials -- have been 
working all week to lead them away from the kind of anger and violence that 
killed Salgado and another youth during a weekend of gang gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to emphasize to them that we all loved Cesar and we want to see his 
memory live on by being the best, and not by lying next to him dead, or 
following in the traditional track of blood for blood," said Spurgeon Middle 
School Principal Cathy Makin, who knew the boy. "We try to tell them that the 
suffering and the killing has to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Cesar was a student at Horizon High School and spent three years at Spurgeon 
Middle School, which his younger brother Rafael still attends. 
</P>
<P>
At Spurgeon, in fact, Cesar was one of several students who appeared in an 
anti-gang video produced by the county Department of Education's gang-diversion 
program, Operation Safe Schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Cesar's death, students at Spurgeon were so moved that they 
wrote essays on the slaying as part of their state-required California 
Assessment Program tests. Makin said she wrote state officials to explain why 
the students strayed from the essay's state-assigned topic. 
</P>
<P>
A Mass was recited at Immaculate Heart Catholic Church for Cesar, who was known 
as Nite Owl because he liked to stay up late. Then he was buried at Fairhaven 
Memorial Park. Family and friends waited patiently as cemetery workers in green 
uniforms shoveled dirt on the casket. When the union crew broke for lunch 
before filling the grave, family members knelt on the ground to pray until the 
workers returned to complete the job. 
</P>
<P>
Juan and Susana Salgado sat dabbing at their eyes as their son's body was 
lowered into the ground. He works as an office custodian and she is a hotel 
maid. Cesar was the second of four children, all boys. 
</P>
<P>
Was Cesar a gang member as some youths in his neighborhood claimed? Some 
friends outside the funeral home nodded yes; others said no. "He was a home 
boy, but he wasn't a criminal," one youth said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cesar has never been in Juvenile Hall," a friend named Jess said. "He was just 
a cool guy who liked to kick back." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the youths, the boys as well as the girls, say they resent being lumped 
together with gang members who dress like them and commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"All the time you talk about home boys, you're not talking about criminals," a 
girl named Betty said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're different," said another girl named Sonia. "They (the police and others) 
don't know us from the inside, just from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Gus Frias, manager of the Operation Safe Schools program, said that all week 
since the shootings he and other school officials have been counseling the 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk to them about pay-back, about peer pressure and about how you deal 
with that," Frias said. "That is real. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 approach I use is respect for the family," he said. "I tell them to 
think about Cesar's mother, think about what this would do to her if something 
else happens. Because what these kids hear from others is, 'You don't have any 
guts. If you loved (Cesar), you'd go down there and kill for him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cesar's oldest brother, Juan, 17, said there would be no payback. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother told me not to listen to no one," Juan said. "You try to be good, 
and other people see that as a sign of weakness," he continued. "A lot of 
things are running through a lot of people's heads. What's in my head? I don't 
want to go to jail. I think Cesar would want what our mom wanted, to have this 
rest in peace, me and her both. But I know there are a lot of people who have 
some hard feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Cesar's father said he will never understand the viciousness that is ripping 
apart the neighborhoods near their Eastside home. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all Mexicans, why aren't we being supportive of each other instead of 
killing each other," said the older Salgado, who came here from Mexico in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have believed how much violence I would see," he said. "As a 
parent, one has to take more precautions for one's own children. People don't 
pay enough attention to their children. My kids are no angels, but they always 
ask me permission before they go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"My son had nothing to do with those people who did this to him," he said. 
"That's what hurts so much."

THIS EXPANSION PLAN'S ONE FOR THE BOOKS; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC WORKS: CORONA WAS TO PAY FOR MORE THAN TRIPLING THE CITY LIBRARY WITH 
$7.4 MILLION IN BONDS, PASSED IN 1988. BUT COSTS HAD BEEN UNDERESTIMATED.

<P>
Expansion of the Corona Public Library will begin in March, two years behind 
schedule and at double the original estimated cost, but library officials say 
it will be worth the wait and extra money. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the city's only library will increase in size from 16,000 
square feet to 58,800 square feet. Completion is scheduled for April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we've been working on it for ages," said Roger Clements, deputy 
library director. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had hoped to pay for the project with a $7.4-million bond issue, 
which was passed by more than 70% of the voters in April, 1988. But about a 
year after the election, planners found that their original consultants had 
based the price on rough outlines and consequently underestimated costs. 
</P>
<P>
The city has since hired Charles Walton Associates, a Glendale architectural 
firm, which found that the cost would actually be $15.1 million, Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply did not obtain the best cost estimate," said Tom Paradise, chairman 
of the library's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Money to make up the difference will come from reserves the city had set aside 
to renovate the Civic Center, said Ken Fischer, assistant to the city manager. 
That project still is in the conceptual stage and several years away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue failed to cover the full costs of upgrading the existing 
building for seismic safety, access for the handicapped and installation of 
fire-suppression systems, Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
The plans call for 7,200 square feet of office space to be built under the 
library, now the site of a subterranean parking lot. Originally, project 
planners mistakenly classified the new offices as a renovation project, which 
carries lower costs than new construction. Now reclassified as a construction 
project, the cost of the offices has jumped from $600,000 to $972,000, Clements 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The library project has also been delayed because officials canceled plans to 
buy neighboring property on Sixth Street for a new parking lot. That land faces 
the city's downtown district and is expensive real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city bought less expensive land on the southwest corner of the 
library for the parking lot, Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes more sense to acquire property that is not prime real estate," 
Paradise said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all the delays hurt the city because construction costs since 1985 
have risen 28%, Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
"The time element -- that's $1.4 million in and of itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded library will include conference, copying, personal computer and 
typing rooms, as well as an audiovisual section and an area for literacy 
programs. The look of the building will change with the addition of skylights 
and a new entrance on the southwest corner. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials said the new facilities will make the wait worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I come to work, it seems like we have to change the chairs around 
to get enough seating," library director Cynthia Dee said. "It hardly allows us 
to keep up with the people coming in." 
</P>
<P>
The increased demands on the library were especially evident April 16, when 
federal and state tax forms were due. More than 1,500 people -- one-third more 
than normal -- visited the library, many of them to use the copy machine for 
their tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
With the expansion, there will be less havoc because crowds will be able to 
wait in line in the copy room instead of the main section of the library, 
Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have (the expanded library) very functional," he said. "That's the 
word -- a functional library everyone can use."

FORMER CURATOR REGRETS NOT QUITTING EARLIER; 
</P>
<P>
ART: MUCKENTHALER MUSEUM'S EX-SUPERVISOR SAYS HE SHOULD HAVE QUIT WHEN FIRST 
TOLD TO YANK THE LENNON PHOTO. HE AND BOARD CHAIRWOMAN AGREE THAT BLURRED LINES 
OF AUTHORITY LED TO THE BROUHAHA.

Norman Lloyd, who resigned Thursday as curator at the Muckenthaler Cultural 
Center amid controversy over a nude photo of John Lennon, now says he should 
have quit when trustees first told him to take down the work. 
</P>
<P>
And board chairwoman Beverly Gunter, who took responsibility for having the 
work removed from the exhibit in the first place, says if she could "turn back 
the clock" she would never have taken the action that precipitated Lloyd's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd and Gunter, the two principals in the Muckenthaler brouhaha, agree that a 
failure to define the relationship between the curator and trustees in 
selecting art for exhibits touched off the events that thrust the city-run 
gallery into the national debate on art and censorship. 
</P>
<P>
It is that blurring of lines between between professional staff and trustees at 
Muckenthaler that has alarmed arts professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can have an overreaction to a situation like that," Hugh 
Davies, director of the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, said Friday. 
"Whenever one institution is threatened with this kind of censorship, it 
threatens all institutions." 
</P>
<P>
The disputed photograph, by Annie Leibovitz, shows a nude Lennon curled in a 
fetal position and embracing his wife, Yoko Ono. It was removed before the show 
opened last week after several trustees who previewed the show objected to the 
photograph on the grounds that it portrayed Lennon as "weak" and thus did not 
fit the theme of the show, "Heroes, Heroines, Idols and Icons." 
</P>
<P>
After several days of controversy and intense media interest, Muckenthaler 
trustees voted Thursday night to restore the Lennon photo to the show, but 
Lloyd resigned minutes after the vote, saying the board had usurped his 
authority by first removing the photo, then voting to restore it. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said that he accepted the initial demand to hold the work from the show 
until the full board of trustees voted on the issue. But that backfired, and he 
now acknowledges that he compromised his position as curator in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize the overall impact of letting these people at all into the 
decision-making process," Lloyd said Friday. "I was hoping we could negotiate 
and get the work back in, but I should have stuck to my guns." 
</P>
<P>
Searching for direction, he called and spoke to several arts professionals 
during the week and said the verdict was unanimous: "They just said, 'Realize 
the impact of what you're doing,' " Lloyd recounted. "Whatever happens, it 
cannot imply that the board has the right to curate the show." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum, was one person he called. 
Desmarais said he told Lloyd, "It's our responsibility, those of us entrusted 
with museums and similar institutions, to be leaders. . . . We need to show 
leadership to our boards and stand for freedom of artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais said the controversy arose because the Muckenthaler does not have a 
clear policy delineating the responsibilities of staff and trustees. Desmarais 
added that he moved to define policy at his own museum soon after taking the 
director's post in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At most arts institutions, according to Desmarais and Davies, the curator 
answers to the director and the director answers to the board, thus providing a 
cushion between staff and trustees. The trustees give general direction, set 
long-range policy and attend to the financial well-being of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
"The day-to-day management of the institution is very much up to the staff," 
Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
"My trustees understand completely that the decision to display the works is 
entirely that of the curators and the professional staff," Davies added. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Schimmel, until recently the curator of the Newport Harbor Art Museum and 
now chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, said he 
sometimes wrangled with the board over artistic direction in his 10 years at 
Newport Harbor. But he said he was never pressured to remove a specific 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
At the Muckenthaler, Lloyd and center director Judith Peterson invited trustees 
to preview the show because they thought another Leibovitz photo, of artist 
Keith Haring, would stir controversy. There are mixed reports over the exact 
reason the trustees were called in. Lloyd says now it was merely a courtesy, 
but board chairwoman Gunter said at Thursday's meeting that she had been asked 
to take part in the selection process. Peterson said the board's role in 
viewing the work was left unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be sensible to warn trustees that sensitive material would be 
presented," Davies said, but it is enough to give them advance notice, not to 
solicit their opinion or allow them to edit the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Davies' concerns were reflected by those of the artist. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the troubling features of this situation is that the board took on 
itself to review and to alter the contents of the exhibition," photographer 
Leibovitz said in a statement released Friday. "There is an increasing tendency 
for boards to interfere with the work of curators and artistic directors, and 
the boards' decisions are almost always on the side of greater conformity." 
</P>
<P>
Gunter and Peterson both said setting policy at the Muckenthaler is the main 
goal for the board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leibovitz REACTION: Though happy the picture is back, the photographer says 
she's still disturbed by the center's earlier actions. F1

EVERYBODY WINS IN SPECIAL GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 540 athletes from central and north Orange County received gold medals 
after participating Friday in the Special Games at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Two students at Cal State Fullerton began the games in 1986 as a 
less-competitive version of the Special Olympics, said Mary Ann Faley, one of 
the games' volunteer organizers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our emphasis in this is they are all winners," Faley said. All participants 
are awarded gold medals and T-shirts no matter where they finished in the 
various events. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the special athletes competed in a softball and Frisbee toss, 
several running races, a long jump and an obstacle course. About 300 volunteers 
from the university and the community helped supervise the event. 
</P>
<P>
After the competition, athletes were treated to an afternoon barbecue, with 
food and supplies donated by local companies.

BABY DIES AFTER HOT TUB ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 1-year-old girl who was found in her family's back-yard hot tub has died 
after four days of medical care failed to revive her, hospital officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kazarina Hariluk had been sustained on life-support equipment in "extremely 
critical condition" in Childrens Hospital of Orange County after she was found 
in her parents' hot tub April 20, doctors said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the girl died Tuesday, but they declined to elaborate, 
citing a request from the family. A coroner's report listed the cause of death 
simply as drowning, said David Machian, a deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the accident, neighbors on Point Loma Drive in Corona del Mar 
rallied to support the family, posting red paper hearts bearing Kazarina's name 
on garage doors and car windows. On Friday, neighbors were still dismayed over 
news of the child's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the neighborhood has been crushed," said Fran Schmidt, 47. "This 
is a parent's worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"The family seems to be holding up fairly well," she added. "They seem to be 
regaining their composure." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel awful over the tragedy," said Hy Algazi, 56. "I'm a father of two kids, 
and it's heartbreaking to think this could have happened to my kids." 
</P>
<P>
The drowning was the third in a pool or spa in Orange County this year. A 
5-year-old Walnut girl drowned in early April in her grandmother's pool. One 
day later, a 36-year-old woman drowned in her neighbor's pool in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The perils of back-yard pools are particularly acute for children, said Midge 
Tobin, a program director for the Orange County Trauma Society. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a misconception that it always happens to parents who aren't 
careful with their children," Tobin said. "It happens quickly and quietly. It 
happens when the parents, grandparents or baby-sitter leaves the child 
unattended for just a second." MICHAEL ASHCRAFT

TRAVEL IS BROADENING FOR OCC STUDENTS

A group of Orange Coast College students who took part in the school's first 
"semester abroad" program have learned there's a world of difference between 
Costa Mesa and Costa Rica. But it was these contrasts -- particularly the 
environment and language -- that led to the creation of the program in Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Botany and ecology professor John Lenanton and Spanish professor Susana Salessi 
put together the 15-week study program after a 1988 visit to the college by 
Carlos Rivera, a Costa Rican government official. The teachers were attracted 
by Costa Rica's stable politics and educational opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not another place that can compete with Costa Rica with regard to 
diversity of habitat," Lenanton said. 
</P>
<P>
Students were attracted by the opportunity to live in another country. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always interested in the environment and I wanted to learn a language in 
a neutral country that has good relations with the United States," student 
Julie Rona said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Coast College group arrived in Costa Rica in January. Classes have 
been held at the Institututo Centroamericano de Asuntos Internacionales -- the 
Central American Institute for International Affairs -- in San Jose. The 
institute provided classrooms and a political science instructor, organized

FAMILY CARE STRATEGY IS READY FOR ACTION

<TEXT>
<P>
A city-sponsored committee charged with developing a local family care strategy 
has concluded six months of work and is calling on community agencies and 
business leaders to help put the plans into action. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to continue as a group to make sure it is implemented as it is 
supposed to be implemented," said Christopher K. Jarvi, director of Anaheim's 
Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Anaheim Family Care Consortium came up with a list of problems 
most often encountered by those seeking and providing care for children and 
elderly family members, and a five-year plan for dealing with those problems. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 issues targeted were the lack of programs to care for infants and 
toddlers and the scarcity of before- and after-school care for elementary and 
junior high students. 
</P>
<P>
At a Friday breakfast, the group presented a booklet offering Anaheim employers 
information about meeting the family care needs of their workers. By the end of 
next month, the group will distribute a directory of local care facilities for 
children, senior citizens and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Family Care Consortium started with a $20,000 state grant that paid 
for the services of a consultant for six months. The group will now be on its 
own and plans to meet on a monthly basis. LISA MASCARO

DANNEMEYER LETTER 'ABSURD,' GATES SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) protested to Los Angeles Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates last week about "absurd" police tactics in arresting 
abortion protesters at a clinic, his letter was a fusillade of anger. 
</P>
<P>
He accused Gates' officers of being "repeat offenders" in the use of "Bull 
Connor" techniques to arrest nonviolent protesters. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman accused Gates of playing favorites by using less aggressive 
police tactics when the protesters were "the Hollywood Dog-and-Pony show (Jane 
Fonda, Martin Sheen, et al)." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer also threatened to see to it that Los Angeles loses federal 
community development grants over it. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Gates fired off his own volley of insults to Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
"Your letter . . . is so absurd that I almost decided not to answer it," Gates 
began. The police chief went on to call the congressman's letter "an outrageous 
diatribe, coming from a member of Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Gates added that he knew about the federal law that can cause some cities to 
lose federal funds if police are found guilty of mistreating abortion 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"I am well aware of the extortionary law that you and others like you put into 
effect. . . ," Gates wrote. "You can investigate until hell freezes over and 
you will find nothing in the actions of the Los Angeles Police Department that 
would prevent Title II funds from coming to this community." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 250 people were arrested April 14 after anti-abortion protesters 
descended on a mid-Wilshire clinic. More than 300 police officers controlled 
the crowd and made arrests. Some of the protest leaders complained about police 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer suggested in his letter that if Gates' did not straighten up his 
department, "the voters of Los Angeles will treat you like a batter at Dodger 
Stadium and say 'Three strikes, you're out.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Gates had him on that one. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike a congressman who sputters, blusters, threatens, and writes highly 
inappropriate letters, I am not elected," Gates wrote. "I am just one of those 
dumb bureaucrats who has had more strikes thrown at him than most. . . . I am 
still not out, and your stupid letter will not drive me out. And unlike you, I 
have a duty to all the people and not just one special interest fringe group." 
</P>
<P>
Both Gates and Dannemeyer signed their letters: "Sincerely." JERRY HICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Fighting back the tears, Wendy Ward recalled in court Friday the horror of 
seeing her husband struck without warning and carried on the hood of her 
stepmother's Mercedes-Benz before he tumbled into the street, fatally injured. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, 31, of Costa Mesa testified on the first day of a hearing that will 
determine whether to try Betty Young Davies on charges of involuntary 
manslaughter and felony hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
Davies, 58, of Newport Beach is accused of running down James R. Ward about 8 
p.m. Dec. 19 during a confrontation in front of the Wards' home at 840 Congress 
St. in Costa Mesa. A 31-year-old father of two children, he sustained severe 
head injuries and died four days later at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I was yelling at Jim to move," Wendy Ward testified before a courtroom filled 
with friends and relatives. "She started the car. I heard the motor racing. 
Then she hit him." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum, Ward said her 
stepmother did not honk, give a warning or try to avoid hitting her husband, 
who was standing about two feet in front of the maroon Mercedes-Benz 500 SEL. 
</P>
<P>
After her husband was struck, she recalled, Davies sped away and did not stop. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no chance to move," she said as she broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's testimony in Harbor Municipal Court indicated that the fatal encounter 
with Davies began about 7:45 p.m. when a neighbor, Wendy Bidner, spotted Davies 
spying on the Ward home from behind a tree across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Bidner said she called the Wards to warn them and later overheard what she 
considered threatening remarks that Davies made to James Ward. She recalled 
that Wendy Ward soon came out and yelled at her stepmother: "Get out of here! 
Leave us alone!" 
</P>
<P>
Ward said she and her husband confronted Davies in the street in front of their 
home and persistently demanded to know why she was there, but Davies did not 
answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset by her presence," she testified. "We were not friendly with her. 
She was not an invited guest. She didn't acknowledge anything." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Wards' relationship with Davies had been difficult for several 
years. Records show that the couple complained at least four times that the 
stepmother had vandalized their car, made annoying phone calls and had spied on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident, the paint on the Wards' Honda Civic was scratched with a sharp 
object from bumper to bumper, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Ward testified that on the day of her husband's death, the two of them 
finally escorted Davies to her car, which was parked down the block from their 
home. She recalled that her husband never struck Davies or her car before he 
was run down. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Attorney Marshall M. Schulman declined to comment on the testimony. 
Schulman is scheduled to question Wendy Ward on Monday when the preliminary 
hearing resumes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad situation all around," Schulman said. "It will all come out in the 
wash, but I don't want to put any fuel on the fire right now." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's hearing was repeatedly disrupted and delayed by legal sparring between 
Rosenblum and Schulman, prompting warnings by Judge Susanne S. Shaw. At one 
point, Shaw threatened both attorneys with contempt if they could not control 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sixth-graders," Shaw said. "Let's get on with it. You are so busy 
bantering around that we can't get the facts out."

VILLA PARK GIVES FOOTHILL ANOTHER LONG DAY, 15-1

<P>
Foothill High School's slide in the Century League baseball standings continued 
Friday as Villa Park pounded the host Knights, 15-1. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill committed nine errors and three pitchers gave up 16 hits as Villa Park 
enjoyed its highest run total of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth loss in the past six league games for Foothill (8-12-1, 5-5-1 
in league play), which has lost three starters with injuries, including one of 
the county's best pitchers, Kent Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for (Foothill Coach) Gerry (Sedoo) after this one," Villa Park 
Coach Dave Ochoa said. "He's got one of the best high school pitchers in 
Southern California and can't use him." 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly is suffering from a lower back strain and Sedoo said the senior 
right-hander won't pitch again this season. Sedoo used Donnelly as the 
designated hitter and he struck out twice and doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park starter Kurt Luhrsen (3-3) allowed only four hits and struck out 
eight, losing his shutout in the fourth inning when Jason Martian misplayed a 
fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park (13-7-1, 6-5) will play two games against league-leading Canyon next 
week, and Ochoa was encouraged with Luhrsen's performance going into the big 
series. 
</P>
<P>
"Kurt got more aggressive on the mound as we got more aggressive at the plate," 
Ochoa said. "The last time we played Foothill, they hammered Todd Blyleven for 
10 hits. I thought Kurt pitched a great game today." 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff batter Aaron Boone, son of Kansas City Royal catcher Bob Boone, led 
Villa Park with three hits and scored four runs. Martian had three hits and 
drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park broke open a close game with six runs in the fifth inning and added 
five runs in the sixth, when Foothill committed four errors. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Sedoo tried to explain a promising season that has gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
"We started losing players before the spring break, and then compounded our 
problems during the break with fielding errors and mental breakdowns," he said. 
"We haven't played well since the break. I'm just hoping we can snap out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 6, El Modena 5 (10 innings) -- El Modena scored a run in 10th but 
host Santa Ana (10-11, 6-5) rallied back for two runs with the help of three 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 3, Santa Ana Valley 2 (10 innings) -- Mike Casagranda singled with one 
out in the 10th and was replaced by pinch-runner Chuck Nickerson, who later 
scored the winning run on a single by Bob Thompson. Greg Tippin (2-3) pitched 
10 innings with 10 strikeouts for the victory. Scott Crosby hit a solo home run 
for Santa Ana Valley in the third.

If you want to know why Kennedy High School's baseball team usually plays a 
little better against Garden Grove League powerhouse La Quinta, all you have to 
do is look at the championship banners on the Aztecs' center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy recorded its fourth consecutive victory over La Quinta Friday, scoring 
four times in the first inning en route to a 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal pointed to La Quinta's banners, which list the 14 
years the Aztecs have reached the Southern Section playoffs -- including an 
unbroken string since 1977 -- and the school's seven league championships. 
</P>
<P>
"All you've got to do is look out there," Pascal said. "Our kids get real 
excited to play La Quinta because they know they're going up against one of the 
best baseball programs in Orange County. We always have close, exciting games, 
and that's the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (12-11, 7-3 in league) moved to within a game of first-place La Quinta 
(17-7, 8-2). 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's first three batters in the first inning -- Craig Roah, Rod Rosales 
and Scott Wood -- singled off right-hander Walter Dawkins (5-3). Scott Jones 
cleared the bases with a double to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
Jones scored when La Quinta shortstop Jason Cherms made the first of his four 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy right-hander Brian Faddoul (5-4) allowed only five singles and struck 
out eight. La Quinta had baserunners in every inning except the first, but 
Faddoul snuffed Aztec rallies with strikeouts in each of the last four innings. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta's only run came in the second, when catcher Matt Logan singled and 
went to second on Faddoul's throwing error. Logan moved to third on a grounder 
to short and scored when Don Hopkins hit a high chopper to third. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't trying to get fancy," Faddoul said. "I knew I had to go right at them 
because we got up on them early." 
</P>
<P>
Faddoul has been inconsistent since March 23, when he pitched a perfect game 
against Bolsa Grande. But Faddoul, a 5-foot-10 junior, picked up a new pitch 
recently -- a sharp-breaking slider -- and he used it Friday to record several 
of his strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Faddoul didn't have his dominating stuff, but he had enough to get by," La 
Quinta Coach Dave Demarest said. "Good pitchers do that. They learn to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 5, Bolsa Grande 2 -- Garden Grove only had two hits but took 
advantage of nine walks and two errors at home. Joe Aguirre (3-5) pitched a 
three-hitter, struck out 12 and walked two for Garden Grove (8-11, 5-5). 
</P>
<P>
Santiago 7, Rancho Alamitos 6 -- Santiago (13-7, 7-3) scored a run on two 
errors and a passed ball in the bottom of the seventh for the victory. Steve 
Garza reached on an error but was out when Cip Cruz hit into a fielder's 
choice. Cruz took second on a passed ball and scored when Rancho Alamitos' 
first baseman couldn't handle a ground ball. There were 15 errors in the game, 
Santiago committing 10 of them.

Aaron Boone of Edison High School has signed a letter of intent to play 
volleyball at USC this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Boone, a 6-foot-5 setter, will join former Orange County standouts Jason 
Perkins (Corona del Mar), Chris Knowles (Dana Hills) and Drew Sheward (Newport 
Harbor). 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA also wanted him but he had already made up his mind," Edison Coach Brian 
Rofer said. "UC Santa Barbara recruited him too, and I know a lot of other 
schools would have loved to have him." 
</P>
<P>
Rofer, who played volleyball at UCLA, said Boone has a chance to start as a 
freshman at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1996 I think he has good shot at the Olympic team," Rofer said. "He'll be 
done with school by then and I can't see anyone touching him." MIKE REILLEY

JAPANESE PUBLISHER SAYS STATISTICS DISTORT TRADE SURPLUS 
</P>

<P>
A prominent Japanese publisher said Friday that Japan's trade surplus with the 
United States is not as bad as "outmoded" statistical methods by the U.S. 
government make it seem. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiaki Ogasawara, publisher and chairman of the Japan Times, the oldest 
English-language newspaper in Japan, said about 30% of Japan's exports to the 
United States are produced by U.S. subsidiaries in Japan, and that the Japanese 
government has "no control whatsoever over these types of exports." In 
compiling its trade figures, however, the U.S. Commerce Department does not 
always distinguish between products made by U.S. firms in Japan and those made 
by Japanese companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Texas Instruments as an example, he said the semiconductor maker has 
moved much of its computer chip production to Japan. The chips that Texas 
Instruments sends back to the United States for assembly have been registered 
by the Commerce Department as imports from Japan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ogasawara said such a manufacturing operation makes it "virtually impossible" 
for Japan to comply with a trade pact signed in March requiring that country to 
reduce its computer chip exports to the United States by 20% over time. The 
Japanese publisher spoke Friday to members of the Orange County chapter of the 
Japan America Society of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Until the U.S. government revises the way it collects trade data, Japan will 
continue to show a massive trade surplus and U.S.-Japan trade frictions will 
continue to be tense, Ogasawara said. He spoke just minutes before President 
Bush announced Friday that Japan was not included in the "hit list" of 
countries with the worst trade barriers against U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
Globalization of business means that "the customary statistics concerning 
imports and exports are becoming increasingly meaningless" as companies buy 
more components from abroad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If (U.S.) politicians continue to take decisions on the basis of outmoded 
statistical data based on 19th-Century ideas about trade, then clearly friction 
can only continue between our countries," Ogasawara said.

SEC STOPS COMPANY FROM TRADING IN PENNY STOCKS 
</P>

<P>
In the latest round in a decade-long struggle with penny stock mogul Meyer 
Blinder, federal regulators on Friday suspended the firm he founded, Blinder 
Robinson, from trading in the low-cost, high-risk securities for 45 days and 
from underwriting such offerings for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an administrative action, also 
barred Blinder himself from associating with any registered broker-dealer for 
at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in Washington for the firm and Blinder were out of their offices 
Thursday afternoon and had not returned a reporter's telephone call for comment 
by evening. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the SEC's enforcement division were at a conference Friday and also 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, however, such findings are appealable either to the full commission 
or to a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
Blinder, 69, of Denver, and four associates were indicted in February on 
racketeering and securities fraud charges by a federal grand jury in Las Vegas. 
The indictment followed a 1988 Internal Revenue Service raid on Blinder 
Robinson's Denver office. 
</P>
<P>
Blinder Robinson was once the nation's largest penny stock brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks are low-cost, high-risk securities, usually trading for less than 
$3 per share. They are not listed on stock exchanges and thus reliable, 
up-to-the-minute information about them is hard to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
That makes penny stocks -- which typically are used to raise capital for new or 
small companies -- prone to fraud by unscrupulous traders and promoters. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC action dates back to the early 1980s and has see-sawed through hearings 
in the federal courts in Denver and Washington, as well as administrative 
actions before the full commission and administrative law judges. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC has accused Blinder and the firm of fraud and manipulative practices 
involving the securities of America Leisure Corp., a firm that told investors 
it planned to build and operate an Atlantic City, N.J., casino-hotel. However, 
it only owned 1.72 acres of land in Atlantic City, an area deemed too small for 
such a venture.

LENNON PHOTOGRAPHER HAPPY WORK IS BACK;

ART: BUT ANNIE LEIBOVITZ IS STILL DISTURBED BY THE EARLIER ACTIONS OF

Photographer Annie Leibovitz issued a statement Friday saying she is "glad" 
that her nude portrait of John Lennon is again part of the Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center's "Heroes, Heroines, Idols and Icons" show. But she added a 
cautionary note. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear this is not the last time this sort of censorship will be attempted," 
she said. "In the current political climate, people are running scared. What 
worries me is how much self-censorship there is. Artists and cultural 
institutions are anticipating controversy and backing off from something they 
think might be criticized. This is no way to run a culture -- or a free 
country." 
</P>
<P>
The portrait -- which appeared on newsstands around the world nearly 10 years 
ago, as a cover of Rolling Stone magazine -- had been removed by some trustees 
who said they didn't think it was in keeping with the show's theme. Thursday, 
after nearly a week's worth of controversy, the full board of trustees voted 
unanimously to put the picture back on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
But though Lennon's portrait was back, eight photographs of homeless men by 
Mark Story had been taken down. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the trustees' reversal, Story sent a telegram to the center Friday 
asking for the immediate return of his works, which had been part of the same 
exhibit. "I don't like the general smell of pressure (when) art that isn't 
deemed acceptable (is) removed from a show," he said. Friday afternoon, 
according to a spokeswoman for the center, Story's pieces were being packaged 
for shipping. 
</P>
<P>
Curator Norman Lloyd, who himself has resigned over the controversy, was 
nonetheless upset by Story's action. "He's made his statement," Lloyd said 
Friday. "Now all he's doing is ruining the show. Why punish the whole city for 
the actions of a few?"

LOOKING INTO HER PAST -- 15 GENERATIONS AGO; 
</P>
<P>
LATINO GENEALOGIST TO HELP PORTRAY A HISTORIC THANKSGIVING EVENT OF 1598 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Nearly 400 years ago, Pedro Robledo left Mexico with the Juan de Ornate 
expedition, venturing into what is now New Mexico, to become one of the first 
settlers in that region. Today, his 13th-great-granddaughter, Pauline Chavez 
Bent, a genealogist who specializes in Latino history, travels uncharted 
terrain of a different nature, searching back through time to meticulously 
piece together her family's history. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by photos of family members, present and past, in her Huntington 
Beach home, Chavez Bent, 62, carefully unrolled an extensive, wide scroll -- a 
15-generation pedigree chart. She ran her finger up and down the generations, 
looking for one name among 1,050. "Here," she pointed to a name. "This is 
Pedro. This is my 13th-great-grandfather." 
</P>
<P>
On April 30, 1598, Robledo and other members of the Ornate group, camped along 
the banks of the Rio Grande River near what is now El Paso, Tex. After 
preparing a meal from the fish, geese and ducks found there, they knelt and 
gave thanks that they had survived their journey. 
</P>
<P>
This little-known historic moment was the first recorded American Thanksgiving, 
occurring 23 years before the Pilgrims ate their renowned Thanksgiving dinner 
at Plymouth Rock, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in the courtyard of Santa Ana's Bowers Museum, the Hispanic Family 
History Researchers, an Orange County-based genealogy group, will commemorate 
the event with a re-enactment called "The First Thanksgiving -- 1598." As a 
member of the genealogical group, Chavez Bent researched the material for the 
play, which fellow genealogist Mimi Lozano-Holtzman scripted. 
</P>
<P>
The drama is part of the sixth annual Hispanic Family History Seminar, a 
daylong series of workshops and presentations featuring professional 
genealogists and a number of exhibits. The Hispanic Family History Researchers, 
under the auspices of the Mexican-American Arts Council and sponsored by the 
Bowers Museum, has helped plan the event, Chavez Bent said. "The First 
Thanksgiving" theatrical presentation, which starts at noon, is free to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Eight performers in the cast, including Chavez Bent, are actual descendants of 
the original colonizers of New Mexico. Chavez Bent will portray Robledo's wife, 
her 13th great-grandmother, Catalina Lopez. "Some people have the idea that 
just soldiers came to New Mexico, and they married Indian women," she said. 
"But that isn't so. A lot of the men who came with Ornate brought their wives." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Atarque, N.M., Chavez Bent grew up listening to her family's verbal 
history, remembrances passed on to her by her mother, Isabelita Chavez. 
Although she wrote her first family tree in 1956 after the birth of her first 
daughter, it wasn't until 10 years ago that Chavez Bent started to trace her 
ancestral roots. "I thought I was a hotshot researcher then because I had 
traced five generations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago Chavez Bent began her serious research. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has uncovered 85% of the family history she now has recorded. 
"But I've been lucky," she emphasized. "The records have been precise." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, researching Latino families is easier than tracing Anglo 
ones, Chavez Bent said. "Most Hispanics were Catholics, so there were baptismal 
records, marriage records and prenuptial investigations. We're lucky, in a 
sense, that our ancestors were Catholics, because they kept very good records." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez Bent noted with irony that much of her family's history was recorded 
because of her more infamous ancestors, one of whom was accused of being a 
bigamist. "People who weren't criminals or bigamists, who didn't get involved 
in those types of activities, never ended up in any books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Hispanic Family History Researchers last October, Chavez Bent 
has pooled her research efforts with other researchers. "Prior to joining the 
group, most of us were researching in virtual isolation," she said. "The day 
after I called to join, I was meeting with a person who is my 10th cousin." 
</P>
<P>
Formed two years ago by four Orange County residents, the Hispanic Family 
History Researchers now has a 300-member mailing list. Strictly volunteer, the 
group shares a "common passion for genealogy," Chavez Bent said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to quarterly meetings and special interest workshops, the group 
conducts its research at the Bolsa Family History Library at the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Garden Grove Stake in Westminster. There, 
the group has access to the Mormon Church's extensive microfilm and microfiche 
family history data bank. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoons, from 1 to 5 p.m., Lozano-Holtzman and her assistant, 
Ophelia Marquez, along with other volunteers from the Hispanic Family History 
Researchers, help fellow Latinos trace their ancestral roots. "We want to reach 
out to more Hispanics that want to do research, and think they can't do it," 
Chavez Bent said. "We know it can be done because we've done it." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the group's members specialize in researching specific Latino lines in 
a variety of Spanish-speaking countries, including Mexico, Spain, Puerto Rico, 
Cuba, Guatemala, Peru and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
When Chavez Bent was compiling her family history, her husband Jerry's aunt 
sent a complete family genealogy tracing the Bent line back to the American 
Revolution. Chavez Bent finds it interesting that her three children, Eric 
Matthew Bent, Roxane Louise Crawford and Denise Margarita Harro, have lineages 
going back to both the first Anglo and Latino colonizers in America. "Because 
of their dad, my daughters qualify to become members of the Daughters of the 
American Revolution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez Bent is still trying to fill the missing gaps in her four-century family 
tree, focusing on completing the first nine generations. She pointed on the 
15-generation pedigree chart to an empty space in the fifth generation. "If you 
can imagine, I have a total blank up here where my great-grandfather is. I 
don't know who his parents are." 
</P>
<P>
It's possible that information about that ancestor may be sequestered in a 
church in New Mexico, she said. "Some of the records are still held in 
individual churches, and they've been there since the 1700s. We don't have any 
access at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm afraid of is that someday a really eager-beaver cleaning woman is 
going to be out there straightening up the rectory, and she's going to dump the 
books, and those family members will be lost forever." 
</P>
<P>
The sixth annual Hispanic Family History Seminar will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m. today at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana. Cost is $17 for advance 
tickets, $20 at the door. For further information, contact the Bowers Museum at

JOSEPH N. BELL: ONE LITTLE DACHSHUND MANAGES TO THROW ONE BIG SCARE INTO A 
FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent Saturday night, we got home late from an Angels game. It was the 
night Dante Bichette unloaded a three-run homer in the 12th inning, and we 
happily stuck it out to the end. My wife and I were still high when we hit our 
driveway at midnight and said good night to the friends who had gone with us. 
</P>
<P>
Our customary practice when we get home late at night is to rap on our garage 
door to tell our miniature dachshund, Coco, who is barking an excited greeting 
from inside, that it's us. But on this night there was no greeting. The silence 
was suddenly oppressive. And ominous. 
</P>
<P>
We went through the house and opened the back door, where she usually comes 
tearing through and races around the house, forgetting her irritation that we 
abandoned her in the joy that we're back. On this night, she wasn't at the 
door. Nor did she respond when we called her. 
</P>
<P>
I grabbed a flashlight, and my wife and I went looking; we didn't talk. There 
was disturbing evidence in the garage of a very sick dog -- but no Coco. As we 
searched the back yard, we found a darkish pool of blood. We have possums that 
Coco -- perpetually playing out her fantasy of reckless hunter -- goes into 
small places after. I've worried that one of them, cornered, would do her in. I 
flashed on that as we searched the yard. 
</P>
<P>
Then she emerged from the darkest, deepest corner of the yard, dragging her 
way, looking like warmed-over death. There were no wounds on her, so it was 
clear the problem was internal. 
</P>
<P>
We called our vet and got a recorded referral number of a pet emergency 
hospital in Fountain Valley. So we wrapped Coco in towels and entered a world 
neither of us had ever experienced before: the world of grievously sick and 
wounded pets -- on a weekend, when most veterinary hospitals are closed. 
</P>
<P>
I had experienced this scene in passing with my oldest daughter, who has a 
retinue of animals in her household. I've driven with her to the vets several 
times on various errands of mercy. But the people in the waiting room never 
registered on me because I wasn't involved. It all seemed rather silly -- this 
fawning over pets -- and I was always impatient to get away. Besides, it never 
happened in the middle of the night at an emergency clinic. 
</P>
<P>
It was just like the emergency room at a people hospital. Several pet owners -- 
an older man who had obviously dressed hurriedly and was looking sightlessly at 
a magazine whose pages he didn't turn, a young woman who kept taking off her 
shoes and putting them on, a family of mom, dad and a teen-age son crying 
together -- were hanging out in the waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
While my wife held Coco, I had to fill out multiple forms. I remember one 
question in particular, because it didn't give me pause until later. I had to 
choose between 1) setting a fixed amount beyond what they presumably wouldn't 
go on providing care for Coco, or 2) indicate that I wanted them to do whatever 
was necessary to save her life and restore her -- and hang the cost. This is 
rather like being asked, at a moment of crisis, what a life you love is worth 
to you -- the ultimate gun at the head. The answer, of course, has to be that 
it is priceless, which doesn't translate to dollars and cents until the crisis 
has passed, one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I signed everything they pushed at me, then -- with Coco shaking -- an 
attendant ushered us into an examination room. The shaking reminded me 
graphically of a wonderful wirehair terrier I owned when I was 16. He had been 
poisoned by a neighbor -- we could never prove who did it, but we knew from the 
autopsy that he was poisoned -- and when I found him, he was shaking just as 
Coco was shaking. The terrier died on the way to the vet, and I thought about 
that a lot during our drive to Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the examination room, Coco shook on my wife's lap, and I paced as we awaited 
the doctor. She turned out to be a gentle and remarkably young woman who told 
us that Coco was very sick but that she couldn't offer an accurate diagnosis 
until she took some blood tests. She suggested we go home and said she would 
call us as soon as she knew. 
</P>
<P>
We did, wrapped in our own thoughts. I slept fitfully, and I don't think my 
wife slept at all until the doctor called about 4:30 in the morning. Coco, it 
turned out, had the lesser of two possible diseases. She had lost a lot of 
blood and needed to be fed intravenously to rebuild her strength. The prognosis 
was good, but she needed to be observed and cared for at the hospital for 
several days, at least. 
</P>
<P>
My stepson had been away for the weekend, and when he returned Sunday and 
learned about Coco, he cried very hard, just as I had seen the young man in the 
waiting room crying. Our reassurances didn't mollify him until he went to visit 
Coco and got a feeble tail wag as a sign of recognition. Then he was all right; 
he knew she would be coming home. 
</P>
<P>
Coco stayed at the emergency clinic until Monday, then we transferred her to 
our own vet, who loves her dearly. She's home now, beginning to eat normally -- 
which means anything she can get, although we give her nothing but "scientific 
food" -- chase her old enemies, the neighborhood cats, rip through the house 
sliding on the hardwood floors, and sniff out the possums that hang out in our 
back yard. We still don't know what happened; our vet can only surmise that 
Coco ate something that would probably have been lethal had we not been able to 
get her immediate care. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency bill was prodigious, but so was the care she received. It was 
gentle, loving and efficient -- and I know that staffing an emergency clinic 
round-the-clock on weekends is expensive. But I couldn't help wondering what 
someone who lacked our resources (we had to pay a sizable amount up front) but 
loved their pet as much as we would do in such an emergency. Where could they 
turn? 
</P>
<P>
The other thing I learned -- a little grudgingly, perhaps -- is how much I care 
about this tiny wharf rat of a dachshund who has captured our household. 
Although I know she won't, I just hope to hell she watches what she eats from 
now on -- and stays out of possum dens. I can't put in very many more weekends 
like that one.

JAYWALKING SUSPECT HELD IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transient sought in the slaying of a Glendale gardener was arrested in Studio 
City after he jaywalked in front of two officers on the lookout for errant 
pedestrians, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers Ken Green and Ann McGrew noticed that a jaywalker 
they intended to ticket at Vineland venue and Ventura Boulevard Thursday 
matched the composite drawing of a homicide suspect shown at their morning roll 
call, said Los Angeles Police Capt. Dan Watson. 
</P>
<P>
The jaywalker, Christopher Pinedo, 28, was jailed in connection with the April 
5 slaying of Jimmy Noda, 67. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran across the street against the 'Don't Walk' sign, and that's what got 
him arrested," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said he recently told officers to crack down on jaywalkers because of a 
rash of traffic accidents in the area involving pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Police Lt. Roger Brown said his department will ask the district 
attorney's office Monday to charge Pinedo in the death of Noda, who was found 
strangled in his Wilson Avenue home in Glendale. He said Pinedo, described as a 
homeless day laborer, is being held without bail in Los Angeles County Jail, 
pending an arraignment next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We got lucky," Brown said of the events leading to Pinedo's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said his department had just begun circulating the composite drawing to 
area police and hospitals when a North Hollywood officer realized that it 
resembled a transient he had questioned last week concerning a robbery. He told 
fellow officers that the transient was frequently seen near Ventura and 
Vineland. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Green and McGrew recalled that report when the jaywalker caught 
their attention at the intersection, and they matched him to the drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Glendale police have linked Pinedo to the Noda homicide scene 
through physical evidence, but he declined to elaborate. Brown said Noda and 
Pinedo had no family or business ties. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't any prior relationship," he said. "We think they just met that 
night. They ended up at Jimmy's house, and that's where the murder occurred." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood police were called April 5 after a Toyota Camry was discovered 
at a restaurant near Sherman Way and Coldwater Canyon 
</P>
<P>
Avenue with an open door and trunk and fresh blood inside. The car was 
registered to Noda. Glendale police officers then found the door ajar at Noda's 
home and the gardener's body in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said investigators believe that Noda was killed by someone that he had 
admitted to the home. He said they believe the killer was cut during a struggle 
with Noda and fled in the gardener's car. 
</P>
<P>
After the slaying was discovered, a North Hollywood police officer recalled 
that he had questioned a man with a fresh cut on his right hand shortly before 
the blood-stained car was found. 
</P>
<P>
That officer -- and a witness who had seen the suspect at the restaurant -- 
helped a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department artist prepare the composite drawing 
that was shown during Thursday's roll-call meeting.

Michael Jordan scored 38 points, Scottie Pippen had a triple-double and the 
Chicago Bulls used a 13-2 fourth-quarter run to defeat Milwaukee, 111-97, 
Friday night in the opener of their first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bulls grabbed the lead for good midway through the second quarter, 
the Bucks trailed only 83-80 early in the fourth period before Chicago took 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan converted a three-point play to start the decisive 13-2 run, and Ed 
Nealy and Stacy King added three points each as the Bulls pulled away to a 
96-82 advantage with 6:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
Pippen finished with 17 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for Chicago, and 
Horace Grant scored 19 points for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Pierce led the Bucks with 28 points and Alvin Robertson scored 22. 
</P>
<P>
There were eight lead changes and four ties in the first quarter, with the 
Bulls holding the biggest margin at 15-10. The period ended with Milwaukee 
holding a 27-26 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
There were seven more lead changes early in the second quarter before Grant 
broke a 36-36 tie to put the Bulls ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls gradually extended the margin to 51-43 with 2:19 left in the half, 
but the Bucks scored the next six points, and the half ended with Chicago ahead 
54-52. 
</P>
<P>
With Bill Cartwright scoring six points, the Bulls outscored Milwaukee 13-5 at 
the start of the second half for a 67-57 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of three 10-point leads for the Bulls, but Pierce scored 11 
points in the quarter, including a closing three-point play, to make it 79-74 
going into the final quarter.

MAN IN DNA CASE GETS 49-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-year-old Los Angeles man who last month became the first person in Los 
Angeles County to be convicted in a case built on DNA evidence was sentenced 
Friday to 49 years in prison for sexually assaulting two women. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge James A. Coleman imposed the sentence on Henry 
Wilds, saying Wilds exhibited a high degree of "cruelty, viciousness and 
callousness." 
</P>
<P>
In March, after a trial that featured two months of complicated scientific 
testimony, a jury convicted Wilds of 10 counts of rape, robbery, forcible oral 
copulation and burglary in connection with three separate attacks on women in 
North Hollywood. Wilds wore a mask for two of the attacks, making 
identification difficult. Although the property of one victim was found in 
Wilds' apartment, several jurors said they could not have found Wilds guilty of 
anything but burglary without the DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, who prosecuted Wilds, asked Coleman to sentence 
Wilds to 77 years in prison, saying he "is a dangerous and violent man and a 
true threat to our community." 
</P>
<P>
She cited a string of assault and robbery convictions against Wilds that date 
back to 1971. Wilds' victims have continued to suffer emotional trauma since 
the attacks, Kahn said. One rape victim became pregnant as a result of the 
assault and underwent an abortion, Kahn said. The third victim suffered a 
miscarriage a few days after the burglary, the prosecutor added. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilds' attorney, Ralph J. Novotney, argued that Wilds should receive only a 
30-year sentence because he did not stab or beat the victims "or impose any 
terrorism over and above" what was necessary to assault them. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman took the middle ground after noting that Wilds, a large man, preyed 
upon "small, defenseless women" and "engaged in a pattern of violent conduct 
that poses a danger to society." 
</P>
<P>
With credit for time served and good behavior, Wilds could be released from 
prison in 24 years, said Novotney, who said he would appeal the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Developed four years ago in Great Britain, DNA testing is expected by some to 
become as important a forensic technique as fingerprinting. Others say the 
technique is unreliable because of flaws in the scientific procedures, 
statistics and the standards of laboratories that do the work. 
</P>
<P>
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in all human cells, including sperm, 
blood and hair. Experts say the genetic makeup of tissue can be translated into 
patterns that resemble supermarket bar codes. Except for identical twins, no 
two people have the same DNA pattern experts claim. 
</P>
<P>
In so-called genetic fingerprinting, DNA samples taken from a crime scene are 
analyzed and compared to DNA samples take from a suspect's blood. 
</P>
<P>
Wilds was convicted of assaulting and robbing a 30-year-old woman in December, 
1986, in the underground garage of her apartment building, and of a nearly 
identical attack on a 27-year-old woman in February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by Los Angeles police two months later, after allegedly 
following a 28-year-old woman into the underground parking lot of her apartment 
building. Seeing Wilds, the woman became suspicious and fled in her car. She 
flagged down police, who arrested Wilds on a bicycle and found a kitchen knife 
in nearby bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Over defense objections, prosecutors obtained a court order to compare the DNA 
coding in samples of Wilds' blood to that of sperm found after the assaults. 
Maryland-based Cellmark Diagnostics, which performed the test, said there was 
an infinitesimal chance that the sperm samples were not those of Wilds. 
</P>
<P>
The two-month trial followed an even more lengthy hearing to determine whether 
DNA evidence is reliable enough and respected enough in the scientific 
community to be admissible as evidence under California law. 
</P>
<P>
In September, as 35-year-old Ventura woman became the first person in 
California to be convicted because of genetic evidence. Prosecutors used DNA 
patterns in 15 strands of hair as evidence that the woman stabbed a man to 
death at a Ventura hamburger stand. Although appeals are pending, no higher 
court has yet ruled on the technique's admissibility.

ON CAMPUS: AGRICULTURE PROGRAM TO BE REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by campus correspondents and Times staff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Community College District Chancellor Donald Phelps, responding to 
growing criticism of the Pierce College agriculture program, has asked for a 
review of the program's curriculum to determine whether it is out of step with 
the needs of the area's agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said he didn't want to eliminate farm classes completely, but at a 
recent meeting with Pierce faculty he mentioned that other colleges have leased 
excess land to cities and private groups for uses that have included municipal 
facilities and a privately owned hotel. The farm at Pierce occupies about 250 
acres of the 400 acres on the Woodland Hills campus. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's agriculture program has become increasingly controversial in recent 
years as its enrollment has fallen. The program has about 1,300 students, about 
half of the number it had in 1982, and officials have said that the program 
would have to attract at least 700 additional students to become viable. 
Classes directly connected with the farm enroll about 240 students. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal criticized the agriculture program 
as an example of how community colleges are doing a poor job of preparing the 
nation's future work force. 
</P>
<P>
"Pierce Community College is still teaching courses in agriculture and cattle 
and sheep production, even though it serves a bustling urban area where any 
sheep unwise enough to venture forth are likely to wind up as flattened fauna 
on the freeways," the newspaper article said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the article, Phelps said: "If the article is correct, we need to 
respond to it by correcting the curriculum of the Agriculture Department so 
that we are teaching compatible classes with the agriculture industry." 
</P>
<P>
He was also critical of the $100,000 the college spends annually to water the 
farm. "That's pretty doggone expensive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment is particularly low in the agriculture department's classes on large 
animals. Most college academic departments seek to enroll about 35 students per 
class, but the large-animal classes at Pierce this spring average only nine 
students per class. Norlund said the college spends about $1 million, or about 
$5,000 per student a year, on the large-animal program. 
</P>
<P>
Horse classes, which have always been popular, are not included in those 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Mick Sears, who chairs the Agriculture Department, agreed that "what was 
important 30 years ago is obviously not as important now." 
</P>
<P>
However, he defended the agriculture program. "We are looking to teach classes 
that are relevant to the future," Sears said.

ON CAMPUS: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE; 
</P>
<P>
18 STUDENTS DESIGNING MARS PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Compiled by campus correspondents and Times staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
Eighteen Cal State Northridge seniors are aiming high and designing a 
first-of-its-kind space probe that may someday help scientists analyze the 
atmosphere of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The students' Project Ares, in conjunction with the University Space Research 
Assn. and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is a three-year 
effort to design a craft capable of sustained flight in the Martian atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Project Director Neil Rubin, senior engineering major, said the purpose of the 
probe is to enable scientists to conduct a detailed survey of Mars in 
preparation for a possible visit to the planet by astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
When complete, the probe will resemble a sleek, lightweight plane with a 
40-foot wingspan. The probe will be powered by lightweight batteries and 
wing-mounted solar panels. A specially designed propeller will pull the plane 
through the thin, carbon dioxide Martian atmosphere. The collapsible craft is 
to be lifted into orbit by a Titan missile. 
</P>
<P>
The students' design and testing work is reviewed by NASA engineers. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty members heading the project are Melvin Epstein, a professor of 
mechanical engineering, and Timothy Fox, who chairs the CSUN mechanical 
engineering department. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which only seniors are eligible to work on, will be continued by a

2 KILLED AFTER CAR PLUNGES OFF FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were killed Friday when their speeding Corvette crashed through a 
concrete barrier on an elevated section of the Golden State Freeway and 
plummeted 100 feet to a field below, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The car shot off of there like a rocket," CHP Officer Dave Grajeda said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 2:40 a.m. on the curving transition road from the 
northbound Golden State Freeway to the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The car flew out 90 feet and then down 100," Grajeda said. "Both occupants 
weren't wearing seat belts and were ejected. The passenger landed on top of the 
driver and the car landed on top of them." 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Corvette was driven by a 37-year-old Los Angeles man whose name was 
not released pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
The driver died shortly after the accident at Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger, a 19-year-old Pacoima man, died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Grajeda said there were no witnesses to the accident but the investigation 
showed that the car was going faster than 100 m.p.h. when the driver attempted 
to take the right-hand curve onto the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"He lost control and crashed through the barrier," Grajeda said. 
</P>
<P>
Grajeda said there were no indications that the accident was a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
He said investigators will have to await autopsy results to determine if the 
driver had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't know the cause, other than speed," he said.
