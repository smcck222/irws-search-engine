ROGERS WON'T RETURN TO COUNTRY DAY SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>

SEVERANCE

<P>
In their first public appearance since the March 10 bombing of their van on a 
La Jolla street, Navy Capt. Will Rogers III and his wife, Sharon, said Friday 
that she will not return to her fourth-grade teaching position at La Jolla 
Country Day School. 
</P>
<P>
The Rogerses, speaking at a news conference, sharply denounced the exclusive, 
private school for bowing to what apparently was an act of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Under a severance agreement, Sharon Rogers, who taught 12 years at the school, 
will receive a lump sum of $135,000, plus $5,000 for her legal fees, and will 
not return to the campus, where school officials believe her presence would 
pose a risk to students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI has been investigating the bombing as a possible reprisal for Capt. 
Rogers' order to shoot down an Iranian passenger jet that neared his ship, the 
guided missile cruiser Vincennes, in the Persian Gulf last summer. All 290 
people aboard the plane were killed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Simply Just Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past weeks, I have felt many different emotions, but today I am 
simply just disappointed," said Sharon Rogers, fighting back tears. "More 
disappointed than I can possibly express. I will miss my relationship with the 
school. But most of all I will miss my students and their courageous and 
thoughtful parents." 
</P>
<P>
Both Capt. Rogers and his wife said they believe the van bombing was an act of 
terrorism. Mrs. Rogers added that the school, by barring her from campus, was 
sending out a message that it was bowing to terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sad for our country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Fipp, president of the school's board of trustees, said in a letter 
Friday to the school's parents and staffers that safety was the prime reason 
for the school's decision that Mrs. Rogers not return to teach her 
fourth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
"The school believed and continues to believe that Sharon's presence on campus 
would pose an unreasonable risk to the children at the school," Fipp said. "The 
school believes that the presence of the 24-hour federal protection now being 
offered to Sharon is evidence of the risks involved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Action Criticized 
</P>
<P>
The school, with 700 students and 67 teachers, has been the subject of intense 
criticism, both in San Diego and across the country -- including a pointed 
comment from the White House -- in the weeks since the attack. 
</P>
<P>
One of the toughest questions facing the school administration was why it moved 
so quickly to remove Sharon Rogers from the faculty, without waiting to see 
whether the FBI determines that the bombing was indeed a terrorist act. 
</P>
<P>
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, other than confirming that the 
explosive device was a pipe bomb, have declined to reveal the status of their 
continuing probe. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers was not injured in the van blast. Feeling a jolt and thinking 
that her van had been hit from behind, she had jumped from the van moments 
before it was engulfed in flames. But she described that incident as a 
"life-altering event," highlighted by the ensuing battle over whether she would 
be allowed to return to her job. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers and her husband were escorted to the press conference at a 
Mission Valley hotel by a large contingent of security officials from the Naval 
Investigative Service. She wore a red dress and he wore a blue blazer and red 
slacks. When they sat down before the microphones, the security officers posted 
themselves at both entrances to the room and in the parking lot as well. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers maintained that the school would be secure with her there because 
of the added NIS protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they would be very safe with the NIS agents there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy M. Burns, the school's headmaster who came under sharp criticism from 
some parents and teachers over his handling of the Rogers affair, could not be 
reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Roth, a Pasadena public relations specialist hired by the school, said 
the 18-member board's vote Friday morning "was not unanimous but overwhelmingly 
in favor of approval" of the decision to sever ties with Sharon Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the headmaster normally approves or rejects teaching contracts 
without board action. 
</P>
<P>
"But this was not a contract issue," Roth said. "This was a legal issue, and 
it's appropriate for the board to take up matters of legal consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the board agreed to pay her $135,000, when her current contract is 
for $32,400 annually, Roth said: 
</P>
<P>
"We want to avoid a legal action. Instead of paying legal fees (from a 
lawsuit), we believe it is more appropriate to provide Sharon with this 
compensation." 
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, the school told Mrs. Rogers not to return to the campus for 
the rest of this school year. Faced with criticism for making her a victim a 
second time, the school offered her two contract options for the school year 
beginning in September. Both were contingent on being assured that safety 
concerns could be met. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers submitted a counterproposal, asking for $200,000 over five years 
if she were prevented from returning to school because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Rogers said he is disappointed in the way the school treated his wife. 
But he said he is proud of the way she held up after suffering the horror of 
having a terrorist "light a fireball under her van." 
</P>
<P>
"She's a lady of iron," he said, placing his arm around her shoulders whenever 
she choked back tears. "There's a lot of grit here." 
</P>
<P>
Both Sharon Rogers and her husband said they are convinced that the bombing was 
a terrorist strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that someone in the dead of night put a bomb on the undercarriage of 
my van, and, whoever that person was, is a terrorist," Sharon Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband added: "I think they will run aground, and they will be brought to 
justice. Whether it's a state-sponsored act or an individual act or a 
disgruntled sailor, whatever it will be, it will all come to light. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it's a high school kid experimenting with a PVC bomb or the 
Revolutionary Guard, the problem is there. It's terrorism, no matter how you 
cut it." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he had fully expected the school to welcome her back. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he sympathizes with his wife for the intense media and community 
scrutiny she has faced. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the misfortune of being at the center of my 15 minutes of fame earlier," 
he said, referring to his decision to shoot down the Iranian plane. 
</P>
<P>
"But time does heal a lot of things. And you take a step at a time. So I was 
very disappointed when the reaction on the part of the school occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mrs. Rogers said recent events have dramatically changed her life, she 
said she plans to begin seeking work at another school in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to start pounding the pavement next week," she said. "I'm going to 
update my resume and hit the bricks on Monday."

ROY L. WILLIAMS; TEAMSTER CHIEF SPENT TIME IN PRISON 
</P>

Former Teamsters Union president Roy Lee Williams, who served three years in 
prison for bribery and acknowledged that his union was under the influence of 
organized crime, died Friday at his farm home here. He was 74, and suffered 
from emphysema and heart ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a protege of former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who with Dave 
Beck was the third Teamsters leader in 25 years to be imprisoned, was 
international president of the union from 1981 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
He was forced to resign after he and four co-defendants were convicted in 
December, 1982, of trying to bribe former U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon of Nevada to 
influence trucking deregulation. Cannon was not charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Williams served three years of a 10-year sentence before he was released from 
federal prison in September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctor Summoned 
</P>
<P>
A family spokesman said a doctor was called to the Williams house about 70 
miles southeast of Kansas City about 5 a.m. when Williams experienced trouble 
breathing. The spokesman said Williams did not want to go to the hospital at 
that time and went back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mark Vogt said he returned to the house with paramedics after Williams 
became acutely ill but he could not be revived. Williams died of complications 
of emphysema, Vogt said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his career with the Teamsters, Williams had connections with 
individuals considered by law enforcement officials to be tied to organized 
crime, including Allen Dorfman, a Chicago insurance executive who was convicted 
with Williams. Dorfman was gunned down gangland-style outside a suburban 
Chicago restaurant Jan. 20, 1983, while appealing his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Teamster headquarters in Washington had no immediate comment Friday on 
Williams' death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Kind Words 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, William J. McCarthy, president of the Teamsters, had no 
kind words for either Williams or Jackie Presser, Williams successor, when he 
testified before Congress: "One was a cheat and one was a liar and both were 
mixed up with La Cosa Nostra by their own admissions. I didn't care for either 
one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams claimed that he was set up in the attempted bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview early this year, Williams said: "I am still just an old truck 
driver at heart. It's over now and I am glad of it. I still have to meet my 
maker. But I can still say I didn't do nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Williams testified at a casino money-skimming trial in 
Kansas City that he had received payments from Nick Civella, the late Kansas 
City crime boss, for helping mob figures obtain a $60-million loan from a union 
pension fund. Williams said in an interview later that he did so only after his 
family was threatened and after Hoffa advised him to do it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Payoffs 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, which he gave in an attempt to have his sentence reduced, 
Williams said he received payoffs of $1,500 a month from Civella for seven 
years when he was a local labor leader. He said Civella played a key role in 
his election to the union's international presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also testified by videotape in a federal court trial in New York 
against mob figures accused of fixing his election as Teamsters president, and 
that of Presser, who died last July. Three co-defendants were acquitted of that 
charge in May, 1988, but convicted of unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is survived by two daughters and a grandson.

CLYDE (GERRY) GERONIMI; ANIMATOR WON 2 OSCARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clyde (Gerry) Geronimi, who began with the Walt Disney Studios in 1931 
animating Mickey Mouse, Pluto and Silly Symphony cartoons and whose 28-career 
extended into Academy Award-winning directorships of some of Disney's 
best-known feature films, died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He was 87 and died in his Newport Beach home, where he lived after he retired. 
</P>
<P>
Geronimi was an experienced animator before joining Disney, having traced 
drawings of comic characters and transferred them to film for the old Hearst 
studios, whose early cartoon characters included "The Katzenjammer Kids." (A 
co-worker at Hearst in 1918 was Walter Lantz, who subsequently created Woody 
Woodpecker and other cartoon classics. Lantz handed Geronimi his Annie Award 
when the Italian-born Geronimi was honored by the Hollywood chapter of the 
International Animation Society in 1977.) 
</P>
<P>
Geronimi joined Disney in 1931 and helped animate more than 50 of the studio's 
early cartoons. He became a director in 1938, and won his first Oscar in 1939 
for "The Ugly Duckling," a short. His second Academy Award came in 1942 for 
"Lend a Paw," another short. 
</P>
<P>
As a sequence, or segment, director, Geronimi's credits for Disney included 
"Three Caballeros," "The Adventures of Ichabod &amp; Mr. Toad," "Cinderella," 
"Peter Pan," "Sleeping Beauty," for which he was supervising director, and "101 
Dalmations." 
</P>
<P>
He also directed several specials for Disney on television. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by two sons, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: TAKING IRA PAYOUTS CAN BE JUGGLING ACT 
</P>

QUESTION: I will turn age 70 1/2 this year, and I understand that I must begin 
taking minimum distributions from my individual retirement accounts. However, 
most of the assets in these accounts are large ($100,000) Treasury bills, 
government-backed mortgage securities and interests in real estate 
partnerships. These assets do not liquidate easily in small annual increments, 
and I don't want to sell a whole $100,000 Treasury note just to take a minimum 
distribution and then be liable for taxes on the entire amount. Surely, there 
must be a way of dealing with such assets. -- R. W. P. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You're right, there are ways of dealing with your situation. According 
to Ellen Marshall, an attorney with the Costa Mesa office of the Morrison &amp; 
Foerster law firm, you have at least two alternatives to completely liquidating 
your assets in order to take the minimum required distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall suggests that you explore the possibility of re-registering into your 
own name each year a portion of your IRA assets that corresponds to the minimum 
required distribution. Under this strategy you are not liquidating anything, 
just transferring legal ownership from your IRA to your personal account. Of 
course, you would pay the required taxes on this distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Another solution would be to take the full amount of your required distribution 
from just one of your IRA accounts or investments, rather than tap each account 
for its proportionate share. This way, you would have to handle only a single 
account instead of your full IRA portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
You would be wise to consult a business attorney for advice on whether you can 
re-register your share of the real estate partnerships and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to report a tax loss on stock I purchased many years ago and 
kept in my brokerage account. This stock has not been quoted for years and my 
broker cannot give me any information about the current status of the company. 
I have tried on my own, but with no luck. In order to take the loss, the 
Internal Revenue Service says I need proof that the company is out of business. 
What can I do? -- G. P. 
</P>
<P>
A: Frankly, it's shocking that your broker is so unwilling to tap into the vast 
resources he has available though his company's nationwide operations. The 
truth is that the brokerage has the information you need. 
</P>
<P>
You can pursue the matter through the chain of command at the brokerage by 
writing to either the manager of the local office or the regional director. Be 
sure your letter includes all the pertinent information -- company name, when 
you purchased the shares and the fact that you've held the shares in your 
brokerage account for several years. This strategy should produce the desired 
results. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you just want to get the matter over with, contact Prudential 
American Securities, a stock research outfit that will do the job for you for 
$28. Send a check for that amount along with the pertinent information about 
the research you want done to Prudential American Securities, 747 E. Green St., 
Suite 100, Pasadena, Calif. 91101. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I are planning to retire next year. We own our current home free 
and clear. We also own a rental house. We are now considering moving into the 
rental unit because it is smaller and better suits our needs. What would the 
tax consequences of this move be? -- B. A. 
</P>
<P>
A: Two important facts were not supplied: How recently the rental house was 
purchased and your age. Still, we can answer your question. 
</P>
<P>
When you purchased the rental is important because, if you bought it less than 
two years before the sale of the old house, the rental can qualify as a 
"replacement dwelling." If you are allowed to treat your rental as a 
replacement house, then the tax code allows you to defer paying taxes on some 
or all of the profits you receive when you sell your original house. You can 
defer taxation on the entire gain if the rental house cost as much as, or more 
than, the selling price of your original house. 
</P>
<P>
For example, let's say you purchased your original home for $25,000 and you 
sell it for $200,000. Your gain is $175,000. (For the sake of simplicity, let's 
leave out of the equation any improvements, closing costs, real estate agent 
fees and other associated costs.) Let's assume that the rental house cost 
$100,000 and you bought it one year ago. If you move into the rental, you can 
defer taxation on $100,000 of the $175,000 gain and would be liable for taxes 
only on $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you purchased the rental more than two years before selling your 
original house, it does not qualify as a replacement dwelling and you would not 
be able to defer taxes on any part of your $175,000 profit if you move into it. 
</P>
<P>
The second factor to consider is age. If either you or your wife is over age 
55, you are allowed to invoke a one-time exclusion from taxation of $125,000 of 
profits from the sale of your principal residence. If you are eligible to use 
the exclusion and your rental property does not qualify as a replacement 
dwelling, you might consider using this exemption. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the rental qualifies as a replacement house, you have a choice: 
Apply the one-time exclusion to the taxable $75,000 of your gain -- and waste 
$50,000 of the exemption that you cannot use in this transaction -- or save the 
entire $125,000 exclusion until the year the rental is sold and pay taxes on 
the $75,000 gain. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's column discussing divorce-related financial planning contained an 
incorrect telephone number for the Society of CPA Financial Planners. The 
correct number is (800) 445-7526. The society's executive director, John C. 
Bish, says the group makes referrals on all financial planning matters to its 
membership, which includes only for-fee certified public accountants who are 
also financial planners.

The stock market showed little change in slackened trading Friday, bogging down 
after Thursday's rally to new post-crash highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials slipped 0.19 to 2,418.80, finishing the 
week with a net gain of 9.34 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing and declining issues ran about even in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 738 up, 715 down and 502 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 158.39 million shares, down from 
191.17 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
188.50 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Friday morning that the index of leading 
economic indicators fell 0.7% in March, following a 0.3% decline the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figure slightly exceeded the consensus estimate on Wall Street, and 
provided new evidence of the kind of slowing in business activity that many 
investors have been hoping for. Interest rates fell in the credit markets on 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the response in the stock market was muted, however, by some 
misgivings about the potential implications of the figures for corporate 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, brokers said traders were leery of chasing after a rally that has 
proceeded for more than a month with few interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Dow index finished April with a gain of 155.18 points. For 
the first four months of 1989, the average is up 250.23 points, or 11.54%. 
</P>
<P>
Among individual issues in Friday's trading, Ford Motor dropped 1/8 to 47 3/4 
in active trading. On Thursday, the company reported higher first-quarter 
profits, but said its earnings for the full year might not equal the record 
total reported for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the blue chip sector, General Electric rose 1/4 to 48 7/8, 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped 1/4 to 34 7/8, Exxon lost 1/8 to 43 
1/8 and USX was down 3/8 at 34 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Rite Aid fell 1 7/8 to 34 3/4. Ohio authorities arrested the company's 
president on bribery charges Thursday. In a statement Friday, Rite Aid called 
the charge "totally without merit." 
</P>
<P>
Precious metals issues were weak as the price of gold fell $5.40 an ounce to 
$377.90 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. ASA Ltd. dropped 3/4 to 41 3/8; 
Battle Mountain Gold lost 3/8 to 13 3/8 and Freeport-McMoRan Gold dipped 1/2 to 
11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks climbed to a record for the third straight day, with investors 
relieved that pressure on Japan to boost interest rates appeared to have 
subsided for the time being, brokers said.

The key Nikkei index gained 212.52 points, or 0.63%, to close at 33,713.35. But 
buyers thinned in the afternoon ahead of the weekend and three days of Japanese 
holidays at the end of next week.

In London, an easier Wall Street opening and a bout of profit taking kept 
British shares mixed. The stock exchange drifted to a dull close ahead of the 
long May Day weekend. The 100-share Financial Times index ended 2.3 points 
higher at 2,118, a rise of 47 points for the week.

Bond prices fell despite economic statistics indicating that the economy is 
cooling and interest rates may ease. 
</P>
<P>
The credit market's bellwether 30-year Treasury issue was down 1/8 point, or 
$1.25 for every $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, 
rose to 8.92% from 8.90% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
securities were down from 1/16 point to 5/32 point, intermediate governments 
fell 3/32 point to 7/32 point and long-term maturities slumped from 1/8 point 
to 3/16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.

<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a

<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the

'BILL W.' AND AA MAKE THE ROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Times Television Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rare major actor who works in both television and theatrical movies, James 
Woods is almost as prolific as he is proficient. 
</P>
<P>
Here he is this time tearing up the small screen as Bill Wilson, co-founder 
(with Dr. Bob Smith) of Alcoholics Anonymous, in the ABC movie "My Name Is Bill 
W." at 9 p.m. Sunday on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
</P>
<P>
Explosive and unpredictable, Woods is utterly convincing in this 
drunk's-eye-view of the world from the bottoms up, a coughing, choking, 
sputtering, red-eyed wreck of a man who is able to rebound from the gutter only 
after he begins openly commiserating with fellow alcoholics. Hence, AA. 
</P>
<P>
And JoBeth Williams is sterling as Bill's suffering wife, Lois, who was 
instrumental in starting Al-Anon, the support group for families of habitual 
drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
Both, however, are sabotaged by butchered editing and a final 20 minutes so 
bungled that recommending this movie, produced and directed by Daniel Petrie, 
becomes a close call. 
</P>
<P>
The story is told in flashback, with Bill emerging from service in World War I 
as a dynamic young entrepreneur with big ambition and talent, but an even 
bigger problem -- drinking. He rides high on the stock market, only to go down 
in the 1929 crash. As an out-of-control lush who had made his wife miserable, 
however, he had been descending for years. 
</P>
<P>
William G. Borchert's script doesn't push Bill too fast. Wheezing and 
self-deluding, Bill slides toward rock bottom ever so gradually so that you can 
feel him dying inside. Even after he acknowledges his problem, the ugly, 
self-destructive boozer in him fades just as slowly. Rationally and calmly he 
analyzes his alcoholism and the guilt feelings it produces, then adds: "But in 
spite of all that, what I want right now more than anything else is another 
drink." 
</P>
<P>
The irony of Bill Wilson's story is that his ultimate sobriety becomes a wedge 
that continues to distance him from Lois, for only in spiritual collaboration 
with another alcoholic (played by James Garner, Woods' co-star in "The 
Promise") does Bill attain renewal and the impetus to form AA. 
</P>
<P>
The good marks end here. 
</P>
<P>
Later, there's a price to be paid on the cutting room floor for Bill's unrushed 
early evolution. Unlike most TV movies, which have to be padded to fill 
oversized time slots, "My Name Is Bill W." has the look of a deformed 
three-hour story that's been clumsily amputated at the knees to make it fit 
into two hours of air time. The narrative is so unsmooth and awkwardly episodic 
in parts that you'd think it was edited with the jagged edge of a broken 
whiskey bottle. And the final portion is so stumpy -- with crucial parts of the 
story seemingly hacked off arbitrarily -- that nothing seems to make sense. 
</P>
<P>
Bill recovers, but the movie about him ends up crippled and debilitated.

THE CONTROVERSY OVER BLACKS AND SPORTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Rosenberg's column is offensive. He states: "In sport after sport, blacks are 
just plain better athletes than whites. No contest. Maybe it's in the genes." 
</P>
<P>
To promote any idea of superiority regarding race, class or ethnicity is to 
keep company with the Hitlers of history.

FACES . . .: OVERCOMING INSECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelly McGillis has played mostly strong, stalwart characters, women of 
conviction and great self-confidence. You can't appreciate the amount of acting 
she does in these roles until you hear her describe herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm highly insecure and not very social," McGillis says. "I don't feel very 
important in the whole of life." 
</P>
<P>
In her current release, "Winter People," a Depression-era love story set in a 
remote mountain community, McGillis, 31, plays a strong-willed single mother 
who falls in love with a character played by Kurt Russell, a widower with a 
10-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis acknowledges that the movie is flawed, but she says she was happy with 
her work in it because of the range of emotions she was challenged to meet. She 
says she took the role of Collie Wright, a single mother "grappling with her 
place in society," specifically because of those emotional demands. 
</P>
<P>
"All the tears and emotional peaks are real," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the good notices for her last film, "The Accused," went to her co-star, 
Jodie Foster, who won the best-actress Oscar for playing the role McGillis 
turned down. McGillis had her choice of the film's two lead roles and said she 
accepted the part of the prosecuting attorney instead of the rape victim 
because she had been the victim of a rape herself in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis has spoken publicly about her rape experience and wrote a first-person 
account of it for "People" magazine last year. Despite her screen image and the 
articulate efforts she has made on behalf of rape treatment centers, the 
actress wears her insecurities on her sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a big phobia about not being smart," she says. "I'm not book-smart, but 
I think I'm very instinctual. I always try to better myself, but I'll probably 
go to my grave feeling inadequate." CLAUDIA PUIG

THE CONTROVERSY OVER BLACKS AND SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Please! Can't we in this country knock off these racist "studies"? 
</P>
<P>
Just because black athletes are dominant in one or two sports (such as some 
track events and basketball), why must Tom Brokaw or anyone else produce a 
television special on that subject? Because it is sensational, that is why! 
</P>
<P>
Actually, this is old stuff. When Jesse Owens, et al., were prominent in track 
and field in the 1930s, whites came up with all sorts of weird explanations for 
the supposed superiority: longer heels, bigger hips . . . such trash. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pseudo-intellectualizing of Robert Malina cited by Rosenberg, it 
remains true that race has nothing to do with black success in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
I don't often agree with Harry Edwards, the white media's favorite sociologist, 
but in this case he is right: Poorer people, not merely blacks, tend to excel 
in sports. The era of the Stan Musials and all those sons of white miners back 
in the East wasn't all that long ago. How can we forget the eras in which the 
Irish and the Italians were more prominent in sports than they are today?

THE CONTROVERSY OVER BLACKS AND SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Rosenberg's April 24 column, "A Compelling Case for Controversy Over 
Black Athletes," misses a major point -- survival of the fittest. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that of the tens of thousands enslaved in Africa's interior, 
forced to walk to the coast and then shipped in ghastly conditions to the 
United States, far fewer than half survived the long and horrible journey. 
</P>
<P>
The weak died; the strongest lived. As a result, black Americans have a fitter 
heritage, shown in the number of successful black athletes we have. There is 
nothing racist about this; it is history.

POP BEAT: STONE-FACED ROCK FROM DOGS D'AMOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those lashing, slashing guitars . . . those tattered, shattered vocals . . . 
those boozy, bluesy tunes. . . . No, it wasn't the Rolling Stones, or even the 
Rod Stewart-era Faces, but yet another English import: the Dogs D'Amour. 
</P>
<P>
Performing before a near-capacity crowd Thursday at the Whisky, the quartet 
displayed a staggering, swaggering sense of swashbuckling style, a two-fisted 
command of stage 'n' sound and the uncommon good sense to keep all their songs 
short. This last element was especially welcome, 'cause there wasn't much 
variation, virtuosity or subtle nuance in the group's knock 'em back, rock 'em 
back attack. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if these good-bad, but not evil characters ever come up with one song 
the equal of their influences, they'll be bashin' out the trash and countin' 
the cash for as long as their collective livers hold up. DON WALLER

POP BEAT: GRANDEUR AND MEANING FROM SCOTLAND'S URE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scottish singer-guitarist Midge Ure has long been known to strive for grand, 
orchestral sweep. Ure's show Thursday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano 
could have used some more earthy qualities, such as humor or an occasional bit 
of basic, bash-it-out rock or quiet simplicity. But its best moments were in 
fact grand, and its less successful segments never sounded like bloated huffing 
and puffing. 
</P>
<P>
With his clear, rangy voice and fervent but unpretentious delivery, Ure, who 
plays tonight at the Wiltern, was generally up to the task of putting across 
the socially conscious themes of his new album, "Answers to Nothing," or the 
high romanticism of songs by his former band, Ultravox. Ure's greatest asset 
was an expert backing band that kept the focus on rhythmic propulsion even as 
it was helping him pile up layers of sound. It all came together in "Hymn," an 
Ultravox song that rolled along like a crashing wave as Ure sang its prayer for 
a life of grandeur and meaning. MIKE BOEHM

POP BEAT: TEEN SCREAMS FOR SHY NEW ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Order has been together for almost a decade, but the quartet from 
Manchester, England, still has the same testy, sloppy edge of a disgruntled 
post-punk garage band. Maybe that's part of the appeal that packed in all those 
screaming techno-teens on the first of two nights at the Universal Amphitheatre 
on Thursday. Or maybe it was just the striking lighting patterns or the booming 
sequencer patterns that had 'em bouncing. 
</P>
<P>
It can't be stage presence: Peter Hook, resembling a gnarly refugee from an 
German S&amp;M biker club as he pulled dinosaur growls out of his low-slung 
bass, was inappropriately weird, while guitarist/vocalist Bernard Albrecht's 
watery little dance moves and wisp of a voice shouldn't threaten Michael 
Jackson in the near future. But it's this lack of pretension, the vulnerable 
way that a shy, disenfranchised Albrecht struggles to convey a message of 
personal pain above the din of the disco machines in songs like "Perfect Kiss" 
that makes New Order still worth a scream or two. CRAIG LEE

POP BEAT: MIKE + 2 GREAT SINGERS STILL = A MECHANICAL SHOW

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the Mike + the Mechanics show at the Universal Amphitheater Wednesday 
night, you couldn't help feeling sorry for singers Paul Young and Paul Carrack. 
They're first-rate rock vocalists, capable of intense expression and excitement 
with the right material. 
</P>
<P>
But they're not miracle workers. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that this band, headed by British bassist/guitarist Mike 
Rutherford when he's not working in Genesis, doesn't have any songs these 
vocalists can sink their teeth into. They do elevate overly sentimental, 
skin-deep tunes like "All I Need Is a Miracle" and "The Living Years," but not 
to a level of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Like Genesis colleague Phil Collins, Rutherford needs a pop/commercial outlet 
for material that's not suitable for Genesis. With the Mechanics, he's been 
very successful at cranking out soppy, yuppified pop-rock. But he should aim 
higher than lowest-common-denominator rock -- and stop wasting the talents of 
Young and Carrack. DENNIS HUNT LIVE ACTION: New Order will return to the 
Southland, heading a tour also featuring Public Image Ltd. and the Sugarcubes, 
with a date at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on June 16. Tickets will go on 
sale May 6. . . . Former Husker Du singer/songwriter Bob Mould will be at the 
Roxy on May 17. Tickets on sale now. . . . The third annual L.A. Salsa Fest 
will take place May 20 and 21 at the John Anson Ford Theatre.

YOUTH, 17, SLAIN IN FIGHT WITH SCHOOL POLICEMAN INVESTIGATING BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth was shot to death Friday by a San Diego Unified School 
District police officer responding to a burglary call at Zamorano Elementary 
School in Paradise Hills, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Virgil Marino, of Paradise Hills, was shot once in the chest by Officer 
Ray Cook about 2:20 a.m. as Cook, 56, and another officer tried to arrest 
Marino in a dark classroom at the school, San Diego Police Sgt. Ray Sigwalt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police later found a knife and a crude bomb inside the kindergarten classroom 
near Marino, Sigwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's partner, David Helms, 47, was hit under the left arm by a bullet from 
Cook's .38-caliber revolver, which accidentally discharged shortly before the 
fatal shot was fired. The accidental shot was fired when Cook struck Marino 
over the head twice with the gun during the struggle, Sigwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Wore Protective Vest 
</P>
<P>
Helms was wearing a protective vest and suffered bruised ribs, Sigwalt said. 
Cook suffered cuts on his shins and a cut on his right index finger, according 
to a spokeswoman at Paradise Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Both were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's shooting was the first by an on-duty officer in the 20-year history of 
the San Diego Unified School District, said Richard Ewens, supervisor for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly the entire incident, which lasted about seven minutes, occurred in 
darkness after both uniformed officers dropped their flashlights to defend 
themselves, Sigwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Answered Silent Burglar Alarm Report 
</P>
<P>
According to Sigwalt, Cook and Helms answered a report of a silent burglar 
alarm at 2:17 a.m. at the school in the 2600 block of Casey Street, Sigwalt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers saw a broken window, entered the classroom through the door and 
shined their flashlights across the room, spotting Marino crouched in a corner, 
Sigwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
After at first cooperating and lying face down to let the officers handcuff 
him, Marino sprang to his feet and began to swing at the two, Sigwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire struggle took place in the dark," Sigwalt said. "They didn't have 
much time to know what was happening," he said of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
During the fight, Sigwalt said, Cook felt something on Marino he thought was a 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The fight escalated after Cook hit Marino over the head with his gun, firing 
the accidental shot, Sigwalt said. He then fired at Marino from close range, 
Sigwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
"After Helms was struck with the accidental shot and left the fight, it became 
apparent to Cook that he was losing the fight," Sigwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
"After the kid was down, they illuminated the area by him," Sigwalt said. "He 
had a knife by him." 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's deputy called to the scene found a crude bomb under Marino when he 
was turned over, Sigwalt said. The youth also had electrical tape wrapped 
around his waist, Sigwalt said.

The San Diego Fire Department's Explosives Device Team was called in to X-ray 
the bomb, which was described as a tightly taped, 6-inch cardboard cylinder 
filled with gunpowder and buckshot, Sigwalt said. The bomb was capped with clay 
on both ends and had a slow-burning fuse, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really a pipe bomb, but could be a very effective personal grenade," 
Sigwalt said. "What he was doing in there, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, Josie Marino, told a Channel 39 television reporter: "My son 
was a beautiful boy. I worshiped my son, I idolized that boy." 
</P>
<P>
In a tearful interview, she said she had pleaded with San Diego police to help 
her with her son, who had had many run-ins with officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them: 'Yes, you're going to blow him away, and then you're going to 
blame me.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Contact 
</P>
<P>
Sigwalt confirmed that police had had previous contact with the boy, but 
declined to say what the nature of that contact was. 
</P>
<P>
Students arriving for class at Zamorano at 7:50 a.m. were sent to nearby 
Bethune Elementary School for about an hour while police finished their 
investigation of the scene, said Rachel Flanagan, the school's principal. 
</P>
<P>
"The classroom is shut right now," Flanagan said Friday afternoon. "The kids 
know that we had an intruder. . . . We didn't want to make a big thing out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police are investigating the shooting as a burglary and a 
police-involved shooting, Sigwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings will be turned over to the district attorney's office, which 
will determine whether to press charges against either officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Placed on Leave 
</P>
<P>
Both officers have been put on paid administrative leave for three days, Ewens 
said. They are part of the 34-officer force employed by the San Diego Unified 
School District, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The department also has seven non-sworn officers who mainly work days at 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Cook joined the department in 1972 after working as a California State Police 
officer in Los Angeles, and Helms joined the force in October, 1988, after 
working as a San Diego police officer, Ewens said. 
</P>
<P>
All officers in the department must be graduates of a police academy, pass a 
basic peace officer standard training -- the same used by other law enforcement 
agencies -- and have at least two years of full-time experience in California 
law enforcement, Ewens said.

3RD ESCONDIDO TEEN ARRESTED IN PEARCE SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A third Escondido teen-ager was arrested Friday in connection with the slaying 
of Robert (Wayne) Pearce, the estranged husband of former Orange Glen teacher's 
aide Roberta Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Friday that a 16-year-old student at Orange Glen High School 
surrendered himself and was arrested on suspicion of murder, solicitation of 
murder and conspiracy to murder. 
</P>
<P>
The student was implicated in testimony Thursday in Vista Municipal Court by 
another teen-ager, Anthony Pilato, who along with Isaac Hill, both 15, have 
pleaded guilty to killing Pearce, 40, outside his Cardiff apartment on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Pilato and Hill testified this week in the murder trial of Roberta Pearce, 41, 
alleging that it was at her behest -- and the promise of receiving two cars and 
sharing $100,000 of her husband's $200,000 life insurance policy -- that they 
killed the man. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Pilato testified that he originally was brought into the murder 
scheme by a third teen-ager who lived with Roberta Pearce at her Valley Center 
home. Pilato said the other youth told Pearce that he had found someone who 
would murder her husband and then connected him, Pilato, with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Pilato said he thought the other boy and Pearce were kidding, but that the 
other youth insisted to Pilato that he should kill Robert Pearce and encouraged 
him to carry out the killing when he balked. The boy, however, did not 
participate in the actual killing, Pilato said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Carlos Armour, head of the 
district attorney's juvenile office, the third youth turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
He is being held at Juvenile Hall.

AL MARTINEZ: GETTING THERE THIS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a man on the Westside everyone calls Short Cut Bernstein because he 
never takes a direct route. Tell Bernie that all you want to do is walk one 
block from 4th Street to 5th Street and he will know a shorter way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do," he'll say, "is cut through the kitchen of Chin's Sezchwan 
Restaurant, cross the parking lot, go down the alley and you're there. But 
don't let Chin know you're just cutting through his place. Pretend you've 
dropped by for lunch but suddenly remember something important you have to do 
before you can enjoy his lovely food and you'll be back later. Then split 
through the kitchen and you're on your way." 
</P>
<P>
"What if it isn't the lunch hour," I say, "or if Chin's place is closed?" 
</P>
<P>
"Then you can use the King Carpet Emporium," Bernie says, "but first you have 
to browse a little through their sale carpetry and ask to use their restroom 
and when you get down the hall . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I would not write about Short Cut Bernstein today except that he is 
representative of a Los Angeles subculture that has figured out how to get from 
here to there when the freeways are in chaos and most of what we call the 
surface streets are gridlocked. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after writing about my inability to drive from Topanga to downtown 
L.A. because of problems on both the Santa Monica and Ventura freeways that I 
realized how many exponents of Bernie's philosophy exist. 
</P>
<P>
I must have received 50 letters from people like Bernie telling me how I could 
have done it without the use of freeways. One of the letter-writers said I 
sounded like a damned fool and probably ought not to be going downtown in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
None of those who wrote, however, seemed to possess the short cut expertise on 
a scale comparable to Bernie. He seems to know a short cut that connects any 
two points in town, although I suspect much of it is instinct and not 
knowledge. Otherwise he would have to spend every waking hour studying maps. 
</P>
<P>
Let me offer a modest example of Bernie's almost uncanny abilities. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Bernie owns a car that is in a state of disrepair at least 72% 
of the time, so he telephones his friends to ask for rides. My turn came last 
week. Bernie was stranded at the corner of Beverly Drive and Wilshire 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
He called me downtown and asked if I would pick him up on the way home and 
drive him to Topanga. I said sure and met him on the corner. As we headed south 
on Beverly Drive, Bernie said, "I know a short cut." 
</P>
<P>
I said, "I figured you probably did." 
</P>
<P>
"Which way do you usually go?" 
</P>
<P>
"I go to Pico," I said, "and turn right to Overland. At Overland, I turn left 
and get on the Santa Monica Freeway westbound. If a motorcyclist without a 
helmet hasn't smashed himself against a guard rail, I will traverse the freeway 
to Pacific Coast Highway and turn right on Topanga Canyon Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
"That's crazy," Bernie said. "Pico is a mess and Overland is worst. Keep going 
straight on Beverly." 
</P>
<P>
I followed his advice out of curiosity and began an odyssey on the most 
circuitous route I have ever taken to achieve a destination. It wound and 
twisted through Beverly Hills and Rancho Park on streets named Beverwill and 
Castle Heights and McConnell and Club and Motor and Wala Vista and other 
streets I cannot remember. 
</P>
<P>
"Swear you'll never reveal the exact short cut," Bernie said. "It'll ruin it 
for the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
"I swear." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually we ended up westbound on the Santa Monica Freeway but Bernie said it 
would be crazy to go all the way through McClarren Tunnel to Pacific Coast 
Highway. "That's for real jerkholes," was the way Bernie put it. 
</P>
<P>
He had me get off at Lincoln, cut over to 7th and follow it past San Vicente to 
a street called Entrada, where we twisted down to West Channel and then PCH, 
which was also crowded. 
</P>
<P>
"Now what," I asked, "into the ocean?" 
</P>
<P>
For a moment I thought he was going to say yes. 
</P>
<P>
"What you can do to avoid this mess," he said after a long moment of silence, 
"is to take a long cut." 
</P>
<P>
"A long cut?" 
</P>
<P>
"There's less stress to simply driving than to waiting in traffic. You go up 
Chautauqua to Sunset and then down Sunset to . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I am not in the market for long cuts so I just stayed on PCH and eventually we 
got home, although Bernie sulked the rest of the way. He was angry because I 
ignored his advice. I would have told him to go straight to hell but Bernie 
never goes straight to anything. There's a short cut to that too.

COLD FRONT TO BRIEFLY MAR OTHERWISE NICE WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY RATHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plenty of sunshine and pleasant temperatures are forecast for today, but the 
pattern is expected to break early Sunday when a weak cold front is scheduled 
to make a brief appearance. 
</P>
<P>
With the front will come clouds and cooler temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
The skies are expected to be clear after early-morning low clouds burn off. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be a bad weekend," National Weather Service forecaster Wilbur 
Shigehara said. "The rain will not reach us. It's not a strong storm." 
</P>
<P>
The weather front, from north of the Hawaiian Islands, has brought rain to 
Northern California but is expected to cause nothing more than a light drizzle 
along the coast. A high-pressure system will sap most of the storm's strength 
before it reaches Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Shigehara expects skies to be clear again Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches should be a bit cool this weekend, with highs from 64 to 68 degrees 
today, 62 to 66 Sunday. Daytime temperatures in the coastal strip will reach 67 
to 72 today, 65 to 70 Sunday. Nightly lows will dip to the low- to mid-50s this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Inland areas will remain warm and sunny, with a possible high of 80 degrees 
today, Shigehara said. Some afternoon sunshine is expected Sunday, along with 
highs of 68 to 75. Tonight's lows should drop to 48 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains and deserts will have plenty of sunshine today. On Sunday, 
though, the clouds are due to move in and the winds might hit 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain highs will be 55 to 60 degrees today, 50 to 55 Sunday, Shigehara said. 
Lows from 40 to 50 are expected tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The deserts are expected to reach the high 80s today, falling to 80 to 85 
degrees Sunday. Overnight lows will be in the mid-50s this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The surf will be 2 feet; the ocean temperature is 61 degrees.

SENATE OKS COMMERCE OFFICE IN COUNTY; VETO APPEARS CERTAIN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Thursday easily approved legislation to force the state Commerce 
Department to open an office in San Diego County to aid the development of 
business between companies in the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure, passed by the Senate 34-0 and sent to the Assembly, appears 
headed for a certain veto, just as a similar bill was rejected last year by 
Gov. George Deukmejian. Both bills were carried by Sen. William Craven 
(R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian objected last year to the cost of the new office, which would need 
about $200,000 a year to operate, according to the Commerce Department. And the 
lobbyist for the department said Thursday that the state still lacks the 
resources to open an extra Commerce Department outpost in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is money," said Rich Allen, the department's legislative 
coordinator. "There just isn't the money to open an office -- not that we don't 
want to." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the department does "a land-office business" at its offices in San 
Jose and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego, being the second largest city in the state, I'm sure that we could 
do business there," he said. But Allen added that San Diego is served 
adequately by the department's other offices. 
</P>
<P>
Craven said the office is warranted because San Diego is the "gateway" to the 
Pacific Rim's Latin American sector. 
</P>
<P>
As the California city bordering the United States' third-largest trading 
partner, San Diego has become increasingly involved in the maquiladoras program 
-- under which U. S.- or foreign-owned companies build plants on the Mexican 
side of the border that produce or assemble products destined for sale in the 
United States.

MOTHER TRIED TO ABORT TWINS, DAUGHTER TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who gave birth to twins who later died after a botched abortion 
testified Friday as a key prosecution witness against her mother, who is 
accused of manslaughter in the death of one of the infants. 
</P>
<P>
Ida Franks, 47, of Oceanside, is charged with manslaughter and child abuse in 
the Dec. 30, 1987, death of one of her daughter's babies, who were later placed 
in a trash bin. 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Judkins, 24, of Oceanside, pleaded guilty to child endangerment March 21 
and agreed to testify against her mother. 
</P>
<P>
After Friday's preliminary hearing, San Diego Municipal Judge Robert Stahl 
ordered Franks to stand trial on the felony charges. He set an arraignment and 
trial-setting date for May 11. 
</P>
<P>
Franks rolled her eyes, shook her head repeatedly and stared at her daughter 
continually during her testimony. At one point, she scoffed openly in court 
over something Judkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins testified that a few days before her babies' births, her mother used a 
Lysol-soaked straw to try to induce an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Who else was in the room when the straw was inserted?" asked Francis Bennett, 
Franks' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Just me and her," Judkins replied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Contractions 
</P>
<P>
The daughter said the Lysol did not cause her to bleed, to feel burning or 
pain, and no contractions occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she had used it on herself years ago," Judkins said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she gave birth several days later in her Oceanside apartment, with her 
mother there. The first baby apparently was dead because it was not moving, 
Judkins testified. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins said her mother then decided to go to the store before the second baby 
was born. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she was nervous and needed some beer," Judkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter said her mother was drunk that day. Franks shook her head 
emphatically at that point. 
</P>
<P>
The second baby was born alive, said Judkins, but she said she thought it must 
have died also, because her mother wrapped up the twins' bodies in newspapers 
while she was in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Willie Judkins, a Marine once stationed at Camp Pendleton, 
testified that his mother-in-law called him at the base that day, saying it was 
an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Judkins said he arrived after the babies' births and testified that 
Franks said, "We had to get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
He said he suggested that they call paramedics, but that Franks vetoed the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Ida Franks said they had to be taken far away and buried," Willie Judkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and his mother-in-law drove away with the bodies and later disposed 
of them in two separate trash bins off Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies have never been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Both women remain free on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins will be sentenced May 18 and could get six years in state prison and a 
$10,000 fine. However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said his office would not 
oppose probation. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Willie Judkins will not be prosecuted.

2 KILLED IN 3-CAR CRASH IN LAKESIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were killed when their automobile overturned in a three-car accident 
Friday in Lakeside, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 2:30 p.m. on California 67 near Johnson Lake Road 
when the driver of one car traveling north stopped abruptly, causing it to 
swerve into the southbound lane, striking a second auto, police said. As the 
second car spun around, it was hit by another northbound vehicle, causing the 
second auto to overturn. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims were the second car's driver and passenger, police said. The 
victims' names had not been released as of late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers of the two other cars involved in the accident were uninjured, 
police said.

ARCHBISHOP MAHONY'S LETTER AND ABORTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How ironic that on the same day Mahony writes to criticize your editorial 
supporting abortion there is an article on the Op-Ed Page entitled "Infant 
Mortality: A National Disgrace." The column, by Sen. Bill Bradley, states, 
"More than 40,000 American babies die every year, most of them needlessly . . . 
(due to) poverty, ignorance and neglect." 
</P>
<P>
Where is Archbishop Mahony? Where is the Catholic Church? Where are the 
anti-abortion "pro-life" marchers who want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned? 
</P>
<P>
Where is their conscience when it comes to protecting those who have been born 
and either die within the first few months due to "poverty, ignorance and 
neglect," or go on to become abused or discarded as a result of "poverty, 
ignorance and neglect?" I'd like to see them put an end to the needless 
slaughter (physically and mentally) of the born. 
</P>
<P>
And while they're at it, why don't they adopt a child who is considered 
unadoptable? A child who is no longer an infant, a child who is handicapped, a 
child who is in an institution because no one has loved him/her enough to keep 
him/her from becoming a problem child or a criminal.

ARCHBISHOP MAHONY'S LETTER AND ABORTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony's diatribe (letter, April 21) against your 
pro-choice editorial ("A Major March," April 11) as being "based on three false 
premises" is itself based on false premises. 
</P>
<P>
First, anti-abortion ideas were never the "moral principle upon which our 
country was so firmly founded." "Life from conception" never occurred to the 
Founding Fathers, and was not a part of 18th-Century belief. This nation was 
not founded so the state could post policemen around fertilized eggs at the 
expense of the mother's life and needs. The United States was founded to 
establish freedom, elected government representing the majority political view 
(as every poll shows pro-choice to be), and for protection against religious 
tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
Second, no matter how many times forced-pregnancy advocates may say otherwise, 
fertilized eggs, zygotes, embryos and early-state fetuses are not "human 
beings," "babies" or "unborn children." They will become human beings later, 
when they develop, but an acorn is not a tree and an egg is not a chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, women are human beings, and their wombs are not the property of the 
church or the state. Absolutists would even force women to carry to birth 
pregnancies caused by rape -- thus making the rape last for nine months. Is 
such destruction of women victims somebody's idea of "pro-life?" 
</P>
<P>
Third, while the Archbishop may have his own ideas on jurisprudence, the courts 
have always considered social and public policy in deciding matters of great 
importance. What would happen if Roe vs. Wade were overruled? It would prove 
that the law is nothing but a result-oriented politicized process. Respect for 
both law and government would be destroyed as they became enemies to be hidden 
from, instruments of religious dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it is not because of legal abortion that "we are not taken seriously 
in the international community." Every civilized nation on earth provides safe 
abortion as an option for its people. I have talked to people from other 
countries. We are ridiculed as a backward, puritanical, silly society, with 
pious, smug moralizing constantly spewing from public figures who presume to 
tell people both here and abroad how they should live their private lives and 
conduct their most intimate affairs. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy for Archbishop Mahony to sit in his theological ivory tower and hand 
down edicts about abortion. It is a different story for people who have to live 
in the real world and deal with the tough choices that affect their lives.

ARCHBISHOP MAHONY'S LETTER AND ABORTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been a great many articles and letters concerning the abortion 
issue, however, I believe most are missing the point. It seems to me that the 
real issue is one of old-fashioned responsibility for one's actions which 
everyone wants to evade. It is also an issue of courage and duty. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, a woman should have the courage to say no to sex. (I am deliberately 
not debating incest or rape here.) Once she says yes, then she has to accept 
the responsibilities of her action (as must her partner) and if she becomes 
pregnant, then her God-given duty is to nurture that child to maturity. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment of conception she loses what rights she may have had in favor of 
the unborn child, and even the so-called "point of viability" of a fetus has 
nothing to do with it. Of course, she does not have the right to terminate the 
life of the child in ordinary circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Please, ladies, don't try to shift your responsibilities onto other people.

Pro-life demonstrators should be honored that the lawyers for the American 
Civil Liberties Union are so enthusiastically persecuting them ("$5,000 Fines 
Urged in Abortion Protest," Metro, April 25). 
</P>
<P>
If the ACLU, known for embracing criminals' rights and defending Nazi marchers, 
is against pro-life activities, the pro-life people must be doing something 
right.

WILL ON FAMILY DISINTEGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An example of equivocation commonly used to cover up unpalatable political or 
social conditions comes from a leading expert in this genre, George F. Will, in 
his column on the disintegration of the family (Op-Ed Page, April 9). Here he 
tells us that "The intergenerational transmission of poverty is produced by the 
disintegration of the family structure." Feeling the need to back up this 
egregious piece of deception, he quotes Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's remark 
that " 'poverty had its origin in social behavior,' meaning, primarily, family 
structure." For emphasis he repeats, "Today, family disintegration is one of 
the principle correlates of poverty." Concluding that it "poses the most 
immense challenge to confront American social policy, a problem of 
unprecedented complexity. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
After more than a century of vacant gazing into this "complexity," the high and 
mighty of this society are still at it, still searching for a plausible 
apologia for the scourge of poverty and the way it wrecks family life. In the 
distant past it was laid to improvidence and ignorance of the working class. 
Later, alcoholism was said to be the primary cause, but even while Prohibition 
was in effect poverty was as prevalent as ever. Currently, the crime and drug 
culture is alleged to be at fault. All of these tragic disorders are clearly 
derivative of insecurity, social alienation, family disintegration, and an 
unrelenting poverty that results from a morally reprehensible system of human 
exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Once regarded as the basic unit of society, the broken family is now the 
embodiment of a broken and corrupted social order. By covering it all with 
vague abstractions and "unprecedented complexities," Will and company admit 
that nothing can be done under the aegis of the status quo.

INS AND CARE OF IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank del Olmo has, in his 18 years of writing about immigration, always had 
the problem of separating fact from fantasy, but his "Put Care of Immigrants 
Into New Hands" (Op-Ed Page, April 18), is so loaded with inaccuracies and 
misconceptions that it is painfully obvious that his lengthy residence in The 
Times' ivory tower has taken its toll and he has all but lost contact with the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Let us dissect his first big whopper. Del Olmo, with all evidence decidedly 
pointing to the contrary, comes to the outlandish conclusion that the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service's administering of the amnesty program 
was "haphazard," implying, of course, that it was a failure. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most vocal critics of the INS have had high praise for the extremely 
successful effort extended by the INS in administering this unprecedented 
program. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3 million illegal aliens applied for amnesty as a result of INS' 
massive and finely tuned program across the nation. It is significant, too, 
that fully 85% of these applicants came directly to INS, bypassing church, 
community groups and qualified designated entities, to sign up, dispelling 
completely the so-called "fear of INS factor" clamored by our detractors. Phase 
II of amnesty is now in high gear and we are predicting an equally successful 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
INS has clearly demonstrated during the past two years -- Del Olmo 
notwithstanding -- that it has matured to the point that it can plan and carry 
out even the most difficult programs. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Del Olmo quixotically wonders if lawful immigration duties shouldn't be 
transferred to another agency. "Why fix the wagon when it ain't broke?" INS 
smoothly and efficiently processed last year approximately 660,000 lawful 
immigrants, refugees and other entrants into the United States. Status changes 
and citizenship applicants have only a minimal waiting period and most all 
backlogs have been brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
As to the new reform law, Del Olmo is among those doom-sayers, who from the 
beginning, have said employer sanctions won't work. As a matter of fact, first 
signals indicate the opposite. Nobody said it would work overnight miracles. 
Let's not rush to judgment lest we get egg on our face. Certainly, this is an 
extremely important step forward. 
</P>
<P>
A single border agency would be "worthwhile," Del Olmo says, but he lays its 
death to bureaucratic finagling. He deftly avoids commenting on the Mexican 
viewpoint of such an agency. Down there it was seen as a hostile act tantamount 
to militarizing the border. 
</P>
<P>
As further evidence of his dated thinking, Del Olmo blithely observes that INS 
doesn't need any more Border Patrol agents to control our border. That 
shoot-from-the-hip type analysis is what allowed a flood tide of illegal aliens 
into the United States during the mid- and late-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
If the Border Patrol had had enough agents, just to seal off the El Paso and 
San Diego corridors alone, we could have stymied illegal entry by the hundreds 
of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Del Olmo says our aging population and lowering birth rate will put us 
in a bind because we will need more young foreign workers. 
</P>
<P>
He apparently has forgotten that the immigration reform bill took this fact 
into account. The H-2A (guest worker) program has been streamlined and any 
employer who needs foreign labor can get it with a minimum of difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
All of this makes one wonder: Where have Del Olmo and The Times been for the 
past two years?

ARCHBISHOP MAHONY'S LETTER AND ABORTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're ba-ack! Every time we as women stand up for ourselves and our own 
rights, some petulant man stamps his foot and calls us selfish. Cal Thomas 
(Op-Ed Page, April 13) simplistically reduces the abortion argument to one of 
right and wrong. Such clear vision apparently requires no proof; instead, he 
offers us his general displeasure expressed in the by now standard refrain of 
oooh, oooh, the country is going to hell. 
</P>
<P>
If we wonder where in his either-or philosophy he places reproductive rights, 
we see them glowing through the fog under either men control them or they don't 
exist at all. Men of Thomas' ilk, while bemoaning the "repeal of a moral code" 
(which they often devised for their own convenience), cannot seem to recover 
from not being able to order women about. Talk about "emphasis on self." 
</P>
<P>
Men treat our reproductive rights as a weapon that has been taken away from 
them and must now be recovered only when they forget how they kept those rights 
from us in the first place and doled them out to suit their own souls. When we 
stand up for what is ours to begin with, we may not fit men's fantasy of what 
they'd have us be, but let's not confuse honesty with selfishness -- or 
enforced dependence with morality.

ENCINO GROUPS FORCE BUILDER TO DROP MOVIE THEATER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers fighting Encino residents over the right to build three new cinema 
complexes on Ventura Boulevard may feel like they're starring in a remake of a 
bad movie. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in two weeks, homeowners have successfully fought off a 
proposal to construct a multiscreen movie theater as part of a planned 
neighborhood shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Security Pacific Development Corp. said Friday they are 
abandoning a plan to build a 1,600-seat theater complex as part of a 
$35-million center on the north side of the boulevard east of Encino Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, project manager Doane J. Liu said the firm will build a food market. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Los Angeles city Board of Zoning Appeals voted 3 to 1 to 
reject a planned 1,500-seat theater proposed as the centerpiece of a 
$22-million center at the northeast corner of the boulevard and Gaviota Avenue, 
1 3/4 miles from the Security Pacific land. 
</P>
<P>
That apparently leaves only one Encino theater project in the running -- an 
1,800-seat complex at the northeast corner of the boulevard and Hayvenhurst 
Avenue, between the other two sites. 
</P>
<P>
Elated Encino residents praised Security Pacific's redesign announcement. They 
said it will help reduce traffic on the boulevard and in a 30-year-old 
single-family neighborhood immediately north of the firm's shopping center 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased," said Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, 
who helped negotiate the redesign with Security Pacific officials. "A market is 
something that is needed and the community will patronize." 
</P>
<P>
As a side benefit, exchanging the theaters for the grocery store will allow 
builders to lower the height of the shopping center by more than five feet, to 
just under 40 feet, Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners and Security Pacific developers reached their agreement during a 
meeting at an Encino delicatessen. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the pact, the company will install a permanent metal plaque outside 
the shopping center spelling out operating rules, such as the time of day when 
trash trucks can pick up rubbish, Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, residents will support the development proposal when it is 
reviewed Tuesday by the City Council Planning and Environment Committee, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Liu said the negotiations with Silver's group and with another homeowners 
organization called the Encino Property Owners Assn. were the most extensive 
his firm has ever conducted. He said the company decided to scrap the movie 
theater plan "to cooperate with the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Rival developer Jason Heltzer, whose theater plan was rejected April 11 by the 
Board of Zoning Appeals, will have 15 days to appeal that ruling to the City 
Council once a formal written notice of the ruling is issued. 
</P>
<P>
Silver said he has also offered to negotiate with Heltzer. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him we'll support him if he puts in a supermarket or a full-service 
drugstore or something else that the neighborhood needs," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
"We desperately need several gas stations and things like a knit shop, a good 
hardware store. These things aren't gentrified, but they're necessary. The 
absence of these generates traffic in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't have to drive through these congested, F-level intersections to 
buy a replacement light switch. We need to resuscitate these retail uses that 
are threatened with extinction in Encino."

TAFT HIGH SCHOOL TEAM PREPARES FOR ACADEMIC DECATHLON WITH ALL-NIGHT MENTAL 
CALISTHENICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PROVIDENCE, R.I. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near midnight, members of the Taft High School academic decathlon team studied 
in the finest tradition of cram sessions: They ordered another round of snacks 
and added another layer of crumpled papers to the hotel room floor. 
</P>
<P>
As Thursday turned to Friday, the first day of competition in the national 
academic decathlon, team coach Arthur Berchin paced his neat-as-a-pin room down 
the hall, fighting the urge, he said, to check up on his students. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that this is not the beginning; this is the end of the academic 
decathlon program," said Berchin, who holds a Ph.D in English and left an 
administrative post at UCLA to teach high school. "If they don't know how to 
study now, there's nothing I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Berchin's worries, the team of San Fernando Valley high school seniors, 
winners of the California state championship last month, is considered the 
favorite here. The students of the Woodland Hills campus scored more points in 
the state contest than any of the 36 schools competing for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
Taft last year finished second in the national finals to the J.J. Pearce High 
School team of Richardson, Tex. But there will be no rematch this year. J.J 
Pearce finished second in the Texas state contest. 
</P>
<P>
Taft's closest competitor will probably be another Texas team, however. Deer 
Park High School of Deer Park, Tex., recorded the second-highest total among 
state champions this year. 
</P>
<P>
Berchin, a quiet yet competitive man, said he spent an hour Thursday talking 
with the Deer Park High School coach, hoping to gain some information that 
might prove useful in planning his team's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Texas team members also joined several Taft students for lunch that 
day, but were warned by their coach not to divulge any team secrets, Berchin 
said. Decathlon officials had given each team general outlines of the subjects 
to be addressed in the competition. Each coach plotted a course of study based 
on those outlines. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we wanted to hear his students say that they know nothing about 
economics or physics, that they don't get along and are fighting all the time," 
Berchin said. "But I told the coach I wouldn't pump his students for 
information." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the high school students competing for individual honors, as well 
as a share of the $30,000 in scholarship prize money, the contest is serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"To lose would hurt," said Taft team member Shawn Canter, who has been accepted 
to Stanford and Harvard universities. "I hate to lose." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition Intensifies 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Demsky, one of two girls on the Taft team, said the pressure to win has 
grown as the team advanced to win the Los Angeles Unified School District title 
in November, and then the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we've come this far, we might as well win the whole thing," said 
Demsky, who has a 4.0 grade average and is the Taft senior class valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
During the late-night study session Thursday, team members spent more than an 
hour interrupting one another to tell a reporter stories from the nine months 
spent preparing for the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Rosenthal, for example, wants it known that he was kicked off the swim 
team because of the time required for the decathlon team. Rodney Crump said he 
would have liked to have auditioned for the lead in the school's spring play, 
"West Side Story," but had no time for it. Others said their social life has 
definitely suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Team members teased one another with inside jokes, the meaning of which were 
lost on a stranger. After spending school day afternoons and Saturdays together 
for months, they were as close as a family, with the same sort of affection, 
rivalries and jealousies, their coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Members even showed some Southern California media savvy, cutting one another 
short when a student ventured into controversial subjects. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with contest rules, the nine-member Taft team comprises three 
students with A averages, three with B averages and three with C averages. The 
team's final score will be based on the top two scorers in each grade category. 
</P>
<P>
The academic decathlon includes written examinations in the subjects of math, 
history, fine arts, science, economics, literature and the U.S. presidency. For 
Taft, those exams will be Saturday. The team competed in the other three 
decathlon categories Friday, giving prepared speeches, impromptu speeches, and 
being interviewed by judges about their backgrounds and achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wide difference in grade-point averages, it is nearly impossible to 
distinguish in casual conversation the Taft team's C students from its A 
students. They are all bright, Berchin said, and many are temperamental as well 
because they have grown accustomed to winning and working under their own 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But team member Marc Sarti stands out even in this crowd, teammates said. Sarti 
scored more total points than any student in the state finals last month. He is 
a graduate of the district's Portola Junior High School magnet program, which 
admits only students who score over 150 on IQ tests. 
</P>
<P>
"From a teacher's point of view, a student of his caliber is absorbing a larger 
percentage of instruction when it happens," Berchin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Haven't Opened a Book' 
</P>
<P>
That may explain why Sarti dropped by only briefly to the team's study session 
late Thursday and said, "I haven't opened a book since winning top honors at 
the state competition." 
</P>
<P>
"I was sleeping, but I felt guilty about not doing any work while everybody 
else was up," Sarti said to his teammates, who were studying until about 3 a.m. 
Friday. Others said they have to work hard on their weaker subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Crump, who said math and physics are his weakest subjects, has received an 
acting scholarship from Hollywood's Lee Strasberg Institute and been accepted 
by Columbia University. He said he joined the decathlon team to improve his 
academics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough, but I've improved a lot since the city and state finals," 
Crump said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 family members and school officials have accompanied the Taft team to 
Providence. Today's Super Quiz, the only portion of the academic decathlon open 
to the public, will for the first time be televised on the Los Angeles School 
District's Channel 58 at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Answers Cheered 
</P>
<P>
Students in the Super Quiz answer questions in front of a large crowd that 
cheers for correct answers. In the state championship, Taft pulled ahead near 
the end of the 50-question contest. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Super Quiz results will be available Saturday, the overall 
champion won't be known until all scores are tallied and the winner is 
announced Monday. The other Taft team members are Andrew Goodman, Michael 
Pocrass, Roy Rapoport and Deborah Sim. 
</P>
<P>
Crump and several other team members got a bit of unexpected encouragement from 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was staying at their hotel to address a convention. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that he was an inspiration to me," Crump said. "He said, 'Keep up 
the good work.' "

Bob Larkin, a longtime Republican activist and former Simi Valley Chamber of 
Commerce president, announced Friday that he has decided to oppose beleaguered 
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) in the 1990 primary. 
</P>
<P>
"I've decided that I think there's enough support to start a good, hard 
campaign," said Larkin, who owns a State Farm Life Insurance Co. agency. "I'm 
in it for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, 52, first vice chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central 
Committee, filed papers earlier this month to run, but he said he had not made 
a final decision. He said Friday that he has recruited volunteers, raised 
$1,000 in small contributions and plans to lease a campaign office in Simi 
Valley next week. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by controversy surrounding Wright, at least two other well-connected 
Republicans are said to be weighing possible candidacies in her sprawling 37th 
Assembly District, which includes parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Support 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wilcox, a former aide to Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette 
(R-Northridge), is openly courting support. Hunt Braly, administrative 
assistant to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), is also exploring a potential 
primary bid, according to Larkin and another Republican activist. 
</P>
<P>
Wright angered Republican Assembly colleagues in December when she abstained 
from a vote to oust Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). Most of her 
colleagues voted for Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), one of five 
insurgent Democrats who had challenged Brown's leadership. Wright said she had 
promised constituents that she would not vote for any Democrat for speaker. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ventura County District Attorney Michael D. Bradbury's office is 
completing its investigation into reports that Wright improperly sought to use 
her clout with judges, the Simi Valley Police Department and the state 
Department of Motor Vehicles to keep her frequently ticketed daughter, 
Victoria, from losing her driver's license or incurring other penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury is expected to issue his report in early May. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Wright, who has received 27 traffic tickets since 1981, lost her 
license March 9. She is serving a 30-day jail term in the Ventura County work 
furlough program for violating conditions of her probation for a traffic 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright, who has refused comment pending the release of Bradbury's 
report, could not be reached Friday.

HANG GLIDERS TO HONOR THEIR 'GIANT EAGLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 60 hang glider pilots will launch themselves off ridges of the San 
Gabriel Mountains and soar above Sylmar skies this weekend to honor a founder 
of one of the nation's most popular gliding sites. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Scott, who died at 32 in September after a nine-year battle with cancer, 
was a hero to members of the Sylmar Hang Gliding Assn. He was a test glider 
pilot from Northridge and a pioneering flier who dared to ride the thermal 
waves above Sylmar before hang gliding became a well-known Southern California 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"He was distinguished in the sense that he was one of the first hang gliders in 
the area and competed with world-class gliders," said Joe Greblo, who founded 
the Sylmar hang glider group with Scott. "We felt we had to remember him and 
honor him in a way he would appreciate." 
</P>
<P>
The Jeff Scott Hang Gliding Competition will begin at 11 a.m. today at the 
crest of Kagel Mountain, 3,300 feet above sea level. Spectators may gather at 
the landing field at the northern end of Gridley Street in Sylmar. Pilots of 
canvas-winged gliders will race along a 25-mile air path in the mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
Scott knew the route well, having first launched himself off the summit in 
1972. He participated in the first U.S. national hang gliding competition in 
Sylmar in 1973 and holds a long-distance record for gliding from Palmdale to 
Santa Monica in 1979, Greblo said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that record flight, he contracted a rare form of cancer with a 
complicated name his mother does not remember how to pronounce. "It began with 
a growth beneath his chin and slowly spread to his lungs," Beverly Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
But for nearly nine years, while undergoing chemotherapy and other treatment, 
Jeff Scott flew. He worked as a heater and air-conditioning maintenance man for 
the Los Angeles Unified School District during the school year and devoted his 
summers to flying, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his whole life. He did it every chance he got," Beverly Scott said. 
"When he first started, he used to tell me not to worry because more people 
have died in bed than have died hang gliding." 
</P>
<P>
His friends recall that six months before his death, weakened and with troubled 
breathing, he flew from the Sylmar site, where warm weather and scenic vistas 
annually attract thousands of pilots. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff just couldn't let go of his glider," said Erica Koesler, a Sun Valley 
pilot. "I remember we helped him up the mountain and practically picked him up 
and launched him ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, at 6 feet, 7 inches, literally stood out from the troupe of glider 
pilots. When he harnessed himself to his wings his friends said he was like a 
giant eagle. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jeff was up in the air," Beverly Scott said, "it was his freedom."

I can't believe that Mal Florence and Bob Oates came up with racism as one of 
the possibilities for Rodney Peete being drafted so late. 
</P>
<P>
In a sport dominated by black players, what kind of sense does that make? It 
just may be that the people who pay out all those big bucks are better 
qualified to judge athletic ability than many sports writers.

JOHN LONGDEN MADE HIS LAST RIDE PAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conspicuous by its absence among Earl Gustkey's examples of sports figures who 
retired "the right way" was John Longden. 
</P>
<P>
In the final race of his great riding career, Longden won Santa Anita's San 
Juan Capistrano Handicap by a nose while aboard George Royal on March 12, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
George Royal was not the favorite, either. He was given only a so-so chance, 
going off at odds of 6-1. Yet, Longden ended his riding career with a win in 
fairy-tale fasion, providing thoroughbred racing with one of its most emotional 
moments ever. 
</P>
<P>
Longden retired as winningest jockey in history with 6,032 victories. It was a 
record that stood until Bill Shoemaker broke it in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The win by Longden on George Royal will be a difficult act to top for Shoemaker 
when he rides in his final race sometimes in the not too distant future.

The NFL's recent snubbing of USC's talented quarterback, Rodney Peete, during 
its draft was compounded by the Raiders' questionable sixth-round selection of 
the immortal Jeff Francis of Tennessee (one pick before Detroit selected 
Peete). 
</P>
<P>
I know Al Davis was burned in his previous attempt to turn a sixth-rounder into 
a competent quarterback (see Rusty Hilger), but Peete's no sixth-rounder.

WEEKEND RACING AT HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
WINNING COLORS BIGGER, STRONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bigger, stronger, faster Winning Colors is a pretty terrifying idea to the 
opposition. But that is exactly what may be in store when the 1988 Kentucky 
Derby heroine returns to competition today at Hollywood Park in the 
seven-furlong A Gleam Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a little scary to think about it," said her trainer, Jeff Lukas. "But 
she is bigger than last year, more muscled, and a lot more settled mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors gave Lukas, 31, and his famous father, Wayne, their first Derby 
victory when she defeated a field of colts that included Risen Star, Forty 
Niner, Seeking the Gold and Lively One. She has earned nearly $1.4 million for 
owner Gene Klein -- who bought her for $575,000 as a yearling -- and took the 
1988 Eclipse Award as champion 3-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
But with Easy Goer, Sunday Silence and even Klein's current love, Open Mind, 
having stolen the headlines in 1989, Winning Colors has been very much in the 
background. She has not run since her narrow loss to Personal Ensign in the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff last Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs, and, remarkably, she has 
not won a race since the '88 Derby, exactly 51 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the towering roan daughter of Caro remains one of the true stars of the 
racing world, a horse that gets fan mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she'll put on a hell of a show Saturday," said Gary Stevens, her 
regular rider. "Her greatness might have been a little bit overshadowed last 
year by Personal Ensign. But from watching her train, I think you can count on 
her being even better this year." 
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors had by far the best "losing" record in the game last year, going 
four for 10 in a campaign that began at Santa Anita in January and ended in the 
rain at Churchill Downs on Breeders' Cup Day. In four of those setbacks she ran 
well enough to win, suffering no loss of stature or popularity. 
</P>
<P>
When she takes on her seven A Gleam opponents today, Winning Colors will be 
running dead into the head wind of racing history, which is littered with the 
sad tales of champion 3-year-old fillies who have flopped the next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the last half-century, there have been only six filly champions who were 
good enough to repeat at 4: Two Lea, 1949-50; Royal Native, 1959-60; Cicada, 
1962-63; Susan's Girl, 1972-73; Desert Vixen, 1973-74, and Life's Magic, 
1984-85, who was trained by the Lukases. The Lukas-trained Sacahuista was 
champion in 1987 and failed to win a race in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"No question there is pressure bringing a champion back," Jeff Lukas said 
Friday. "You don't want to get them beat. You try to map out the program that's 
best and hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
Everything about Winning Colors spells ready for the A Gleam. She had been in 
steady training at Hollywood Park since mid-January. Her workout pattern since 
early March has been a picture of consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"You could just about set your watch by her lately," Jeff Lukas said. "She's 
worked every Tuesday for the last month. But you can only work them so long and 
then you've got to run. The A Gleam came up at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
She will carry top weight of 123 pounds in the $82,400 A Gleam, while breaking 
from the fifth post position. The opposition includes Behind the Scenes, 
Tomorrow's Child, Never Cee Miss, Sadie B. Fast, Hot Novel, Survive and Daloma. 
</P>
<P>
Political Ambition and Steinlen will bring their act back to Hollywood Park for 
the $109,700 Premiere Handicap on Sunday. Steinlen set the stakes record of 
1:33 1/5 for the mile on the turf in last year's running, but the English horse 
was a hard-luck third to Political Ambition in the El Rincon Handicap at Santa 
Anita April 9. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the field features Gay Burslem, Peace, Skip Out Front, Good Taste, 
Half a Year and Putting.

PAYMENT ENDS MRS. ROGERS' TIES TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their first public appearance since the March 10 bombing of their van on a 
La Jolla street, Navy Capt. Will Rogers III and his wife, Sharon, said Friday 
that Sharon Rogers will not be returning to her fourth-grade teaching position 
at the La Jolla Country Day School. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, the Rogerses sharply denounced the exclusive 
private academy for bowing to an apparent act of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of a severance agreement with the school, Sharon Rogers, a 
12-year veteran teacher there, will receive a lump sum payment of $135,000, 
plus $5,000 for her attorney, and will not return to the campus, where school 
officials believe her presence would pose a risk to the safety of students and 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI has been investigating the van bombing as a possible reprisal for Capt. 
Rogers' order to shoot down an Iranian passenger jet that neared his ship, the 
guided missile cruiser Vincennes, in the Persian Gulf last summer. All 290 
people aboard the plane were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past weeks I have felt many different emotions, but today I am simply 
just disappointed," said Sharon Rogers, fighting back tears, "more disappointed 
than I can possibly express. I will miss my relationship with the school. But 
most of all I will miss my students and their courageous and thoughtful 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
Both Capt. Rogers and his wife said they believe the van bombing was an act of 
terrorism. Mrs. Rogers added that the school, by barring her from campus, was 
sending out a message that it was bowing to terrorism. "I feel very sad for our 
country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Fipp, president of the school's board of trustees, said in a letter 
Friday to the school's parents and staff that safety was the prime motivator in 
the school's decision that Sharon Rogers should not return to teach her 
fourth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
"The school believed, and continues to believe, that Sharon's presence on 
campus would pose an unreasonable risk to the children at the school," Fipp 
said. "The school believes that the presence of the 24-hour federal protection 
now being offered to Sharon is evidence of the risks involved." 
</P>
<P>
The school, with 700 students and 67 teachers, has been the subject of intense 
criticism, both in San Diego and across the country -- including a pointed 
comment from the White House -- in the weeks following the attack. 
</P>
<P>
One of the toughest questions facing the school administration was why it moved 
so quickly to remove Rogers from the faculty, without waiting to see whether 
the FBI determines that the bombing was indeed a terrorist act. 
</P>
<P>
Other than confirming that the explosive device was a pipe bomb, FBI agents 
have declined to reveal the status of their continuing probe. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers was not injured in the van blast. Feeling a jolt and thinking 
that her van had been rear-ended, she had jumped from the vehicle moments 
before it was engulfed in flames. But she described that incident as a 
"life-altering event" highlighted by the ensuing battle over whether she would 
be allowed to return to her job. 
</P>
<P>
The Rogerses were escorted to the press conference at a Mission Valley hotel by 
a large contingent of security officials from the Naval Investigative Service. 
When they sat down before the microphones, the security detail posted itself at 
both entrances to the room and in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers maintained that the school would be secure with her there because 
of the added Navy protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they would be very safe with the NIS agents there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy M. Burns, the school's headmaster, who came under sharp criticism from 
some parents and teachers over his handling of the Rogers affair, could not be 
reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Roth, a Pasadena public relations specialist hired by the school, said 
the 18-member board's vote Friday morning "was not unanimous but overwhelmingly 
in favor of approval" of the decision to sever ties with Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the board agreed to pay her $135,000, when her current-year contract 
is for $32,400, Roth said: 
</P>
<P>
"We want to avoid a legal action. Instead of paying legal fees (from a 
lawsuit), we believe it is more appropriate to provide Sharon with this 
compensation." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Rogers said he was disappointed in the way the school treated his wife, 
but said he was proud of the way she held up after suffering the horror of 
having a terrorist "light a fireball under her van." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that someone in the dead of night put a bomb on the undercarriage of 
my van and whoever that person was, is a terrorist," Sharon Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband added, "I think they will run aground and they will be brought to 
justice. Whether it's a state-sponsored act or an individual act or a 
disgruntled sailor, whatever it will be, it will all come to light." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he sympathized with the intense media and community scrutiny his 
wife had faced. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the misfortune of being at the center of my 15 minutes of fame earlier," 
he said, referring to his decision to shoot down the Iranian plane. 
</P>
<P>
While Mrs. Rogers said that recent events have dramatically changed her life, 
she said she plans to immediately begin seeking work at another school in the 
San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to start pounding the pavement next week," she said. "I'm going to 
update my resume and hit the bricks on Monday."

<P>
It was 8:55 a.m. on April 10, and Peter Ueberroth hadn't slept all night. But 
as he arrived at National Airport, he wore a smile because he thought he had 
just pulled off one of the most dramatic business deals in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
He bought a ticket on the Pan Am shuttle to New York's LaGuardia Airport. He 
had only a raincoat over his shoulder, a small, blue canvas tote bag and the 
clothes on his back, including his lucky red and gray tie. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you going after New York -- back to Washington or out to 
California?" Ueberroth was asked as he rode up an escalator to the boarding 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confident Reply 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said confidently. "I'll be going to Miami." 
</P>
<P>
Miami is the headquarters of bankrupt, strikebound Eastern Airlines, and 
Ueberroth had just spent the night hammering out arrangements to become its new 
owner. He planned to fly down that afternoon and celebrate with its 
hard-pressed employees. 
</P>
<P>
But as soon as the former baseball commissioner got to New York, someone threw 
him a curve ball -- one that not even he could hit. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the profound distrust that had built up over the years between 
Eastern's managers and its workers proved impossible to overcome, even with a 
bankruptcy judge swinging a club and a bona fide hero of the 1980s rushing to 
the rescue. And Ueberroth's private doubts about the airline ultimately blocked 
a last-ditch compromise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Array of the Elite 
</P>
<P>
More than just another corporate buyout, the Eastern-Ueberroth drama was an 
especially rich tale whose cast of characters came to include a remarkable 
array of America's political, corporate, and sports elite. 
</P>
<P>
And its collapse had implications that went well beyond the pocketbooks of the 
airline's shareholders. At the least, it meant that the vast majority of 
Eastern's fleet of airplanes would remain grounded for weeks to come as one of 
the most important strikes of the decade dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
The deal's demise also dashed the hopes of thousands of striking, picketing or 
laid-off employees that they would soon be back to work as part owners of 
Eastern. And it increased the risk that the venerable airline would vanish 
altogether, its pieces sold off one by one. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth's plan to buy Eastern was a captivating one. It would have joined the 
highly successful engineer of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, a man who went on 
to restore power and direction to the office of baseball commissioner, with a 
history-laden airline mired in one of the nation's most bitter labor-management 
disputes since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
A cartoon in the newspaper USA Today depicted Ueberroth as Superman swooping in 
to carry the beleaguered airline to safety. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
Little of the episode took place in public, but several of the key participants 
agreed to tell the story, in many cases on the condition that they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The story had its roots in a previous era at Eastern that ended in early 1986, 
when the airline's unions ousted Frank Borman, the former astronaut who was 
Eastern's chairman, enabling Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp. to buy Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
March 4 Walkout 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lorenzo and Eastern's unions have been perpetually at war. The 
battles culminated in a March 4 walkout by the machinists that has been honored 
by the pilots and flight attendants, grounding 90% of Eastern's flights. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Ueberroth's flirtation with Eastern goes back a couple of years to 
the day when, Lorenzo says, he tried to hire Ueberroth to run the airline. But 
apparently, Ueberroth had bigger things in mind. As his baseball job wound 
down, Ueberroth met several of Eastern's union leaders at his office in 
November. Nothing came directly of the meeting except that Ueberroth handed out 
some autographed World Series baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
But during the first week in March, at baseball meetings in Ft. Lauderdale, he 
discussed Eastern with Carl Pohlad, the owner of the Minnesota Twins baseball 
club and a member of Texas Air's board. Pohlad had been prodding Lorenzo to 
sell Eastern and was a fan of Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
On March 14, Ueberroth called his good friend and golfing partner, J. Thomas 
Talbot, who lives in Newport Beach. Talbot, 53, and Ueberroth, 51, had been 
friends for a decade and both men had plenty of travel industry experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Come to New York," implored Ueberroth, who had only 17 more days as the czar 
of major league baseball. Talbot was on the next plane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cast of Specialists 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth also lined up a cast of specialists that included attorney Robert J. 
Rosenberg, an expert on bringing companies out of bankruptcy, and ex-pilot and 
Pan Am vice-chairman Martin Shugrue, who had the twin virtues of being a pilots 
union member and having once been fired by Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Ueberroth -- still baseball commissioner -- and Talbot went 
to Texas Air Corp.'s Rockefeller Center offices for the first of several days 
of meetings in which Ueberroth shuttled between Texas Air and the baseball 
commissioner's office five blocks away in mid-town Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
A Ueberroth confidant likened the talks to a scene from a "Sesame Street" story 
where one of the characters, Bert, is trying to get his friend Ernie to take a 
bath: 
</P>
<P>
"Ernie keeps asking for more things to be put in the tub before he'll take a 
bath . . . a duck, a boat. . . . He'd say he was ready, then it would be one 
more thing. . . . It was the same with Lorenzo. It was always one more thing. 
Peter was angry and frustrated in this period." Lorenzo declined to discuss the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Ueberroth got some unsolicited advice on the deal from an old 
friend, Beverly Hills junk bond king Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Talks Alive 
</P>
<P>
Several times, baseball owner Pohlad had to intervene to keep talks alive. One 
such occasion was when Ueberroth's $464-million offer was exceeded by Chicago 
hotel magnate Jay A. Pritzker, said a Ueberroth associate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're history," said a disgusted Ueberroth, declaring the deal was kaput. He 
spent his last day as baseball commissioner on March 31 and returned with 
Talbot to Newport Beach to play golf. 
</P>
<P>
Pohlad tracked them down and persuaded them to return to New York for more 
talks by telling them the Pritzker offer was soft. 
</P>
<P>
The deal headed toward the ditch again on April 5, leading Pohlad to initiate a 
90-minute one-on-one meeting of Lorenzo and Ueberroth at the Boardroom, a 
private lunch club on Park Avenue. This time they got the deal buttoned up. 
</P>
<P>
At a hastily called press conference at the Summit Hotel April 6, it was 
announced to the world that Ueberroth would pay $463.9 million for the ailing 
carrier and the employes would own one-third of his new company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1 Billion in Concessions 
</P>
<P>
But the deal was subject to Ueberroth's ability to bring back by midnight on 
April 11 an agreement with Eastern's three unions that was satisfactory to him 
and to Lorenzo -- namely, about $1 billion in wage and benefit concessions over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
The talks moved to Washington, where Ueberroth and Talbot had an informal 
get-together with the key union leaders and their aides at Gary's, a favorite 
restaurant of a machinists leader. Several unionists came away from the 
gathering with the feeling that they knew considerably more about Eastern than 
Ueberroth and Talbot did. They were right. 
</P>
<P>
The Californians had a recent cram course on the carrier, while the unionists 
had been living and breathing Eastern's books and operations for years. In 
fact, the unions had been attempting to find a buyer for Eastern for some time 
and tried to entice Carl C. Icahn, TWA's chairman, to buy it. The company had 
lost more than $500 million in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The unions' search for a buyer showed not only how much they despised Lorenzo, 
but how the unions had redefined their roles in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
These were not the heavy-handed men of movie newsreels of the 1930s. Many of 
them wore gray suits. And the pilots and machinists employed sophisticated 
financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran Chrysler Bailout 
</P>
<P>
They included Farrell Kuper-smith, an impeccably dressed managing partner at 
Touche Ross, the big accounting firm; Brian Freeman, a fast-talking 
Harvard-educated lawyer who ran President Jimmy Carter's Chrysler bailout 
program, and Randy Barber, Dartmouth-educated, cowboy-booted co-author of a 
1978 book about how unions could increase their power through more adroit use 
of their pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
But in addition to expert partisans in the Lorenzo, Ueberroth and union camps, 
there was an indirect but powerful third party to the talks: federal Judge 
Burton R. Lifland, who has handled the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case Eastern filed 
five days after the strike started. 
</P>
<P>
A bombastic sort in the courtroom who had handled such major bankruptcies as 
Manville Corp. and LTV Corp., Lifland had declared Eastern Airlines a "national 
asset" that needed to be saved. To that end, he named 60-year-old David I. 
Shapiro as a special examiner in the case. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, April 7, the day after Ueberroth's deal was announced in New York, 
many of the key players convened in the offices of the machinists union on 
Connecticut Avenue in Washington. Shapiro took control. 
</P>
<P>
"Shapiro was in a way like Patton," said one union source. 
</P>
<P>
A Brooklyn native, Shapiro had started practicing law 40 years ago in a small 
office above a delicatessen on New York's Upper West Side. His early clients 
included prostitutes, union members and hundreds of citizens accused of 
disloyalty during the McCarthy era. Today, he is a senior partner in a 
high-powered Washington law firm whose other partners include Leonard Garment, 
counsel to former President Richard M. Nixon and one-time National Security 
Adviser Robert C. McFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Lifland said he wanted a "head banger" to get Eastern flying again, and 
the brawny Shapiro filled the bill. He gave the unions 2 1/2 days to reach an 
agreement with Ueberroth, touching off a round-the-clock bargaining session 
among several dozen negotiators from the three unions, the bankruptcy court and 
the Ueberroth camp. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ueberroth was promising something the unions had wanted for years -- 
part-ownership of Eastern -- the union leaders had their doubts about the 
smooth-talking former travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily, they weren't sure if Ueberroth's plan was economically viable. They 
were concerned that it would burden Eastern with too much debt and that he was 
giving away too many valuable assets to Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
Others noted that Lorenzo had once tried to hire Ueberroth and that he was the 
only potential purchaser Lorenzo had been willing to deal with, while 
stiff-arming Icahn. To some, Ueberroth was Lorenzo's "designated hitter" and 
that made them nervous. However, as time went on the unions increasingly 
trusted Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
And as soon as the meetings started Friday in Washington, Shapiro made it clear 
there was "a deal out there and we had to accept it," one union source said. 
"He also said we had to forget about Icahn." Shapiro also warned the unions 
about tinkering with the Ueberroth-Lorenzo deal because that might prompt 
Lorenzo "to walk away from the deal." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Ueberroth flew off to Beverly Hills to speak at Drexel Burnham's 
elaborate annual "junk bond" conference while the bargainers met at machinists 
headquarters in Washington. Ueberroth returned that night in time to pick up 
the dinner tab at Gary's. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Shapiro locked them all in his warren-like law offices until 
6 a.m. Monday. To avoid leaks, he banned phone calls unless a secretary 
listened in. Deli food was brought in for lunch, Chinese for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
While an accord was being hammered out on hundreds of complex matters, a 
simpler -- but more emotional and ultimately pivotal -- issue could only be 
resolved by Judge Lifland. That was the question of who would run Eastern 
between the time a deal was struck and the transaction was finally closed, 
which could take months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo Ouster Demanded 
</P>
<P>
The union leaders demanded that Lorenzo be ousted immediately -- a move that 
the court could accomplish by naming a trustee to temporarily run the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the long weekend in Washington, the unionists say Shapiro gave 
them the impression that they would not have to go back to work under Lorenzo. 
That was critical. In fact, they called this a no-compromise "deal point." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Harry Jones, the top New York bankruptcy court official, was at the 
sessions and drafted the paper work for the appointment of a trustee to run 
Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro himself that weekend phoned George P. Shultz, the former secretary of 
state, to ask if he would act as the trustee. Shultz begged off. He not only 
didn't want to leave California but is a director of Boeing Co., one of 
Eastern's creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Then Shapiro called Frank C. Carlucci, the former secretary of defense, and he 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poison Pill' Scheme 
</P>
<P>
The unions showed their distrust of Lorenzo by devising a "poison pill" scheme 
in which they agreed to about $16.6 million a month in wage concessions 
earmarked for an escrow account -- savings that Eastern could only keep if the 
airline were sold. 
</P>
<P>
By 6 a.m. Monday, Ueberroth had the deal with Lorenzo and his deal with the 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
Exhausted but elated, the 30 weary warriors left Shapiro's office to shower and 
head off to the Pan Am shuttle for the flight to New York and a hearing before 
Judge Lifland. 
</P>
<P>
As Ueberroth left the building, he discovered that a tow-truck operator was 
about to haul away the illegally parked car of machinists adviser Randy Barber. 
</P>
<P>
"If I promise to bring major league baseball back to Washington, will you let 
the guy's car go?" Ueberroth asked. The trucker recognized him, smiled, took 
Barber's car off the towing jack and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positive Feelings 
</P>
<P>
It was this sort of gesture, and the positive feelings that the public seemed 
to have about Ueberroth, that made the unions think the partnership could work. 
</P>
<P>
When Ueberroth arrived at the check-in counter for the Pan Am shuttle, the 
ticket agent recognized him and asked: "Why are you leaving baseball?" 
</P>
<P>
"I have 26,000 airline employees to put back to work," responded a smiling 
Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
He wore the same lucky red and gray tie he had on a few months ago when major 
league baseball signed its rich television contract with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was jammed with sleepy bargainers. Ueberroth was cramped between 
machinists leader Charlie Bryan and pilots leader Jack Bavis. Sitting in the 
back row were Shapiro and Carlucci, who was going to be named the trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Or was he? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Script' in Works 
</P>
<P>
One union source said there was "a script" for what was to happen in court, 
including testimony by Bavis, Bryan and flight attendants leader Mary Jane 
Barry that they would not return to work for Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Early that morning, Harvey R. Miller, Eastern's chief bankruptcy attorney, got 
a phone call from Joel Zweibel, lead lawyer for Eastern's 15-member creditors 
committee. Zweibel had just learned about the plan to name a trustee and passed 
the information on to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Miller hit the roof. 
</P>
<P>
A senior partner at New York's Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, Miller, 56, is on 
everyone's list of the nation's top bankruptcy lawyers. He handled the biggest 
one to date -- Texaco's. He is considered so good that if any big company were 
even contemplating bankruptcy they would retain him just to make sure he 
doesn't represent the other side. 
</P>
<P>
And Miller was having no part of a trustee. Indeed, it is quite unusual for a 
trustee to be appointed in a Chapter 11 case. It would amount to wresting 
control of a company away from the owner before it is even sold. There has to 
be a showing of gross mismanagement, fraud or conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some unionists say they heard Lifland tell Shapiro on the telephone over 
the weekend that he would agree to name the trustee. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't bring Frank Carlucci to New York on spec," said a source close to 
Ueberroth. "You bring him because there's a job for him to do." 
</P>
<P>
The source added: "Either Shapiro overestimated Lifland or he underestimated 
Harvey Miller." Another key source says Shapiro was "misled by the court, 
betrayed by the court." Neither Shapiro or Lifland would comment. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Miller made clear to Lifland that if he put a trustee in charge of 
Eastern he would face a lengthy court battle, further delaying Eastern's return 
to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that shocked the unions and Ueberroth, the judge declined to appoint 
a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci, who had expected to be a key player in reviving Eastern, spent the 
day kibitzing with strangers in a courthouse library before being sent home to 
Washington when it became clear that his services would not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
The scramble for a compromise consumed the next 24 hours. Ueberroth was willing 
to drop the trustee idea if he were appointed co-chairman of Eastern in the 
interim, but that didn't satisfy the unions because Lorenzo would retain power. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not go back to work for Frank Lorenzo under any circumstances," 
proclaimed Bavis, chairman of Eastern's pilots union. 
</P>
<P>
While the unions have been criticized for being intractable on the point, they 
were willing to back off on appointment of a trustee if the deal was closed in 
10 days, much quicker than normal. As a practical matter, this would mean that 
Lorenzo would be out before they returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
But Ueberroth wouldn't agree to this proposal, fearing he might discover -- 
after closing the deal in haste -- that Eastern was in worse shape than he knew 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers grew short as the outlook darkened. Lifland attempted to lighten the 
mood by making some popcorn in a machine in his chambers and passing it out to 
the bargainers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disclosure to Press 
</P>
<P>
It was at this unpromising moment that Ueberroth disclosed to the press his 
agreement with the unions of the night before, triggering some unwarranted glee 
among Eastern's work force. In fact, the deal was in perilous condition. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, negotiations resumed the following morning at the Vista 
International Hotel, near the courthouse. At one point Miller suggested to 
Rosenberg, one of Ueberroth's lawyers, that the sale price would be lowered $90 
million if Ueberroth agreed to a quick closing. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Rosenberg came back with a "no" from his client, Miller discovered 
that others had become aware of the offer. Infuriated, he grabbed the much 
smaller Rosenberg by the knot of his necktie, loudly called him a "twerp," and 
told him to never quote him again. 
</P>
<P>
The situation didn't improve once the two sides returned to the courthouse. The 
judge shouted at Miller behind closed doors: "Dammit, Harvey, if you want the 
planes in the air, all you have to do is sign the paper!" 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, as Shapiro tried to get Miller's attention in a courtroom 
hallway, Miller glared at him and declared: "Shove it, David!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stalked Out of Chambers 
</P>
<P>
Early in the evening, Lorenzo arrived for a final session with Ueberroth and 
the judge. But at 9:20 p.m., the normally unflappable Ueberroth stalked out of 
the judge's chambers and refused a plea to return. Lorenzo left separately. An 
arbitrary midnight deadline set by the Lorenzo and Ueberroth camps passed. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes after midnight, one of Ueberroth's associates, reached by phone, 
told The Times, "The deal is dead." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, fruitless talks had resumed at the courthouse when one Willy 
Censor appeared on the 6th floor. A self-described 62-year-old diamond merchant 
with a flowing beard and three children in tow, Censor announced that he wanted 
to buy Eastern and had access to $250 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he would want to buy such a troubled company, he retorted, "Why don't 
you ask Ueberroth that?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the real participants couldn't even agree on whether to hold a news 
conference announcing the collapse of the deal. The judge tried to head it off, 
still hopeful that the sale could be salvaged. Ueberroth said he wouldn't 
participate if Eastern attacked the unions again. The terms were agreed on and 
it took place at the Dorset Hotel on 54th Street. Lorenzo was elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gained 'Greatest Respect' 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth and Phil Bakes, Eastern's president, said nice things about one 
another. Ueberroth said he had gained "the greatest respect" for the union 
leaders. Meanwhile, Eastern security guards had kept union leaders out of the 
press conference and threatened to arrest Barry, the flight attendants leader, 
after she managed to get in. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Ueberroth slowly made his way out of the hotel, shaking hands with 
several union leaders and walking past diamond merchant Censor who was hanging 
around. Outside on the street, strangers shouted greetings at him: "How ya 
doin', Pete?" "Go get 'em Peter!" But as Ueberroth crossed 5th Avenue and 
headed east past a Gucci shop, he knew that unless a miracle occurred he would 
have to find another challenge. Eastern would not be his.

'MOSCOW IS NO LONGER THE BOGYMAN';

<P>
S. AFRICA QUELLS ITS FEARS, WELCOMES SOVIET OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
CAPE TOWN, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, South African leaders have justified their adventurism in black 
Africa and repression at home with a single vision of the future: the day the 
Soviets arrive in battle fatigues and on tanks to run up the red flag over 
Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Soviets did arrive this week, in their first visit since Pretoria 
broke diplomatic ties with Moscow more than three decades ago, they wore 
pinstriped suits, carried briefcases and stepped down from a British Airways 
747. 
</P>
<P>
And the leader of this invasion, Vyacheslav Ustinov, a roving Soviet 
ambassador, was squired around town by grinning government officials and fawned 
over by local reporters like a Hollywood star. 
</P>
<P>
Ustinov and his five-member delegation did not come to restore diplomatic 
relations or even participate in formal talks with South Africa. They were 
here, along with representatives of Cuba, Angola and the United States, for the 
fifth meeting of a commission formed to help guide the Angolan peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets' presence, and the way it has been heralded here, marks a swift 
change in the South African government's public attitude toward the East Bloc. 
And it has provided scenes, some on state-run television, that many white South 
Africans never thought they'd live to see: a Soviet official making a courtesy 
call on President Pieter W. Botha at the executive mansion, Soviet officials at 
a South African wine estate, Soviet officials at a barbecue in the South 
African foreign minister's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"The South African government's rhetoric has changed just in the last six 
months. Moscow is no longer the bogyman," said Willie Esterhuyse, a professor 
of political philosophy at Stellenbosch University. 
</P>
<P>
No detail about the Soviet visitors was too small for the local newspapers. The 
Argus reported that Ustinov was dressed "in shirt sleeves and slippers" during 
an interview in his "five-star" hotel room. "He apologized for his casual 
appearance," the paper added. 
</P>
<P>
Ustinov's thoughts on Cape Town, the seaside home of South Africa's Parliament, 
played well. "It looks like 'Frisco,' " he said, adding that "the streets are 
clean and the beaches are beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labeled 'Total Onslaught' 
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1950s, South Africa has warned the white electorate that its way 
of life was imperiled by a communist-inspired conspiracy to one day rule South 
Africa, which Pretoria labeled the "total onslaught." The government over the 
years has cited the "total onslaught" as justification for sending South 
African soldiers to topple neighboring Marxist countries and to quell what it 
believed were Soviet-backed black uprisings inside the country. 
</P>
<P>
But today the old catch phrase is falling into disuse. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, the Americans -- and especially the Democrats in Congress who 
support sanctions -- are being regarded as the main instigators of the 'total 
onslaught' these days," Esterhuyse said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent thaw in Soviet-South African relations results primarily from 
increasing informal contacts between the two countries arising from the 
U.S.-brokered Angolan peace agreement. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
search for political rather than military solutions to regional conflicts also 
has made the South Africans less suspicious about ulterior Soviet motives. 
</P>
<P>
But the budding relationship also indicates just how far South Africa will go 
to break out of its international isolation, political analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"They're desperate for acceptance from any quarter," a Western diplomat here 
says. "And they're showing America and the West that there's more than one big 
power in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Although the government risks some criticism from conservative whites for 
talking openly with the Soviets, it will gain points among whites who are tired 
of being, in the words of one analyst, "the polecat of the world." 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that there are still some important people who recognize us as a 
regional power," Esterhuyse said. "And all white South Africans, liberals as 
well as conservatives, want to be recognized as a regional power." 
</P>
<P>
South Africa closed the Soviet Embassy here in 1956, accusing the Soviet Union 
of supporting the black liberation movement, particularly the African National 
Congress (ANC). For more than 20 years after that, the government repeatedly 
used the "total onslaught" image to mobilize support among the country's white 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
To counter the onslaught, it devised the "total strategy." It cracked down on 
black opponents at home with ever more restrictive laws and, in the late 1970s, 
funneled support to Rhodesia's white-minority government and the rebel 
movements trying to overthrow the new, Soviet-backed governments in Angola and 
Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, as Pretoria's diplomatic isolation in the West grew, the first 
signs of conciliation with the East appeared. 
</P>
<P>
A little over a year ago, when Radio Moscow began broadcasting to South Africa 
in Afrikaans, the language of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners, white South 
Africans seemed more flattered than fearful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev Book Sold Out 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's book, "Perestroika," was an instant sellout in 1987. And, quietly, 
the Foreign Affairs Ministry resurrected a desk designed to explore relations 
with East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, contacts between the Soviets and South Africans have 
increased. Most of the meetings have been, like the one in Cape Town this week, 
to discuss the progress of the Angolan peace accord and Namibia's steps toward 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha and Anatoly L. Adamishin, the Soviet 
deputy foreign minister for African affairs, met in Mozambique earlier this 
month. Then, a few days later, Adamishin was taken on a 90-minute helicopter 
tour of the Johannesburg area. Western diplomats said it was the first time a 
senior Soviet diplomat had laid eyes on the country in 33 years. He was said by 
South African officials to have been surprised by the modern road network. 
</P>
<P>
While neither side thinks diplomatic relations will be restored any time soon, 
South African officials hope they can persuade the Soviet Union to put pressure 
on its friend, the ANC, to end the guerrilla war against Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviets recently said they favor a political settlement in South 
Africa, they have been reluctant to get too close to the South African 
government for fear it would alienate the ANC and their other friends in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Ustinov told reporters this week that the Soviet Union would not even consider 
renewing formal ties with Pretoria until apartheid is dismantled. But, he 
added, the Soviet Union would be happy to help South Africa end its system of 
racial segregation "if you ask us to."

CHENEY PREDICTS GORBACHEV WILL FAIL, BE OUSTED

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a striking departure from official U.S. 
policy, predicted Friday that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will fail 
in his reform efforts and be replaced by a hard-liner who will be "far more 
hostile" to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief said Gorbachev faces an entrenched, conservative Soviet 
bureaucracy that ultimately will thwart his policies and drive him from office. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal view is that the task that he set for himself of trying to 
fundamentally reform the Soviet system is incapable of occurring," Cheney said 
in an interview taped Friday and to be aired today on CNN's "Evans &amp; Novak" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Far More Hostile' 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to guess today, I would guess that he would ultimately fail," Cheney 
said. "That is to say that he will not be able to reform the Soviet economy to 
turn it into an efficient, modern society. And that when that happens, he's 
likely to be replaced by somebody who will be far more hostile than he's been 
in terms of his attitude towards the West." 
</P>
<P>
Official Administration policy is that Gorbachev is firmly in control of the 
Soviet government despite some internal opposition and will continue to be the 
nation's leader for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's purge of 110 members of the policy-making Central Committee and the 
Central Auditing Commission this week was interpreted by American analysts as 
further evidence of his consolidating power by removing hard-line elements in 
the Soviet bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
No senior U.S. official had predicted publicly that Gorbachev would be forced 
from office by conservative opponents. 
</P>
<P>
A Cheney aide explained that the defense secretary's comments were "personal 
opinions" and not U.S. government policy. The State Department referred 
questions on the incident to the Pentagon, where a spokesman said that Cheney's 
responses were "guesswork, not a considered statement of policy." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not inconsistent with what Cheney has been saying," chief Pentagon 
spokesman Dan Howard said. "He was asked his personal opinion. This is not a 
completely unfounded notion. It's a guess based on 70 years of experience with 
Soviet leadership and the almost intractable economic problems and the 
intransigent bureaucracy Mr. Gorbachev has to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney used the prediction to justify his position that U.S. troop levels in 
Europe should not be cut in response to promised reductions in Soviet military 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that would be a big mistake," he said. "I think it would undo basic 
commitments to the (Western) alliance, and until we know that Gorbachev is for 
real and that the changes he wants to bring about are irreversible, it'd be a 
terrible mistake for us to withdraw from Europe." 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that he believes that the Western European nations should pay 
a greater share of the costs of defending Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to work to try to get the Europeans to do more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On a related matter, Cheney said that a widening German-American rift over 
whether to negotiate the removal of short-range nuclear weapons from West 
Germany might not be resolved by the time of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization summit conference at the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been through this kind of thing before . . .," Cheney said. "Clearly the 
political situation in Germany today is a delicate one from (West German 
Chancellor Helmut) Kohl's standpoint. Will it be resolved before the NATO 
summit? I don't know. It may be. On the other hand, it may not get resolved for 
a while."

ISRAELI PROBERS SAY BORDER POLICE USED 'EXCESSIVE FIRE' IN ARAB RAID 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that "excessive fire" was used in a recent raid on the West Bank village 
of Nahhalin, in which five Arabs were shot to death, an Israeli army 
investigation is putting the blame for the incident on two border police 
officers in charge of the raid and an intelligence officer who planned it, 
military sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The army report specifically denied that the killings were planned or that a 
massacre occurred. The two commanding officers lost control of the situation, 
and the unit was not adequately prepared by the intelligence officer to enter 
the combative village, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers responded with rifle fire when they came under attack from 
stone-throwing youths, the investigation concluded. The border police expended 
their supply of rubber and plastic bullets before turning to lead-tipped 
rounds, the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were given to Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the military chief of staff, 
on Thursday by Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the West Bank military commander, an 
army spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Report Due 
</P>
<P>
"The mechanics are done; what has to be decided is the disciplinary action, the 
spokesman said. The final report is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Nahhalin raid, designed according to army officials to arrest stone 
throwers, occurred before dawn on April 13. The one-day toll of fatalities at 
the village, which is located in a valley near Bethlehem, was the highest of 
the year and the second highest at a single place during the Arab uprising, 
which is now in its 17th month. 
</P>
<P>
Israel came under international criticism for the killings; the International 
Red Cross took the unusual step of openly condemning the raid, accusing the 
border police of firing indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Defended 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Shomron defended the actions of the border police, saying the 
responsibility for the high death count rested mainly with the village 
residents themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Those killed there, and also the casualties sustained by the border police are 
first and foremost a result of real violence, which was used against the border 
police," he said. "The source of this entire incident . . . is primarily the 
result of this violence." 
</P>
<P>
Three border policemen were slightly injured by stones, the army reported. 
Besides the five killed, about 20 Arabs were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Nahhalin deaths renewed a controversy over Israel's tactics in battling the 
intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic, as well as the use of the border 
police, who some critics in Israel accuse of using brutal methods. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Israeli troops have been entering villages late at night, 
especially in the Bethlehem area, for the express purpose of detaining 
suspected stone throwers. When the soldiers and police enter the villages, they 
use loudspeakers to call for the sleeping residents to gather outside for their 
identification cards to be checked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Windows Broken 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, troops have broken windows of houses and cars and shot up 
cisterns, saying that they were responding to hails of thrown stones. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports on Nahhalin said that a contingent of 30 border policemen 
had to fight its way into the village. Four of the dead were killed in the 
center of Nahhalin near the mosque. Residents of the village reported a sniper 
shooting randomly from a second story balcony of a half-finished house across 
from the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
At least two dogs and a donkey were also killed. Several homes along the 
entrance to the village were pockmarked with bullet holes. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,500-member strong border police, which normally patrols the country's 
frontier, nominally reports to the Israeli Police Ministry, although its 
activities in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip are under control of the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Troops Withdraw 
</P>
<P>
Army sources said that a reinforcement team of regular army troops that entered 
the village got into a dispute with the border police, who were demanding more 
ammunition from them. A shoving match broke out and the regular soldiers 
withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli army rules of engagement, the use of lead bullets is limited to 
situations of "clear and present danger to life," Brig. Gen. Amnon Straschnow 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic bullets, dangerous at a shorter range, "are not aimed to be lethal," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"In all cases, it very much depends on the circumstances," said Straschnow, who 
declined to comment on the border police case specifically. 
</P>
<P>
The Nahhalin incident was especially notable at the time because it coincided 
with the end of a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to Washington. 
Officials of the Bush Administration had indicated a desire that Israel and the 
Palestinians begin a period of "confidence building" to lead up to peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Level of Violence 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the Nahhalin violence, the intifada entered one of its most 
violent phases, with a sharp increase in Palestinian casualties. Since April 
13, 20 Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers. Arabs, meanwhile, have 
killed at least 10 other Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli 
authorities, including one who was beaten to death in Nablus on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Armed Israeli settlers have also raided several Arab villages to retaliate for 
incidents of stones being thrown at their vehicles as they drive along highways 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The raiding settlers have broken windows and 
shot cisterns, retreating when Israelis soldiers arrive to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Palestinians clashed with troops and Jewish settlers in Hebron, 
Nablus and Gaza, leaving at least eight Arabs wounded. In Jerusalem, a car 
exploded outside police headquarters, seriously wounding the Palestinian 
driver, who police said may have been trying to plant a booby-trapped bomb. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15,000 at Mosque 
</P>
<P>
And in Jerusalem, about 15,000 Muslims prayed at the Al Aqsa Mosque in the old 
city under the surveillance of a police helicopter, with hundreds of 
riot-equipped police officers stationed outside Temple Mount. There was no 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
But police turned away hundreds of young Palestinians from the mosque, which 
was the scene of a riot April 7 when several Jewish worshipers were injured at 
the nearby Western Wall by stone-throwing Palestinians.

WOULD EMPHASIZE EVILS OF APARTHEID; 
</P>
<P>
POPE HINTS HE MAY VISIT SOUTH AFRICA

ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, starting his fifth trip to Africa as Pope, raised the 
possibility Friday of a formal visit to South Africa sometime in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of a papal visit to South African came up at a press conference on 
the Pope's flight from Rome to Madagascar, an island nation of more than 2 
million Roman Catholics, the first of four stops in nine days. 
</P>
<P>
Among the stops is Lusaka, Zambia, headquarters of the anti-apartheid African 
National Congress, where the pontiff is expected to make a powerful 
denunciation of apartheid. The racial separation policy in South Africa is an 
important obstacle to a papal visit, he indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking sociopolitically," the Pope said, "we all know very well what the 
moral problems are in this sphere in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Directed at Leaders 
</P>
<P>
But he added that papal visits are directed at Catholics, not necessarily their 
leaders, and he suggested that he would make the evil of apartheid the theme of 
any visit to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope must be respected in his role as someone who tells the truth," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican officials said later that John Paul expects to make two further trips 
to Africa in the next year, and a stop in South Africa could be included. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks en route to Madagascar, the pontiff also made one of his 
strongest statements yet on another subject he is likely to take up during this 
trip -- AIDS. He said that AIDS, which in the West generally strikes 
homosexuals and intravenous drug users but in Africa is largely a problem for 
heterosexuals, is something that reflects the decline in the moral order of the 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a case of personal blame in each instance," he said, "but many times 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIDS Affects Up to 20% 
</P>
<P>
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is estimated to affect up to 20% 
of the people of Zambia and Malawi, his two final stops on this trip. Among the 
more prominent victims is the son of Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope also said he might meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
when Gorbachev travels to Italy in November. Such a meeting would be the first 
between the Pope and a Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pontiff's arrival in Madagascar placed him squarely in the 
middle of a developing political maelstrom. He landed amid a "papal truce" 
called by opposition parties whose contention that last month's presidential 
election here was rigged has led to riots that left six dead and 74 injured 
last week in downtown Antananarivo. 
</P>
<P>
The election, which was overseen by a committee of churches, including the 
Catholic Church, gave President Didier Ratsiraka his third seven-year term with 
62.7% of the vote, his smallest margin ever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foes Charged Fraud 
</P>
<P>
The opposition complained of widespread fraud and of an electoral code that 
allowed Ratsiraka to schedule the vote during the rainy season, when only he 
could reach remote rural districts to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
At one point the government hinted that unless the opposition halted public 
demonstrations, it might be forced to cancel the Pope's visit. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, led by Manandafy Rakotonarina, a key figure in the 1972 
revolution that drove out the colonial French, promptly declared a treve, or 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
"No politician wanted to take responsibility for the cancellation of the 
visit," a diplomat in the capital said. 
</P>
<P>
On greeting John Paul at Antananarivo's Ivato airport Friday evening, the 
Jesuit-educated Ratsiraka laced into the opposition, charging them with 
fomenting "anarchy and political bad faith." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope listened impassively from his seat in the airport's VIP lounge. In his 
response, he made no allusion to Madagascar politics. 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar's Catholics, about 20% of the population, are slightly outnumbered 
by Protestants and overwhelmed by the 55% who profess belief in animism and a 
mystical brand of ancestor worship. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborate tombs adorn the countryside, and the streets are often blocked by 
processions of carts carrying coffins. These are not exactly funerals, but 
rites in which the bodies of the dead are exhumed at regular intervals, 
reclothed, and led around the neighborhood to reacquaint the dead with the 
living. The Malagasy people often make decisions based on what they gather to 
be their ancestors' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church here long ago came to terms with these beliefs. One 
prominent Malagasy noted that priests, far from objecting to such rites, "often 
themselves preside at the ceremonies. They coexist very comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Catholics have often had an unhappy relationship with the 
country's rulers and nationalists. Four priests were killed last year by what 
are thought to be political groups. Three were killed the year before, among 
them an Italian priest who was beheaded by a nationalist youth group that was 
later disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
The killings were discomfiting echoes of trying times in the past. These 
included a period in the 19th Century when a Malagasy queen had Catholics flung 
off the cliff behind her palace, the peaked black roof of which rises over the 
site of several events scheduled in connection with the papal visit. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ratsiraka is trying harder to appeal to Catholic leaders, as he is to 
other Western powers. Press censorship has been lifted for the most part, and 
opposition candidates were permitted to wage unusually energetic presidential 
campaigns last month. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the president appears to be trying to reverse more than a decade 
of economic decline here by shifting his economic policies from a brand of 
socialism to Western-style free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE POPE IN AFRICA 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Pope John Paul II arrived in Madagascar on Friday, the first stop in a 
9-day African tour. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- May 1-2. The Pope will make an overnight call at the French island of La 
Reunion in the Indian Ocean. There he will beatify a 19th-Century holy woman 
and meet with French Premier Michel Rocard. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- May 2-4. The Pope will be in copper-rich Zambia, where per capita income 
among the 6.7 million people is less than $500 a year and the economy is 
stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- May 4 -- Malawi, the Pope's last stop before returning to Rome, is, like 
Madagascar and Zambia, about 25% Catholic, but its president is an elder of the 
Church of Scotland. Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda has led Malawi since independence from 
Britain in 1964. The average Malawian earns only about $200 a year.

A noon cease-fire called by the Arab League held Friday, but the issue that 
sparked weeks of brutal artillery battles remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum Crossing linking Muslim West Beirut and Christian East Beirut 
reopened. All front lines were reported calm. 
</P>
<P>
But the two sides remained at odds over Christian army commander Michel Aoun's 
continued blockade of ports. 
</P>
<P>
A few people walked across the line in both directions for the first time since 
March 21, when Syrian troops and their Lebanese Muslim allies laid siege to the 
Christian heartland by closing all crossings in response to the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese who have seen hundreds of abortive cease-fires in the 14 years of 
civil war were skeptical and most stayed indoors.

JAPAN'S RULING PARTY IGNORES FOES, OKS BUDGET

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party overrode an opposition boycott Friday to 
ensure final enactment of Japan's budget by May 28, raising confrontation in 
Parliament to a new peak. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the prospects for swift selection of a successor to outgoing 
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita grew more clouded as the consensus choice, 
Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the party's Executive Board, called a news 
conference to reiterate his refusal to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling conservatives rammed the budget for the 1989 fiscal year that began 
April 1 through the House of Representatives, fixing May 28 or shortly 
thereafter as a deadline for Takeshita to submit an official resignation. The 
prime minister repeated Friday his Tuesday declaration that he would resign 
after the budget is enacted because of his implication in the Recruit Co. 
influence-peddling scandal.

<P>
Effective Automatically 
</P>
<P>
Although the budget was sent to the House of Councilors, a constitutional 
provision ensures that it will go into effect automatically 30 days from now 
even without a vote in the ceremonial upper house. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the lower house had ever passed the budget without 
any opposition party members attending. 
</P>
<P>
Struggling through mobs of shouting opposition members who tried unsuccessfully 
to block his passage, Speaker Kenzaburo Hara made his way to the main chamber 
of the lower house with the help of parliamentary guards. After a pro forma 
12-minute committee report, 281 representatives voted for the budget. 
</P>
<P>
One unaffiliated member cast a negative vote and another unaffiliated member 
voted for the budget. Three ruling party members said they stayed away to 
express their disapproval of the unilateral action and 13 other members were 
also absent. The ruling party holds 296 seats in the 512-member chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders charged that the unilateral vote was designed to cover up 
details of the scandal focused on Recruit, an information and real estate 
conglomerate accused of trying to buy influence with political contributions 
and stock profits. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita, who received $1.12 million in stock profits and contributions from 
the firm, said he was resigning to assume responsibility for the scandal. 
Opposition parties, however, continued to insist that former Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone be forced to testify under oath about profits his aides made 
from insider trading in stocks of a Recruit subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's decision to assume responsibility for the scandal represented the 
limit of concessions that the ruling party was willing to offer the opposition 
to end its eight-week boycott, conservative leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Socialist Party, the main opposition party, said 
it would "continue fighting until the lower house is dissolved for a general 
election." 
</P>
<P>
Socialist Shinnen Tagaya, deputy speaker of the lower house, resigned the 
chamber's No. 2 post in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming responsibility for the confrontation, Toshio Yamaguchi, the Liberal 
Democrats' lower house steering committee chairman, also resigned, a lead that 
Hara, the Speaker, was expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ito, the man who ruling party leaders, including Takeshita, 
reportedly had agreed should lead the party and the nation, rejected a request 
by Shintaro Abe, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, that he succeed 
Takeshita. 
</P>
<P>
Ito told reporters after meeting Abe that his "resolve to decline the offer is 
extremely strong." 
</P>
<P>
"If I became (the leader), it would lead to a situation creating trouble for 
both the party and the nation," Ito, 75, said in what appeared to be a 
reference to his health. He suffers from diabetes and reportedly has also 
developed heart trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"A young person should be chosen to carry out political reforms. I won't do 
it," he had said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The former foreign minister also complained about moves to select a new lineup 
of party and Cabinet officials before the selection of a new party president, 
who will become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Those moves, "although an insult (to the new leader), are not the reason for my 
refusal," he said Friday. "I said I would decline even before personnel moves 
began." 
</P>
<P>
Ito said the party also should firm up a commitment to political reform before 
selecting Takeshita's successor. 
</P>
<P>
Ito and Abe, however, agreed to Takeshita's request for a suspension in 
selection activity until after Takeshita returns May 7 from a nine-day trip to 
five Southeast Asian nations. He is to leave this afternoon for his first stop, 
Bangkok, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts remained divided over whether Ito will ultimately reject a formal 
request, which would come from Takeshita himself. But they noted that Ito, who 
has a reputation for standing by his word, has repeated his disavowals for four 
straight days. 
</P>
<P>
If Ito sticks to his refusal, the ruling party faces a succession crisis. All 
of its major leaders have been tainted by the Recruit scandal, and the only 
other untainted "dark horse" available, Masaharu Gotoda, is reported to be 
unpopular among fellow conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Gotoda also has rejected suggestions that he replace Takeshita.

MEDVEDEV DUMPED IN '69; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET PARTY REINSTATES ANTI-STALINIST HISTORIAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Roy A. Medvedev, a leading Soviet historian who was expelled from the Communist 
Party 20 years ago for exposing the extent of the dictator Josef Stalin's 
crimes, has been fully exonerated and reinstated as a party member, the 
official Tass news agency reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The party's control committee, which reviewed Medvedev's case, for years a 
focus of controversy, "concluded that he had been expelled from the party 
without grounds," Tass said. The committee reinstated him as a member since 
1959, the year he was originally admitted as a full member. 
</P>
<P>
His expulsion in 1969, Tass said, was due largely to his book, "Let History 
Judge," on the nature and consequences of Stalin's rule, particularly his 
personality cult, and the resulting distortions of socialism in the Soviet 
Union. A seminal study of Stalinism, the book has recently been serialized 
here, and it will soon be published in full, 18 years after it appeared in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev's rehabilitation could signal a series of important political shifts 
here -- a new willingness of the Soviet leadership to acknowledge not only 
Stalin's misdeeds but its own mistaken efforts to cover them up, a further 
outreach to those whose principles turned them into dissidents in the 1960s and 
1970s and an acceptance of the people's judgment in electing men like Medvedev 
to the new Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not changed my views," Medvedev said Friday. "The turnabout occurred in 
the party, in the Central Committee." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Up to Party 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, he said, senior party officials asked if he wanted to 
become a member again. Such a decision was up to the party, he replied, for he 
had not resigned but been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me how I would react if I were reinstated," Medvedev recalled, "and 
I said, quite honestly, that I would not object, for I was and have remained a 
Marxist, and I fully share the goals of the party today." 
</P>
<P>
After two decades in the wilderness, when he a "nonperson" in the Soviet 
parlance of the time and could only publish his work abroad, Medvedev has 
within the past year emerged as a major political figure, well within the 
mainstream of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies earlier this month after 
defeating five other candidates in a key Moscow district. He is now interviewed 
regularly by Soviet news media on historical questions and current events, and 
his long suppressed books on Stalin and the devastating effects of his rule are 
being published here. And he again lectures on his specialty -- leadership 
politics in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"After so many years as a supposed heretic, it is hard sometimes to understand 
that what I hold, and have always held, is now the new credo," Medvedev, 63, 
said in a recent conversation in his book-filled apartment. "But I am ready to 
contribute in any way I can. After calling for democracy for so long, I have no 
choice but to do what I can and what those who have supported me want . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Rehabilitation is, quite naturally, very satisfying for me, but it is very, 
very important in the larger context, in its implications for the official 
attitudes to such questions as Stalin's crimes and the long-term effects of his 
personality cult and simply for the way that politics are conducted here." 
</P>
<P>
The silver-haired Medvedev has retained his ironic sense of humor and bemused 
view of the world. To old friends, who recall the policemen who used to sit at 
his front door, he jokes, "I am sorry I no longer have a doorman" as he 
welcomes them -- and ushers out a government film crew that had been taping his 
comments on Stalin for an official documentary. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev, criticism of Stalin and his crimes no longer is dissent, or 
"anti-Soviet propaganda," as it was called when people were imprisoned for it. 
But the party's official position, and Medvedev's scholarly works, more than 
two dozen books, appear with their tempered judgments likely to become the 
starting point for the next evaluation of Stalin, who died in 1953 but with 
whose legacy the country is still grappling. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev has estimated that 40 million Soviet citizens were either killed, 
arrested or otherwise repressed under Stalin, and his figures, along with his 
remarks about Stalin, have been published in the official Soviet press. 
</P>
<P>
Like many others of his generation, Medvedev brought a personal perspective to 
the question. In 1938, when he was 12, his father, Alexander, a Communist Party 
professor of philosophy and middle-grade army officer, was arrested and 
convicted on false charges and sent to an Arctic labor camp, where he died in 
1941; he was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956 after Stalin's death. 
</P>
<P>
His twin brother, Zhores, a biochemist and gerontologist, was stripped of his 
Soviet citizenship and effectively exiled while traveling abroad in 1973. 
Zhores had been forcibly committed to a psychiatric hospital for circulating 
his book, "The Rise and Fall of T. D. Lysenko," about the corruption of Soviet 
science under Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Political Diary' 
</P>
<P>
Released after a massive campaign within the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the 
broader intellectual community, Zhores became Roy's closest collaborator in a 
series of dissident activities, including publication of an important 
underground newsletter, "Political Diary." He now lives in London. 
</P>
<P>
Among the leading Soviet dissidents of the 1970s, Roy Medvedev took a different 
stance from that of Andrei D. Sakharov, the nuclear physicist, who won the 1975 
Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights activities, and Alexander I. 
Solzhenitsyn, the exiled Russian writer and the 1970 Nobel laureate for 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
While protesting the party's abuse of power at home and abroad, he advocated a 
liberal, reformed, more human Marxism, closer to the democratic socialism of 
Western Europe and its multiparty systems. Perestroika, as Gorbachev's reform 
program is known, has already gone further, he says, than the goals he outlined 
in a 1970 program of his own.

The Soviet Union has a poor record on combatting pollution but plans to double 
environmental spending and sharply cut harmful emissions over northern Europe, 
the Soviet environmental protection minister said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Signing a five-year environmental cooperation agreement with Sweden, Fyodor T. 
Morgun sharply criticized his country's past record in the ecological field. 
</P>
<P>
"We criticize ourselves because many European countries and the United States 
allocate twice as much money as we did and do in the Soviet Union to the 
environment," Morgun told a news conference. "But the time has come and the 
government has taken the decision that sufficient funds will be allocated -- 
double what we spend now."

31 TANKS SENT TO PANZER GRAVEYARD; 
</P>
<P>
EAST GERMANY BEGINS MILITARY CUTBACK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chill, biting wind whipped across the parade ground of the 8th Panzer 
Regiment here Friday as soldiers stood stiffly in formation. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the regiment of several hundred men wore the field-gray uniform of the 
East German army. The rest -- 127 of them -- wore jackets, jeans, sneakers and 
"goodby" kerchiefs. These were draftees who had completed their 18 months of 
service and were being discharged at this post, 90 miles northwest of divided 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
As East German generals went out of the way to emphasize, the men being 
discharged are not being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
This means that as the conscripts are phased out, so too will be the 8th Panzer 
Regiment, which was created in 1956 and is to be disbanded by October. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 miles away, on a railroad siding in a pine forest on the North German 
Plain, a battalion of 31 tanks was moved onto flatcars of a train that later 
headed south. The aging bottle-green T-55s were destined for a panzer graveyard 
at Ostritz near the Polish border, where according to senior officers here, 
they are to be scrapped or cannibalized for parts or converted to coal mining 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Difficult' for Commander 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for me personally to give them up," said Maj. Manfred 
Wuelferling, the battalion's 37-year-old commander, who wore panzer-black 
coveralls. "A great part of my life has been spent with them." 
</P>
<P>
As the battalion was retired, similar scenes were taking place in five other 
panzer regiments Friday, according to East German officers. 
</P>
<P>
This was the well-publicized start of East Germany's unilateral move to reduce 
its armed forces, now 176,000 strong, by 10,000 troops and 600 tanks by the end 
of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is unprecedented in the history of the East German army," Lt. Gen. Horst 
Syllar, commander of the regional military district, said of the move. 
</P>
<P>
He said that some front-line divisions, deprived of a tank regiment, would be 
transformed step by step into more "defensive operations." 
</P>
<P>
Staff officers confirmed that divisional formations will have to be 
restructured, but they did not spell out how. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guarding Invasion Route 
</P>
<P>
The tanks being retired Friday were taken from the 1st Motor Rifle Division, 
which is based near Schwerin and guards parts of the plain that stretches from 
the Soviet Union to the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
The plain, dotted with red-brick farmhouses and black-and-white dairy cattle, 
is classic tank country. In the view of military analysts, it would be the main 
route of any Soviet advance, through Poland, into Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Military experts believe that any incursion by the Warsaw Pact powers would be 
aimed at reaching the Rhine River and the Low Countries -- Belgium, Luxembourg 
and The Netherlands -- while cutting off Denmark in the north and outflanking 
the U.S. 7th Army to the south. 
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the fact that the East Germans are disbanding an armored 
regiment plus an air wing, rather than, say, an infantry unit, is seen in the 
West as a hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
"It is armor capability that the Western Alliance has considered most 
dangerous," a North Atlantic Treaty Organization official said. "So this is 
certainly a positive move on the part of the East Germans." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's force reduction is scheduled to be followed May 5 by the withdrawal of 
some Soviet forces from East Germany. The Soviets are working on a timetable 
set out by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a speech to the United Nations 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Soviet forces in Warsaw Pact countries are stationed in East 
Germany, a total of 380,000 troops. Gorbachev said his government would 
withdraw about 5,000 tanks and 50,000 troops from East Germany, Czechoslovakia, 
and Hungary by the end of next year. Last week, a battalion of 31 tanks was 
loaded onto a train at Kiskunhalas in Hungary and moved off toward the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the West knows for certain whether the forces that the Communist 
governments say they are disbanding will actually disappear from the order of 
battle, or whether they will turn up again another day. But as one Western 
observer said Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the East Germans are serious. After all, these tanks are 20 years old 
and ready for the scrap heap anyway. The East German economy is short of young 
workers. They badly need the manpower." 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. diplomat added, "I think this is probably the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
An East German official said Friday that about 11,500 new conscripts are being 
diverted to civilian tasks after only three months of basic training. He said 
they will work at civilian jobs for the remaining 15 months of their compulsory 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Although most NATO officials praised the reductions, one said, "They still have 
a lot of cutting to do before we are anywhere near parity in tanks." 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact reductions are calculated to appeal to West Germans and other 
Europeans. Yet, Michael Broer, of the Bonn-based Foreign Policy Institute, 
commented: "Sure, the Soviets are trying to use this for propaganda purposes. 
But there's substance here as well." 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts speculated that the cuts are bound to be popular in Western 
Europe and will further roil the argument in NATO over new arms control 
measures.

JACKSON DISCUSSES RUNNING FOR MAYOR IN CAPITAL

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson has begun active discussion of running for mayor in the 
District of Columbia next year, a step that would in all likelihood take him 
out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson told the Washington Post on Friday: "I have not yet made a 
determination to run here," but he said that he is speeding planned remodeling 
work on a home he owns in Washington and may move here from Chicago as soon as 
it is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Several Jackson advisers told the Post that in private conversations in the 
last two weeks he has indicated a strong inclination to skip the 1992 
presidential battle and seek elective office in Washington -- a decision that 
would drastically alter the national and local political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact on Would-Be Candidates 
</P>
<P>
It would open the 1992 nomination fight by removing from contention one of the 
most exciting and controversial figures in the Democratic Party. At the same 
time, it would likely cause all those eyeing the job now held by embattled 
three-term Mayor Marion Barry to re-evaluate their plans. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said flatly: "I will not run against Marion Barry," and Jackson 
advisers told the Post that Jackson is encouraging efforts to find a business 
or academic post to which Barry could retire at the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said in a statement Friday that "from all indications I have received, 
the Rev. Jackson is not interested in running for mayor of Washington, D.C., 
regardless of whether I run or not." 
</P>
<P>
Key figures in past Jackson presidential campaigns said that in recent 
conversations, Jackson has expressed the view to them that it would be a 
mistake for him to seek the party nomination again in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Three-Time Loser 
</P>
<P>
"He realizes that he could -- and probably would -- end up a three-time loser 
at age 51," said one man, "and that would be the end of his national 
prospects." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson disclaimed that thinking, and said it was "speculative and premature" 
to conclude that he would seek to succeed Barry. But he pointedly noted that "I 
have worked here (Washington) as much as I have in Chicago."

In an impassioned plea that the judge deny bail, Assistant Manhattan Dist. 
Atty. Elizabeth Lederer said: "They left a trail of ruin, assault and injury. . 
. . . As a result of their rampage, a 28-year-old woman is lying unconscious in 
Metropolitan Hospital. She was raped, sodomized, brutally beaten and then left 
bleeding for hours in the thickest woods." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing for one of the youths, age 17, was interrupted when black activist 
attorney Alton Maddox Jr. violated an agreement that he remain silent as the 
youth's attorney, Joseph Mack, spoke to State Supreme Court Justice Carol 
Berkman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told to Join Spectators 
</P>
<P>
When he persisted in trying to speak, the judge ordered Maddox to join the 
spectators behind the courtroom rail. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a bunch of racists! This is a kangaroo court!" two dozen black 
supporters led by the Rev. Al Sharpton shouted. They surged forward as a dozen 
court officers rushed to form a human wall at the rail. Berkman left the bench 
and returned only after the group followed Maddox's instructions to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox and Mack then wheeled and stormed from the courtroom with their 
supporters in tow. When they returned about an hour later, the judge denied 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox and Sharpton also were active in the case of Tawana Brawley, a black 
teen-ager who told a tale last year of abduction, rape and abuse but whose 
story has been doubted by many. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, prosecutors revealed a grand jury indictment had been 
returned against another of the alleged attackers, age 14. The junior high 
student is the sixth to be indicted for the attack on the woman April 19 and 
the only one who admitted raping her, a police complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
Another youth, age 15, was indicted for allegedly beating and robbing a 
40-year-old male jogger during the same two-hour rampage through the park. He 
was held on $15,000 bail.

BUSH, QUAYLE HAVE AGREED ON DETAILS FOR A SUCCESSION 
</P>

President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle reached an agreement at a private 
meeting earlier this month on conditions under which the vice president would 
become acting President if Bush became incapacitated, White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush was in "excellent health," and "there is no expectation of 
having to use these procedures." But he said the issue of succession was raised 
"to make sure all those involved in this process are aware of the procedures, 
and that everyone was aware of the consultations that would have to be made." 
</P>
<P>
He said the President and vice president were joined by First Lady Barbara 
Bush, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, White House counsel C. Boyden 
Gray and Burton Lee II, the President's physician. A representative of the 
Secret Service and Susan Porter Rose, Mrs. Bush's chief of staff, also 
attended, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute meeting, which was kept off Bush's public schedule, was held on 
April 18, he said. The existence of the meeting was disclosed in a Washington 
Post story Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure for determining when a vice president should step in for an 
incapacitated President is addressed in the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which was ratified in 1967. But there has been concern about gray areas, 
illustrated by Woodrow Wilson's continued service after he was incapacitated by 
a stroke in the final year of his presidency, and the confusion that enveloped 
the White House immediately after President Ronald Reagan was shot eight years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the meeting resulted in "no document, no guidelines, no 
implementation orders of any kind," and that no special agreement was reached 
between the President and vice president. Rather, Bush, Quayle and the others 
reviewed the procedures that would be followed -- "who had to do what" -- 
should Bush become incapacitated and unable to instruct Quayle to take over as 
acting President. 
</P>
<P>
The 25th Amendment specifies that in such circumstances, the vice president and 
a majority of the Cabinet would declare in writing that the President is unable 
to carry out his duties, and the vice president would become acting President.

FLIGHTS OF 'STEALTH' PLANES SPOTTED IN DESERT

Sharp-eyed observers have spotted flocks of the Air Force's most secret fighter 
jets flying over Southern California in recent weeks, providing the first 
in-flight glimpses of an aircraft that has remained shrouded in mystery for 
more than 10 years, according to an authoritative defense industry magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of 10 F-117 "stealth" fighter jets have been seen during daylight hours 
streaking over Mojave, a small town outside Edwards Air Force Base about 90 
miles north of Los Angeles, Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in its 
May 1 issue. 
</P>
<P>
After flying the F-117 for five years, the Air Force last November unveiled the 
aircraft to the public for the first time. The plane uses special designs and 
materials to elude detection by radar. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the service said it wanted to begin daytime flights of the 
bat-like warplane and acknowledged that such training flights would lead to 
sightings by civilians. Until recently, the Air Force had been flying the 
aircraft under cover of night in an effort to keep details of the plane a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force, which has remained secretive about most details of the plane, 
said Friday that it would not discuss operational matters regarding the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
While the nation's 52-plane force of the stealth fighters is based at Tonopah 
Test Range Airfield in Nevada, the latest round of training flights appears to 
be conducted at Edwards Air Force Base and nearby test ranges in the Mojave 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation Week noted that Edwards Air Force Base traditionally has been used as 
a flying range for experimental planes, rather than as a training site for 
planes already in the force. Practice runs involving 10 aircraft, such as those 
observed on April 12 and 18, are rare in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Overflights of the aircraft have revealed to area residents one its most 
distinctive characteristics -- the faint, high-pitched whine of two engines as 
the jet passes overhead at speeds just below the speed of sound. "This sound 
was definitely different," one observer told the magazine. "There was no doubt 
this was something we hadn't heard before. It even set the dogs off before we 
heard it." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Corp. is to build a total of 59 F-117s at its experimental "skunk 
works" facility in Palmdale.

3 CHINESE WOMEN HELD CAPTIVE FREED

Three young Chinese women were freed from a Sunset District home where they 
allegedly were forced to do domestic labor and live in the basement with no 
contact with the outside world, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
John Majka, chief investigator for the San Francisco district attorney's 
office, said the women appeared healthy and in good spirits when FBI and 
immigration officials took them from the modest 22nd Avenue flat where they had 
been living. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation indicated that the women, ages 14, 19 and 20, had 
been recruited in China to study dance at a fictitious school called the San 
Francisco College of Music and Theater Arts and live in dormitories, Majka 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One woman had been at the home almost a year and another since October, he 
said. Officials were not sure how long the third had been there. 
</P>
<P>
The women, who had no money and no place to go, were placed in protective 
custody at a "safe location" pending outcome of the investigation, Majka said. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said they were unsure of the 
women's immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowner was identified only as a Chinese man. Because many of the 
documents seized at the home were in Chinese, Majka said.

EX-ARGENTINE GENERAL ORDERED TO PAY $60 MILLION 
</P>

A federal judge ordered former Argentine Gen. Carlos Suarez Mason to pay $60 
million to the families of three men who were killed during the Argentine 
military's rule of that country, lawyers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John Vukasin made the award on April 11 after finding that 
Suarez Mason would not defend himself against charges that he oversaw military 
police who carried out the torture-killings. 
</P>
<P>
The award is among the largest in a case alleging human rights violations 
committed in another country, and the second against Suarez Mason. Lawyers for 
the Argentine nationals who have won the judgments believe Suarez Mason has 
hidden wealth, but none has been found. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking for it," said Juan Mendez of Americas Watch, a lawyer for 
the Argentine nationals. "We have some clues, but at this point, no more than 
clues. We needed the judgments. Without the judgments, we could not use the 
judicial system to find out where it is." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. courts claimed jurisdiction over Suarez Mason because he fled to here in 
1983 after the civilian government of Raul Alfonsin took over in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
At Argentina's request, Suarez Mason was arrested in suburban Foster City in 
1987 and deported last May. He is awaiting trial in Buenos Aires, charged with 
39 murders committed during the military rule of that country. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest order, Vukasin directed Suarez Mason to pay the $60 million to 
Susana Quiros de Rapaport, 40, and Maria Teresa Pinero de Georgiadis, 40, of 
Argentina, and Maria Elena Perez de Antonanzas, 75, and her daughter, Norma 
Antonanzas de Barroso, 43, who are living in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Rapaport's husband, an architect, was arrested near Buenos Aires on Aug. 5, 
1975, and died in early 1977. De Georgiadis' husband was arrested July 16, 
1975, on charges of being a subversive and also died in early 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The Antonanzases are the mother and sister of Nestor Ruben Antonanzas, who 
disappeared April 21, 1977. Maria Elena Perez de Antonanzas received a telegram 
in 1984 saying her son died in prison June 26, 1977.

2 BOYS, 8 AND 9, HELD IN MAJOR BLAZE AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two boys -- one 9 years old, the other 8 -- were arrested Friday on suspicion 
of starting a big fire at their Boyle Heights school. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the boys, who neighbors describe as "troublemakers," had 
confessed to setting an arson fire early Thursday morning that gutted three 
classrooms at Malabar Street School and, to the great dismay of their 
schoolmates, destroyed a set of sparkling, new Cinco de Mayo costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at $275,000, and the fire forced school officials to cram 
six classes into the auditorium and other temporary quarters on campus, and to 
lay plans to transfer students temporarily to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe that 40 pounds of muchacho could cause $275,000 of 
damage, but there it is," said Police Detective Ben Lovato. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects' names were not released because of their age. The pair, arrested 
on suspicion of arson, were taken late Friday to the Eastlake Juvenile Center. 
Decisions on how to proceed legally against the youngsters were pending. 
</P>
<P>
Lovato said the boys showed little emotion when questioned Friday by 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me put it this way," Lovato said, "they weren't crying about it." 
</P>
<P>
As they were led away by detectives Friday afternoon from the Hollenbeck Police 
Station, the boys, dressed in T-shirts, jeans and sneakers, looked straight 
ahead and said nothing when asked by a reporter about the fire. Looking more 
than a little perplexed, detectives kept a guiding hand on the boys' shoulders 
as they steered their four-foot-tall captives to a waiting patrol car. The boys 
were not handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
Attention focused early on the two youngsters. After the predawn fire was 
extinguished Thursday morning, the parents of the 9-year-old came to the 
Hollenbeck station and filed a missing persons report on their son. Lovato, on 
his way to the arson site, remembered this and returned to the station house to 
retrieve the report. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-year-old and his companion, it developed, had run away from home 
Wednesday afternoon and were not in school on Thursday. Malabar administrators 
told investigators that the parents of one of the boys had been scheduled to 
come to school the morning of the fire to discuss the youngster's behavioral 
problems, Lovato said. 
</P>
<P>
"On Thursday (morning)," a neighbor recalled, "the mother was out front 
watering her lawn and crying that her son had not come home." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, the boys were spotted by police a short distance from 
the school, playing video games in a neighborhood supermarket. The youngsters 
scrambled out of the store and were pursued through the neighborhood by at 
least four patrol cars, assisted by a helicopter. They escaped. 
</P>
<P>
The two returned home Thursday night and the parents called officers, police 
said. The 9-year-old, a fourth-grader at Malabar, was taken into custody at his 
home Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
His alleged accomplice, a third-grader at Malabar, returned to class Friday and 
was promptly summoned to the principal's office and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys had attracted police attention before, Lovato said. Two months 
ago, they ran away from home and were reported to police after spending the 
night on the roof of a Malabar School building, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've also been into other trouble -- playing with matches, other acts of 
vandalism," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood youngsters described the boys as "troublemakers" who often would 
make obscene finger gestures "to the teacher and say bad words." 
</P>
<P>
"They're always in trouble with the teachers," said 12-year-old Alicia 
Talamontes. Other youngsters said they had seen the boys playing with matches 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother says I shouldn't play with them," one fourth-grader said. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-like graffiti was found in the blackened ruins of the school building 
Thursday morning, but Lovato said that the duo were not believed to belong to a 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
"They're 'wannabes,' or whatever, but there's no gang involvement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of neither boy could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
While fire officials said it is not unusual for children the boys' age to cause 
fire damage, they could not recall arsonists so young setting such a 
devastating fire. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief G.R. Bowie, head of the city Fire Department's arson section, 
said some children play with fire as early as 3 years old, and 4-, 5- and 
6-year-olds often are fascinated with it. 
</P>
<P>
"But they're just experimenting," Bowie said. "If you can intervene early on, 
you can stop the pattern, unless there is an underlying emotional problem." 
</P>
<P>
Bowie said 8- and 9-year-olds are on the "upper edge" of youngsters who can be 
weaned off tendencies to play with fire. But in the subteen years, he said, 
"they know what they are doing. It's, 'Let's go light a fire.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the Malabar School on Friday, administrators and pupils tried to carry on 
despite the extraordinary distractions. Practices for the Cinco de Mayo 
celebration continued in a playground to the bounce of blaring musica Mexicana. 
It was the loss of the new costumes for the festival that most students had 
lamented after the fire, and children gasped when told about the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators were troubled by the development. "Sometimes, parents 
need to take more time with their kids," one administrator said. "Mischief 
could be a child's way to seeking help, of wanting attention."

COURT'S DECISION, INYO COUNTY OBJECTIONS PUT L.A. WATER IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
Two events this week, at the California Supreme Court in San Francisco and in a 
small meeting room in Bishop, portend changes in the arrangement that lets Los 
Angeles take about 90% of its water supply from Mono Lake and eastern Sierra 
streams. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the Supreme Court in effect said Los Angeles has been lucky 
to get away with diverting Sierra snowmelt before it reaches Mono Lake, the 
landmark salt lake that is slowly drying up east of Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to Mono Lake itself was not the issue. The ruling Wednesday came on an 
appeal that involved the city taking water that trout need in order to thrive 
in streams above the lake. But the decision could force Los Angeles to leave 
much more Sierra water to flow unmolested down the streams and into Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Groups that have fought to save the lake and the trout by challenging Los 
Angeles' long-held water rights savored the ruling, saying that it turns a new 
page in the history of water allocation in California. 
</P>
<P>
"This helps correct a half-century of injustice in the eastern Sierra," said 
Martha Davis, executive of the Lee Vining-based Mono Lake Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court order makes it clear that Los Angeles must obey state laws 
that say water cannot be taken from rivers and streams if fisheries will be 
destroyed. Los Angeles had argued that it is exempt, but a state appeals court 
ruled last year -- in overturning a Sacramento Superior Court judge -- that Los 
Angeles' diversions from the Mono Lake area must comply with the law. Los 
Angeles then appealed to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Los Angeles is concerned, this week's Supreme Court ruling requires 
state officials to rewrite the license that allows the city Department of Water 
and Power to divert flows from Rush, Lee Vining, Walker and Parker creeks, 
upstream from Mono Lake. The new license would explicitly ban water diversions 
that hurt the trout fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles takes, on the average, about 100,000 acre-feet a year in Mono Basin 
water into the Los Angeles Aqueduct. (An acre-foot is an acre of water a foot 
deep, roughly enough to meet the needs of a family of four for a year.) There 
was disagreement Friday about just how much DWP water practices would change in 
the aftermath of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the ruling could lead to Los Angeles leaving behind as much as half 
of the water it has taken historically from Mono Lake streams. The increased 
flow would be most of what scientists say is needed to keep the lake surface 
above the elevation of 6,377 feet, the level needed to prevent further damage 
to several species of lake wildlife and prevent dust storms, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is water the city of Los Angeles never had the right to divert in the 
first place," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett McInerney, Los Angeles attorney for California Trout, a sportfishing 
group, said the decision is even more sweeping in its impact on the California 
water scene and could lead to wholesale changes in water delivery contracts in 
the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
However, Patrick Flinn, a Palo Alto attorney who represented the National 
Audubon Society in the case, said the decision applies only to Los Angeles' 
operations in the Mono Lake basin. Even there, he said, the short-term effect 
on streams may be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Releasing Water 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is already releasing about 17,000 acre-feet down trout streams 
under two unrelated court injunctions involving Mono Lake and its feeder 
creeks. If Los Angeles can prove to the state Water Resources Control Board 
that the export of water south does not hurt the fish, some diversions may 
continue, Flinn said. 
</P>
<P>
"So there is a good chance it won't change the day-to-day operations of the DWP 
at all," Flinn said. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials had argued to the Supreme Court that the ruling could have 
sweeping impacts, and were not pleased that, after nearly 50 years of using 
Mono Basin water, their supply is threatened with a severe cutback. 
</P>
<P>
"Presumably we will lose some significant quantity of water, but I'm not sure 
we know how much," said Duane Georgeson, DWP assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could also have a domino effect on other water supplies in the 
state, because Los Angeles could make up the lost water from the Mono Lake area 
by taking more of its share from the State Water Project, which brings snowmelt 
from the western slope of the Sierra south by way of aqueducts that start at 
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles also got bad news from Inyo County, just south of the Mono Lake 
area, where most of the city's water supply is collected from the Owens River 
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Inyo Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings in the last week have found strong Inyo County opposition to a 
proposed agreement between county officials and Los Angeles to allow more 
ground water pumping in Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement, heaped with praise by Los Angeles and Inyo officials 
when it was unveiled last month, would have set up a scientific effort to 
measure any environmental damage from the pumping and would shut down wells 
causing harm. But the plan has been harshly attacked at well-attended meetings, 
the largest and most vocal occurring this week in Bishop.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOUNDED MAN RUNS INTO POLICE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young man with a bullet in his head ran into the lobby of the Pomona Police 
Department Thursday night, telling officers he had been wounded in a drive-by 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Jose Marcos Vargas, was taken by officers to Pomona 
Valley Community Hospital. Officers said late Friday that he was expected to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas came running into the station's lobby about 9:30 p.m., announcing to 
officers at the main desk that he had been shot in the head while he was in a 
car traveling on Park Avenue near Grand Street, Lt. Ernie Allsup said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a bullet in the back of his head and it looked like it followed the 
curve of his scalp," Allsup said. "There's a lump on the top of his head which 
I think is the bullet."

3 FATAL SHOOTINGS IN SINGLE NIGHT SHATTER RARE COMPTON CALM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than three weeks, the streets of Compton were unusually quiet, 
inexplicably so. Everyone knew that the relative peace would end; the only 
question was when. And early Friday, it did -- with a vengeance -- as gunfire 
left three men dead within a three-hour span. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Compton homicide investigator Jack McConnell sat slumped at his 
desk, a phone on his ear and a pen in his hand. On the line was an informant. 
On the floor were three half-empty bottles of soda, which the bleary-eyed cop 
was logging into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
For McConnell, who had been summoned to work before dawn, the morning marked a 
hideous return to normal after a most unusual period for the community: 25 days 
without a murder. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no rhyme or reason to it," said McConnell's boss, Police Lt. Percy 
Perrodin, as he perused the department's homicide log. "There has been a lull 
-- but for not that long a period. . . . It comes and it goes. You never know." 
</P>
<P>
In many communities with fewer than 100,000 residents, it may be no big deal to 
go nearly a month without a murder. But most cities are not as violent as 
Compton, where homicides occur far more frequently than in either Los Angeles 
or Washington, D.C., which is commonly referred to by the media as the murder 
capital of America. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington last year, authorities reported 58 homicides per 100,000 
residents. In Compton, which has slightly fewer than 100,000 residents, 82 were 
killed in 1988 and another 84 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
To put it another way -- about one of every 1,100 Compton residents has fallen 
victim to homicide in each of the last two years. And this year, the murder 
rate is even more appalling: 32 homicides already. 
</P>
<P>
During the nearly four-week murder respite, Perrodin's five-man homicide squad 
had no problem remaining busy. 
</P>
<P>
"Cases are open until they're solved. . . . If you don't solve it today, maybe 
then next week," McConnell said. The squad also investigated one shooting, 
which was ruled a justifiable homicide, and logged the death in the hospital of 
a 14-year-old victim of a March shooting. 
</P>
<P>
With the usual flurry of cases, files are temporarily set aside when detectives 
run out of fresh leads. But during the recent lull, McConnell said, "we (could) 
go back into cases that haven't been solved and reopen those cases." 
</P>
<P>
The respite came to an end at two minutes past midnight, when Johnny Michael 
Lee, 40, was shot in the neck after an argument during a party in his apartment 
in the 1300 block of East Glencoe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assailant Flees 
</P>
<P>
By the time patrol officers arrived, Lee's assailant, as well as other 
party-goers, "had run out of the location and into the night," Perrodin said. 
</P>
<P>
And by the time homicide investigators Johnny Swanson and Bryant Gilbraith had 
been called to the scene, a second, unrelated murder had occured only blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:15 a.m., authorities said, pedestrian Jimmy Michael Mapp, 32, was shot in 
the face after a yelling match with a motorist, who alighted from his vehicle, 
shotgun in hand. The incident in the 1300 block of South Long Beach Boulevard 
may have been narcotics-related, police said. 
</P>
<P>
McConnell, along with Marvin Branscomb and Gilbert Cross, were summoned as a 
result of a third slaying at 2:45 a.m. in a dingy apartment building in the 
1500 block of South Long Beach Boulevard. Authorities said Compton resident 
Donny Stalworth, whose age was not immediately known, was shot dead with a 
handgun during a drinking party in the apartment of Ray Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Host Also Shot 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was himself shot in the chest after demanding that the suspect remove 
Stalworth's body from his apartment, Perrodin said. He was hospitalized in 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Goshen, 24, of Compton, was arrested outside the building moments later 
and booked on suspicion of murder, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, city fathers have blamed the high crime rate on poverty, the 
proliferation of drugs and the prevalence of street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that more than 25% of Compton households receive welfare 
payments and that the estimated average household income in the city in 1988 
was $23,196 -- far less than the $39,600 average countywide. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have also blamed the skyrocketing murder rate on the easy 
availability of lethal weapons. In January, the City Council voted to ban 
AK-47s and other semiautomatic rifles.

DRUG USERS OVERRUN MACARTHUR PARK; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS SEEK TO WIN BACK AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a scene repeated daily at MacArthur Park, dozens of men and women boldly 
swap wads of cash for rocks of cocaine at the corner of 7th and Alvarado 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, they huddled together in tight knots near the park's General 
Douglas MacArthur Memorial, openly smoking crack in three-inch lengths of glass 
tubing loaded with pellets of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my family," said one wild-eyed woman, referring to the shabbily 
dressed people milling about. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a hit every 30 minutes and every hit is $5," said a man standing 
nearby. "I smoke about $200 a day." 
</P>
<P>
This is MacArthur Park, two years after the once-elegant 32 acres underwent a 
$400,000 face-lift that was to give it a new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
Revitalized by new lighting systems, playground equipment and public artworks, 
the 100-year-old park even experienced a dramatic drop in crime, according to 
police statistics. For a time, community leaders used those statistics to 
convince residents that MacArthur Park was a safe place to visit. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed about a year ago, however, when crack dealers and transients 
began filtering back to congregate in the park's restrooms and other aging 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
Now, residents and community leaders are once again struggling to reclaim the 
park, where police say there has been a significant increase in reported crimes 
and arrests over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent statistics from the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Rampart Division, 322 crimes were reported in and around the park 
in the first quarter of 1989, compared to 218 in the same quarter last year. 
Similarly, there were 859 arrests in the first quarter of 1989, compared to 419 
in the first quarter of 1988, on charges ranging from narcotics violations to 
burglary and assaults, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, the MacArthur Park Community Council, a coalition of local 
residents, merchants and city officials, planned a candlelight march around the 
perimeter of the park to protest the new surge in crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to take the park back for children and families," said Peter 
Daniels, who owns an art supply business bordering the park and who helped 
organize the march. "We did it once before and we can do it again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signal of Change 
</P>
<P>
Carmelo Alvarez, a spokesman for Los Angeles Beautiful, a private, nonprofit 
group devoted to downtown improvement, agreed and pointed to recent actions 
that could signal a change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for instance, the Los Angeles Police Department doubled its foot 
patrol to four officers and began assigning as many as eight mounted police a 
day to the park. Sgt. Robert Freet, who is in charge of patrols at the park, 
said the beefed-up units have averaged 15 arrests a day since last Thursday, 
"mostly for possession of rock cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see many families out here anymore and that is really sad," Freet 
said. "This park has really slid downhill." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the growing chorus of complaints last February, the Los Angeles 
Department of Recreation and Parks demolished an old concession stand and 
shuffle-board gaming area. The structures, which were originally built for 
senior citizens, had become a magnet for drug dealers and vagrants needing a 
place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things mean we are reclaiming the park for the good people," Alvarez 
said. "We will continue to fight against those negative elements that have 
caused so much despair in recent months." 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the park has all but been abandoned in the last six months by the 
families, children and seniors who once came to enjoy its tree-shaded glens, 
playgrounds and lake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Getting Out of Here' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disaster here," said Cesar Flores, shortly after evading a drug peddler 
as he walked with his wife, Rosio, and 2-year-old daughter along the edge of 
the trash-filled lake. "We're getting out of here. We can't even walk in 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
But Al Nodal, former director of exhibitions at the nearby Otis Art Institute 
of the Parsons School of Design, believes that the bad times can't last. 
</P>
<P>
"The park is a living organism that goes through ebbs and flows," said Nodal, 
who was hired by the school in 1983 to install public art in the park as a 
catalyst for positive change. "Nobody has given up on MacArthur Park, it's just 
that the drug dealers have taken over. 
</P>
<P>
"That drug scene will be cut out," Nodal predicted, "and the park will flourish 
again."

MAN GETS PROBATION FOR KILLING HIS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young Glendale man found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the killing his 
father was sentenced Friday to three years on probation by a Pasadena Superior 
Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the probation, Arnel Salvatierra, 20, promised to undergo 
regular psychiatric counseling. Salvatierra was 17 when he shot his father, 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatierra's sentencing had been delayed for almost three months after his 
attorneys requested time for three psychologists to examine him. Under 
California law, a minor convicted in Superior Court must be examined by a 
court-approved diagnostic expert before he can be sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatierra has been free on his own recognizance since Dec. 30, when a jury 
found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the lesser of two charges in the 
shooting. He was acquitted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing hearing before Judge Gilbert C. Alston, Salvatierra's 
attorney, Marcia Morrissey, called the sentence "appropriate." She said the 2 
1/2 years her client spent in custody in Juvenile Hall in Eastlake had 
rehabilitated him. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Wondries, who prosecuted the case, called 
Salvatierra "a very dangerous kid." She said Salvatierra only began receiving 
counseling four months ago, when he was released from custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Arnel has made a great deal of progress, but Arnel is a long way from being 
rehabilitated," Wondries said. "All the experts agree that Arnel needs 
intensive psychological counseling." 
</P>
<P>
The January, 1986, slaying of Oscar Salvatierra attracted international 
attention when it was disclosed that, on the day before his death, he had 
received a written death threat. Police at first suggested that the threat 
might be related to the Filipino newspaper he worked for being critical of 
then-President Ferdinand Marcos. But authorities later disclosed that his son 
had made the threat. 
</P>
<P>
During his three-week trial, Arnel Salvatierra testified that his father had 
abused him. He admitted that he had planned the slaying for weeks before 
shooting his father in the head while he was sleeping in the family's north 
Glendale home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living With Mother 
</P>
<P>
Arnel Salvatierra has been living with his mother, two sisters and a brother 
since January and is a student at a Los Angeles-area college, Morrissey said. 
She would not disclose the name of the college. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7, Theresa K. DeBurger of Glendale -- Arnel Salvatierra's 
then-girlfriend, who was accused of hiding the clothing he wore when he killed 
his father -- was sentenced to two years' probation and fined $715. Last year, 
DeBurger pleaded no contest to being an accessory after the fact in the 
slaying.

PRINCIPAL GETS A LIFT (UP TO ROOFTOP) AS STUDENTS TOP HER READING GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind the backstop and the kickball game, within earshot of the reading class 
and slightly to the left of the third-graders dancing the samba, the principal 
of Cerritos Elementary School was sitting. 
</P>
<P>
On the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Jeannie K. Flint was in the odd position because of a bet. She told 
the 400 students at the Glendale school that if they read for 500,000 minutes 
at home, she'd sit on the roof for a whole day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Average of 1,250 Minutes 
</P>
<P>
They did, averaging 1,250 minutes of reading each. That's a bit over 20 hours! 
</P>
<P>
So on Friday morning, serenaded by two columns of students singing "Up on the 
Roof" and equipped with a parasol, a desk and -- of course -- books, the 
no-nonsense 43-year-old educator climbed a rickety ladder and then another one 
and calmly held forth from on high. 
</P>
<P>
Flint is not the first educator to give a literal reading of the notion of 
higher education. A South Pasadena principal has been up on the roof twice 
after her elementary school students met reading quotas. The head of a San 
Gabriel school did her one better by spending a day atop the cafeteria -- in a 
monkey costume. But students had to read 1 million minutes for that one. 
</P>
<P>
Novel or not, the stunt was popular with the kids at Cerritos Elementary. They 
passed messages of encouragement to Flint in a basket, decked her chair and 
ladder with balloons and waved to her in between innings of their games at 
recess. And, fear not Mrs. Flint, they also said they'd continue to read. 
</P>
<P>
That was the point. In the tradition of her fellow high-minded principals, 
Flint made the proposition in January as a way to encourage students to read on 
their own. She asked parents to tally the minutes their children read or were 
read to each day, using calendars the students brought home. The minutes 
totaled on a large chart on the wall of the school eventually went over the top 
at 581,346 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
For added encouragement, a local Kiwanis Club promised a $50 U.S. Savings Bond 
to the student from each grade level who read the most minutes. The last of the 
five savings bonds was handed out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time Flint has done something unconventional to encourage 
children to learn. A few years ago she instituted a daily "sustained silent 
reading period" -- 10 minutes -- when everyone in the school dropped whatever 
they were doing to read. And Flint is notorious for giving out gold slips, "If 
I catch them being good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enjoying Ordeal 
</P>
<P>
Flint said she was tempted to give gold slips to the whole school on Friday. 
Wearing a black-and-gold school sweat shirt, with an "I Cerritos School" button 
and hooked up to the world below her by cordless telephone, she said she was 
enjoying every minute of her self-enforced ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to encourage them to read and make reading a lifelong habit," Flint 
said as a lunch prepared by a group of students was hoisted up to her on the 
flat-topped roof. "I knew they could do it. I just didn't think they could do 
it so soon."

CHURCH, SYNAGOGUE MEMBERSHIP REACHES NEW LOWS, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE GALLUP JR. and JIM CASTELLI, Los Angeles Times Syndicate 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The percentage of Americans who identified themselves as members of a church or 
synagogue in 1988 -- 65% -- was the lowest since the Gallup Poll began tracking 
such figures in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Church membership and attendance figures for 1988 were also unprecedented for 
American Catholics: 
</P>
<P>
* For the first time, Catholics were no more likely than Protestants to be 
church members. 
</P>
<P>
* Church attendance among Catholics reached an all-time low, with 48% saying 
they had attended church in the past seven days. 
</P>
<P>
* The historic gap between Catholics and Protestants on church attendance all 
but disappeared. Catholics were only three percentage points more likely than 
Protestants to attend church weekly; the gap had never fallen below double 
figures before. 
</P>
<P>
The previous low for overall church attendance was 67% in 1982. As recently as 
1985, 71% of Americans claimed membership in a church or synagogue. In 1987, 
69% of Americans were church members. 
</P>
<P>
Decreases were largest among college graduates, those with less than a high 
school education, adults under 30 and Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Church membership declined sharply among Catholics and remained fairly stable 
among Protestants, so that 72% of each group claimed church membership. 
Catholics have historically been more likely than Protestants to claim church 
membership. In 1987, for example, 79% of Catholics and 73% of Protestants were 
church members. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, church attendance actually increased by two percentage points in 
1988, when 42% of Americans said they had attended church or synagogue in the 
past seven days. While attendance declined among Catholics (from 52% to 48%), 
it increased significantly among Protestants (from 38% to 45%). 
</P>
<P>
The largest single decrease in church membership was among college graduates. 
While 74% were church members in 1987, membership fell by 10 percentage points 
to 64% in 1988. There was a similar nine-point decline at the other end of the 
educational scale. Among those with less than a high school degree, membership 
fell from 69% to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
The membership decline was consistent by region. Membership in the East fell by 
five points, to 64%; by three points in the Midwest, to 68%; by five points in 
the South, to 71% and by five points in the West, to 53%. 
</P>
<P>
Among evangelicals, those who describe themselves as "born-again Christians," 
membership fell by only one point, to 87%. Among non-evangelicals, membership 
fell by three points, to 59%.

NEWBURY PARK'S 8-3 VICTORY DROPS SIMI VALLEY FROM 1ST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody does anything in Marmonte League baseball without first checking with 
Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Think you're good? Think you have a shot? Not until the Pioneers say you do. 
Not until you have taken the title away from them. 
</P>
<P>
Consider it all but taken. 
</P>
<P>
The brash boys from Newbury Park, the guys with all the gall to do it, beat 
Simi Valley, 8-3, Friday at Newbury Park to move into first place, a half-game 
ahead of the Pioneers, whose run of three consecutive league championships is 
in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park (17-2-3, 8-1 in league play), which defeated Simi Valley, 6-4, the 
first time the teams met, is the first league team to sweep a season series 
from the Pioneers since Camarillo in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we doubted it for a second," Newbury Park pitcher Jeremy Dewey 
said. "I have confidence in our team that we can beat them with whoever's on 
the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Dewey was thrust into the team's No. 1 role when Tim Beal was banished from the 
team a week ago for violating school rules. Dewey, who improved to 6-1 with his 
complete-game victory, pitched in and out of trouble and kept throwing 
curveballs. By his own account, "well more than half" of Dewey's pitches were 
curves. 
</P>
<P>
That was by design. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to spot the ball, keep them off balance and make them think," he 
said. "Where I got in trouble is when I threw it down the middle and they just 
bombed it." 
</P>
<P>
Dewey gave up 11 hits, including at least one in each inning but the seventh. 
But Simi Valley (19-3, 8-2) stranded 11 runners -- 10 in the first five 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were waiting for the three-run dinger to happen for us," Simi 
Valley Coach Mike Scyphers said. "And it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
While the Pioneers craved the clutch hit, Newbury Park wracked Simi Valley 
starter Rich Langford for five hits and six runs in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Already leading, 3-1, the Panthers scored five runs in the fourth after 
Langford walked the bases loaded with none out. He was replaced by left-hander 
Kenny Hood, whose second pitch to left-hander Eric Greene was whacked into the 
gap in right-center field. All three runners scored on the triple. 
</P>
<P>
Greene came home on Geoff Black's single and Black scored on Brian Smith's 
grounder to give Newbury Park an 8-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park Coach Gary Fabricius said that his hitters wanted a look at 
Langford, who had an earned-run average of 0.50 entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They were looking forward to him, that's how confident they are," he said. 
"They wanted to see how good they are. 
</P>
<P>
"This group has been loose all year, and there was no reason to change now with 
the league championship on the line." 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park nicked Langford in the first inning when Danny Madsen, who singled 
in each of his first three at-bats, scored Greene from third. The Pioneers tied 
it in the third, 1-1, on Greg Santos' run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
Madsen and Wayne Cook singled home runs in the third to give the Panthers a 3-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jenkins' two-run single in the fifth was all Simi Valley could muster in 
the way of a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey pitched to only seven batters in the final two innings and struck out the 
last three he faced in the seventh -- all on curves in the dirt.

CHANNEL ISLANDS' BROWN DEFENDS HURDLES TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Brown of Channel Islands High was remarkably subdued for someone who 
had just successfully defended two titles at the Ventura County track and field 
championships at Camarillo High on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had run his best times of the season in winning the 110-meter high 
hurdles and the 300-meter intermediate hurdles, Brown was not terribly excited 
because, he said, the really important meets lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the guys really get pumped up for this meet," the Raider senior said. 
"But it really doesn't mean that much to me. The dual meets and invitationals 
during the regular season really don't matter. It's how you run at the end of 
the season that counts." 
</P>
<P>
The meets to which the Brown referred are the Marmonte League finals at 
Camarillo next Saturday and the Southern Section prelims, finals and Masters 
meet the following three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Then, hopefully, the state championships at Cerritos College in June. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I want to end up," said Brown, who has made a oral commitment to 
attend Cal State Northridge in the fall. "I didn't get there last year, so I 
want to make it this year." 
</P>
<P>
After finishing fifth in the high hurdles and fourth in the intermediates at 
last year's Southern Section 4-A Division championships, Brown was eliminated 
at the Masters meet, the section's qualifying meet for the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown wasn't about to be beat Friday, coming from behind to win both races. 
</P>
<P>
In the high hurdles, he trailed Emory Nelson of Simi Valley for the first four 
flights of barriers before taking charge midway through the race to win in a 
wind-aided 14.31 seconds. Nelson was second in 14.39. 
</P>
<P>
In the intermediates, he surged from fourth to first in the last 100 meters to 
defeat Jason Stein of Oak Park, 38.71 to 38.89. 
</P>
<P>
"I just concentrated on getting over the hurdles as fast as possible," Brown 
said of his homestretch drive. "I didn't get off to a good start so that's why 
they were with me." 
</P>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa was also busy defending some titles on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The reigning state champion in the 100 and 200 meters, Burnham won the 100 in a 
wind-aided 11.3 and the 200 in 24.46. She also anchored the Spartans' 400- and 
1,600-meter relay teams to victories in times of 48.86 and 3 minutes, 55.34 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham has won three county titles in the 100 and four in the 200 during her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Dameworth and Deena Drossin of Agoura, both two-time defending county 
champions in cross-country, were double winners in the 1,600 and 3,200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth won the 1,600 in 4:20.5 and the 3,200 in 9:06.8; Drossin won the 
girls' 1,600 in 5:03.53 and the 3,200 in 10:54.2. 
</P>
<P>
After holding off Chad Malesich of Camarillo in the homestretch of the 1,600, 
Dameworth had to come from behind to win 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks led Dameworth and Abe Valdez of Camarillo by 
50 meters at the 1,600-meter mark (4:24), but couldn't maintain his blistering 
pace and his rivals passed him with 250 meters left in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised he went out as fast as he did," Dameworth said. "I kept 
waiting for him to come back to us, but when he went through the 1,600 in 4:24, 
I wasn't sure if we were going to catch him." 
</P>
<P>
After passing Williamson, Dameworth had to withstand Valdez's final sprint. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez finished second in a personal best of 9:07.0 and Williamson was third in 
9:10.7. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included Shannon Wiebelhaus of Rio Mesa in the girls' 300-meter 
low hurdles (45.50) and Anette Noel of Agoura in the girls' shotput with a 
personal-best effort of 40 feet.

MOORPARK'S DOW SETTLES FOR 1-HITTER IN 7-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
De Dow couldn't have gotten much closer to perfection Friday. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the seventh inning, Valley College's Julie Knoop beat out an 
infield single, spoiling Dow's bid for her first perfect game of the season. 
Dow (23-7), who has pitched two no-hitters this year, pitched two perfect games 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hit, there was no further damage, however, and Moorpark cruised to 
an easy 7-0 Western State Conference softball win in its last home game of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The victory boosted the Lady Raiders' home win streak against conference 
opponents to 41 games and ensured them of at least a share of the conference 
title. In addition, Moorpark (31-10, 12-1) broke the previous school record for 
wins in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Stevens hit a two-run home run, walked twice, was hit by a pitch and 
scored three times. Mary Cress had three hits, drove in a run and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Kauffman and Rosa Jimenez each added a run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
In another WSC softball game: 
</P>
<P>
College of the Canyons 10, Cuesta 1 -- Freshman right-hander Michelle Ruffner 
pitched a two-hitter, and Jill Greenwood and Michele Wood each hit two-run 
triples for the Lady Cougars at Canyons. Debbie Rendall had three hits and one 
RBI for Canyons, which has won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffner walked one and improved to 25-13. With one game remaining, second-place 
Canyons (25-14, 11-2) trails Moorpark by a game. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 1-1, Canyons scored eight times in the fourth on triples 
by Greenwood and Wood.

Cal Baptist 9, The Master's 2 -- Mustang starter John March allowed six runs in

fifth. Darren Beck tripled and doubled for Master's.

<P>
VALLEY TEAMS ACED OUT OF TENNIS PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a 67% chance that the Valley area would be represented in the 
Southern California junior college team tennis regionals when coaches from the 
region convened to select the tournament's final entries Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Three schools -- Pierce, Moorpark and Orange Coast -- were left to vie for one 
at-large berth in the tournament, which begins next week. 
</P>
<P>
The winner: Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark finished third in the Western State Conference, so even though the 
Raiders split their season series with second-place Pierce, they were quickly 
dropped from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce has a 6-3 victory over OCC, but only after the Pirates, who finished 
second in the South Coast Conference, were forced to forfeit two singles and 
all three doubles matches because they used an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Xanthos, Pierce's coach, said that Orange Coast prevailed in a vote 
because his peers felt the Pirates were playing better tennis than Pierce in 
the past month. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my argument on the basis of record, but, apparently, the coaches didn't 
accept that," Xanthos said. 
</P>
<P>
All three teams probably would have made the field had there not been a 
three-way tie for the Pacific Coast Conference championship. Mira Costa, 
Grossmont and San Diego Mesa all tied for first and advanced to the regionals. 
Pierce defeated Mira Costa, 7-2, in a nonconference match this season. 
</P>
<P>
The regional field consists of Santa Barbara of the WSC, Saddleback and Orange 
Coast of the Orange Empire Conference, Long Beach City College of the South 
Coast Conference, College of the Desert of the Foothill Conference, and Mira 
Costa, Grossmont and San Diego Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking even: Aaron Rudelson is 1-1 for the Hampshire College (Amherst, Mass.) 
baseball team that the freshman right-hander helped found during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Rudelson, a drama student and former All-Southern Section pitcher at Highland 
Hall, pitched a two-hitter and struck out 15 to earn his win last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature was 50 degrees when the game began and it got progressively 
colder as the clouds rolled in," Rudelson said. 
</P>
<P>
During the fall, Rudelson and two other teammates persuaded the school's 
administration to fund the program, which has two games remaining on its 
inaugural four-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Rudelson, who was 13-1 with a 1.40 earned-run average and also batted .539 last 
season at Highland Hall, hopes to have a longer schedule next season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's pretty committed and puts out 100%," Rudelson said. "The thing 
about our team is we have a lot of spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Calling all coaches: Paul Dunham, athletic director at Moorpark College, said 
that the school is conducting a monthlong search for candidates to replace 
baseball Coach Ron Stillwell, who will resign at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll advertise the job," Dunham said. "I've already received about four or 
five calls of recommendation for different people." 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the part-time position, which is listed as a 10-hour-a-week 
assignment, need a bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
Football fever: It's only April, but the weekend is full of football for Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at 7 p.m., the Matadors will conclude spring practice with a 
intrasquad scrimmage at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Northridge will host a reunion for former players and 
coaches at the AirTel Hotel in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Among the former Matador coaches expected in be in attendance are Tom Keele, 
now an assistant at Cal; Sam Winningham, the chairman of CSUN's physical 
education department; and Gary Torgeson, coach of Northridge's top- ranked 
softball team. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which begins with no-host cocktails at 5 p.m., is a $100-per person 
fund-raiser for the Northridge football program.

ROSE REPORTEDLY WILL CONTEND BLACKMAIL THREAT SPURRED PROBE

Pete Rose will contend that a former friend, angered when the Cincinnati Reds 
manager refused to lend him $40,000, falsely accused Rose of betting on Red 
games and triggered baseball's investigation, according to a newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Post quoted unnamed sources Friday as saying that Rose will tell 
the investigators the accusations were made up after a blackmail attempt by 
Paul Janszen. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen is serving time in a Cincinnati halfway house on federal charges of 
evading taxes derived from the sale of steroids. Federal court documents 
indicate that Janszen has alleged he placed bets with a bookmaker on baseball 
games, including Reds' games, on behalf of an unidentified Cincinnati resident. 
Published reports have identified the resident as Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Rose could be suspended for life if he has bet on Red games and for a year if 
he has bet on other baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has tried to disassociate himself from Janszen and several other 
acquaintances from a gym in suburban Cincinnati, where Rose worked out. Several 
of the gym operators have been charged or sentenced as being part of a 
cocaine-smuggling operation. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, in Philadelphia for a game against the Phillies, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's an anonymous source, I don't want to see it," Rose said. "If no one 
signs their name to it, I don't want to read it." 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter attempted to read the story to Rose, he said: "I don't want to 
hear about it, either." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Rose has not yet been asked to give his version of the 
allegations to Commissioner Bart Giamatti and John Dowd, baseball's special 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Levin, a spokesman in Giamatti's office, declined to comment on the 
matter. Rose's attorney, Reuven Katz, did not return a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's office has confirmed that it is investigating "serious 
allegations" about Rose, concerning his gambling. A federal grand jury in 
Cincinnati also is investigating Rose, reportedly for possible tax evasion 
regarding gambling earnings. 
</P>
<P>
One of Rose's business partners, Mike Bertolini, has confirmed that he received 
a subpoena to appear next week before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bookmakers Janszen allegedly dealt with was Ronald Peters of 
Franklin, Ohio, who has pleaded guilty to cocaine distribution and tax evasion 
related to bookmaking. He awaits sentencing in U.S. District Court in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
A federal prosecutor has confirmed publicly that Peters claims he took as much 
as $1 million in bets from Rose over a two-year period. Peters has been 
described as Rose's principal bookmaker, a charge Rose has denied. 
</P>
<P>
The Post said Friday that Rose will contend that he lent Janszen $10,000 late 
last summer, but turned him down when Janszen came back in late September or 
early October asking to borrow another $40,000. At that time, according to the 
newspaper, Janszen claimed to Katz that Rose owed him the $40,000, but wouldn't 
say for what. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen told Katz late last year that unless he got more money from Rose, he 
would tell baseball officials that Rose had bet on games, the newspaper said. 
Katz reportedly turned Janszen away.

For the 90th year here in the Ojai Valley, once the home of the Chumash Indians 
who lived beneath the 7,000-foot peak Topa Topa, not far from what is now the 
Los Padres National Forest, a tennis tournament is being played. 
</P>
<P>
As usual in tennis, a good serve is important. Here, in the morning, they serve 
orange juice and in the afternoon, they serve tea, all for no charge. Not even 
for being genteel. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, the Ojai Valley college tournament is a kinder, gentler kind of tennis 
tournament, with the possible exception of the play itself, in which, perhaps 
not so surprisingly, players want to clobber one another. 
</P>
<P>
Take Pat Crow of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Crow defeated Roberto Di Givlio of San Jose State Friday, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, to 
stay on course for a possible Big West showdown with Mark Kaplan of UC Irvine. 
But he was thinking instead about the people he beat from the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had any trouble with any of them I've played," he said. "Our Big 
West teams are just as strong as they are." 
</P>
<P>
That brought a rebuttal from Eric Amend of USC. Amend, who defeated top-seeded 
Stanford's Jeff Tarango in the tournament's biggest upset, reached the 
semifinals with a three-set victory Friday over Billy Barber of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got players in that conference, but only players, because the Pac-10 
has history and tradition," he said. "They are as representative in players, 
but not with teams. We are deeper. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Playing on the oak-shaded courts is something of a tradition for Amend, who has 
done it since he was 14. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could die and go to heaven, this is it," he said. "This is tennis 
heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Galbraith of UCLA defeated Byron Black of USC, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), and 
will play Amend in one of today's Pac-10 semifinal matches. Martin Blackman of 
Stanford, who defeated Jason Netter of UCLA, 7-5, 5-7, 6-3, will play Buff 
Farrow of UCLA in the other semifinal. Farrow defeated Jeff Cathrall of 
Stanford, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.

BOWIE'S ANKLE PROBLEMS CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jolts of electricity shot through Sam Bowie's chronically injured right ankle 
Friday morning at Loyola Marymount, a therapeutic form of torture to which the 
Portland Trail Blazer center regularly submits in order to play. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie's status for Game 2 of the National Basketball Assn. Western Conference 
quarterfinals between the Lakers and Trail Blazers on Sunday depends on how 
well he responds to his latest electronic stimulation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring 15 points and grabbing five rebounds in 21 minutes and being a 
positive in an otherwise forgetable 20-point loss in Game 1, Bowie awoke Friday 
with the ankle once again swollen and sore. Actually, Bowie said it hurt during 
Thursday night's game, but he said he has learned to play with it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real sore to the touch," Bowie said. "If you were to touch it now, I'd 
jump off this seat. But give me 48 hours, and maybe I'll be ready to play. I 
don't know. 
</P>
<P>
"I always expect it to get worse after I have any type of action on it. I don't 
limp, but it throbs whenever I come out of the game. . . . It's frustrating 
because I go into a game knowing I can only play about 20 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
In his 20 minutes in relief of power forward Caldwell Jones and center Kevin 
Duckworth, Bowie made six of seven shots and blocked two. But Bowie, who missed 
15 of the Trail Blazers' final 19 games of the regular season, said that his 
ankle soreness still limits his effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"I shot the ball well and played pretty good defense (Thursday night), but I 
somewhat paced myself. I had to." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Adelman, Portland's coach, liked what he saw from Bowie in Game 1. But, 
aware of Bowie's extensive medical history, Adelman said it is difficult to 
count on Bowie's presence. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman, however, did not rule out the possibility that the 7-footer might 
replace Jones at starting power forward. Jones did a good job holding the 
Lakers' A.C. Green to 11 points and three rebounds in Game 1, but he did almost 
nothing else. Jones did not attempt a shot, nor grab a rebound or have an 
assist. He did have one blocked shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," said Adelman, when asked if he might make the change. "That's 
something we'll have to evaluate. We really won't even know until Sunday 
whether Sam can even play. But, with the way he played (Thursday night), if 
he's capable, he'll be in there." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson (bruised right knee) and Byron Scott (sore right wrist) were held 
out of the Lakers' light workout Friday morning at the Forum. Both are expected 
to play in Game 2. After making 10 of 16 shots, including five of six 
three-point attempts, Scott said his chronically sore wrist felt better. "A lot 
of the pain is out of it now," Scott said. "I just got to keep getting therapy 
(ice treatments) until it's not there anymore. It's bothered me, off and on, 
for a month." . . . Scott's eight rebounds in Game 1 was a career high in the 
playoffs. . . . Johnson suffered his bruise when he banged knees with a Trail 
Blazer. He continued to play after the collision Thursday night. . . . Michael 
Cooper, who needed 21 stitches to close a cut on his forehead after running 
into a railing in the Forum, practiced Friday.

KENTUCKY DERBY TRIAL AT CHURCHILL DOWNS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSTON GETS CHANCE TODAY TO REDEEM HIMSELF FOR BIG FLOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOUISVILLE, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Houston doesn't redeem himself today, his name could be changed to 
Galveston. 
</P>
<P>
The flop of the Santa Anita Derby is favored in the Kentucky Derby Trial on 
opening day at Churchill Downs, and a win will carry him into the Derby itself 
next Saturday, when Awe Inspiring, Easy Goer's alter ego, is also expected to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Shug McGaughey, who has been reluctant to run Awe Inspiring as an entry 
with Easy Goer, the Wood Memorial winner and Derby favorite, indicated Friday 
that he would start both colts in the 115th running of the Triple Crown race. 
The horses race for the Phipps family, Ogden Phipps owning Easy Goer and his 
son, Dinny, owning Awe Inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey's change of plans makes sense, because Awe Inspiring, a late 
developer, won the Flamingo Stakes, a major Derby prep, at Hialeah in his last 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Under Kentucky rules, the Phipps horses must be coupled for betting purposes in 
the Derby, but if they ran separately, Awe Inspiring would probably be the 
third betting choice, behind Easy Goer and Sunday Silence, the Santa Anita 
Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
Flown here from New York Wednesday, Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring were among the 
first horses on the track Friday morning. They each galloped 1 1/2 miles -- a 
quarter of a mile farther than the Derby distance -- in the eerie predawn 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Van Berg, winner of the 1987 Derby with Alysheba and a trainer without a 
starter in this year's race, was on his stable pony as McGaughey and his wife, 
Mary Jane, who is eight months pregnant, watched from the outside rail on the 
backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"Run 'em both," Van Berg said to the trainer's wife. "You might never get 
another chance to run two colts this good in the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Another horseman on the track was trainer Wayne Lukas, despite a painful back 
injury that has prevented him from straightening up for five weeks. Lukas gets 
on his pony these days only when Houston trains, and the $2.9-million Seattle 
Slew yearling also galloped 1 1/2 miles in preparation for the one-mile, 
$75,000 Trial, which is the final Derby preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
Houston was undefeated in three starts until he ran fifth as the 4-5 favorite 
in the Santa Anita Derby. Sunday Silence beat him by 16 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas is attributing Houston's sorry performance to the 95-degree heat at Santa 
Anita, although other trainers in the race said their horses were not affected 
because the humidity was low. 
</P>
<P>
"The stalls as Santa Anita were about as ventilated as a coffin," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
"But one thing about that problem is that it's easily corrected. We had to get 
the horse's electrolytes balanced. We've been able to replace his fluids with a 
supplement that we've put in his water, fed him directly and even given him 
intravenously. We feel that we've got the problem under control." 
</P>
<P>
On a wet track listed as fast, Houston worked five furlongs last Monday in a 
rousing :58 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
The weather has been hot and humid here this week. On Thursday, the temperature 
was in the mid-80s, missing the record for the date by one degree. There was 
the chance of overnight rain Friday, and rain again early today, and the 
temperature at race time might be around 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Six horses are entered in the Trial, which in 62 runnings has produced only 
five Derby winners, the last being Tim Tam in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Today's lineup, in post-position order, consists of Affirmed's Image, Belek, In 
His Cups, Pulverizing, Houston and One That Got Away. Houston carries 122 
pounds, including Laffit Pincay, and spots the opposition three or five pounds 
per horse. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to make himself comfortable Friday in a director's chair outside a 
lavishly redecorated barn office that was only a cinder-block room a week ago, 
Lukas borrowed a copy of the Daily Racing Form and checked the records of the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Belek, undefeated in three starts, is owned and trained by Louie Roussel, who 
gave racing Risen Star, last year's Preakness and Belmont winner after running 
third in the Derby. Affirmed's Image has won his last three starts. In His Cups 
has won four of his last five races. Pulverizing is a stakes winner from 
Maryland and One That Got Away won on grass at Keeneland the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas is hoping for an easy win for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy race," the trainer said. "There are some horses in there that 
know how to win." 
</P>
<P>
Houston knew nothing else, until he ran up the track at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Half of the horses in the Derby Trial -- Affirmed's Image, In His Cups and One 
That Got Away -- are not eligible for the Triple Crown races and Louie Roussel 
says that Belek will not run in the Kentucky Derby because he figures to have 
limitations beyond a mile. . . . Notation, who was beaten by Belek at Keeneland 
before winning the Lexington Stakes there on Tuesday, will run in the Derby and 
Chris Antley is likely to be his jockey.

NEWSWIRE: FORGED PRESCRIPTIONS LINKED TO CARL MONROE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A doctor whose name was on four tranquilizer bottles found in the apartment of 
former San Francisco 49er Carl Monroe, who died earlier this week at 29, said 
three of the prescriptions were forged, according to Friday's San Francisco 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose police found two empty bottles of Valium and two empty bottles of 
diazepam, a generic form of Valium, inside Monroe's apartment on Wednesday, the 
day he died, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
A doctor, who asked not to be identified, had been treating Monroe for chronic 
bronchitis and said that he prescribed Valium once, on April 18, to help Monroe 
sleep. He denied writing the prescriptions for three other bottles found in the 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating the prescriptions amid speculation that Monroe might 
have died of a Valium overdose, but autopsy results won't be known for several 
weeks.

LIGHT WINDS ELIMINATE POSSIBILITY OF A RECORD IN RACE TO ENSENADA 
</P>

Forget about any records in the 42nd Newport-to-Ensenada yacht race. Mother 
Nature took care of that Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The race started in a light five-to-seven knot southerly breezes that dwindled 
to near zero off the Coronados Islands south of South Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Conner, in Stars &amp; Stripes, was spotted off Rosarito Beach, about 75 
miles from Ensenada, with no wind. He called the committee boat about 9 p.m. 
and said he was still sitting off Rosarito Beach with no wind. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Wall, Newport Ocean Sailing Assn. president, said no boats were expected 
to finish until early this morning and won't come close to the elapsed-time 
record of 10 hours 22 minutes, set by the catamaran Double Bullet in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, clear skies greeted the 520 boats. First off the dual lines, in an 
orderly start, were the Ocean Racing Catamarans on the inshore line and the 
Ultra-Light Displacement monohulls on the offshore line. Conner's Stars &amp; 
Stripes and Rudy Choy's Aikane X-5, the favored catamarans, were lost in a 
crowd of 28 multihulls. Blondie and Taxi Dancer led the 17 ultra-lights, known 
as downwind sleds, across the line in what was expected to be a close, 125-mile 
race.

JORDAN, PIPPEN HELP BULLS SURPRISE CAVALIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Jordan had 31 points and Scottie Pippen shook off shoulder problems to 
score 13 of his 22 points in the third quarter as the Chicago Bulls defeated 
the Cleveland Cavaliers, 95-88, Friday night in Game 1 of the Eastern 
Conference quarterfinals at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought they were going to sweep us. We proved them wrong," Pippen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland won all six of its regular-season meetings with the Bulls, including 
a 90-84 season-ending victory Sunday in which three Cavalier starters were 
rested because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no pressure on us, and all the pressure was on them," said Jordan, 
who also had 11 assists. "We just stayed inside with our defense, kept the 
pressure on down there and helped out as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Cavalier guard Mark Price was unable to play because of a pulled groin. The 
absence of his outside shooting proved to be Cleveland's undoing on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Ehlo led Cleveland with 19 points, and Larry Nance had 18. 
</P>
<P>
Pippen made three three-point shots and Craig Hodges added another during a 
30-11 Chicago run that increased the Bulls' lead to 77-53 late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 101, Boston 91 -- Joe Dumars scored 25 points and John Salley blocked 
five shots as the Pistons held the Celtics to a record-tying 10 points in the 
opening game of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series at Auburn Hills, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Salley said a meeting with Isiah Thomas helped to prepare him for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We had sort of a heart-to-heart talk last week," Salley said. "Isiah told me 
to grow up. He wanted to know if I had my head in my game. 
</P>
<P>
"Isiah is my mentor. He told me we could be a great team if I played up to my 
ability. That really meant a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, who won three of four games between these teams during the regular 
season, outscored Boston, 21-10, in the second quarter, tying a playoff record 
set April 25, 1982, at Seattle when the SuperSonics limited Houston to 10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Salley tied a club record with his five blocked shots during the quarter as the 
Pistons, who led 27-25 after one period, surged to a 15-point lead on a jumper 
by Dennis Rodman with 2:29 remaining in the half. It was 48-35 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics -- playing without Larry Bird, who missed the final 76 
regular-season games after surgery Nov. 19 for bone spurs -- got 27 points from 
Kevin McHale, 19 from Reggie Lewis and 18 from Robert Parish. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 111, Houston 107 -- Derrick McKey and Xavier McDaniel each made two 
free throws in the final 20 seconds as the SuperSonics defeated the Rockets in 
the opening game of their Western Conference quarterfinal playoff series at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets led, 105-104, with 1:20 left after a three-point play by Akeem 
Olajuwon and a pair of baskets by Buck Johnson brought Houston back from a 
104-98 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But Sedale Threatt, who came off the Seattle bench to score 22 points, made an 
18-foot fall-away jumper with 1:01 remaining to put Seattle in front to stay at 
106-105. 
</P>
<P>
With 44 seconds left, Olajuwon was called for traveling as he went to the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by McKey with 20 seconds to go put Seattle in front, 108-105. 
Eric (Sleepy) Floyd dunked for Houston with 16 seconds left and immediately 
fouled McDaniel, who made both free throws with 15 seconds to play for a 
110-107 Seattle lead. 
</P>
<P>
Purvis Short missed a three-point shot with 12 seconds to go and Derrick 
Chievous rebounded for the Rockets, but had his shot blocked by Alton Lister, 
his eighth of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Lister made a free throw with two seconds to go for the final point of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 104, Denver 103 -- Tom Chambers made two free throws with three seconds 
remaining and rookie Dan Majerle made a game-saving steal as the Suns beat the 
Nuggets in the opening game of their playoff series at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Denver, trailing 94-80 with 8:11 remaining, got eight points from Walter Davis 
in a 19-5 run that tied the score, 99-99, with 1:13 left. 
</P>

After Bill Hanzlik missed two free throws with 53 seconds to go, Kevin Johnson 
sank a foul shot for a 100-99 Sun lead with 37 seconds left.

Davis, who played 11 seasons with Phoenix before signing as an unrestricted

COACH CREDITS TRADITION, TOP ASSISTANTS FOR OCCIDENTAL'S TRACK SUCCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
Since becoming track and cross-country coach at Occidental College in Eagle 
Rock in 1980, Bill Harvey has made a habit of producing winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, Harvey's teams 
have won nine consecutive titles and the men have won seven of the last nine 
years. The men and women have also routinely finished in the top 10 in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division III nationals. 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey, 43, does not want much of the credit. He says the school's track 
prominence had been established long before he arrived as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Since about the time Harvey started watching the Tigers compete when he was a 
child, in fact. The Occidental men have won 38 of the 42 conference titles 
since World War II and Harvey has had a firsthand view of the success. 
</P>
<P>
He started watching Occidental track meets in 1950, when he was 4, going with 
his father, a graduate of the school who was an Amateur Athletic Union official 
assigned to the Tigers' meets. 
</P>
<P>
"If you really think about it, a lot of my life has been focused on the people 
we've had here," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
He competed as a shotputter and discus thrower at Occidental from 1963-67. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of a middle-of-the-road type," he said. "I was good enough to 
compete in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating, Harvey coached at Boca Raton High School in Florida, at 
Trinity University in San Antonio and at Canyon High in Canyon Country for 
seven years before moving on to Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
There, Harvey's teams have also dominated the SCIAC in cross-country. The women 
have won the title seven of the last nine years and the men six of the last 
nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He says the two biggest factors in the steady success may be the tradition that 
he inherited and the talented coaching staff that he has maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The staff includes Mike Deller, Andy Steben and Christel Miller. Deller has 
been an assistant with the program for 12 years, Steben for nine and Miller for 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of coaches that have been here a lot of years and you just don't 
see that much in track and field," Harvey said. "It's a very solid organization 
and the tradition's strong and we're not going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
He said the continuity in the coaching staff makes it easier to recruit. Of 
course, the tradition and academic environment don't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental women, undefeated in dual meets, have been led by Michelle 
Trimble, three-time All-American distance runner, Glenda Mitchell in the 
heptathlon and Louise Coulter in the discus and shotput. The men, also 
undefeated, feature Ben White in the long jump and triple jump, and Lionel Shaw 
in the 800- and 1,500-meter runs. 
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that the Tigers are heavily favored to win both the men's and 
women's titles again at the SCIAC championships under way this weekend at 
Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey also has high hopes for national title. Occidental has already 
qualified 15 men and women for the Division III meet May 24-27 at North Central 
in Naperville, Ill., and hopes to have 21 by the time of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Biola University of La Mirada didn't have to search far or long to find a 
replacement for Dave Holmquist, who stepped down as men's basketball coach to 
become athletic director two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The new Biola athletic director announced Monday that Howard Lyon, who has been 
a coach at the school for 17 years, has been named. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon, 61, brings impressive credentials into his position. He was coach at 
Biola from 1971-78 and co-coach with Holmquist from 1979-88, posting a 401-143 
record -- a winning percentage of .737. He has a career coaching record of 
726-276. 
</P>
<P>
At Biola, his teams have won 20 or more games 13 times and 30 or more games 
twice. He was also named National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 
III coach of the year in 1972, 1974 and 1982 and was national coach of the year 
with Holmquist in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon's teams also won five District III titles, three National Christian 
College Athletic Assn. championships and was NAIA runner-up in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I was honored when Coach Holmquist asked me to coach one of the top programs 
on the West Coast," Lyon said. "It will be a pleasant challenge for my staff 
and me to maintain the standard of play that our loyal fans have enjoyed for 
the past several seasons." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon announced that his assistants will be Harvey Tidwell, John Mayberry and 
Kirk Chittick. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question about which College Division baseball team is the hottest 
in the Southland at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five weeks, it has been Westmont of Santa Barbara. Since March 16, 
when the Warriors were 8-12, the team has won 19 of its last 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont leads the Golden State Athletic Conference at 15-5 and 27-13 overall. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
In a matchup of two of the top-ranked NCAA Division II baseball teams, 
10th-ranked Cal State Northridge and second-ranked Cal State Sacramento split a 
two-game series last weekend at Northridge. Northridge won Saturday , 2-1, and 
Sacramento won Sunday, 4-1. . . . The Cal State San Bernardino baseball team 
took a big step toward its first NCAA Division III playoff berth with a 7-5 
nonconference win over 14th-ranked Claremont-Mudd-Scripps last week. The 
Coyotes, an independent with a 24-8-1 record, also defeated Claremont, 8-4, in 
the first game of the season. San Bernardino is ranked No. 7 and Claremont No. 
16 in this week's Division III poll. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona catcher Chris Goldbach's 30-game hitting streak was snapped in 
a recent loss to Chapman but still leads the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. with a .396 batting average, 65 hits and 47 runs batted in. His 30-game 
streak was second-longest in school history, behind Larry Beardman's 31 in 
1983. . . . The CCAA has five of its six teams listed in the mid-season NCAA 
Division II men's tennis top 20 selected by the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches 
Assn. Conference leader Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is ranked No. 2, Chapman is 
No. 4, UC Riverside No. 6, Cal State Bakersfield No. 18 and Cal Poly Pomona No. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Bernardino has earned a berth in the NCAA Division III men's golf 
tournament for the third time in the program's four-year history. The four-day 
tournament will be held May 23-26 at Central College in Pella, Iowa. The 
ninth-ranked Coyotes finished third last year.

TEXAS PITCHER SETS HIGH SCHOOL RECORD WITH HIS 51ST CONSECUTIVE VICTORY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brenham's Jon Peters pitched the fifth no-hitter of his career and remained 
unbeaten as a high school pitcher Friday night, winning his 51st game and 
setting a national record for consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
Peters struck out 11 in five innings and ended the game on a dramatic note by 
driving in the final run in a 10-0 victory over A&amp;M Consolidated. Peters' 
fifth-inning single ended the game on the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
Peters broke the record of 50 consecutive victories by Timmy Moore of McColl, 
S.C., who attended the record-breaking game and threw out the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought we'd come this far to break this record," Peters said after 
being mobbed by his teammates at first base. "I'm just glad it's over. Now 
maybe we can relax and just play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a chance at another state championship and that's what we're 
aiming for now." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs have won an unprecedented three consecutive Class 4-A titles. 
</P>
<P>
Moore set the record in 1977-80, pitching for McColl, but he didn't know he had 
a national record until last year when Peters' streak was publicized 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Peters tied Moore's record April 21 when he pitched a two-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, who has signed a scholarship agreement with Texas A&amp;M, has not lost 
a game since the final game of his Little League career when Brenham lost to 
Taiwan in the semifinals of the 1985 Little League World Series.

CARL'S JR. JUMPS OUT OF THE FAT, INTO LIGHT OILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl's Jr. is getting an oil change. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-food chain announced this week that it is testing cholesterol-free 
french fries, zucchini and onion rings in its 30 San Diego restaurants. The 
outlets are cooking all of their fried products in a blend of corn and soybean 
oil, rather than an animal-vegetable blend, a saturated fat that generally is 
considered less healthy. 
</P>
<P>
If enough customers sink their teeth into the lower-fat food, the Anaheim-based 
chain says it will switch to vegetable oil in all 490 of its stores. 
</P>
<P>
The test program makes Carl Karcher Enterprises, operator of Carl's Jr, the 
latest fast-food chain trying to capitalize on consumers' supposed growing 
desire to eat their way to better health. Over the past year or so, just about 
every fast-food chain has at least tried offering low-fat, no-fat or 
cholesterol-free menu items. 
</P>
<P>
Heightened consumer fears about how much fat is in food persuaded Blimpie -- 
the chain known for its submarine sandwiches heaped with cold-cuts and 
mayonnaise -- to announce this week that it will test salads and a low-cal 
version of its sandwiches in Georgia this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Long John Silver, which has long sold deep-fried, battered fish, has added a 
broiled variety to stores in many locations. And within the past year or so, 
McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell and Hardee's all have switched to frying at 
least some of their menu items in vegetable shortenings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a definite trend in the industry," said Howard Hansen, a restaurant 
analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. With American demographics 
generally shifting toward older customers, fast-food chains "have to widen the 
menus and offer what could be perceived as healthier items," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change at the Colonel's 
</P>
<P>
The down-with-cholesterol movement has become as much an effort to keep up with 
the competition as to bring in new customers with new offerings. 
</P>
<P>
The Colonel's Kentucky Fried Chicken, for instance, this month will start 
testing char-broiled chicken in the Southwest to attract the calorie-conscious 
as well as to avoid losing market share to competitors such as El Pollo Loco or 
El Pollo Asada. 
</P>
<P>
El Pollo Loco Corp. of La Mirada now claims 21.9% of the convenience restaurant 
chicken market in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While the market for char-broiled chicken is comparatively small now, Kentucky 
Fried doesn't want to get grilled by the competition. "Clearly, we wouldn't 
want someone to come in and preempt the segment," said Gregg Reynolds, 
spokesman for Kentucky Fried Chicken. "It would be stupid for us to be caught 
unaware." 
</P>
<P>
Being a late-comer to the crusade may have, in fact, cost Carl's Jr. some 
sales. "It's too early to tell. We really won't know until the end of May when 
the test is finished and we see" if people prefer the less-fatty foods, said 
spokeswoman Patty Beckman. The hamburger chain was late to jump on the 
bandwagon because it needed time to make the switch for all of its fried 
products. 
</P>
<P>
But if the lower-fat items catch on, the results can be dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Hardee's, the nation's third-largest fast-food burger chain, for example, has 
seen sales climb 25% since June, when it began frying its chicken, turnovers, 
fries and fish in a 100% vegetable blend of soybean and peanut oil. The company 
traces the gain to the switch from beef tallow, a saturated fat that raises 
cholesterol levels in blood. 
</P>
<P>
But healthier products do not always guarantee fatter profits. 
</P>
<P>
At Carl's Jr., the cooking oil switch means tampering with a formula that its 
customers know. "People will be able to taste the natural flavor of the potato 
more now," insists Beckman. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. But McDonald's and Burger King both say they have resisted using 100% 
vegetable shortening -- which can cost 30% more than an animal blend -- to cook 
fries because their customers prefer the taste of the fattier foods. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's International Inc. found that out the hard way. The hamburger chain 
four years ago offered a "Light Menu" with such items as tuna-stuffed tomatoes, 
only to find that customers wouldn't buy it. Instead, the chain discovered that 
people buy based on taste -- and don't always purchase what they say they 
prefer. 
</P>
<P>
Take Sande Ippolito, 38, of Huntington Beach, who exercises to keep fit and 
tries to avoid fast foods: "You're not going to sell me a Blimpie light," she 
says. "If I'm being sinful enough to eat an eclair, I don't want to know that 
it's light. That doesn't help me at all." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, say health professionals, low-cholesterol fast-foods are not all 
that much healthier for you, unless you eat fried foods in large quantities. 
</P>
<P>
"If you hang out" at a fast-food restaurant on a daily basis, yes, you're 
probably going to be more benefited by a change in cooking oil more than 
someone who only eats there once a week," said Carol Floyd of the American 
Heart Assn. National Center in Dallas. "But we'd prefer people not consume 
deep-fried items. Period." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
dFAST FOOD IS SLIMMING DOWN 
</P>
<P>
BURGER KING: Switched two years ago to 100% vegetable oil for chicken products, 
French toast, and onion rings. Still uses a blend of beef tallow and cotton 
seed oil for fries. 
</P>
<P>
McDONALD'S: Switched to vegetable oil for fish fillets, McNuggets, pies. Still 
uses animal/vegetable fat blend for fries and other potato products. 
</P>
<P>
EL POLLO LOCO: Working on new recipe for lower-fat beans. Menu shows items 
prepared according to American Heart Assn. recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN: Has used vetegable shortening since 1939. About to 
test-market grilled chicken. Experimented with -- and rejected -- roast 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
TACO BELL:Switched to a vegetable oil and stopped frying its taco shells in 
coconut oil in 1987.

MILKEN VOWS TO HELP REVIVE DYING SHIPYARD; 
</P>
<P>
ROLE UNCLEAR; DEAL DATES TO SEVERAL MONTHS AGO 
</P>

<P>
Michael Milken, the "junk bond" financier who is fighting federal racketeering 
and fraud charges, has vowed to join another battle: raising money to revive a 
dying Massachusetts shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who was charged last month in a 98-count indictment capping an 
extensive government investigation, made a surprise appearance Thursday before 
700 former shipyard workers at the Sons of Italy hall here. 
</P>
<P>
Milken told the group that he and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment 
firm that has agreed to dismiss him, could easily secure the millions of 
dollars in capital and bonds needed to finance an employee-owned shipbuilding 
and repair operation at Quincy's Fore River shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
"By June 30, the money will be lined up for the yard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he would help with the shipbuilding venture, but his role in the 
venture was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a personal spokesman for Milken and an official speaking on behalf 
of Drexel appeared to disagree over Milken's current role in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreed to Disassociate 
</P>
<P>
The firm has agreed to disassociate itself from Milken under an April 13 
landmark civil fraud agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
settling charges including insider trading. Milken also would be barred from 
any business dealings with Drexel employees. 
</P>
<P>
The pact, signed April 13, is pending approval by a federal judge, but Drexel 
already has placed Milken on a leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
The Drexel official said Milken was "peripherally" involved in the shipyard 
financing deal several months ago, before the firm agreed to settle government 
charges against it. But the spokesman said Milken "is not working on the deal 
now and is not involved in it." 
</P>
<P>
Milken spokesman Kenneth Lerer confirmed that Milken appeared at the Rockland 
meeting "as a private citizen" and that he is continuing to play an active role 
on behalf of the union in structuring the deal. "He has a commitment to do as 
much as he can to help the union revive the shipyard," Lerer said. 
</P>
<P>
Lerer said he wasn't certain how much contact, if any, Milken would have with 
Drexel in structuring the deal. He noted that the SEC settlement hadn't gone 
into effect yet, adding that Milken personally isn't bound by it.

Unilever Drops Faberge Deal: Unilever, the European consumer products 
conglomerate, said it has dropped plans to purchase the Faberge and Elizabeth 
Arden lines of toiletries, cosmetics and fragrances for $1.55 billion from 
Riklis Family Corp. Negotiations broke down because the Riklis group sought 
"significant changes in the structure and terms of the transaction, which would 
have involved Unilever in substantial additional costs," according to Unilever 
United States Inc., the U.S. arm of the British-Dutch household and consumer 
products giant. Among some of the name brands of Faberge and its independent 
subsidiary, Elizabeth Arden, are Chloe, Lagerfeld, Aqua Net and Brut.

DRABINSKY MAY TRY A BUYOUT OF CINEPLEX; 
</P>
<P>
PUTTING CHAIN 'IN PLAY' RUNS RISK OF HIGHER BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Thwarted in his plans to acquire control of Cineplex Odeon Corp. with a private 
purchase of stock, company Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky indicated Friday that 
his investor group may try to take the firm private by making an offer for all 
of the Cineplex shares that they currently do not own. 
</P>
<P>
Drabinsky's move effectively puts Cineplex "in play," some analysts said, due 
to the risk that a higher bidder may step forward. 
</P>
<P>
For 40-year-old Drabinsky, however, the gamble may be his best chance of 
retaining the helm of the movie theater concern that he helped found 10 years 
ago. The Cineplex chairman appears to have lost the confidence of his two 
largest shareholders, MCA Inc. and Canada's Charles R. Bronfman family, which 
together own 79% of the company's equity. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three weeks, the Bronfman clan tried to sell its 30% stake to 
Drabinsky in a private deal. But MCA -- which owns 49% -- objected vehemently 
to the Cineplex board, in court and at the Quebec Securities Commission, saying 
Drabinsky should be required to make the same offer to all shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the battle, an MCA vice president swore in a court affidavit 
that MCA and Bronfman representatives on the Cineplex board had been "extremely 
critical of the management of Cineplex . . . particularly with respect to the 
financial reporting practices and procedures which management followed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valued at $709 Million 
</P>
<P>
Quebec regulators twice rebuffed the private sale, and on Thursday -- after a 
renewed threat of legal action by MCA -- the Bronfmans and Drabinsky group 
abruptly abandoned a third effort to win the commission's approval. On Friday, 
the two groups acknowledged that they had dropped the transaction "by mutual 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The bid for the Bronfman stake suggests that Drabinsky has assigned a value of 
at least $709 million to the total company, or $14.76 per share. Those figures 
approximate the $17.50 (Canadian) price that he agreed to pay for each of the 
Bronfman shares. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, Cineplex shares rose 87.5 cents to close at 
$14.125, with a volume of 1.02 million shares traded. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Toronto-based Cineplex said it had been notified that 
Drabinsky and other members of his group "are exploring with their advisers the 
possibility of making a proposal" for all of the shares they do not own. 
</P>
<P>
The news was greeted with skepticism in some quarters, because some analysts 
and lenders contend that the company is already too debt-laden to finance a 
leveraged buyout. At year-end, Cineplex reported $664 million in long-term 
debt, although it recently sold a major Florida asset for $150 million to 
reduce the debt. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't finance the deal. Already they can't cover their debt," contended 
one hedge-fund manager who is "short" on the stock -- betting the price of 
Cineplex shares will fall. "The whole idea of an LBO is the 'L' for leveraged, 
and they've already got it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Buyer Possible 
</P>
<P>
A banker who lends to movie theater companies also predicted privately that 
financing a Cineplex buyout "would be very difficult to do."

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: SOME WAYS TO WEATHER THE NEXT U.S. RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A recession is coming, many economists warn. If, for once, they aren't crying 
wolf, will you be ready? 
</P>
<P>
This may be just as good a time as any to begin assessing your personal 
finances and investments, preparing for when the inevitable slump hits. Many 
experts warn that a downturn may come later this year or early next year, 
pointing to recent declines in factory orders and housing starts, sluggish 
retail sales and flat industrial production. 
</P>
<P>
While these experts have sounded false alarms before, a downturn will come 
sooner or later; the expansion is now into its seventh year, a peacetime 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no foolproof ways to get rich in recessions, here are some 
general common sense suggestions to conserve what you have in hard times: 
</P>
<P>
* Save up. In normal times, many financial experts say, you want enough cash or 
cash equivalents to support at least three to six months of living expenses for 
you and whoever you support. If you think you may lose your job or suffer other 
financial hardships in a recession, six to 12 months of reserves might be 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Money market funds and brokered certificates of deposit are simple, safe, 
high-yielding investments that serve as great cash equivalents because they 
generally can be converted easily into cash. You also can tap precious metals, 
collectibles, real estate or other "hard" assets, but in a recession these 
assets may not fetch as much as you paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
If you still don't have enough savings, start a forced savings plan through 
which you automatically set aside 10% to 15% of your income. If you want some 
of that money to go into stocks or stock mutual funds, use "dollar cost 
averaging," in which you invest a set amount at set intervals, regardless of 
what happens to the market. 
</P>
<P>
"This is sensible anytime, but particularly in a recession," says Mitchell 
Keil, a financial planner at IDS Financial Services in Irvine. In a recession, 
he notes, the stock market tends to be volatile, making "timing" ups and downs 
difficult even for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut debt and spending. If saving seems to be difficult, do a cash flow 
analysis to review your spending habits. List all your income for a given month 
and then all your expenditures. If the expenses exceed the income, look for 
ways to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
Also, ask yourself whether you really need any large, discretionary purchases 
you are considering, such as a new car, boat or vacation home. William F. 
Brennan, head of the financial planning practice in Washington for the 
accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney, says he recently persuaded a client not 
to buy a vacation home. The client will, instead, rent. 
</P>
<P>
As for debt, Brennan suggests as a general rule of thumb that, for hard times, 
you generally don't want your annual debt load to exceed 25% of your income. In 
good times, 33% is appropriate, he says. 
</P>
<P>
If you need help managing your debts and setting up a budget, reputable 
low-cost credit counseling services are available from Consumer Credit 
Counselors, a nonprofit organization with 400 offices nationwide. For 
referrals, call (213) 386-7601 in Los Angeles County, (714) 547-8281 in Orange 
County, (619) 224-2922 in San Diego County and (714) 781-0114 in Riverside 
County. Elsewhere, call the National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Silver 
Spring, Md., at (301) 589-5600. 
</P>
<P>
* Get recession-buster stocks and funds. If you knew the exact timing of a 
recession, you should get out of equities entirely during the first part. 
That's because stocks generally decline in the first half of a recession, then 
pick up once the bottom passes and investor optimism grows. 
</P>
<P>
In the eight postwar recessions, stocks bottomed on average about 6 1/2 months 
into the slumps, according to a study by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Those 
slumps lasted an average of 11 months, meaning that stocks were rising the last 
4 1/2 months, on average. 
</P>
<P>
But because even the pros aren't able to predict an exact middle point -- or 
starting point, for that matter -- it's wise not to try to "time" the recession 
yourself by selling all your stocks now. Instead, adjust your portfolio to 
emphasize stocks and funds that hold up better when all else is falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
One good bet would be blue chip stocks that pay high dividends and enjoy 
relatively stable revenue, such as utilities and food companies. High dividend 
payments will act as a cushion against stock price declines. 
</P>
<P>
Geraldine Weiss, editor of Investment Quality Trends, a La Jolla newsletter, 
also recommends companies that maintain low or no debt. They will best be able 
to handle financial pressures when business conditions flounder. She points to 
16 "royal blue chip" companies with no debt whatsoever. They are American Home 
Products, Betz Laboratories, A. T. Cross, Dreyfus Corp., Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 
International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, Jefferson Pilot, Lance Inc., Longs Drug 
Stores, Marion Laboratories, McGraw-Hill, Noxell Corp., Tambrands, Thomas 
Industries, Weis Markets and Wm. Wrigley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
If mutual funds are your bag, there are a number of funds with proven track 
records of performing well in downturns. Sheldon Jacobs, editor and publisher 
of No-Load Fund Investor, a newsletter in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., recommends 
Wellesley Income (800-662-7447); Lindner Dividend (314-727-5305); Mutual Shares 
(800-448-3863); Nicholas Fund (414-272-6133); Neuberger &amp; Berman Partners 
(800-367-0770), and Mathers (800-962-3863). 
</P>
<P>
Once a recession has bottomed, however, be prepared to invest in stock groups 
with a history of price appreciation in such periods. Groups showing the best 
performance coming off recession lows include companies in manufactured 
housing, leisure time, pollution control, savings and loans, and hotel and 
motel operators, a survey by Standard &amp; Poor's contends. Each of those 
groups has risen on average more than 50% in the six months from the recession 
lows of the S&amp;P 500-stock index, says Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard 
&amp; Poor's Outlook newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
* Shift some bonds into higher-quality issues. When the economy goes to hell, 
investors usually flee to quality. That boosts prices of the safest issues, 
such as Treasury securities, relative to the less safe, such as high-yield 
"junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case in the days immediately following the October, 1987, stock 
market crash, when recession fears sparked price rises in Treasury securities 
but declines in junk bonds. Investors reasoned that junk bonds could default in 
much larger numbers in a downturn as companies that issue them suffer declines 
in profits and revenues. A resurgence of recession fears recently led prices of 
many junk issues to decline by as much as 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean you should junk your junk? Not necessarily. No one knows for 
sure what the default rate might be in a recession, since the relatively new 
junk bond market has yet to weather a full-blown one, and no one knows how long 
or severe the downturn will be. The default rate could be only 5% or it could 
be far higher than 10%, up from about 2% now, according to most experts. If the 
default rate isn't too high, the higher yields of a diversified portfolio of 
junk bonds will continue to offset any losses from defaults. 
</P>
<P>
The key is not to have all of your money in junk. And make sure you invest in 
junk bond mutual funds, not individual issues, because the diversification of a 
fund will help you weather defaults in individual issues. 
</P>
<P>
* Prepare to go long. Usually a few months into a recession, interest rates 
decline. When that happens, the best investments may be longer-term bonds, such 
as 10- to 30-year Treasury issues or mutual funds that invest in them. They 
will gain in value as interest rates decline because people will pay more for 
investments offering higher rates than can be obtained on new investments. And 
you can lock in their higher yields.

FORMER ENEMIES MEET ON A DIFFERENT KIND OF SHOOT

<P>
Three Vietnamese men, dressed impeccably in brown and gray business suits, 
emerged from the dense jungle foliage and surveyed the war-torn remains of a 
makeshift Viet Cong camp. A smoldering campfire nearby indicated guerrilla 
soldiers had recently fled the area -- perhaps retreating from invading 
American forces. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three men spotted a hammock gently swaying between two trees and 
walked over to it. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no," muttered Vietnamese film director Nguyen Hong Sen, speaking 
through an interpreter. He untied one end of the hammock and deftly formed a 
new knot. "You tie it this way, so water from tree does not run down onto man 
sleeping. Also, makes quick release when Americans come." 
</P>
<P>
Sen, a former Viet Cong fighter in Southeast Asia, jerked the string and the 
hammock fell easily to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Where were you when we shot the film?" asked American TV-film director and 
Vietnam War veteran Patrick Duncan with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Sen and his companions -- Nguyen Thu, general director of the Vietnamese Film 
Department, and Hai Hinh, head of the Hanoi Film Department -- had been invited 
by Duncan to visit the set of "The Last Soldier," this season's final episode 
of HBO's critically acclaimed "Vietnam War Story," for a first-hand impression 
of American film making. The three Vietnamese film makers were in town to 
participate in a symposium of American and Vietnamese film makers at UCLA's 
Melnitz Hall on Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Before the UCLA event, the Vietnamese film makers, guided by Duncan, picked 
their way through the war-weary set, displaying alternating senses of wonder 
and amusement. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling, 4,000-acre spread of land in Newhall is a bamboo, fiberglass and 
plaster-of-Paris re-creation of Vietnam, with lush jungles, a flowing 
reed-lined river, man-made swampland, thatched villages, a U.S. Army base camp 
and a scaled-down version of Saigon. In addition to "War Story," the area can 
be seen weekly as a backdrop for CBS-TV's "Tour of Duty" and in Duncan's recent 
film about Vietnam, "84 Charlie Mopic." 
</P>
<P>
"This location provides a lot of variety. Everything here, you also see in 
Vietnam," Sen said while looking out over the Santa Clara River, which snakes 
through the set. He stooped down, picked some tall wild grass growing on the 
shoreline, examined it and stuck it in his shirt pocket like a carnation. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you have the means," he said. "When we film war movie about Vietnam we 
need what you have here -- helicopters and buildings and sets. Next time we do 
a movie about Vietnam War we should come here to film it." 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, where 20 to 25 feature films are shot each year -- more than 500 
were shot last year in the United States -- all that is available is crude and 
outdated film technology. Thu said Vietnamese films are government approved, 
often government funded and shot mostly on low-quality, black-and-white East 
German film stock, which is all they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
The price of admission to a movie in Vietnam is 15 cents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All our films are developed by the artist, based upon the needs of the whole 
country," Thu said. "There is a government committee that approves films, but 
after that film makers are given absolute freedom to do as they wish." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan first met the Vietnamese film makers last year at the Hawaiian Film 
Festival in Honolulu. "84 Charlie Mopic" was screening on the USS Arizona War 
Memorial the same time as Sen's film, "The Abandoned Field -- Free Fire Zone," 
the story of a young Vietnamese couple who work as liaisons for the Viet Cong 
in the marshes of the Mekong Delta while being relentlessly pursued by American 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
As Duncan raced across the hall to catch "The Abandoned Field," he literally 
ran into Sen, who was rushing the opposite way to watch Duncan's film. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an honor to bring these people over here," Duncan said. "Some of them 
I fought against. Some of their depictions of Americans in their films are 
pretty harsh. But their films moved me. You have to look at what we do to them 
in our films. Nobody knows better than the combat soldier that the enemy is 
just like himself." 
</P>
<P>
"In American war films, the presence of the Vietnamese is symbolic," said Ninh, 
who had seen Oliver Stone's "Platoon," Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" 
and several episodes of "War Story." "The purpose of those films is to portray 
American soldiers, not Vietnamese soldiers. American films make Vietnamese look 
simplistic. But that's the same thing we do to Americans in our film, because 
we never had an opportunity before to exchange ideas." 
</P>
<P>
"In 'The Abandoned Field,' the American character is a devil-like figure who 
wears a goatee. The character is played by a Euro-Asian who makes a lot of 
ferocious faces," said Geoffrey Gilmore, director of film and television 
programming for the UCLA Film and Television Archive, who traveled to Vietnam 
last year and selected six war-related films for the Vietnam film festival at 
UCLA this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The films we showed (at the festival) spanned from 1979 to 1987," he said. 
"You see a change of tone from the older to the more recent features. They're 
looser, less simplistic and sharper in their ability to be critical of the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
As Duncan led the Vietnamese film makers through the set, they paused over some 
Vietnamese headstones. Duncan reached down and picked one up; it was made of 
Styrofoam. Although Sen argued that the headstones were too high and narrow to 
be real North Vietnamese headstones, "War Story" Vietnam technical adviser Kieu 
Chinh was on hand to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"They are higher so they can be seen by the camera," said Chinh, 49, who was a 
well-known actress and film producer in Vietnam before fleeing to the United 
States in 1975. "This is a very sensitive job. I understand Vietnam, but I also 
understand films. Sometimes the truth and film making have to be combined. 
</P>
<P>
"I am careful to make sure Vietnamese are presented accurately. On 'War Story' 
we use only Vietnamese actors. Other television shows and films use Japanese 
and Chinese to portray Vietnamese." 
</P>
<P>
As the visiting film makers headed away from the Vietnam set, accompanied by 
Duncan and several actors and crew members, they crossed through the middle of 
a scene being filmed 100 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"Quick, drop down!" the director bellowed at them through a bullhorn. 
</P>
<P>
The entire group, Vietnamese and Americans, dropped to their knees on the dusty 
road to avoid being shot, even if only by a television camera. Nobody moved for 
a full minute, enveloped by the silence of the mock Vietnamese jungle. 
</P>
<P>
"Cut!" the director yelled. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese stood, shook hands with their American guests and piled into a 
van heading back to the city.RANDY LEFFINGWELL / Los Angeles Times

VIETNAMESE-U.S. FILM SYMPOSIUM STIRS PASSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Vietnam War swirled anew at UCLA Thursday night as Vietnamese and American 
film makers confronted an audience for whom the war has not yet ended. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 angry protesters shouted chants and waved red and yellow Vietnamese 
nationalist flags outside the 270-seat Melnitz Hall, while inside Vietnamese 
and American film and television producers tried to explain their depictions of 
Vietnam to a crowd that ranged from warmly receptive to antagonistic. 
</P>
<P>
One conclusion drawn by the eight panelists at the symposium on "Images of 
Vietnam: A Dialogue Between Vietnamese and American Film Makers" was that film 
makers need to move away from combat-oriented films and explore human issues 
that deal with how the war affected people in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
The turbulent session began an hour late, as audience members from the packed 
house were required to pass through metal detectors and were frisked by state 
police because of a reported gun threat. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium capped off "The Vietnam Film Project," a series of six films from 
Vietnam presented at UCLA earlier this month. The project was organized by the 
UCLA Film and Television Archive; the U.S. Committee for Scientific Cooperation 
With Vietnam, based in Madison, Wis.; the East-West Center in Honolulu and the 
Asia Society in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In a clear demonstration that the North-South Vietnam conflict has not ended 
for Vietnamese living in this country, Vietnamese crowd members inside the 
auditorium used the microphone to deliver sharp blasts against Nguyen Thu, 
general director of the Vietnamese Film Department; Hai Ninh, director of the 
Hanoi Film Studio, and film director Nguyen Hong Sen. 
</P>
<P>
Harsh comments were also hurled at American film maker and panelist Oliver 
Stone, who directed the Academy Award-winning "Platoon" and the upcoming "Born 
on the Fourth of July," about the outspoken Vietnam veteran and activist Ron 
Kovic, who was in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
After viewing film clips from each producer on the panel, the panelists talked 
about the significance of Vietnam in film and television. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam was the most important experience in my life," said Steven Smith, 
co-producer and writer for CBS' Vietnam series "Tour of Duty." "It never goes 
away. It's in you. When I feel I can't write another word about Vietnam, 
something else comes up. You can never exhaust the material because everyone 
there has a personal story or tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
"Reaching across the battlefield and connecting with that other person as a 
human being is the greatest challenge of any film maker," agreed producer Bill 
Broyles of ABC's "China Beach." "Sure, there were bombs and explosions. But the 
most powerful thing in Vietnam was the enemy. He's the one who lighted the 
Zippo or pulled the trigger. We have to portray both sides of the enemy line." 
</P>
<P>
The first indication of the storm brewing in the auditorium audience -- made up 
in part of Vietnamese student protesters, as well as several prominent Vietnam 
activists, including Pentagon Papers figure Anthony Russo -- occurred when Kieu 
Chinh, a former actress in Vietnam now living in Studio City, decried what she 
said was the omission of the South Vietnamese in American films. 
</P>
<P>
"As Vietnamese film actress, to be honest, I was little bit disappointed with 
stories told (in American Vietnam films)," she said in measured words, speaking 
as a lone voice for the scores of protesters, many of whom were disabled 
Vietnamese veterans, who continued making anti-communist chants in a 
candlelight vigil outside. "I was born in North Vietnam, and I witnessed the 
war. But never have I seen the South Vietnamese portrayed in your film 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
The audience erupted in emotional applause, as Chinh stood and bowed slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think somehow soldiers have forgotten the comrades they fought with side by 
side for so many years. . . ," she continued, still standing. "I only hope in 
the future wave of films about war, film audiences will see human beings in 
Vietnam, instead of cliches about prostitutes and mama-sans." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the comments of the Vietnamese film makers, who spoke through an 
interpreter, were lost in the translation. Overwhelmingly, they conveyed a 
peaceful message, one of optimism and an appreciation for the opportunity to 
open the channels of communication between the two historically divided 
countries by sharing film, which Chinh called a "language that transcends 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to create a dialogue here that will help us to get to know each other 
better," Thu said. "The more we can share, the more we can understand. . . . 
All our energies are focused on changes in Vietnam. I hope the films we show 
you reflect those changes." 
</P>
<P>
Once the microphone was turned over to the audience, however, exacerbated 
Vietnamese protesters lashed out at the panelists in both English and 
Vietnamese, prompting verbal exchanges between those in the audience and 
causing English-speaking members of the crowd to cry out for faster 
translations. 
</P>
<P>
Intensifying the emotion was the date of the symposium: two days before the 
anniversary of the fall of Saigon on April 29, 1975, which signalled the end of 
the war. (The panel discussion initially was to have followed the Vietnamese 
film festival, but the Vietnamese film makers were not able to clear their 
visas with the State Department in time and the event had to be rescheduled.) 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, arsonists set fire to a pickup truck in front of the 
Westminster editorial offices of the Vietnamese-language Nguoi Viet Daily News 
and scrawled a threat in Vietnamese saying, "Nguou Viet. If you are VC (Viet 
Cong). We Kill," officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Vietnam in 1979," Quang Dang defiantly shouted into the microphone, his 
voice quavering. "I think in the United States, film producer has the right to 
do whatever he wants -- say 'Down with Reagan,' and then go home at night and 
sleep safely. . . . Not in Vietnam! I had chance to see communist film. Police 
locked the doors and forced us to watch the whole film! That's still common 
practice in Vietnam!" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any country in the world that forces people to watch films," 
Thu responded. He drew jeers when he said that Vietnamese directors may make 
whatever kind of film they like once the concept is approved by the government. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you understand what the life and reality is in Vietnam when you live 
over here?" Thu asked the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"These films were not made by puppets," Stone affirmed. "They were made by 
artists." 
</P>
<P>
One protester bitterly challenged Stone to present the real Vietnam and make a 
film or documentary about the Vietnamese re-education camps. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Stone burst out: "I don't know why you people think you have a 
monopoly on anger and truth! I can turn the tables; you're not the only people 
in the world that have experienced suffering. . . . You go on and on about your 
victims. When are you going to find the love in your heart to forgive and move 
on?" 
</P>
<P>
"The war is over," said Patrick Duncan, Vietnam veteran and director of the 
feature film "84 Charlie Mopic" and a producer for the HBO "Vietnam War Story" 
series. "It's a wound and it's time to heal it. These films I saw from these 
Vietnamese gentlemen helped to heal my wounds from the war. Those who see them 
only as communists, please go see their movies." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the two-hour forum, police led the audience out a side exit to 
avoid conflict with demonstrators in front of the building who had already 
thrown objects at one visiting Vietnamese man when he pushed a nationalist 
Vietnamese flag out of his path to get by. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to begin to see these people who were once our enemies as potential 
friends," Kovic said quietly from his wheelchair as he waited outside the 
theater. "Even though I was paralyzed from the chest down, I harbor no 
bitterness or hatred. We have to reach out with love and understanding and deal 
with a complex and highly emotional war. We need to find friendship where there 
was only suffering and pain."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: FINDING SOME FAULTS IN KABC'S 'QUAKEBUSTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
No more sand in the face for KABC-TV Channel 7, which now finds itself in the 
unaccustomed position of trailing first-place KNBC Channel 4 in the local news 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Time to get tough. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Channel 7 began the May ratings sweeps (which inevitably begin at 
the end of April) with a huge tremor that could be described as earthshaking. 
</P>
<P>
Always providing more than its share of theater, "Eyewitness News" this time 
crossed into entertainment with a brazenness said to have shocked and 
distressed even many of its own staffers. 
</P>
<P>
What's next, 3-D news? 
</P>
<P>
Performed by its very own "Eyewitness News" actors in the studio and in the 
field, plus a supporting cast of hundreds, Channel 7's newest and most 
outrageous theatrical production yet was "Quakebusters," an extended, live 
simulation of an earthquake disaster that consumed about half of the 4, 5 and 6 
p.m. newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between real news, each of these half-hour dramatizations 
represented a different day of make-believe earthquake coverage, and to Channel 
7's credit, each was continuously labeled "simulation" in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The credit ended there. 
</P>
<P>
With Jerry Dunphy and Marianne Banister watching from the real anchor desk, 
weathercaster Dr. George Fischbeck kicked off "Quakebusters" by saying that the 
key to survival of the "big one" is "awareness and planning." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the day's coverage "may look real," but it's "only a drill." Some 
of us have suspected that about "Eyewitness News" for years. 
</P>
<P>
It was time to raise the curtain. Cut to anchorman Paul Moyer, in his 
shirt-sleeves, at the "earthquake desk." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Paul Moyer in the 'Eyewitness' newsroom. A very strong earthquake shook 
the Southland just a short time ago. So far we don't know really how big it 
was. But I can tell you one thing -- our studio here in Hollywood shook for 
about three minutes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Cut to reporter John North in the field, in front of rubble, reporting "three 
or four injuries here." One of the injured was in a pickup, other people were 
on the ground. "I live in a building a couple of doors down," a worried woman 
told North. 
</P>
<P>
Back to Moyer. "We advise you to please stay calm," he said before a 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Again back to Moyer. "Information is beginning to come in." The screen was 
filled with overhead shots of fires as Moyer used such words as overwhelming 
and widespread to describe the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Now to reporter Marc Brown in the field, in front of fire trucks, talking to a 
department spokesman. "We know the fire department is stretched pretty thin 
right now. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Back to Moyer, with news that the quake registered 8.3 on the Richter scale. 
"It's now very clear, the so-called 'big one' has indeed struck Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Now to reporter Mark Coogan in field, interviewing a family. "Folks, how are 
you and how are things inside?" 
</P>
<P>
Back to Moyer, who reported "at least 50 deaths" as the screen filled with the 
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
Now to reporter Harold Greene in the field, bending over a bloodied victim at a 
makeshift treatment center. "What happened to you, sir?" he asked. "The 
hot-water heater exploded," the groaning victim replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people here appear to be in shock," Greene reported. 
</P>
<P>
Now to Bob Banfield in the field, waiting for the injured to emerge from a 
collapsed building in San Bernadino. One man was being carried. "This person 
here lost a limb," Banfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Back to Moyer. "The death toll is now at least 270. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The 4 p.m. newscast's "Day One" coverage ended with Ann Martin previewing the 5 
p.m. newscast and saying: "The aim of all of what we're doing today is to help 
you get ready for an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
A second opinion: The primary aim of "Quakebusters" was to hype the ratings 
(which it apparently did; all three newscasts outdrew the competition on KNBC 
and KCBS Channel 2). In the process, it elevated entertainment far, far above 
news. 
</P>
<P>
The reporters in the field worked survival tips into their "coverage," so there 
was no question that good information was available from "Quakebusters." But 
this was the stuff of an entertainment program, not a newscast. News should be 
reported, not scripted and acted out. 
</P>
<P>
As this was theater, a review of the performances seems in order: 
</P>
<P>
Beyond a doubt, Moyer gave his finest performance in his most challenging role, 
conveying concern and urgency so convincingly that you'd think he was a real 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Although Greene tended to overact, one could only marvel at his pacing and 
interaction, while North, Brown, Coogan and Banfield were believable enough to 
have you on the edge of your seat. 
</P>
<P>
What a cast! 
</P>
<P>
The anchors switched for the 5 p.m. newscast, with Moyer, now in his jacket, 
taking over as the real anchor beside Martin, and Dunphy, with his tie 
loosened, now sitting at the "earthquake desk" for simulated "Day Two." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the real news reported by Moyer and Martin ("What if you were driving 
and suddenly the street fell in. . .") looked and sounded like the simulated 
news that Moyer had reported in the previous hour, further merging fantasy and 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
And there on cue to introduce "Day Two" was Dr. George. "Oh, boy!" he exclaimed 
about "Quakebusters," "It's never been done before." 
</P>
<P>
With good reason. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine a self-respecting news organization doing something like 
this. Come to think of it, no self-respecting news organization did.

WALKS ON THE WILD SIDE AT EL DORADO NATURE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhat eccentric, as befits a wildlife refuge smack in the middle of "Iowa by 
the Sea," the El Dorado Nature Center in Long Beach is an oasis surrounded by 
suburbia, freeways and the San Gabriel River. 
</P>
<P>
Its almost 85 acres contain two lakes, a stream, three miles of trails, an 
eclectic mix of plants from around the world, plenty of birds and animals and a 
small museum. 
</P>
<P>
What you see after passing through the refuge gates makes you feel a long way 
from city center although, unfortunately, you never quite get away from the 
sound of traffic. Yet, out by the reedy South Lake frequented by coots, ducks 
and herons, you can almost forget that the San Gabriel River Freeway is just 
out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Today and Sunday, the Nature Center will host a snake, turtle and amphibian 
show from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and next month the refuge will celebrate its 20th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we're trying to do in the birthday celebration is to pull 
together the history of the place," Mary Blackburn, Nature Center program 
director, said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Municipal Weed Patch' 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, before its development, the Nature Center site was known as 
"the Municipal Weed Patch." The land had been part of the San Gabriel River's 
flood plain, then was farmed as bean fields after the river was channelized. 
The Nature Center is part of El Dorado Park, one of the country's largest city 
parks with more than 700 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The wildlife refuge's hills were built with dirt displaced by the San Gabriel 
River Freeway. The center headquarters, which contains the museum, sits on an 
island reached by bridges. Walk the refuge trails today and you go from 
Northern Wisconsin to Australia and Africa because of the strange mix of 
plants, Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million people have visited the Nature Center, Blackburn said. On 
the average weekend, about 500 drop by to hike and relax. About 1,000 people, 
including 75 to 100 who'll be briefly acknowledged for their help over the 
years, are expected at the birthday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn runs the Nature Center's many programs, which include elementary 
school tours, church and Scout meetings and classes for young children, 
families and adults. Concerts and poetry readings are also scheduled for the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
When children first visit the Nature Center, Blackburn said, "we find a lot of 
times that this is (their) first experience with something other than concrete. 
What we want to do is spark their awareness that there are critters out there 
-- the interdependence of all living things." 
</P>
<P>
Through the Nature Center's example, Blackburn says, she wants to teach 
children that "they can create wildlife habitat where there wasn't wildlife 
habitat before. And that's real important as we eat up the land." 
</P>
<P>
The birthday celebration, scheduled May 13 from noon to 4 p.m., will include 
tours, live-animal exhibits, natural-history and memorabilia displays, the 
National Forest Service's "Woodsy the Owl" character, a brief ceremony, harp 
music and a cake cutting. Also on May 13, a bird walk will be led by Audubon 
Society members at 8 a.m. Admission is free, but parking costs $3. (On 
weekdays, parking is $2.) 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn is encouraging people to hunt up old photos and write down their 
memories of the Nature Center. The results will be bound into a "People's 
History Book" by Pia Pizzo, a Long Beach artist who specializes in tactile 
books. Children have made drawings for the book, while many adults have 
recorded favorite memories of watching foxes run and waterfowl at play. One 
longtime visitor wrote of finding "peace, tranquillity and time to read John 
Muir" on early 1970s visits to the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Nature Center designer Philip E. Peterson, a naturalist who will be honored at 
the birthday celebration, "looked for shrubs and trees that would produce 
berries and fruits for animals," Blackburn said. "They were looking for habitat 
more than for a plant community. There are very few cohesive plant communities" 
in the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The animals don't complain, though. The Nature Center (where no hunting or 
fishing is allowed) is home to red foxes, gray foxes, long-tailed weasels, 
pocket gophers, field mice, opossums, skunks, wild house cats, raccoons and 
snakes (but "no rattlers," Blackburn said). Numerous water turtles -- red-eared 
sliders, snapping and soft-shelled -- inhabit the lakes, along with bass, 
bluegill and mosquito fish. Many of the animals were imported to the Nature 
Center; others came on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Facility and resource manager M. W. (Bill) O'Connell, the park naturalist, 
estimates that more than 120 species of birds pass through the Nature Center 
each year, some of them "rarities and odds and ends." 
</P>
<P>
"We had people coming from as far as Northern California to see this one 
(blue-winged) warbler that was here last fall," Blackburn said. A local chapter 
of the Audubon Society meets regularly at the Nature Center. 
</P>
<P>
The museum contains a small, permanent natural-history display put together 
with the help of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Also in the 
museum is a small gallery that features changing exhibits of art and 
photography. From May 9 to July 8, the gallery will exhibit the museum's 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
The center's trails are open every day except Monday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
and the museum opens at 10 a.m. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, the center is 
open Mondays as well. The center is at 7550 E. Spring St., Long Beach.

LEGACY OF A VISIONARY; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORIC BANNING MANSION SETS GROUNDWORK FOR FLOWER SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost everyone who came to California during the mining boom caught "gold 
fever," but Phineas Banning did not. . . . He had visions of greater things. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oliver Vickery, "Harbor Heritage" 
</P>
<P>
A California historical treasure sits peacefully in a quiet residential 
neighborhood in Wilmington just south of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-room Greek Revival-style mansion is almost as much an incongruous 
surprise today as it must have been in 1864, when Phineas Banning hired ships' 
carpenters to build it amid marshes, muddy tide flats and one-story adobes. 
</P>
<P>
Banning, a visionary who launched the beginnings of what became Los Angeles 
harbor, built the house as a homage to his native Wilmington, Del., after 
amassing a sizable fortune as "the transportation king" of Southern California 
with a 
</P>
<P>
stagecoach company, wagon manufacturing and a shipping business. Banning also 
built the first railroad in Southern California and served in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The Banning Residence Museum, widely recognized as the finest 19th-Century 
Greek Revival house in Southern California, was occupied by three generations 
of the Banning family before the City of Los Angeles purchased the property in 
1927. 
</P>
<P>
The house, which sits in the middle of a 20-acre city park, remained dormant 
for many years, but a full-scale restoration began in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Today it has been returned to its original Victorian elegance. Furnishings and 
artifacts have been painstakingly selected to represent the styles popular 
during Banning's lifetime, including 42 pieces of furniture original to the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
This fine old house will look especially resplendent next Saturday and Sunday 
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., when the works of 17 professional florists are 
displayed there as part of Floriade II, a flower and horticulture show. The 
event is presented by Friends of Banning Park and is a benefit for the museum. 
Admission is $6 per person. Children 12 and younger are admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Themed Floral Design 
</P>
<P>
Each of the florists has decorated a room, using the house and its artifacts as 
a backdrop for a themed floral design. Meanwhile, a competitive 
flower-arranging display will be held in the basement orientation room, 
surrounded by huge photographs showing the development of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, landscape designers have created a colorscape in a sunken garden area 
near the main gate featuring flowers of the season. Nearby in the newly 
restored coach barn, a competitive horticulture show includes the best of 
Southern California plants and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the lectures, demonstrations, competitions and the innovative and 
creative displays produced by the region's top floral designers and 
landscapers, Floriade II brings together in one place all the elements 
necessary to create and maintain a beautiful garden," says Donna Gibbs, event 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Attractions 
</P>
<P>
The competitive shows are being coordinated by the Costa Verde District 
California Garden Clubs Inc. Members of the Long Beach, San Pedro and Hermosa 
garden clubs, the Gardeniers of Palos Verdes and the Riviera Garden Club of 
Torrance are participating. 
</P>
<P>
Two special lectures are an added attraction. Artist and author Fleur Cowles of 
London will present "The Life and Time of the Rose" at 11:30 a.m. next 
Saturday. Then at 2 p.m., James Goslee, a New York floral designer and author, 
will discuss "Living With Flowers," followed by Nancy Goslee Powers, former 
editor of House Beautiful, addressing "Intimate Gardens." The lectures are an 
additional $15 each. 
</P>
<P>
A boutique will feature garden furniture and accessories, gardening books, 
botanical prints, topiary trees, orchids, unusual plant containers, dried 
floral arrangements and Victorian-themed paper items and books. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New England Influence 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, who became involved with the museum about eight years ago, says: "I love 
this part of (the) history of Los Angeles because I'm a native and I think so 
many people have a concept of Los Angeles as all Hispanic heritage, and they've 
lost sight of the New England influence. It's really developed into the great 
city that it has because of people like Banning." 
</P>
<P>
"He (Banning) was a visionary man," Zoe Bergquist, museum director, agrees. "He 
had a vision that the area would make a magnificent harbor. There was quite a 
conflict between (Collis P.) Huntington, who wanted the harbor in Santa Monica, 
and Phineas Banning, who wanted the harbor here . . . but Phineas Banning won 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"He really opened up the passages which are today's freeways," Bergquist 
continues. "Banning, Calif., for instance, is named after him and that was one 
of the stagecoach stops. . . . He was an expert at driving what they called the 
six-in-hand (stagecoach)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overflowing With Guests 
</P>
<P>
In the book "Harbor Heritage," Oliver Vickery, a historian and curator emeritus 
of the Banning mansion, wrote: "The history of San Pedro and Wilmington, 
California, is the history of Phineas Banning. When Banning arrived on the 
scene in 1851, the state was just one year old, and California needed creative 
imagination, guidance and leadership." 
</P>
<P>
In Banning's day, this house usually was full of guests. He loved to entertain. 
The house was the site of patriotic festivities on Washington's birthday and 
the Fourth of July, in addition to many commercial and political meetings. In 
spite of his Eastern upbringing, Banning enjoyed California barbecuing, and 
frijoles were served from a pot so large that it was stirred with a shovel. 
</P>
<P>
Banning also was fond of addressing his friends from a second-story porch 
during such festivities, and was said to have had a voice "loud enough to be 
heard beyond the hills." 
</P>
<P>
During more formal dinner parties, the dining room was used. One of Banning's 
contemporaries wrote of him: "No man in our state has given so many banquets 
and balls, dinners and receptions as he." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treasures in Residence 
</P>
<P>
In memory of those days, treasures abound in the restored mansion. There's a 
delicately carved rosewood American Rococo Revival parlor suite by Joseph Meeks 
from mid-19th Century, Banning's American Eastlake roll-top desk of walnut and 
mahogany, massive mahogany bookcases full of collections of Charles Dickens and 
other 19th-Century writers, a wicker baby buggy with metal wheels, an ornate 
claw-footed tub in the bathroom (added in 1876) and Banning's own massive bed 
with a veneer of Cuban mahogany. These are just a few of the pieces that create 
a real feeling for what life must have been like in the Banning household. 
</P>
<P>
"Each room is done in a different decade," Bernice Klohr, chairman of the 
Banning Residence Museum Volunteers, says. "You'll never see a piece of 
furniture dated after the decade of the room. It's always before or for the 
time period." 
</P>
<P>
The dining room, for instance, is furnished with Phineas Banning's mahogany 
dinner table, which is surrounded by reproductions of Chippendale chairs. The 
table is set with crystal, Banning family silverware and English Imari 
ironstone ware in an Oriental design popular in the latter part of the 19th 
Century. An American Eastlake walnut sideboard (circa 1870), carved with fruit, 
fowl and wild game displays several pieces of silver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Home Economist' 
</P>
<P>
In the upstairs kitchen, a black Garland stove with ornate silver-colored trim 
sits across from a soapstone sink and a zinc-covered work table. The stove 
originally was wood-burning, but was converted to gas in the early 1880s. In 
Banning's day, the kitchen also featured the latest gadgets, such as apple 
peelers, bean slicers, cabbage graters and "the home economist," a black metal 
cabinet used to store flour, coffee, tea and other staples. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside the house is what once was the old milk house. It is now restored 
as a late-19th-Century schoolhouse. Slates, chalk and McGuffey's Readers are 
neatly arranged atop the desks, and a photo of Abraham Lincoln hangs on one 
wall. During school tours of the mansion, children are able to experience a day 
in the life of a child of the 1800s, including sack races. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Groups by Appointment 
</P>
<P>
The Banning "interpreters" are carefully prepared to provide accurate 
information during such tours. Training includes a four-month history course 
with speakers on such topics as decorative arts, architecture, textiles and 
history. Group tours are by appointment, but the house is open to the public 
for tours Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 12:30, 1:30 
and 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Just a short walk from the schoolhouse is the coach barn, which has been under 
restoration for several years. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends of Banning Park will use funds from Floriade II to further equip 
the barn, restore Banning family vehicles, produce a video on the development 
of transportation in Southern California, restore historic aspects of the 
gardens and continue to preserve this fascinating slice of early history.

SWISS PAIR FLY 970 MILES TO WIN BALLOON RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gordon Bennett Balloon Race trophy is headed for Switzerland. The Jura, a 
helium balloon piloted by Swiss flyer Karl Spenger and his son-in-law Roland 
Schuler, landed on an Indian reservation in Ashland, Mont., Monday afternoon 
for the winning distance of 970 miles. The annual race, which starts in Palm 
Springs, is won by the balloon that flies the farthest from the desert town. 
</P>
<P>
Though they could have flown longer, Spenger said, he decided to land the 
balloon because he and Schuler had planned to fly by way of Kansas -- and had 
maps for that course -- but the wind blew the Jura north. 
</P>
<P>
The Ben Abruzzo award, named in honor of the balloonmeister killed in a 
ballooning accident in 1985, went to the Rosie O'Grady, piloted by Joe 
Kittinger and Sherry Reed, who landed in Evanston, Wyo., Monday morning. The 
award is given to the balloonists (other than the winners) who stay airborne 
the longest.

THINGS ARE LOOKING ROSY FOR SHOW AT HUNTINGTON GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rules about the care and feeding of roses abound: 
</P>
<P>
Don't let spray from the hose wet the foliage (and, for heaven's sake, don't 
water with a sprinkler) -- you'll get mildew. Prune your bushes down to a few 
sticks each winter, otherwise, the roots won't be strong. Spray, spray, spray 
for bugs -- the aphids will be the death of your plants. When you do water, do 
it before noon -- no real reason, just do it. 
</P>
<P>
The list could go on and on. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem with these rules is that they aren't necessarily valid, 
especially considering the forgiving growing conditions found in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Botanical Gardens' biennial rose show, today and Sunday in San 
Marino, is a good place to see gorgeous roses that have been cared for in ways 
rather different from what old wives might recommend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Water 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, these roses -- many of which are decades old -- are watered. 
Really watered, using big, old-fashioned overhead sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is really important for roses," says Clair Martin, curator of roses for 
the Huntington. "They need it continuously; we just don't ever let them go 
dry." 
</P>
<P>
Martin suggests flooding your roses until you see runoff, then checking with a 
screwdriver to see how deeply the watering has soaked in. You want 5 to 6 
inches of soil to be wet; if the soil is dry a couple of inches down, water 
again thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
In the cool, gray weather typical of May and June, you'll probably only need to 
water once a week, but every other day might not be often enough when summer's 
heat hits full force. 
</P>
<P>
To help avoid mildew, water by midday if possible to give the rose bush's 
leaves a chance to dry before nightfall, Martin says, but there is one big 
exception to this rule: "If you get home from work at 8 p.m. and you notice 
that your roses are dry, water them. They're just like people -- they want a 
drink when they're thirsty. No matter what, don't let them stay dry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dealing With Mildew 
</P>
<P>
And if you are really worried about mildew, use a product such as Ortho's 
Funginex before you ever see any of the telltale furry patches on your shrub's 
leaves, Martin recommends. Once mildew gets a good toehold, it's tough to 
eradicate, but take heart. Its season typically ends by July 4, as June's fog 
rolls out for good. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about a little mildew," Martin says. "If it really bothers you, 
try to pick varieties that aren't as susceptible -- and keep your plants 
healthy by making sure they get enough water and fertilizer." 
</P>
<P>
Martin uses a slow-release fertilizer on the roses at the Huntington twice a 
year -- in March and mid-July -- primarily because the size of his garden makes 
it tough to fertilize more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need special food; just follow the directions on any good fertilizer 
and pick something with reasonably high nitrogen," he says. 
</P>
<P>
As with most flowering plants, dead-heading, or removing spent blossoms, is 
important for roses. 
</P>
<P>
"We prune as we dead-head to maintain the shape of our bushes," Martin says. 
"Cut back to the first or second full set of leaflets. The classic rule was to 
prune back to the first five-leaf set, but some bushes don't have sets of 
five." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pruning and Pesticides 
</P>
<P>
Martin says his crew doesn't allow rose hips -- the bulging seed pods that 
swell at the end of the stem after blooms fade -- to set, because they diffuse 
the bush's energy. But because the Huntington wants maximum color from its rose 
bushes, gardeners wait until the blossoms are completely falling apart before 
pruning. 
</P>
<P>
Martin is not a big fan of insecticides. He feels that aphids are a fact of 
life in Southern California; if possible, he gets rid of them by hosing the 
bushes off with a powerful stream of water. "We spray (with insecticide) only 
when we have to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He also advocates a less severe pruning than many gardeners are used to. 
</P>
<P>
"We prune in January or early February and take off less than half of the 
growth on some of our bushes," he says. He recommends leaving tea roses at 3 
feet or more -- substantially taller than the more familiar 6- to 8-inch canes. 
</P>
<P>
A thick layer of mulch under your roses helps keep them moist; Martin 
especially likes a fragrant undergrowth of thyme or a pretty carpet of violets. 
You also can chip the organic material from your garden and pile it on two or 
three inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Old' Roses Featured 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington's rose show will be open today and Sunday from 1 to 4:30 p.m. 
The non-judged show will feature a great number of roses from the Huntington's 
gardens, with an emphasis on pre-1950 "old" roses, which are rapidly regaining 
popularity. A plant sale from 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. both days will offer more than 
100 varieties of roses; many have been propagated from the Huntington's 
collection and are quite unusual. 
</P>
<P>
A video on the care of roses will be run throughout the two-day show, and 
volunteers will be available to help answer your questions about growing this 
beautiful plant. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the Huntington is free, although a $2 donation is suggested. If 
you're from Los Angeles County, you'll need reservations if you want to attend 
on Sunday; call this afternoon to make them. No reservations are required for 
attendance today. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington is at 1151 Oxford Road, San Marino. For Sunday reservations, 
call (818) 405-2141. (If anyone in your party is from outside L.A. County, you 
won't need reservations.)

O.C. FUGITIVE HELD IN SWEDEN AFTER SEA HOAX; 
</P>
<P>
MAN AND SON WERE REPORTED LOST IN OCEAN OFF CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The report of the supposed tragedy came on the evening of March 11 from Scott 
Steele's distraught Swedish girlfriend: Vacationing on Santa Catalina Island, 
the Dana Point businessman and his 3-year-old son, Schyler, had gone out on the 
water early that morning in an inflatable boat but hadn't returned. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of a drowning, several dozen U.S. Coast Guard searchers combed 
frantically through the night by air and sea for the missing father and son, 
but they emerged empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials now believe that the searchers were only wasting 
their time on a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Steele, they say, was already on his way with his son to Sweden to later meet 
up with his girlfriend, leaving behind an estranged wife in Tustin who had 
legal custody of the boy, and a string of criminal fraud charges in Orange and 
Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, Steele's international adventure appeared to have come to an end 
when Swedish authorities arrested him at the home of his girlfriend and placed 
his son in the temporary custody of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just such an incredible relief," said 27-year-old Marci Helsley 
Steele, the estranged wife and Schyler's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been so hard. Ever since this whole thing happened, my whole life has 
been on hold. Some days, it looks like they've found them; the next day they're 
gone; I feel like I'm on a roller-coaster," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I just can't wait to go over and get my son back," she said, adding that 
she has had legal custody of the child since the couple's separation in the 
fall of 1987. The father, who lived most recently in Riverside County, was 
limited to twice-monthly visits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marci Steele plans to go to Sweden this weekend to bring her son back to 
Tustin, and U.S. law enforcement officials who will accompany her said they 
also expect to pursue Scott Steele's extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
If Steele is extradited from Sweden, he faces charges of child abduction atop 
several sets of criminal charges that officials said are pending against him 
under various assumed names. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious of those is a 32-count warrant on charges of grand theft, 
perjury and forgery that was filed against Steele late last year. State 
Department of Motor Vehicle investigators allege that Steele, running a Dana 
Point "gray-market" auto firm that imported and registered European cars, 
forged tax forms to pocket more than $44,000 that should have gone to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Steele, who officials said has a prior conviction in Santa Barbara for 
credit-card theft, is also wanted in Riverside County on suspicion of passing 
bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
And Newport Beach police say that they are also still investigating Steele for 
allegedly having run a boiler-room scam that robbed local precious-metal 
investors of more than $100,000 in 1987. No charges have been filed in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy was a real operator, plain and simple," said Bruce Rouse, a senior 
investigator with the Riverside County district attorney's office who has 
followed the case closely since Steele's mysterious March 11 disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Gunnar Edlund, an officer with the Uppsala Police Department in Sweden who is 
handling the Steele case, said in a telephone interview that Steele was 
arrested without incident around 2:30 p.m. Friday, Swedish time, at the home of 
his girlfriend, Susanne Pettersson. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson, the woman who allegedly made the false report about the boat 
disappearance off Catalina, was a live-in nanny to Schyler while Marci and 
Scott Steele were still living together in both Temecula and Dana Point, Marci 
Steele said. She added she believes that her husband and Pettersson -- who is 
now more than 7 months pregnant -- were romantically linked even before the 
Steeles' separation. 
</P>
<P>
Edlund said "there had been a plea from the U.S. government to the Swedish 
government for his arrest, and those are the grounds we have been acting on." 
</P>
<P>
Edlund, who said he spoke with Steele at length in the Uppsala city jail, said: 
"He claims that he has come to Sweden with his son to get a fair chance to 
defend himself (against the pending U.S. charges). He says he can't get a fair 
trial in the United States, that his ex-wife is trying to make him look bad. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed determined to get custody of his son," the officer added. 
</P>
<P>
Marci Steele said that her estranged husband "is obsessed with Schyler. He 
would say that if he couldn't have him, no one could." But, she said, she 
believes that it was the threat of criminal prosecution that prompted Steele to 
flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
"He just hated the idea of going to jail," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials said they believe that Steele, along with Pettersson, 
planned his elaborate escape well in advance, going so far as to secure the 
passports of another Orange County man and his child. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a sophisticated scheme," said Investigator Rouse of Riverside. "They 
went to great lengths, involving a lot of people. He even planned to be out of 
the country in advance" of the report of his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
As scheduled, Steele picked up his son from Marci Steele and took him and 
Pettersson for a vacation trip to Catalina island the weekend of March 10, 
officials said. That Saturday evening, a frantic Pettersson called authorities 
to say that the father and his boy were apparently lost at sea, hours after 
they were to return to their rented condominium from the boating trip. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. John J. Jaskot of the Coast Guard in Long Beach, said Friday: "We 
took this very seriously as a legitimate distress call." The Coast Guard, 
undertaking what Jaskot described as a massive search, sent out five different 
helicopter teams, two jet aircraft, an 82-foot patrol boat and other search 
teams to try to find the Steeles. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the next day -- Sunday -- that the search was suspended after 
the Coast Guard's efforts were largely exhausted and police investigators came 
across information from friends and relatives to suggest that the boating 
accident might be a ruse. 
</P>
<P>
But by then it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
Investigator Rouse said he believes that on March 10 -- a day before his 
disappearance was even reported -- Steele took his son on a commercial ferry 
from Catalina to San Pedro, then caught a flight from Los Angeles International 
Airport under assumed names to West Germany and then on to Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
There, they met up later with Pettersson, who left the country March 16 before 
police could detain her, Rouse said. She is now wanted for aiding and abetting 
in a child abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Steele and Pettersson left behind a $550,000 house in Riverside County along 
with virtually all of their personal property, which they later instructed 
neighbors to try to sell, Rouse said, adding: "They just up and left with 
nothing but a few clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Rouse said that after the hoax was discovered, he stayed in close touch with 
U.S. State and Justice Department officials as well as Swedish authorities to 
try to track down the elusive Steele -- but with little success until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marci Steele said that she was "shocked and hysterical" upon first learning 7 
weeks ago about the report of her son's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
The report was particularly unnerving, she said, because "I sensed that 
something was wrong the whole week before they left. . . . I had just had a 
dream that Schyler was drowning." 
</P>
<P>
But she said she soon began to suspect that the supposed accident may have been 
prearranged. "I just knew sooner or later he was going to disappear with 
Schyler," Marci Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
But others conceded that they were less suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana attorney Kenneth D. Miller, who had been defending Steele against the 
pending charges in the "gray-market" cars case, said that until hearing the 
news of Steele's arrest from a reporter Friday, he had assumed his client was 
still missing off Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled a phone call soon after the disappearance from Pettersson. "She was 
hysterical, said they were lost at sea. And I had no reason to believe 
otherwise," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to hear he's still alive," the defense attorney said. "But if this 
guy in Sweden is truly him, he's obviously in a lot of trouble."

FAMILY BIDS FAREWELL TO VICTIM OF BATTLESHIP BLAST; 
</P>
<P>
IOWA SAILOR IS LAID TO REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a brass coatrack in a tiny room just off the sanctuary of the Costa Mesa 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hung the symbols of Geoffrey Scott 
Schelin's youth: a red Estancia High School baseball T-shirt, a worn catcher's 
mitt, an old pair of cleats covered with a layer of ocher dust. 
</P>
<P>
Arranged on a table nearby were the symbols of his emerging manhood: a 
photograph of Schelin in formation with other seaman during a Navy parade, a 
letter of commendation from a rear admiral, a magazine article describing life 
at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, just before Schelin's large, close-knit family filed into the 
church sanctuary for his funeral service, they gathered in silence for a few 
moments around the lovingly-built shrine. 
</P>
<P>
"You entered the Navy a boy, you grew to be a man, you died a hero," said 
26-year-old Craig Schelin later, as he delivered a tearful and moving eulogy 
for his youngest brother, the only sailor from Orange County to die in an April 
19 explosion aboard the battleship Iowa that killed 47. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the sailors were returned to the Iowa's home port of Norfolk, 
Va., on Monday, where a mass memorial service, attended by President Bush, was 
held. The sailors' caskets were then shipped to their hometowns for funerals 
and burial with full military honors. 
</P>
<P>
At Schelin's services Friday, the most often repeated theme was that he had 
come into his own in the Navy, and that in dying in service to his country, his 
short life had become a soaring triumph instead of a senseless tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"He performed his assignment well. He will be back at some other duty 
assignment after this," a Latter-day Saints official told the Schelin family, 
expressing his religion's belief that the earthly sojourn and the afterlife 
have purpose. 
</P>
<P>
After the graveside service at Pacific View Memorial 
</P>
<P>
Park in Newport Beach, at which a detail of Marines fired the traditional 
volleys over his grave, another of his older brothers assured reporters that 
the Schelins are angry with no one over the devastating blast in one of the 
Iowa's gun turrets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a freak accident," Daryl Schelin, 36, said. "You probably had the 
best turret crew in the world in there." 
</P>
<P>
He and 20 other members of the family were given a tour of the Iowa and its gun 
turrets Monday after it arrived in Norfolk. They were satisfied that every 
possible safety precaution had been taken on the vessel of World War II 
vintage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing they held back," he said. "There was no unstable ammunition 
on that ship." 
</P>
<P>
In the eulogy, Craig Schelin remembered his brother, the eighth of Darlene and 
Dale Schelin's nine children, as a confused youth without direction in 1986 
after he graduated from Costa Mesa's Estancia High School. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that confusion, Craig suggested, may have stemmed from Geoffrey's 
attempts to move out of the shadows of four older brothers. After he joined the 
Navy in 1987, and after a brief period of difficulty adjusting to boot camp, he 
began to develop discipline and a sense of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how much he grew in the last 2 1/2 years," Craig Schelin said. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Schelin, a petty officer 3rd class, had become so good at his job of 
supervising the loading of gunpowder on the Iowa's gun deck that turret 
captains were vying over which would get to keep him, the family said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Bruce Hoggan of the Mission Viejo Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, of which Darlene and Dale Schelin are members, said being on the Iowa 
was no accident in Geoffrey Schelin's life. 
</P>
<P>
Given the choice of being assigned to any one of four ships in January, Hoggan 
said, Schelin "immediately chose this great ship, for this was the best. He was 
proud to serve among those who served on his ship."

GROUP WANTS OPEN SPACE BONDS TIED TO TAX FOR ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of environmentalists is threatening to fight a proposed sales tax for 
traffic improvements unless the county sponsors a bond issue designed to give 
them perhaps $2 million or more to buy land and protect it from development. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they are seriously considering the deal, which is similar 
to a compromise struck last year in Contra Costa County. Some proponents of the 
half-cent levy, though, think the environmentalists lack the clout to force the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental community is saying that we've been left out of the process 
for so long that we need something on our side for us to support a sales tax," 
said Elizabeth Brown, who proposed the deal as president of Laguna Greenbelt 
Inc., an influential environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
"The roads that will be built with that (sales tax) money will only make it 
easier for new development to occur," Brown said. "Some of us are not 
interested in helping with any more transportation stuff without something on 
the other (open space preservation) side, and that's the message we're trying 
to get out . . . . There is no money to purchase the open space at the city and 
county level." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans for Referendum 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission, chief sponsor of the sales-tax 
proposal, is formulating plans for a Nov. 7 tax referendum intended to help 
raise $3.1 billion for a 20-year, $11.6-billion program of county traffic 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Brown believes her group has muscle enough to scuttle that measure. After all, 
she and other activists helped defeat a 1-cent transportation sales-tax measure 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been down this sales-tax road before, and we can end up with the same 
result," Brown said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The deal worked out last year in Contra Costa County, involving a $2.25-million 
open-space bond act, helped secure passage of that county's half-cent 
transportation sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Some tax proponents, however, doubt that Brown has the power she claims. They 
note that she and other environmentalists were the leaders for the under-funded 
and understaffed campaign for Measure A, the countywide slow-growth initiative 
that voters rejected (56% to 44%) last June. 
</P>
<P>
John Simon, a lawyer who led the developer-financed effort against Measure A -- 
and who said he likes the open-space idea -- said Brown does not have the 
troops or the money to be a serious political threat, except in a close 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, said, "We're listening with an open mind" to Brown's idea, which 
even she concedes is still in the "formative stages." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it depends on what specifics she (Brown) comes up with," Oftelie said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formal Proposal Hoped For 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the open-space issue will be discussed by a transportation committee 
next week in the hope that a formal proposal can be presented to the OCTC at 
its May 8 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
There could be at least one roadblock, however: Developers, including officials 
of the powerful Irvine Co., say they will support such a bond act only if its 
defeat does not bar collection of the proposed transportation sales tax should 
that measure pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that as long as it can go on the ballot and not be directly linked to 
the sales tax so that it (the environmental bond act) doesn't have to pass, we 
could support the idea," said Irvine Co. Vice President Hugh Fitzpatrick. "But 
there would have to be ground rules." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Fitzpatrick said, developers will probably want assurance 
that the open space bond act would be general and not specify which land would 
be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said she would use some of the money to buy Irvine Co. land in Laguna 
Canyon -- land that the firm has targeted for development. She said she would 
like the bond issue to raise a sum at least as high as the one 
environmentalists in Contra Costa County obtained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is a Quid Pro' Quo 
</P>
<P>
Norm Grossman, a member of both Laguna Greenbelt and the advisory panel that 
recently wrote the Board of Supervisors' new growth management regulations, 
said, "This is a quid pro (quo) -- the same as it was in Contra Costa -- based 
on a realization that growth management involves other things, such as 
preservation of natural resources, and that means open space." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman added that if a sales tax election is held in November, it is unlikely 
that an open-space bond act could be drafted in time to be placed on the ballot 
as a companion measure. Instead, he said, there would have to be some agreement 
with sales-tax sponsors that they would support the open-space bond act in the 
June, 1990, election. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Grossman have been active members of the Citizens Advisory Committee, 
a group appointed by county officials to review the Transportation Commission's 
20-year traffic improvement plan. The improvement plan is a document required 
by state law before the proposed half-cent sales tax can be placed on a 
countywide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Brown recently joined the executive committee of a new group led 
by Pacific Bell Vice President Reed Royalty called the Orange County Foundation 
for Consensus in Transportation. That group is researching transportation 
matters in anticipation of the sales tax election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opinions Solicited 
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to bring a lot of potentially divergent viewpoints around the 
table," said Todd Nicholson of the Industrial League of Orange County, a 
diversified group of business and civic leaders. "If there are large blocks of 
people out there who do not have some ownership in the plan (the county's 
traffic improvement program), then we're going to have some difficulty at the 
polls." 
</P>
<P>
Added Brown: "The only reason I'm involved in these (transportation) meetings 
is the open space issue. If it dies, then I don't see how I can campaign for 
the sales tax." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Simon is leading a group that has paid for a public opinion poll on the 
sales tax issue -- Simon declined last week to release the results -- and is 
paying $7,000 to Sacramento political consultant D.J. Smith as reimbursement 
for extra work done after Smith's consulting contract with the county 
Transportation Commission expired in February. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has advocated tying an open space measure to the proposed sales tax, 
was a consultant to the proponents of the tax measure approved in Contra Costa 
County.

THE BIG RACE: FUN, FROLIC -- AND SOME EVEN COME TO SAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On board their 30-foot sloop Friday morning, Brian Rorering and his wife, Karen 
Greengard, had packed most essentials for this, their maiden voyage in the 
Newport-Ensenada International Yacht Race. Not much room, of course, for 
anything but the basics: safety gear, foul-weather garments, Chips Ahoy 
cookies, cocoa, canned chocolate pudding and almost every brand of potato chip 
available. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, the couple and four friends joined America's Cup skipper Dennis Conner 
and about 4,000 other sailors as they glided out of Newport Harbor in a 
dazzling flock that filled the ocean horizon for miles. 
</P>
<P>
The 550-yacht spectacle drew hundreds of spectators to the sea, toting picnic 
baskets and binoculars, from the business-suited to families packed into RVs. 
By the time the armada of racers had vanished from sight, at least a few 
million dollars had been left in their wake -- at Newport Beach restaurants, 
markets, hotels, boatyards and hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they win, place or never cross the finish line at the Mexican port, 
participants in the 42nd annual race anticipated a salty, sassy time along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The Prospectors, a rowdy crew of San Francisco doctors, lawyers and business 
professionals who regularly enter the race, got started early Friday morning. 
With loudspeakers perched on the bow of their 47-foot yacht, the Prospectors 
listened to an Austrian three-piece combo playing at dockside. The sailors 
downed champagne in their now-standard crew uniforms: tuxedo shirts and tails 
with loud shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Although they have proven sailing skills -- one crew placed eighth in its class 
some years back -- the Prospectors put heavy emphasis on having a wildly good 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a seven-man crew, but there's about 150 people here to party," said 
skipper John Roveda, who has taken part in the race for 14 years. "We try to 
stay out of their way so they can race if they want to," he added with a smirk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picnic Food? Nope 
</P>
<P>
While more competition-minded sailors feed on barbecued chicken, fruit and 
juices, the Prospectors steer away from picnic food. 
</P>
<P>
Head chef Derek Knudsen, a San Francisco lawyer, described the crew's menu: 
Friday night dinner was to begin with a lovely 1987 Edna Valley Chardonnay -- 
three cases of it -- followed by Belgian endive salad topped by anchovy 
dressing, and a seafood pasta dish with prawns, scallops and lobster. An 
exquisite Pinot Noir would complement the big hurrah -- filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast today would be simple: eggs with lox and bagels plus Bloody Marys. 
Lunch was to be something called Hussong's gut bombs (French roll, sauerkraut, 
ham and cheese). And if they don't arrive in Mexico tonight, frozen pizzas have 
been stocked as backup. It seems unlikely they will run dry of booze. 
</P>
<P>
Since the race started in 1947, alcohol has been at the heart of the event, 
often dubbed the "tequila derby." The race has become as legendary for the 
drunken celebrations after the sail as it has for the journey itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Serious Side 
</P>
<P>
But officials of the Newport Ocean Sailing Assn., which organizes the race, 
would like that image to fade like a late-summer suntan. Pennants saying "Drug 
Abuse Is Life Abuse" were tucked into each boater's registration packet. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I think that image is hard to shake," said Lorin Weiss, the 
race's general chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The race is a logistical nightmare for organizers. Besides determining with 
video and computer equipment and cameras who finishes when, the 230 race 
officials must account for each of the 547 boats that were entered in the 
derby. There are strict rules and safety regulations that boaters must follow, 
and an important one includes informing race officials whether or not you 
finish the race. 
</P>
<P>
For a veteran like Don B. Ayres Jr., the rules, requirements and preparation 
are second nature. 
</P>
<P>
Owner of the Countryside Inn in Costa Mesa and patriarch to an Orange County 
racing family, Ayres has a 68-foot yacht, the Drumbeat, that is loaded with 
computers that tell the 12-man crew the boat's location, wind speed "and about 
25 different things," and spit out weather maps. The boat is roomy and 
impressive but spartan. There is no liquor on board. The restroom is covered 
only by a canvas door to lighten the load. 
</P>
<P>
"We did win the race with my dad several years ago," Ayres said, standing 
outside his waterfront home as his crew of sons and friends began arriving 
early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remember Everything? 
</P>
<P>
But for first-time racers, trying to remember all the gear and details can be 
daunting. 
</P>
<P>
Rorering and Greengard had to conquer "flag protocol" -- a detail that the 
Irvine computer sales manager had almost let escape him. Turns out that the 
couple had "the wrong type of American flag" for the race and "we needed to get 
a Mexican flag that you have to throw up on the starboard (side) when we get 
into international waters," Rorering said. Then you must tack on the boat's 
classification flag, the official race flag and the "Drug Abuse Is Life Abuse" 
pennant -- well, you get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
An hour before race time, there was the matter of Greengard's "humongous" 
duffle bag which, Rorering said, threatened to be a storage problem (curiously, 
it was the same size as his own). And yikes! There was no beer! 
</P>
<P>
Those emergencies averted with tongue planted in cheek, the merry crew of the 
Q.E.D. -- short for a latin term meaning yet to be proven -- unpacked brand new 
main and spinnaker sails and arrived on time at the starting line near the 
entrance of Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"My fear is not performing well in the race," Rorering said with a grin. "I'm 
worried about the little stupid things . . . like where to anchor? How do we 
get ashore? Where's the finish line?" 
</P>

DEADHEADS GRATEFUL FOR CAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Robbie Seals, a chilled can of beer in one hand, a cigarette in the other, was 
one of the lucky ones Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Utah electrician had a place to crash after Friday's Grateful Dead concert 
at Irvine Meadows. His campsite at O'Neill Regional Park in the county's 
eastern foothills had been reserved for several days. Now he was "slumming" in 
a beach chair, soaking up the sun and getting primed for the concert. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all set up," Seals said proudly as he surveyed his campsite: an orange, 
two-person tent, a well-stocked cooler and a bag of groceries. "Everything's 
falling into place." 
</P>
<P>
Byran McClintock's karma wasn't as good. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock and his van full of Deadheads pulled up to the main entrance at 
O'Neill park Friday after a 2-day drive from Salem, Ore., only to be told that 
the 1,700-acre county park was full. All 128 campsites were reserved through 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Bummer," McClintock moaned. "Where to now?" 
</P>
<P>
Ranger Richard Dyer advised the Grateful Dead loyalists to move on. McClintock 
slowly turned around the Volkswagen van -- with a red, white and blue peace 
sign painted on the side -- and drove off. He was not alone in his predicament. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of free-spirited followers of the 1960s rock band who converged on 
Orange County this week for the group's three weekend shows were caught short 
in their search for overnight accommodations. In past years, fans of the 
drug-era cult band were allowed to camp overnight in the Irvine Meadows parking 
lot. But not this year. Tired of complaints about noise, trash and consumption 
of liquor and drugs, Irvine city officials made it clear to concert promoters 
earlier this year that the annual Dead shows would not continue if fans were 
permitted to congregate on Irvine Meadows property during the weekend 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
The promoters complied and decided to steer fans of the band to more 
appropriate settings in the county's regional parks. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like an ideal fit. Stashing fun-loving rock fans in remote, isolated 
reaches of rural Orange County satisfied those worried about unruly 
disturbances in public. 
</P>
<P>
And for hard-core Deadheads, those who consider the band's appearances as more 
than a concert -- "It's a happening," one devotee explained -- camping in the 
parks was well-suited for socializing. 
</P>
<P>
"Got to be able to get to know thy neighbor in case you run short on milk, 
oranges or rolling papers," offered Bob Winston, a Northern California auto 
mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming to the Dead shows in Irvine for 4 years, and this is the best 
setup yet. It's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Winston said the word spread quickly among Deadheads about O'Neill park. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, the campground was booked for the weekend. Shortly before noon 
Friday, Caspers Park, another county overnight campground east of San Juan 
Capistrano, was also sold out through Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"About 90% of the people in here are Deadheads," said Richard Dyer, supervising 
park ranger at O'Neill. By today,he estimated, the number of people camping at 
the park may reach 500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parked Near Gate 
</P>
<P>
The only trouble thus far occurred Friday morning when Dyer showed up for work 
about 6:30 a.m. Two carloads of Grateful Dead fans, who had arrived at the park 
after closing Thursday night, were parked in an unrestricted area near the main 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
"We rousted them, and told them to move along." 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, Dyer said, four rangers will be on duty tonight and Sunday 
until midnight. In a departure with normal procedure, two more rangers will 
patrol the park until daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to make sure that when those folks start returning from the 
shows," Dyer said, "there's no trouble." 
</P>
<P>
At the amphitheater, police had arrested about a dozen people by the start of 
Friday night's concert, Irvine Police Lt. Vic Thies said. More than 40 officers 
-- nearly every available officer in the department -- was on duty as a 
precaution. A similar number of officers will be deployed for the band's two 
remaining shows, tonight and Sunday, Thies said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, trying to prevent a recurrence of revelry that occurred in the 
amphitheater's parking lot last year, closed the area to all but those with 
concert tickets. The result, police said, was that large groups of people went 
to other areas of the city to park and party -- most notably the industrial 
section on the opposite side of the San Diego Freeway. Some parked on the 
freeway itself, and CHP officers were dispatched to move them along. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police said they were continuously making arrests for offenses such as 
selling drugs and being drunk in public. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is the last thing Wendy and Tom Scotts want. The couple, in their early 
40s, traveled to Orange County from Boise, Ida., for a dose of Dead. Every 
spring, Wendy said, the couple "dances away winter" by attending one of the 
band's concerts. This is their third trek to Irvine to see the group, and first 
stay at O'Neill park. As much as the music, it's people that make it a "good 
trip," Wendy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Deadheads may seem like dropouts," she explained, "but in reality they care 
about things most people have lost interest in because of this fast-paced, 
commercial life style we live today. 
</P>
<P>
"Deadheads care about family, tradition and spiritual replenishment," she said. 
"Can you relate? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a party for sure, but it's good for the soul." 
</P>
<P>
Two campsites away, Cameron Joyce was in the midst of a snack of corn chips and 
enriched Kool-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I added a shot of Cuervo. Want a sip?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce had come with a Volkswagen full of friends from the California desert 
town of Borrego Springs. At 24, Joyce, a part-time carpenter, was just a baby 
during the band's Haight Ashbury heyday. Nonetheless, he describes himself as a 
"big-time fan" of the band and its following. 
</P>
<P>
"Where else can you go and find people who like to have a good time without 
damaging themselves or each other," he said. "It's cool. It's the best."

WHICH COLLEGE? SENIORS HAVE UNTIL MONDAY TO CHOOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You are 17 years old. You are about to make the biggest decision in your life 
so far. And you have only 48 more hours to make it. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about stress. 
</P>
<P>
For college-bound high school seniors, that pressure is not hypothetical. Most 
have until Monday, the traditional May 1 postmark, to decide which school they 
will attend next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's agony for them," explained Jack Wright, a college counselor at Franklin 
High School in the Highland Park section of Los Angeles. "It's a very heavy 
decision to them, almost like getting married. When the honeymoon is over, they 
still want to feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Many factors can influence the choice, Southern California area students said 
this week, including financial aid, campus location, parental pressure, 
curricula and social life. But, as with a marriage, it sometimes comes down to 
a certain indefinable emotion, an intuition. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Gloria Rodriguez of Huntington Park High School applied as a 
possible biology major to UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Stanford and Mills 
College; only Stanford rejected her. UCLA and UC Berkeley, she realized, are 
too big and busy for her. Some last-minute confusion over financial aid brought 
her in close telephone contact with UC Davis and Mills, a women's college in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Mills went out of their way to take care of my problems," said Rodriguez, a 
top student at the overwhelmingly Latino high school. "I got a lot of personal 
attention from them." With sizable scholarships from both schools, she chose 
Mills because she thinks she'll get similar treatment in the classrooms there. 
</P>
<P>
For two of her classmates, a university's setting is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Estrada, who wants to study engineering, was accepted at UCLA, UC 
Berkeley, UC Davis, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Davis and San Luis Obispo are 
"too isolated" and Berkeley too far away, he decided. So, Estrada, the 
second-youngest of 10 children and the first to attend college in his family, 
chose UCLA and plans to live on the Westwood campus. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA has a lot of stuff going on," said Estrada, who does not want to miss any 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ruth Garcia decided against UCLA in favor of UC Santa Cruz for the 
opposite reason. "I think I'll do better if I'm in the middle of the redwoods, 
away from all the pressures," said Garcia, a prospective engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Money, of course, is important now that a year at private institutions can cost 
$20,000. "For our kids, no financial aid, no go," said Carrye Baker, a 
counselor at George Washington Prep, a predominantly black school in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Vance Guidry of George Washington received substantial scholarships for UCLA, 
UC Berkeley and UC Davis, but he chose UCLA because of the good reputation of 
its economics department. He was also accepted at Morehouse College in Atlanta 
and Xavier University in New Orleans, both black institutions, before he 
realized he wanted to be part of a more diverse student body. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, his brother went to a trade school out of state and lost some 
hair from the stress of being far away from home. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go bald-headed," Guidry said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Yamada of Franklin High has a problem others might envy. His parents say 
they can afford to send him to Williams College in Massachusetts, which offered 
a loan, work-study aid and a small scholarship. But Yamada won an academic 
all-expenses-paid scholarship at Occidental College, practically walking 
distance from his home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List Will Be Studied 
</P>
<P>
"Either way, I might be giving up a good opportunity," explained Yamada, a 
probable biology major who also was accepted at Amherst College but rejected at 
Stanford and Harvard. "If I went to Williams, I guess my growth as a person 
would be accelerated compared to if I stayed around here." Yet he does not feel 
he has to leave Los Angeles, and he would not need a part-time job at 
Occidental. So, he is spending the weekend on a list of pros and cons. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jertberg, director of educational support services for the Placentia 
Unified School District, said that it is the larger state universities that are 
asking seniors to make a decision now. 
</P>
<P>
"With the new funding problems, they're trying to get an idea of what next 
year's funding will be, so that puts the pressure on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that about one-third of the college-bound seniors from Placentia high 
schools attend community colleges, which allow students to sign up well into 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
One consolation for the seniors is that the tables are suddenly turned. A year 
of taking tests, completing applications, undergoing interviews and waiting for 
letters is over. Instead of students' courting colleges, the colleges this time 
of year court potential students with invitations to parties, telephone calls 
from alumni and letters from professors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Support for Choice 
</P>
<P>
For Jaimi Carter at University High School in West Los Angeles, that means 
swimming against the tide. She was accepted at Reed College in Oregon, 
Macalester College in Minnesota, UCLA and Stanford. To many California 
students, Stanford is just a dream. But Carter decided that Stanford is too 
conservative, and that UCLA is too big. Of the other two, both small liberal 
arts schools, Macalester has more of the international courses she wants and 
"better fits my personality." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think I've done the wrong thing" by saying no to Stanford, she 
said. "But people who know me well agree with me." 
</P>
<P>
Campus social life influences many decisions, said Don Olson, a college 
counselor at University High. One student, he said, received fairly equal 
scholarship offers from Caltech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
the nation's premier technical schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid said the social life was considerably better in the Boston area than 
at Caltech. So he is going to MIT," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some students have little choice because they applied to many 
difficult schools or because their grades were not high enough. Meanwhile, the 
ones with good options, such as Andrea Carter of San Marino, struggle. 
</P>
<P>
She is trying to decide between Occidental and UC San Diego after having 
received acceptances from four other UC campuses, Pitzer College, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo and rejections from Stanford, Pomona College and UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a couple of nights I didn't sleep too well," she said.

REVIEW CLEARS YMCA COUPLE OF ANY VIOLATION OF ETHICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A review has concluded that the couple who worked as managers of the Santa Ana 
YMCA violated no ethical standards by accepting money from mentally disabled 
clients, YMCA officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee that reviewed allegations of impropriety has recommended the YMCA 
adopt several policies to avoid "future such occurrences," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
William Orrick, manager of the Santa Ana YMCA branch, and his wife, Irene, 
director of the YMCA hotel, will be allowed to resume duties immediately, said 
Allan Shaffer, president of the YMCA of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been suspended with pay from their jobs last Thursday pending 
the outcome of the review. 
</P>
<P>
The Orricks were out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Bill and Irene Orrick acted out of compassion toward their 
clients," Shaffer said. "However, we must avoid even a hint of (impropriety) 
regarding our private contributions which support our various youth and 
handicapped programs." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the Orricks centered on whether they acted improperly by 
accepting thousands of dollars in donations from four mentally disabled men 
referred to their care by county mental health authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the donations were raised by YMCA officials and county 
authorities several weeks ago when it was learned that Irene Orrick managed the 
financial affairs of one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
YMCA officials were also probing whether it was a conflict of interest for the 
Orricks to refer YMCA hotel clients to two Santa Ana rooming houses they own. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said the review committee interviewed the Orricks, residents of the 
Santa Ana rooming houses and representatives of the Mental Health Assn., a 
private group that runs a program for homeless mentally ill in the Santa Ana 
YMCA, and concluded the couple engaged in no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to many tenants at the rooming houses and they indicated they were 
very grateful for the opportunity to stay there and for the kindnesses extended 
by Mrs. Orrick," Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said donations given by hotel clients to the YMCA through the Orricks 
will be returned. 
</P>
<P>
One of the donations was a $5,000 disability check given by Walter Titch, whose 
financial affairs were managed by Irene Orrick. The other large donation was 
from George Cleveland Jr., who had given the YMCA about $9,000 over a 2-year 
period, Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Titch, a convicted burglar, is undergoing psychiatric evaluation at the 
California Institution for Men at Chino. Cleveland is in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said the two men were not interviewed by the committee because of their 
declining physical health. But the men have stated publicly that they willingly 
donated the money and were not coerced, Shaffer said.

RAGS CATCH FIRE, CAUSE $10,500 DAMAGE TO SANTA ANA BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 300 employees and visitors were evacuated from a Santa Ana office 
building Friday morning when oil-soaked rags caught fire, sending clouds of 
toxic smoke through air shafts in the building, Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started by spontaneous combustion at 10:36 a.m. in a storage area on 
the first floor of the four-story building at 801 W. Civic Center Drive, Santa 
Ana Deputy Fire Chief James Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused $10,000 in damage to the building and $500 to its contents, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any rag that has been soaked in oil and rolled into a tight ball and discarded 
will burn if it's not in a place where you limit the combustion air," 
Montgomery said. The rags should have been stored in a metal container with a 
tight-fitting metal lid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinklers contained the fire to the room in which it started, he said. 
Firefighters had extinguished the flames in a few minutes, he said. The 
occupants, however, had to wait an average of 45 minutes for the smoke and heat 
from the fire to dissipate before they could return to their offices, he said.

LIRIANO STOPS MCCASKILL'S NO-HIT BID THIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
BLUE JAYS' .220 HITTER BROKE UP NOLAN RYAN'S GEM IN THE NINTH INNING SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Nelson Liriano, every at-bat is in the past. It is history, and it can be of 
no help to him later. 
</P>
<P>
That is why he says he was not thinking of past at-bats when he stepped in to 
face Kirk McCaskill at Anaheim Stadium in the ninth inning Friday night, with 
McCaskill three outs from a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Liriano said, he was not thinking of last Sunday, when he stepped 
to the plate with one out in the ninth and Nolan Ryan on the mound, closing in 
on what would have been his sixth no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
That no-hitter never came, and neither did McCaskill's. 
</P>
<P>
Liriano, a .220 hitter with just more than a year of major league experience, 
sent McCaskill's first pitch of the inning into left-center field for a double, 
breaking up a no-hitter in the ninth inning for the second time in less than a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Against Ryan, he hit a one-out triple in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever was or wasn't in Liriano's mind, it was a bit more clear what was 
being thought in the Toronto dugout. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays were thinking very hard about one of Liriano's past at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely," said Jesse Barfield, who nearly broke up the no-hitter with a 
long fly ball to left field that was saved only by Dante Bichette's running 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
"McCaskill threw the ball very well. You have to give him a lot of credit. But 
we had our secret weapon. We had Nelson Liriano." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill had an inkling about Toronto's secret weapon too. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the eighth and ninth innings, I figured I'd see (Liriano)," McCaskill 
said. "Baseball is a very superstitious sport, so I thought I'd see him." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Liriano seemed rather emotionless about his rather remarkable 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
He was clear on one thing though. At the plate, he was thinking only of the 
at-bat at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think about two things at the same time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The old refrain. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday is in the past," he said. "Every game is past, is history. That is what 
makes me feel more comfortable. I only have to think about the present." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, with Toronto trailing the Angels, 9-0, the present was not much 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
A chance at victory, even a chance to score a run, seemed a long way off. But 
Toronto Manager Jimy Williams said he did not send Liriano to the plate for Tom 
Lawless to break up the no-hitter -- hard as that is to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Liriano says he stepped in just wanting to reach base. 
</P>
<P>
And he did, the easy way. 
</P>
<P>
Liriano, a fastball hitter, said the ball he hit was a sinker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready for the first pitch," he said. "He wasn't throwing too many balls. 
He hadn't walked a lot of guys." 
</P>
<P>
Liriano didn't celebrate on the field, and he didn't celebrate in the 
clubhouse. He sat down to a meal and a beer, showered, strolled over to answer 
questions -- many of them the same as he had answered Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a pinch-hitter," he said. "I don't think about breaking up the 
no-hitter, I think about getting on base. But I am happy it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel excited. I feel good about myself. I never think I would go break two 
no-hitters in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
And especially not two in a week. But now, as Liriano would say, that is in the 
past.

THREE PLAYERS AT LIBERTY CHRISTIAN PUTTING UP SOME PRETTY BIG NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball practice begins each day after Ray Clifton turns over the engine of 
the 13-year-old school van and drives his team from the blacktop plains of 
Liberty Christian High School to the green, tot-filled fields of Liberty 
Christian Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The players dress in a makeshift locker room next to a first-grade classroom. 
Then they go about creating a makeshift baseball diamond on a football field 
that is bordered by a jungle gym and swing set. (Practice stops at least once 
each day when a kid wanders into the line of fire). 
</P>
<P>
If the players need to work on hitting, they trek to the local batting cages, 
where each player must provide his own quarters for the machines. There's no 
room to hit at the elementary school; when the team tried it, too many balls 
flew over the fence and assaulted passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton took over the team five years ago -- the season after the school 
forfeited its last 14 games because no one wanted to play. He forbids his 
players to complain about the limited facilities the Huntington Beach school of 
92 students can provide. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want them to dwell on what they don't have," Clifton said. "I want 
them to think about what they have." 
</P>
<P>
And this season they have a lot. Liberty Christian is 15-2 and hitting .441 as 
a team, in large part because of three players. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan James plays shortstop, is hitting .620 and has stolen 86 consecutive 
bases, a state record. Pitcher Chris Buckels is 6-1, hitting .596 and has 
struck out 67 batters in 32 innings. Catcher John Van Dyke is hitting .533 and 
has had only three passed balls in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Exceptional numbers. The question is: Are the three exceptional players, or 
exceptional small school players? In a county that, year after year, produces 
some of the best high school baseball talent in the nation, big numbers at 
small schools tend not to impress. 
</P>
<P>
"You get the feeling that people think of us as putzy little players," Van Dyke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All three have a connection with the big time. James and Van Dyke are ballboys 
and clubhouse attendants for the Angels. Buckels' cousin, Gary, is a pitcher in 
the Angels' farm system. 
</P>
<P>
They know what the big time looks like, they'd just like the big time to give 
them a better look. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouts will give kids from small schools looks," said Jack Hodges, the Laguna 
Hills coach. "They just don't look quite as often." 
</P>
<P>
Clifton says he hasn't seen a scout or recruiter at a Liberty Christian game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I wish I went to a big high school so I could get a college to look 
at me," James said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a feeling all three share. At one time or another, each has considered 
going to a larger public school so he could be seen by more fans, scouts and 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
But would they match up? 
</P>
<P>
Clifton admits there would be a drop in the numbers. Of James he said: "If he 
played at Ocean View or Marina I don't think he'd be hitting over .600. He'd 
probably be at .550 . . . I know there are people who don't take us seriously. 
But don't judge this little school until you come and see us play. At least 
give us a look." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHRIS BUCKELS 
</P>
<P>
A junior, Buckels' dream is to attend USC, a school to which he feels tied 
because his great grandfather owned the construction company that built 
Heritage Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But Buckels knows one building, albeit a very nice building, does not make him 
a baseball prospect. "I'll probably have to go to them, because they're 
probably not going to make the trip to see me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He considered transferring to Fountain Valley, just blocks from his house, but 
he has stayed at Liberty Christian, where he's happy but unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-1, Buckels is averaging better than two strikeouts per inning, his 
greatest weapon is a variation on the knuckleball his cousin Gary taught him. 
</P>
<P>
"He calls it the Buckel-ball," Chris said. "You throw it with top spin and it 
dances and then just drops off the table." 
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke, who has caught his share of college pitchers in summer leagues, said 
Buckels' knuckleball is by far the best he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It breaks twice," Van Dyke said. "Some of the people at this level (small 
school) are really overmatched." 
</P>
<P>
Which can be a problem. Buckels admits his mind wanders when things are going 
ridiculously easy. But he realizes that if he is to have a chance at USC or a 
comparable school, his statistics must be in the fantastic range, and he must 
take advantage of every overmatched hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"My stats concern me," he said. "If you don't have really great statistics at 
this level, colleges and scouts will just pass right over your name." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BRYAN JAMES 
</P>
<P>
James is the first to admit that his incredible record of 86 consecutive stolen 
bases over four seasons is a product of his environment as well as his talent. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher, a tough position to play at any level, is usually bankrupt at the 
small school level. Therefore, most of the Southern Section's steal records are 
held by small school players. For example, nine of the 10 top marks for stolen 
bases in a season are held by schools with 200 or fewer students. 
</P>
<P>
Just a week ago, Southern California Christian stole 39 bases in a game against 
California School of the Deaf, and that wasn't a record. The record is 43 by 
Temple Christian (80 students) against Harbor Christian (35). 
</P>
<P>
Still, sheer volume tells you that James, admittedly not a world-class 
sprinter, does know a thing or two about reading a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I study pitchers; I read their hips," he said. "When it rotates, I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
It's also the product of James' style, which Clifton describes as "sweaty, 
grimy, dirty." 
</P>
<P>
But the worst James can do during practice are grass stains, since he can't 
practice stealing on the all-grass practice field. 
</P>
<P>
That's OK with Clifton who, when he was coaching in North Carolina, once had a 
player slide into second during practice and had the base come up and cut his 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to have about million stitches," Clifton said. "So we don't practice 
it, we talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Besides being able to steal bases, James is the team leader in slipping ice 
down Clifton's pants. 
</P>
<P>
"Bryan has a way of keeping everything cool," Clifton said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN VAN DYKE 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Van Dyke is a catcher may give him the best chance of the three 
at breaking into a big-time program. 
</P>
<P>
He threw out 25 of 30 baserunners last season and has thrown out 17 of 22 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He has the classic catching body, block-like. Though he has the lowest batting 
average of the three -- yeah, he's dying at .533 -- Clifton says Van Dyke is 
his team's most important player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the backbone," Clifton said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, his life has revolved around the game. He knows he 
has to work twice as hard because of where he's playing. 
</P>
<P>
He and James attended the Southwest Professional Baseball Camp in Tucson last 
summer. Van Dyke was chosen as one of the camp's top prospects. He has worked 
on everything from throwing to running -- "I'm so much faster," he said. "I 
used to run like I had a piano on my back." 
</P>
<P>
He played in two summer leagues last summer, one a collection of mostly college 
talent that traveled to play in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I could hang with the college guys," he said. "But then I found 
out that the better your competition is, the better you get." 
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke hit .340 during the Australian tour. 
</P>
<P>
So there they are. None of the three is desperate about the situation. They 
figure if they really have the stuff, eventually someone will see it. 
</P>
<P>
To give them hope, there's always the example of the St. Louis Cardinals' Todd 
Worrell, one of the National League's best relief pitchers, who graduated from 
Maranatha High (450 students) in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
But more than hope, they'd like the look. And for that, they know they must 
continue posting ridiculous numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think we'll have to hit .900 before we have someone even give us a 
look," Van Dyke said.

EVERYONE CONTRIBUTES TO FOOTHILL VICTORY

<P>
Few of its players are among Orange County's top batters, but Foothill High 
School's starting lineup ranks among the best hitting teams in the area with 10 
players batting .300 or better. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill displayed all of its offensive prowess on Friday with every player in 
the lineup getting at least one hit in a 10-2 victory over host Santa Ana in a 
Century League game. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill (14-7 overall, 8-3 in league play) had 17 hits and had at least one 
hit in every inning. Catcher Scott Barton, pitcher Kent Donnelly and left 
fielder Tom Hawkins had three hits each. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly (6-3) pitched a four-hitter and struck out seven. Santiago Lopez 
scored the only earned run off Donnelly with a home run in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Donnelly quieted a good hitting team, retiring the last 10 batters 
as Foothill rebounded from a 3-2 loss to Santa Ana on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had nine hits against them on Tuesday. The only problem was that we didn't 
get the hits when we needed them," said Jerry Sedoo, Foothill coach. "We don't 
hit for power, but we are capable of hitting." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights have had at least 10 hits in seven games this season and came 
within one hit of their season-high of 18 against Santa Ana Valley on April 18. 
Donnelly, a junior, hit two doubles and a single and drove in three runs to 
lead the attack Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be a dominating player next year," said Bill Ross, Santa Ana coach. 
"This was a game they had to win. The game that was critical to us was on 
Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana (13-8, 8-3) has struggled this season without its top pitcher, Bob 
Reimers, who has experienced arm trouble. Reimers threw for the first time in 
the late innings against Foothill, but he hardly looked like the pitcher who 
won nine games last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder where we could be if Reimers was healthy," Ross said. "After you get 
past Jesse Rosas, we don't have much pitching. I'm not taking anything away 
from Foothill, but we didn't have much going for us on the mound today." 
</P>
<P>
Starter Victor Rios (4-3) was chased in the fourth inning when Foothill scored 
four runs to take a 6-1 lead. Santa Ana committed two errors in the inning as 
Foothill sent nine batters to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill added three hits in the fifth and sixth innings, then four more in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 5, El Modena 4 -- El Modena pitcher Marcus Esposito hit a two-run homer 
to tie it, 4-4 in the seventh inning, but threw a wild pitch in the bottom of 
the inning, allowing Marty Little to score from third with the winning run for 
Canyon (8-13, 3-8).

OCEAN VIEW TURNS GRAFFITI INTO ART, MOVES INTO FIRST-PLACE TIE IN SUNSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS KAISER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a motivator, Ocean View baseball coach Steve Barrett displays ingenuity and 
resourcefulness. His job necessitates it. 
</P>
<P>
But for Friday's Sunset League game against Fountain Valley, Barrett called 
upon an unusual source. He drew from the markings of a graffiti artist that 
appeared overnight on the Seahawks' right-field fence and third base dugout. 
</P>
<P>
And the Seahawks responded by defeating the Barons, 13-2, to earn a share of 
first place in the Sunset League standings. That victory, along with a victory 
by Westminister Friday, created a three-way tie for first place: Ocean View, 
Fountain Valley and Westminister are all 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
That Friday's game was for a share of first was probably enough to challenge 
even non-title contenders. But Barrett milked the markings for all they were 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what everyone at school was talking about," Barrett said of the graffiti 
that proclaimed Fountain Valley the Sunset champs and made other derogatory 
statements about Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
"I just used it to fire the guys up. I think we brought that emotion out here 
today. They took it kind of personally." 
</P>
<P>
Whether as a response to the drawings or to a big-game challenge, the Seahawks 
outpouring of offense resulted in a 10-1 lead after three innings and helped 
extend the Seahawks modest winning streak to three games. In all they collected 
16 hits, fueling starting pitcher Randy Karliner's second victory over the 
Barons. 
</P>
<P>
Karliner, who improved his record to 7-1 and was credited with Ocean View's 
only other victory over the Barons this season, allowed six hits over six 
innings. Brent Wilken earned the save for Ocean View, which improved its season 
record to 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the graffiti) caught everyone by surprise," Karliner said. "We didn't 
think anyone would do that. But you can't point the finger at anyone. A bum 
could have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Coach Ron La Ruffa, who said he learned of the incident on the 
way over to Ocean View, indicated he didn't know if any of his players were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said he didn't know whom to credit or blame for the graffiti. But when 
asked what he will use for Tuesday's game with Westminister, he deadpanned, 
"I'm wondering that myself. We can't play much better." 
</P>
<P>
In the Empire League: 
</P>
<P>
Katella 3, Esperanza 2 (11 innings) -- Katella's Billy Fitzgerald scored the 
winning run from second base in the bottom of the 11th inning on a strikeout 
when the pitch got past visiting Esperanza catcher Keith McDonald at Boysen 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, believing batter Chris Marquez had fouled off the pitch, failed to 
chase the ball immediately, allowing Fitzgerald to score. 
</P>
<P>
Both umpires ruled Marquez had not made contact with the ball. Fitzgerald had 
reached base on an throwing error by shortstop Jason Bates, the only error in 
the game. Esperanza led, 2-0, going into sixth on single runs in the fourth and 
sixth, both coming on sacrifice flies. Katella (13-8, 7-4) tied it on a 
bases-loaded walk and a wild pitch. Sean Schmidt (2-0) pitched the final three 
innings for the victory. 
</P>

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jennifer Smith pitched a no-hitter to lead Capistrano Valley High School to a 
1-0 victory over San Clemente in a South Coast League softball game Friday at 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second no-hitter this season for Smith, who also has five 
one-hitters. She lost a perfect game on a fifth-inning error. Smith had six 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley scored in the seventh on three consecutive singles. With one 
out, Tobi Roquemore, Teresa Doesburg and Alyson Carpenter singled, scoring 
Roquemore with the winning run.

UC IRVINE SLAMS DOOR ON FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Whitworth pitched a six-hitter to lead UC Irvine to a 5-3 victory over Cal 
State Fullerton in a Big West Conference baseball game Friday at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth, a junior right-hander, allowed two runs in the second and one more 
in the fourth. But no Fullerton runner reached second base after the fourth. 
Whitworth retired the final 14 batters he faced. It was the team-leading fifth 
complete game for Whitworth (5-6). Irvine has scored 15 runs in his six losses. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton led, 3-0, after four innings, but Irvine rallied for two runs in the 
fifth and three more in the eighth to take the lead, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Ed Luna and Al Rodriguez singled to start the inning for Irvine. 
Chris Gallego singled to score Luna and tie it, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Colarusso then replaced Fullerton starter Danny DeVille. Osmar DeChavez 
sacrificed and both runners moved up. Mike Goodcase was intentionally walked to 
load the bases, and Freddie Combs was hit by a pitch to force in a run and give 
Irvine a 4-3 lead. Colarusso threw a wild pitch to bring home Irvine's final 
run. 
</P>
<P>
DeVille took the loss for Fullerton (27-20 overall and 7-6 in conference play). 
Luna had three hits and extended his hitting streak to eight games for Irvine 
(17-29-1, 3-10).

AMERICAN CONTINENTAL'S OFFICERS ARE NAMED IN SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bondholders of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's parent company have sued directors, 
officers, outside accountants and law firms associated with the company, 
alleging fraud and deceit in the apparent loss of more than $250 million in 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The class action claims that American Continental Corp. in Phoenix and others 
perpetrated a "massive" scheme that wiped out substantial amounts of savings of 
thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
More than 22,000 bondholders may have lost their investments in American 
Continental bonds after the company filed for bankruptcy on April 13. 
Regulators seized Lincoln the next day, alleging it was being operated in an 
"unsafe and unsound" manner. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders, who are parties in other lawsuits in Orange County and Phoenix, in 
general have complained that they were led to believe that their investments 
were safe. Many contend that they transferred funds from insured deposit 
accounts into the bonds under the mistaken impression that their new 
investments were also insured. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to persuade depositors to buy bonds "was aimed at people who were 
not sophisticated in understanding the risks of this investment," said Ronald 
Rus of Orange, one of the lawyers who filed the class-action suit in Orange 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In talking to 450 bondholders, Rus said, he and Burlingame lawyer Joseph W. 
Cotchett found that the vast majority were more than 60 years old and stood to 
lose from $25,000 to $40,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
With interest rates only slightly higher than rates on certificates of deposit 
-- 9.5% for 1-year bonds and 10.5% for 2-year bonds -- the offering was 
"designed to attract this kind of depositor," Rus said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would never fly with sophisticated investors," he said. Savvy investors 
would have demanded a higher interest and would have known the bonds were risky 
investments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit does not name American Continental or Lincoln because of the delays 
and hurdles the suit would encounter in Bankruptcy Court and in U.S. District 
Court in Phoenix, where a tangle of litigation has already tied up the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the suit goes after the company's chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., 
and other officers and directors. It also names the Big 8 accounting firms of 
Arthur Young &amp; Co., Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp; Co. 
for their auditing statements on American Continental and Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, meanwhile, several dozen lawyers attended hearings Friday in 
Bankruptcy Court and, later, in U.S. District Court in regard to various issues 
in the cases. One of those issues -- whether American Continental's attorneys 
should be disqualified because they once represented regulatory agencies -- was 
not decided by the federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy judge, however, issued a temporary order allowing American 
Continental to keep its attorneys but appointing new attorneys for 11 of 
Lincoln's subsidiaries, which also were put into bankruptcy.

John Withers, recently named to succeed John Erskine as executive director of 
the Building Industry Assn. of Orange County, is instead resigning from the 
trade association to join a developer. 
</P>
<P>
Withers, director of governmental affairs for 2 years, will head a new 
residential development unit at Hopkins Development Co. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The trade association is searching for a new executive director. Erskine, 
director for 7 years, is leaving May 15 to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
The BIA is the lobby for home builders and related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins, known primarily as a developer of retail properties, will build both 
houses and condominiums and will concentrate on filling in already developed 
areas rather than building new suburbs, Withers said. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations come during a lull in an ongoing battle between the county's 
powerful real estate industry and slow-growth advocates. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest issues likely to face the new executive director is drumming 
up public support for a half-cent sales tax increase to fund construction of 
new roads. That will probably go before the county's voters next year.

POWER, THE NEWPORT BEACH ARTS COMMISSION, CENSORSHIP AND THE FULL NAKEDNESS OF 
ADAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently have witnessed a most brazen and benighted abuse of official power 
in the censorship of artworks by the Newport Beach Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Williamson, an artist and resident of Orange County, was invited by the 
commission to exhibit more than a dozen of her works (along with those of two 
other artists) at the Newport Beach City Hall Gallery. She duly delivered her 
pieces (for) exhibit from April 5 through May 2. (Then,) on receiving an 
anonymous complaint and viewing a paper sticker placed over one of Ms. 
Williamson's paintings, the commission decided to remove several of her works 
from the main showroom. 
</P>
<P>
The painting under review is a figure of a naked Adam, and it reminds me of 
another naked Adam on public view -- on (the) Sistine (Chapel) ceiling, by 
Michelangelo. If Pope Julius II saw fit to have that Adam unchanged and 
unclothed, with genitalia open to view, it behooves the shaking and quaking 
Newport Beach Arts Commission to take a more enlightened aesthetic view and 
restore these works to the viewing public, and have an end to this regressive 
act of censorship.

hangs through May 2 as originally scheduled.

POWER, THE NEWPORT BEACH ARTS COMMISSION, CENSORSHIP AND THE FULL NAKEDNESS OF

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing with regard to the shabby and disrespectful treatment of Rosa 
Williamson's artwork at the Newport Beach City Hall Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
If people are offended by the subject matter of her paintings, the rational and 
adult solution is simply not to look at them. 
</P>
<P>
The arts commission, which invited Ms. Williamson to exhibit her work, has not 
come to her defense, has not decried the abominably childish and scurrilous 
behavior of the city employees in their willful and malicious defacing of Ms. 
Williamson's property. 
</P>
<P>
If, as Cathy Curtis wrote in her column of April 16, "shunning works as 
innocent as nudes for any reason, at any age, is the mark of a provincial 
mentality," then invasion of personal property is the mark of an uncivilized 
mentality. 
</P>

WRITES AND WRONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's quite obvious from William Waxman's eloquent letter ("Criticism Directed 
at Reviewer's Remarks," Calendar April 22) that he, like myself and untold 
other Orange County residents, has become an undeserved victim of the poison 
pen of the Dan Quayle of Orange County theater critics, The Times' Mark Chalon 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
How Smith ever achieved such a position of prominence is beyond me. Even more 
perplexing is why The Times persists in letting this sterling example of the 
Peter Principle lay waste to the local theater scene. I'd dearly love to know 
exactly what credentials of Smith's convinced the powers-that-be to hire him. 
One gets the feeling he was drafted right off some community college campus. 
</P>
<P>
He obviously aspires to one day fill the shoes of Frank Rich or Dan Sullivan or 
John Simon. Charles Manson has a better chance of becoming President. 
</P>
<P>
I urge other concerned theater folk who are wronged by the ambitious Smith to 
fight back with letters, like Waxman's. If The Times won't pull the plug on 
Smith, maybe it'll at least transfer him to a department for which he's much 
better suited. Writing obituaries.

CHEF RELAXES AT HOME ON THE RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a little like Mario Andretti coming home from the Indy 500 and relaxing by 
taking the neighbors out for a spin in his Testarossa. Or Wayne Gretzky 
treating the gang to an evening of skating. 
</P>
<P>
You would think that after a full week of running the kitchen at Gustaf Anders 
restaurant, the last thing that head chef Ulf Strandberg would want to do is 
whip up meticulous gourmet meals at home. Most people would forgive him if he 
spent the weekend curled up with a basket of Chicken McNuggets and a frozen 
pizza and took the phone off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he often spends his off hours ringing up a few pals and having them in 
for the kind of meal that usually appears as the lead story in slick food 
magazines, the sort of feed that a lot of people couldn't knock together even 
if they knew how. 
</P>
<P>
Strandberg said that he has been cooking for friends at home "three or four 
times a week" since he and his partner, William Magnuson, opened the original 
Gustaf Anders restaurant in La Jolla in 1981. The two men moved the restaurant 
to South Coast Village in Santa Ana about a month ago. (The restaurant takes 
its name from both Magnuson's and Strandberg's middle names, Gustaf and Anders, 
respectively.) 
</P>
<P>
"Dinner is my favorite meal to do (at home)," said Strandberg, who received his 
restaurant training in his native Sweden. "But since we've opened in Orange 
County, I just haven't had the time. Now it's so much easier for our friends to 
come over for lunch, so I've been doing a lot more of that lately." 
</P>
<P>
One of Strandberg's latest lunchtime extravaganzas was held last Sunday at the 
Laguna Beach hillside home he shares with Magnuson. The two partners, assisted 
by Gustaf Anders bartender Tom King, entertained five friends at the house 
overlooking the ocean on a glorious afternoon that allowed Strandberg to serve 
part of the meal at a precisely laid table in the back garden of the house. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, came an array of Swedish appetizers in the bright, airy living 
room. The counter separating the tiny kitchen from the living room was 
dominated by three bottles of iced liquors: citron-flavored vodka and two 
brands of aquavit. Aquavit (literally, water of life) is actually a generic 
term in Sweden, said Strandberg, referring to "any flavored or unflavored 
distilled spirit, although most people think of the caraway taste as being 
typical aquavit." It was served ice cold in tiny, delicate glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"The aquavit table is always the beginning of a smorgasbord," Strandberg said. 
"It was a tradition that got started in Sweden about 150 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the counter were two different types of bread: limpa (a 
dense brown bread) and knack (a type of brown cracker bread). Both were baked 
in Gustaf Anders' bakery in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"When you break it," Magnuson said of the knack, "it goes knack." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere was a plate of matje, a type of herring topped with a sauce of creme 
fraiche, mustard and chives, as well as a small pot of pickled herring 
marinating in a juice of sugar and vinegar with onions, shallots and dill. 
Nearby were two small trays of smoked ham, served with a cod roe mousse made 
with onions and sour cream, and a large wedge of Swedish table cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The second course, sugar-and-salt-cured salmon -- called rimmadlax -- with 
sweet creamed potatoes with dill, was served with beer or Swedish mineral water 
in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's one of the best taste sensations," said Strandberg. "The salty 
taste of the salmon with the creamy taste of the potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, it was necessary for Strandberg to leave his guests for a time 
and concentrate on the business at hand in the kitchen: the main course of veal 
kidneys sauteed in cognac with cream, mushrooms and onions (accompanied by 
white rice and fresh-cooked asparagus spears). 
</P>
<P>
All of this culinary wizardry was accomplished in a kitchen that, Strandberg 
said, is far from ideal. It is what might be called a one-man kitchen, where 
turning around is about the only movement that can be performed comfortably. 
Also, the stove is electric and tends to heat up the entire surface of the 
appliance, a fact that does not please Strandberg. 
</P>
<P>
The house, he said, offers a wonderful view and fine space for entertaining but 
is merely a rented stop-gap for him and Magnuson until they can find someplace 
more permanent -- and with a larger and more accommodating kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not in the kitchen at home at all for myself," Strandberg said. 
"But for guests, it's very enjoyable. You can't do everything you want to do in 
a big restaurant kitchen when you're overseeing things. And we enjoy people. 
Rather than going out for a meal, it seems that there are always people here." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, he doesn't mind leaving the good times with his guests in order 
to whip up the main part of the meal. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no, I don't mind at all doing this," he said, smiling and pouring a 
little more cognac on the sauteeing onions. "It's fun. After all, when I'm a 
guest, I just sit back and enjoy myself and don't do a thing." 
</P>

JOSEPH N. BELL: EVEN IF IT'S OLD AND TRACT-Y, A MAN'S HOUSE IS HIS CASTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I open the cold water tap in our bathroom, I get a trickle of water. A 
diminishing trickle. I've been watching this happen for a couple of years, 
pretending there was nothing seriously wrong, but I can't do that any more. The 
water pressure in our bathroom wouldn't break a piece of tissue paper. 
</P>
<P>
I know what this means. We live in a 35-year-old house, part of a tract in 
which the houses sold originally for less than $10,000. The pipes that carry 
our water are old, of questionable quality and probably irrevocably clogged. We 
need to be re-plumbed. Everywhere. And I need that like I need another hike in 
my variable rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
We also have a small electrical problem. If I punch in a fan or a heater at the 
same time our auxiliary refrigerator is running in the garage, I blow out the 
system. We need to upgrade our electricity supply. And then there are the 
louvered windows in the bedroom that don't work and the hardwood floors that 
need refinishing and the single bathroom that can't begin to accommodate three 
people at rush hour -- let alone house guests. And, of course, the mortgage 
rate that is tied to some mysterious index I can never find but that I suspect 
is related to the price of Algerian oil. 
</P>
<P>
This sort of aggravation is making high blood pressure a frequent topic of 
conversation in our social circle. I know these problems are not uncommon, 
especially among owners of older homes. But that doesn't make me feel any 
better. The only thing that makes me feel better is to give serious thought to 
the ultimate solution: selling our house and either renting or buying a 
condominium. When I look at that option straight on, I start casing the Yellow 
Pages for plumbers. And electricians. 
</P>
<P>
Why? I've asked myself that many times. My wife and I both work, but I work at 
home and much of the burden of household problems falls on me. I'm at a stage 
in my life where I've already been through several houses, and whatever it is I 
was going to learn, I've learned. So why set myself up for all these problems 
when other options are available? 
</P>
<P>
For many of the same reasons that people continue looking for homes in Orange 
County, in spite of inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, there's space -- and its bosom buddy, privacy. We live in a 
relatively small house, yet there is always the illusion -- if not the reality 
-- of space. My wife and my 11-year-old stepson and I all have places where we 
can retreat. We use them, and they are an important part of the fabric of our 
lives. Now before you tell me that there are plenty of condos larger than our 
house that would offer the same privacy, let me stress that space is mental as 
well as physical -- and outdoor as well as indoor. A house, any house, feels 
spacious; and a condo, at least to me, feels constricted. That's partly 
subjective and partly because of a sizable yard we can see through every 
window. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's our neighborhood. I've written about it before, about the spirit 
that infuses it and the important part it plays in all our lives. I know that 
kind of neighborhood doesn't come automatically with owning a house, but the 
chances are a lot better. There's a kind of sterility about condo living 
(whether real or imagined doesn't matter) that seems to prevail against the 
clubby atmosphere of a warm and giving neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
These are tangible benefits, things I can reach out and touch, things I can sit 
in, work in, play in. But probably even more important to me are the 
intangibles. 
</P>
<P>
I was raised to believe in houses. Because of my father's work, my parents 
moved every year or two when I was growing up, and we learned together that 
apartments didn't do it for us. And so, despite the difficulties, we lived in a 
succession of houses, each one of which left a mark on me. I learned the 
wonderfully proprietary and substantial feeling of owning a house, a rock to 
anchor my life. The fact that a bank somewhere owns more of the house than I do 
is irrelevant. The bank doesn't sit in my yard or read in my home office or 
putter in my garage. I do. 
</P>
<P>
Which suggests one final enormous advantage of a house, especially an old one: 
It's a wonderful laboratory for puttering. I'm a lousy handyman, but I see 
myself as quite good, and a house is expansive enough that I can saw and hammer 
and drill all over the place without doing any appreciable harm. And if I get 
in over my head the neighbors will always bail me out. 
</P>
<P>
So I suppose I'll be calling a plumber one of these days about my water 
pressure. But not yet. If you open that tap as far as it goes, and add just a 
touch of hot water, it's still functional. Sort of. I'll give it another 6 
months, at least.

CONTAINER GARDEN IS FUN, PORTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KNIGHT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may not be the South Forty, or even God's Little Acre, but a container 
garden can produce surprising yields. 
</P>
<P>
Patio gardening has two big advantages over the in-the-ground variety: You can 
do it just about anywhere, which is important in an age of condos and shrinking 
yard space, and the pots are portable. You can move the plants around, inside 
and out, or even lend them to friends as party decor. 
</P>
<P>
At Sherman Library and Gardens in Corona del Mar, hundreds of potted flaura and 
hanging baskets adorn the grounds, providing variety and color. It is an 
excellent place to go to get ideas about what might work on your patio, porch 
or deck. The grounds also have an elaborate herbal garden in pots, ranging from 
parsley to thyme to garlic. 
</P>
<P>
Before starting your container garden, it is wise to ask yourself this 
important question, says Wade Roberts, garden director at Sherman Gardens: How 
much time do you want to spend on it? 
</P>
<P>
A simple collection of hardy shrubs, plants and flowers can require very little 
maintenance. Even a few container-appropriate edibles such as cherry tomatoes, 
chard or strawberries won't be terribly time-consuming. But "if you get really 
fancy, you're going to devote all your free time to this," he warns. 
</P>
<P>
So what does a basic patio garden consist of? 
</P>
<P>
For a dose of greenery, you can bring in some long planters full of shrubs and 
hedges, with potted palms, some ivy and dwarf trees. This will not give you a 
whole lot of color, but it is not a whole lot of trouble, either. You can even 
rig up a drip irrigation system, use time-release fertilizer, and "you don't 
have to do anything except come home and have a cocktail," Roberts says with a 
laugh. "It really isn't that hard to set up." 
</P>
<P>
To add some reliable color, the patio gardener can plant royal blue 
brunfelsias, which bloom heavily in the spring to midsummer with purple 
flowers; ivy geraniums, Indian hawthornes, azaleas, fuchsias, begonias and 
impatiens. These are all perfect for the semi-arid Orange County climate. 
Different colored shrubs such as the shiny xylosma, which has light green 
leaves for contrast, can also provide ornamental variety, as can the hibiscus, 
which has colorful flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Good drainage is essential for container gardening. Ordinary soil is too dense 
for drainage and root development, so use a commercial potting mix or mix soil 
with sand or other mineral elements such as Sponge Rock, redwood or orchid 
bark. 
</P>
<P>
Near the coast, you may have to water only once or twice a week. With an inland 
location like Brea, four times a week may not be too much. Micro-climates are 
also very important. If the pots are in direct sunlight, more watering is 
needed; in partial shade, less. Plants that get a heavy dose of afternoon sun 
are more likely to dry out than those that get morning sun. For the hotter 
areas of the county, such as the canyons, marigolds, zenias, petunias and 
bluefloss flowers do very well, says Susan Brozowski, color specialist at 
Sherman Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
To soften the climate, the patio can be equipped with trellises, shade cloth or 
laths, which allow some light but filter out the harshest sunshine. Shade 
plants such as Australian tree ferns or ficus trees can form a canopy for 
light-sensitive plants such as other varieties of fern. 
</P>
<P>
To tell how often a plant needs water, "look at the soil, feel it, touch it. If 
it is moist, it has enough," Brozowski says. Overwatering can lead to fungus 
rot, so "if anything, underwatering is best." Also, irrigation is preferable to 
overhead watering, because wet leaves and flowers can develop all kinds of 
diseases, such as powdery mildew. Never water blooming flowers directly, 
Roberts says. 
</P>
<P>
Mature plants have well-developed root systems that form into a ball, which can 
get quite dense -- and thirsty. "Solid roots drink a lot more, so you may have 
to fill a pot five times before the plant has drunk its fill," Roberts says. 
Usually, you should water until it starts coming out the drainage hole in the 
bottom of the pot, but this is not always an indication that the plant has 
sufficient water; if the root ball has become too dry and shrunk, the water may 
be draining down the sides. If so, the whole pot can be immersed until the root 
ball has loosened up. 
</P>
<P>
Since the container plants cannot draw nutrients from the ground, frequent, 
light fertilizing is recommended. Regular garden variety brands can be applied 
every 2 weeks or so to replace the nutrients that have drained away. Plants 
need more nutrients during times of growth and bloom, but less or none when 
they are in their dormant stage during colder periods. Days are shorter during 
the winter and less light means less photosynthesis and less new growth. You 
can even kill plants by trying to force growth with fertilizers or by pruning 
during the winter, Roberts says. But now is a good time to prune and fertilize 
for maximum growth. 
</P>
<P>
When a plant outgrows its container, the gardener has two options: shifting it 
to another pot or "shouldering it" -- i.e., pruning the root ball. There 
actually are plants that are introverts, such as the cather lily, that thrive 
when their roots are tightly compacted. They do not take well to being moved to 
larger quarters. A good rule of thumb is to replant to a pot large enough to 
leave an inch or two of fresh soil around the root mass. 
</P>
<P>
Containers can range from redwood baskets to clay, ceramic and plastic pots, 
and moss-lined wire baskets. Redwood is pleasing to the eye but has a short 
life span. "It looks good for about 1 1/2 to 2 years," Roberts says. 
</P>
<P>
"And after 3 or 4 years it starts to fall apart," Brozowski adds. 
</P>
<P>
Sawed-off olivewood or oak whiskey barrels make fine homes for trees, dwarf and 
otherwise. The root ball can be shouldered with a machete to get it to fit and 
then trimmed periodically. With proper shouldering, a ficus tree can thrive in 
a whiskey barrel, which can last 5 or 6 years. "You can even buy casters and 
roll it around the patio," Roberts suggests. The metal bands can be painted 
with rust-inhibiting paint, and the wood can also be painted for longer life. 
</P>
<P>
Clay and ceramic pots have almost unlimited life spans, and can be sealed on 
the inside with a tar mixture to hold the moisture. A pottery seal glaze can be 
applied on the outside to give it a shine and discourage discoloring from salt 
buildup, which gives pots a musty, white film that is virtually irremovable. 
</P>
<P>
All pots should have a drain hole in the bottom, which is kept from getting 
plugged by placement of rocks and pebbles in the bottom around the hole. You 
can get by without drainage if you have a charcoal and gravel bedding and you 
water sparingly, Roberts says, adding that it can be quite difficult to 
maintain a balance. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how good a start your container garden gets, the key to its 
well-being is maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"If you keep grooming, it looks 300% better," Roberts says. He cites the ivy 
geranium as a plant that should be pinched periodically to force new growth. 
"Many people just let them go, but even when you buy it new, give it a pinch." 
Pinching means breaking off the tips and branches down to the leaf nodes to 
make it branch out. 
</P>
<P>
As for pests, container gardeners in Orange County will most likely encounter 
spider mites, white flies, mealy bugs, aphids, and slugs and snails. All can be 
controlled with pesticides, but Roberts stresses that "anybody should realize 
that healthy plants will resist insects better than unhealthy plants."

POTTED CACTI JUST CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A cactus can't get too much sun, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people associate cactus and succulents with full, hot, blazing sun," said 
Richard Hipp, owner of House of Cactus in Stanton. But when home gardeners 
leave their potted cacti and succulents out in the summer sun, Hipp said, the 
results are often scarred and unhealthy plants. 
</P>
<P>
In the wild or planted in gardens, roots of such plants are kept at a 
relatively cool and uniform temperature, even when the plant above is baking in 
the hot sun; in pots, though, the roots are not so well insulated and can 
easily overheat. 
</P>
<P>
"The plants do burn," Hipp said. "Our California sun is just a little brutal 
for potted plants." 
</P>
<P>
Hipp recommends giving potted succulents and cactus full morning sun, then 
moving them to filtered sun in the afternoon. "The plants will be a lot 
healthier and prettier," Hipp said. 
</P>
<P>
Potted roses need more water -- The combination of pots and warm weather can 
also prove troublesome for roses. Many people don't realize that potted roses 
require more water than those planted in the ground, especially when the 
weather grows warmer. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time there's a heat wave, I get a bunch of calls about leaves dropping 
and spider mites," reported Mike Morton, co-owner of Country Bloomers Nursery 
in Orange. Potted soil loses water quickly, leading to stressed plants that are 
more prone to those afflictions as well as mildew and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll read that roses shouldn't be overwatered," Morton said about 
gardeners, but that does not apply as strongly to potted roses. 
</P>
<P>
Morton recommends watering every day when the mercury climbs above 75 or 80 
degrees and also that home gardeners consider a drip watering system with 
battery-operated timer. Because runoff water carries nutrients from the soil, 
potted roses also need to be fertilized more often than those planted in the 
ground.

Proper pruning is essential -- As a horticultural consultant for Roger's 
Gardens in Corona del Mar, Cristin Fusano has seen it all, from underwatering 
to overfertilizing, from misuse of spray pesticides and fungicides to "putting 
shade plants in the sun and sun plants in the shade." 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief problems she sees on visits to home gardens is poor pruning, 
especially pruning at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
Often, plants are allowed to become "leggy" and overgrown only to be cut back 
suddenly to the bare branches -- just as the cold weather hits. "The poor plant 
is forced to work overtime to put out new green leaves," Fusano said. 
</P>
<P>
Many plants need to be pruned regularly, but there is a right time -- and a 
right way -- to do it, she said. The timing varies from plant to plant, but in 
general spring is a good time. The best bet is to do a little reading before 
heading out with the shears.

Let there be (the right kind of) light -- The proper care of house plants is 
practically a science in itself, but many indoor gardeners doom their efforts 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"People buy the wrong plants for the wrong light," said Eddie Smith, co-owner 
with his wife, Debra, of the Plant Stand in Costa Mesa, interior plant 
specialists. Many plants require abundant natural light to thrive, he said, 
while others can get by on fluorescent lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Palms, for instance, need natural light, while the hardier dracaenas (including 
the popular corn silk plant) can survive under indoor lighting and infrequent 
watering. 
</P>
<P>
Where a plant will go -- and what the lighting conditions will be -- should be 
considered before buying an indoor plant, Smith said. He recommends getting 
professional advice on buying the right plant for the right conditions.

The bark of the dogwood -- The staff of Tree of Life Nursery in San Juan 
Capistrano, specialists in California native plants, came back with a 
less-than-serious response when asked to make a suggestion for this column: 
"Many gardeners create confusion in the garden by planting the dogwood too 
close to the cattails," reads the written reply. "This, however, is not as 
great a problem as it seems, because the dogwood's bark is worse than its 
bite."
