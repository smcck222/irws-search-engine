What a magnificent production of "Jesus of Nazareth." Hats off to Zeffirelli 
(et al.) who had the vision for such a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
It was my fifth viewing of the miniseries, which I would never miss. We seldom 
see such quality in films these days and what a treat to have NBC bring it to 
us.

Heartfelt gratitude fo NBC for its presentation of Franco Zeffirelli's 
magnificent "Jesus of Nazareth." This miniseries offered my family a treasured 
view of the real meaning of Easter, a tapestry of eternal love triumphant over 
death. The thoughtful exclusion of commercials during the conclusion was 
especially appreciated.

CBS is to be congratulated for its good soap operas, with the exception of one: 
"The Bold and the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
This soap plays like a comedy, even though I'm sure it's not supposed to. If 
the writers ax Ridge and Caroline, it would be a better show.

<P>
Grow up, Forresters . . . and get real!

MINISERIES TAKES A 'VOYAGE' ABOARD THE ACHILLE LAURO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All in the name of realism. That's why 10% -- $1 million -- of the budget of 
"Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair" was spent to rent the real Achille 
Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
For those with short memories: The Achille Lauro was the Italian cruise ship 
hijacked five years ago in the Mediterranean by four Palestinian terrorists who 
murdered Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American. 
</P>
<P>
"Voyage of Terror" stars Burt Lancaster and Eva Marie Saint as Klinghoffer and 
his wife, Marilyn. The two-part movie airs Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m. on 
KTLA. This first presentation of the syndicated Tribune Premiere Network is a 
German, Italian and French co-production that will air in Europe later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Re-creating the events for the $10-million miniseries proved to be not only 
costly but difficult and even dangerous for the producers, crew and cast. 
Troubles started with acquiring use of the actual Achille Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
"When the ship was owned by the (Italian) government, there was going to be no 
cost," said George Paris, vice president of Tribune Entertainment. "But then 
the government sold the ship, and it became a commercial venture. The new owner 
obviously couldn't give up the ship and interrupt its travel itinerary." 
</P>
<P>
The original captain served as the technical adviser, and several of the same 
crew members worked for the film's voyage and appear as themselves. For one 
week, the production took to sea on the same route as the ill-fated journey 
with 300 extras to film the violent sequences and terrorist activities. For the 
following 2 1/2 weeks, the crew and staff shared the ship with real tourists. 
</P>
<P>
David Lawrence, the American producer, remembered the original crew members 
were distraught when it came time to re-enact the hijacking. "There were tears 
rolling down their cheeks," he said. "We were re-creating things they had lived 
through." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very eerie," said Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Before production began on "Voyage of Terror," Lawrence talked with a good 
friend who was involved with "The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro," NBC's 
version of the event that had been shot in Australia and aired in February, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"He was amazed we had gotten the Achille Lauro and had gotten the complete 
cooperation of the Italian government," he said. "They had been warned to keep 
away from this project, because it was a life-threatening situation." 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many political aspects to consider," said Italian producer 
Fabrizio Castellani. "For instance, the American partner cared about the 
emotional aspects of the event and the Italian partner looked to the political 
aspects. It was a very delicate subject." 
</P>
<P>
The production also received a "fair amount" of pressure from governmental 
agencies of several countries because they thought "Voyage of Terror" showed 
the terrorists in a favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
"I heartily disagree with that," said Lawrence. "We are not saying the 
terrorists were good guys. We try to express their viewpoint. It's very 
difficult when you are juggling international situations." 
</P>
<P>
"Great care was taken not to paint a picture of the terrorists as four 
irresponsible terrorists who were out just to terrorize, but four young people 
-- these were all kids in their teens and early 20s -- who felt they were on a 
mission to help their countrymen," said Paris. "There was great care taken in 
trying to paint an accurate picture of the events, feelings and attitudes of 
the people involved. Those four kids looked at themselves not as terrorists, 
but as patriots."

PRIVATE LIVES: A WEARING EXPERIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
CLOTHES MAY MAKE THE MAN, BUT TO A WOMAN THEY'RE A MOOD-ELEVATING DRUG 
</P>

THE MIRACLE has happened again. I was sad, the sun wasn't shining, the computer 
was making funny noises. Fortunately, I knew exactly what to do. And now, 
sitting in my closet, carefully wrapped in tissue paper, emanating healing 
radiance, is a pristine white cardigan. And I'm cheerful and optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Saved! By the miracle of new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
I'm lucky. I can afford to ease my pains with a shot in the wardrobe. And I'm 
female. I know what joy a silk camisole or a paisley scarf can bring. Men don't 
seem to get the same kick out of clothing acquisitions. Not once have I heard 
my husband say, "Honey, look at the great socks I found today." 
</P>
<P>
"Men don't use clothes as a mood-altering drug," Duke says. "We go for cars and 
boats." 
</P>
<P>
Clothes take up less space. Besides, the only thing you can control in life is 
your wardrobe. Cars break down when you least expect it. Boats eat money and 
gas. Your house, your mate, your friends, your family, even your career, are 
beyond your control. However, you're in total command of what you put on your 
back each morning. 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes what I have to wear takes over," argues my sister, Laurie. "Like 
if I have a business meeting, I have to put on the power suit. I can't wear the 
funky dress with the fringe." 
</P>
<P>
That's only because that dress is olive and Laurie lives in Manhattan, where 
the women are in official mourning. "Everyone wears black all the time," she 
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, I went to New York on business. At the time, the only black 
thing I owned was my car. I stood in the baggage claim area at Kennedy airport, 
wearing a teal-blue coat and red pumps, surrounded by women in funeral garb who 
stared at me as if I were Bozo the Clown. It was a little disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
"Put this on," Laurie said tactfully the next day when I appeared in a tropical 
print. She reached into her closet, rummaged through racks of black skirts, 
black blouses, black sweaters, black shoes and even black sneakers -- and 
handed me a black jacket. It made me look and feel surprisingly sophisticated. 
"You should get one," my sister said. 
</P>
<P>
I was bound to succumb. The beauty of new clothes is that you can magically 
change your image with the wave of a charge card. Besides, fashion is a 
universal female bonding experience. My friends and I used to dress Barbie. Now 
we dress ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Male bonding is about sports," Duke says. "When a man visits another man, the 
last thing in the world they would do is try on each other's clothes. Or shop. 
I can't imagine saying to another man, 'Hey, that sweater would look really 
great on you.' " 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't know what he's missing. My sister took me to Nicole Miller, a sleek 
boutique on Madison Avenue. The ultra-chic, ultra-thin saleswoman in widow's 
weeds was aghast when I pounced on a red miniskirt. "No, no, it comes in 
black," she cried. But red always makes me happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you found that," my sister marveled. "I've been shopping here 
for three years and never noticed any color." Laurie did get me to buy slinky 
black slacks and an elegant black coat dress with jet buttons. But I returned 
the favor. I talked her into a purple suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I need a new look," Duke said when I modeled my purchases. 
Unfortunately, he was joking. As far as he's concerned, the old shoe is the 
best shoe. 
</P>
<P>
For years, I've been trying to purge his closet of a pair of virulent green 
velvet pants -- the color of an old wine bottle or Astroturf, depending on the 
light. Recently, I took them to the cleaners. "What do you want me to do?" the 
cleaner asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Lose them," I replied. (Alas, they're still here.) 
</P>
<P>
For the record, I'm not one of those slaves to fashion who refuse to wear the 
same outfit twice. And I'm not a compulsive buyer. I just like to wear pretty 
things. I wander through boutiques the way I wander through gardens, checking 
out the flowers in bloom. But I can say no. 
</P>
<P>
"Try this little dress," my friend Wendy said recently, holding up a dainty 
floral frock. We were in Suji, the cozy shop in Santa Monica, where she works. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need the little dress," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only $48," Wendy said. "It would look cute with lace leggings." True, but 
when I tried it on, I didn't get the feeling that something wonderful could 
happen at any moment. And what's the point of new clothes if you don't get that 
feeling? 
</P>
<P>
"Duke would really love it," Wendy said. I couldn't argue with that, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, at that moment, a dejected-looking woman trudged into the shop. 
Her face lit up when she saw the little dress. "Oh, what a beautiful dress," 
she said wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
Saved! By the miracle of new clothes.

NEW ANGLES ON A DESERT HIDEAWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA THORNBURG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rising like a Flintstone cartoon house from giant quartz monzonite boulders, 
this desert retreat on a 10-acre site in Joshua Tree was built with wit, style 
and the intention of breaking -- or breaking out of -- traditional rules. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, the house is three structures instead of one. Windows and door 
frames are angled, not plumb. Exterior walls are painted periwinkle blue, 
"gluggy" olive (the architect's adjective) and burnt orange, an otherworldly 
palette that is inspired by desert blooms such as yellow cups, lupine and 
poppies. "Combined in unusual combinations, earth colors are quite amazing," 
says architectural designer Josh Schweitzer, who built the residence as a 
weekend retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Building materials are basic: painted stucco, dry wall, exposed aggregate and 
simple cabinets. Likewise, the purpose of the house is simple. Schweitzer, 36, 
calls it a shelter, not a home, because 90% of his time there is spent outside. 
"It's really a refuge to give us shelter when we want to be protected, a 
service center for us to cook, bathe and sleep. People don't perceive it as a 
house -- it's not exactly your standard ranch with a roof," he says. The three 
structures occupy 950 square feet. The blue building houses the kitchen, dining 
room, bath, bedroom and two suspended sleeping lofts. It is joined to the green 
building, which functions as the living room, with a voluminous 20-foot 
ceiling. The open-air, poppy-colored structure stands apart from the others. 
It's used mainly for taking in the sunsets over the Little San Bernardino 
Range. 
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer, best known for avant-garde restaurant designs (he designed City 
Restaurant, Rondo, Border Grill, and recently Border Grill 2), 
self-deprecatingly describes his work as "chunky, clunky and heavy-looking." 
There is a certain monumentality in all of Schweitzer's work. His initial 
attraction to monumentality came in the sixth grade when a teacher introduced 
him to the wonders of ancient Egyptian history. Now he designs his buildings, 
and their rooms, with unusual heights, and they have, he says, a certain 
spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-square-foot living room has a ceiling as high as the room is long, 
giving the room an uplifting cathedral-like quality. "If I was to make a 
connection of how I perceived volumes and space, I would say, 'They don't have 
to be big, but they have to be tall,' " Schweitzer says. 
</P>
<P>
And what about those windows and doors? Spaces between the nearby desert rocks 
inspired Schweitzer to design the nearly trapezoidal shapes. Doors loom high 
and irregular. "We're so geared in our thinking that spaces must have a 
uniformity of heights," he says. "My whole bent is to disturb that sense of 
reality. They're not meant to be upsetting, just not the same."

NEW MACHINES AND THE LATEST MEDICINES CAN HELP AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT GO STEADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL S. WILKES MD and MIRIAM SHUCHMAN MD, Michael S. Wilkes is a 
physician and Clinical Scholar at the UCLA Medical Center. Miriam Shuchman 
teaches psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School. Their column appears monthly.

<TEXT>
<P>
JUST EIGHT WEEKS ago, Hank Gathers, one of the nation's top college athletes, 
collapsed on the basketball court. Two hours later, he was dead. He had been 
taking medicine to treat his heart condition -- a cardiologist had prescribed a 
drug after Gathers fainted during a game in December -- but it couldn't prevent 
the irregular heart rhythm that led to his death. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, 350,000 Americans die from sudden cardiac death, defined as death 
within one hour in a person who was otherwise medically stable. Many of these 
deaths result from a sudden irregular heartbeat caused by cardiovascular 
disease: hardening of the arteries. When one or more of the arteries that 
supplies the heart becomes blocked, an abnormal heart rhythm can result. This 
abnormality can prevent the heart from pumping properly, so blood may not be 
delivered to the brain and other vital organs. In the most severe instance, a 
person may lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Not all abnormal heartbeats are dangerous. A healthy person with a normal heart 
may experience an occasional extra beat, for example. But if an abnormal rhythm 
persists or if it causes symptoms such as fainting or chest pain, a potentially 
lethal condition that must be treated is present. 
</P>
<P>
After Gathers' fainting episode, he underwent several cardiac tests that 
indicated, during exercise, that his heart occasionally switched into a 
dangerous irregular rhythm. Doctors generally attempt to treat irregular heart 
rhythms, or arrythmias, in one of two ways: with medication or with electronic 
devices such as pacemakers. The medicines, known as antiarrythmics, are aimed 
at stopping or slowing irregular heartbeats. If standard medicines do not work 
for patients, doctors will turn to other, more powerful drugs, such as the new 
and highly potent antiarrythmic, amiodarone. Gathers was placed on propranalol, 
one of the most commonly used drugs for abnormal rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the medicines is 100% effective, and all can produce unpleasant 
side effects. Propranalol, for instance, can cause patients to feel tired and 
weak and can sometimes lead to depression. Amiodarone's side effects make it as 
difficult to take as certain forms of cancer chemotherapy. It can cause 
neurological problems, nausea and vomiting as well as lung and liver damage. 
Thus, amiodarone is rarely the first drug tried but is held in reserve for 
patients not helped by more conventional drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Juanito Balaoing, a 51-year-old Los Angeles building 
inspector and father of two teen-agers, suffered an unexplained cardiac arrest. 
He survived, and after he underwent many tests and prolonged hospitalization, 
his doctors still had no clear explanation why his heart suddenly had begun 
beating in a haphazard manner. 
</P>
<P>
Because Balaoing's heart had already stopped once, his was at high risk for 
another sudden cardiac arrest. Studies have shown that for patients who survive 
a sudden stoppage of the heart, the likelihood of their suffering another 
episode can be as high as 40% within the first year. So, the choice of which 
medicine to prescribe was crucial. Although all heart medicines have been 
proven effective for some facet of heart disease, they do not work predictably 
for all patients. Rather than prescribe a drug that might work for Balaoing, 
doctors felt obliged to determine exactly which medication would work best for 
him through a complicated and risky procedure called an electrophysiologic 
study. 
</P>
<P>
During such a study, the patient first is given a heart medicine designed to 
prevent abnormal rhythm, then is hooked up to sophisticated heart monitors. The 
doctor stimulates the heart muscle electrically, trying to induce the 
life-threatening rhythm. If the drug works, the stimulation should fail to 
produce a rhythm abnormality. In that case, the patient is sent home with a 
prescription for the tested medicine. But if the drug being tested fails, the 
abnormal rhythm that has been induced could be fatal, so doctors must be 
prepared to stop the dangerous rhythm by shocking the heart. 
</P>
<P>
In Balaoing's case, the electrophysiologic study did not clearly indicate that 
any of the medicines would be effective. At that point, his doctors considered 
implanting an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or AICD. This 
battery-operated device, about the size of a Sony Walkman, is a miniature-scale 
model of the large defibrillators used in emergency rooms. It monitors heart 
rhythm through three wires attached to the heart muscle. And it functions as a 
fail-safe system to restart a suddenly stopped heart, automatically providing a 
high-voltage shock that should return the heart to a normal rhythm. Implanting 
the AICD requires major surgery. It also is expensive, although the $50,000 
cost is covered by most insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
Balaoing was more than willing to have the device implanted. "I didn't want a 
metal box sitting in my belly," Balaoing remembers, "but I realized that if I 
didn't have the device and I was anywhere outside of an intensive-care unit, I 
could have a cardiac arrest and die." 
</P>
<P>
The device was inserted underneath the skin of his abdomen. "I constantly look 
like I am four months pregnant," he says. "I had to buy all new clothes, and I 
still am quite self-conscious about the way I look." Balaoing is lucky; his 
device has yet to discharge. But he lives in fear that it will go off while he 
is driving or in a public place. Upon discharge, a person experiences a sudden 
pounding in the chest as the device delivers a powerful electric shock to the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frightening when it goes off -- like someone just threw a football 
at you," says one woman who has an AICD. "But it's even more frightening to 
realize that if it hadn't gone off, you'd be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have shown that the AICD can dramatically reduce the risk of 
sudden cardiac death for selected patients with hard-to-treat irregular heart 
rhythms. Patients with the device have a one-year mortality rate of about 2%, 
while patients treated solely with medications selected by electrophysiologic 
studies have a mortality rate of 10% to 40% after one year. Overall, doctors 
are optimistic about the AICD, viewing it as a highly effective treatment that 
has provided thousands of people with additional years of life. 
</P>
<P>
For a patient to be considered for the device, there must be a reasonable 
suspicion that a lethal heart rhythm will recur, a belief that other treatments 
will not work and a willingness on the patient's part to have the operation for 
implantation. And the machines are not without complications. Some patients 
experience lung or heart problems soon after surgery. The device may discharge 
for no apparent reason, and on rare occasions it may fail. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are developing a new generation of devices that are more 
sophisticated and potentially useful for other types of heart problems. New 
heart medicines that may improve survival rates are being tested. But so far, 
there is no treatment that can remove all the worries.

STAGE WEEK: SHIRLEY MACLAINE'S STAGE INCARNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, you out there. Shirley MacLaine wants to talk with you. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm finding I want to break the proscenium more and more," said the 
Oscar-winning actress, whose new song-and-dance show, "Out There Tonight," 
opens at the Pantages Tuesday. "Maybe it's a natural evolution of advanced 
years: feeling the need to communicate, never knowing what I'm going to say, 
learning to work spontaneously, getting past the fear, the expectation of 
disaster. There's a lot of freedom in that." 
</P>
<P>
And film? 
</P>
<P>
"Film is a much cooler medium," said MacLaine, who's currently at work on a new 
book -- of course about her ("Can you see me writing about anybody else?"). 
"You know you can take it from the top or fix it in the editing room. On stage, 
the audience feeds you. It comes in waves of sound -- and waves of silence. 
When they're really rapt, you can feel the silence. It's immediacy, it's in the 
moment. Every time I go out there, I feel the barriers evaporating a little 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Yet when it comes to analyzing her Pied Piper appeal -- whether as a performer 
or proponent of New Age beliefs -- MacLaine believes her unabashed public life 
has created a certain intimacy with audiences. "My life is a literal open 
book," she said wryly. "So why shouldn't it be on stage or in a seminar? I 
can't hide. And I don't know that sharing is even a choice; I think it's a 
necessity in life." 
</P>
<P>
In this show -- patterned after her successful outing at the Wilshire Theatre 
in '84 -- the informal sharing coexists with a very physical workout: a 
collection of songs (some original, some from her films: "Can-Can," "Sweet 
Charity" and "Irma La Douce") and a "great big" dance tribute to 
choreographers. "It's not easy getting this together," she noted. "I have to 
get back in shape, get the right exercises, the right moves. I don't know 
what's going to happen when I get really old and can't lift my leg." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: Buddy, can you spare a penny? The Mark Taper Forum and Doolittle 
Theatre are rolling in change lately, thanks to two ticket discount programs: 
the month-old Public Rush (whereby patrons showing up 10 minutes before curtain 
may pay $10 -- cash -- for remaining seats) and its less structured 
counterpart, the ongoing "Pay What You Can" plan. 
</P>
<P>
Typical "Pay What You Can" contributions are said to hover around the $7 mark 
(or the price of a movie), although box-office employees report that fur-clad 
ladies have been known to proffer small change. And not long ago, one 
well-heeled couple sprang for a penny . . . for two seats. 
</P>
<P>
TASTY TIDBIT: Actress Maylou Sullivan makes an encore appearance's at Venice's 
Sculpture Gardens restaurant tonight with a reading of three "mini-stories" by 
Irishman Bernard MacLaverty, followed by a dinner choice of duck breast, 
shrimps and nopales or eggplant casserole -- plus appetizer, sorbet, dessert 
and coffee. For reservations: (213) 396-5809. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Pierre Corneille's 17th-Century romance-comedy, "The 
Illusion," gets a face lift in Tony Kushner's new adaptation at Los Angeles 
Theatre Center. David Schweizer directs. 
</P>
<P>
Cheered The Times' Sylvie Drake: "This 'Illusion' is a fascinating hybrid of 
fantasy and humor, with the magic remembering that it has feet of clay. It's 
not 'The Wizard of Oz' exactly, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Said Daryl H. Miller in the Daily News: "The show is fresh and invigorating, 
due to the timelessness of Corneille's dramatic vision and the timeliness of 
Kushner's adaptation. Schweizer's staging also adds zest, as do the inventive 
performances." 
</P>
<P>
Daily Variety's Kathleen O'Steen found it "lives up to a good deal of the 
play's comical potential while also substantially investigating the darker 
realms, thanks in good part to Schweizer's vision. Add to that Douglas D. 
Smith's wondrous settings." 
</P>
<P>
From the Orange County Register's Thomas O'Connor "Schweizer's engaging staging 
plays magic tricks with our perceptions and with Corneille's cautionary comedy 
about love's illusion. Yet it never toys or cloys . . . Almost everything 
suggests a surprisingly happy marriage of classic French style to hip '90s 
sensibilities."

This is everything you ever wanted to know about Cherry, who emerged last year 
as a promising soul singer and rapper -- plus a whole lot you didn't want to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
While a welcome change from simple clip compilations that offer no extras, this 
65-minute video verges on information overload -- trivial information. Do you 
really want to see her being made up for photo sessions or exchanging inanities 
with adoring fans during radio station chats? The behind-the scenes footage, 
while occassionally amusing, is self-serving. Surprisingly, the performance 
segments, featuring songs like her hit "Buffalo Stance" and "Inner City Mama," 
aren't the main focus. That may have been a wise decision, because Cherry seems 
to have limited talent. DENNIS HUNT

*** BILLY IDOL "CHARMED LIFE" CHRYSALIS: STAR SCALE: ONE (POOR) TO FIVE (A 
CLASSIC).

<TEXT>
<P>
And with a rebel moan. . . . No, Billy Idol hasn't gone in for whimpering 
confessionals. But the personal healing chronicled in much of "Charmed Life" is 
a long way from the exaggerated bluster that made the singer famous. 
</P>
<P>
Credit Idol's maturity, but also backhandedly credit his longtime guitarist and 
sidekick Steve Stevens, who had the good grace to go off to pursue a solo 
career and let Idol be. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years Idol seemed to be trying to top Stevens' guitar histrionics with 
his own increasingly buffoonish vocals. But the more restrained guitar of Mark 
Younger-Smith leaves Idol a free man, able to pull off such relatively subtle 
and affecting material as "Prodigal Blues" (a gently moving examination of his 
relationship with his parents) and "Trouble With the Sweet Stuff" (a caution 
against all sorts of addictions). 
</P>
<P>
But lest you miss the cartoon Idol, there's an embarrassing version of the 
Doors' "L.A. Woman." Idol yelps and growls and hollers while the band manages 
to avoid all the drama of the original -- which was hardly the Doors' best 
moment anyway. Skip this, but savor the rest. STEVE HOCHMAN

These days pop-rock sound tracks are usually unsatisfying packages featuring 
one or two likable songs and the rest filler. 
</P>
<P>
But this one, from the hit romantic comedy, is loaded with gems, from David 
Bowie's updated "Fame 90" and Natalie Cole's "Wild Women Do" to Red Hot Chili 
Pepper's "Show Me Your Soul." But there are two sappy clunkers -- by Jane 
Wiedlin and Peter Cetera. The gem of this collection, of course, is Roy 
Orbison's classic rendition of the title song. DENNIS HUNT

Few other women in rap have a firmer grip on the in-your-face concept of 
machisma than this spicy three-female unit. 
</P>
<P>
They seldom deal in heavyweight social matters but when it comes to voicing a 
swaggering sense of selfhood, Salt-N-Pepa delivers. "Negro Wit' An Ego" has 
strong comedic energy. "Expression," written/produced by Cheryl (Salt) James 
with a power-to-the-individual emphasis, is one of the wittiest rap tracks to 
emerge this year. CONNIE JOHNSON

Thank you, Calendar, for adding one more reason to my list of why I haven't 
been able to get my own television show. I already knew it's because I'm a 
straight, talented WASP who is not a stand-up comic, not an ex-professional 
athlete, not the son of a celebrity. Now I know it's because I'm also not a 
disc jockey.

Concerning the April 22 letters castigating the reviews of restaurants in

CD PACKAGING AND THE ENVIRONMENT: A MODEST PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the April 15 Pop Eye column on compact-disc packaging as an 
environmental danger and to subsequent letters: 
</P>
<P>
The record companies should throw out the oversize cardboard container, retain 
the jewel box with its (small) inside art and include coupons that customers 
can send in if they wish to obtain posters or record-album-size artwork or 
lyric sheets by mail. 
</P>
<P>
In the stores, have the CDs in jewel boxes on a shelf or, if security is a 
concern, behind the counter. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the customer showroom, display 12-inch-by-12-inch facsimiles of the CD 
cover art. (The larger artwork is important to retailers because CD- and 
cassette-size art does not promote browsing or impulse buying.) 
</P>
<P>
I've written record companies about this, but no one has responded. My proposal 
is easy to implement, and it helps a cause in which we all should participate 
-- restoring our environment.

ETHICS OF HOLLYWOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
Nowhere does Mathews suggest that L.A. County's film industry earns, in our 
time of industrial humiliation, an enormous favorable balance of trade for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Films have done so for decades, without one nickel of government subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
He also omits the huge incomes that films bring to Los Angeles -- all without 
polluting underground water or the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of the print industry would disclose Byzantine plotting that destroys 
publishing empires and other excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Calendar's peek under the skirts of movie production is more like a "Cinema 
Vice" TV episode than a balanced report.

this faulty gene, you have a 50% chance of inheriting it. 
</P>
<P>
2. True. 
</P>
<P>
3. True.

BICYCLING IS ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST FORMS OF EXERCISE, ONE FOR WHICH THE ADAGE, 
'NO PAIN, NO GAIN,' IS UTTERLY FALSE

Persevere, Persevere," the college students yell from the microbus as I inch 
towards the pass, 12,094 feet high, on Trail Ridge Road in Colorado's Rocky 
Mountain National Park. I'm no Olympian athlete, pedaling up here among the 
clouds. In fact, I have two bad knees that I wouldn't run on to save my life. 
But this amazing 15-speed bike, with gear ratios low enough to climb trees, has 
made cycling up past the timberline easy for me. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a good quality lightweight bicycle with gear ratios that allow me to 
haul 20 pounds of equipment over the Continental Divide would make it possible 
for grandmothers and grandfathers to climb the hills overlooking Topanga Canyon 
without straining. And even without straining, cycling remains one of the 
healthiest forms of exercise, one for which the adage, "no pain, no gain," is 
utterly false. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor of my parents -- a plumpish, middle-aged British woman -- used to go 
everywhere on an old English 3-speed, refusing out of principle to drive. One 
Christmas, her husband gave her a new 10-speed. "It just whizzes along!" she 
exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 m.p.h., an easy cruising speed for a nonathlete, the miles accumulate 
quickly; 50 in five hours, or enough to cross the country in two months and 
have plenty of time left over for sight-seeing. 
</P>
<P>
I ride nearly 4,000 miles a year, or an average of a little more than 10 miles 
a day. Half is city commuting, 10% is extended touring, and the rest is 
recreation. One of the beauties of bicycling is that I can combine exercise and 
transportation, thereby saving the time and money that I might otherwise spend 
on a health club. 
</P>
<P>
The value of exercise has been well-documented. A variety of recent studies 
confirm that people who exercise regularly, if only for as little as 20 minutes 
a day, three times a week, suffer fewer heart attacks than those who do not. 
Exercise also helps keep the bones and joints healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Exercise prevents heart attacks by reducing the load on the heart. The heart of 
a normal white-collar nonathlete beats 75 to 80 times a minute, but training 
can drive the resting rate of the best athletes down to a lazy 40 beats a 
minute, saving nearly 60,000 beats a day. 
</P>
<P>
Exercise accomplishes this by building up every element of the cardiovascular 
system. The lungs of a well-trained athlete have greater volume, the blood 
vessels are more extensive and each heartbeat pumps more blood than in the 
nonathlete. 
</P>
<P>
But not all exercise improves cardiovascular efficiency. Only exercise that 
leaves you huffing and puffing, so-called aerobic exercise, does the job. The 
heart has little to gain from weight lifting and Nautilus machines. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of energy you use during exercise provides a measure of aerobics. A 
typical American adult uses up between 2,000 and 3,000 kilocalories daily. Even 
a sedentary person uses energy just maintaining body temperature and other 
physiological functions. Doonesbury's Zonker Harris burns about 100 
kilocalories per hour just vegging out. A volleyball player uses up about 350 
an hour. A 4-mile walk requires a little more than 300 kilocalories; a 13 
m.p.h. cycling jaunt takes 660 in the same amount of time. Running is one of 
the few activities that is usually more intensive than cycling; the runner 
burns 900 kilocalories an hour at 10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that running is great exercise, if your back and knees can 
take the pounding. But my knees began to give me trouble when I was in my 
mid-20s. In fact, an orthopedist told me not only to stop running but to quit 
riding my bicycle after he diagnosed chondromalacia, a chronic inflammation of 
the cartilage that forms the bearing surface of the knee-cap. 
</P>
<P>
I did so, for two years, and during that period, I sometimes had trouble even 
walking more than a mile or so. But the itch to get back into action was so 
strong that one day I set out on the District of Columbia's towpath, one of the 
flattest, arrow-straight and most scenic hiking and biking trails in the 
country. I proceeded gingerly, letting the weight of my legs push the pedals. 
After 4 miles up and 4 miles back, my knees felt OK. And my flouting of the 
orthopedist's advice led to the discovery that -- for me -- cycling is harmless 
in moderation. 
</P>
<P>
The towpath ride became a ritual, several times a week, and as I upped my 
distance, I discovered that when I bicycled 10 miles or more, my knees seemed 
to improve slightly. Over the next few weeks, my feet began to push on the 
pedals as if of their own accord. Then one day, I raced through Rock Creek 
Park, visions of pedaling over mountains once again dancing through my head. 
When I got home, instead of having aches to dampen my spirits, my knees felt 
better than ever. Later that summer, on a car trip around Colorado, I drove 
Trail Ridge Road, and at the pass I encountered three cyclists who had traveled 
all the way from Oregon. Oh, didn't I wish I was cycling up there myself? And 
four years later, my dreams of mountain climbing would come true. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, my knees are far from perfect, and I cannot afford to forget it. 
The right one has stopped me in my tracks on occasion (although timely 
application of ice has kept such instances to a minimum.) The left knee merely 
slows me down from time to time. To cope with bad knees, you must face your 
limitations squarely. Only then are you ready to learn, through a tedious 
process of trial and error, to listen to your knees tell you how much you can 
do. A knee's signals that it has had enough can be amazingly subtle. All this 
does not keep me from touring, however, and last year I completed a 500-mile 
ride through southern France. As always, my knees are at their best at the end 
of a tour. 
</P>
<P>
One reason that cycling should improve bad knees has to do with the fact that 
unlike most other body parts, cartilage -- the surfaces that allow the bones in 
a joint to slide smoothly against one another -- contains no blood vessels. 
Nutrients and waste products have no way to enter and leave cartilage, except 
by passive diffusion from the joint fluid, sort of like water in and out of a 
sponge. The sedentary life style does nothing to aid that diffusion, and a 
violent sport such as running would risk aggravating the inflammation. But the 
gentle flexion of cycling is the elixir of the kneecap. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that cycling strengthens the quadriceps. Bad knees often 
result because the kneecap fails to stay in its groove properly. Stronger 
muscles help keep it there. (Doctors often prescribe leg weightlifting for bad 
knees.) 
</P>
<P>
Although cycling can be good for bad knees, poor technique can cause or 
aggravate bad knees. The no-pain, no-gain philosophy of exercise is probably 
what makes many novices pedal in the highest, hardest gear that they can 
manage. Slow pedaling in hard gears builds brute strength but not stamina. It 
also puts a huge strain on cartilage. Fast pedaling in gears that turn with 
ease is what builds stamina, and stamina is what it takes to climb mountains or 
to pedal for several hours without feeling tired. 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense if you think of using gears on a bicycle the way you use gears 
in a car. Low gears are for hill climbing and quick starts, since you get the 
most power at high revolutions per minute. But cyclists don't have to shift 
into high to save gas, so it makes sense to pedal in the lowest, instead of the 
highest gear you can handle. (It also makes cycling more of an aerobic 
exercise.) The correct pedaling speed is 60 to 120 revolutions of the crank a 
minute, preferably 90-plus. You can time your pedaling speed with a second 
hand, and there are bicycle computers available that give instant readouts of 
cadence. 
</P>
<P>
Learning proper pedaling technique made a huge difference for me. The first day 
of my tour through New England, in 1974, before I'd heard the word on spinning 
-- what cyclists call fast pedaling -- my Peugeot felt like a ton of bricks. I 
conked out after 50 miles and had trouble climbing into the loft at a youth 
hostel where I spent the afternoon sleeping. One year later, that day was 
uppermost in my mind as I prepared to depart Seattle for Boston, just after my 
graduation from Berkeley. By this time, I had internalized fast pedaling so 
that I was no longer conscious of doing it. I was worrying about how heavy the 
Peugeot was going to feel again, with 20 pounds of gear strapped to the rack. 
Tomorrow I would face Stevens Pass in the Cascades, a several-thousand-foot 
climb. Would I make it? 
</P>
<P>
I mounted the bike in the morning drizzle. The sun would ultimately pierce the 
persistent overcast of the Pacific Northwest. I pushed hard on the pedals to 
move those bricks, but to my surprise, the bicycle took off like a sports car. 
Is this really happening, I wondered as I slowed down to accelerate again, to 
test what I thought might be the illusion of my new-found power. That day, the 
hills became friends of mine, and the next day, the views of the peaks and 
valleys of the Cascades unfolded like an aurora borealis as I effortlessly 
ascended the switchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The novice spinner quickly gets winded. That changes in time, as the leg 
muscles develop a high concentration of mitochondria, those metabolic 
machinery-containing cells within cells that turn food into power. 
</P>
<P>
One obstacle to proper pedaling technique is that most road bikes (as opposed 
to mountain bikes) lack gear ratios low enough to make steep hill-climbing 
easy, despite 10, 12, or even 14 speeds. Too many people think that low gears 
are for wimps, or else that they are unimportant since you can always walk a 
bike up a hill. Don't believe them: There is nothing more awkward than walking 
a fully-loaded bicycle up a steep hill. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, it is so easy to change gear ratios that many bicycle stores will 
do it free when you buy a new bicycle. (For a more complete explanation of 
gearing, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to Bicycling magazine, Rodale 
Press, Emmaus, Pa. 18049 and request a reprint of the March, 1981, issue on 
gears.) 
</P>
<P>
Proper gear ratios are only part of what goes into a high quality bicycle. 
Other qualities that make a difference: 
</P>
<P>
Stiff frame. When you pedal hard, some of the energy goes to twisting the frame 
instead of turning the rear wheel. Quality bicycles have stiff frames to 
prevent most of this energy from going down the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Weight. Cyclists measure weight the way the Post Office does, in ounces. My 
29-pound Peugeot was light enough for me to pedal across the country when I was 
22. Now the thing mostly sits idle in my basement while I tool around on my 
22-pound Klein. 
</P>
<P>
Weight on the wheels counts double what it counts anywhere else on the bike. 
The reason is that to move this weight, one must overcome the inertia of 
gaining circular motion as the wheel spins, as well as forward motion. For that 
reason, mountain bikes with their fat tires are slower than road bikes. 
</P>
<P>
Friction -- Inferior bearings eat up pedal power, as do low-pressure tires. 
Most good bicycles come with tires that take at least 90 pounds of pressure. 
Always keep them fully inflated. 
</P>
<P>
Cost -- A decent bicycle costs at least $250 to $300 and can easily exceed 
$500. (Don't even think about getting a cut-rate brand.) 
</P>
<P>
All in all, the bicycle is the most efficient form of transportation for human 
beings. At 10 m.p.h., a cyclist is getting the energy equivalent of 1,000 
m.p.g. With such economy, small wonder that the basic bicycle has remained 
unchanged since it became a commercial success in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the secret of the bicycle's longevity is its basic geometry, which is 
nothing but a front and a rear triangle. The triangle is the most stable 
polygon, so the double-triangle design allows the bicycle to be about as light 
and as strong as possible. Back in college days, a friend and I spent a few 
hours over coffee, trying to come up with a better design. We couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
Unbeknown to us, others had invented another bicycle design. The rider of the 
so-called recumbent bicycle sits in an actual chair that is mounted to the 
frame legs out in front, in the position of lounging in an easy chair. Needless 
to say, the comfort of a recumbent is luxurious. But that is not its only 
advantage. The laid- back posture reduces wind drag, and one recumbent owner 
told me that his average cruising speed on flat terrain had increased from 12 
m.p.h. on a conventional bike to 17 m.p.h. with the recumbent. That is not 
surprising. On a conventional bike, wind resistance accounts for more than 80% 
of total drag at speeds of about 18 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of the recumbent has to do with safety. It is virtually 
impossible to fly off the bicycle head first, and in the event of a crash, the 
rider would land on his feet instead of his head, says David Gordon Wilson, a 
MIT mechanical engineering professor and a long-time proponent of the 
recumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the hunched-over position on a conventional bike creates a feeling of 
tunnel vision. The recumbent cyclist feels like he has traded the view out the 
rear window of an old Volkswagen for a seat in a convertible. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 104-year-old safety bicycle, so named because it was much safer than 
the high-wheelers it replaced, retains many advantages over the recumbent. The 
recumbent frame, which is often a flattened and stretched out version of the 
safety-bicycle frame, is neither as light nor as strong as the latter. With an 
extra 5 or 6 pounds, the quicker-in-the-flats recumbents lose their speed 
advantage when hill climbing. The matter of relative safety remains 
controversial, because the low-slung recumbents are less visible in traffic. On 
a conventional bike, you can avoid road shock by lifting your rear slightly out 
of the saddle and letting your bent knees absorb the shock. On a recumbent, 
your body has to take the bumps. The long wheelbases of most recumbents make 
them handle like busses. The only well-designed short-wheelbase recumbent in 
commercial production, the Lightning, costs more than $1,300. And the 
configuration of the recumbent makes walking your bike next to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
All of these shortcomings do not dampen the enthusiasm of recumbent owners. The 
real reason recumbents have not caught on, in my opinion, is price. No really 
good recumbents retail for less than about $700. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the recumbent, a variety of recent innovations in bicycle technology 
are making the conventional safety bicycle smoother and more responsive. Of 
these, only bicycles of oversized aluminum tubing are in large-scale production 
at competitive, everyday prices. 
</P>
<P>
These aluminum bicycles are lighter and stiffer than their steel counterparts, 
which gives them something of a leg up in races. What is surprising is that by 
many accounts, including my own, they ride smoother and hold the road better 
than steel models. Why that is so (or if it is so) is a matter of controversy. 
Gary Klein, who helped develop and commercialize the technology, says that 
aluminum rides better because there is less weight to bounce up and down over 
bumps. Others suggest that the material absorbs shock better, noting that no 
one makes bells out of aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the cutting edge are carbon-fiber bicycles. It is hard to generalize 
about the handling characteristics of that technology, says Ted Constantino, 
editor of Bicycle Guide magazine, because the frames are so diverse. Some 
carbon-fiber bikes have conventional triangular frames composed of tubing, but 
carbon-fiber technology makes possible the so-called monocoque, single-member 
frames of various strange shapes that are often designed by computer to 
maximize strength and lightness. Carbon-fiber technology shaves off half a 
pound to a pound compared to the weight of the better steel frames, and "the 
shock-dampening qualities are excellent," Constantino says. "Over the course of 
an 80-mile ride, you find you are not bracing for the bumps." 
</P>
<P>
For years, carbon-fiber bikes sold at very high prices and had durability 
problems. But prices have declined to about $1,000 for some models, and a few 
manufacturers are even offering lifetime warranties. 
</P>
<P>
But the nirvana of bicycle frames are those of titanium, Constantino says. 
"It's incredibly light, it has really good shock dampening, it's fabulously 
strong and it won't corrode." Unfortunately, the metal is so hard to work that 
the frames cost a fortune. It is hard to get a fully equipped titanium bicycle 
for much less than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The titanium is tempting, but for the near future, anyway, I'll be riding my 
aluminum Klein. On the last day of last spring's bicycle trip through southern 
France, the Klein had 10,000 miles on it. In the three years that I have owned 
it, I have toured Colorado, the Canadian Rockies and France's Brittany Coast. 
My daily forays through Washington frequently take me past the Jefferson 
Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, Kennedy Center and on up through Rock Creek 
Park. I see an awful lot of beauty from the saddle, and riding keeps my resting 
pulse down around 60 beats a minute. 
</P>
<P>
With that and decent heredity, as well as healthy though not-fanatical eating 
habits, I expect to be around 50 years from now. And if I am, I am sure I'll be 
riding my bicycle in the year 2040.

STRESS IS AN IRKSOME PART OF LIFE; YET SOME SEEM TO COPE, EVEN THRIVE, UNDER 
IT. SIX CALIFORNIANS TELL HOW THEY MAINTAIN THEIR EQUILIBRIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KATHLEEN DOHENY, Doheny is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly to 
The Times.

<P>
Midway through a steamy Friday afternoon, a tanker truck overturned on the 
Golden State Freeway northwest of downtown Los Angeles, spewing gasoline near 
the Colorado Street exit. Caltrans predicted that the tie-up would last until 
at least 7 p.m. Work-weary drivers swore, snarled and chain-smoked their way up 
the pavement, nearly all of them looking impatient -- except the pony-tailed 
woman in the battered white van. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly oblivious to the sea of cars and trucks, the woman plucked a guitar 
with one hand and steadied the steering wheel with the other. Her solution to 
traffic-jam Angst wouldn't win an award from the California Highway Patrol. But 
in the eyes of stress-reduction experts, her heart -- if not her hands -- is in 
the right place. 
</P>
<P>
Stress, as anyone breathing knows, is a part of life. And it's becoming a 
bigger part, according to a 1989 Louis Harris Survey conducted for Prevention 
magazine. Last year, 63% of Americans polled reported feeling "great stress" at 
least once a week. Six years ago, only 55% said they felt greatly stressed that 
often. And, the survey found, stress most often strikes those with the highest 
and lowest incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, some people seem to cope, even thrive, under stress. What follows are 
stories of how a few Southern Californians manage to maintain their physical 
and mental equilibrium despite their demanding pace. 
</P>
<P>
BING CLAWSBY, PART Siamese and totally arrogant, prances away from Michael 
Feinstein's concert grand piano and out of the living room of his Hollywood 
Hills home. He cares not a whit that he's supposed to be posing for a 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Bing is spoiled, as Feinstein is the first to admit. Feinstein indulges the 
feline, advising the photographer that his four-legged subject may or may not 
be back. "When I'm gone on tour," says Feinstein, a concert pianist and singer, 
"four people come by to take care of him." Bing's important to him not merely 
for companionship but for stress reduction. "They've done research, you know, 
that animals are wonderful for reducing stress," says Feinstein, scooping up 
Bing as the cat returns and coaxing him back under the photographic lights. 
"Just spending time playing with him is relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's schedule is anything but relaxing. In the past three years, he has 
made his Broadway debut in a standing-room-only concert, played to overflow 
audiences at the Hollywood Bowl and performed a live concert filmed for a BBC 
one-hour television special. Last September, his sixth album, a collection of 
MGM movie songs, was released. A devotee of American popular music of the '20s, 
'30s and '40s, Feinstein, 33, grew up in the Midwest listening to the music of 
George and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin and Cole Porter. Feinstein has won rave 
reviews from the nation's press, which has dubbed him "the master of the 
high-class cabaret circuit" and praised his "unique rendition of vintage show 
tunes." 
</P>
<P>
To cope with the stress of new-found fame, Feinstein has developed an eclectic 
program. Besides Bing Clawsby's companionship, he relies on exercise. He uses a 
rowing machine -- folded up under his grand piano when not in use -- at least 
three times a week when he's not on the road. Says Feinstein: "I don't 
particularly like exercise, but I feel better when I do it." 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, he does his exercises in reflexology, a system of hand and foot 
massage to promote health and reduce stress. "Another thing I do for relaxation 
is meditation," he adds. Feinstein also pays attention to his diet but not to 
the bathroom scale, a plan that appears to work for the trim pianist. But don't 
label him perfect. He confesses to occasional binges. "Chocolate and pizza," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Learning to say no to professional demands helps keep Feinstein on an even keel 
as well. "When you become successful," he says, "the first thing you do is say 
yes to everything." He's learned to resist. And even if he can spare only a few 
days off, he tries to get away. Joshua Tree and Angeles Forest are two favorite 
nearby destinations. He escapes when he can to his new second home in Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein even finds relaxation in the source of his stress. "Music can alter 
your mood and transport you to another place. I can be in a very bad mood. But 
when I go on stage, I'm immediately in better spirits." 
</P>
<P>
EVEN THROUGH SHADED windows, the sun was bright enough for Karen Snyder to slip 
on her sunglasses before settling in to resume her shift as an air-traffic 
controller at John Wayne Airport in Orange County. This particular morning 
promised to be more demanding than usual. One runway had been closed, so 
taxiing planes that ordinarily would be turned left would have to be directed 
to turn right. 
</P>
<P>
In a given hour, estimates Snyder (who was recently transferred to Tucson 
International Airport), she's involved in about 125 transmissions -- some 
brief, others complicated. Twelve commercial planes plus numerous private 
aircraft can leave the airport during that time. Snyder's work hours are 
staggered. Within a week, her shifts can range from early morning to evening. 
Plane crashes are always a possibility. Last year, Snyder witnessed one that 
killed a family of five. Two minutes after takeoff, the plane went down and 
exploded in flames, narrowly missing players on a nearby tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is when there's nothing you can do, when you must just sit 
there and watch," says Snyder, who took a half-hour break after the crash and 
then returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are what Snyder, 33, describes as lesser hassles, including pilots 
who argue on the frequency. "They'll argue about all kinds of things. If they 
can't have the runway they want, or because they have been waiting for a long 
time to depart." To defuse them, Snyder's learned to keep her sense of humor. 
"Some pilots make fun of others' landings," she says, laughing. "Some make 
comments like 'Take that, runway.' " 
</P>
<P>
Off-duty, Snyder relies on exercise to quell stress. A triathlete, she swims 
six days a week, runs about an hour a day and bicycles three times a week. She 
lifts weights for two hours three times a week. But her stress-reduction 
techniques aren't all physical. Somewhere between eating right and pumping 
iron, she tries to squeeze in a good junk novel or two. 
</P>
<P>
And she's been known to rely on old-fashioned exasperation to get her sanely 
through a shift. It worked the morning of the runway closure, when one pilot 
couldn't seem to comprehend Snyder's crystal-clear directions to get off the 
Tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
"I am off the runway," he insisted, although parked smack in the middle. Snyder 
begged -- politely -- to differ and repeated her instructions through gritted 
teeth, at first to no avail. When the pilot finally moved and Snyder was sure 
he was safe -- and out of earshot -- she employed a little impromptu stress 
reduction. "What an idiot!" she muttered, setting off peals of laughter in the 
control tower. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN WORK GETS too hectic for Josh Reynolds, the Santa Monica entrepreneur goes 
in for a "relaxation tune-up." 
</P>
<P>
His personal body shop is in the Beverly Hills office of Dr. Gary Jay, a 
headache and pain-control specialist, who leads Reynolds into the Environ, a 
sensory stimulation "space-capsule." Jay and Frank Italiane designed the 
computer-controlled unit to teach people the relaxation response. As the user 
sits on a comfortable, vibrating chair, lights flash and a relaxation tape 
plays. Pleasant aromas waft in. Using biofeedback and neurological and 
psychological technology, the unit aims to quell both chronic and acute stress. 
A half hour in the unit, Reynolds and others attest, leaves users disinclined 
to swear in traffic or blow up at life's minor annoyances.

Reynolds, 47, who counts the mood-stone ring as one of his inventions, uses the 
Environ about once a month, whenever he gets "out of groove." That's easy to 
do, considering his 12-hour-a-day schedule as chairman of Molecular Electronics 
in Torrance. Reynolds is developing products such as "tissue-friendly" contact 
lenses that repel bothersome protein deposits. He anticipates that the lenses 
will be on the market within a year or so. Until then, he's got much to 
accomplish, including the completion of a joint-venture agreement with a 
manufacturer and additional fund-raising for payroll and research. Reynolds 
spends about a week a month on the road, jetting to Europe, New York and Canada 
to meet with venture capitalists and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
To keep himself in sync between Environ tuneups, Reynolds listens to back-up 
relaxation tapes at home and occasionally goes to mineral baths. "And I get a 
massage every two or three weeks." Other sure-fire stress busters are tennis 
and vegetarian cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Divorced, Reynolds spends as much weekend time as possible with his 8-year-old 
daughter, Christina, who lives nearby with her mother. He's adamant about 
squeezing work into the workweek -- not letting it spill into the weekend. 
</P>

AT WORK,DR. SOTERIA Karahalios finds herself in a double bind. As a 
cardiologist, she often must instruct her patients to reduce stress, slow down 
and learn to take life a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, she dispenses this advice as she's dashing from one patient to the 
next, trying to keep up with the demands of her busy Santa Monica group 
practice and her work as director of cardiac rehabilitation at nearby St. 
John's Hospital and Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a new, if joyful, source of stress came on the scene. Karahalios and 
her husband, Dr. Alexander Dubelman, a cardiac anesthesiologist at Brotman 
Medical Center in Culver City, welcomed their first baby, Andreas Dubelman. 
Healthy now, the baby had a rough start, suffering respiratory problems so 
severe that he stopped breathing six times in three days, Karahalios recalls. 
"We thought the baby might die." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Karahalios cut back a bit on her duties so she could spend two 
afternoons a week with Andreas. Now she's back to her practice full-time. It's 
a full week, typically crammed with 12-hour workdays along with on-call duties 
one day a week and one weekend a month. "The patients we take care of need you 
there quickly," notes Karahalios, who can reach the hospital from her 
Mandeville Canyon home in seven minutes. "When it comes to the decision about 
treatment after a heart attack, the sooner the better." 
</P>
<P>
When life gets really hectic, she tries to escape with her family to Monterey, 
where they have a second home. If time allows, they travel to Greece, where 
many of her relatives live. Exercise helps, too. Complaining that she still has 
"baby fat" to shed, Karahalios runs 2 to 4 miles a day and bicycles with her 
husband on weekends. "Running helps keep my weight down and makes me feel as if 
I've had a chance to play," says Karahalios, 38. 
</P>
<P>
She's almost embarrassed to mention another stress reducer: her house plants. 
"I have about 30 plants. I go through the house, cut the dead leaves off and 
water the plants." 
</P>
<P>
WHENEVER A MEDICAL advance occurs, Ramon Aninag anticipates a busier-than-usual 
day. As an administrative assistant at UCLA's Health Sciences Communications 
office, he knows he'll be fielding more than the usual number of telephone 
calls from reporters, asking for a university expert to comment on anything 
from new AIDS research to the latest cure for hiccups. 
</P>
<P>
From 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. -- "I don't eat lunch" -- Aninag takes seriously his 
role as the first impression most callers have of the university. In a typical 
day, he handles up to 100 telephone calls. Besides calls from media, there are 
inquiries from physicians hoping to get help publicizing their research, along 
with a goodly share of misdirected calls. "Sometimes I can hear in the callers' 
voices that they've been transferred six times," he says, so he tries to be 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not answering phones, Aninag, 32, may be helping one of the 12 staff 
members with a computer problem in his newly added role of computer system 
trouble-shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Staying stress-free seems easy for Aninag, who loves fast social dancing and 
often dances until the wee hours on weekends. He tries to visit the gym 
regularly for weightlifting and other exercises. And he refuses to give in to 
frazzled freeway nerves. "I leave my car at home to reduce stress and save 
money," he says. "Parking is expensive." Instead, he catches the bus and 
relaxes during the 20-minute ride. 
</P>
<P>
CARLOS 'N CHARLIE'S on Sunset Boulevard was crammed full of record industry 
executives on a recent Saturday night. Next on stage was Joyce Simpson, one of 
five featured acts in the showcase evening designed to catch the eyes and ears 
of industry bigwigs. Clad in a silver sequined sheath, the vocalist cooed her 
way through the numbers. And wasn't the least bit nervous, she claimed later. 
</P>
<P>
This is just Simpson's after-hours diversion, after all. By day, she works as 
an administrator of international advertising for Warner Bros. in Burbank. She 
manages ads for films in 10 countries, handling seven or eight movies at once. 
Her job entails much telephone work. "In the morning, I'm talking to Europeans. 
After lunch, it's the Australians. Evenings, it's Far Easterners. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always working in the past, present and future," says Simpson, referring 
to the stages of production of the movies. "I'm dealing with so many movies at 
one time, I can start 10 or 15 projects a day. And I'm always working against a 
deadline." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she also had to squeeze in a few conversations with the police. "In 
seven months, my car was stolen four times," moans Simpson, 30, who traded it 
after the last recovery. 
</P>
<P>
She's learned to handle her stressful schedule partly by paying attention to 
diet and exercise. Every other day, she gets up earlier than usual and walks 2 
miles in her neighborhood. "It makes me feel good and helps me put things in 
perspective." She tries to watch her diet and recently cut out all sweets. 
"It's made a difference," she says. Other tried-and-true stress busters: taking 
herbal baths with relaxing background music and turning a deaf ear to the 
outside world once she's home. "I don't ever answer the phone at home. I leave 
my answering machine on."

A MATTER OF SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

It's difficult to establish how safe bicycling is. In 1985, 1,300 people died 
and another 574,000 were treated in emergency rooms following cycling injuries. 
Those numbers may sound small compared to the totals of auto fatalities and 
injuries -- more than 45,000 and 3 million respectively during the same period 
-- but there are no figures on the number of bicycle miles traveled per year to 
serve as a comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclists can do much to protect themselves. Rule No. 1 is never to ride without 
wearing a helmet approved for bicycle use by either the Snell Foundation or the 
American National Standards Institute, or both. Head injuries cause or 
contribute to death in 70% to 80 % of cycling-related fatalities. In a study 
published in the May 25, 1989 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, 
researchers reported that riders wearing helmets "had an 85% reduction in their 
risk of head injury, and an 88% reduction in their risk of brain injury." 
</P>
<P>
Children are especially at risk for head injuries from cycling. A Canadian 
study found that, among children, cycling was the No. 1 cause of head injuries 
that resulted in hospital admissions. A Swedish study concluded that children 
younger than 11 or 12 "simply do not have the maturity to handle themselves in 
anything but the simplest traffic situation." Also, small children are less 
able than adults to localize sounds or see out of the corners of their eyes. 
They have less strength and coordination. Finally, children are more likely to 
have bicycles that do not fit or are poorly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
All riders should follow basic rules of the road. Statistics from the Insurance 
Institute for Highway Safety suggest that people who drive like moms and dads, 
the Ward and June Cleavers of the world, are the least likely to be injured in 
car accidents: Injury claims are considerably lower for station wagons than for 
sedans, and lower for sedans than coupes. Undoubtedly, cyclists who ride 
carefully are less likely to get hurt than hot-doggers. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of accidents happen at intersections. Cyclists should watch out for 
oncoming and left-turning cars and should ride well away from buses or other 
large vehicles that might hide them from oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to avoid getting snagged by an opening door of a parked car is to 
ride beyond its reach. Bicycles are rarely hit from behind in slow, daytime 
urban traffic, so cyclists need not be shy about asserting their right to the 
road. If someone opens a door on you and there's no possibility of swerving out 
of the way, scream at the top of your lungs and hit the brakes. Don't waste 
time trying to ring a little bell. 
</P>
<P>
To guard against getting hit from behind, use a rear-view mirror. I have worn 
mirrors on my spectacles or in my helmet since 1975, and I prefer the Third 
Eye, a brand that mounts on the helmet. It's small, but its view is terrific, 
and you can pan simply by turning your head. Having a rear-view mirror means 
being able to communicate with the cars behind you: If they are coming too 
close, I signal them to slow down, by showing the palm of my left hand; or to 
suggest that they move out into the other lane, with a flick of the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from careful riding, cyclists can minimize their chance of injury by 
wearing bright clothing. I wear mostly bright yellow, said to be the most 
visible common color in daylight. When the temperature is brisk, I wear my 
phosphorescent-looking lime-green jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The most visible colors by day are not necessarily visible when the sun does 
down. Red is extremely hard to see after dark. White is the most visible color 
at night. However, white at night is no substitute for strong headlights and 
taillights, although it is a good supplement. 
</P>
<P>
When you buy a helmet, make it a brightly colored one, especially if you do a 
lot of biking at night. David Holzman

HOLD THE MAYO?; 
</P>
<P>
YES, AND GO EASY ON THE MUSTARD AND KETCHUP, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sandwich ingredients -- beef, ham, cheese, and bread -- have all come under 
nutritional scrutiny. But what about mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup and other 
condiments? The two danger points here are sodium and, in one important case, 
fat. You can buy low-sodium mustard and Worcestershire sauce and "lite" 
versions of mayonnaise and even ketchup. Less familiar condiments such as 
chutney, horseradish and salsas are flavorful alternatives with few nutritional 
drawbacks, except that a few brands may contain large amounts of salt. 
</P>
<P>
Mayonnaise. "Hold the mayo" is definitely the way to go. The only high-fat 
condiment, mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil, egg yolk and vinegar; the regular 
version is almost 100% fat. However, since it is made with liquid vegetable oil 
(usually soybean), mayonnaise is not particularly high in saturated fat. 
Despite its egg content, it contains only a small amount of cholesterol -- 
about 5 milligrams per tablespoon. Thus "cholesterol-free" mayonnaise (now 
available) would not be a significant improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatives: Mayonnaise-like products labeled "salad dressing" -- as well as 
"light," "diet," or "imitation" mayonnaise, in which water and starch or 
another thickener replace some of the oil -- may contain half to two-thirds the 
calories of real mayonnaise and less than half the fat. There's even a 
tofu-based product with only 1 gram of fat per serving. 
</P>
<P>
If your palate demands real mayonnaise, use a teaspoonful rather than a 
tablespoonful on a sandwich, or blend it with plain low-fat yogurt. Flavor the 
yogurt with a little mustard, lemon juice and pepper for dressing in chicken or 
tuna salad. Tartar sauce and the "secret sauce" used on fast-food hamburgers 
are both mayonnaise-based. Substitute a light mayonnaise or plain low-fat 
yogurt with a little chopped pickle mixed in. And though it's not usually 
suggested as a low-fat substitute, even sour cream is a better choice than 
mayonnaise when you're making a dip. A tablespoon of sour cream has about 25 
calories and 2.5 grams of fat -- a quarter the calories and fat in mayonnaise. 
And plain low-fat or nonfat yogurt is even better. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Homemade mayonnaise is not nutritionally superior to the store-bought 
kind. A standard recipe calls for 2 egg yolks and 1 cup of oil. And since it is 
made with raw eggs and without preservatives, homemade mayonnaise could be a 
source of salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
Ketchup. Although it consists mainly of tomatoes, the average ketchup is 20% 
sweetener and contains up to 180 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon. Even 
"lite" ketchup has a fairly high sodium level, although a dietetic brand 
labeled "low-sodium" contains practically no sodium. Other substitutes for the 
ketchup lover with a sodium problem include tomato paste or puree, or 
low-sodium or homemade spaghetti sauce (for use in recipes). Some brands of 
bottled Mexican salsa ranchera and taco sauce contain slightly less sodium than 
regular ketchup, as do Worcestershire sauce and pickle relish. Most chili 
sauces, steak sauces, barbecue sauces and cocktail sauces have even more sodium 
than ketchup. Perhaps the best option is to make your own Mexican-style salsa 
cruda (raw sauce) -- a combination of chopped tomatoes, chilies, onions, lemon 
or lime juice, and spices -- to satisfy your craving for a tomato topping. 
</P>
<P>
Mustard. Mustard's natural pungency tends to limit the amount one uses, but 
even a tablespoonful of prepared mustard packs a major sodium wallop. If you 
need to watch your sodium intake, buy a no-salt-added mustard. "Cut the 
mustard" with plain low-fat yogurt, or mix your own from dry mustard powder 
(you'll find basic directions on the package). Vary the strength, texture, and 
flavor by using water, vinegar or milk as the liquid; add whole mustard seeds 
or herbs if you wish. 
</P>
<P>
Chutney. Usually served with Indian food (but equally good with cheese, plain 
meats and poultry), chutneys are sweet-and-spicy fruit- or vegetable-based 
relishes. All contain negligible fat; however, Major Grey's, perhaps the most 
popular type of chutney, is made from brine-pickled mangoes and is therefore 
very high in sodium. Look for chutneys made from apples, tomatoes, cranberries 
and other fruits at health-food stores or specialty markets. If you can't find 
a salt-free chutney, choose one that has salt at the bottom -- not the top -- 
of the ingredients list. Or substitute apple, cranberry, or other fruit sauces, 
which are low in sodium and virtually fat-free. 
</P>
<P>
Horseradish. Though its pungency complements meat, poultry and vegetables, 
prepared horseradish is used far less frequently than mustard or ketchup. 
Although it is usually made with salt, its sodium content is fairly low. 
Combine it with low-sodium mustard for an eye-opening sandwich spread, blend it 
with plain low-fat yogurt to make a less biting sauce or dressing, or stir it 
into applesauce for a traditional Austrian accompaniment to beef. Powdered 
horseradish (found on the spice shelf) can be mixed with water or other 
condiments for a sauce.

BUSH KEEPS JAPAN OFF 'HIT LIST'; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE PRESIDENT POINTS TO RECENT AGREEMENTS BY TOKYO TO OPEN THE MARKET TO 
AMERICAN PRODUCTS. INDIA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S LIST OF 
THOSE WITH UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES.

<P>
President Bush, ignoring congressional pressure, announced Friday that he has 
decided not to place Japan on a "hit list" of countries with the worst trade 
barriers against U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
India is the only country his Administration has decided to keep on its list of 
nations targeted for unfair trading practices, Bush said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush hailed what he said was recent progress in easing U.S.-Japanese trade 
frictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Promoting a vibrant, open trading relationship with Japan remains a key trade 
priority of the Administration," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent agreement with Japan that included Japanese concessions on opening its 
markets to more U.S. goods was a "promising start," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush said, he was under no illusion that the agreement alone 
would "lead to an immediate improvement" in this nation's $49-billion trade 
deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, he was persuaded that Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and 
other Japanese leaders "share my commitment to ensuring that trade strengthens, 
rather than undermines, the friendship between our nations." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Administration named Japan, Brazil and India as the countries 
with the most offensive barriers to American trade. 
</P>
<P>
Japan and Brazil have won praise from the Administration for making significant 
concessions during negotiations aimed at opening their markets to American 
products. 
</P>
<P>
But India, which was cited last year for a ban on operations of foreign private 
insurance companies and for controls on foreign investment that distort trade, 
has refused to make concessions. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills said that India was targeted 
again because it has the most trade barriers of any non-communist country, and 
negotiations over the last year had made no progress. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of Congress had warned the Administration that it would be 
making a serious mistake if it failed to target Japan once more as a way of 
keeping pressure on the country to honor its market-opening commitments. 
</P>
<P>
But Hills rejected these arguments, saying that the Administration needed 
flexibility in its negotiating efforts with other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have made enormous progress with Japan in the last few months," 
she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said he was glad that 
the Administration had at least issued a new Super 301 list, although he was 
disappointed that Japan was not included. The 1988 trade law is known as Super 
301. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been little improvement in our trade deficit with that country, and 
I am a bit of a skeptic as to whether the recent agreements will make much of a 
difference," Bentsen said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 trade law required the Administration to issue a target list of 
countries with the most offensive trade barriers in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Let there be no mistake," Bush said. "This Administration is committed to free 
and fair trade. We want open markets and fair treatment for our products, 
services, investment and ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had also directed Hills to "give her highest priority" to seeking 
a conclusion by December of international trade liberalization talks now under 
way in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said India's refusal to seek a negotiated settlement of last year's 
trade case prompted the Administration to cite India again. 
</P>
<P>
While the designation of India was likely to meet with approval on Capitol 
Hill, the refusal to cite Japan was certain to raise heavy protests. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of Congress said that a failure to cite Japan would indicate that 
the Administration is not interested in carrying out the requirements of the 
toughest section of the 1988 trade law. The law provides a tight timetable for 
negotiating away barriers and provides for economic sanctions if the talks 
prove unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
They said Super 301 was written with Japan in mind and that Japan needed to be 
targeted again to ensure that it lived up to its new-found willingness to lower 
trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before the decision was announced, Hills lavished praise on both 
Japan and Brazil for their willingness to negotiate in good faith and said that 
citing Japan again could provoke a backlash in Tokyo, where the Kaifu 
government has been pushing to change Japan's trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan's case, there has been a flurry of trade agreements over the last 
month. Japanese negotiators agreed to open their markets for the sale of 
U.S.-made satellites, supercomputers and forest products -- the three product 
areas cited in last year's Super 301 case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japan and the United States earlier this month completed an 
interim agreement designed to attack broad-based structural barriers that are 
preventing American and other foreign companies from doing business in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Hills praised Brazil for undertaking a "fantastic change in policy" under newly 
elected President Fernando Collor de Mellor. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil has agreed to cut protectionist barriers and submit for international 
settlement the licensing restrictions on imports cited by the United States in 
last year's complaint.

GNP UP 2.1%; INFLATION RATE STRONGEST SINCE '81

<P>
The nation's first-quarter gross national product rose 2.1%, or $21.7 billion, 
with inflation making its strongest showing since 1981, the Commerce Department 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Higher food and energy prices, a result of early winter's unusually cold 
weather, accelerated inflation during the quarter to an annual rate of 6.5%, 
from 3.6%, as measured by the GNP fixed-weights price index. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in the index was the greatest since a 7.7% gain in 1981, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Villamil, the department's chief economist, said inflation rose to 
5.2%, excluding the often volatile food and energy prices and a pay raise for 
federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
He said inflationary pressures are expected to ease slowly during the rest of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our assessment is based on the ongoing thrust of monetary policy that aims for 
price stability, continued expansion of our productive base by the private 
sector and the likely unwinding of energy and food prices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Private economists agreed that the first-quarter upturn in inflation is likely 
the result of the unusual weather conditions at the beginning of the year and 
do not indicate a long-term period of higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic message is the economy has not slowed sufficiently to bend the back 
of inflation, let alone break it," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at 
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "Until we see these numbers slide down again, 
we'll have to be uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp, in Philadelphia, said 
the first-quarter inflation numbers were so distorted by weather conditions 
that they should be averaged with fourth-quarter figures. 
</P>
<P>
Doing this brings inflation's rise to about 4.6% and the GNP's gain to 1.2%, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe the fixed-weight (index) will roll off and inflation 
numbers will improve in the second quarter," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
During the fourth quarter of last year, the GNP rose 1.1%, or $11.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the larger than expected price rise, the first quarter showed some 
encouraging developments, Villamil said. 
</P>
<P>
First-quarter personal consumption gained $16.4 billion after an increase of 
$3.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Durable goods purchases rose $16.8 billion, 
largely from motor vehicle sales, after falling $16.1 billion in the previous 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Purchases of nondurable goods decreased $8.9 billion in the first quarter after 
rising by $300 million in the fourth quarter. Service expenditures were up $8.5 
billion during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Home heating expenses for fuel oil, electricity and natural gas decreased $13.1 
billion in the first quarter after rising $8 billion in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential investments increased $9.4 billion during the quarter after 
falling $7.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Residential real estate investment 
costs rose $3.8 billion in the first quarter from a decrease of $500 million in 
the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Net exports gained $6 billion in the first quarter after rising $9.9 billion in 
the fourth quarter. Exports rose by $1.4 billion from a gain of $13.5 billion, 
while imports decreased $4.6 billion from a rise of $3.6 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
When they found 11-year-old Billy Ruff hanged from a big maple tree he had 
loved to climb, innocence died in the hearts of his brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
They saw his killer everywhere, suspected everyone. The other Ruff children -- 
five were living when Billy died 33 years ago and three were born later -- 
lived with a fear so deep it darkened their every waking moment. It was a 
terror inspired by a real-life bogyman who preyed on happy, fresh-faced kids -- 
kids who loved raisin cookies and baseball. Kids like Billy. Kids like them. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us, at one time or another, didn't think we'd reach the age of 11," 
said Tim Ruff, who was 3 when Billy was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day three years ago, Christopher Ruff glanced up at the bulletin board 
in the police station where he worked and saw the face of the man who had 
killed the brother he never knew. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom and I knew, as soon as I called her," said Chris, 24, who was born eight 
years after his brother's death and two months after his father's. "We both 
started to shake and say, 'This is it!' " 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Chris Ruff saw the man again -- in Albany County Court 
being sentenced to life in prison for Billy's murder. 
</P>
<P>
It was not murder, however, that had put the killer's likeness on the 'wanted' 
poster; it was a sex crime involving a 10-year-old girl. The awful secret the 
Ruff family had hidden was that Billy had been sodomized before he died. 
</P>
<P>
"This sort of thing wasn't spoken about," Mildred Ruff said, sitting in her 
living room with six of her children. "People wouldn't talk about 
child-molesting. It was a hush-hush thing." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Billy Ruff disappeared, Smith Avenue, in the northwestern suburb of 
Albany where the family lived, was a street full of children set in a rural 
landscape of fields and trees. Billy was last seen alive on Saturday afternoon, 
Aug. 31, 1957. He had a pocket full of raisin cookies, and in one hand a length 
of frayed clothesline he planned to use to steer a homemade go-cart. He didn't 
show up for dinner. Mildred Ruff remembers wrapping his plate of lamb chops, 
boiled potatoes and corn on the cob in wax paper and putting it in the fridge. 
At 9 p.m., she called her husband at work, and he began a search that lasted 
until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
In her fitful sleep that night, Mildred Ruff had a dream or a vision, she 
wasn't sure which: "I saw Billy, on his knees, hanging by a rope." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way a friend's daughter found him the next day -- hanged with his 
own clothesline in a densely wooded lot where all the kids played, and 
continued to play for years after. 
</P>
<P>
The police interviewed hundreds of people. "They didn't care how many hours 
they put in," said Raymond Rasmussen, one of the first state police detectives 
on the case. "We got to feel very close and very compassionate for the family 
and what they'd been through." 
</P>
<P>
What they could not know was that the killer was among them. Then, in the noise 
and confusion of grieving and of police work, he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"The night of the wake, a priest friend of ours said, 'It may take 20 years, 
but nobody can keep this thing to themselves,' " Mildred Ruff said. "And I said 
if it takes 20 days, I'll lose my mind." 
</P>
<P>
But she found strength and faith enough to last her family through Billy's 
death and the loss of her husband eight years later. For years, she carried in 
her apron pocket a rosary her husband had given her. The black beads were worn 
to brown from constant fingering. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 days became 20 months. The investigation died down. The police stopped 
coming by with mug shots of child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years passed. The police came around one last time to tell the family 
that a forensics expert had decided Billy's death was accidental. His family 
scoffed; they knew the truth would surface, and that belief never wavered as 10 
years became 20, then 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what it's like to have a lot of unanswered questions," 
</P>
<P>
said John, born four years after Billy died. "But in the back of our minds, 
there was always the hope." 
</P>
<P>
There was also fear -- of the dark, of being alone, of getting too close to 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody grew up with a paranoia," Chris said. "We couldn't have a normal 
childhood because we were so damn scared. There's not one time we can walk into 
an empty house and feel safe. Not one of us." 
</P>
<P>
Regina, the oldest, 13 when Billy died, and Tommy, who was 5, told their mother 
they knew there was a bogyman because he got their brother. All the Ruffs -- 
Regina, Tom, Tim, Joe, Lisa, Jay, John and Chris -- worried he was out to get 
another of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd stand at the window, stand there and watch when people weren't home on 
time," said Lisa, who was 8 months old when Billy was murdered. "I remember 
standing at my bed in the back bedroom, looking out the window and knowing I 
was doing the same thing Mom was. We were always scared." 
</P>
<P>
Fear became something they lived and breathed. In time, they would pass it on 
to their wives and husbands, to their children. 
</P>
<P>
"I was terrorized by nightmares most of my life," Regina wrote in a recent 
letter to her mother. "I had to force myself to go anywhere. I was afraid of 
the dark and of the daylight. 
</P>
<P>
"All this destruction, all this fear -- and I am only one of eight. Multiply 
the damage to me by every other life this touched." 
</P>
<P>
While Billy's brothers and sisters struggled with demons, his killer was 
finishing a stint in the Air Force and spending short periods as an Albany 
police officer and an ironworker. He married three times and fathered two 
children with a fourth woman. In the 1970s he wandered the streets as a 
homeless alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was a man that had this on his mind all that time," Rasmussen said. 
"Maybe that caused him to become what he was." 
</P>
<P>
When the case was 24 years old, Chris and his brothers found some old newspaper 
clippings in the basement. "They wanted to know more," Mildred Ruff said. "They 
wanted to know why it was unsolved." 
</P>
<P>
From the state police she learned that the case file would soon be destroyed, 
as are records of all unsolved cases after 25 years. Mildred Ruff called 
Rasmussen, who by then was in charge of the state police Bureau of Criminal 
Investigation. He ordered the file saved. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, I guess I was always hoping someday, somebody would make an arrest 
in the case," Rasmussen said. "Comparing my thoughts and hopes that someday 
this might be resolved with how much space that little file took up in our huge 
records section -- there was no question in my mind what I should do." 
</P>
<P>
There was never any question in Chris Ruff's mind as to what he should do, 
either. He wanted to be a cop. As a child, he drew a self-portrait with a badge 
on his chest. He dropped out of college to work as a dispatcher for the police 
force of suburban Colonie. 
</P>
<P>
His mother says it was Providence that he missed a promotion to patrolman. That 
would have sent him to the police academy, and he would not have been in the 
station when the killer's photo was posted. 
</P>
<P>
Chris contacted the state police and met the next day with two senior 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked at the newspaper clippings and said, 'I think we may have 
something. This may be the missing link, the reason we could never find 
anything back then,' " Chris said. "They said, 'Don't get your hopes up. We'll 
keep an eye out for him, and we'll let you know.' " 
</P>
<P>
Months went by. Then came the break the police had been waiting for: Someone 
inquired about buying the killer's car, which had a lien against it at a local 
bank. The bank contacted police. Their man was in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning, he admitted molesting a 10-year-old girl but wouldn't talk 
about Billy Ruff. After he failed a lie-detector test, he wrote a note saying, 
in part, "I killed Billy and I need help." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he signed a confession of how he "threw the rope over a branch 
above my head, grabbed the rope and ran with it, pulling Billy up off the 
ground . . . (then) I ran like hell." 
</P>
<P>
It was only then, with the man in police custody, that Chris and his mother 
were ready to tell the rest of the family that the man who had confessed to 
Billy's murder was their own first cousin, Richard Ruff. Family had done this 
to family. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the day I found out, I've been enraged," Jay Ruff said, recalling 
his first encounter with his cousin in 1982. "He shook my hand. And that's 
what's enraged me ever since. Knowing what he'd done to my own brother, he 
shook my hand and breathed the air I was breathing." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ruff, 53, was sentenced this month for the first-degree felony murder 
of William Ruff Jr. He stood trial after recanting his confession, saying 
police had frightened him into it. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1957, Richard Ruff was 20 years old. On leave from the Air Force, he 
had dropped by his uncle's home that week to show off a red Chevy convertible, 
which Billy had admired. The day Billy's body was found, he was there with the 
family, just another grieving relative. He left soon after. Police never 
questioned him. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Ruff family attended all nine days of the trial, reliving the 
horror. They saw autopsy photos and heard testimony about the pain Billy had 
suffered. They also learned why he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"This little boy was a naive, sweet, 11-year-old kid, and he had this fellow 
sodomize him, and I'm sure the first words out of his mouth were: 'I'm going to 
tell my mother and father on you!' " said Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Daniel 
Dwyer. "The ultimate result was Richard was going to be found out, and he 
couldn't handle that." 
</P>
<P>
For the Ruffs there is relief in knowing the truth, knowing that the man who 
killed Billy will never hurt another child. They want other families to have 
faith that killers can be found, no matter how many years pass. But they also 
want them to know that solving the mystery cannot erase all the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived this for 33 years, we'll live it for another 33 years," Chris 
said. "There's no punishment that would equal what he did to our brother -- and 
to us.

Erik Means may sit on the edge of a majestic fiord someday and regale his 
grandchildren with tales of the old country -- the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Viking blood stirs in a few people every year, calling them to their ancestral 
homeland. A New Yorker settles on a remote Norwegian farm, a Coloradan in an 
arctic village, a native of sunny California in chilly Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
They are descendants of the 2 million Scandinavians who went to the United 
States in an exodus that peaked around 1900. Like Means, 27, they may have 
grown up hearing from their parents that Scandinavia was really home. 
</P>
<P>
Some seek roots, others economic opportunity, as their forebears did in 
leaving. Some married Scandinavians. 
</P>
<P>
"I finished college in Canada and didn't have any experience," said Means, a 
dual U.S.-Norwegian citizen reared in Hamilton, Canada. "My only real edge was 
that I was fluent in both Norwegian and English. The only place that was any 
good was Norway." 
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 U.S. citizens live in Norway and 11,000 in Sweden, but no record 
is kept of how many of those have roots in this region. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the ocean, Americans of Norwegian descent outnumber 
Norway's 4.2 million people. There are 4.3 million Americans of Swedish 
ancestry, roughly half Sweden's population of 8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more would come, at least for a while, if the opportunity presented 
itself," said Hans Eiyvind Naess, who directs a genealogical center in 
Stavanger, Norway. There are strict limits on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
In the poor years of the late 19th Century, about one person in four left 
Sweden and Norway for North America. Now, powerful industries and North Sea oil 
give Scandinavia one of the world's highest living standards. 
</P>
<P>
Romanticized tales of Scandinavia or hand-me-downs from homesick ancestors 
don't prepare the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to expect people to ride around in horse-drawn buggies, wearing 
traditional costumes," said Arthur Svennevik, a New Yorker now living on his 
ancestral farm in south Norway. 
</P>
<P>
"They expect things to be the way they were in the States 50 years ago and 
arrive to find that it is probably a more modern country than the United 
States," said Svennevik, who often spent summers in Norway as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are regular visits much help, said Knut Dybdal, a folklore researcher born 
in Norway and reared in Compton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to be a guest," he said. "It's another to settle. You can play 
by U.S. rules as a visitor. When you settle, you are expected to learn and play 
by Norwegian rules." 
</P>
<P>
One American called Scandinavia "deceptively familiar," seeming similar to the 
United States but fundamentally different. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Strid, a Swedish-American living in Stockholm, said the adjustment passes 
through phases. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it was like being in a giant amusement park; everything was fun 
because it was new," said Strid, 31, of Sacramento. After a couple years, 
everything seems wrong and annoying, then acceptance comes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Strid and others tried at first to assimilate, speaking only Nordic languages 
and associating with Scandinavian friends. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, like their fathers who sought fellowship among people from their 
own countries, many hunger for the company of other Americans and seek each 
other out. 
</P>
<P>
Apathy about baseball can become a passion for it. Lukewarm patriots may become 
fierce defenders of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Few are ready to return to the United States, but just as few say they have 
settled in Scandinavia for good, although the years pile up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here for a year or two, 13 years ago," said Svennevik, whose parents 
were Norwegian. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'll stay forever; forever is a long time," said Means, father 
of a Norwegian-Danish-American infant son. 
</P>
<P>
Despite high taxes, an unfamiliar and sometimes meddlesome welfare state and a 
daunting cost of living, most people interviewed said they are better off in 
Scandinavia than they had been in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends think it's propaganda when I tell them about my lifestyle here," 
said Strid, a free-lance writer. "Most Americans seem to have a short circuit 
when I tell them I live in Stockholm. They just don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Dybdal, whose home overlooks a magnificent fiord, said, "If I could have the 
house and the kind of lifestyle I have here, I'd probably move back to Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
The concept of home changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you move across the Atlantic, you never really have a home again," Dybdal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where home is," said Victoria Hybert, a native of Denver who 
moved to arctic Norway with her Norwegian husband in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Hybert had one Norwegian grandparent and was only vaguely aware of Norway, but 
"now I can't imagine moving back to the States." 
</P>
<P>
"Here it's safe, and people still do things like go for walks in the park on 
Sunday afternoons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants don't forget being Americans, but some watch their children 
become Scandinavians. 
</P>
<P>
"My three boys are more Norwegian than American," Hybert said. "But I'm always 
telling them stories about the States."

JORDAN VALLEY OFFERS CLUES ON HUMAN HISTORY

PELLA, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fertile hills around the ancient settlement of Pella are yielding traces of 
a million years of human activity in the Jordan Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists digging here for 12 years under the direction of Prof. Basil 
Hennessy of Sydney University in Australia have uncovered a record of human 
existence reaching back to Stone Age hunters and forward to Ottoman times, and 
most of the years in between. 
</P>
<P>
"With this single site, we will eventually be able to rewrite the entire 
archeological history of northern Jordan," said dig coordinator Alan Walmsley, 
also of Sydney University. 
</P>
<P>
Pella, watered by a perennial stream, lies at about sea level in the 
once-forested foothills of the northern Jordan Valley, 55 miles northwest of 
Amman. 
</P>
<P>
A popular picnic spot, especially when spring flowers carpet the hillsides, it 
once straddled ancient trade routes linking Arabia, India and China with Syria, 
Anatolia, Greece and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Villagers now graze flocks of sheep and goats among the remains of Roman, 
Byzantine and Islamic buildings that dot the slopes overlooking the Jordan 
river. 
</P>
<P>
But the visible ruins, less spectacular than the ancient rock city of Petra in 
the south or the Greco-Roman town of Jerash to the east, tell only a fraction 
of Pella's story. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of Pella is that we are establishing a historical and 
occupational sequence of the site from the very earliest periods down to the 
Ottoman era," said Ghazi Bisheh, director of Jordan's antiquities department. 
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery of an Abbasid settlement at Pella could help to change a 
widely held view that Jordan declined in population and importance after the 
Abbasids defeated the Omayyad dynasty and transferred the capital of the Muslim 
empire from Damascus to Baghdad in the mid-8th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"There's now strong archeological evidence that the decline was not as drastic 
or comprehensive as thought," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Occupation at Pella moved slightly north of earlier sites after an earthquake 
in AD 747. 
</P>
<P>
"It has given us the best collection of Abbasid pottery and glass in Jordan," 
said Australian archeologist Margaret O'Hea. "We have complete vessels dating 
from the 8th to the 10th Centuries, as well as a city street and a courtyard." 
</P>
<P>
The absence of earlier or later remains at the site, just three feet below the 
surface, allows precise dating. 
</P>
<P>
"Several seasons of meticulous work at Pella have allowed notable advances in 
our knowledge of the ceramic typology of the Byzantine, Omayyad and Abbasid 
periods," Bisheh said. 
</P>
<P>
Until geological changes culminating about 11,000 years ago, Pella lay by a 
giant lake known as Lissan of which the present-day Dead Sea and Sea of Galilee 
were part, Walmsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Stone tools to butcher animals were discovered at a camp used by 
hunter-gatherers near Pella around 17,500 BC. 
</P>
<P>
Basalt handmills, mortars and pestles found near Pella point to agriculture 
emerging after the end of an ice age brought warmer temperatures. The 
650-feet-deep lake slowly receded because of evaporation and movements in the 
Earth's crust. 
</P>
<P>
Excavation of a settlement at Wadi Hammeh, one mile from Pella, has shown that 
people of the Natufian period around 10,000 BC gathered wild barley and other 
plants, hunted gazelle, sheep and goats, and practiced arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Their mudstone slabs engraved with concentric square motifs -- prized finds for 
the Pella archeologists -- are among the earliest surviving "rock-art" from the 
prehistoric Near East. 
</P>
<P>
By the 16th or 15th Centuries BC, Pella appeared to have been a prosperous 
city, trading with Cyprus, Egypt and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
A beautifully carved ivory inlaid box from this period is among a range of 
cultural artifacts that include silver and jewelry, cosmetics in alabaster 
vessels, conch shells, steatite scarab signets, gold thread and bronze pins. 
</P>
<P>
The city's fortunes ebbed and flowed until it was abandoned for more than two 
centuries of Persian rule from 539 BC to 332 BC. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary historians began referring to Pella again after Alexander the 
Great conquered the Middle East in 333 BC and it enjoyed fresh prosperity in 
the 2nd and 1st Centuries BC, trading widely and minting its own currency. 
</P>
<P>
It continued to expand under Roman rule in the first 300 years after Christ and 
had a population of up to 25,000 in the Byzantine era in the 5th and 6th 
Centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Decline linked with earthquakes, invasions and plague affected Pella before the 
Muslim army defeated the Byzantines at nearby Fihil in AD 635 and subdued the 
city peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
Archeological evidence indicates that a Christian minority coexisted with the 
Muslims for centuries after the Islamic conquest, but Pella gradually lost its 
importance as a trading center and was abandoned sometime during the 16th 
Century.

The climate in the Persian Gulf, one of the harshest in the world, is eating 
away the buildings at the heart of its cities. 
</P>
<P>
Crumbling concrete is not good news for the region's oil-exporting nations, 
which are already in deficit due to falling oil prices in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Just when most gulf Arab states thought their basic economic infrastructures 
were complete, they face the seemingly never-ending expense of 
multibillion-dollar maintenance and reconstruction programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Operations and maintenance are going to be a big budget burden of the 1990s," 
said a gulf-based senior bank economist. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arises from a chemical reaction between the hot, humid climate and 
the ingredients used to make concrete, construction industry experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Governments are worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder whether the lessons from our experiences over the past 15 years are 
not always being given the consideration they deserve," Bahrain's Minister of 
Works, Power, and Water, Majid al-Jishi, told a conference in Manama. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the lessons are learned, he said, government and private money would 
continue to be wasted. 
</P>
<P>
The president of Bahrain's Society of Engineers, Hisham al-Shehaby, told the 
conference that quick solutions to the problems of deteriorating concrete did 
not look promising. 
</P>
<P>
British expert Adam Neville said reinforced concrete corrodes in the gulf three 
to four times faster than in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Summer temperatures of 100 to 120 degrees coupled with humidity often well over 
90% activate the chlorides in sand-based concrete, he explained. These 
corrosive salts oxidize a building's reinforcing steel rod skeletons and the 
whole edifice begins to crack and crumble. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is compounded because knowledge of these long-term corrosive 
effects was not sufficiently known when many buildings were built during a boom 
generated by high oil prices in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a lot of sand for concrete was taken from the gulf, and the sea 
salts -- full of corrosive chlorides, were not properly washed out -- the 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, better aggregates, purer water have been used, and there is better 
supervision. Concrete is water-proofed better," said one construction industry 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing can stop the climate completely. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate is very, very aggressive. You are still going to get problems in 
20 years. You will never get the 50 years you can expect in Europe," said one 
expert with a local construction company. 
</P>
<P>
Some older structures have proved too costly to repair. For example, two wings 
of Bahrain's Gulf Hotel, built in 1969, have been demolished. A hotel spokesman 
said they were deteriorating too rapidly because of high salt content. 
</P>
<P>
Without further technological advances, gulf Arab states face the costs, 
including depreciation and insurance, of renewing infrastructures near the 
coast about every 20 years, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland, the weather is kinder to man-made structures but the desert sands, 
which buried a dozen ancient civilizations, have no more respect for 
20th-Century construction. 
</P>
<P>
Sand plus wind acts as a natural abrasive on buildings while the desert dunes, 
creeping inexorably forward at a rate of a few feet a year, must be constantly 
held back. Sand is not as damaging as atmospheric corrosion, but it adds to 
costs.

CONFIDENCE -- PARTLY A MATTER OF GENETICS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some people are born with the belief that they are masters of their own lives. 
Others feel that they are at the mercy of fate. 
</P>
<P>
New research shows that some of those feelings are in the genes. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists long have known that people confident in their ability to control 
their destinies are more likely to adjust well to growing old than others. 
</P>
<P>
Two researchers who questioned hundreds of Swedish twins report that such 
confidence, or lack of it, is partly genetic and partly drawn from experience. 
</P>
<P>
They also found that the belief in blind luck -- that coincidence plays a big 
role in life -- is something learned and has nothing to do with heredity. 
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted at the Karolinska Institute, which annually awards 
the Nobel Prize for medicine, by Karolinska's Nancy Pedersen and Margaret Gatz, 
a psychology professor at the University of Southern California. Their results 
recently were published in the United States in the Journal of Gerontology. 
</P>
<P>
The study of twins, who have identical or similar genes, eliminates genetics as 
the explanation of differences, said Richard J. Rose, professor of psychology 
and medical genetics at Indiana University. Variances in twins must then be 
attributed to their distinct environment and experiences. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the Gatz-Pedersen study "is consistent with other world 
literature on the subject" but has the added importance of being based on a far 
larger and more representative sample than previous research, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
"The belief in your ability to control your life direction, or the belief in 
your own competence, is 30% something you are born with," said Gatz, 
interviewed during a consultation visit to Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
People who are confident of their ability to control their lives have an 
"internal locus of control" and a better chance of being well-adjusted in old 
age, said Pedersen. 
</P>
<P>
An "external locus of control" -- believing that outside forces determine the 
course of life -- has been linked to depression in later years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the windows on the aging process," said Pedersen, who has 
published a series of studies on the genetics of personality traits based on 
interviews with twins. The study on life control involved 554 pairs of twins. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to understand what makes people different. What makes some 
people age gracefully and others have a more difficult time?" she said. 
"Whether people feel independent is an important standard for service 
institutions and how they treat the elderly." 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that while people have an inborn predilection toward 
independence and self-confidence, about 70% of this personality trait is 
affected by a person's environment and experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen's studies, with various collaborators, probe the aging process by 
comparing sets of twins, identical and fraternal, many of whom were separated 
at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects were drawn from a roster first compiled about 30 years ago 
registering all twins born in Sweden since 1886. The complete list, which was 
extended in 1971, has 95,000 sets of twins. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said the registry, based on the whole population, is "an unusually 
powerful tool." U.S. researchers have nothing comparable and normally rely on 
twins who respond to advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Karolinska professor Anders Ahlbom, who runs the registry, said 80% to 85% of 
twins typically respond to questionnaires sent by researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen said that studies of twins who were reared separately but have 
identical or nearly identical genes, compared to twins reared together, can 
yield a unique measure of nature-vs.-nurture in human development. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier research by Pedersen showed that a variety of other characteristics are 
30% to 40% determined by a person's genetic makeup, including many of those 
traits that make up what has become known as Type A behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The Type A person -- the hard-driving worker who brings home his work from the 
office, eats too fast, keeps his foot on the clutch at traffic lights and makes 
a point of being on time -- has been found to have a higher risk of heart 
disease before age 65.

CARING FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS LEAVES MANY HOSPITALS ALONG BORDER IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION

<P>
Some had their limbs severed by the wheels of a train headed north from the 
Laredo, Tex., rail yards. Others were mangled in car crashes as they tried to 
flee the Border Patrol. All were among the illegal aliens who end up in Buddy 
Flores' hospital on the Southwest border. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women from Mexico, who have heard that Mercy Regional Medical Center 
in Laredo will not turn them away, show up ready to deliver a child who will 
automatically be a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Many have had no prenatal care. Others arrive midway through a difficult or 
troubled labor that their midwife decided she could not complete. 
</P>
<P>
In a city with a large population of legal residents without insurance or money 
to pay for medical care, illegal aliens are draining resources at Flores' 
Catholic hospital and "occupying intensive care beds that are short as it is," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital writes off $20 million a year in bad debts and charity care, but 
Flores doesn't know how much is spent on undocumented aliens. Under Texas law, 
no patient can be refused emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, I would have told you this was an occasional problem 
(delivering babies from women here illegally)," Flores said. "It's a consistent 
problem now. If they're in active labor they know we can't refuse them." 
</P>
<P>
Laredo's problems are not unique: Hospitals and trauma units from San Diego to 
Miami have been experiencing financial difficulties in treating undocumented 
aliens, according to border-state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not unusual for a border-area hospital to treat a large number of 
patients who may be illegally within the U.S. Almost always the hospital must 
write off the cost of this medical care because the patient cannot pay and 
invariably has no medical insurance," said Rep. Kika de la Garza, a Texas 
Democrat whose district borders Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
De la Garza is co-sponsoring the Trauma Care Center Alien Compensation Act that 
would provide $20 million a year in grants to hospitals that incur at least 15% 
of their uncompensated costs from treating illegal aliens in their trauma 
units. 
</P>
<P>
"The legislation would recognize immigration-related problems as a federal 
responsibility not to be shouldered alone by hospital trauma centers," De la 
Garza said. "From Los Angeles to Miami, trauma centers face reimbursement 
problems that threaten trauma care for all patients." 
</P>
<P>
Co-sponsored by Rep. Bill Lowery, a San Diego Republican, the bill would apply 
only to trauma patients and would not cover the problem of illegal aliens 
delivering their babies in the United States.

Hugo L. Black had the rare privilege of speaking for the Supreme Court on March 
18, 1963, when it unanimously reversed itself and decided that he had been 
right all along. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one years earlier, Black had led a band of three dissenters as the court 
ruled that the Constitution did not require states to provide counsel for 
criminal defendants who were too poor to hire their own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Now the court was considering the case of Clarence Earl Gideon, convicted in a 
Florida court of breaking into a poolroom. He was sentenced to five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Gideon told the judge he was entitled to a lawyer. The judge and the Florida 
Supreme Court both turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
The situation, said Black, was "strikingly like" the 1942 case, in which an 
unemployed Maryland farmhand, denied a lawyer, was convicted of robbery. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the high court ruled that the appointment of counsel was not "a 
fundamental right, essential to a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
Now, with all of his colleagues on his side, Black's decision ruled that Gideon 
was indeed entitled to a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental 
and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Black's triumph was a dramatic demonstration of the power of dissent -- a power 
that often has seen the minority opinion become the majority opinion as time 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous dissents in the court's history was that of John 
Marshall Harlan in a Louisiana railroad case in 1896 that established the rule 
of "separate but equal" facilities for the races. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Constitution is colorblind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among 
citizens," Harlan said. "In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal 
before the law." 
</P>
<P>
He was the lone dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, however, the court unanimously ruled that the "separate but equal" 
doctrine was unconstitutional discrimination against black children because 
"separate education facilities are inherently unequal." 
</P>
<P>
Often, more than one justice files a dissenting opinion. In the court's 1986 
term, for example, there were 156 dissents, exactly the number of cases the 
court decided on the merits, although 41 of the court's decisions were 
unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the dissents attract little attention. In some of the more famous ones: 
</P>
<P>
* Justice Louis D. Brandeis pioneered the theory, now widely accepted, of a 
constitutional right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
* Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. warned against "attempts to check the 
expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death." 
</P>
<P>
* Justice William O. Douglas inveighed against loyalty-security hearings in 
which "faceless people are allowed to present their whispered rumors and yet 
escape the test and torture of cross-examination." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes summed up the case for the dissenters this 
way: 
</P>
<P>
"A dissent in a court of last resort is an appeal to the brooding spirit of the 
law, to the intelligence of a future day, when a later decision may possibly 
correct the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court to have 
been betrayed."

VA MUST REVAMP SYSTEM FOR AN AGING CLIENTELE

<P>
American military veterans are growing older as a group, so the Veterans 
Affairs Department is re-evaluating their system of medical care for the first 
time in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski will soon name a commission to review the 
"mission" of the system's 172 hospitals and its hundreds of outpatient clinics, 
nursing homes and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Medicine has changed greatly since 1965, but the politics of closing a hospital 
have not. In 1965, the VA barely managed to close seven of the 15 hospitals and 
old soldiers' homes it had recommended should be shut down. The emphasis has 
shifted from in-hospital care to outpatient, extended and preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
Government-sponsored medicine, as well as private care, costs more today. VA 
hospitals must compete for the federal tax dollars needed to pay doctors and 
nurses adequately and maintaining up-to-date equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress say that for the last 10 years, the VA system has had 
insufficient financial support, and that it needs $250 million more this year 
just to run a bare-bones operation through September. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski's proposal for the next fiscal year is a record $31 billion for 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of care rises with the age of the patient. And the main point that 
Derwinski has driven home, in one congressional hearing after another, is that 
the veteran population is aging. 
</P>
<P>
More than a third of the nation's 27.1 million veterans served during World War 
II; their average age is now 68. The number of veterans 65 or older is expected 
to peak, at 9 million, in 1999, according to the VA. 
</P>
<P>
The number of veterans 75 and older will rise to 2.6 million in 1995 from 1.4 
million today, and will reach 4.4 million by 2010, the VA says. 
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2010, veterans 65 and older will comprise 40% of the eligible 
veteran population, as compared to 26% in 1989," Derwinski recently told the 
Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
By that year, he said, 35% of VA hospital patients will be at least 75 and 60% 
of them will be older than 65. 
</P>
<P>
"Major adjustments" to the VA system may be needed to meet these veterans' 
needs, Derwinski said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the rest of the population, some retired veterans are moving from homes in 
the Northeast and Midwest, where many of the older VA facilities are, to 
Arizona, Florida and other states of mild climate. The VA has not kept up with 
this population shift. 
</P>
<P>
With those trends in mind, the VA Commission on the Future Structure of 
Veterans Health Care is to begin meeting in May and come up with a set of 
recommendations by October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski has already promised that no facility will be closed, even though 
some cities, such as Chicago, may have three hospitals with overlapping 
services. 
</P>
<P>
VA facilities, like dams and highways, are prime cuts of political pork. 
Congressmen gave Derwinski a cool reception last summer when he proposed 
legislation to have them choose the commission members, preferring to keep 
their distance from a group that could recommend closing facilities in their 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Congress was still up in arms over another panel's recommendation that domestic 
military bases be shut down, so Derwinski decided to appoint his own 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
What the VA can do is convert a hospital to another use, such as nursing care, 
and have only one hospital per population center offering expensive, 
specialized equipment or surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Still, members of Congress and other groups are wary of the VA in light of past 
budget-cutting, when the agency was dominated by the Office of Management and 
Budget. Also, there are questions as to how independent the commission will be, 
especially since its support staff will be drawn from within the VA. 
</P>
<P>
"All too often in the past, when there was talk of re-examining the VA's 
mission, reducing services was the hidden agenda," James N. Magill of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars recently testified. 
</P>
<P>
There is a major reason for leaving some slack in the system, one that few like 
to think about: Another war or large-scale armed conflict could expand the 
veteran population. 
</P>
<P>
"If the work of the commission will be undertaken with the assumption there 
will not be a new generation of wartime veterans by the year 2000, then the 
final report of the commission may not be totally germane by the beginning of 
the next century," John F. Sommer of the American Legion said in recent 
testimony.

Bruce R. Barnson is an ample, suspender-wearing educator with unfashionably 
long sideburns and a beguiling belief that politics is too important to be left 
to adults. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a decade, the elementary school principal has urged his 11- and 
12-year-old charges to get down and dirty in state politics. Come up with an 
idea to benefit the commonweal, Barnson tells them, then lobby relentlessly to 
ram it through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Through cunning, manipulation of the media, moral righteousness and 
old-fashioned political muscle, the students have assembled a record that would 
be the envy of any Capitol Hill power broker: Among other triumphs, they have 
pushed through a mandatory seat-belt law and a resolution opposing nuclear 
waste dumping in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the children's crusade is going national by asking Congress to 
extend Daylight Saving Time another week to give trick-or-treaters an extra 
hour of light on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Empowerment of the young comes easily in Utah, which is the most youthful state 
in the Union thanks to a Mormon zeal for big families. One-third of the state's 
1.7 million people are under 15; the median age in Utah is 26, compared to 32 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
As the state's 1990 "Statistical Abstract" notes, "Utah's young population has 
placed unprecedented demands on the state's public education system during the 
last decade." Utah has the nation's most crowded classrooms, with a 
student-teacher ratio of 25.4 to 1; teachers earn less than their counterparts 
in 43 other states, and Utah ranks 50th in average annual expenditure per 
student. 
</P>
<P>
For Barnson, who was named Utah's most distinguished elementary principal two 
years ago, all those youngsters are not so much a problem as an opportunity. 
After growing up on a farm in southern Utah, Barnson dropped out of college, 
did a stint in the Army, then labored in an open-pit copper mine in Nevada. 
Working the graveyard shift one night, he had a revelation -- that "only 
coyotes and prostitutes work these kinds of hours" -- and returned to school to 
eventually earn a doctorate in education from Brigham Young University. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, three years after Barnson became principal at Ridgecrest Elementary 
School, his fifth-graders launched their first, modest "legislative project." 
Utah, they realized, had a state motto, "Industry"; a state bird, the sea gull; 
a state song, "Utah, We Love Thee"; even a state fish, the rainbow trout. One 
thing it didn't have was a state bug. In the Beehive State, the leading 
candidate was somewhat self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with statistics about the honey industry and the bee's value to 
agriculture, a dozen pint-sized lobbyists worked over the state Senate's Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee. As a school scrapbook later put it, "They also 
learned to deal with opposition and some ridicule." But when then-Gov. Scott 
Matheson signed SB216 into law, he called it "the bright spot of the session." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the students returned to the Statehouse with a weightier issue; 
in a meeting with Matheson, they noted that Utah was one of only nine states 
with no "child safety restraint" law. The governor, having twice failed to pass 
seat-belt legislation, urged the children to "march right upstairs to the 
Legislature" and press the issue. 
</P>
<P>
They did that and more -- manning observation posts near the school to count 
how many auto occupants were wearing seat belts, raising $20,000 for a "buckle 
up" billboard campaign, and sending educational packets to other schools. Over 
bitter opposition from state senators, who warned darkly about trampling 
"parents' rights," a bill requiring mandatory belting for children under age 5 
passed the Senate 21 to 5 and eventually became law. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear waste came next. Noting that geologists had identified a subterranean 
salt dome in one of Utah's national parks potentially suitable for a temporary 
storage site for radioactive matter, Barnson's students conducted a public 
opinion poll on the issue in Salt Lake County. Not surprisingly -- nuclear 
waste is about as popular here as a contagious skin disease -- 85% of the 
respondents opposed the idea. The Legislature passed, and the governor signed, 
a resolution reflecting that sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Such exercises, the school scrapbook declares, "foster patriotism, free 
enterprise and involved citizenship," while suggesting "the value of individual 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
Students also learn a little bare-knuckled politics, as demonstrated in their 
most recent enterprise: placing the statue of a famous Utahn in the U.S. 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
More than a century ago, Congress authorized each state to erect statues of two 
native sons -- or daughters -- in the hallowed halls. In 1950, Utah's Brigham 
Young joined the pantheon; four years ago, students at Ridgecrest concluded 
that the time had come to fill the second niche. They drafted a list of 21 
significant figures in Utah's history and asked 27 elementary schools around 
the state to list their favorites; a slightly smaller list was sent to 501 
homes here in Sandy, and the students conducted an informal survey at a 
downtown mall. 
</P>
<P>
The clear favorite was one Philo T. Farnsworth, an inventor who is considered 
the father of television. A bill supporting Farnsworth's immortalization passed 
the Utah House and cleared a Senate committee, but trouble appeared from an 
unexpected quarter: Advocates of hotel magnate J. Willard Marriott, a native 
son from northern Utah, outmaneuvered the children by tabling and eventually 
killing the Farnsworth bill. 
</P>
<P>
In the '87-'88 school year, Barnson's students tried again, only to see history 
begin to repeat itself. A Farnsworth bill cleared committees in both chambers, 
but the Marriott forces, who wanted their own man in Washington, bottled up 
Farnsworth in the Senate Rules Committee. It was time for hardball. As the 
school scrapbook recounted, "The committee finally let it out when, at our 
request, the TV stations asked why our bill was being held." After some more 
skin-of-the-teeth maneuvering, the bill finally became law, and a statue of 
Philo T. Farnsworth will soon appear in the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Barnson, who moved to Silver Mesa Elementary School this year, is slightly 
pessimistic about congressional willingness to extend daylight saving time, 
although the Utah Legislature supports the idea. The junior lobbyists are 
trying to compile statistics on the number of children killed by automobiles at 
dusk on Halloween, but that has been a difficult task. Persuading the lawmakers 
on Capitol Hill to tinker with the national clock also seems a bit daunting. 
"Our only ally is reason," Barnson sighed, "and I'm not sure reason works in 
smoke-filled rooms."

'WEEKEND WARRIORS' ROUND UP FUN, BRUISES AT CONEJO VALLEY RODEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Boyle describes himself as a "weekend warrior." But rather than playing a 
hard game of basketball or football in his spare time, the 32-year-old Simi 
Valley resident likes to rope calves. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at the annual Conejo Valley Days rodeo, Boyle and his brother Mike, 
in front of about 2,500 spectators, galloped full-tilt into the arena after a 
calf that was doing its best to avoid their lariats. 
</P>
<P>
They lassoed it in 9.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"That isn't a good time for us, but it's a respectable time for this area," 
Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle and his brother grew up on a Simi Valley ranch and although horses have 
been a way of life for both of them, they didn't begin competing on the rodeo 
circuit until about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't afford it, don't do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle added that if the Conejo Valley Days rodeo wasn't close to home, he and 
his brother would not bother to come each year because the prize money isn't 
very big. 
</P>
<P>
The top four winners in each of the seven events at the rodeo are rewarded, 
"but they don't have good money," Boyle said. He and his brother expect to take 
home about $400. 
</P>
<P>
Top rodeo riders who compete full time in bareback riding, steer wrestling, 
bull riding and calf roping can make about $100,000, Boyle said. But most rodeo 
competitors have regular jobs and are "weekend warriors" who perform only in 
area rodeos, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle owns a welding shop in Simi 
</P>
<P>
Valley and his brother is a wrangler who takes care of horses for movie 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
While a professional rodeo competitor may hit 150 rodeos annually, Boyle has 
gone to only 17 rodeos in the past two years. Expenses such as entry fees, 
horse equipment and transportation add up, and several hundred dollars can be 
spent on just one weekend rodeo, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the financial demands that have increased over the years for 
rodeo riders, the competitiveness has also intensified, said Ron Warne, who has 
more than 30 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
Warne, a 48-year-old Moorpark resident, competed Saturday against Boyle and his 
brother in the team-roping competition. Warne and his partner, Billy 
Washington, lassoed their calf in 9.2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got it down to a real science. It used to be that cowboys would tie a 
calf in 15 to 20 seconds. Now they can do it in 7 or 8 seconds," Warne said. 
</P>
<P>
Warne, who owns a horse transportation business and who does part-time coaching 
of his own, attributed the change to better training. "They've got the 
opportunity to learn these skills at a younger age than the older generation." 
</P>
<P>
Like many rodeo competitors, Warne was exposed to horses at an early age. His 
family owned a ranch in Northern California, and when he started riding in 
rodeos at 16, that was not unusual among his peers. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years he has broken several ribs and has had to have some knee 
operations. From 16 to 35, Warne rode "rough stock," meaning bulls and 
bareback. At 35, when he was beginning to "slow down," Warne decided to confine 
himself to calf roping and team roping. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Boyles, Warne has been coming to the Conejo Valley Days rodeo for many 
years. According to Warne, the Thousand Oaks rodeo is unusual for its large and 
enthusiastic crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"They always have a spectacular crowd at every performance. At some rodeos 
there isn't that big a crowd. Here they really get into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Warne's partner, 32-year-old Moorpark resident Billy Washington, began 
competing on the rodeo circuit about five years ago. Before that, he competed 
full time in karate tournaments, ranking in the top 10 in the U.S. for 
full-contact and point karate. Like the others, he is a weekend cowboy who 
works full time as a bodyguard in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Patting his horse "Gold Dust," before his event, Washington explained that in 
calf roping, the horse does 70% to 80% of the work. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to depend on him to do everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington advised those interested in joining the rodeo circuit to find 
excellent instructors to avoid learning bad habits. When he was starting out 
and inexperienced, he cut a finger off while competing in team roping, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal for him is the competition and the atmosphere. "It kind of takes you 
back in time," Washington said. "I'll probably stay in it until I get old or 
break a bone or something." 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley Days rodeo rounds up today, with shows at 1 and 4 p.m. Events 
are bareback riding, steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, team roping, women's 
barrel racing, bull riding and calf roping.

3 STEAL JEWELRY WORTH $100,000 
</P>

In one of the biggest jewelry robberies in Ventura County history, more than 
$100,000 in jewels was stolen at gunpoint from a Thousand Oaks department store 
Friday night, authorities disclosed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The jewelry was taken from the Best Products store in the Janss Mall by three 
robbers, one of whom confronted a jewelry department clerk with a black, 
semiautomatic handgun, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman ordered the clerk to unlock the eight jewelry cases. While his two 
accomplices were emptying the cases, the gunman detained eight clerks and 
customers who were in the area, a sheriff's official added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the largest jewel robberies we've had," Sheriff's Lt. Tony 
Ditzhazy said. "It wasn't like holding up a 7-Eleven or gas station. They came 
in full well knowing what they were going to do." 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a major case. . . . I don't recall a larger one, but that 
doesn't mean there hasn't been one. I just don't recall a single larger one in 
Thousand Oaks," Undersheriff Larry Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers took "everything in the store," Ditzhazy said. He said one witness 
described a possible getaway vehicle as being a gold or gray Hyundai-type car 
with California license plates. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was described as 28 to 30 years old, 6 feet 3 inches tall and black, 
with short hair. The two other men were described as black, shorter than the 
gunman and under 20 years old, Ditzhazy said.

SAILOR PRESUMED DEAD AFTER 2 DAYS LOST AT SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard canceled a search for a missing Ventura sailor Saturday 
afternoon, concluding after 40 hours that the man probably did not survive two 
nights in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
David Dufau, 37, an experienced sailor who taught elementary school in Ojai, is 
missing and presumed dead, Coast Guard officials said. A fisherman found 
Dufau's catamaran Euphoria capsized 2 1/2 miles northeast of Anacapa Island on 
Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Dufau's wife, Mary Lynch, reported her husband missing at about midnight 
Thursday when he failed to return from a two-hour trip to the island. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and National Park Service searched more than 900 square 
miles of ocean, 60 miles of the California coast and Anacapa's beaches before 
ending the search at 3:32 p.m. Saturday, said Petty Officer Robert Beals. 
</P>
<P>
The search was ended "based on a negligible chance that the man could be 
located alive," Beals said. Even under "optimum conditions," no one would last 
much more than 40 hours in the 62-degree water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, the Ventura Harbor staff found Dufau's blue Toyota and empty 
boat trailer in the harbor parking lot, said Deputy Harbormaster Leigh Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Dufau sometimes taught sailing classes for the city of Ventura, said city 
sailing instructor Leo Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
"I always respected his sailing ability," Robbins said. "Of all the people for 
this to happen to, I would least expect it to happen to him. When I saw him 
sailing that boat, the boat performed very well, and he was in good control of 
it, going real fast and having fun -- and he liked to go fast." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins remembered a homemade yawl which Dufau sailed while he was in college 
-- a single-masted boat fitted with a second mast and three sails. 
</P>
<P>
"He sailed that funny-looking boat all over the harbor, and everybody laughed, 
but that thing really went," Robbins recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The Euphoria was an 18-foot P-Cat, a 10- or 15-year-old fiberglass catamaran 
which Dufau had fitted with taller rigging and a better sail, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Coast Guard investigators examined the boat on the beach outside 
their station in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The mast lay broken on the crossbeam, having snapped while the boat was being 
righted in the water. Two rugby shirts lay stretched on the deck, one 
emblazoned with a bright-red V and a rugby ball. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Jeff Olsen said investigators found the tiller broken away from 
the rudder and pieces of thin plastic twine that might have been tied on to 
hold them together. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen said investigators could not tell whether the steering system had been 
lashed together in an emergency or if the twine was merely used to fasten 
something else to the tiller. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I gather, he seems to have been a pretty experienced sailor, so he's 
certainly capable of jury-rigging a repair, and he's certainly capable of 
throwing a water jug over the side and tying it off to keep it cool," Olsen 
said. "It may not be anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
Beals said the search will remain suspended unless someone spots any more clues 
to Dufau's disappearance.

CHUMASH TO SUGGEST NAME FOR WILDERNESS; 
</P>
<P>
INDIANS: AN ESTIMATED 200 TRIBE MEMBERS WILL VOTE TONIGHT. ORGANIZERS SAY THE 
MEETING MIGHT HELP FOSTER MORE SELF-AWARENESS AND UNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In what is predicted to be the tribe's largest gathering in memory, the Chumash 
Indians are scheduled to meet tonight to recommend a Chumash name for a 
proposed national wilderness area in northern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's been a gathering like this ever," said Patrick Tumamait 
of Ojai, a Chumash who helped organize the meeting. He said 250 flyers have 
been sent to Chumash Indians and to people and organizations active in other 
tribes, and he said more than 200 members of the tribe are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
The wilderness proposal is stalled in Congress, so a decision on what to name 
the area may be of little consequence. But Tumamait and others active in Indian 
affairs say that just having such a meeting may foster more self-awareness and 
unity among the Chumash people. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we are trying to do," said Connie Diaz of Oxnard, who said she 
has spread the word about the meeting to fellow Chumash. "We should all band 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's hard to get a lot of Indian people out, really," she added. "Years 
ago, many people who were Indian didn't want to be Indian. They wanted to be 
Mexican or whatever other nationality they were mixed with. So much had 
happened to the Indian people." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 Chumash inhabited Ventura, Santa Barbara and San 
Luis Obispo counties as far inland as Bakersfield when Spanish explorers 
arrived in the 18th Century. European diseases decimated the Chumash, and many 
who survived were forced to abandon their culture. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 200 Chumash live on a reservation in Santa Ynez, about 20 miles 
north of Santa Barbara, and an estimated 3,000 others of Chumash descent are 
scattered throughout Southern California, about 1,000 in Ventura County. 
Several Chumash from the reservation plan to attend the meeting Sunday, 
according to Tony Romero, a Chumash spokesman there. 
</P>
<P>
Tumamait and others involved in Indian affairs say the Chumash are not 
organized, and, until recently, most people thought of them only when a 
developer uncovered a Chumash burial site. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chumash as a live culture have only gotten attention in the past few 
years," Tumamait said. Sunday's meeting "would add to that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Stenslie, deputy director of the Candelaria American Indian Council, an 
Oxnard-based agency that operates a number of Indian programs, sees another 
benefit to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"What's nice about this is, it should be an opportunity for the Chumash to 
rally around something that's not divisive, not controversial," Stenslie said. 
</P>
<P>
Disputes have arisen over the use of Chumash Indians as monitors when 
developers or government contractors disturb Chumash archeological sites. The 
monitors, who earn as much as $20 an hour, are supposed to make sure that human 
remains, among other things, are handled properly. 
</P>
<P>
Some Chumash have charged that non-Indians who claim to be Chumash have 
received many of the lucrative jobs, that even many Chumash monitors are 
untrained, and that monitors occasionally have let developers cut corners at 
sacred sites. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's meeting, anyone who claims to be a Chumash will be allowed to vote, 
said Robert Peterson, an organizer of the meeting who also is a director of the 
Ventura-based Native American Indian Inter-Tribal Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Only Chumash will vote on the proposed names, Tumamait and Peterson said, but 
members of any tribe, and even non-Indians, are welcome at the meeting, which 
is scheduled to start at 6:30 p.m. at the inter-tribal association's 
headquarters at Washington School, 96 South MacMillan Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Tumamait and Peterson helped set up the meeting after the Sierra Club asked for 
a Chumash recommendation on what to call the proposed wilderness area. Under 
legislation that has passed the House of Representatives and is pending in the 
Senate, a 378,000-acre expanse of the Los Padres National Forest would be 
protected as a wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
Sally M. Reid, a national director of the Sierra Club, said the environmental 
group wanted a Chumash name because the Hispanic name now proposed -- the San 
Aemigdio Mesa Wilderness Area, after a prominent topographical feature -- 
seemed inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important area to the Chumash Indians," Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
Tumamait agreed. "There are burial sites, village sites, lots of rock paintings 
in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), who sponsored the wilderness bill, told 
Reid to make sure that the Chumash were involved in selecting a name. Reid met 
with Tumamait and other Chumash leaders in early March, and Tumamait 
volunteered to come back Sunday with possible names. 
</P>
<P>
He said suggestions came from his father, Vincent Tumamait, a respected Chumash 
elder who is active in education programs about the tribe and has one of the 
few reference works that list some Chumash words and their meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Tumamait said four names will be put to a vote on Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
* Chumash Wilderness Area: Chumash means "island people," and the term reflects 
the fact that some members of the tribe were found on the Channel Islands. 
Patrick Tumamait said one drawback to that name is that the wilderness is 
inland, and nowhere near the islands. But he favors that name because it would 
increase the tribe's visibility. 
</P>
<P>
* Kasi-Wey Wilderness Area. Kasi-wey means "the pass" in Chumash, and that name 
would recognize the migration of Chumash through the mountains as they settled 
the coastal area, Tumamait said. 
</P>
<P>
* Kaspot-Kaslo (Eagle's Nest) Wilderness Area. 
</P>
<P>
* Wit Wilderness Area. Wit means "condor" in Chumash, and Tumamait said his 
father prefers that name because condors once soared over the area. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said he does not expect any difficulty getting Congress to approve 
whatever name the Chumash select. The problem, he said, is getting a wilderness 
bill passed at all. 
</P>
<P>
The House has approved his bill, but it is stalled in the Senate, where Sen. 
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., has introduced a rival measure. Although Cranston's 
bill also would create a new wilderness area, it would provide more protection 
to Sespe Creek and would restrict the use of private land. That fact has drawn 
opposition from Lagomarsino and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I were optimistic," Lagomarsino said.

ANTI-GANG PROGRAM CUT CRIME BUT MAY BE LOSING ITS STING; 
</P>
<P>
HARBOR CITY: LONGER TERMS AND POLICE WARNINGS SLASHED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY 47%. A 
RECENT RESURGENCE INDICATES STRONGER ACTION MAY BE NEEDED.

<P>
Gang-related crime in Harbor City fell by almost half from 1988 to 1989, and 
police attribute the drop largely to an innovative program designed to curb 
gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
But as crime inches back up, there are signs that the program -- with its 
longer jail sentences for gang-related crime and warnings that gang members can 
do time for such things as wearing a beeper -- is losing its punch. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Division police say the two-step program has reduced gang crime -- 
including assault, murder and robbery -- by 47% in the South Bay community 
since it began. Under the first step, based on a 1988 state law and implemented 
last July, police created extensive files on known violent street gangs, and 
had members sign forms acknowledging their affiliation. That law also provides 
for additional jail time for convicted gang criminals. 
</P>
<P>
In the second step, which began last fall, gang members learned of a more 
drastic consequence. Police posted warnings telling gang members that the city 
attorney would seek a court order permitting police to arrest gang members for 
engaging in a number of otherwise legal activities, including such things as 
carrying a pager or flashing gang signs. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of those moves was to scare gang members, but the impact may be 
wearing off. Without getting an injunction, police are unable to arrest gang 
members for otherwise innocent activities, Harbor Division Capt. Joseph De 
Ladurantey said. Officials are watching the recent small increase in gang crime 
and are discussing filing for the court order. 
</P>
<P>
"We will seek to use the injunction if we think it is needed. The notice may be 
sufficient, and we might take other steps first," De Ladurantey said. "But we 
will certainly look at (the court order) if gang crime is not kept at an 
acceptable level. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty dramatic," he said. "It means for flashing a gang sign or wearing 
a beeper, you could get a year in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Such court orders are obtained under city ordinances that bar nuisance 
activities, such as prostitution at a massage parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighborhood activists say they would welcome the injunction, while civil 
liberties activists say the prospect is a nightmare for the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Salsman, past president of the Palo Del Amo Woods Homeowner's Assn., 
endorsed the idea. "Without the injunction step, it has really been just an 
exercise. I am very enthusiastic about the program and would like to see it 
carried to the next step," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ramona Ripston, executive director of the Southern California American 
Civil Liberties Union affiliate, said: "It is clearly unconstitutional. It's 
just another example of politicians pandering to the public trying to make them 
believe that they are coming up with solutions to gangs (and) drugs. But it is 
not going to solve the problem, and in the process, we may lose our civil 
liberties." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Bruce Coplen emphasized that not all of the prohibitions in 
the notice would necessarily be approved by a judge, but he said some 
circumstances justify a limit on civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
The legal theory for such limits has already been sustained in other cases, he 
said. An injunction against a West Los Angeles gang in 1987 -- obtained under a 
city ordinance -- contained many of the Harbor City prohibitions, Coplen said, 
and gang crime dropped off drastically after several cases were successfully 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a right to be safe and able to walk the street," said Coplen, 
supervisor of the city's gang prosecution program. "If someone is terrorizing 
you, you have the right to get a court order to demand to stop those 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
The state law's provision for enhanced penalties, which allows an additional 
three years on a felony sentence and one year on a misdemeanor, means that a 
gang member could potentially serve significant jail time for breaking the 
court order, said Coplen. 
</P>
<P>
To police, that is fine. "It is saying, 'You no longer exist as a gang.' It 
says if you are a gang member, you lose your civil rights," Detective Mike 
Markulis said.. 
</P>
<P>
De Ladurantey is cautious, however, about rushing to get a court order now. It 
would be tantamount to admitting defeat of the program, he said, adding that he 
would "like to think the kids will realize what this would mean, and do a 
little self-enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Harbor City community worry that the most recent small rise 
in crime -- which does not bring gang crime near the levels of 1988 -- may mean 
that gangs are starting to call the Police Department's bluff. 
</P>
<P>
EXCERPT FROM NOTICE TO GANG MEMBERS 
</P>
<P>
The notice to gang members reads, in part: 
</P>
<P>

'BOOTLEG' UNITS: BLESSING OR BLIGHT?;

Dennis Cassity's beach house is a modest place, really. OK, so it's a garage. 
</P>
<P>
But such a cozy garage! Tiled bathroom, kitchenette, wall-to-wall carpeting, a 
patio with an ocean view, only steps from the sand, on one of the better 
streets in Hermosa Beach -- all for about $100 a month less than the cheapest 
one-bedroom in town. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I knew it was illegal!" the 40-year-old computer repairman said 
with a laugh, recalling when he moved in 4 1/2 years ago. "I was born and 
raised on the beach. I know a bootleg (apartment) when I see one. But I was 
going through a divorce and, well, you throw in two ex-wives and child support 
-- I just wanted something I could afford." 
</P>
<P>
So Cassity settled for a rental on the beach side of Hermosa Avenue and the 
wrong side of the law. And though he has been comfortable there, he was not 
surprised last month when he learned his apartment had been built without a 
permit in a place where apartments are not allowed. His landlord gave him the 
word last week, he said -- he has to be out by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the underground of the Southern California real estate market, where 
one man's misdemeanor is another man's home. No one knows exactly how many 
"illegal dwelling units" there are in the Los Angeles area, but planning and 
building authorities say they have become an irksome fixture in garages and 
spare rooms throughout the region and a particularly troublesome problem in the 
beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hate them for the crowding and safety hazards they cause, 
claiming they make a mockery of zoning laws. Renters, on the other hand, say 
they are one of the few sources of affordable housing for young adults, single 
parents, the elderly and the poor in densely packed and high-priced 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan Beach, where a one-bedroom apartment rents for $750 a month or 
more, about 100 bootleg complaints a year are filed with the city's residential 
zoning inspector. Culver City, on the cramped Westside, launched a crackdown in 
March. Redondo Beach, which logs about five bootleg complaints a month, last 
year caught a landlord on the city's north side who had lined his wine cellar 
with bunk beds and rented it out to 16 Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Illegal units have been a problem for as long as I've been here, and that's 
been since 1978," said William Grove, director of building and safety for 
Hermosa Beach. "At any one time, we've got a solid core of 25 to 30 cases." 
</P>
<P>
Every few years, he said, the city launches a new enforcement campaign, but the 
problem always seems to return. The most recent get-tough effort involved 
hiring a special prosecutor in November to concentrate on enforcing the city's 
anti-bootleg laws. 
</P>
<P>
The first of those special prosecutions is scheduled to go to trial May 9 -- 
against Cassity's landlord, Edward W. Roszyk of Redondo Beach. Besides 
Cassity's cheery bachelor apartment, Roszyk is accused of having added at least 
two other illegal units to single-family homes he owns, one taking up 120 
square feet at the back of a Manhattan Avenue garage, and the other in the 
garage of a shingled cottage down the street from Cassity's place. 
</P>
<P>
The units have prompted city prosecutors to charge Roszyk with a dozen 
misdemeanor violations of the Uniform Building Code, the Uniform Plumbing Code 
and the Municipal Code. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon last week, Roszyk tacked up hand-lettered FOR SALE signs on two 
of the three properties named in his case. On one of the properties, a handyman 
dismantled what court records say had been a garage apartment with an extremely 
low-slung loft bed. 
</P>
<P>
Roszyk declined to comment on the charges. But interviews with the city's 
prosecutor and court records indicate he is taking steps to cooperate with the 
city. If he complies, the city may drop the charges. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to an affidavit by city building inspector F. Paul Conreal, 
Roszyk has been reluctant in the past. He was offered the chance last summer to 
voluntarily shut down his bootlegs, and "his response was that he would not do 
anything (to comply) because he felt there was selective enforcement . . . and 
he was being singled out and harassed." 
</P>
<P>
Roszyk's tenants -- and other supporters of bootlegs in the beach cities -- say 
he has a point. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the landlord was that much in the wrong," said 24-year-old Jeff 
Gunn, who said he paid Roszyk $400 a month for one of five units in what was 
supposed to be a single-family home with a garage. 
</P>
<P>
"There's garage conversions everywhere -- everyone wants to live by the beach." 
</P>
<P>
A Manhattan Beach renter, who spoke on condition that her name be withheld, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have a lot of little houses for people than these big, giant houses 
they're putting up in Manhattan Beach that I'll never be able to afford unless 
I win the lottery," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
She does not live in a bootleg herself, she added, but she shares a house in 
which one bedroom has illegally been converted to a bachelor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"If my landlord can cheat and, in turn, save me money, I'm not going to tell on 
him," she said, adding that as a resident, she is far more offended by the 
trend toward tearing down little beach cottages and erecting two- and 
three-story mansions in their place. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to talk about codes," she said, "let's talk about these people who 
block everybody's view with 5,300-square-foot homes in tiny little love shack 
zones." 
</P>
<P>
But there's another side of the argument: the side, for example, of the people 
who live next door to illegal apartments. Consider the observations of Roy A. 
Judd, who lives next door to the Roszyk property where Gunn lived. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Roszyk) is getting $2,600 a month total income off what's supposed to be 
one single-family dwelling," Judd said. "But there are six people living there 
with no legal parking places, and so there are six times the cars, six times 
the trash and six times the people going in and out at all hours of the night." 
</P>
<P>
For the first few months after Roszyk remodeled the house next door to Judd's 
in 1984, Judd said he didn't complain because the tenants there were friendly 
and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"But then they moved out and he rented it to a bunch of party animals who 
seemed to live in split shifts," Judd said. "There were 24-hour-a-day parties. 
Twenty people in the hot tub at 2 and 3 in the morning. . . . Finally enough 
was enough. The neighbors declared war." 
</P>
<P>
Judd fired off a flurry of letters to City Hall. Other neighbors followed suit. 
At one point, he said, about 15 people marched over to the city manager's 
office to complain about the bootleg and the noise. 
</P>
<P>
Such feuds, city officials say, are the most fruitful source of tips about 
illegal apartments. In Roszyk's case, it was the complaints of his angry 
neighbors that prompted the city not only to crack down on him, but finally to 
hire the special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
And the battles can be bitter. In 1988, for example, the annexation of the 
unincorporated Orange County community of South Laguna to Laguna Beach left the 
city with 119 new complaints about bootlegs. When the city launched an effort 
to phase the units into compliance, the result was an all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
A recall campaign was launched, and city officials soon found that their own 
building records were being probed. The community development director got 
caught with an illegal addition. A city councilman was nabbed with an improper 
den off his garage. But most dramatic was the case of building inspector John 
Hingula, who ended up suffering an anxiety attack and quitting his 10-year job 
because the pro-bootleggers revealed that his mother-in-law had a bootleg and 
the inspector hadn't cited her. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the complaint arose, Hingula had it corrected, city officials said. 
But the incident "became political," Hingula told The Times afterward. When he 
passed out at work on the day after he removed the stove and opened up the wall 
that had turned his mother-in-law's house into a duplex, he decided to quit his 
job, he said. Former co-workers at Laguna Beach City Hall said he has since 
moved with his family to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with bootlegs, city officials say, is that they are rarely built in 
compliance with fire and other safety codes, and so can be hazardous for the 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw one guy try to rent out what he called a 'single' that consisted of a 
six-foot-high basement area that was 60 square feet, with the appliances 
plugged in next to the water heater for the main house," said Mike Magdaleno, 
senior code enforcement officer for Redondo Beach. "The appliances were a hot 
plate and a microwave, and the ceiling was so low that you bumped your head 
every time you walked up the stairs." 
</P>
<P>
Often, Magdaleno and others say, the inhabitants of such places are elderly 
people. In those cases, city officials say the best they can do is to bend the 
rules to give the landlord and tenant extra time, so the tenant can find a new 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a very sensitive and delicate social issue," added Kyle Butterwick, 
community development director for Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Only rarely do bootleg cases reach the point of criminal prosecution. Most of 
the time, just the threat is enough to prompt a landlord to dismantle the unit 
and evict the tenant, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"But then the property changes hands," said Manhattan Beach zoning inspector 
Bee Wilkening, "and another quote-unquote 'creative' owner thinks that maybe 
something can be done with the property. 
</P>
<P>
"And wouldn't you know it," said Wilkening, laughing, "the complaints you got 
before start coming around again."

VIETNAM VETERANS' CHILDREN SHARE IN AGENT ORANGE CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bright-eyed 9-year-old Tanya Bills laughed and jumped so much that her mother 
had to shush her. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-year-old Winona Bartley crooned softly to herself. 
</P>
<P>
And Ireana Price, 12, waited quietly with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
The three children -- all with serious medical problems -- were at the 
Inglewood-based Children of Vietnam Veterans Assistance Program on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
They are clients of the first agency in Los Angeles County to receive a grant 
from the multimillion-dollar settlement of a historic class-action lawsuit on 
the effects of Agent Orange on Vietnam veterans and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Los Angeles County has the largest number of Vietnam veterans of 
any county in the country, Dennis K. Rhoades, executive director of the private 
Agent Orange Class Assistance Program, said he expects to be awarding more 
grants in the Los Angeles area shortly. He was here last week from Washington 
to inspect the Inglewood program, which received $147,000. 
</P>
<P>
The grant program stems from a 1984 settlement of the lawsuit, which veterans 
won against seven chemical manufacturers after claiming that exposure to the 
defoliant in Vietnam resulted in medical problems for themselves and genetic 
defects in their children. 
</P>
<P>
Legal entanglements, including appeals, tied up the $240-million settlement. 
Only within the last two years have cash awards been paid to veterans. Besides 
those awards, 50 grants totaling $7.3 million from a $52-million fund were 
handed out to aid assistance programs for the veterans and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Other grants have gone to organizations aiding homeless veterans and a national 
hot line for developmental disabilities used by the Inglewood agency for 
referrals and information. 
</P>
<P>
The hot line number is (800) 922-9234 Ext. 401. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, the $147,000 grant will enable the Children of Vietnam Veterans 
Assistance Program, which now serves 60 children, to expand so that some of the 
29 on the waiting list can be included. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which is run out of the Church of Religious Science in the 500 
block of North Market Street, provides evaluation, referral and counseling 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Most significantly, there is no requirement that a veteran's child's problems 
be traced to Agent Orange exposure of the father. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of the three children who had come Friday were hoping for help, 
although none of the children's problems have been conclusively linked to Agent 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The most disabled of the children was Winona Bartley, whose mother, Winona 
Stephenson, said her daughter is severely retarded, unable to walk or talk, and 
suffers from seizures and cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her problems, a smile crossed the child's face at times. Her mother 
said Winona enjoys watching Sesame Street and entertainer Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"Her teacher told me she is the first child in a wheelchair she has seen who 
shakes her head and pops her fingers in time to the music," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Winona's father, Ben Bartley, served in Vietnam in 1970. A neighbor put the 
family in touch with the assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
Ireana Price, who lives in southwest Los Angeles, has suffered intense stomach 
spasms, eczema, wheezing, and blood in her urine and feces. Her father was a 
Marine who spent 13 months in Vietnam during some of the worst fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Bills, a fourth-grader at Anza Elementary School in Torrance, was born 
with her left leg shorter than the right and has endured surgery and months of 
a stretching process to lengthen the leg. She has no mental complications. 
</P>
<P>
"It was going to be half the length of the other leg," her mother, Roxanne, 
said. The stretching added "about three inches in the last procedure," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The child's father, Michael Bills, a longshoreman who served near Danang in 
1969 and 1970, said he suffered memory loss after returning from Vietnam. He 
said he filed a claim, joining the Agent Orange lawsuit after his daughter was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether any of their other children had genetic problems, Tanya 
interrupted to say her 14-year-old brother Christopher had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"What's his problem," her alarmed mother asked. 
</P>
<P>
"He hits me," the girl replied, giggling. "He doesn't share his candy that he 
buys, either."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
</P>
<P>
LOW-FLUSH TOILET MODELS ARE DISPLAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In parched Ventura County, it just may be that the ultra-low flush toilet, 
which uses 1.6 gallons or less of water per flush, has replaced real estate as 
the favorite topic of cocktail-party conversation. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent forum sponsored by the Ventura County Water Conservation Program, 
Etablissements Porcher, a French manufacturer, even introduced an ultra-low 
flush toilet for the status-minded. 
</P>
<P>
Called the Veneto, the unit "flushes efficiently on only 1 1/2 gallons" and 
"can save a family of four 25,000 gallons of water a year," according to the 
company's sales brochure. 
</P>
<P>
A Veneto model on display came in coraline, a salmon-like hue, and had 
gold-plated brass fittings. 
</P>
<P>
The price: $1,000, plus installation. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 18 models of water-stingy toilets, ranging in retail price from about 
$100 upward, were on display in the Camarillo Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers all claimed that the units will satisfy the Ventura city 
rationing law that requires residents to install ultra-low flush toilets and 
other water-saving devices before they can apply for increased allotments. 
Above-average-size families and homes with toilets using 3.5 gallons or less 
per flush may be exempted from the retrofitting requirement at the May 7 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts agree that the toilet is the No. 1 water user in U.S. homes -- 
accounting for at least 25% of most families' usage. In contrast to the 
ultra-low flush units, which were introduced in Sweden in 1973, the vast 
majority of American toilets use from 3 to 7 gallons per flush. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy L. Corpening, a plumbing industry consultant, told about 150 local 
officials, plumbing contractors and others that about 1 million ultra-low flush 
toilets have been installed in U.S. bathrooms. This year, she said, U.S. 
manufacturers are expected to produce 2.4 million more. 
</P>
<P>
There are two basic ultra-low flush systems: gravity feed, a redesigned version 
of the conventional toilet, and the turbo type, which combines air and water 
pressure and is usually activated by pressing a button on the tank lid. The 
turbo types tend to be noisier and more expensive, but they're more effective 
than gravity units. 
</P>
<P>
One audience member at the Camarillo forum, Andy Lyskin, of Vic's Plumbing 
Supply Co. in Ventura, suggested that the city of Ventura should offer rebates 
to residents replacing older toilets, as the cities of Los Angeles and Santa 
Monica have done. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the audience noted that a tank dam, a plastic object to 
reduce the amount of water flowing into a toilet tank, costs only about $6.95. 
"They don't always work, but they're better than nothing," a panelist said. 
</P>
<P>
And, at no cost at all, Ventura city residents can fill plastic bags with water 
and put them in toilet tanks. City spokeswoman Carol Green said Friday that 
"boxes and boxes" of the free bags have been given away at City Hall. The city 
has also given away at least 6,000 low-flow shower heads, she said. JACK

MISDIRECTED ACCUSATIONS BY TOM ELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County Community College District Trustee Tom Ely's excuses and 
explanations regarding his alleged gambling debts, car accident and 
questionable spending of district funds are hard to swallow and even harder to 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious he has placed blame everywhere but where it should be placed. 
</P>
<P>
First, he says, the dumb cops didn't properly analyze the seriousness of the 
car accident and therefore didn't properly deduce that he and his wife, Ingrid, 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Then, some horrible person in the name of medical science prescribed 
painkillers that clouded his and his wife's judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Next, those nasty old people from the casino took advantage of said clouded 
judgment, forced the Elys to accept a free room, poured free alcohol down their 
throats and caused them to run up a sizable debt on top of the one they already 
owed. 
</P>
<P>
Next, some evil person uncovered and released information about the gambling 
debts in an attempt to destroy Ely's bid for county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Then, those rotten reporters misquoted Ely and misreported facts. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the terribly negligent college district put a phone and fax machine in 
Ely's home and even approved a rental car because his car was being repaired. 
It also approved sending Ely, and in some instances his wife, on several 
trustee trips, conferences and conventions, all in the name of conducting 
district business. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his fellow trustees, scoundrels that they are, had the audacity to 
question his ethics, judgment and expenditures. An auditing firm called in to 
investigate Ely's expense record wasn't smart enough to understand district 
policy, and that, compounded by the inept way the district's administrative 
services handles record-keeping, led to an erroneous report. 
</P>
<P>
To top things off, that publicity-seeking district attorney dared to do his job 
and initiated a criminal investigation of Ely's expenditure of college district 
funds, and some cold-hearted judge ruled in favor of some high-rolling, 
freewheeling bankers and lawyers whose flawed records indicate that Ely hasn't 
paid his bills. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe that the person at the center of all this attention is 
completely in the right and without guilt while all the other people or 
entities are misinformed, misguided, mistaken or just plain malicious. 
Consequently, it is not hard to believe actions that were dumb, horrible, 
nasty, evil, rotten, negligent, inept, erroneous, publicity-seeking, 
cold-hearted, high-rolling, freewheeling or flawed were more likely made by 
that person. 
</P>
<P>
I heartily call for Ely's resignation as a trustee of the college district. 
Furthermore, I would find the other trustees remiss in their responsibilities 
if they do not do likewise.

HANDLING OF STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have been following the stories about Robert Davis, the John H. Francis 
Polytechnic High School student recently arrested for living above the school's 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem more appropriate for Principal Virginia Holt to have referred him 
to a school counselor or social worker for housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's time would be better spent appealing decisions that return 
students who have assaulted teachers to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
This procedural mentality is the foundation of the educational crisis. It 
stifles creativity and initiative to maintain custodial integrity. We hope the 
mishandling of the situation has a greater impact on Holt's career than on that 
of Davis.

GET RID OF GALLEGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) has been talking out of both sides of his 
mouth for years: 
</P>
<P>
1. He claims to be an environmentalist, yet he co-sponsored a bill to open the 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration and supports 
increased offshore drilling off the California coastline. 
</P>
<P>
2. He claims to be a friend to senior citizens, yet he voted to lower funding 
for the Older Americans Act. 
</P>
<P>
3. He claims his only opposition to abortion is that he opposes paying for the 
procedure with federal funds, yet he supported a constitutional ban on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
4. He claims to be a staunch supporter of law and order, yet he voted against a 
raise in overtime pay for federal law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
And now, through recently released FBI documents, we find out that he lied 
about the conduct of FBI agents, manipulated the FBI into conducting an 
unnecessary investigation and lied several times to the public at large -- all 
to benefit his campaign for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
How long will the 21st District be fooled by this paranoid liar wearing the 
"Teflon suit"? If they think he is qualified to be our representative in 
Washington, well, I have some prime real estate for sale in the Florida 
swamplands.

PORTER RANCH REPORT MURKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report drawn up by city consultant Frank Fielding, the senior city planner 
for the San Fernando Valley who was the chief instigator and promoter of the 
immense, proposed Porter Ranch development, is notable for its deceptions and 
obfuscations. Fielding is not exactly an unbiased objective observer. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the report claims that the largest residential and commercial 
community ever to be built in Los Angeles is needed to bring a "better balance 
of jobs and housing." Yet, no scientific study has been made of this argument. 
Fielding admits that it would be "speculative," but nevertheless this is the 
evidence he submits for "needing" the project. 
</P>
<P>
The almost 4,000 homes would certainly not be available to the estimated 21,000 
construction, clerical and retail workers. They clearly could not afford 
high-priced housing. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, construction wage levels would not permit the purchase of expensive 
homes of a half-million dollars and upward. When they have finished their jobs, 
they will return to where they presently live each night after work. That is 
why Fielding refuses to tell exactly how many workers will actually end up 
living in Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The results could be catastrophic!

THOSE GUIDING LIGHTS OF YOUR TRAVEL ADVENTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIAN RINGER and ROY RINGER, The Ringers are Malibu free-lance writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the great adventures -- or misadventures -- of foreign travel is the 
luck of the draw when it comes to guides, whether thrust upon you by the tour 
operator or chosen by yourself off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the street fraternity is more entertaining, and often more likable, 
than the professionals. 
</P>
<P>
We met Paddy O'Hara, who was even more Irish than the name implies, on a summer 
afternoon in front of Buckingham Palace. 
</P>
<P>
He was wearing a bowler, a morning coat that could only have come from a dust 
bin, a pair of decrepit shoes, but no socks. 
</P>
<P>
He drew himself up to his full height of not much more than five feet and gave 
us a smart salute: "A veteran of the Great War, at your service." 
</P>
<P>
Although much of his information was at total variance with the London 
guidebooks, O'Hara was a congenial companion for the next three days. He would 
be waiting for us outside the Strand Palace Hotel in the morning and would 
return us there at night. 
</P>
<P>
Except for his special areas of expertise, such as finding the worst pub food 
in London, the scenes of its most lurid crimes, and back-wall peepholes into 
the private precincts of the Royal Family, he was an amazing font of 
misinformation, and we have never forgotten him. 
</P>
<P>
The least congenial guide we ever had in Europe was a wordy Swiss, who we were 
stuck with for seven days on a bus tour from the north of France to the 
Mediterranean. With PA mike in hand, Otto saw to it that nothing along the road 
should escape our attention: the 12th vineyard of the morning, a stand of plane 
trees, a farmer in his fields, a distant mountain. 
</P>
<P>
But his particular fascination was with the TGV, the world's fastest train. At 
more than one level crossing he would blast us awake from our afternoon naps 
with: "Attention! Train a Grande Vitesse!" By the time we could open our eyes, 
of course, it had already shot by at its cruising speed of 168 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, after 12 nonstop hours of minutiae, Otto would join us in the bar 
after dinner to cadge drinks and resume his nonstop monologue. We have never 
forgotten him, either. 
</P>
<P>
Guido, who once drove us from Naples to Pompeii in a mini-van, was an opera 
buff. We heard his commentary over a constant background of arias from the 
stereo system. 
</P>
<P>
As we were heading out of the city along the waterfront, he put a question to 
us: "Who knows where Caruso died? For the right answer I will pay 10,000 lira." 
</P>
<P>
"Right here in Naples," said one of the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"You are absolutely right," said the guide, "and you may deduct 10,000 lira 
from my tip." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the guide was taken to task by a woman tourist official at Pompeii for 
dawdling and holding up other parties. There was a loud shouting match, each 
threatening to report the other to tourism officials in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
Our guide drove us back in a silent rage, although a vengeful aria from Iago or 
Rigoletto on the stereo would have been appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Once in Naples the damage to his dignity was such that he left us at the hotel 
and sped off without a word or without collecting a single tip. 
</P>
<P>
Two women guides stand out in memory. One, whom we shall call Ilona, was from 
Budapest, and was to have been our leader on a 10-day bus tour from Munich 
through Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
She met us and two women from New York City in the lobby of our Munich hotel 
the night before our departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I have bad news," she said. "Only you four have signed up for the tour. There 
will be no bus. We will ride in a Mercedes-Benz with a Yugoslav driver." Her 
reading of Yugoslav had an ominous tone. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, to our surprise, she said we should call the company and cancel 
because the tour was not as advertised. We were beginning to suspect that her 
heart was not in her work. 
</P>
<P>
The New Yorkers did try to cancel, but without success, and the following 
morning we met in front of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Ilona was sobbing. The driver, whose name was Bora, was obviously sympathetic. 
He took us aside and said that Ilona's mother was gravely ill in a hospital in 
Budapest, but the company would not let her leave the tour until a replacement 
could be found. 
</P>
<P>
For the next five days a tearful Ilona met us every morning with the same 
apology: "I'm sorry but I cannot help you today. Bora will help you." 
</P>
<P>
Bora drove at life-threatening speeds, knew nothing of the points of interest 
along the route and invariably became lost in even the smallest cities. 
</P>
<P>
To compound our difficulties, we were kept waiting for an hour or longer at 
every border. This was before the movement toward democracy in Eastern Europe; 
communist frontier guards were quick to recognize four Americans in a black 
stretch Mercedes-Benz as arrogant capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bora's pleadings, we sat and sat while other cars and tour buses went 
through with little delay. 
</P>
<P>
We finally got to Budapest, where the replacement guide was waiting at a hotel. 
Bora then drove off at high speed to deliver the still-sobbing Ilona to her 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Our new guide told us that evening over dinner that the mother was suffering 
from nothing more serious than anemia and was in the hospital for a series of 
tests. But the new guide, like Bora, was most sympathetic: "They're very close, 
Ilona and her mother." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to our time with the tragic Ilona, a day spent with Rosalynd Pio in 
Florence was the highlight of our visit to that incredible city. 
</P>
<P>
She was a strikingly attractive woman in her mid-30s who had come to Florence 
years before, after majoring in Renaissance art in her native England. She had 
been married to an Italian journalist, but was now living alone. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalynd won us over the moment we first saw her outside the Duomo, the 
starting point for our morning tour. Like all guides working in large crowds, 
she had to raise a standard to which her flock could rally. 
</P>
<P>
Most guides hoist pennants of various colors or even placards bearing their 
names or the number of the tour. But not Rosalynd; atop her staff was one 
perfect rose. 
</P>
<P>
We spent the next three hours following that rose through the Duomo, Uffizi, 
Palazzo Pitti and the swarming streets of the city. Rosalynd was a witty and 
knowledgeable guide and clearly a favorite with the staffs of the museums. 
</P>
<P>
After the tour, the three of us had lunch in a small family cafe of her choice 
just a block off the Arno. She then drove us in her rattletrap car to her 
apartment above the Boboli Gardens, and we spent the afternoon in a cool patio, 
sipping white wine and leafing through her library of art books. 
</P>
<P>
Much of her conversation was of friends and family in England, from whom she 
had been long away. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she drove us down the hill and across the river to our hotel. And we 
were left with two lasting memories -- a little car vanishing down a dark 
street and one perfect rose dancing over crowds of tourists in the streets of 
Florence.

<P>
If you know a good rain dance, San Diego should be high on your list of weekend 
getaways. 
</P>
<P>
Staking their chances on the area's traditionally good weather, the city's 
three Sheraton Hotels have come up with an unusual offer: If the sun doesn't 
shine at least once during a 48-hour visit, guests stay for free. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is good through May 24 at the Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines, the 
Sheraton Harbor Island and the Sheraton Grand on Harbor Island. If the clouds 
don't cooperate, the room rate is $129 per night, based on availability and a 
minimum two-night stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize this is a gamble, but we're willing to bank on Mother Nature," said 
Larry Saward, general manager of the Sheraton Harbor Island. 
</P>
<P>
For more information and reservations at any Sheraton, call toll-free (800) 
325-3535. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Blues: According to figures compiled by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization and published in the Paris-based Aeroports magazine, the 
number of travelers using airports in the United States declined by 1% in 1989, 
mainly because of saturation of capacities both on the ground and in the air, 
as well as higher air fares. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chicago, Los Angeles and Dallas all bucked the trend, with increases 
of 2.1%, 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
American airports remained among the world's busiest. New York's Kennedy, La 
Guardia and Newark airports handled a combined 74.4 million passengers, the 
most in the world, followed by Chicago's two airports with 67.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
London was third with 62.8 million, followed by Tokyo, Los Angeles, Dallas, 
Paris, Atlanta, San Francisco and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Any Port in a Storm: Wine lovers have a new spot in which to pass the time if 
they're delayed by weather or any other reason at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. 
</P>
<P>
A "Wines of America" retail store and wine bar has opened at the airport, and 
it features 230 different wines from 32 states. It is billed as the first 
complete collection of wines from states across America. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people can't believe that there is a port from Louisiana or a sherry from 
Minnesota," said Essi Pourhadi, director of operations for Carson 
International, the company that runs the food and beverage concessions at the 
airport. "We feature wines from unexpected states like Hawaii, Mississippi, 
Ohio and Colorado, as well as the best wines from California, Oregon and 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Travelers can find the wine collection at the round building between Terminals 
2 and 3. Bottles can be purchased and shipped directly from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Irish Ayes: Northern Ireland, usually in the headlines over one of the world's 
longest-running guerrilla conflicts, had a record year for tourism in 1989 with 
more than 1.2 million visitors, up 20% over the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists Beware: A Thai government plan to issue identity cards to prostitutes 
who pass regular tests for acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other sexual 
diseases has been criticized as "misleading" and "a gimmick to keep the 
tourists coming" by a leading Thai AIDS campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
Thailand's brothels, bars and massage parlors lure thousands of foreign 
tourists as well as locals. The government estimates that there are 80,000 
prostitutes in Thailand, but social workers say the figure is much higher. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the government promoting the sex industry," said Sommatra Troy of the 
Thai AIDS Society. "Just carrying the card doesn't mean a girl is free from 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Should the customer have to show a card too?" 
</P>
<P>
Sommatra said the system was also open to forgeries and corruption by officials 
issuing the cards, and accused the government of acting out of concern for the 
tourist industry -- Thailand's biggest foreign exchange earner -- rather than 
for prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
On a Musical Note: A project is under way in Mexico City to invigorate the 
cultural life of Garibaldi Square, the plaza where troupes of costumed mariachi 
musicians long have serenaded visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government has dedicated nearly $1 million to create a music hall 
and conservatory nearby. Construction is scheduled to be completed by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Plans also include parking facilities to control traffic congestion in the 
square, a popular tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
FYI: The Smithsonian Institution in Washington has opened an information center 
on the National Mall to help visitors sort through the 14-museum complex. In 
the Smithsonian building known as The Castle, the center is open daily from 9 
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The center includes two orientation theaters, interactive touch-screen 
terminals, two monitors that list current activities and two electronic wall 
maps. 
</P>
<P>
Rail-Splitter: A special introductory two-for-one offer for all package tours 
aboard the California Sun Express has been announced by Princess Tours rail 
division. 
</P>
<P>
The offer will apply on packages for which travel takes place on or before May 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The privately owned California Sun Express started operating April 1 as part of 
Amtrak's Coast Starlight between Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo and Oakland.

THE TASTE OF TRAVEL: BASEL FLAVORS COMBINE BEST OF THREE NATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
BASEL, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Just take the No. 15 streetcar to Bruderholz and you'll be here," said the 
voice on the phone. "The restaurant is in a house, but there's a sign." 
</P>
<P>
Taking the street car to a Michelin two-star restaurant seemed a bit peculiar, 
but Basel, in northeastern Switzerland, is full of contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of under 200,000 and one of the highest per capita incomes in 
Europe, the city has more than 30 museums, the largest zoo in Europe and some 
excellent restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Just minutes from the French and German borders, Basel reflects the culinary 
influences of both countries, with large helpings of traditional Swiss cuisine 
added to the mix. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's restaurants are either within walking distance of the major 
hotels or easily accessible by public transportation. So we boarded the trolley 
for the 15-minute ride to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Bruderholz Stucki was like a private home. Three dining rooms occupy the ground 
floor, and in warm weather there's dining in the garden. For nearly 30 years 
chef Hans Stucki and his wife Susi have lived upstairs and served customers in 
the rooms below. 
</P>
<P>
We dined in the Francais room, where crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling 
and German porcelain vases with fresh roses decorated the tables. Tall glass 
doors offered views of the garden outside. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many celebrity chefs, Stucki is nearly always in the kitchen creating 
some of the most exciting cuisine in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Gourmet magazine columnist Fred Ferretti first told us about Hans Stucki: "If 
he spent more time doing publicity and playing politics, he'd be famous. But 
he'd rather cook, and as a result his restaurant is not as well known as it 
deserves to be." 
</P>
<P>
The menu is extensive and changes according to the season, but the best way to 
sample the food here is to select from the multi-course menu. 
</P>
<P>
We began with an amuse bouche (literally a little tidbit to "amuse the mouth") 
of smoked eel with chopped onion and radishes. 
</P>
<P>
Then fresh duck liver that had been cooked until just warmed through and 
crunchy on the outside was served with onions marinated in a clear sweet and 
sour sauce. 
</P>
<P>
This was followed by lobster with curry butter and seaweed that added a fresh, 
sea-spray flavor. Fillet de St. Pierre, a firm white fish in a smooth buttery 
sea urchin cream, was served with fresh lima beans and wild rice. 
</P>
<P>
Roasted pigeon came in a black truffle coulis and was served with Swiss chard 
in cream with chives, fresh pea puree and baby carrots. Each ingredient was 
allowed to retain its own flavor, yet all worked together. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooking is like making music. All of the elements must be in harmony," Stucki 
told us, as we walked through the garden between courses. "A sauce shouldn't 
overwhelm but complement, like the cellos in an orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
We returned to more symphonies of flavor. A serving of several Swiss cheeses 
came with freshly baked whole grain walnut and prune breads. 
</P>
<P>
Finally it was time for dessert or, more accurately, desserts. Stucki shares 
our belief that dessert is the most important part of any meal. 
</P>
<P>
First served was a selection of sorbets: grapefruit, passion fruit, black 
currant and kumquat. Afterward came a plate of perfect raspberries, wild 
strawberries and red currants. 
</P>
<P>
The most complex dessert was a chocolate-lined pastry shell filled with custard 
and topped with three perfect raspberries. Also on the plate was a still-warm, 
caramel-glazed meringue served with cream whipped with vanilla bean. It was 
served with coconut ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-course meal cost about $83. Less extensive prix fixe menus at Stucki 
cost $48 to $62. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, at the recommendation of our hotel concierge, we walked a few 
blocks to Elisbethenstubli, a favorite of locals, for an early dinner. 
</P>
<P>
We dined on grilled calves liver, paillard of veal and rosti potatoes. Served 
in an iron skillet, the wonderful potatoes were crusty and full of butter. 
</P>
<P>
Rosti is a national passion in Switzerland, and the grated potatoes often are 
served with ham or bacon and a topping of melted cheese. This dinner cost about 
$40 for two. 
</P>
<P>
But if Elisbethenstubli represents some of the best of traditional Basel 
cooking, surely the future lies at Der Teufelhof Basel. 
</P>
<P>
The century-old house in Basel's medieval section has been converted into a 
small hotel, two avant-garde theaters and two restaurants. Upstairs is the more 
formal Das restaurant, but we chose the more casual Die Weinstube, a modern 
room with blond wood and French doors opening onto a little courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
We began with a salad of fresh greens topped with slices of warm duck liver 
served with raspberry vinaigrette. Veal steak came with a light cream sauce. 
Veal is a local specialty and we found it much more flavorful than American 
veal. The meal cost about $80 for two. 
</P>
<P>
Basel does offer good, inexpensive to moderate dining. We spent a warm 
afternoon at the Basel Zoo, eating several kinds of sausages grilled at 
open-air stalls. Most varieties were under $3 and were accompanied by hard 
rolls and mustard. Other stands served beer, soft drinks and ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps only in Switzerland would we recommend dining in a train station, but 
the Bahnhof Buffet in the main Basel train station is a must, even if the only 
reason for visiting it is to admire the art. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Berchtold, who manages the three restaurants that comprise the Bahnhof 
Buffet, spent nine years at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco and enjoys 
Americans. The two major rooms, the Brasserie and Restaurant DeVille, offer the 
same menu and share a kitchen, but the Brasserie is slightly cheaper and less 
formal. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the station is in France, and L'Escargot is the buffet's cozy French 
bistro. It's downstairs and hidden away, so you may have to ask directions, but 
finding it is worth the effort. The menu is French with Swiss specialties. 
</P>
<P>
We had a hot cream of cucumber soup and split a rack of lamb with a dish of 
creamed potatoes that had been lightly browned in the oven. Figure on $20 to 
$30 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the city are shops selling cheeses, sausages and breads, so picnics 
are in order. And as this city is noted for its whole grain breads, the best 
place to try them is Zoller, a bakery offering more than 20 varieties each day. 
You can also buy the famous Basel lackerli, a hard, spicy, biscuit-like cookie 
that is delicious with the strong coffee served everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: Bahnhof Buffet Basel, Centralbahnstrasse 14. Der Teufelhof Basel, 
Leonhardsgraben 47. Elisbethenstubli, Elisabethenstrasse 34/3-34. Restaurant 
Bruderholz Stucki, Bruderholzallee 42.

RECREATION AND WILDLIFE RETURN TO MT. ST. HELENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A morning trek of Roosevelt elk along a well-tracked slope near Strawberry 
Mountain continues to surprise park visitors. Long-term outlook: a return to 
the forest's pre-eruption state in 150 to 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the volcano's furor, the forest service's initial efforts to open 
Mt. St. Helens to the public were only tentative. Facilities were minimal and 
early entrance was via newly paved or improved surface logging roads. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, major roads have been upgraded to two-way paved routes that can 
accommodate recreational vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The planned 1992 reopening of Spirit Lake Highway to Coldwater Lake, and the 
proposed Johnston Ridge Observation Site -- five miles north of the crater and 
feet from where U.S. Geological Service volcano watcher David Johnston, one of 
several deaths resulting from the volcano, perished -- will mark the 
culmination of a long-term plan for maximizing visitor use of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the monument offers year-round recreation as it did in the past, with 
hiking, fishing, bird watching, spelunking, mountain climbing, snowmobiling, 
cross-country skiing and, of course, volcano watching. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980 eruption, 15,000 climbers a year ascended the back of Mt. St. 
Helens. With the opening of the mountain to climbers in 1987, the mountain has 
once again become one of the most climbed peaks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ape Cave, longest lava tube in the continental United States, allows one to 
take a lantern and probe the underground mystery created by an eruption about 
1,900 years ago. For photography and sketching, the park boasts prized 
vantages. Sites include Lahar, Bear Meadow, Windy Ridge and Strawberry 
Mountain. When complete, Johnston Ridge Observation Site will allow visitors to 
look into the crater. 
</P>
<P>
Private helicopter and small plane tours, operating out of the surrounding 
towns of Cougar, Toutle and Randle, provide elevated looks at the crater, the 
mudflows and blast zone. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the trail system has continued to grow. Norway Pass offers one 
of the finest St. Helena views, overlooking Spirit Lake. Cedar Flats, Harmony 
Falls, Lewis River and Boundary trails unravel more of the story, pre- and 
post-eruption, with many other trails offering long distance, overnight hikes. 
</P>
<P>
The nordic trail system south of the mountain, likewise, has expanded with the 
Swift Creek and June Lake trails and with Sasquatch and Toutle trail systems. 
Meadows offer beginners an open playground. Snowmobile routes travel to Marble 
Meadows or follow the lahar (debris flow) to the Plains of Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
Although accommodations still lie outside the park in forest service lands, 
utility and private campgrounds or hotel/motel services are growing more 
frequent in surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever one's favorite pursuit, Mt. St. Helens is rising to the call.

CONSUMER REPORT: RECREATIONAL VEHICLES MAKING MAJOR INROADS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: RV AND MOTOR-HOME RENTAL VACATIONS ARE GROWING IN POPULARITY. 
THEIRAPPEAL IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN ATTRACTING MORE THAN JUST RETIREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A growing vacation experience sought by families or small groups is the renting 
of a recreational vehicle or motor home, either independently or as part of a 
package tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Rentals are the fastest-growing segment of the RV market, and have been 
basically doubling annually over the past several years," said Karen Mason of 
the Recreational Vehicle Industry Assn. "Of the 25-million RVers in the United 
States, about 3 million are renters." 
</P>
<P>
A type of RV tour called "caravaning" enables groups to travel along designated 
routes at the individual's own pace during the day. At night, participants meet 
at a predetermined area. 
</P>
<P>
As with standard escorted tours, a professional guide called "wagonmaster" or 
"caravan master" goes along. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other kinds of tours, these RV packages may also have a person, called 
the "tailgunner," traveling behind the caravan. The tailgunner handles 
mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Such RV caravan packages are available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, 
Europe, Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
"In the continental United States, our packages are for people who own RVs, but 
in Alaska and abroad we use rentals," said Shirley Cliff, a spokeswoman for 
Compass RV Tours of Greenville, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"We limit the number of vehicles to 15, so they can be spread out and not on 
top of each other. It's sort of a loose procession, and people can go off on 
their own for special sightseeing." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans-based Creative World Rallies and Caravans offers packages in 
several parts of the world, including Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone gets a trip log, indicating points of interest on the route," said 
company President Bill LaGrange. "They can proceed as they wish on what we call 
a 'scattered caravan.' They have a phone number to call at the evening 
rendezvous in case they decide not to show up that night." 
</P>
<P>
Participants also receive standard sightseeing tours in key cities. "The usual 
sightseeing buses pick up and return people to the campsites we use," LaGrange 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Costs may include rental, vehicle and personal insurance, RV park reservations 
and site fees, round-trip air fare to pickup point, ferry or train 
reservations, emergency roadside assistance and itineraries and road 
guides/route information. Some meals may be part of the program. Visas and 
permits also are provided. 
</P>
<P>
Some packages may include other forms of travel. For example, Compass RV Tours 
offers an Alaska package that features a four-night cruise along the Inside 
Passage, and a South Pacific program that uses motor homes in New Zealand and 
hotels in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The caravans can encompass a variety of activities, including visits to 
sightseeing attractions, entertainment and group meals at campsites and 
restaurants. Special-interest caravans, such as for fishing, bird watching and 
photography, also are available. 
</P>
<P>
RVs also are offered on an independent basis. In the past, RVs were used 
primarily by retirees. According to the Travel Industry Assn. of America, 
however, the 35-to-54 age group is expected to make a dent in RV trips in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Advantages of RV travel are the saving of hotel costs, eating out, and the 
convenience of almost no packing and unpacking. Generally, the cost of an RV 
package can average less than the daily combined cost of hotels and meals. 
</P>
<P>
RV/motor homes, available in various sizes, have kitchen facilities. Food can 
be stored in a refrigerator unit. Microwave ovens also are often available. 
There's also dining and sleeping space and bathrooms. Televisions, 
videocassette players and stereos may also be part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
Driving large RV vehicles may seem scary to some, but may be easier that one 
thinks. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people think the RV is too big to drive," said Bill Calderone, director 
of marketing for Miami-based Cruise America. "They don't realize that the RVs 
come with power steering and brakes as well as automatic transmission. 
Generally, no special driver's license is needed. It's not like driving a big 
truck." 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 public and private campgrounds and RV resorts are scattered 
around the United States. Some of these campgrounds include tennis courts, golf 
courses and health spas -- with prices to match, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
But before rushing out to rent an RV, consider these points: Renting an RV is 
more complicated than renting a car. The application forms involve more 
questions. Unlike car rentals, you have to pay up front. Credit cards, however, 
can be used. 
</P>
<P>
Computation of charges is based on the number of days of the rental agreement 
and estimates of the distance to be traveled, with differences in the actual 
cost refunded upon return of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Expect to pay several deposits on the vehicle. According to the RVIA, security 
deposits average about $500; cleaning deposits of $50 are common, and 
sanitizing fees of $50 may also be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Rental firms may have a minimum of days (one to seven days) that you can rent 
the RV. The summer and holiday periods are likely to involve the need for 
longer rentals. Reservations are important. 
</P>
<P>
Find out what your insurance coverage costs and what it covers. Some rentals 
include special insurance provisions with extra protection that you can buy. 
Check to see if your automobile insurance covers you in any way. Basic 
insurance coverage averages $10 to $15 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some RV-rental companies require drivers to be at least 25 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Our age limit for drivers is 21. All additional drivers have to be identified 
at the time of rental," Calderone said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, find out if you get free mileage included in the rental price. 
Free mileage per day can be 100 miles or less. After the free mileage, a charge 
of 25 to 50 cents per mile can be charged to the rental costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our free mileage depends on the length of the rental," said Teresa Toney, a 
spokeswoman for U-Haul International's RV rental division. "The longer the 
rental, the more free mileage that may be allowed." 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to ask questions before you sign an agreement. Everyone will have some. 
</P>
<P>
The questions can cover orientation sessions, equipment and appliances. Also, 
the items that come with the rental, such as towels, linens and kitchen 
utensils or housekeeping packages. 
</P>
<P>
Prices may vary from a $50-to-$100 flat fee to $30 per person per trip. 
Travelers flying to their pickup point for the RVs may want to rent a 
housekeeping package to avoid packing essentials. 
</P>
<P>
Check to see if the RV-rental firm offers any perks with its rentals, such as 
discounts at campgrounds and sightseeing attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a hot line phone number to call in case of need? Will such a number be 
toll-free? And during what hours will the line be operating? 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to this form of travel should test it first before taking long trips. 
Go for a weekend getaway.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: GOLD MINING MAY RETURN TO BODIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE and TOM GRIMM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BODIE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a young girl discovered her family was moving to California's most 
notorious gold-mining town, she lamented in her diary: "Goodby God, I'm going 
to Bodie," a phrase that afterward became famous throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
Born of an 1859 gold strike in desolate, high-desert country on the eastern 
slopes of the Sierra Nevada, Bodie became known for its bad climate and bad 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the wares of 65 saloons, the hard-drinking miners made street 
fighting their favorite pastime. Undertakers carried losers to the cemetery 
almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
When the mines finally gave out after yielding more than $100 million in gold, 
its 10,000 residents left and Bodie became a ghost town. To save the site and 
about 170 buildings that remained, the state made Bodie a historic park in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
Maintained in what has been described as a state of "arrested decay," Bodie is 
the most authentic ghost town in California. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, gold mining may be revived at Bodie. However rich the diggings, 
some folks are up in arms. Citizens have formed a "Save Bodie!" group to 
prevent an international gold-mining corporation from digging into the hills 
above the town. 
</P>
<P>
Galactic Resources of Vancouver, Canada, has bought inactive mining claims on 
private lands on Bodie Bluff and on an adjacent ridge that overlooks the park. 
The company also has filed claim to adjoining property under control of the 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have indicated that more than 1.25 million ounces of gold and 10 
million ounces of silver could be recovered from open-pit or other mines and by 
using modern machinery and techniques to extract the metal. Galactic's 
subsidiary, Bodie Consolidated Mining Co., based in Bridgeport, Calif., made 
drilling tests last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans additional tests at the end of this month. Meanwhile, the 
state Senate adopted a resolution earlier this month requesting that the 
federal government withdraw mining as a permitted use of land around Bodie. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Bodie! group is worried that open-pit mining will damage, if not 
destroy, the character and setting of the ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
The group is seeking to prevent change in the area surrounding the town, which 
is designated a National Historic Landmark and is listed in the National 
Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
To visit Bodie, drive north from Los Angeles on U.S. 395. A few miles beyond 
Mono Lake but before reaching Bridgeport, turn right on California 270. 
</P>
<P>
The road wanders 13 miles eastward through uninhabited terrain before ending at 
Bodie. The last three miles are unpaved. In a basin rimmed by barren hills 
you'll find Bodie, which resembles a Hollywood Western movie set. 
</P>
<P>
Dirt streets of this town 8,375 feet above sea level are flanked by rippled 
boardwalks leading past false-front buildings of weathered wood and tin roofs. 
A bell tower marks the old Methodist Church, and on a hillside, off in the 
distance, is the Standard Mine stamping mill. 
</P>
<P>
The mine's success (about $15 million in gold in 25 years), starting in 1878, 
brought prosperity. Some miners and entrepreneurs, of course, never left town. 
They are buried on another hillside in a cemetery that had separate sections 
for members of the Miners' Union and the Masonic Hall, respected citizens and 
the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
A granite block marks the resting place of town founder Waterman S. Body (also 
known as William S. Bodey). He discovered gold here in 1859 but died later that 
year in a blizzard. In winter, snow can pile up 20 feet high, winds can get up 
to 100 m.p.h. and temperatures can drop 30 to 40 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
The spelling of the town name as Bodie, instead of Body, has been attributed to 
an illiterate sign painter. But historians contend it that was deliberately 
written that way to prevent mispronunciation to "bah-dee." 
</P>
<P>
It costs $3 per car entry fee at the parking lot or at the entry station, which 
reopens Memorial Day weekend. Afterward, go down the trail to town and the park 
office on Green Street. For four quarters a machine will spew out a Bodie 
brochure with a walking-tour map. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking is prohibited in the 500-acre park except for the parking lot. Fires in 
1892 and 1932, as well as vandals and cold winters, have destroyed about 95% of 
the original structures. 
</P>
<P>
There is still plenty to see. All of Bodie's remaining buildings have been 
preserved just as they were when the last residents left in 1935. A watchman 
patrolled Bodie until it became a park 28 years ago. Today the only population 
is nine -- two rangers, a maintenance man and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Although all buildings are closed to the public, guests can peek in windows and 
open doors. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Memorial Day weekend and continuing through the summer the 
112-year-old Miners' Union Hall reopens as the park's visitor center and 
museum. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. A visit also can be made to the sparsely 
furnished Miller House, whose owner, Tom Miller, worked for a railway that 
transported the pine lumber used for building much of Bodie. 
</P>
<P>
Also beginning Memorial Day weekend, visitors may take a guided tour of the 
Standard Mill, where gold ore was crushed and processed. 
</P>
<P>
One-hour tours, at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., are offered on weekends throughout 
summer. Each is limited to 20 people. For a reservation, get a tour token at 
the visitor center and museum when you first enter the park. 
</P>
<P>
Bodie has no restaurants, shops or other commercial facilities. If you bring 
food and drinks, you can lunch in the picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
Camping is outlawed. The nearest campgrounds, lodgings, restaurants and gas 
stations are south at Lee Vining and north at Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
Park hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but closing time extends to 7 p.m. from 
Memorial Day through Labor Day weekends. 
</P>
<P>
For information, including weather and road conditions, call (619) 647-6445. 
</P>
<P>

Bodie!, P.O. Box 28366, Sacramento 95828, and Mark Whitehead, Project Manager,

Round trip from Los Angeles to Bodie State Historic Park is 710 miles.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spite. It's not a pretty emotion. But my, is it a pretty house. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Frederick, have long had reason to thank Dr. John Tyler for a 
particular fit of pique in 1814. Among the most grateful are Bill and Andrea 
Myer, who have turned the landmark Spite House, now called the Tyler-Spite 
House, into a pioneering bed and breakfast business. 
</P>
<P>
The story of the Tyler-Spite House, enshrined in folklore, is this: 
</P>
<P>
Tyler was an eminent ophthalmologist, the first American-born physician to 
perform a cataract operation, and owner of several choice parcels of Frederick 
land, which he had bought at public auction from the confiscated estate of a 
notorious Tory. 
</P>
<P>
In 1814, one of these parcels, on the courthouse square, lay in the way of the 
city's plans to extend Record Street south to meet West Patrick Street. The 
idea of a road cutting across his land, next to his house, did not please the 
strong-willed doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Like many latter-day property owners threatened by development, Tyler protested 
the move. But he did more -- he decided to fight City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of his research he discovered a local law that said if a 
substantial building was placed in the path of a proposed road or work was in 
progress, the road could not be built. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor found a building contractor willing to start work that very night. 
When the road crews arrived in the morning, they found a hole in the ground 
where their road was supposed to go and workmen were building a foundation. 
Sitting in a chair overlooking the work was the spiteful, self-satisfied Dr. 
John Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler never lived in the classically handsome, three-story building, preferring 
to rent it to tenants. (His own house, next door, is now the Church House of 
All Saints Episcopal Church.) 
</P>
<P>
Since Tyler's death the Tyler-Spite House has passed through the hands of 
several families, including the Kunkels, who enlarged it in the mid-19th 
Century, and the Posses, who modernized its systems and restored it in the 20th 
Century, adding a swimming pool in the back. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent owners were the Philippines-based family of World War II naval 
hero Charles (Chick) Parsons. When the Parsonses made plans to sell, the Myers, 
who lived in the house next door, naturally took an interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Myers have been involved with historic properties and preservation for 
several years. They restored their own Lane House, a former home of the 
families of two Maryland governors, as well as a western Maryland Gothic 
landmark, which they run as a bed and breakfast inn. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, as proprietors of the Castle in Mount Savage, they saw the 
Tyler-Spite House's ample B&amp;B potential. Not only did it have commercial 
zoning, off-street parking, six bedrooms and the kind of old-fashioned splendor 
that inn-lovers seek, but it filled a community niche. 
</P>
<P>
Although Frederick has the kind of restaurants, historic buildings and antique 
shops that attract tourists, it has a dearth of B&amp;Bs in which to house 
them. There is only one other bed and breakfast inn within the city, and no 
other in the downtown historic district. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bill Myer, the Parsonses were enthusiastic about the idea, which 
would save the grand old building from the probable fate of being converted to 
office use. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the Tyler-Spite House in shape for the public took three months, not 
only for cosmetic fix-ups but to get the legal technicalities straightened out. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to get an attorney, then we had to get it surveyed, and get a planner 
to make sure it fit in with the historical plans of downtown Frederick," Bill 
Myer said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite support from Frederick's then-Mayor Ron Young, the process was more 
drawn-out and expensive than anticipated, in part because of the efforts of a 
group of neighbors who petitioned against the business, having heard 
(mistakenly) that there would be a restaurant serving liquor on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
The decorating, directed by Andrea Myer, was done quickly but with panache, and 
features a mixture of antiques from the Myers collection, new furniture 
combining comfort, durability and a traditional look, and some pieces that were 
bought along with the house. 
</P>
<P>
The "legacies" include the early 19th-Century portraits in the family and music 
room, and many Philippine mahogany pieces that had belonged to the Parsonses. 
</P>
<P>
On the very desk in the front hall that holds the house's literature and guest 
book, Gen. Douglas MacArthur signed the treaty that ended the Japanese 
occupation of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Myer repainted the rooms. The library, in which tea is served, is a rosy 
brick-red that matches the red Maryland marble fireplace. New chandeliers were 
installed above the magnificent winding stairway and throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
The second-floor bedrooms, two of which have canopy beds, are decorated in a 
formal, traditional mode that matches the house's architecture. Those bedrooms 
on the third floor favor a more romantic, Victorian look. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Harry L. Decker, Frederick's historian, they gave each of the 
rooms the name of a historic notable with Frederick connections. 
</P>
<P>
The library, for instance, was named for Samuel Knox, who pioneered public 
education in Maryland. Henry C. Dielman, the first American composer to receive 
a doctor of music degree, gave his name to the music room, and John Collins, 
camp cook for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was used for kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous local folks commemorated here (with a foyer and a bedroom) are 
"Star-Spangled Banner" author Francis Scott Key and Union patriot Barbara 
Fritchie, whose legend Decker, unlike some historians, staunchly upholds. 
</P>
<P>
The Myers welcomed their first guests in January, and have been working ever 
since to perfect their B&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
They have moved their check-in time from 4 p.m. to 1 p.m. so visitors will be 
able to walk around the historic district (City Hall is right across the 
street) and scout the antique markets in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
They provide a "modified high tea" of cheese, pate, fruit and an extravagant 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
And as a final touch of luxury, they have contracted with Darryl Putman of the 
Sundance Carriage Co. to take guests to a restaurant of their choice in an 
antique horse-drawn carriage. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes. The Myers also gave their house a new name: the Tyler-Spite House. To 
soften it somewhat, Andrea Myer says. The doctor undoubtedly would be pleased.

YOUTH BEAT: TAKE A DOUBLE-DECK BUS THROUGH SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the more interesting ways that students and other young travelers can 
visit the now popular Soviet Union is aboard a double-decker bus. 
</P>
<P>
Top Deck, a 17-year-old British company and operator of double-decker bus 
tours, is such a company. Its fleet of 50 former London Transport buses is now 
a familiar sight on the Asian overland routes. This summer it is also offering 
a 29-day "Deckerhome" program starting in London and visiting Holland, Germany, 
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Soviet Union and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Rates $1,048 to $1,138, plus $214 for a communal food fund and $61 for 
compulsory visa charges. 
</P>
<P>
Each Deckerhome sleeps 15 to 20 passengers, with bunks and lockers on the upper 
level and living and dining areas and fold-down bunks on the lower level. 
</P>
<P>
One of the advantages of traveling with Top Deck is that its programs are 
marketed internationally, so American youths get the opportunity to make 
friends among people from foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its Deckerhome tours, Top Deck operates coach tour programs, 
using camping sites, cabins and hotels in Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching a tent can help stretch funds. Join a 33-day coach-camping program 
that travels from London to Holland, Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, 
Romania, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, returning to London. Price 
is $1,269, plus $231 for the food fund and $72 for visas. 
</P>
<P>
If you want a few more comforts there is a 45-day program that incorporates 
camping, cabins and hotel accommodations, and travel by coach. 
</P>
<P>
It starts in London and visits Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, 
Sweden, Norway, Finland, Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and 
returns to London. Rates $1,276 to $1,444, plus $324 for the communal food fund 
and $61 for visas. 
</P>
<P>
Further details on Top Deck programs are available through travel agents, or

</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian Student Travel Service has made arrangements with North 
American student travel agencies to market its summer tours into the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The SSTS programs are specifically geared to travelers who are under 35 and 
"crave adventure more than luxury and comfort." 
</P>
<P>
An SSTS guide accompanies the international group, and daily programs, 
including visits with Soviet students, are arranged by the Soviet Youth Travel 
Bureau, Sputnik. 
</P>
<P>
Programs seven to 14 days are priced with and without round-trip air 
transportation between Copenhagen and the Soviet Union. Accommodations are in 
two- or three-bed rooms, while on trains four-berth compartments are shared. 
</P>
<P>
One of the least expensive SSTS programs is a seven-day tour of Moscow and 
Leningrad for $405, or $695 with flights from Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
You do not have to be a student to go on SSTS tours. SSTS also offers programs 
for traveling the Trans-Siberian railway and for visiting China. 
</P>
<P>
More details on all SSTS programs are available from STA Travel, 7202 Melrose 
Ave., Los Angeles 90046, (213) 934-8722.

GOOD TIME CRUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Shirley Slater and Harry Basch story on the new cruise liner Fantasy 
("Don't Look for Subtle Decor on Fantasy Ship," March 25) does not tell the 
whole story. 
</P>
<P>
They describe the ship's decor as "frenetic," "flash" and "dazzle," "like 
walking into a giant jukebox." 
</P>
<P>
Well, what do they want? Do they want to walk into a funeral parlor, a morgue? 
Do they want prison gray, a Kansas wheat field, dullness and monotony, a seedy, 
shabby replica of a gentleman's luncheon club, a library reading room? 
</P>
<P>
I, too, was on the first cruise. I found the ship bright, lively. It challenges 
you to relax, enjoy and have a good time. What is a cruise for, anyway?

NIXON TRIES IT AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE ARENA A MEMOIR OF VICTORY, DEFEAT, AND RENEWAL BY RICHARD NIXON (SIMON 
&amp; SCHUSTER: $21.95; 384 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John B. Judis, Judis is senior editor of In These Times and author of 
William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives, recently released 
in paper by Touchstone. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once the most scorned politician in America, former President Richard M. Nixon 
is now lionized by both liberals and conservatives and is regularly consulted 
on foreign policy and political strategy by the Bush Administration and 
Congressional leaders. Yet, Nixon's latest book, "In the Arena," is an eloquent 
reminder of his profound limitations as a politician and political thinker. Its 
callow attempts at self-justification and its neo-Cold War policy prescriptions 
reflect a man who is still bedeviled by his past. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon devotes a good deal of "In the Arena" to lame excuses for Watergate. 
Perhaps assuming that Americans' memories have dimmed, Nixon reduces the entire 
Watergate scandal to campaign peccadilloes. "At the core of the scandal was the 
fact that individuals associated with my reelection campaign were caught 
breaking into and installing telephone wiretaps at the headquarters of the 
Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Hotel," he writes. He either 
denies or minimizes his role in the sundry assaults on Constitutional liberties 
that the Watergate investigation uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon insists that the numerous wiretaps he ordered were "carefully limited and 
totally legal for reasons of national security. . . . We were concerned that 
leaks might abort our secret China initiatives and our Vietnam peace 
negotiations." But the wiretaps were first installed in spring, 1969, on 
Nixon's National Security Council and two of his closest aides after the New 
York Times revealed that Nixon had begun secretly bombing Cambodia. The 
wiretaps had nothing to do with Nixon's China initiative or peace negotiations. 
The Supreme Court later ruled that they were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon dismisses as "bizarre" and "false" charges that he "ordered massive 
illegal wiretapping and surveillance of political opponents," but in July, 
1970, Nixon approved a massive plan for political repression concocted by aide 
Tom Huston that included intensified electronic surveillance of "domestic 
security threats" and increased "mail coverage." These activities were to be 
coordinated by a new "Interagency Group." Fortunately, J. Edgar Hoover balked 
at creating a rival to his own agency. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon acknowledges that the Watergate cover-up was illegal, but blames it on 
his subordinates. "I made the inexcusable error of following the recommendation 
from some members of my staff -- some of whom, I later learned, had a personal 
stake in covering up the facts -- and requesting that the CIA intervene," Nixon 
says in trying to excuse his request that the CIA throttle the FBI 
investigation of Watergate. Nixon limits his own role to not setting "a higher 
standard for the conduct of the people who participated in my campaign and 
administration." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon frequently uses the debating technique of denying what has never been 
charged in order to evade what has already been shown. Denying any hint of 
political corruption, he writes, "No one who donated over a million dollars was 
ever appointed to any ambassadorship." What he fails to mention is that quite a 
few people who contributed somewhat less were given appointments. According to 
J. Anthony Lukas' "Nightmare," Nixon appointed 13 non-career ambassadors after 
his 1972 election who, together, contributed $706,000 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon uses a similar debating technique in discussing the use of the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) to harass political opponents. He cavalierly defends 
using the IRS against Democratic chairman Lawrence O'Brien. "I see nothing 
wrong with getting wealthy people to pay their taxes," Nixon says. But Nixon 
doesn't mention using the IRS against virtually anyone who crossed his path, 
from a Newsday editor to basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's rendition of his Vietnam policy is about as credible as his version of 
Watergate. He blames the prolongation of the war on the North Vietnamese 
"filibustering" the negotiations. Nixon omits his own role in sabotaging the 
Johnson Administration's October, 1968, peace overtures; his adamant refusal 
for four years to accept a North Vietnamese presence in the South, even though 
it was obvious they could not be dislodged; the South Vietnamese government's 
veto of the agreement finally worked out in summer, 1972, between National 
Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and the North Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon not only defends but recommends as models of decision-making the 1970 
invasion of Cambodia and the brutal and unnecessary 1972 Christmas bombing of 
Hanoi. He writes that the Cambodian invasion "saved lives and reduced the 
Communists' ability to continue their attacks on our forces," not mentioning 
that the invasion failed utterly in its main objective of unearthing and 
destroying the North Vietnamese headquarters (the infamous COSVN) supposedly 
located in Cambodia, nor that by inflaming domestic opposition, the invasion 
restricted Nixon's future options far more than it restricted North Vietnam's. 
</P>
<P>
As President, Nixon's greatest achievement was to break with the Cold War model 
of a monolithic world Communist movement. Nixon recognized that the United 
States could use the growing divisions within the Communist world to its own 
advantage by playing China off against the Soviet Union. The problem is that 
two decades later, with Communism in ruins and the Soviet Union turning inward, 
Nixon clings to the same geopolitical strategy. Nixon still believes that the 
Soviet Union remains a dangerous threat that must be parried through alliance 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
In this book, Nixon avers that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is not a 
reformer but a wily Brezhnev, seeking the same ends through more devious means. 
His musings on Gorbachev sound as though they were excerpted from a John Birch 
Society newsletter: Gorbachev's reforms "represent little more than crumbs 
which have fallen from the banquet table." Gorbachev's goal is not "to replace 
the Communist system, but to strengthen it." The Soviet army is "stronger than 
when Gorbachev came to power five years ago. . . . Gorbachev's principal 
political reform has been to concentrate more power in his own hands than any 
Soviet leader since Stalin. . . . He has not given up his support for those 
regimes besieged by anti-Communist freedom fighters." 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, Nixon insists that the Chinese are worthy and valuable 
allies against the Soviet Union. After the Tian An Men Square massacre, Nixon 
called for the Bush Administration to retain its "cooperative relationship" 
with Deng Xiaoping and China's other leaders to prevent the Soviet Union from 
creating an alliance with China against the United States. In this book, Nixon 
wildly exaggerates China's importance to American foreign policy. China, he 
writes, is "the number three political player on the world scene." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon also glosses over China's retrogression after Tian An Men Square. He 
predicts that "after some necessary retrenchment Deng's economic reforms will 
continue and . . . with them will inevitably come renewed pressure for 
political reforms." He portrays Deng and disciple Li Peng, the architects of 
the massacre, as being "reformers" and warns that an American attempt at 
"isolating China will only be grist for the mill of the reactionaries." 
</P>
<P>
In typical Nixon fashion, he refutes his critics by attributing to them 
untenable positions they do not hold. After the massacre, Nixon writes, "some 
observers called for the United States to punish China's leaders by breaking 
off all relations." China's critics, however, did not call for breaking off all 
relations but rather for suspending high-level contacts above ambassadorial 
level -- a far different and more reasonable response and one that Nixon might 
have found more difficult to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
Like Paul Nitze and Dean Acheson, Nixon was a lot smarter in office than out. 
Out of office, he has seemed determined to prove his conservative credentials 
-- even positioning himself in 1987 on Ronald Reagan's right by opposing the 
manifestly benign INF treaty. He also seems driven by a need to justify his 
continuing close relations with China's leaders and his questionable role in 
persuading the Bush Administration to take a conciliatory posture after Tian An 
Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is so obsessed with Cold War geopolitics that he barely mentions the 
global issues that will dominate American foreign policy in the next two 
decades. Nixon has only the foggiest notion of international economics. He 
devotes a single sentence to economic conflicts with Japan. Many of our trade 
disputes, Nixon declares, have been "politically potent" but "economically 
petty." If anything, the exact reverse has been the case: The disputes have had 
little effect politically, but have had enormous repercussions on key American 
industries like semiconductors and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
There are sensible and interesting sections in this book. In chapters on 
temperance, recreation, public speaking or privacy, Nixon offers Dale 
Carnegie-like advice to the young about how to succeed in politics. Nixon also 
can display a commendable realism in rejecting proposals for total disarmament 
or world government. But just as Nixon's greatest achievements as President 
were overshadowed by his darker side, the virtues of this book are dwarfed by 
its vices.

"Whenever he writes something, chaos ensues." The complaint is registered by a 
distressed bureaucrat who has fallen victim to the expose journalism of China's 
most widely read and respected author, Liu Binyan. 
</P>
<P>
Liu, presently in exile in the West, has been an "investigative reporter" in a 
country where that phrase is close to an oxymoron. In the People's Republic of 
China, journalists know that the word propaganda has no negative connotation, 
at least not in officialdom. Censorship is taken for granted. "The press should 
unconditionally propagate the party line and policy and should perform the role 
of the prty's spokesmen," central committee directives unblushingly dictate. 
</P>
<P>
When Fox Butterfield went to Beijing as correspondent for the New York Times in 
1979, the Chinese were baffled to find that he had a room in the Peking Hotel. 
"Why don't you live in the American Embassy?" they asked him, unwilling to 
believe that the New York Times was not part of the American government. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Chinese newspapers lack credibility. In a survey taken by one 
newspaper -- published in the relatively open atmosphere of the mid-'80s -- 
readers agreed almost unanimously that the most useful information in the print 
media was the weather forecast. About 10 years ago, the nation's editors 
addressed the public's complaints of distrust of, and near-terminal boredom 
with, the daily fare of happy news about soybean crops and socialist rectitude. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a flurry of stories highlighting strange phenomena, articles 
that were designed to please readers without offending censors. There were 
reports of a mermaid, of Chinese children who could read with their armpits, 
and of tall, hairy primates who built campfires and knew how to weave bamboo. 
</P>
<P>
More important, a genre of writing known as "literary reportage" (baogao 
wenxue) was inaugurated. And with the blessing of the party a small coterie of 
muckraking reporters was commissioned to uncover corruption in high places. It 
was here, beginning in 1979, that Liu Binyan was to make his mark as a writer 
for the People's Daily, the nation's and the party's flagship newspaper and his 
entree to institutions everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It is not so strange that the party would encourage tough investigative 
reporting. In addition to revitalizing popular interest in the official press, 
it would demonstrate that the leadership cared. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping 
possessed only a shaky control over a bureaucracy that was still riddled with 
Maoist ideologues and other holdovers of the Cultural Revolution era. Deng's 
new power base would be strengthened in direct proportion to the unmasking of 
these retrograde elements. Naturally, however, exposing shortcomings in the 
system must not be confused with criticizing the system itself. 
</P>
<P>
But who could be more reliable than Liu Binyan? Liu was at once an ardent party 
man and a long-suffering victim of Maoist excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1925, Liu was still a teen-ager when he began printing and distributing 
anti-Japanese leaflets in occupied China. At 20, he was accepted into the 
party, where his writing talents were soon recognized. 
</P>
<P>
In 1955, at age 30, he was attacked for the first time by the literary 
watchdogs of the party. He survived, but in 1957, during Mao's "Hundred 
Flowers" campaign, launched to encourage greater freedom of expression, Liu's 
writings were found to "exaggerate" the party's defects. He had gone too far, 
crossed the line and produced "poisonous weeds" instead of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Labeled a rightist counterrevolutionary and expelled from the party, Liu 
entered a 22-year period of internal exile and forced labor. "I had been at the 
height of popularity, considered a 'vanguard' of our age," he writes. And then, 
"overnight, I became the detested 'enemy of the people.' " 
</P>
<P>
From 32 years old until 54, he was not allowed to write. Compared to those who 
were tortured or sentenced to long jail terms or hounded to death, "I was 
lucky," he says. Still, there was tedious and exhausting manual labor, dragging 
660-pound night-soil carts from city to countryside. And there was the endless 
humiliation of self-criticism sessions, and separation from his wife and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other intellectuals, Liu was rehabilitated, returned to his 
profession and to the good graces of the party after Deng Xiaoping's rise to 
power. The lost decades of his life did not jar his faith in Marxist ideals, 
and in 1979, Liu was once again championing the cause of the wronged and 
helpless. 
</P>
<P>
His "People or Monsters?" which appeared in the September, 1979, issue of 
People's Literature documented the corrupt machinations of party cadres in 
Binxian County near Harbin in the northeast. "The party controls everything; 
the only thing it does not control is itself," Liu wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The article brought down a squalid dynasty of local power holders who had been 
immune from criticism for 34 years. Reprinted and broadcast on the radio 
throughout the country, Liu's story created a sensation. Letters poured into 
his office saying, "You write about Binxian, but the same thing is happening 
right here where we are!" 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the early 1980s, Liu became a kind of one-man journalistic ombudsman 
settling scores for victims of the system. Long lines of petitioners crowded 
the entrance to greet him at the People's Daily each morning, and besieged his 
apartment in the evening. Approximately half of "A Higher Kind of Loyalty" is a 
riveting case-by-case narrative of Liu's investigations of the petty and 
not-so-petty tyrants, profiteers, embezzlers, confidence men and zealots, who 
represent the seamy side of China's socialist elite. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cases involve bureaucratic venality that gives extended meaning to 
Orwell's "1984." When a corrupt band of provincial party leaders could not 
silence the criticisms of a certain Wang Fumian, and could not make criminal 
charges against him stick, they had him put away in a mental institution for 
life. Liu interviewed Wang, found him both sane and logical, and discovered 
that he had been diagnosed as suffering from "mania" by a panel of physicians 
led by a veterinarian turned psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, it was the provincial Security Bureau that provided guidelines for 
the medical board. In its "Criteria for Diagnosing Mental Diseases," mania was 
defined as a "rare kind of mental disease." Its symptoms: "overconfidence, 
extreme willfulness, found mostly in people of advanced cultural background. . 
. . Taken for normal at an early age, the patient gradually asserts his (her) 
willpower more and more forcibly, (and) he (she) rushes about offering 
petitions, writing endless letters of accusation." This is the exact language 
that the party had used for years to condemn anyone with "independent 
thinking," Liu notes. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the author observes, the political climate of China is uncertain -- 
"sunshine one day, rain the next" -- and Liu's career seems to be an all too 
reliable barometer of the changing weather. In 1987, Liu was again accused of 
going too far, or promoting chaos. More specifically, hard-line party officials 
charged him with helping to inspire student protests. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, he was dismissed from the Party. This time, the results were not 
personally so destructive to Liu. When Harvard University offered him a Nieman 
fellowship in 1988, Liu was able to accept it -- "thanks to the persuasiveness 
of Harrison Salisbury" is all that he says by way of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every page of this moving book expresses the moral fervor of Liu Binyan 
and the gradual erosion of "one kind of loyalty" that had been misplaced in his 
youth. "My generation has thrown itself into the struggle led by the Communist 
Party," Liu concludes, "in the hope that our children will lead a better life, 
and now it is precisely the best and brightest of their generation who had died 
at the butcher's hands, or are fugitives fleeing from arrest."

LEGACIES A CHINESE MOSAIC BY BETTE BAO LORD (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 245 PP)

Odyssey of a Revolutionary Chinese Woman (University of California Press).

<TEXT>
<P>
China captured the attention of the world last spring when foreign journalists 
and camera crews assigned to cover the historic meeting between Mikhail 
Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping witnessed an even more historic confrontation 
between the Chinese people and their aged leaders. For weeks, Western viewers 
watched anxiously, riveted by the televised spectacle of youthful hunger 
strikers lying prostrate in Tian An Men Square, of army troops immobilized by 
outraged citizens, and finally of a lone man in a white shirt attempting to 
halt an advancing tank. 
</P>
<P>
Among the shocked viewers of the Democracy Movement's final brutal suppression 
was novelist Bette Bao Lord, who had left Beijing just four days earlier. Mrs. 
Lord had been awaiting the chance, after three-and-a-half years engaged in the 
diplomatic duties of the American ambassador's wife, to begin writing. She 
wanted to "piece together the puzzle" and make sense of the searing experiences 
recounted by an array of friends and informants. She also wanted to unravel the 
contradictions apparent in her own "China Passage." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, her attempt to penetrate the experience of contemporary China also was 
the quest for her own roots, the tracing of a road not taken. After an absence 
of 27 years, she found to her astonishment "a kinship that binds inalterably." 
Thus began an intensely personal search for the life she might have led had she 
not left Shanghai with her parents in 1946 at age 8, to attend primary school 
in Brooklyn and later marrying her tall, blue-eyed classmate at the Fletcher 
School of Diplomacy. Throughout her stay in China, even on the final drive to 
the airport, she would peer into crowds, "searching for a woman around 50 years 
of age, not tall, not short, not stout, not slender: me." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, after June 4, the compiling of this already engrossing collective 
biography acquired a new focus and a new urgency. Perceptions shifted 
dramatically after the Communist Party, in the most brutal public gesture of 
its 40-year rule, ordered the People's Army -- once the agent of the nation's 
deliverance -- to open fire upon a stunned and outraged populace. 
</P>
<P>
The Deng Xiaoping government had repeatedly encouraged the belief that "leftist 
mistakes" would not again be tolerated in the reformist era that followed the 
Cultural Revolution. But when the leaders' personal power was threatened, the 
excessive violence all too familiar from the Maoist years resumed with a 
vengeance. For Bao Lord as for all Chinese intellectuals, earlier instances of 
cruelty and repression assumed a startling retrospective continuity. 
</P>
<P>
Alone among the proliferating accounts of the Democracy Movement, this moving 
narrative locates China's most recent tragedy in the context of individual 
experience. Fresh from two months as a special consultant to CBS News, Bao Lord 
takes us on a compelling journey into China's personal past to discover the 
wellspring of the Beijing spring. "Legacies: A Chinese Mosaic" weaves an 
intricate tapestry, drawing together painful memories of earlier 
disillusionment with the renewed sense of betrayal and hopelessness in the 
present. Evocatively written, laced with wit and bitter humor, terrifying in 
their candor, her stories of broken lives reveal the human consequences of 
China's once glorious effort to usher in a bright socialist future. 
</P>
<P>
The style of "Legacies" is novel and daring. Headnotes to each chapter 
chronicle the major events of 1989, forcing the collision of past and present. 
The juxtapositions are unsettling, as are the antiphonal voices. A description 
of the events of April 27, for example, when huge demonstrations surged past 
police lines in central Beijing to proclaim the patriotic intent of the student 
movement, is followed by the testimony of "The Joker." 
</P>
<P>
"With repetition," remarks this self-styled expert on farces, "even the most 
tragic of circumstances can be reduced to absurdity." Stronger and more 
talented than his high school classmates, he tried repeatedly to clamber up the 
ladder but met only humiliation and harassment, beginning with his 
revolutionary decision in 1967 to flee to North Korea, just when others were 
escaping to Hong Kong and Burma. "At age 19, I had taken in everything that I 
had been taught. Kim Il Sung was truly a beloved father. His was my promised 
land." Nine years in jail followed, but still he remained optimistic. It took 
20 years as a free man for him to appreciate the comparative peace and safety 
of a prison. 
</P>
<P>
Another chapter opens with Zhao Ziyang's pre-dawn visit to hospitalized hunger 
strikers on May 18, before turning to the experiences of "The White Dog." This 
senior physician, trained in an American missionary school, had welcomed the 
Red Army, hadf worked selflessly for the promised new society, and had been 
voted a model doctor until the Cultural Revolution, when he was imprisoned as a 
spy. 
</P>
<P>
From the sidelines he "witnessed the political turmoil that engulfed the 
hospital . . . (a) hypnotic fervor so primitive, so extreme, that it seemed to 
me as if China had reverted to a time when the nation was not yet civilized." 
The saga of his beatings and temporary madness, of his mother's death after the 
depredations of the Red Guards and his father's suicide, affords a devastating 
glimpse of the treatment of China's medical profession during the years when 
politics took command. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of the Cultural Revolution runs like a threnody throughout these 
vignettes. Almost zealously, Bao Lord presents the experience of victims as 
well as perpetrators in an effort to fathom the ordeal of the cataclysmic 
decade from 1966 to 1976. Clearly many within China shared her concern and 
entrusted their lives to her pen. On their behalf, she could achieve, they 
believed, the crucial task of remembrance that would help to prevent the 
mindless political struggles of the past from returning. Even in early 1989, no 
one could foresee the next convulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Bao Lord's Chinese mosaic, however, contains not just despair but the seeds of 
hope. It describes not just loss but also meaning deeply felt, not just failure 
but a stirring record of dedication, endurance and even happiness. 
</P>
<P>
It is on such a note that "Legacies" closes. A few months before leaving, Bao 
Lord had received a visitor who brought a gift wrapped with string and 
newsprint. His offering, he apologized, was worthless, yet also priceless. 
Inside she found the threadbare blanket cover, carefully laundered and mended, 
that had warmed the young man for 10 years in prison. "I want you to have this 
coverlet," he explained, "to remind you that no matter what the future may hold 
for me, even then I knew happiness." 
</P>
<P>
One leaves this remarkable narrative wondering what the future will hold for 
all those whose hopes were once again shattered on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor who brought the coverlet to Bette Bao Lord later managed to 
smuggle a cassette to her in the United States. Its closing words were: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"I can't seem to think things through. Here I am thirty-nine years old and I 
can't think things through. Even before last spring my work had never gone 
smoothly, but now that the arts have been placed under the Ministry of 
Propaganda again, the prospect is bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is it always the arts that suffer? After forty years of Communism, why has 
China, whose culture is replete with great men of letters, not produced a 
first-class writer? How stupid of me to want to work in this field. 
Contradictions, more contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
"The same goes for reforms. To implement them, one must have power. But China 
governed loosely is chaotic and China governed without democracy cannot 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think it through. All my life, it seems, I haven't thought it through. 
I guess this is my fate. Besides ranting at the gods, what can one do? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to receive your calls more often, but as the time of our separation 
lengthens and our lives change in opposite ways, can we still talk as easily 
and as profoundly as once we did? 
</P>
<P>
"I wish you good books. I wish your parents excellent health. I wish your 
husband happiness in his work. What else can I wish? 
</P>
<P>
"You are of another world."

WOMEN THROWN TO EARTH; 
</P>
<P>
FALLING ANGELS BY BARBARA GOWDY (SOHO PRESS: $18.95; 208 PP.; 0-939149-35-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lisa Zeidner, Zeidner's third novel, Limited Partnerships (North Point 
Press), was published last year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mary Field hurls herself from the roof of her house in 1969, she doesn't 
abandon much of a life. Mary hasn't been the same since she was acquitted of 
hurling her firstborn infant son into Niagara Falls in 1948. Since then, 
alcoholism has prevented her from doing much except watching TV in her bathrobe 
and curlers -- she even devours the test patterns. Once a year, on Christmas, 
she leaves the house. 
</P>
<P>
Mary's three daughters are thus left to rear themselves, with occasional 
interference from their violent father, a traveling salesman, when losing a 
mistress sours his mood. "Leave It to Beaver" this suburban Toronto family is 
decidedly not. But then, unlike TV shows, novels always have loved unhappy 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"Falling Angels," Canadian writer Barbara Gowdy's richly imagined second novel 
(her first was a historical romance), concerns the daughters' different 
responses to life in a house "like a dangerous country." Norma, Lou and Sandy 
-- 10, 9 and 8 respectively in the early scenes, completing high school at the 
time of their mother's suicide -- are the falling angels of the title, clinging 
to innocence and trust despite their less-than-heavenly childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Silent Norma gains weight (her jeering classmates call her "Enorma") and turns 
to God, then to lesbianism. Lou, the most rebellious, poses as a delinquent but 
studies hard on the sly, because "no one expects her to be smart." Sandy, the 
baby, develops a taste for older, married men until identical twins who are 
"into swinging" -- this is 1967, after all -- scare her into the arms of a boy 
on the football team, and an unplanned pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Handled badly, such material risks cliche. We've seen enough '50s melodramas 
about bad girls from broken homes becoming prematurely fallen women in cheap 
motels. What rescues Gowdy from this trap -- the Field girls too, for that 
matter -- is humor. Lou is fond of declarations such as "Considering our 
upbringing, it's amazing one of us is normal." Even brooding Norma is bestowed 
with wry insights: She "thought of her breasts as intelligent life with insane, 
disgusting ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
The novel's strongest section is a comic nightmare called "Disneyland -- 1961," 
which appeared in last year's "Best American Short Stories." Instead of the 
promised vacation to Disneyland, Jim Field takes his family for a two-week 
trial run in their newly constructed bomb shelter. He brings his trusty guide 
("Pioneers of Self-Defense"), some Life magazines, canned food and three cases 
of whiskey -- which the girls need as desperately as do their parents, 
especially after the water supply runs out. But Jim is determined to stay the 
full two weeks: "As adults, the girls agreed that if one of them had a burst 
appendix, he would have tried to treat her himself with his hunting knife and 
Bactine." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men that the Field girls encounter are as capricious and cruel as 
their father. Gowdy structures "Fallen Angels" as a series of the girls' 
escapes from these threats. The kindly old man with a Santa Claus beard who 
helps the girls when they run away from home turns out to be a child molester; 
the married men who call Sandy "doll" and take her for rides in their shiny 
cars all are menacing. 
</P>
<P>
Gowdy's relative inexperience as a writer shows in her method for tying the 
pieces of her chronology together. The images of falling, heaven and angels 
threaded through the narrative often seem too heavy-handed and artificial a way 
to gain narrative cohesion. Written in short sections and short, simple 
sentences, with frequent changes of tense, the episodes often feel episodic. 
Especially in the sections told from the girls' childhood points of view, Gowdy 
doesn't quite achieve the guileless lyricism for which she aims. 
</P>
<P>
But this novel, unlike many others, gets better as it progresses. These 
characters clearly grew on Gowdy as they grew up and developed habits, hobbies 
and fantasies. In the first chapters, a reader may barely be able to tell the 
Field girls apart; by novel's end, they're firmly and movingly differentiated, 
each with her own method for accommodating hardship and disappointment.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: MAIN LINE WASP BY W. THACHER LONGSTRETH WITH DAN 
ROTTENBERG (W.W. NORTON: $19.95; 310 PP.)

<P>
Some biographies are instructive not so much because of the particular 
achievements of the subject but because the subject represents a type or class. 
Thacher Longstreth acknowledges his representative importance by calling his 
autobiography not "My Life" but "Main Line WASP." 
</P>
<P>
The autobiography of the Princeton All-American football player turned top Life 
magazine salesman and contender for the mayorship of Philadelphia defines the 
stereotype of WASP, and while his title clearly states the fact, not all of it 
can possibly be conscious. A photograph of the young Longstreth with his bride 
in 1941, strategically paired with a shot taken on their return to the very 
same spot in 1966, attest to the graceful aging of the strong WASP bone 
structure -- aided, it is subtly implied in the book, by honest living. 
</P>
<P>
WASPs may play the wimp (the terrible epithet George Bush had to live down in 
his presidential campaign), but they know how to play it to uncanny advantage. 
Longstreth tells the story of a rival who applied all sorts of unflattering 
epithets to him, the least of which was ineffectual. Longstreth, when contacted 
by the Philadelphia Inquirer to respond, admitted that he had failed his 
colleague in a certain matter, and that the man had every right to be 
disappointed. Asked by the Inquirer whether the language in which the colleague 
expressed his disappointment was not a little strong, Longstreth replied, for 
publication: "No. Ed and I have been friends for a long time, and we'll be 
friends for a long time to come. There's nothing to be upset about." 
</P>
<P>
The bad-mouther was on the phone to Longstreth as soon as the article appeared. 
"Goddammit, you have me so embarrassed," he complained. "My wife is so angry at 
me. All of a sudden you're the good guy and I'm the villain. You've taught me a 
lesson, Thacher. I'm never going to say a mean word publicly about anyone 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Take this species of killer-innocence (notice the charitable inclusion of the 
rival's promise never to sin again), coupled with the absolute confidence that 
comes from belonging to a strong network of like individuals, and the nice-guy 
approach can be wielded like a club. Longstreth's colorful stories of business 
and politics, including the tale of his unintended selection as middleman 
between Philadelphia Teamsters and Jimmy Hoffa, make enlightening reading, and 
belie his contention that the WASP's day was over in the 1930s. Sonja Bolle

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: ROCK HUDSON FRIEND OF MINE BY TOM CLARK WITH DICK KLEINER 
(PHAROS BOOKS: $18.95; 276 PP.)

In 1964, Tom Clark met Rock Hudson at a bridge game at the home of a mutual 
friend. Clark, who at the time was a publicist at MGM, had met and worked with 
a number of top stars and so he was not daunted by this first encounter with 
Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hudson's own posthumous autobiography ("Rock Hudson: His Story," 
actually written by Sara Davidson although Hudson initiated the project in 1985 
when he was near death), the two men grew close and eventually became lovers. 
In 1973, Clark moved into Hudson's home, where he lived until 1983, and he 
later returned to help care for Hudson in the months before the movie star died 
of AIDS-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Now Clark has written his own book about their life together, but anyone 
expecting a great love story will be sorely disappointed. Clark's book is more 
that of a publicist than of an intimate. 
</P>
<P>
He writes about the fabulous parties they gave, the trips they took and the 
famous people they met. There are anecdotes aplenty. Clark portrays Hudson as a 
somewhat innocent, friendly and sincere man who needed guidance, from someone 
savvy like Clark, in both his personal and business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark never acknowledges that their relationship went beyond being 
roommates and business associates. It's an odd fact, given that their alleged 
relationship was revealed in some detail in the Hudson-Davidson book. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a missed opportunity. Hudson, who won only occasional accolades for 
his acting, was one of the major sex symbols of Hollywood. If word had gotten 
out to the public during his working years that he was a gay man, it surely 
would have scuttled his career. Clark could have given us a fascinating 
insider's view of this kind of secretive arrangement and the conflicting 
emotions that must have gone along with it. At the least, he could have 
acknowledged that side of Hudson's life and explain why he didn't want to write 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock Hudson: Friend of Mine" is not a completely gentle book -- Clark strikes 
out with a vengeance at those who he feels misused Hudson. But it is a shallow 
one. David Colker

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: WOMEN WHO WRITE BY LUCINDA IRWIN SMITH (JULIAN

Opening under Anais Nin's succinct quote -- "The role of the writer is not to 
say what we can all say but what we are unable to say" -- "Women Who Write" is 
intended as a how-to cum inspirational guide for young readers, presumably 
young female readers. The main section of the book is devoted to authors from 
Jane Austen and George Eliot to Carolyn See and Tama Janowitz. 
</P>
<P>
Lucinda Irwin Smith presents the contemporary authors in interview form; her 
selection, though obviously limited, is most imaginative and diverse, including 
poet Denise Levertov, young adult novelist Norma Klein and Lorraine Vivian 
Hansberry, the first black woman to have a play produced on Broadway ("A Raisin 
in the Sun"). "Women Who Write" closes with a section addressing readers as 
future writers and offering them ideas on "Developing Your Gift." Although the 
book's earnest, wholesome tone occasionally betrays textbook intentions -- 
particularly in the chapters on authors on the wrong side of the grave for 
interview purposes -- it would certainly be an inspired choice for classroom 
use. Sonja Bolle

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: STEINLEN'S CATS BY FRANCOIS FOSSIER (ABRAMS: $14.95)

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
Although a relatively obscure figure today, Theophile-Alexandre Steinlen 
(1859-1923) was one of the most popular poster and graphic artists in belle 
eepoque Paris. 
</P>
<P>
He obviously adored cats, and depicted their every mood, capturing the gloss of 
a sleek coat, the extension of a stretch or the sensual luxury of a pose in a 
few sensitive lines or brush strokes. His realistic lithographs are 
exceptionally tactile, while the glowering, stylized feline on his famous 
poster for Rudolph Salis' Chat Noir cabaret must rank as the ultimate Halloween 
cat. An ideal gift for a cat lover.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE GIFT OF STONES BY JIM CRACE (COLLIER: $7.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this beautifully polished short novel, Jim Crace re-creates the last days of 
a Neolithic village, whose inhabitants earn their livelihoods by chipping 
flints into blades for tools and weapons. The misfit in their rigidly 
circumscribed world is the narrator's stepfather, barred from a life of working 
the brittle stone by the amputation of his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
He learns to fashion words instead, shaping tales with the care and skill that 
his relatives reserve for their most delicately edged blades. The struggle of 
the one-armed storyteller for existence becomes a rumination on the need for 
art in an otherwise mundane existence. Crace's evocation of the dark, fearful 
Neolithic world is far removed from the Jung-at-heart hokum of "The Clan of the 
Cave Bear"; "The Gift of Stones" is a deceptively simple book that explores 
profound ideas with a rare delicacy of touch.

POP FACES: THE JUNGLE BROTHERS ADDRESS GROOVY TOPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jungle Brothers are leaders of the Positive Rap movement -- a bouillabaisse 
of peace and love and learned Afrocentricity built around a musical eclecticism 
that includes sampled disco, calypso, Archie Shepp -- anything but the James 
Brown stuff you'll find on any other hip-hop record. It's all blended smooth, 
like they wish the world would be. 
</P>
<P>
"We unite the music, and people like it," says Jungle Brother Mike G., putting 
his feet up on a table in a record-company conference room in Burbank. "So why 
can't we unite the people too?" 
</P>
<P>
Their confederates, a quasi-formal New York hip-hop community the JBs call "The 
Tribe," include rap stars De La Soul, Queen Latifah and Tribe Called Quest, all 
known for positive outlooks and dance-floor jams. 
</P>
<P>
The JBs, whose debut "Straight Out the Jungle," on the tiny Idler label, was 
the underground rap smash of '88, were the first of The Tribe to break big. 
Ironically, their hard-core attitude and street-savvy beats influenced the 
gangster rap of N.W.A no less than it did the good-vibin' De La Soul. 
</P>
<P>
"Hip-hop reflects life," says group leader Afrika Baby Bambaataa, "and there 
are enough negative things out there to support an N.W.A or a Too ort. Police 
are doing what they do; some brothers, unfortunately, are doing what they do. 
We're trying to provide a balance to that." 
</P>
<P>
On their major-label debut, "Done By the Forces of Nature" on Warner Bros., the 
Jungle Brothers address such groovy topics as sunshine, mother nature, black 
beauty, and the concept of AfriKa. Any coincidence between the JBs' music and 
the early cosmic meanderings of funkmeister George Clinton is purely 
intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"We see De La Soul as the Parliament to our Funkadelic," Afrika says, "where 
one group is commercial and the other -- us -- is down and funky. De La and us 
are both known for the same things. We were all born in the '70s, and we think 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," concurs Mike G. "The city's the jungle and we're the brothers."

Not only arguably the worst rock 'n' roll movie of all time, but easily the 
worst Joe Eszterhas screenplay ever -- what better recommendation could a 
slap-happy masochist need for a hoot-filled night around the video camp "Fire"? 
If Bob Dylan is slightly credible as a washed-up rocker, try to picture blank, 
tuneless Rupert Everett as a Time magazine cover superstar whose awful 
techno-pop inspires New Kids-like hysteria, or Fiona as the 18-year-old airhead 
discovery -- coveted by them both -- who, magically, draws screaming sellout 
crowds to her very first concerts. Dylan gamely enunciates his lines but it's 
clear from his dazed look that he already realized what an incalculably 
embarrassing career choice he'd made. CHRIS WILLMAN

Young may not sing for Miller or for Bud, but he apparently doesn't have any 
reservations about lending his music and name to lazy-concept videos. Instead 
of an original or even definitive showcase of the music from last year's highly 
acclaimed "Freedom" album, this modest 30-minute package features 
straightforward footage of Young performing seven songs, ranging from his old 
"Ohio" to the recent album's "Too Far Gone." Some of the acoustic performances 
are gripping, but there's generally far too low a yield to make this a 
satisfying work. ROBERT HILBURN

ART WORLD: REDRAWING THE ART MUSEUM VISITOR PROFILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Q &amp; A: Art and Attendance 
</P>
<P>
New art patrons of the next decade and how Southern California museums will 
attract them is the focus of "Drawing Audiences," a half-hour KCET documentary 
that will air Friday at 9 p.m. on Channel 28 (with repeats Saturday at 5 p.m. 
and May 7 at 7:30 p.m.). In making the documentary -- which includes 
discussions with museum directors such as Earl A. (Rusty) Powell of the L.A. 
County Museum of Art and John Walsh of the J. Paul Getty Museum -- producers 
found that 89% of current Southland museum supporters are older than 56 and 
that 93% of all L.A. museum visitors are Anglo. To gain some insight into local 
museums' strategies for changing these statistics, Art World talked with 
Celeste Durant, executive producer of "Drawing Audiences." 
</P>
<P>
Question: What does it mean to Los Angeles' museums to have visitors that are 
predominantly white and older than 56? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If the museums are going to continue to be a vital part of the 
community . . . it's going to be critical for them to attract (an ethnically) 
diverse audience. Especially if they're going to engage patronage as well as 
attendance, they've got to engage the people that are living here. Also, to 
have a future audience, you have to attract younger people. you have to let 
them know that art is a vital part of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you see as the factors that have shaped this current audience? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's been historical. It was the way that Los Angeles developed -- the 
people that brought art and were concerned about art were predominantly white. 
And it's continued that way, even though other people now live here. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who are the new audiences that the museums are trying to reach, and what are 
they doing to attract them? 
</P>
<P>
A: From the interviews that we did, especially in terms of the Getty, they're 
really looking to attract a younger audience. One of their biggest programs is 
a special program geared toward parents and children learning about art 
together. They're really trying to get to them and teach them about art while 
they're young. If you get to school children while they're young, you're going 
to have a more multi-ethnic base. Also, they're doing interactive exhibits . . 
. and taped presentations making the whole world of art more accessible. That 
way they will encourage people who like art but aren't particularly well versed 
in it, to go (to a museum) -- and to go more than once, to begin to integrate 
art into their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kind of problems do you think the museums will face in reaching this 
audience? 
</P>
<P>
A: A good part of it will just be reaching out to the communities that they 
want to encourage. For instance, the Getty is doing advertising geared toward 
the Hispanic community. Another approach they're going to have to take is to 
increase the ethnic nature of their collections and their exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Through what you've seen in putting together this documentary, can Los 
Angeles' museums survive if they continue to attract only the audiences they 
now have? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're really going to have to attract a younger audience. The audiences 
that they've been attracting are getting increasingly older, so they're not 
going to be there (in the future). (And as far as attracting a more ethnically 
diverse audience), it's essential, because the Anglo community is becoming the 
minority community. They'll have to attract (ethnically diverse) communities to 
tap both the interest and the financial support they need. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Museum's recent purchase of "Irises" isn't the only Southern 
California contribution to the Vincent van Gogh centennial. The Norton Simon 
Museum has mounted its own tribute with "Vincent Van Gogh: Painter, Printmaker, 
and Collector," which will be on display through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a rare opportunity to see the work of a great artist from his 
early years to his later flowering -- especially in the United States," said 
curator Lanier Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Featured in the exhibition are six of Van Gogh's paintings, including 
"spectacularly colored late ones" such as "The Mulberry Tree" (1889) and 
"Portrait of Dr. Gachet" (1890), as well as "some of the dark early ones" 
including "Head of a Peasant Woman in a White Bonnet "(1885) which depicts Sien 
de Groot, a woman who later appears in the artist's famous "Potato Eaters" 
(1885). 
</P>
<P>
But Graham noted that the exhibition -- which includes a drawing, an etching 
and one of the artist's last letters -- does not end with Van Gogh's own works. 
Also featured are four Hiroshige prints and a painting by Adolphe Monticelli 
that were collected by Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
"We added these to add some insight and understanding of his work," Graham 
said, noting that Monticelli was "the only painter Van Gogh himself ever 
collected," and that the exhibition explores "the relationship between the 
(Hiroshige) prints and (Van Gogh's) own paintings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my god, they look like aliens! I wouldn't want to come in here after dark 
-- I'd have nightmares all night long!" said a college-aged woman with long 
dark hair speaking to her blue-jean clad friend while looking at paintings in 
the L.A. County Museum of Art's "Francis Bacon" retrospective during its final 
days on view. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
A cast steel sculpture formed of materials from the ruins of last October's San 
Francisco earthquake is included in "Oakland's Artists '90," which runs through 
July 1 at the Oakland Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"This piece is in tribute to my community of West Oakland. . . . I wanted to 
celebrate the living, my neighbors who risked their lives to help those trapped 
on the Cypress structure," said sculptor Bruce Beasley of his "The Pillars of 
Cypress," which is made of scrap from the demolished Nimitz freeway Cypress 
Street overpass. 
</P>
<P>
Beasley, who himself worked a 10-hour volunteer shift to help shore up the

The annual Awards in the Visual Arts program is alive and well despite all the 
hoopla over last year's inclusion of Andres Serrano's controversial work "Piss 
Christ." This year's AVA exhibition -- which features 10 artists from across 
the country -- premiere's Saturday at the New Orleans Museum of Art, where it 
will be on view through July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The AVA winners, who will receive $15,000 each, include Santa Barbara-based 
conceptual sculptor Ann Hamilton (who currently has a show at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art) and Oakland-based painter Raymond Saunders. Other 
winners are Mike Glier of Hoosick Falls, N.Y. and Randy Twaddle of Houston, 
both of whom do drawings; photographers Lorna Simpson of Brooklyn and Sally 
Mann of Lexington, Va.; and sculptors Lisa Hoke of New York, Martin Emmanuel of 
Atlanta, Tony Tasset of Chicago and Malcolm Cochran of Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The AVA program, which is administered by the Southeastern Center for 
Contemporary Art (SECCA) in Winston-Salem, N.C., aims at bringing recognition 
to talented artists early on in their careers and to affirm that serious, 
accomplished art can be created anywhere an artist chooses to live and work. 
</P>
<P>
After the New Orleans Museum of Art, the show will travel to SECCA (Aug. 4-Oct. 
7), Harvard University's Arthur M. Sackler Museum (Nov. 23-Jan. 13, 1991), and 
New York's BMW Gallery (April 1991-September 1991). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEBUTS 
</P>
<P>
Austrian artist Eva Schlegel makes her Los Angeles debut at Shoshana Wayne 
Gallery with a show of abstract paintings on plaster and photographs 
silk-screened on glass. Schlegel lives and works in Vienna and has exhibited 
extensively in Europe. Her show opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Also opening Saturday is the first one-man show in Los Angeles by Nayland 
Blake. Blake's work, "Punch Agonistes," deals with issues of sexual repression, 
expression and deviation, as well as dominant cultural myths of the 19th and 
20th centuries. Blake was recently included in the San Francisco Museum of 
Modern Art's "New Work: A New Generation." 
</P>
<P>
French painter Philippe Judlin makes his West Coast debut at Feingarten 
Galleries through May 30. Judlin is part of a young movement in France that 
derives its inspiration from l'Art Brut, which shares an awareness of 
non-academic sources of art such as tribal, native and folk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HAPPENING 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen important American works that will be auctioned in New York May 23 by

THE EARLY GARBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after Greta Garbo's death (April 15) I came across a batch of Garbo 
photographs covering 1926 to 1932. One brought back memories of an evening at 
the old 60 Club, before it became the Mayfair. 
</P>
<P>
The 60 had a membership of most of the stars and industry personalities and was 
regarded as veddy veddy. 
</P>
<P>
One of those present was famed actor John Gilbert, who had a nondescript young 
woman with him. Some knew her, but as many others were doubtful . . . "some 
foreign actress out at Metro." 
</P>
<P>
She didn't speak much and didn't dance with Gilbert, who was trying to talk her 
into getting up on the floor with him. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed too that she was clad in what was undoubtedly the drabbest dress in 
the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
I learned later that she didn't own a gown and had borrowed one from the Metro 
studio wardrobe department. Later too I learned that she was still grieving 
over the death of her Swedish mentor -- Mauritz Stiller, who had brought her to 
Hollywood -- and only reluctantly had she consented to Gilbert's pleas to join 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody there -- in what amounted to a phantasmagoria of beauty and glamour -- 
could visualize that this ugly duckling would in time be one of the most famous 
women in the world.

ART NOTEBOOK: 'PARADISE OASIS REAL ESTATE OFFICE' SEES ARTIFICE OF GREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISBET NILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With real estate so central to the California experience these days, it seems 
only natural that art should grapple with the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
In an installation titled "Paradise Oasis Real Estate Office" at SPARC, German 
artist Christel Dillbohner; her husband, Gero Leson, an environmental 
consultant, and three American friends take a semidocumentary look at the 
ill-fated master-planned community California City. 
</P>
<P>
Aggressively marketed as a dream location for real estate investment in the 
1960s, the 90,000-lot private development languishes north of Los Angeles on 
100,000 still-arid acres of Mojave Desert. Its current population is about 
7,200, the artists said. 
</P>
<P>
Using collage, photography, video, documentary displays and a full-scale 
composite of a vaguely seedy real estate office -- complete down to the 
business cards -- that takes up one end of the SPARC gallery, Dillbohner and 
friends set out to explore some of the fundamental dreams, contradictions and 
ironies of American society as manifest in the profit-driven booms and busts of 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Leson first came upon California City three years ago, when he got lost in a 
maze of dirt roads that led nowhere while on a drive to Red Rock Canyon. He and 
Dillbohner became fascinated with the sparsely inhabited settlement and its 
historic analogies to the headlong development of Los Angeles and the San 
Fernando Valley. Dillbohner said they were also intrigued by "the American 
dream to own real estate and make fast and easy money -- and how that's taken 
advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
? As foreigners, Leson said, he and Dillbohner were surprised to see the birth 
of such a large-scale community left entirely to private developers. "It's a 
form of development you don't find much in Europe, where there are more 
stringent government controls and less availability of space," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dillbohner said, "And people still fall for the dream -- nothing has really 
changed." Indeed, with prices for homes there in the $70,000 range, and lot 
prices one-third that and less, according to the exhibition, California City 
could look positively alluring to Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paradise Oasis Real Estate Office, a Parable for the American Dream," through 
May 27 at the SPARC Gallery, 685 Venice Blvd., Venice. (213) 822-9560. Open 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. Artists' 
lecture on the exhibition at 11 a.m. May 19. 
</P>
<P>
BURKHARDT REDUX: Jack Rutberg Fine Arts is extending through May its extensive 
show of recent pastels, paintings and mixed-media constructions by Hans 
Burkhardt. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhardt, 85, has never received the notice some feel he has deserved, partly 
because he moved away from New York to Los Angeles in 1937 -- before the 
Abstract Expressionist movement, with which he is generally associated, reached 
full flower. Once a protege of Arshile Gorky, Burkhardt taught at Cal State 
Northridge and other Los Angeles art schools. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, interest in the artist has intensified. Last year, Burkhardt's work 
was brought to the attention of the influential New York art critic Donald 
Kuspit, who offered to write the catalogue essay for a recent solo show of 
Burkhardt's work at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Lamenting the "decades of neglect" that have befallen this artist -- some of 
whose techniques predate by 20 years the well-known work of Anselm Kiefer -- 
Kuspit points to "his major achievement, the creation of an authentic tragic 
modernist style, that is, an abstract style that could articulate a tragic 
sensibility." 
</P>
<P>
Kuspit also calls Burkhardt, who has tackled the issue of war during various 
historic conflagrations, "a master -- indeed the inventor -- of the abstract 
memento mori." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hans Burkhardt, Paintings and Pastels 1988-1989" through May at Jack Rutberg 
Fine Arts, 357 N. La Brea. (213) 938-5222. Open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday 
through Friday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 PACIFIC RIM PAST: Emma-Louise Hayley's shop on Melrose Avenue -- which sells 
late 18th- and early 19th-Century hand-colored engravings -- isn't technically 
a gallery. But its clearly arranged wares hung on well-lighted white walls make 
it more suitable for looking at art than many print venues. 
</P>
<P>
On display now, amid more predictable botanical offerings, is a small 
collection of 18th-Century curiosities documenting Capt. James Cook's voyages 
of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-colored engravings, transcribed from drawings by an artist aboard the Cook 
vessel, realistically portray the Pacific Island natives of the 1770s in 
portraits that miss no detail of hairstyle, facial marking or headgear. Also on 
view are water scenes showing the natives' sometimes surrealistically elaborate 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, this was the way people found out about faraway places," said 
Hayley. "The artist could have made the natives look pretty and much more 
European, but instead they look bizarre. And I'm sure they did look bizarre 
when you came upon them out of the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 Emma-Louise Hayley, 8642 Melrose Ave. (213) 657-9580. Open 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 
p.m. Monday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.

RESTAURANT REVIEW;

<P>
UPSTAIRS AT JASMINE TREE, SOLID, CAREFULLY DONE CHINESE COOKING SIZZLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where do Chinese restaurants get their names? The I Ching? A lottery? Is there 
some sort of Chinese restaurant-naming authority that you appeal to, and then a 
couple of weeks later a card comes in the mail printed with the mysterious 
words Jade Garden? 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant in question today is named Jasmine Tree, after a well-known 
flowering plant that comes as a bush or vine, but not as a tree. Possibly the 
tree refers to the fact that the restaurant is well above bush level. It 
belongs to that tiniest category of Los Angeles restaurants, those above the 
ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly the home of Captain Pepper's Shrimp Boat, it is on the second story of 
a mini-mall, upstairs from a health club. This probably accounts for a banner 
recommending that you eat Chinese food for your health, and possibly explains 
an occasional rumbling and shaking from downstairs. In any case, Jasmine Tree 
is a cut above the ordinary Chinese restaurant in having a view -- at least a 
view of Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The room itself is rather pleasant, slightly bowed in the direction of the 
street, and of a peaceful color scheme with a low red and yellow quotient. It's 
quiet rather then rushed, and the jacketed waiters are unusually attentive and 
helpful. These are waiters who actually make suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is upscale Mandarin, meaning, for starters, that in addition to hot 
appetizers there are cold cuts, including vegetarian imitation ham and sliced 
(real) beef shank made aromatic with star anise. Likewise, the list of soups is 
not limited to hot and sour and egg-drop. For instance, there's an unusual duck 
and mushroom soup, with strong duck broth containing substantial quantities of 
duck meat, a good deal of bamboo and both black and paddy mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Among the hot appetizers, the best appears to be minced chicken. The chicken 
meat is mixed with mushrooms, little chunks of ham and pine nuts (these are 
evidently what the menu calls "olive seeds") and served in a lettuce leaf cup. 
There are also spring rolls, fried dumplings (not fried very brown, but the 
mustard they come with seems a little hotter than usual), and a good chicken 
salad with a sharp dressing including pickled red ginger and toasted almonds. 
</P>
<P>
The owner comes from Shanghai, and the Taiwanese chef first worked in Los 
Angeles at the Shanghai Palace. The menu does have a few Shanghai tendencies, 
such as the use of a rich, slightly sweet brown sauce. You find it, for 
instance, on the abalone with tender greens (the greens are lettuce). It's 
always welcome to see abalone on a Chinese menu, especially when it's 
reasonably priced, and this is a very good version, tender and full of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
On the hot, braised whole fish, the brown sauce is enriched with ground pork 
and green onions. Enriched is the word; this is a very filling dish. 
Traditionally you're supposed to finish a Chinese meal with a fish, and this 
one definitely has end of the meal written on it. 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine Tree excels at the sort of dish where little chunks of meat have a 
pungent sauce fried onto them. The citrus chicken is a little bit peppery, and 
there is a trace of blackened orange peel lost among the chicken nuggets, but 
the informing flavor is of the coating of sweet-sour sauce; sweet and pungent 
chicken is much the same, but sweeter. They're very clean and well-balanced. 
</P>
<P>
Moo shu here includes the tiger lily buds (called golden needles) but not the 
scrambled eggs nor, so far as I can tell, the mushrooms. Lily buds aside, the 
spring pancakes, available as an appetizer, are very similar to the moo shu 
except that you can choose other fillings besides pork. 
</P>
<P>
This is solid, carefully done Chinese cooking, with no reek of scorched frying 
oil. It has a few limitations, one being a certain squeamishness about hot 
peppers. The kung pao dishes are very meaty, big chunks of chicken or beef with 
lots of peanuts, but not really very hot. The only really flawed dish seems to 
be the scallops in lemon sauce; it's really in a sweet orange sauce, mawkish 
and out of place with these delicately fried scallops. 
</P>
<P>
There are no desserts at Jasmine Tree, just fortune cookies with happy faces on 
them. This is authentically Chinese, and fitting for a place upstairs from a 
health club. And what did you expect in a tree? 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: mushroom and duck soup, $4.75; minced chicken on lettuce, 
$8.95; citrus chicken, $8.50; sliced abalone with tender greens, $17.50. 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine Tree, 11057 Santa Monica Blvd., L.A. (213) 444-7171. Open for lunch and 
dinner daily, weekdays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays, 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 
p.m., Saturdays, noon to 10:30 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 10 p.m. Beer and wine. 
Parking lot; also valet parking at dinner. American Express, MasterCard and 
Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $23 to $55.

PRESIDENT OF LEADING BLACK THINK TANK STRIVES TO REMAIN NONPARTISAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie N. Williams is constantly on the phone these days, what with black 
politicians so much in the news. 
</P>
<P>
Is Jesse Jackson maintaining his hold on black voters? 
</P>
<P>
How did L. Douglas Wilder, Virginia's first black governor, manage to get 
himself elected? 
</P>
<P>
How is the indictment of Mayor Marion Barry playing with the voters in the 
mostly black District of Columbia? 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of questions regularly put to Williams, who is president of 
the Joint Center for Political Studies, a research institute he has built into 
the nation's premier black think tank. 
</P>
<P>
The center's staff of 60 studies and develops data on the social, political and 
economic activities and concerns of African-Americans. It is best known for its 
annual "Roster of Black Elected Officials," in which the number of blacks in 
public office has risen from 600 in 1970 to more than 7,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The center occupies a special niche at a time when black candidates and voters 
are gaining influence in politics at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
The mainstream is the "new frontier" for blacks seeking public office, Williams 
says, citing the elections in 1989 of both Wilder and David N. Dinkins, the new 
mayor of New York. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the jobs are," he said. "All of the positions that are in 
predominantly black jurisdictions have just about been filled." 
</P>
<P>
Largely disenfranchised in many Southern states until the mid-1960s, black 
voters can claim credit for recent elections of Democratic senators in Alabama, 
Georgia, Louisiana and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia are black. 
</P>
<P>
The black electorate remains overwhelmingly Democratic, but two photographs on 
a wall of Williams' office show how jealously he guards the center's political 
neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
One is a picture of Williams with President Bush; the other shows Williams with 
two-time Democratic presidential contender Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't knock the Joint Center as being liberal or conservative or 
Republican or Democratic, and that's a very difficult position for a black 
organization to maintain," said Robert Bates, a Mobil Oil Co. lobbyist and 
close friend of Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good role to be in, to call the shots as you see them," Williams said. 
"I'll comment on the Republicans and I'll comment on the Democrats. I let the 
chips fall where they may." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), the oldest and most senior black in 
the House and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, said that he often 
makes use of statistical data and analyses from the center on a variety of 
issues, "to focus on a minority viewpoint or get the specifics." 
</P>
<P>
One question Williams is asked frequently is whether Bush and other Republican 
Party leaders will be able to win black voters over to GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity is there, Williams said, "but until the Republicans can succeed 
in recruiting some visible black leaders with a following, and until they 
disabuse themselves of the notion that they can create a black leader, they're 
going to only be modestly successful." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 57, was born in Memphis, Tenn., the only child of Ed Williams, a 
one-armed jazz piano player, and his wife, Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
From his mother, who worked as a maid, Williams learned the value of learning 
and assembling information. She would often bring home books, clothes and other 
articles from the households in which she worked. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what that white boy's reading. Now, you ought to be reading it," she 
would tell him. Thus Williams was able to read books not available to black 
children in the segregated school system. 
</P>
<P>
And he credits Bebe Bowers Fingall, a high school English teacher whose 
students called her "Mama," with helping him develop a competitive spirit and 
self-confidence. As one of "Mama's pets," he said, he was drawn into reading 
all kinds of writings and speaking anthologies and plays. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of 
Illinois and did graduate work in political science at Atlanta and Howard 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
He was director of the Center for Policy Studies at the University of Chicago, 
a director of the U.S. Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and a State 
Department foreign service reserve officer. 
</P>
<P>
Then, 18 years ago, the president of the University of Chicago was startled to 
hear that the school's vice president for public affairs was leaving to head an 
obscure research organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge to me is to make you hear about it," Williams told him. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial link between black elected officials and the institute dates to 
its beginnings in 1970, when psychologist Kenneth Clark and several leading 
black politicians of the time started it with a $2-million grant from the Ford 
Foundation. Today, the center is supported by $3 million a year from private 
foundations and corporations, and Williams is working to raise $5 million to 
match a Ford Foundation pledge of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's mission has been to supply technical assistance to the emerging 
cadre of black elected officials from the ranks of teachers, preachers, farmers 
and local community activists. 
</P>
<P>
"Our role was to help them better understand the processes of governance, to 
share some information and some expertise about administration, planning, 
budgeting, identification of resource acquisition -- those kinds of technical 
things," Williams said.

SPARE THE ROD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earth Day has passed with its anticipated fanfare; citizens have been duly 
galvanized to ecological action and politicians are falling over themselves to 
be environmentally correct. What does this mean to the rod-and-reel fisherman? 
If approached with intelligence and common sense, this increased concern with 
the planet's ecology will mean cleaner water and healthier fish. If pursued 
unwisely, it may significantly disrupt your fishing pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
A major threat lies with the fact that the environmental movement is made up of 
both level-headed people and extremists. 
</P>
<P>
Should extremists decide to attack the sport of fishing, their approach might 
be subtle. For instance, no-fishing areas may be created for vague 
environmental reasons, or no-boating (read no-fishing) zones established to 
"protect swimmers and divers." Even legislation as beneficial as the Gill Net 
Initiative creates openings for anti-sportfishing interests. Section 14 of the 
initiative mandates the establishment of four new "ecological reserves" where 
all fishing will be banned. Although there are hundreds of miles of coastline 
where these reserves could be established, an effort is already under way to 
place them in California's most popular fishing areas. 
</P>
<P>
The harmful nature of these ecological reserves in populated areas is 
significant. They snug up along the coast so their effect is felt most strongly 
by surf fishermen, near-shore anglers (small boaters, kayakers, etc.), and 
those with limited financial means. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla already has an ecological reserve, and it has proven to be overly 
restrictive and costly; local fishermen are unable to fish in their own 
neighborhood, and a person wanting to enjoy a once-popular La Jolla grunion 
hunt has to go elsewhere. Now the environmental activists are calling for even 
more reserves, some of which are to include portions of the San Diego kelp 
beds. The closing of popular fishing sites will obviously cause those that 
remain open to become more crowded. With our expanding population, we need more 
recreational fishing areas, not fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the hundreds of commercial fishing boats and thousands of harbor 
seals and sea lions patrolling the coast, the individual rod-and-reel fisherman 
is not a significant ecological problem; however, he is about to be targeted as 
such.

NOT FOR JOB CORPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What is it exactly that makes (Mt. Laguna) unsuitable" for a Job Corps 
Training Center? posed Sheila A. Sada in her letter to the editor April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, the most important, bottom-line answer: extraordinary cost to 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The site chosen is located on the top of a mountain in the Cleveland National 
Forest, at 6,000 feet, where temperatures frequently fall below freezing and 
winds often reach 100 m.p.h. One can expect building and operating costs for 
year-round heating, transportation and power to be excessive. The U.S. Forest 
Service proposes to renovate the gutted Air Force buildings, removing asbestos, 
PCBs and lead paint: another great cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The Job Corps complex (estimated population 400) will need to build its own 
sewage treatment facility, find a reliable water source, generate its own power 
and establish self-sufficient support services, such as medical care, fire 
protection, law enforcement, child care and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Community services in the tiny village of Mt. Laguna (population 75) are 
essentially non-existent. All food, trash, clothing, waste chemicals/toxics 
will need to be trucked in/out from 40-50 miles away, using a winding mountain 
road that is often closed in the winter. Additional taxpayer funds will be 
required for road maintenance and patrol due to the increased year-round, 
non-recreational traffic. 
</P>
<P>
With so many military bases closing around the country, there is no shortage of 
cost-effective facilities located in established communities that could benefit 
economically from a large Job Corps complex.

WAR OF FALSEHOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time for San Diegans to speak up and make known to the so-called Rev. 
Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition and his ilk that we are not patsies 
for his political agenda. He comes to our community from elsewhere with his 
hateful, bigoted, intolerant views and wants to use the citizens of San Diego 
to promote them. 
</P>
<P>
His opposition to the Human Dignity Ordinance, which provides equal rights, not 
special privileges, to a segment of our population that is continually harassed 
and discriminated against by the likes of Sheldon, is indefensible. These 
people work, pay taxes, contribute to our community and deserve the same equal 
rights as the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, San Diego, lets show these extremists that they're not fooling us with 
their misrepresentations and smoke-screen antics. Support the HDO and equal 
rights for all citizens.

SHERIFF'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A community group in Fallbrook held a meeting with all the candidates for 
sheriff a week ago, which was most enlightening. I would hope that more groups 
do the same, because there doesn't appear to be much in the press about this 
very important race. 
</P>
<P>
One observation made was a statement by one of the candidates, a Mr. (Jack) 
Drown. He said he has worked for no one else but the Sheriff's Department in 
his entire adult life -- over 20 years providing us, the citizens of this 
county, with the best law enforcement possible, claiming that no other 
candidate matches his experience and skills. 
</P>
<P>
Well, all I have to say is that, if the current state of the Sheriff's 
Department is due to Mr. Drown's best efforts and vast experience and 
leadership, I suggest he do us all a favor and step aside and allow change to 
take place. It's apparent that he and Sheriff John Duffy haven't got it right 
in 20 years. We can't afford another 20.

QUALITY OF LIFE IS EVERYONE'S BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine life in Orange County if business cheerfully ignored concerns about 
growth management, traffic congestion and the high cost of housing. Imagine if 
government simply facilitated new economic opportunity and otherwise left 
everything alone. Well, so much for such stereotypes of the frontier in the 
real world of 1990. The latest UC Irvine Executive Survey shows business 
leaders in Orange County increasingly concerned about damage caused to the 
business environment by a host of problems that municipalities and ordinary 
citizens are trying to wrestle with. 
</P>
<P>
In the four years since this regular survey of the county's chief executives 
started, there has been a 21-percentage-point increase in pessimism about the 
county's business climate. Only 23% of those surveyed, most from 
growth-dependent service industries, said the county was a more attractive 
place to do business than the past year. That was a substantial decline from 
the 36% who found the county more attractive in 1987. The important thing was 
the concern expressed by business leaders about problems of traffic congestion 
and housing for employees in the general business environment. 
</P>
<P>
There were signs of optimism about new business formations in retail and 
service areas, and UCI forecasters found signs of continued job growth, both 
here and in overseas markets. But the nagging problems explain why business 
leaders in some parts of the country have been in the vanguard of efforts to 
promote regional solutions to common problems. 
</P>
<P>
There comes a time when the problems that trouble individuals become part of 
the cost and headache of doing business. The personal experience of a worker 
stalled in traffic or unable to find affordable housing for a family ultimately 
affects the business climate. It's one good reason for business and government 
to work together. 
</P>
<P>
The good news from the UC Irvine study is that is that there is much optimism 
in the general business outlook in Orange County. But the study shows that 
business leaders have concerns that are shared by political leaders and 
ordinary citizens.

FIND MONEY FOR SHORTSTOP JAIL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past 11 years, thousands of "pre-delinquent" youths who have had a minor 
brush with the law in Orange County have been sent by judges and others to 
Shortstop, a privately funded program. Youngsters briefly get locked up in a 
holding cell and are told what they can expect if they lead a life of crime. At 
one point, several young people -- some in shackles -- are brought from 
Juvenile Hall or the California Youth Authority to tell their contemporaries 
what it's like behind bars. The two-part program gets parents involved by 
teaching them the signs of drug use, gang membership or other law-breaking. 
They also participate in homework aimed at getting families to communicate. 
Shortstop, like the baseball position after which it is named, is designed to 
intercept a potentially damaging hit. 
</P>
<P>
The program has earned high praise from all involved, including law 
enforcement, district attorneys, public defenders, judges, parents and the 
youths themselves. It is run by the Orange County Bar Foundation, which is 
funded primarily by the Orange County Bar Assn. Last year, Shortstop received a 
$22,000 grant from the CYA to develop a program for Latino youths and their 
families who do not speak English. But it found that more was needed than 
simply translating materials into Spanish. It has asked the county Board of 
Supervisors for $40,000 in seed money to hire staff members to put the program 
on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
The County Justice System Advisory Groups, which make recommendations to the 
board on how to spend $218,000 in state grant money, praised Shortstop 
Programa, as it is called, but couldn't find money to pay for it. The Board of 
Supervisors should override this recommendation and grant the money. 
</P>
<P>
If you follow the money, you can see why it's worthwhile for government to pay 
for attempts to direct pre-delinquent youths away from crime. It costs about 
$150 to put a family through Shortshop; $35 is paid by the family and the rest 
by the Bar Foundation. It costs more than $30,000 to keep a youth locked up for 
a year -- all of it paid by taxpayers. And that is not to mention the hardship 
on young people or their families. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop has proven itself effective and should be encouraged to expand into 
the county's growing and gang-plagued Latino community. The Bar foundation is 
asking for a one-year grant; after that it will find its own funding. If there 
is any way for the Board of Supervisors to find the money without seriously 
harming other important programs, it should. That check to Shortstop Programa 
should have thank you written on it.

VACCINATION PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am responding to a recent letter from a woman who felt that more children 
would receive their vaccinations if the prices charged by private physicians 
were more in line with what they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
When I started pediatric practice in Orange County about 17 years ago, vaccines 
were supplied free by the county health department to physicians who agreed not 
to charge for them. 
</P>
<P>
Many things economic have changed over time. 
</P>
<P>
Today there is only one source for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. The price per 
dose that I must pay is $24.11. Please note that this price includes $4.44 
federal excise tax to fund the federal vaccine injury program. The $24.11 cost 
does not include the cost of a syringe or other office overhead.

CUTTING BACK ON THE USE OF WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent announcement that Orange County has a water shortage and that we all 
must take drastic measures to significantly cut our water usage rings very 
hollow. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Tom Riley and other supervisors were warned by every 
environmental and slow-growth organization that the hyper-development that they 
were approving in South Orange County was without consideration to whether 
there would be resources to support his massive building of his density homes. 
</P>
<P>
We all were ignored, and every development in South County and in the southeast 
part of the county was rubber-stamped approved. Riley led the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we are told all must sacrifice to accommodate this and future development 
by severe water conservation and probably paying a lot more for our water. 
</P>
<P>
If Riley is really serious about the drought, he would offer a law to provide 
for an immediate building moratorium as they have in Santa Barbara County, 
until this problem passes. 
</P>
<P>
Until that happens, I suggest we all continue to wash our cars regularly and 
make sure our lawns are regularly soaked.

CLEARING THE AIR ON THE BALBOA PENINSULA'S KING GILLETTE MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach has a mythology all its own. The town's capacity for myth-making 
is nearly as predictable as the tides that bathe it. And nearly as changeable. 
</P>
<P>
A fine example was encapsuled in a Times article (April 10) about an 
architectural monument at the tip of the Balboa peninsula known as the "King 
Gillette Mansion." 
</P>
<P>
Properly speaking, it was King G. (not C.) Gillette, the son, not the inventor 
of the safety razor, who bought the site and built the home in 1925 (not '26), 
after Newport contractor Paul B. Ellsworth took out a building permit for a 
nine-room (not 23), shingled structure to cost $12,000 (not $24,000). 
</P>
<P>
Among Balboa's best-nurtured tales is that Gillette never spent a night in the 
place. In a feature story last year, Beatrix Padway, whose father-in-law once 
owned the place, opined, "Gillette never moved in because his wife fell in love 
with the architect and they ran off." This year's Times version has it that 
just as Gillette and a convoy of moving vans approached, a wave of biblical 
proportions swept over the roof, whereupon Gillette turned tail, ne'er to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
If so, he missed the better part of eight years' construction, which included 
two more stories, a whole second half and 14 additional rooms. Following these 
post-wave improvements, Gillette sold the property in 1933 to R.V. Jones (not 
the Padway brothers), of Hollywood, for $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes the cherished "feuding (Padway) brothers and house divided" story. 
It likewise falls. 
</P>
<P>
In November of 1936 (not '31), Jones (not Gillette) sold the residence to 
Barney Padway, president of a Beverly Hills mortgage company. It was Barney 
(not Martin and James) Padway who immediately remodeled the three-story spread 
into two Mediterranean houses. Far from any "brotherly feud," Padway occupied 
one half, while the other half was designed for his brother, Judge Joseph A 
Padway, of Milwaukee, Wis. When completed, each half contained 15 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately the Padways would occupy the landmark until World War II, when it 
was taken over by the military. Alas, it was the Army (not the Coast Guard) who 
commandeered the mansion for a base from which two 104-foot crash boats were 
dispatched to retrieve downed fliers at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after the war, Barney Padway sold the "divided house" to Andrew and 
Lucille Bailey for $40,000. After sprucing it up, the Baileys sold in 1972 to 
Dr. Jim Diffley for $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a continuing rise in real estate values, the showplace sold again in 
1976, this time for $275,000. As is well known, the purchaser was aging 
guitar-twanger Richard Anthony Monsour (also known as Dick Dale), "King of the 
surfing fender-benders." At this point, the beach house was described as 17 
rooms with six baths. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Dale was evicted after defaulting on his mortgage (though sex makes 
better reading). Then in considerable disrepair, the place passed to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from which Al and Loyce Grasso bought it. 
</P>
<P>
However, The Times was perfectly correct in stating that the Grassos are now in 
the process of restoring the $1.4-million fixer-upper to its mid-1930s 
Mediterranean grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
I trust that these facts will not confuse the harbor cruise directors, whose 
"ferry" tales have been such a fecund source of local history -- especially 
those regarding the "King Gillette House."

TEAM'S TROUBLES: JUST BOYISH FUN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It often takes someone who has thought long and deeply about social problems to 
set things in perspective. Certainly the chairman of the Academic Senate at Cal 
State Fullerton, who happens to be a sociologist, is right: We are making 
entirely too much of the latest outbreak of boyish high spirits among members 
of the Fullerton football team. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfair to imagine that something might be wrong with Fullerton's program 
simply because its members have repeatedly been involved in violent incidents, 
including one that resulted in someone being beaten to death, just as it is 
wrong to wonder about football programs across the country simply because 
football players seem to be arrested more often than other students for 
assaults on women, thefts of various kinds, selling drugs and other pranks. 
</P>
<P>
In doing these things they are not acting as football players, we are reminded, 
but as private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
If they were not so prominent -- if they were merely art students, for example 
-- they wouldn't be getting all this attention. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure the chairman, as a sociologist, has some knowledge of the behavior of 
art students not available to laymen, but I wonder whether they might turn up 
police blotters less often than football players because they spend their spare 
time in museums rather than bars.

IRVINE MAYOR CANDIDATE'S STATEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, during the annual Career Unit held at the junior high where I teach, 
the eighth-grade students received instruction on how to complete a job 
application. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being taught the importance of filling out an application neatly and 
accurately, students were also told that the falsification of information on a 
job application or resume is grounds for immediate dismissal by most employers. 
</P>
<P>
Most applications contain a statement that job candidates must sign attesting 
to the validity of their information. The beginnings of a trust relationship 
between the employee and employer is established by the job candidate's honest 
presentation of his/her background. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan is asking the voters of Irvine to trust her 
and elect her mayor. That trust has been eroded. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan falsified one of her educational achievements on her campaign 
brochure. Grounds for dismissal? Absolutely! The "employers" of Irvine need to 
"fire" Sally Anne Sheridan. Our young people are watching and learning.

VIETNAMESE NEED TO SHAKE OFF FEAR, STRIKE BACK AT OPPRESSORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN O'LEARY BENNETT, Brian O'Leary Bennett was formerly chief of staff to 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). He now lives and works in Orange 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By any objective standard, when one thinks of America's newest refugee 
community, superlatives mostly come to mind. "Hard-working, industrious, 
well-educated, grateful and successful" have all been rightly earned adjectives 
for describing the Vietnamese-American community. 
</P>
<P>
Calling them political prisoners would seem a tragic epithet from a yesteryear. 
Yet many Vietnamese-Americans are today quietly suffering, and wrongly 
acquiescing, to an oppressor not nearly as obvious as their Communist dictators 
were but no less effective in denying them basic political freedoms of 
expression and press. 
</P>
<P>
Within Orange County's Little Saigon community, a new "internal security force" 
today operates with near-impunity. It is fiendish, secretive, pervasive and 
deadly. It extorts from its victims neither money nor "protection," but silence 
and submission. It cloaks itself in the righteous call for an end to the 
communist domination of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it employs the very same totalitarian tools of fear, intimidation, violence 
and death against any in this Orange County community who might deviate from 
its twisted interpretation of how this goal ought to be achieved. And by its 
every act it mocks the constitutional protections generously extended by its 
adopted home. It is nothing but a band of thugs and shakedown artists unworthy 
of any association with freedom-fighting movements around the world. 
</P>
<P>
While their specific identities are somewhat uncertain, that they indeed exist 
has long been known by many within the publicly silent leadership of the 
Vietnamese community. (They have adopted ridiculous, fascist-sounding names 
like the Vietnamese Party to Exterminate the Communists and Restore the 
Nation.) The FBI and local law enforcement take them very seriously. Their 
record of assassinations, arson fires, vandalism, death threats, beatings and 
bombings warrants no less. 
</P>
<P>
Now their target is Yen Ngoc Do, editor of Nguoi Viet Daily, one of Little 
Saigon's largest and most influential newspapers. They have charged him with 
pro-Hanoi sympathies and sentenced him to death by Monday -- the 15th 
anniversary of the fall of Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
I have been acquainted with Do, his newspaper and his television show for many 
years, and the charges are absurd. He is a constant critic of Hanoi and a 
stalwart anti-communist. That, however, is beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese-American community not only has an obligation to fight for the 
restoration of freedom lost in Vietnam but also to defend the freedom returned 
to them in America. 
</P>
<P>
In this effort, they have not been completely forthright. 
</P>
<P>
For too long many have knowingly ignored widespread corruption, extortion, acts 
of political terrorism and wholesale violations of the travel and export ban 
with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
For understandable but wholly unacceptable reasons, many in the Vietnamese 
community have not always been cooperative with U.S. law enforcement and other 
government agencies. "Government," per se, has not always proved itself worthy 
of that support. Like most Third World victims, the Vietnamese view 
"government" with fear, disdain or, at best, indifference. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, the Vietnamese blame "government" for the loss of their 
republic. This attitude prevents them from cooperating in such simple things as 
a census count to the more serious investigations into political terrorism. 
Regrettably, they forget this is the United States and not Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Where are their leaders and statesmen speaking out against those who threaten 
the lives of their free-thinking intellectuals, authors, community leaders and 
newspaper editors? 
</P>
<P>
Where are the rallies, the protests? 
</P>
<P>
Where are the brave men and women who would step up, point fingers and kick out 
those who are mugging their First Amendment rights? 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, where are those great American-born civil rights advocates and 
organizations who should be standing at the side of this Vietnamese-American 
community demanding justice for our newest citizens? 
</P>
<P>
In all important respects, Do is no different from Salman Rushdie, threatened 
with death by extremists unless he toes their line. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the United States declared war on Germany and Japan, President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt said to the American people: "We look forward to a world 
founded upon four essential freedoms. The first is freedom of speech and 
expression. . . . The second is freedom to worship. . . . The third is freedom 
from want. . . . The fourth is freedom from fear." 
</P>
<P>
Enough is enough, Little Saigon. You have excelled economically. It is time to 
mature politically. 
</P>
<P>
For Yen Ngoc Do, for those victimized and killed before him, and for all those 
now frozen by fear from exercising free expression, it is time to declare war, 
retake your community and enjoy all the freedoms of America.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 11-month-old baby died Friday after falling, apparently headfirst, into a 
bucket of water at his home in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Flown by helicopter to Children's Hospital, Jesus Sandoval was placed on 
life-support systems, but he died just before midnight Friday, according to the 
San Diego county coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandoval infant, who was apparently left unattended for a moment in the 
family living room, crawled 20 feet to the water bucket and fell in head-first, 
according to a spokesman for the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy confirmed that drowning was the cause of death, the coroner's 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokeswoman Sharon Ross said the baby is the son of Hector and 
Clotilde Sandoval of the 200 block of West Los Angeles Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Several San Diego-area children have been taken to the hospital after nearly 
drowning since Easter, Ross said. She said three 2-year-old babies remain 
hospitalized and two others have been treated and released. A 16-year-old girl, 
drowned in the ocean, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There just seems to be a rash of drowning incidents right now," Ross said. 
"People are going outside more, I guess, and they should be more careful so 
this kind of thing won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Roy Stamper said that Deputy Ed Gomez and a Vista Fire 
Department crew dispatched to the house about 2:30 p.m. were able to revive the 
child temporarily.

TUSTIN'S HELICOPTERS OVER IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your pro and con letters (April 22) on the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air 
Station all missed the primary objection to this Marine country club. 
</P>
<P>
None pointed out that very few of the Marines assigned to that station actually 
work there. 
</P>
<P>
It is, unfortunately, true that helicopter crews must pass over the heads of 
the Irvine, Tustin, Orange and Anaheim residents on their way to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
You see, there is no area in Orange County where they can perform practice 
combat flying, and they are a combat station, the same as El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
So, in order to get to one of the three major combat training areas where they 
work, a skeleton crew flies a two or three jet helicopter burning more fuel 
than a Boeing 727 or 737. Next time you fly to San Francisco or Sacramento, 
remember that your jet is burning the same amount of jet fuel going to your 
destination as the three Marines in the jet helicopter flying to work at Yuma, 
Imperial Valley or Twentynine Palms burn in theirs.

BORDER PROTESTERS SEEK END TO VIOLENCE AGAINST MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TIJUANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated by a perceived trend toward the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico 
border, protesters gathered Saturday at a major undocumented crossing zone in 
Tijuana and called for an end to violence against immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which numbered more than one hundred and included many migrants 
waiting along the border, initiated its protest in reaction to the 
well-publicized "Light Up the Border Campaign" in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The "Light Up the Border" group, which held its sixth protest Friday evening in 
San Diego, seeks greater enforcement along the border and has drawn 
considerable support. 
</P>
<P>
"We want everyone to know that more lights and border patrol officers will do 
nothing to solve the problems of the border area, but will only make things 
worse, " said Maria Erana, who helped organize Saturday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the protesting groups underscores the increasing division in 
Mexico and the United States about the thorny issue of illegal immigration, 
which U.S. officials say is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's protest took place along the southern levee of the Tijuana River, in 
an area known as El Bordo, or the edge. The area has long been a major illegal 
crossing zone, and on Saturday evening, scores of migrants were amassed atop 
the concrete levee. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters placed flowers in front of hand-crafted crosses named in honor 
of dozens of deceased immigrants -- some shot by U.S. authorities, others 
killed by border thieves, and others who perished in accidents en route to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
While condemning alleged abuses by U.S. authorities, the protesters also 
criticized what they say is extensive extortion of would-be immigrants by 
Mexican authorities, who have long solicited bribes from those attempting to 
cross the border. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's protest was the second by the Tijuana-based community group, which 
has criticized the "Light Up the Border Campaign" as racist and anti-immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the "Light Up the Border" group have denied allegations of 
racism, contending that their aim is merely to stop illegal immigration and 
drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
But to the Tijuana protesters, the solutions offered by the "Light Up the 
Border" activists are simplistic and shortsighted and will only result in more 
violence against migrants. Some protesters Saturday called for an open border, 
which would allow free flow between Mexico and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"All workers have a right to seek jobs across the border," said Carmen Valadez, 
one of the leaders of Saturday's protest.

TWO FOUND DEAD IN SURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities said Saturday that they discovered the bodies of a man and a woman 
-- both believed to be undocumented immigrants -- who apparently went into the 
Pacific Ocean near Imperial Beach while attempting to evade U.S. immigration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The two, neither of whom was identified, apparently drowned, said Sgt. Roy 
Stamper of the San Diego County Sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
One report, provided by the San Diego County coroner's office, said the two 
were washed out to sea while attempting to cross the Tijuana River, near the 
point where the river empties into the Pacific Ocean. Other migrants reported 
the incident to U.S. immigration authorities, the coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheriff's Sgt. Stamper said the two were being chased by U.S. Border Patrol 
agents and ran into the surf to avoid capture. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol officials could not be reached for comment late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The swampy Tijuana River area is traversed nightly by hundreds of undocumented 
immigrants en route to the United States. U.S. Border Patrol agents patrol the 
area extensively. 
</P>
<P>
The incident happened either late Friday night or early Saturday morning, 
officials said. Both bodies were found floating close to the shore off Imperial 
Beach, near Seacoast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Surfers found the woman's body about 1 p.m., said a spokesman for the San Diego 
County coroner's office. The man's body was found shortly after 6 p.m. in 
approximately the same area, Stamper said.

AL DAVIS IS MASTER OF THE ROAD SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY MATHEWS, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the best of all schemes to find a home for the Raiders of the National 
Football League came recently from a Los Angeles architect, Herb McLaughlin, 
who suggested that team owner Al Davis build a floating stadium and take it up 
and down the Pacific Coast, collecting tribute from dozens of cities instead of 
the mere three or four he has been negotiating with lately. 
</P>
<P>
With outraged citizens having just spiked a $486 million deal to return the 
team to its original home in Oakland and with officials in Sacramento, Los 
Angeles (the team's current host) and other cities grumbling about the Raiders' 
hard-eyed negotiating tactics, one might think the Raiders owner would be 
feeling a little low. But McLaughlin, who helpfully provided a sketch of his 
idea to the Los Angeles Times op-ed page, appreciates Davis's indefatigable 
capacity for thinking big. 
</P>
<P>
"The National Football League talks of expanding the game to Europe and Japan," 
the architect noted. "The stadium could motor on over to Osaka for a game or 
two in August, then load up with Toyotas to be dropped off in Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
The image of a floating stadium -- easy to turn so Raiders receivers would 
never have the sun in their eyes -- captures the spirit of Edward Everett 
Hale's story of Philip Nolan in "The Man Without a Country." In the novel, 
Nolan is sentenced for treason and condemned to roam the seas with no contact 
with the America he discovers -- too late -- he loves. Davis's search for a 
city and stadium full of adoring fans is a much less romantic tale, revealing 
more about modern sports financing and civic promotion than old-fashioned 
concepts such as loyalty and community, but at this bizarre juncture there are 
some loose similarities. 
</P>
<P>
Like the naval officers who came to pity and admire the traitor Nolan for his 
late-blooming patriotism, the city of Oakland swallowed the pain of Davis's 
1982 betrayal, when he moved the team to Los Angeles, and spent months crafting 
a deal to bring him back. Davis has never asked for love and affection, only 
for as much money and support as possible to provide a stadium that would 
attract free-spending fans whose dollars would buy the linebackers, offensive 
tackles and particularly the elusive superstar quarterback needed to win 
another Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson thought he had arranged for the team to 
return in exchange for a city and county guarantee of $660 million in ticket 
sales over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the midst of a difficult re-election campaign, Wilson began to hear 
not just from fans, many of whom did not live in Oakland, but from voters. At 
the hearing where the deal initially was approved by the city council, some 
Oakland residents referred to Davis as "the embodiment of greed." Editorial 
cartoons questioned the risk to taxpayer dollars at a time of huge expenses 
following last year's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
A citizen's group collected 33,189 petition signatures for a referendum on the 
deal, effectively dooming the agreement since the Raiders said they would back 
out if the issue went on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson reversed himself and said he no longer supported the deal, even with the 
reduced $486 million guarantee he had hoped would assuage the critics. But his 
press secretary, Carol McArthur, said the mayor remains full of hope of a 
Raiders return. He has begun to negotiate a new deal, she said, "and the 
Raiders are very receptive to that and very interested in coming to Oakland 
still." 
</P>
<P>
In all such matters, one has to take the city's word for it. Davis and the 
Raiders have declined all comment on their wandering affections. They will not 
say what their intentions are toward the several communities they have dealt 
with in the past three years. "We decided if we addressed all the details of 
that," said Raiders executive assistant Al LoCasale, "we wouldn't get any work 
done." 
</P>
<P>
There have been suggestions Davis has tired once again of Oakland's cranky 
inconsistencies, and is thinking more seriously about Los Angeles' latest 
efforts to keep him here. "I want to ensure Los Angeles continues to have a 
professional football team," said Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley last week after 
a round of talks over renovation of the Coliseum. "Six weeks ago, many thought 
the odds were in favor of the Raiders moving to Oakland. I said it's not over 
until it's over," a lesson most who have dealt with Davis now have engraved on 
their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more pitiful stories is of the city of Irwindale, a small community 
northeast of Los Angeles that thought it could turn one of its barren rock 
quarries next to Interstate 210 into a stadium that would bring the Raiders, 
fans, wealth and fortune. It handed Davis a $10 million non-refundable deposit 
as a sign of its good faith in promising to help build the facility, then 
watched in horror as the deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Sacramento, the booming state capital, which had a stadium under 
construction as part of an ambitious effort to attract a major-league baseball 
team. City planners said a football team would bring $1.3 billion in economic 
growth over 20 years, so the city agreed to give the Raiders $50 million, the 
first payment due after the first Sacramento home game, if the team stayed for 
20 years in a privately financed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
There was, city spokeswoman Christine Olsen explained, "what we lovingly called 
a drop-dead clause in the offer." If the Raiders did not accept by March 1, the 
deal was off. Davis was in feverish negotiations with Oakland by then and let 
the deadline pass. Olsen said Sacramento still is interested in having a 
football team, but if the Raiders reopen talks, "that will be a different 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Spokespersons for Los Angeles, Oakland and Sacramento have had no public 
complaints about Davis's behavior in this endless tag-team match of lawyers and 
accountants. The owner's refusal to make public comments has probably eased his 
dealings with publicity-conscious, hypersensitive mayors and council members, 
and with the local business groups leading some of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But relations between cities have suffered. The potential for bitter conflict 
was clear in the recent San Francisco grand-jury indictment of Sacramento 
developer Gregg Luckenbill, a prime mover in the negotiations with the Raiders, 
and others for alleged misdemeanor conspiracy. They are charged with 
circumventing campaign-reporting laws in helping defeat an initiative for a new 
San Francisco baseball stadium that might have hurt Sacramento's efforts to get 
a team. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland and Alameda County officials also spoke acidly of Rich Milner, chief of 
staff for Assemblyman Mike Roos, D-Los Angeles, who was critical of the 
financial deal they were offering Davis. Milner told the San Francisco Examiner 
"if their 15-year scenario doesn't work out, they're going to end up in debt 
after 15 years, having to pay on those bonds for another 15 years with no 
guarantee that the Raiders are going to stay." Alameda County supervisor Mary 
King, noting Roos's Los Angeles constituency, called the remarks "totally and 
completely biased." 
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the rest of the state have been just as quick to declare 
support for a bill that would require a county vote before Los Angeles made 
major alterations in the Coliseum, a significant hurdle to any effort to 
persuade Davis to stay here. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Coliseum's private operators told Bradley that any remodeling 
would maintain the famous peristyle known to viewers of the 1932 and 1984 
Olympics and be "consistent with the historic and architectural significance of 
the structure." 
</P>
<P>
How this affects Davis' efforts to arrange construction of new luxury boxes and 
other improvements in a lease that expires after the 1991 season remains 
unclear. Alisa Spilman, spokeswoman for the Coliseum and Sports Arena, said she 
cannot comment on the negotiations. Bradley said he would be in touch with 
Davis, but has provided no clue to the owner's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
The tumult in Oakland has warned eager suitors that a deal with Davis has its 
political drawbacks. Those who know the Raiders owner say he is a man full of 
warmth and loyalty, doing only what is best for his team, but there are many 
disenchanted spectators and taxpayers along the California coast who cringe at 
the thought of his floating into town and might agree with Sir Walter Scott: 
</P>
<P>
 "High though his titles, proud his name, 
</P>
<P>
 Boundless his wealth and wish can claim, 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these title, power, and pelf, 
</P>
<P>
 The wretch, concentred all in self."

<P>
HARBOR'S RYAN KARP PROVES HE CAN HIT, FIELD, PITCH -- AND COMMUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just call Ryan Karp Mr. Versatility. In two seasons on Harbor College's 
powerful baseball team, he has been successful on the mound, at the plate, in 
the outfield and the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Karp has also made a big geographical adjustment, going from a high school in 
affluent Beverly Hills to a community college in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to tease me a lot about it," Karp said. "The Beverly Hills boy in 
Harbor. It really used to bother me, but not anymore. I just want to play 
college baseball and get an education." 
</P>
<P>
Karp drives 45 minutes daily from his parents' Beverly Hills home to be part of 
Harbor's successful baseball program. It has proven to be a worthwhile effort 
for the 20-year-old, who has earned the praise of Seahawk Coach Jim O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"If we make it all the way to the state finals," O'Brien said, "he can play 
first base in one game, center field in the next game, and he can pitch in the 
last game. He can play all three with no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Last season Karp was an All-American center fielder and a .377 hitter on a 
Harbor team that went 33-17 and placed third at the state tournament in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
This year, starting at first base, he's still a top hitter (.345) on an even 
stronger Seahawk club that clinched its fifth consecutive conference title last 
week. Karp and freshman Erik Russell are tied for second on the team in home 
runs with five each. 
</P>
<P>
As a pitcher, Karp, a left-hander, is 3-0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws hard," O'Brien said. "He's got a good moving fastball and a pretty 
good curve ball. He's also got a great change-up." 
</P>
<P>
Hitting, however, seems to be his forte. Karp ripped a couple of home runs over 
the right-field fence in Harbor's 10-2 win over Mission on April 19. The 
victory gave the Seahawks their 11th conference title since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The first homer, in the bottom of the fourth inning, gave the top-ranked 
Seahawks a 3-0 lead, and the second gave them a 6-0 edge in the bottom of the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Karp followed his back-to-back homers with an RBI double to deep left in the 
bottom of the seventh. A professional baseball scout, who doesn't want to be 
identified because Karp is under control by the Houston Astros, said he's 
impressed by the young athlete's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him pitch in the winter," the scout said as he watched Karp take the 
field, "and I thought he had a great chance as a pitcher. He can also swing the 
bat real well. He has a real good body, and the more he develops, the better 
he'll get." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-4 and 195 pounds, Karp has impressed many with his powerful hitting 
and pitching. After last season he was drafted by the Astros, who own his 
rights until June. 
</P>
<P>
But unless he gets an extraordinary pro offer, Karp wants to play college ball 
and get a degree in accounting. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month he signed a letter of intent with the University of Miami, a 
powerhouse Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
Miami has plans for Karp as a hitter and pitcher, though Turtle Thomas, the 
Hurricanes' baseball recruiting coordinator, said Monday that he wouldn't 
comment on individual recruits until the entire recruiting class signs. 
</P>
<P>
"The information on all our recruits will be released in an article in the 
Miami Herald in a couple of weeks," Thomas said. "I wish I could tell you a lot 
of good things about him, but I can't at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
Karp picked Miami because he likes hot, humid weather and he has relatives 
there. The sophomore was also recruited by major programs such as Texas A &amp; 
M and Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Being pursued by big schools was a change for Karp, who had few options a 
couple of years ago. He had virtually nowhere to go after graduating from 
Beverly Hills High, where he played baseball, basketball and football. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get lots of attention in high school," Karp said. "Beverly Hills is 
not known for its athletes or good athletics. They think the kids from Beverly 
Hills don't want it as bad. Well . . . I want it just as bad." 
</P>
<P>
After high school, Karp went to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in hopes of earning a 
starting spot on the baseball team. He left after one quarter because his 
chances of making the cut looked grim. He transferred to Harbor in the spring 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even going to play (at San Luis Obispo)," Karp said. "I wasn't going 
to make varsity." 
</P>
<P>
The bench was an unfamiliar position for the three-sport letterman from Beverly 
Hills. As a high school senior, he had led the Normans to the semifinals of the 
CIF 5-A baseball playoffs with powerful hitting and consistent pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Karp still holds school records for most home runs (nine) and RBIs (49) in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Karp's success, however, Beverly Hills Coach Bill Erickson said there 
are several reasons why he wasn't highly recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just started growing physically," Erickson said. "He was a skinny, 
awkward kid who hadn't matured into his body until the end of his senior year. 
Another shortcoming is that he wasn't as competitive as we felt he should be. 
He was not as confident in himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I see a totally different person. He's much more confident. He's a hell of 
a lot stronger, and he's much more determined. He also plays a lot harder. 
Going to Harbor is the best thing that could have happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
It's also one of the best things that could have happened to the playoff-bound 
Seahawks, who wrapped up their regular season Thursday with an impressive 41-5 
record (19-0 in the Southern California Athletic Conference). 
</P>
<P>
Despite having a deep and talented pitching staff, O'Brien said Karp has a good 
chance of pitching in the playoffs, which begin May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Karp likes the idea. "I'd really love to," he said, smiling. "I like pitching 
because I have control of the game. I'd have to say pitching is my favorite." 
</P>
<P>
But it really doesn't matter where he plays, as long as he contributes to the 
Seahawks' quest to capture a third state title in O'Brien's 15 years at Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like doing it all," Karp said. "I just love playing baseball."

CSUN CLINCHES SOFTBALL TITLE WITH SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge softball team secured its ninth consecutive California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. title Saturday by sweeping a doubleheader from UC 
Riverside at Lady Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Northridge pounded out 21 hits -- including four doubles -- and 
pitchers Debbie Dickmann and De Dow held Riverside to 10 singles as the Lady 
Matadors claimed their eighth undisputed conference championship in the past 
nine years with 3-1 and 7-0 wins. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors have won 11 of their past 12 games and 10 conference games in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which has four conference games left, holds a four-game lead over 
Cal State Bakersfield, which has concluded conference play. Third-place Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo is five games behind heading into a doubleheader today at 
CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Dickmann surrendered six hits and struck out six to improve 
to 20-7, and Erin McGuire went two for three with two runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Dow (8-5) scattered four singles in the second game to record her fifth shutout 
of the season, and Lisa Erickson went three for three with an RBI and two runs 
for the Lady Matadors (40-18 overall, 15-1 in conference play). 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside threatened briefly in the fourth inning of the opening game, 
trimming an early CSUN lead to 2-1. But Erickson scored on McGuire's single in 
the home half of the inning to provide the final margin.

BASEBALL: SHARTS' PITCHING, CLAYTON'S HOME RUN BEAT RIVERSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It doesn't sport the flashiest statistics, but the Cal State Northridge 
pitching staff has become a winner by merely bending, rarely breaking. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge entered Saturday's California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball 
game against UC Riverside with an earned-run average of 5.09. But for the 
Matadors, who average 6.8 runs a game, five runs are not difficult to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sharts can attest to that after his 7-6 complete-game victory over the 
Highlanders at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore from Simi Valley High gave up 11 hits and walked five, yet raised 
his record to 3-1 and gave the streaking Matadors (31-16, 18-6 in conference 
play) a sweep of the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge holds a 1 1/2-game lead over the Highlanders (33-15, 17-8) in the 
CCAA standings with six conference games left. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors have won six of their past seven games and nine consecutive CCAA 
contests while Riverside has lost four of its past five conference games. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on a good hot streak," said Sharts, who struck out a season-high 11 
batters. "Our bats have been uncontrollable over the last three weeks. We 
cooled down a little today, but we had the right hits at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
No hit loomed larger than Craig Clayton's two-out, two-run home run in the 
sixth, which snapped a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 5-4, after 5 1/2 innings, Northridge tied the score when Mike Solar 
walked with one out and scored when left fielder Scott Hayward dropped Andy 
Hodgins' fly ball to deep left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
Hodgins moved to third on Mike Sims' groundout to set the stage for Clayton's 
10th home run, a drive to left. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was going out," said Clayton, who was three for five and 
drove in four runs. "I thought I got under the ball too much, but (Hayward) 
kept going back and back." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, whose two-run double in the fourth gave Northridge a 4-1 lead, took 
Sharts off the hook with his blast. The 6-foot-6 right-hander had been shelled 
for five hits and four runs in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"After we scored those runs in the fourth, I kind of had a letdown," Sharts 
admitted. "I wasn't bearing down like I should have." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside tied the score, 4-4, on Ruben Ayala's one-out, three-run double off 
the wall in left. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts struck out Logan Ostrander for the second out, but Hayward drove in 
Ayala with a ground-rule double to center. Chad Townsend singled Ostrander to 
third, and John Holmes walked to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Saugstad, who started the inning with a double to right-center, forced 
Holmes at second to end the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, whose RBI groundout in the third inning tied the score, 1-1, was in 
trouble again in the seventh and eighth before retiring the side in order -- 
the last two batters on strikeouts -- in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Ostrander doubled off the wall in left-center to start the seventh. Holmes 
walked two outs later, and both runners moved up a base on a wild pitch. But 
Saugstad flied out to center to quell the rally. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Riverside scored a run on a walk and two singles, but Sharts 
struck out Ostrander and Hayward to end the inning with runners at second and 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very big series for us, but we don't have it wrapped up by any 
means," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "We've put ourselves in a good 
position, but it's not over. We still have to go up to (Cal Poly) San Luis 
Obispo for three games and we play two of three games at Cal State L. A."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / VINCE KOWALICK;

<P>
GOLDEN LEAGUE HITTERS AVAIL THEMSELVES OF 'ONE OF THOSE DAYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If offense is what you like, you'd have been enraptured Friday at any of three 
Golden League baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: Saugus High routed Ridgecrest Burroughs, 17-6; Quartz Hill battered 
Palmdale, 16-10; and Antelope Valley outslugged Canyon, 20-10 -- a composite 79 
runs, 82 hits (29 for extra bases, including 21 doubles and seven home runs) 
and 18 errors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a fastball contest," said Palmdale's Travis Wilson, who belted a 
pair of two-run home runs at Quartz Hill. "There were not too many curves 
thrown in that game." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Quartz Hill junior Ron Turner logged the league's only complete 
game that day, "scattering" 13 hits -- including three home runs, a triple and 
two doubles. 
</P>
<P>
At Ridgecrest, Saugus hit five doubles and two home runs in an 18-hit attack. 
Shortstop Walter White, who yielded to a designated-hitter most of last season, 
tied a school record with five hits in as many at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
White hit the first home run of his career and catcher J. B. Johnson hit his 
fifth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball seemed like it was huge," White said. "Every time we hit the ball it 
was hard and in the right spot. Every time the ball was hit in the outfield it 
was in the gap." 
</P>
<P>
At Antelope Valley, the home club jumped on three pitchers for eight runs in 
the first inning. The Antelopes hit seven doubles -- three by Tony Abrams, who 
was four for five with four runs batted in. Canyon added three doubles and a 
combined seven pitchers made appearances. 
</P>
<P>
The high-desert winds might be used to explain such offensive fireworks. 
Earlier this season, Saugus center fielder Pat Henry was forced to exit a game 
at Quartz Hill after dirt blown from the infield affected his contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
But Palmdale's Wilson and coaches Mike Van Cheri of Antelope Valley and Doug 
Worley of Saugus all attested to calm conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very mild," Van Cheri said. "I guess it was just one of those days." 
</P>
<P>
Add runs, hits and errors: An unidentified player for Einstein Academy 
approached Oak Hill baseball Coach Phil Bruder before Friday's Westside League 
game at Van Nuys Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'When the score reaches 30, do we get to go home?' " Bruder said. 
</P>
<P>
He must have known something, for after three innings, including a 25-run third 
that took about an hour and 45 minutes, the game was called with Oak Hill 
leading, 30-1. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Lance Strokolis hit three home runs, including two grand slams in the 
third inning, and had 11 RBIs. Oak Hill had 17 hits to go with eight errors by 
Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
"The umpire came to me in the third inning and said, 'What do you think?' " 
Bruder said. "I said, 'I'd like to go home.' 
</P>
<P>
"We played everyone by the second inning," he said. "We never bunted and we 
never stole after it was 10-0. I told the kids not to run unless the ball was a 
base hit. The umpire widened the strike zone, but I wasn't going to have my 
kids strike out on purpose. I wasn't going to make a mockery of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Workaholic: Doug Maggiora likes to pitch. A lot. So that's what he does. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Maggiora (6-foot-4, 165 pounds), a lanky junior right-hander for 
Saugus, leads Valley-area pitchers with 66 1/3 innings and 16 appearances. His 
record is 8-1 with 45 strikeouts and a 2.43 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Maggiora, the most-experienced pitcher on a sophomore-stocked staff, adapted a 
squirrelly side-arm delivery this season to increase longevity. Consequently, 
he has routinely made middle-inning entries this season. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, with Saugus leading Ridgecrest Burroughs, 7-6, in the fifth inning, 
Maggiora pitched the final three innnings to earn his fourth save. He also 
earned a save Tuesday against Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it," Maggiora said of the workload. "It's no problem, especially since 
I made the switch. It's not really a strain on my arm since I throw underhand. 
It's almost like softball." 
</P>
<P>
Hardwood hero: Bob Mandeville is sometimes more concerned with double-teams 
than double plays. 
</P>
<P>
Mandeville leads a double life. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Mandeville coach of the Notre Dame baseball team, he is the leading 
scorer for the Flying Tigers, a recreational basketball team for which he has 
averaged 39 points a game over the past five contests. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any plays," Mandeville said. "We just run and gun." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of his points come via the three-point shot, Mandeville, 28, who 
stands 6-feet and weighs 180 pounds, says he can perform a 360-degree dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Mandeville was a second-team All-Southern Section guard at Notre Dame in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He also was a third-team All-Southern Section baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
Never the bride: Agoura's Bryan Dameworth met the challenge of all high school 
cross-country runners across the nation last fall and currently has the fastest 
3,000-meter time in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But there is one individual the Charger senior has shadowed since 1988: Coley 
Candaele of Carpinteria has won 1-A Division 1,600 titles the past two years 
while Dameworth finished second last year and third in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And it looks as if Candaele is laying the groundwork for a hat trick. The 
Warrior senior has the leading time in the nation in the 800 (1:51.19) and 
1,500 (3:52.01). Candaele recorded the latter mark in winning the event at Mt. 
SAC last Saturday while Dameworth finished third in 3:53.53. 
</P>
<P>
Since his sophomore year, Dameworth has run the 1,600 as a precursor to the 
3,200, the event in which he will attempt to win his fourth 1-A title in a row.

PHIPPS WINS AT SAUGUS BEFORE 5,048

Dave Phipps of Simi Valley slipped by Larry Krieger of Reseda on Lap 3 of the 
40-lap Sportsman Main Event and went on the win the feature before a 
season-high crowd of 5,048 Saturday night at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Will Harper of Tarzana, the season points leader, edged by 
Krieger on Lap 37 to finish second. Krieger held on for third and Lance Hooper 
of Palmdale placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier events, John Covan of Simi Valley withstood two yellow flags and a 
red flag to win the Sportsman 15-lap semi main by nearly a straightaway over 
Jerry Bosson of Simi Valley, and Joe Barreras Sr. of Canyon Country led from 
start to finish in the Hobby Stock oval 12-lap semi main. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap heat-race winners included Krieger (Sportsman), Russ Wolff of 
Glendale (Hobby Stock figure-eight), Scott Dinger of Simi Valley (Jalopy) and 
Gerald Gledhill of Reseda (Hobby Stock). 
</P>
<P>
Fastest qualifying times were posted by John Cran of Reseda in the Sportsman 
class (16.87 seconds; 71.13 m.p.h.), Mike Mandel of Arleta in the Hobby Stock 
division (19.54; 61.41 m.p.h.) and Richard Smith of Reseda in the Jalopies 
(20.75, 57.83 m.p.h). 
</P>
<P>
Trophy-dash winners included Cran (Sportsman), Wolff (Hobby Stock), Jeff Holmes 
(Jalopy); and Shannon Flavin of West Hills (Hobby Stock figure-eight). 
</P>
<P>
Holmes and Smith battled well ahead of the field in the 15-lap Jalopy main 
event before Holmes, seventh in the points standings, held off Smith to win. 
However, Smith later was disqualified and Jerry Carfley of Mission Hills was 
moved into the runner-up position. 
</P>
<P>
In the 25-lap Hobby Stock main event Oliver Aguilar, who had failed to finish 
in two previous tries this year, passed Flavin on the backstretch of Lap 14 and 
went on to an easy win. Flavin, fifth in the season points standings, finished 
second and Wolff was third.

Josh Brewer of Oak View and Mike Gray of Ventura each won two races in the

MUTUAL FUNDS: REGIONAL FUNDS PUT EGGS IN FEWER BASKETS 
</P>

<P>
People around the country now can invest in a mutual fund that is placing its 
bets almost exclusively on companies with a big stake in California. 
</P>
<P>
The new Growth Fund of California soon will start buying shares in companies 
that are either headquartered in the nation's most populous state or have 
substantial operations here. 
</P>
<P>
It's the latest wrinkle in regional stock funds, which invest mostly in 
companies of a single state or group of states. 
</P>
<P>
"California as a region is economically equivalent to the sixth-largest country 
in the world, behind France and ahead of Britain," said Dick Ollen, president 
of Monarch Investment Services Co. of Springfield, Mass., which will manage the 
fund. "We think there are outstanding opportunities here." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds good, but how will such a fund perform? This one is untested, so no one 
can predict. But the history of regional stock funds isn't encouraging. As a 
group, they haven't fared especially well. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain of self-imposed limitations, usually spelled out in the 
prospectus, that hamstring portfolio managers by reducing the number of stocks 
they can purchase. "They all impose some geographic restrictions that could 
impair performance," said Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the No-Load Fund 
Investor newsletter in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. "This is another case of funds 
probably started for marketing reasons more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents counter that the funds, when run well, have an inherent advantage in 
that the portfolio manager can really get to know the companies in his or her 
back yard. Certainly, this has been the case with Bing Carlin, who runs the IAI 
Regional Fund out of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
IAI Regional concentrates on Minnesota, Wisconsin and five less-populous states 
in the surrounding area. Carlin says he has about 300 stocks from which to 
choose and knows top managers at many of these corporations as neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Carlin says he served in the Naval Reserves during the 1960s with 
Michael Sullivan, president and chief executive of International Dairy Queen, 
and played Pee-Wee football with Michael W. Wright, chairman of Super Valu 
Stores Inc. "And I grew up having snowball fights on Humboldt Avenue in 
southeast Minneapolis with Lloyd Johnson, now the head of Norwest Corp.," 
Carlin added. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, an astute regional portfolio manager often can be the first to 
recognize promising stocks. "We try to find companies before Wall Street finds 
them," says Carlin, whose fund has outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 
index since its debut in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Byl, senior portfolio manager of the Seattle-based Composite Northwest 
Select 50 Fund, agrees that regional portfolios have a research edge, even in 
an era when information flows faster than ever. "Telecommunication advances 
allow you to follow other U.S. companies, and even international firms, as 
easily as those in your back yard. However, we get insights others won't get 
simply by picking up a phone and calling a company once a quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Byl doesn't consider the geographical limitation to be a problem -- even though 
his fund emphasizes stocks in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Montana and Idaho, 
hardly a region with an excessive number of corporations. In Byl's view, having 
a smaller "universe" of stocks forces a portfolio manager to diversify in other 
ways, particularly by industry and type of company. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, even a well-diversified regional fund can falter if the local 
economy gets into serious trouble. Consider what happened to the Fund of the 
Southwest, part of the Houston-based Capstone Group. For the 15 years ended 
March 31, the portfolio showed a total return of 776%, according to Lipper 
Analytical Services. But over the last five years of that period, it rose just 
58%. Fund of the Southwest concentrates on companies based or doing a large 
chunk of their business in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, New Mexico and 
Arizona. When energy prices slumped in the mid-1980s, the fund did, too. 
</P>
<P>
Another portfolio, USAA Mutual Sunbelt Era, last year changed its name to USAA 
Mutual Aggressive Growth and abandoned its geographic orientation after posting 
below-average returns for the previous six years. With roughly $140 million in 
assets, it had been one of the largest regional stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, three funds that focus on companies in the Washington, D.C., 
area have lagged the market. This list includes the Growth Fund of Washington, 
which is not open to California investors. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa is the headquarters of another struggling regional, the Orange 
County Growth Fund. Newport Securities Corp. launched this portfolio in March, 
1988, in hopes of capitalizing on what has become one of the more economically 
diverse urban areas in the United States. "Orange County's gross county product 
amounts to $55 billion, and it's growing twice as fast as the national 
average," says Jeffrey L. Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities and 
portfolio manager of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Growth Fund invests at least 65% of its assets in companies 
headquartered in the county. Kilpatrick says he can choose from among 300 
corporations in more than 80 industries, ranging from Fluor Corp. (engineering) 
to Community Psychiatric Centers (hospitals) to Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. 
(fast-food). 
</P>
<P>
Despite the geographic concentration of stocks, the fund's holdings aren't 
especially vulnerable to a slowdown in the local economy, Kilpatrick says. 
"Very few of the companies do more than 5% of their business in Orange County. 
It's not like we're buying a mom-and-pop doughnut shop that will only grow if 
Orange County grows." 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Orange County Growth Fund has had trouble getting its message 
across. The portfolio counts just 175 or so shareholders and $1 million in 
assets -- minuscule amounts for a mutual fund. In a bid to attract investors, 
Newport Securities has suspended the fund's 5.75% up-front sales load and has 
abolished its annual 12b-1 fee. 
</P>
<P>
Kilpatrick argues that Orange County Growth's problems are shared by many 
smaller mutual funds, not just those with a geographic focus. But as a group, 
regional funds have had a hard time gaining the attention of investors. 
Combined, these portfolios account for well under 1% of all equity-fund assets, 
according to Lipper. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, investors prefer to spread their money around the country, rather 
than park it in anybody's back yard.

EARTH DAY CRITIC MISPLACES BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murray Weidenbaum makes one valid point in "Earth Day Celebration Avoids the 
Tough Issues," (April 8): Economics does have an important role to play in 
improving the environment. 
</P>
<P>
His tactic of laying the blame at the feet of the American consumer has 
everything to do with an evident pro-business stance and little to do with 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Weidenbaum cites some statistics about how few Americans buy recycled papers -- 
as if there were a realistic choice. In fact, it is extremely hard to find 
recycled paper products. And it doesn't make much difference that most 
consumers don't use "degradable plastic garbage bags" because these bags, as 
well as biodegradable disposable diapers, do not significantly biodegrade. 
</P>
<P>
Weidenbaum also makes fun of people, such as tree spikers, who cause damage to 
make a point. While many appropriately disagree with tree spiking as a tactic, 
Weidenbaum misses the point. First, spiking does not kill a tree. But cutting 
it down not only kills the tree, but all of the organisms that depend on the 
tree; deforestation silts up (and kills) waterways and causes other harmful 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Earth Day celebration has a lot of functions, including to remind 
Americans that the environmental movement, and the need for it, lives and 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
I could go on, but I'll save a tree by keeping this as short as possible.

PROSECUTING S&amp;L CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this month, the General Accounting Office released its harrowing new 
estimate of what the savings and loan crisis will cost taxpayers: at least $325 
billion and as much as $500 billion over the next 30 to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As bailout costs mount, so does the evidence that fraud played a greater role 
in the fiasco than previously thought. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh estimated 
last week that up to 30% of the S&amp;L failures can be blamed on criminals. He 
called it an "epidemic of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Director William S. Sessions expressed similar views earlier this month in 
testimony before a House Banking Committee hearing in Dallas. He said FBI 
agents have found "pervasive" fraud in the thrift business, which he called a 
"national crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The following are edited excerpts from an interview with Sessions conducted by 
Times staff writer James Bates: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Where did this staggering amount of money go in the cases involving 
fraud? Have your agents been able to trace much of it, or has it just vanished 
forever? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Let me give you some indication of where the money isn't. Obviously in 
land flips, or whatever you call them in California. That is where a piece of 
property might be priced at $1 million a month ago, was sold a week later for 
$2 million and a week later for $3.5 million and a month later for $5.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it has enhanced value that was probably fraudulently placed on that 
land. If it was worth $1 million originally, the land is still there. So even 
though it is later priced and supposedly worth $5.3 million, your loss is $4.3 
million if the land was worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In their testimony, prosecutors in Dallas were pessimistic about how much 
money could be recovered through restitution. What's your view? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is always difficult to find money where these kinds of crimes are 
involved because a great deal of it is spent. If we can find where it was 
secreted and placed, then, of course we've got a chance to get it. But it is 
tough to find assets, and I would agree that the outlook there is generally 
pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Many of the high fliers are still running around and have not been charged. 
The public looks at them and says: "Gee, if these guys were such crooks, how 
come they're not facing charges or in jail?" Why has it taken so long? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think the concern that you expressed, and the public's concern, will be 
addressed in large measure by the application of resources that have been 
provided now by the Congress, and that are in connection with FIRREA (the 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, or thrift bailout 
bill, signed by President Bush last August). 
</P>
<P>
We have 202 allocated new agents, which will take us from around 400 to up 
around 600 agents who are going to be dealing with bank fraud and embezzlement 
cases. We have an additional 100 technicians, and the Department of Justice has 
brought on 118 new assistant U.S. attorneys. The application of those resources 
will help tremendously to hack into that backlog. 
</P>
<P>
Q: With the cost of the bailout rising, are you under any added pressure to 
bring these people to justice? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think there is plenty of incentive for that. A question was asked me the 
other day on my view of the impact on the American public. I said that it was 
my belief that the American public relied upon banking institutions and 
financial institutions being soundly managed by people who were honest. 
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely essential that this program go forward to the end, no matter 
how long it takes. And the statute of limitations is now 10 years (under 
FIRREA, the statute of limitations for certain crimes involving banks, S&amp;Ls 
and credit unions was raised from five years to 10) and we have capable 
resources, so it's very important that we do restore the confidence of the 
American people in their financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why wasn't this fraud spotted earlier? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think you'd have to ask that question more of the agencies that refer 
matters to us. We take the referrals, and those are criminal referrals. But 
until we have them, we don't have them. So the referral process is absolutely 
essential. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have you found any evidence of organized crime involved in thrifts, or drug 
people? Some have written about the CIA being involved in thrifts. Have you 
found any of that in your investigations? 
</P>
<P>
A: Organized crime by its very nature has long had as one of its high 
priorities the taking over of institutions and businesses that legitimize its 
operation. So I don't think there's any question that is always a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But widespread involvement in thrifts? 
</P>
<P>
A: I wouldn't want to speculate on that. As to the money laundering aspects and 
the overseas aspects, obviously people do have money laundering needs. If you 
can take from a drug operation and through a legitimate business, or an 
apparently legitimate business front, launder that money, then of course people 
are going to take those avenues. I think we will find more of that. 
</P>
<P>
As to the involvement of the CIA, I've responded to that before, indicating 
that we have no indication of involvement by the CIA. It may be that some of 
the personnel who are actually involved in these investigations, as 
representing the institutions, may have had some connection. I can't tell you 
that, and I wouldn't want to speculate. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are the people you're looking at for alleged fraud all former executives 
with thrifts, or are some of them public officials? And are there many aside 
from thrift executives? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think you've pegged it correctly. That is, you've said, 'Are there 
outsiders as well as insiders?' We believe we will continue to find that there 
are outsiders involved. There are developers, there are appraisers, there are 
lawyers, there are accountants. All sorts of people outside the institution who 
may have some representative capacity or some developmental capacity in terms 
of condominiums or land sales, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You're tracking down people who committed crimes several years ago. Why is 
it so important now to bring them to justice? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, in five words: confidence of the American public. Confidence of the 
American public in the institutions is based upon belief that those 
institutions are being soundly and legally operated, that those people who 
operate them can be relied upon and that the functions of government for 
oversight, regulation and investigation are being properly carried out. So I 
think it's extremely important and critical that we follow these to the end.

ANTI-ABUSE VACCINE IS THE WRONG APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As are former Secretary of State George Schultz, William F. Buckley, New York 
Times columnist Tom Wicker, Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Freidman and 
many others, I am for legalizing drugs. And taking the profit out of drug sales 
is the only way to begin the control of such sales. 
</P>
<P>
However, the most compelling argument for legalization is not the economic 
argument. It happens to be the answer to Michael Schrage's second question: 
"Why government oversight of cocaine sales is morally superior to insisting 
that children get inoculated." 
</P>
<P>
The logical answer is obvious to any clear-thinking freedom-lover: To insist 
that children get inoculated is a forced intrusion on the bodies of our 
citizens whereas government oversight of cocaine sales simply allows each 
individual the freedom to choose, the very basis for free Western democracies.

SOCIAL ELITE'S VALUES AT WORK IN PARTY SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeannine Stein's "Party Politics" (April 15) spotlights the shallow values of 
the powerful social elite. 
</P>
<P>
These Southern Californians make the frivolous, wealthy New Yorkers in Tom 
Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities" look semi-sincere. Even Wolfe's fictional 
hosts didn't hire plainclothes detectives to keep their esteemed guests from 
pilfering the jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The values underlying the lifestyles of the socially correct and powerful 
leaders in your society section frighten me. 
</P>
<P>
If the poor aspire to the pompous, materialistic lifestyles of these successful 
trend-setters, the chasm between the two groups will continue growing 
dangerously more ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's why the socialites are hiring security personnel to walk their 
guests to their cars.

PLIGHT OF ANOTHER AIRLINE EMPLOYEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing regarding the article Bettijane Levine wrote on "Weight Concerns 
at Work" (April 17). I also work for American Airlines, but in reservation 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
For many years I have wanted to become an airport or city ticket agent, but 
because of my weight an application for those positions would never be 
accepted. With all my years of experience doing my job, I feel I am as 
qualified as anyone to become a ticket agent. However, because I don't measure 
up to or down to what their charts say I should be physically, I have been 
denied this job. 
</P>
<P>
At this point in time I am being put in a real bind. The Los Angeles 
reservation office is closing and moving to Tucson for economic reasons. I 
cannot transfer to Tucson, or out of the Los Angeles area because my husband 
and family are firmly established here. They will not accept a job application 
from me for the position I would like to have to remain with the company, so I 
may be forced to take a very small severance when they finally leave. 
</P>
<P>
I will lose all my increased pension and other benefits that I have worked over 
21 years to build and maintain. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines has always been an extremely good company to work for, but 
recently I feel really betrayed.

WORD OF HIS DEMISE WAS PREMATURE

<TEXT>
<P>
Re: The "late" Lawrence Clark Powell. 
</P>
<P>
In the April 8 View section you printed a letter to the editor that referred to 
the "late Lawrence Clark Powell, UCLA Librarian." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, April 8, Lawrence Clark Powell was not only not dead, he was having 
a party -- attended by almost 1,000 -- at Singing Wind Bookshop in Benson, 
Ariz., to celebrate the publication of his latest book, "Southwest: Three 
Definitions."

In 1890, Robert M. Teague founded the San Dimas Citrus Nurseries. By 1906, he 
was operating the largest citrus nursery in the world, shipping trees to 
growers all over the world. His trees won gold medals at four international 
expositions.

CRIME DATA OFFERS HOPE FOR SCHOOLS;

<P>
EDUCATION: A STATE SURVEY SHOWS FEWER CASES OF DRUG-RELATED INCIDENTS AND 
WEAPONS POSSESSION IN THREE WESTSIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LAST YEAR.

Parents of children who attend school in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Culver 
City may be able to breathe a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
Drug use and weapons possession generally are on the decline in the Beverly 
Hills, Santa Monica and Culver City school districts, according to a recent 
crime survey released by the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
In the Culver City Unified School District, weapons-possession incidents 
dropped nearly 60% in 1988-89 from the previous school year, according to the 
report. In 1988-89, 11 guns, knives and other weapons were found in the 
4,500-student district, compared to 26 the year before and 22 in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen weapons were reported among the 9,300 students in the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Unified School District, compared to 24 in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills, with a student population of 4,700, had seven weapons-possession 
incidents, two more than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Los Angeles Unified School District, reports of guns on or near 
campuses rose by 8% to 274 in 1988-89, and over the last four years by a 
whopping 271%, up from 75 in 1985-86. Reports of other weapons dipped 1% from 
last year, but have jumped by 122% over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say they are unsure why Los Angeles and the smaller districts 
are experiencing opposite trends in weapons incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Drug use appears to be waning in schools statewide, officials said. Los Angeles 
campuses had a 20% decline in 1988-89 from the previous year. Beverly Hills 
schools reported four incidents in which drugs were involved, down from 15 the 
year before. The Culver City and Santa Monica districts each had about an 80% 
drop, to fewer than 10 cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could tell you we did something specifically," said Nardy Samuels, 
principal of Santa Monica High School, where drug use fell from 32 incidents to 
five. "I think it's a trend nationwide, not just here." Or, he said, "kids are 
either real slick in not getting caught, or they leave their drugs at home." 
</P>
<P>
The crime figures, ordered by the state Legislature in 1984, are reported to 
the state by individual school districts. The accuracy of the statistics has 
been questioned by some education and law enforcement officials, who point to 
discrepancies among schools in discipline and enforcement. Santa Monica High 
School reported an increase in assaults, from 60 in 1987-'88 to 81 the next 
year. But, Samuels said, that increase could have been due in part to the 
turnover of four administrators during that period. "Maybe the system of 
reporting was different," said Samuels, who became principal in the 1988-89 
school year. Reported assaults in Culver City fell 16%, to 77 cases in the 
1988-89 year. Beverly Hills had 26 assaults, four more than the previous year. 
Assault is defined as everything from spontaneous shoving matches to 
premeditated attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In compiling the figures for all the categories, the districts only count cases 
that lead to student suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
"Duty cleaning up the yard or the cafeteria" or some other kind of punishment 
would not show up, said Nancy Wolf, director of special pupil services for the 
Beverly Hills district. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes suspension is not the answer," but talking to the students is, says 
Terry Pearson, director of pupil services for the Santa Monica-Malibu schools. 
</P>
<P>
The state statistics may also be misleadingly low, Samuels said, because 
law-breaking students are not always caught. The high school reported to the 
state only four incidents of vandalism -- which Samuels said was graffiti -- 
but the school walls show otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"We have graffiti artists, mostly in the bathrooms, mostly the boys'. . . . But 
we don't catch them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, two thefts and no burglaries were reported at the school, but Samuels 
said in fact there had been more. 
</P>
<P>
"Things happen very quickly, are not reported, identified, recognized. Kids try 
to (hide), especially when they know someone's coming," he said. And, he said, 
students don't like to snitch on their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics seem to indicate that each of the three Westside school districts 
had a trademark crime in 1988-'89. Culver City reported 240 instances of 
vandalism, a 50% increase from the year before, involving 76 students and 
costing the district $22,333. Santa Monica-Malibu had eight cases of arson, 
seven of which were fires set in garbage cans at the high school, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
The state survey lists 21 sex offenses on Beverly Hills campuses, but Wolf said 
that number was incorrect, blaming the discrepancy on a computer error. She 
said there were actually four cases: three obscene telephone calls or indecent 
exposures, and one instance in which a man approached a student sitting on the 
school lawn, touched her shoe, and asked her to get into his car. 
</P>
<P>
Incidents of campus crime overall dropped one-third in the Santa Monica-Malibu 
district between 1988-89 and the prior year. It rose 3% in Culver City and 13% 
in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
School crime in Los Angeles was down 16%, but statewide, it increased 5%.

DUARTE COUNCIL DOES ITS FIGHTING ON COURT 
</P>

<P>
Once a week, City Council members take each other to court. The wallyball 
court, that is. 
</P>
<P>
While other city councils bicker and argue during their regular meetings, the 
Duarte officials do their battling during wallyball games that precede their 
meetings. Wallyball, invented in 1979, is an indoor version of volleyball in 
which players are allowed to bounce the ball off side walls. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd rather beat up on each other here than during the council meetings," said 
Councilman John Van Doren, one of the founders of the game, which started as a 
Tuesday afternoon tradition before the twice-monthly council meetings. It 
proved so popular that now members play every week, council meeting or not. 
</P>
<P>
Since Van Doren and Councilman John Hitt started it four years ago, the 
wallyball game has become something of a council rite of passage. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started on the council, I was told that I wouldn't be official 
until I played the game," said Councilman James Kirchner, who was elected to 
the council last November. 
</P>
<P>
Van Doren, who has served on the council 12 years, jokes that participation in 
the wallyball game should be a job requirement, "but the council hasn't voted 
on that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Since the games started after the 1986 elections, council members dressed in 
shorts and T-shirts have become a common sight around the Duarte Town Center, 
where the city-owned Duarte Fitness Center sits next to the auditorium, which 
serves as council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Council members usually start arriving at the center two hours before their 
meetings to play wallyball. They finish the game by about 6:30 p.m., hop in the 
showers, get dressed in traditional dark suits and ties and start their 
meetings at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ginny Joyce, the lone woman on the five-member council, is the only member who 
refuses to join the game, ritual or no ritual. "When I was first elected I 
played in a practice game, and I went home all bruised up," she said. "That's 
when I decided this wasn't for me." 
</P>
<P>
She said boycotting the wallyball sessions does not make her feel left out of 
the council mainstream. She adds that she gets her exercise from walking. 
</P>
<P>
Before the coming of wallyball, Van Doren and Hitt used to play racquetball 
together. Then they heard about wallyball, which is enjoying a certain 
trendiness lately, with even President Bush reported to enjoy playing the sport 
at Camp David. They decided to get the whole council involved. Soon, friends 
and relatives started joining the game, in which each side has from two to four 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"We always make sure that there are citizens around, so we could conduct our 
meetings down here, and it's all in the open," Mayor John Fasana said with a 
chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Hill, an assistant state attorney general, said the wallyball sessions 
do not violate the state's open meetings law unless official business is 
discussed on the court. 
</P>
<P>
And council members say they never do that. 
</P>
<P>
"This helps us relieve a lot of tension before the meetings," Fasana said. "And 
it gives us a chance to associate with each other outside the council. . . . 
We've gotten to know each other a lot better because of this."

THE CLASS OF 1940;

<P>
CLASSMATES RECALL DISCIPLINE, PRANKS AT ST. PHILIP'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some former students at St. Philip's School in Pasadena were poking through the 
school building the other day, peering into empty classrooms and breathing in 
the familiar smell of chalk and paste. 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed in the past 50 years, they noted. The inkwells are gone 
from the desks, the basement cafeteria has been turned into a day-care center, 
and the furniture in the old eighth-grade classroom, up on the second floor 
across the hall from the library, has been scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
"All the desks were facing north when we were here," said Malcolm Brown, 
surveying the present loose arrangement of movable desks, turned roughly toward 
the east. 
</P>
<P>
But the old place on Hill Avenue was still recognizable, said Father Damian 
McHale, looking pensively at the long, narrow coatroom next to the classroom 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Many's the time I remember standing right here," he said. "Probably for doing 
things you weren't supposed to be doing," said James Link, merrily disrupting 
the mood. "You were such a bully." 
</P>
<P>
Talk for half an hour to members of the St. Philip's graduating class of 1940, 
and you start thinking you're in an old Mickey Rooney movie. Gray-haired and 
close to retirement, most of them, they transport you back to a time when the 
big trouble-makers in school were the kids who talked in class or played on the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen of the 16 graduating eighth-graders will get together today for a 50th 
reunion of the class of 1940. They'll eat a potluck dinner, look at slides of 
past reunions, gather at a reception and attend Mass, with the class's two 
priests joining St. Philip's pastor, Msgr. Gary Bauler, as co-celebrants. 
</P>
<P>
Then they'll probably do a lot of reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of former teachers will even put in appearances. Sister Mary Joan 
Patrice, a fresh-faced novice teacher in 1940, will fly in from Denver. "We all 
grew up together," she said in a letter to one of the classmates. 
</P>
<P>
And the energetic seventh-grade teacher Sister Mary Victory, who was known on 
occasion to slide into class like a baserunner stealing second, will travel 
from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"She was strict," recalled Ray Somerlott, a retired Pacific Bell marketing 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"You needed that, Ray," McHale snapped good-naturedly. "You really needed it." 
</P>
<P>
It seems like yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
They were a wholesome bunch, poised precariously between the Great Depression 
and World War II, but overwhelmingly preoccupied with adolescent concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Marso, now a nun with the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin 
Mary, the same order that staffs the school's faculty, has dug up some old 
letters she had written to a friend. There were detailed descriptions of her 
classmates and blow-by-blow accounts of how the teachers kept all of that 
youthful energy directed at math and history. 
</P>
<P>
"But in all the letters, I didn't mention the war once," she marveled. "I don't 
think we felt threatened by it." 
</P>
<P>
They weren't above some mischief now and then. Somerlott in particular seemed 
always to be in hot water with the nuns. "I was the class cut-up," he 
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
A bruiser of a youngster who could throw a football practically the length of 
the school's playing field, Somerlott was as frisky as a bear cub. "You'd be 
standing innocently in the schoolyard, and suddenly you'd be flying through the 
air," recalled Brown, an executive with an Arcadia aerospace firm. "Ray was 
learning judo." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wozniak, now a priest at the San Gabriel Mission, was another cut-up. 
"Jitterbug," as some of the girls referred to him, got nabbed by the nuns once 
for playing on the roof when he should have been washing windows. 
</P>
<P>
School work was demanding enough. "The girls had all the brains," said McHale, 
the chaplain at the Long Beach Naval Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Marso shrugged. "I just worked hard," she said. "I thought everybody was 
smarter than me, so I had to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most vivid memories were associated with being forced to step out 
from the group. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Franciscus, the music teacher, thought she perceived some singing talent 
in David Fritz. First she gave him private lessons, then she recruited him to 
sing "Ave Maria" for a school assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced," said Fritz, a retired 
sheriff's deputy and private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Riedel, asked to write down some of her memories of St. Philip's, 
recalled one particularly painful experience. "I remember in the eighth grade," 
she wrote, "when I had to dance the minuet with Malcolm Brown. So 
embarrassing!" 
</P>
<P>
Somerlott was called upon once to render "Mother McCree" on the piano. 
Mid-performance, he forgot how the song ended. "I must have played the tune 12 
or 14 times," he recalled, "until I finally just hit the keys real hard and got 
up." 
</P>
<P>
The approaching war, in which most of the boys eventually saw active duty, may 
have seemed like a distant thunderstorm, its rumble barely audible in their 
busy lives. But the classmates did feel the lingering effects of hard times. 
</P>
<P>
"Money was hard to come by," said James Link, a medical supplies salesman from 
Altadena. Most of the classmates held after-school jobs. Marso worked as a 
baby-sitter, McHale washed glasses and silverware at a local restaurant, and 
Link worked at two plant nurseries. "I moved plants around for about 50 cents a 
week," said Link. "Remember, in those days you could buy five pieces of candy 
for a nickel." 
</P>
<P>
But the envy of the class was Brown, who worked as a stand-in for child movie 
actor Freddie Bartholomew. Brown didn't exactly rate as a movie star. "Next to 
it," said Somerlott. 
</P>
<P>
He was also the owner, in the days when driver's licenses were issued to 
14-year-olds, of a rattletrap of a Model A Ford. "I couldn't afford real paint, 
so I used this green stuff that they used on tree stumps," Brown said. "I 
painted it with that terrible goop, then put polka dots all over it. I 
eventually traded the car for a bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
The classmates went on to high schools -- many of them to Woodrow Wilson High 
in Pasadena -- colleges and careers. But most of them have kept in touch, 
getting together for weddings, ordinations, graduations, reunions and funerals. 
Two of them -- James Pfeiler and Robert Woodward -- have died. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors have watched the world change around them. "At Woodrow Wilson 
High School, there were 500 or 600 in the graduating class," said Somerlott. 
"There were two kids who smoked cigarettes and one who owned a car. Look at 
today's ninth- and 10th-graders." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that was the big difference, said Marso, a friendly woman with the sane 
ingenuous smile she displayed 50 years ago. "We learned to be content with 
fewer things," she said. "There wasn't a lot that we hankered for."

CRAFTING GIFTS FROM NATURE'S STOREHOUSE 
</P>

<P>
She has sketched the 300,000-year-old bones of ancient man and drawn the 
fossils of the extinct ground sloth. She has peered through a microscope at the 
hairs on a fly in a painstaking search for artistic accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Now Danish-born scientific illustrator Inger Achton Dix is channeling her 
creative energies in another direction: She makes whimsical creatures from 
nature's storehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Dix, 80, heads a group of 10 other volunteers who craft gifts from peacock 
feathers, twigs and seed pods at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
They work in a wooden shed nestled in the 127-acre garden. Their all-natural 
creations -- from painted walnut-shell skunks to prickly poodles fashioned from 
liquidambar pods -- bring in more than $3,000 a year for the arboretum's gift 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
"We make funny little animals," Dix said, holding up what looked like a cross 
between an aardvark and an armadillo, formed from eucalyptus pods, with stems 
of magnolia seedpods for legs. The creature, like other whimsical animals in 
the menagerie, sells for $2.95 to $4. Other handcrafted items are priced from 
$1 for vases of straw flowers to $30 for basket arrangements and wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we do buy ribbon or silk flowers to add a bit of color," she 
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Dix attended art schools in Copenhagen and Berlin. After she graduated, a 
zoologist taught her scientific illustration. 
</P>
<P>
She was hired to catalogue the 3,000-piece Mongolian collection of Danish 
explorer Henning Haslund-Christensen at the National Museum of Copenhagen, 
faithfully reproducing the ornate headdresses, tents and household items on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, she arrived in New York with $50 in her pocket and started work at the 
Museum of Natural History. Her job was to sketch fossils for anthropologist 
Franz Weidenreich. 
</P>
<P>
Then she moved to Caltech, where she drew the bones of the ground sloth. She 
stopped working as a professional illustrator in 1952 but continued to draw and 
paint for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971 she exchanged her paintbrush and India ink for seeds, flowers and a 
glue applicator when she joined the arboretum's 300-member volunteer corps. But 
she hasn't lost her scrupulous attention to detail, and agonizes over traces of 
glue on the crafts. 
</P>
<P>
"She gives it everything she's got," said Grace Robinson, another volunteer in 
the crafts group, which meets Tuesday mornings. "She's very fastidious about 
what she makes. Everything has to be in good order before she lets it go to the 
gift shop." 
</P>
<P>
Dix estimates she spends about 50 to 70 hours a week at her arboretum "job." In 
addition, she pots plants at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and 
Botanical Gardens in San Marino and performs folk dances several times a year 
at Danish clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I work harder now as a retiree than when I was paid!" she said. "I can't sit 
still. I have to work with my hands."

Long Beach City College is one of 10 community colleges in the nation selected 
to participate in an educational partnership with Apple Computer. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership grants each college $100,000 in computer equipment and two 
years to implement an aspect of computerized education in which it will be a 
national leader, sharing its materials with other colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach City College, using a software program called Hypercard, will 
develop state-of-the-art student learning labs at eight existing centers 
throughout the college. 
</P>
<P>
Hypercard is described as more effective than traditional library or computer 
learning because it can combine sound, color and motion to hold a student's 
attention and increase learning speed and retention of information.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sylvia Rodriguez's 14-year-old son barely survived his first year with a gang, 
during which he was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery, suffered a bullet 
wound and overdosed on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Now Rodriguez, 42, is raising a grandchild and wants to avoid the same history. 
So this mother of five has joined a parenting class. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other 13 women and five men in her 10-week class, she seeks a sound 
relationship with the child she is rearing. 
</P>
<P>
The Pico Rivera class, in Smith Park's auditorium, is a prototype for a project 
that could become regionwide, a program with the premise that gang prevention 
begins at home. 
</P>
<P>
Gang identification often begins when a child emerges from his home without 
self-esteem or adequate support, said Andy Anderson, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department sergeant who organized the class. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson directs the Paramount-based Consolidated Youth Services Network, which 
provides free counseling for juveniles. Fourteen cities, including Cerritos, 
Downey, Norwalk and Whittier, take part in network programs. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson started the parenting class with about $3,000 in anti-gang money left 
over from state and federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
"Prevention is the best means to attack the problem," said Anderson, a 31-year 
veteran of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Garcia is one parent who hopes to forestall problems. Three of Garcia's 
younger brothers became gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my children these are your uncles, and you need to respect them, but I 
don't want you to be like them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another brother resisted gang membership, and gang members beat him. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of her three children is 13. They "are still at an age where I can 
control them," the 32-year-old dental assistant said. "When they are 17 . . . " 
She paused. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know if those parents who have children already involved in 
gangs, if they will benefit very much." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Torres worries that the class may be too little, too late. Torres, a 
36-year-old single parent, said her 16-year-old daughter will not abide by a 1 
a.m. curfew, nor will she go to counseling. 
</P>
<P>
As for the parenting class, "she just said it was a joke that I should be 
taking this extra step to understand her. 
</P>
<P>
"My worst fear is that she'd get hooked on drugs, meet up with the wrong person 
one day. You never know what's out there on the street. It scares me. 
</P>
<P>
"She went to the same high school I did, and it's not the same," Torres said, 
because of the increase in drug and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The playing field has changed for the parenting game, psychologist Karen Laski 
said to her class of parents. "We tell them to do something and they don't. And 
we don't know why because (we say,) 'That worked when I was a kid.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda Avalos said her son justifies his defiance of authority with, "I didn't 
get arrested. I'm not drinking. I'm not doing drugs. I'm doing well in school." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Avalos said, "he's making Ds, and because he's not failing, he says 
he's doing well. It's like if I punish him, he's going to get back at me by 
failing." 
</P>
<P>
"Misbehavior stems from not belonging, not feeling a part of the family," Laski 
says. "It's a way of compensation, communication. Look at it as a form of 
communication. It's important that you identify the goal of the misbehavior." 
</P>
<P>
She talks about focusing on encouragement and bending on unimportant issues to 
emphasize more important values. She believes that children learn 
responsibility when they must face the consequences of their actions. 
</P>
<P>
These consequences, however, should not be expressed as punishment, which seems 
arbitrary to children or a put-down. 
</P>
<P>
She uses "The Parent's Handbook" as a text. It's part of a program called 
Systematic Training for Effective Parenting. The course is free. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson hopes to enlarge enrollment so parent groups can be segregated by the 
ages of the children. He intends to start classes in other places and to offer 
the course in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The sooner the better, said Garcia, who became a parent at age 19. "Doctors and 
psychologists go to classes to learn about childhood development," she said. 
"And we go by trial and error, and now we want help." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez considers herself fortunate that her son survived gang membership -- 
so far -- and that he now wants out. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she sees the boys congregate at an apartment building two blocks from 
her door and in the riverbed nearby. She thinks about the parents of those many 
youngsters and marvels at the size of her parenting class. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised it had such a small turnout," she said.

NEWSPAPER COLLECTOR STUDIES HIS HISTORY FIRSTHAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Washington is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly front-page news? 
</P>
<P>
To John Eplett, it is. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett read all about it on the front page of the Dec. 25 edition of the 
Columbian (Mass.) Centinel. But the news cost him more than a quarter. Eplett 
paid $300 for the paper, which was printed in 1799. 
</P>
<P>
To some, Washington's death is just old news. But to Eplett, who collects old 
newspapers, it's history. 
</P>
<P>
"The legacy of the father of his country," Eplett reads aloud from the paper, 
which is bordered by a black line in memory of the President. "Washington is no 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Eplett has read the article dozens of times, but he's still incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe they were already calling him the father of our country -- 
less than two weeks after he died?" 
</P>
<P>
Eplett, who lives in Van Nuys, owns more than 500 historical papers, mostly 
from the 18th and 19th centuries. His collection chronicles the murder trial of 
Jesse James, Custer's last stand, the capture of Confederate President 
Jefferson Davis and the sinking of the Titanic. It also provides insight into 
the everyday concerns of early Americans, including bad breath and hemorrhoids. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't miss a thing," says Eplett, 54, who uses a magnifying glass to read 
the early papers, which are printed in very small type. "I read every single 
word, including the advertisements." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper collectors are as rare as many of the papers themselves. There are 
only a few hundred serious collectors in the country and only a handful in Los 
Angeles. "People don't like the bulk," says Richard Robinson, a collector from 
West Los Angeles, whose several thousand newspapers are stored in acid-free 
plastic envelopes in several locations. "It's not like stamps or coins, where 
you can have an entire collection in a few drawers." 
</P>
<P>
But collectors say it's a lot more rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Eplett sold his entire gold and silver coin collection, worth about 
$60,000, to buy newspapers. "I thought coins were interesting," he says, "but 
they don't hold a candle to newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Eplett admits that at first he was just trying to make money selling the 
papers. "But then I realized I was dealing with American history," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he says, he's looking for organizations interested in displaying his 
collection, so others can share in the thrill of reading history firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is considering showing the 
collection at its museum in Whittier, according to Sheriff's Sgt. Linda 
Edmunds. Eplett is lucky he turned out to be a history buff because, as far as 
making money, he might have sunk like the Titanic. There's just not a great 
demand for old newspapers, and most are worth only a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The rarest ones, however, command a few thousand, and newspaper collectors can 
compete as fiercely as rival reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of viciousness that goes on," says Charles Nemzer, a collector 
from Beverly Hills, whose newspapers span 1717 to 1865. "People would cut their 
arms off to get some papers." 
</P>
<P>
The most sought-after papers are those about President Abraham Lincoln's death. 
"It's still just like he died yesterday," says Nemzer, who owns one printed the 
night before Lincoln was shot, announcing that the President would be attending 
Ford's Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett buys his papers from dealers, university archives, private collectors 
and newspaper libraries. He says he has spent about $60,000 and estimates that 
his collection is worth more than $400,000 retail. But other collectors say 
that's an exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
The value of a newspaper, collectors say, depends on its condition, the 
importance of the event reported, the rarity of the paper and how soon after an 
event the article appeared. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Eplett says, the ultimate newspaper reporting the death of John 
F. Kennedy would be one published in Dallas on the same day. Similarly, 
although the Dec. 25 paper lamenting Washington's death is valuable, Eplett 
could get more for one published closer to Washington's death, which occurred 
Dec. 14, 1799. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett's most valuable paper is one published before the event -- the Chicago 
Daily Tribune's embarrassing blunder of Nov. 3, 1948, when a banner headline 
proclaimed, "Dewey Defeats Truman." 
</P>
<P>
The paper, free of brown spots and tears, is worth more than $3,000, Eplett 
says. But Nemzer and Robinson say it's worth only $400. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Eplett's early papers are in top-notch condition because, until the 
Civil War, newspapers were made of rags and linen instead of wood pulp. "They 
don't get brittle," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett says he gets as big a thrill reading the advertisements as he does the 
articles -- particularly the ads for cure-all medicines, which dominated papers 
of the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"How many suffer torture day after day, making life a burden and robbing 
existence of all pleasure owing to the secret suffering of piles?" says an ad 
for Simmon's Liver Regulator in the 1876 Denison (Tex.) Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
The medicine, according to the ad, was intended to cure ailments such as bad 
breath, constipation and headaches. "Do not neglect so sure a remedy for these 
repulsive disorders," the ad warns. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett also owns a newspaper with an ad for Dr. John Greenwood, the dentist who 
made Washington's false teeth, and another with an ad for Lincoln's law office. 
</P>
<P>
Although references to famous people excite Eplett, he says he learns more 
about American culture and mores from incidents involving ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers with articles about ordinary people aren't worth much, but, Eplett 
said, to him the firsthand accounts are a priceless look at the culture and 
attitudes of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"These are things," he says, "that you just don't read about in books or see in 
the movies."

NEW SOUTH GATE COUNCIL SCRAPS FRESH JOB POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two veteran councilmen and three newly elected members moved quickly Monday to 
undo some decisions of the departed City Council majority. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which last week held its first full meeting since the April 10 
election, scrapped a plan -- approved on the eve of the election -- to give top 
appointive officials, including the city administrator and city attorney, more 
job protection and an improved severance package. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Bruce Boogaard, in particular, had increasingly been criticized by 
some council members, with some candidates suggesting during the campaign that 
administrators would be fired if the balance of power changed on the 
five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
The balance did change when voters elected three newcomers. One incumbent, 
Mayor Herbert W. Cranton, was defeated. Two other incumbents did not seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted to remove two advisory measures from the June 5 election 
ballot and hired a special attorney -- at $150 an hour -- to provide advice on 
the legality of such an effort and other legal matters. 
</P>
<P>
The new council majority was more comfortable calling on another attorney for 
advice on some matters and wanted to avoid creating a possible conflict of 
interest for the city attorney, Mayor Robert A. Philipp said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Leonard said Boogaard played a major role in writing the 
ballot measures and the job-security resolution, and so stood to benefit from 
the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard emphasized, however, that no administrator has been fired. "We haven't 
terminated anybody," he said. "The city attorney has not been relieved of any 
of his duties." 
</P>
<P>
The council hired attorney William Rudell as a special legal counsel at $150 an 
hour but limited the total contract to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Council veterans Philipp and Gregory Slaughter joined new council members 
Johnny Ramirez, Mary Ann Buckles and Leonard in the voting to rescind the 
job-protection measure and to try to remove the ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
Philipp and Slaughter voted for the election-eve resolution. Philipp said he 
reversed his position after examining the former council's action more 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad measure," he said. "This should be part of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, administrators could have been fired only for 
work-related causes or for committing a felony. Administrators would have been 
given 60 days' notice of termination, plus paid leaves of up to six months to 
search for another job. 
</P>
<P>
Then-council members Cranton, Odell L. Snavely and William H. DeWitt also voted 
for the resolution. Snavely and DeWitt did not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Cranton criticized the council's decision to hire a special 
attorney: "It is stupid for them to hire a legal counsel for that price when we 
already have a city attorney." The former mayor said Philipp has a "personal 
vendetta" against the city attorney and other top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Philipp declined to discuss the issue, saying it is a "personnel matter." And 
neither Boogaard nor city administrator Bruce Spragg would comment. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Boogaard said he thought his job was secure. 
</P>
<P>
Philipp and Slaughter had split with the old council majority over the issue of 
placing two advisory measures on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
One measure asks voters whether they would approve of developing 7.14 acres of 
vacant city land into an auto sales lot. The other measure asks voters whether 
they would favor providing loans to local metal-fabricating companies. 
</P>
<P>
The former council majority approved the ballot measures, even though both 
issues were moot. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile dealer Pete Ellis had withdrawn plans to develop an auto sales lot 
on the vacant land after residents of a nearby mobile home park protested. 
Shultz Steel officials had sought a $2-million loan from the city to pay for 
plant construction but withdrew the request. 
</P>
<P>
New council member Buckles, in voting to remove the ballot measures, said: 
"Pete Ellis pulled out of the deal. Why put something on the ballot that no one 
wants any more?" 
</P>
<P>
The special attorney has been asked to determine whether it is too late for the 
measures to be removed from the ballot by the county registrar of voters.

BITTER RACE TAKES LEGAL TWIST WITH LIBEL SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
LONG BEACH: THE CONTROVERSY STEMS FROM A BROCHURE THAT ALLEGES COUNCIL 
CANDIDATE JIM SERLES SOLD HIS VOTE.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of this city's nastier council races took a bitter turn last week when it 
was revealed that Belmont Shore-area candidate Jim Serles is suing his 
opponent, Doug Drummond, for $6 million, claiming Drummond libeled him in 
campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a Drummond campaign brochure that says Serles struck "back-room 
deals" and sold his vote to developers while sitting as chairman of the city's 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed the day before the April 10 election when Drummond, a 
retired police commander, forced Serles -- a prominent dentist who had been 
heavily favored to win the 3rd District seat -- into a June runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates kept the lawsuit quiet until Drummond hand-carried it to 
reporters last week. 
</P>
<P>
Serles would not discuss the suit, which says the Drummond campaign exposed him 
to "hatred, contempt (and) ridicule" while damaging his dental practice, his 
Planning Commission chairmanship and his bid for the council seat. 
</P>
<P>
Serles said he prefers to focus on issues that concern the district, which 
includes the affluent Belmont Shore and Naples communities. "I prefer to 
concentrate on the issues and let the lawsuit go to trial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond dismissed the lawsuit as "frivolous" and said it "intends to chill my 
involvement in the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that I told the truth in every aspect of this case, and that is the 
best defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Libel suits within an election campaign are rare because the courts hold public 
officials, such as political candidates, to a higher standard, Los Angeles 
libel attorney Steve Contopulos explained. The statements must be shown to be 
"knowingly false" or made with "reckless disregard for the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Serles' attorney, Philip R. Recht, could not be reached for comment. But the 
suit contends Drummond made statements that are false. 
</P>
<P>
The brochure begins with a full-standing photo of Serles emblazoned with the 
words "FOR SALE." It also includes a newspaper clipping that says Serles broke 
a state law and a comic strip by cartoonist David Horsey, both of which were 
fictionalized by Drummond, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
The brochure compares Serles to state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, who was recently 
convicted of racketeering, extortion and money laundering, and to Board of 
Equalization member Paul Carpenter, who is under indictment for racketeering, 
extortion and conspiracy, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond acknowledged in an interview that the newspaper clipping was invented 
by his campaign and was never, in fact, published. The Horsey cartoon, which 
suggests that Serles allowed a 12-story high-rise to go up in a residential 
neighborhood in exchange for campaign money, was a bona fide cartoon altered to 
include Serles' name, Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
But Drummond refused to discuss whether such tactics were inappropriate, as the 
lawsuit contends. "It's with my lawyer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The race for the 3rd District seat being vacated by Jan Hall was expected to be 
an easy victory for Serles, who is making his third bid for the job. He had the 
endorsement of every mainstream organization in town and a high profile as 
Planning Commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Then Drummond produced allegations that Serles had accepted campaign 
contributions in excess of $250 from developers and other businesses before 
voting in favor of projects they brought before the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
All but two of the charges were proved unfounded. In those two cases, Serles 
said he cast his vote by mistake without realizing he had received campaign 
contributions from the parties involved. The city prosecutor concluded after an 
investigation that Serles had not acted "in bad faith" and cleared him of any 
criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission is looking into a complaint 
brought by Drummond, but no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Serles said the allegations damaged him in the community and at the polls, and 
he is seeking $1 million in general damages and $5 million in punitive damages.

BEACH-BUILDING EFFORT DOESN'T CUT IT; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: SAND FILLED WITH BROKEN GLASS IS DUMPED ON THE BEACH NEAR THE 
PIER. AN ALERT RESIDENT WARNS THE CITY, WHICH ADMITS IT GOOFED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wasn't it odd, thought Peter Sorensen, that Santa Monica city trucks were 
scooping up loads of sand chock-full of broken glass and dumping them onto the 
beach a stone's throw away from the Pacific Ocean? 
</P>
<P>
And so soon after the much celebrated Earth Day, no less? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was odd, Santa Monica officials sheepishly admitted this week. In fact, 
it was a mistake, and a fairly big one at that, according to John Lynd, Santa 
Monica park superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"First time I know of," Lynd said. "There is too much glass out there in the 
sand, yes. . . . It's not a good situation." 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that an angry call from Sorensen to park officials Wednesday 
resulted in the emergency dispatching of a glass clean-up crew to the sandy 
area just north of the Santa Monica Pier -- the site of Sunday's Earth Day 
bash. 
</P>
<P>
At least two tractors with sand-combing devices, two special sand-sifters and a 
dump truck spent a few hours crisscrossing a patch of sand larger than a 
football field, looking for the innumerable shards of glass that had collected 
there. 
</P>
<P>
As they did so, Sorensen, his long blond hair billowing in the breeze, ran 
nimbly among them, holding aloft handfuls of shards and pointing to patches of 
tainted sand he thought the workers had missed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tremendously dangerous," Sorensen said. "I live here and go to the 
beach barefoot every day." 
</P>
<P>
The affair started Tuesday afternoon when Sorensen, a writer whose apartment 
overlooks the beach, gazed out his window. He noticed a front-end loader 
scooping up trash-flecked sand from a 40-foot swath of beach that was separated 
from the main beach by a bike path. Next to the tainted sand was a crowded 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Once the truck was filled, it would proceed to the beach area, and dump. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this happen about twice (Tuesday) and was writing a letter about it to 
the mayor," Sorensen said Wednesday. "Today they were continuing to do more, so 
I got on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect this was the last stage of the Earth Day cleanup," Sorensen said. "I 
find it ironic that their last gesture was to dump this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, according to Lynd and beach maintenance supervisor Glen Rogers, the 
tainted sand was being removed because the city plans to pave that portion of 
the beach to enlarge a parking lot. In their effort to conserve the precious 
sand, the workers dumped it without noticing the glass and garbage that had 
accumulated over time. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't see the glass," Rogers said. The reason the sand had so much trash 
and broken glass in it, he said, was that the beach-cleaning machines rarely 
venture onto the sand on the land side of the bike path. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said crews go out daily to clean the sand on most of the beach, and that 
they would have soon removed the glass anyway. 
</P>
<P>
As he watched the sifters sift, Sorensen said he was happy the city had worked 
so quickly and thoroughly to correct its mistake. "I was angry," he said, "but 
now I'm just glad. I guess it's my contribution to Earth Day."

FRONT-RUNNER FAILS TO EMERGE IN ASSEMBLY PRIMARY CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ATTENTION FOCUSES ON GOP IN RACE TO SUCCEED DENNIS BROWN. SO FAR, IT 
IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Halfway through a primary campaign that developed at the last minute, no clear 
front-runner has emerged among the five Republican candidates seeking to 
replace departing Assemblyman Dennis Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the Los Alamitos Republican who had represented the 58th Assembly 
District for 12 years and had a virtual lock on the seat, set off a political 
scramble when he made a surprise announcement last month that he would not seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
None of his would-be GOP successors are known throughout the coastal district 
that stretches from Long Beach to Huntington Beach, making for a race expected 
to remain close through the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just going to come down to the very end," said GOP candidate 
Jeffrey A. Kellogg, a Long Beach city councilman. "You're just going to see a 
mad rush at the very end." 
</P>
<P>
The other Republican candidates are Seymour Alban, a Long Beach physician; Jan 
Hall, an outgoing Long Beach City Council member; Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas 
J. Mays; and Peter E. von Elten, a vice president at Mola Development Corp. in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Attention is focused on the battle for the Republican nomination because there 
is just one Democratic candidate in the heavily Republican district, Luanne W. 
Pryor, and one Libertarian Party candidate, Scott Stier, on the primary ballot. 
Both are from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican who emerges will become the heavy favorite in November, in a 
district in which 51% of registered voters are Republicans, to 39% Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than half of all the district's voters are in its Long Beach 
portion, although most of its Republican voters live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The two Republican candidates who have never run for political office -- Alban 
and Von Elten -- have the most ambitious spending plans for the campaign. Alban 
expects to spend up to $400,000 in the primary; Von Elten's campaign estimates 
his costs could exceed $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The three city government officials running -- Hall, Kellogg and Mays -- 
complain that they will be vastly outspent. They noted, however, that they 
benefit from greater name identification and that Von Elten and Alban require 
more money to win because neither has an obvious political base. 
</P>
<P>
As for issues, the environment has been a hot button in many races this year, 
but it has had special emphasis in this race. The district's shoreline was 
fouled when an anchor tore the bottom of the oil tanker American Trader, 
causing 394,000 gallons of crude to spill into the ocean off Huntington Beach. 
The Orange County portion of the district's shoreline was coated with oil for 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The one candidate who may have benefited politically from the spill is Mays, 
the Huntington Beach mayor. He appeared frequently on local TV as spokesman for 
angry citizens living on and near the affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, along with all of the Republican candidates except Kellogg, has opposed 
more offshore oil drilling and favored more regulation to protect the coast 
from spills. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg, who has worked with his family's oil company operating onshore 
drilling sites, said he does not think that the water off the 58th District 
should accommodate more drilling, but he would not rule out his support for a 
specific project. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take it on a case-by-case" basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, with all of the Republican candidates appealing for environmental 
votes, the district has been represented for 12 years by an assemblyman who was 
rated one of the five worst in the state by the League of Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Linney, the San Francisco-based political director for the league, said 
the campaign to replace Brown is a high priority for the group's leaders, 
because it offers a chance to replace one of their strongest foes with an 
Assembly member more inclined to support them. 
</P>
<P>
Linney said the group plans to question each candidate, which may lead to an 
endorsement in the GOP primary. So far, it has only talked to Alban. "We feel 
fairly comfortable with him as a candidate," Linney said. 
</P>
<P>
Alban is the only Republican candidate who expressed general support for the 
so-called Big Green initiative that qualified Thursday for the November ballot. 
He has stopped short of specifically endorsing it, however, because he views it 
as a campaign tool being used by Democratic gubernatorial candidate John K. Van 
de Kamp, the initiative's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Some other Republicans said they supported parts of the sweeping measure, but 
not all of its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
As a developer, Von Elten has also had to align his background with his 
professed support for environmental concerns. Von Elten, 46 and a Vietnam 
veteran, said he demonstrated his concern for the environment when his company 
paid to clean up a toxic waste dump in Huntington Beach before building houses 
on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a model cleanup and not a penny cost to the taxpayers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, all of the Republicans except Mays are opposed to proposals to 
bar women from seeking abortions. Of the four who support abortion rights, just 
Kellogg was opposed to government funding for poor women seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
At a candidates forum Thursday night in Long Beach, which Kellogg did not 
attend, Mays was the only candidate opposed to some forms of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
"Gun control is not going to solve the crime problem," Mays said. "Criminals 
won't have to wait for a gun." 
</P>
<P>
On Proposition 111, the proposed 9-cent gas tax to pay for transportation 
improvements, all of the Republican candidates supported the measure except 
Kellogg, who said he was unsatisfied with the manner in which the state spends 
the existing gas tax.

<P>
TEMPERANCE: RESIDENTS OF THE WCTU HOME FOR WOMEN AGREE TO ABSTAIN, BUT SAY THEY 
DON'T GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THE FIERY MOVEMENT THAT GAVE THEIR HOME ITS START. 
</P>

Dressed in black, with the sparest hint of lace at her high-collared neck, the 
late Frances E. Willard casts a stern gaze from her portrait in the auditorium 
of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union Home for Women in Eagle Rock. At the 
back of the room are stacks of paperback songbooks, featuring no-nonsense tunes 
such as the "WCTU Fighting Song": 
</P>
<P>
Chase the "Killer Number One" 
</P>
<P>
And get him on the run. 
</P>
<P>
Go forward, soldiers, draw your swords. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle is the Lord's." 
</P>
<P>
But if the ubiquitous Miss Willard could peer through her pince-nez at the 
upright piano, she'd see that the ladies of the WCTU home lately have been 
singing of sentiment instead of sobriety: The book over the keyboard is open to 
the sad, romantic ballad "When You and I Were Young, Maggie." 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, the last of the home's centenarians died. They were the ones 
who remembered the days when women wore white ribbons of temperance as they 
marched down sin-filled streets and through forbidden saloon doors, hatchets 
drawn. 
</P>
<P>
When the WCTU built its retirement home in Eagle Rock, it was assumed that the 
ladies who would dwell there would have devoted their lives to the temperance 
movement. But the golden years of the WCTU faded long ago. Today, residents 
agree not to drink, but say they don't give much thought to the fiery movement 
that gave their home its start. From a peak of more than 700,000 members 
between 1885 and 1920, the membership of the national group has dwindled to 
about 40,000 card-carrying teetotalers. But, despite the loss of many older 
members, the group has held its own in recent years because of a resurgence of 
concern over drunk driving and alcoholism, spokesman Mike Vitucci said from the 
organization's Evanston, Ill., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
On a quiet street in Eagle Rock, at one of just two WCTU retirement homes left 
in the nation (the other is in Kearney, Neb.) no firebrands of the movement 
remain. Many of the home's residents admit that, until they moved in, they 
thought that the WCTU had gone the way of Prohibition more than half a century 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
When activities director Cynthia Paredes arrived in 1981, about 20% of the 
women at the neatly landscaped, antique-furnished home on Norwalk Avenue were 
longtime WCTU members, she said. But no more. 
</P>
<P>
"Very, very few have come to us recently," Paredes said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents must sign a pledge never to smoke or drink in the home, but they do 
not have to join the organization. In fact, advertisements for the retirement 
home highlight the beauty shop, movies and ice cream socials instead of 
temperance, and plainly state, "WCTU MEMBERSHIP NOT REQUIRED." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew nothing about the WCTU until I came here," 89-year-old Harriet 
Wachowski said. 
</P>
<P>
"I make fun of it a lot now," she says with a twinkle in her eye. "Why don't we 
get some guys in here and liven it up a little bit? I'd like to see a little 
dancing. Something lively!" 
</P>
<P>
On the sly, a handful of women at the home admit to indulging in a glass of 
wine when they leave to visit friends or family. Still, administrators insist 
that there has never been a problem with residents succumbing to the wiles of 
demon drink. 
</P>
<P>
The women said they chalked up a victory several years ago when administrators 
of the self-sustaining center persuaded the Southern California WCTU Board of 
Trustees to approve a game they named "Zingo," although the board frowned upon 
another game with a suspiciously similar name and identical rules. 
</P>
<P>
Such frivolity was hardly the order of the day in 1874, when the WCTU was 
founded in Cleveland, dedicated to total abstinence and closure of raucous 
saloons, as well as the less specific ideals of self control, pure thoughts and 
clean habits as called for in one temperance pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Willard, the second national president, led the group's quest for women's 
suffrage, equal rights, child welfare laws and prison reform, alcohol education 
and world peace. Always on the agenda were ways to combat prostitution, 
gambling and smoking, but the greatest enemy remained spirits in any form. The 
group even campaigned against the use of alcohol in perfume. 
</P>
<P>
Interest waxed and waned through the years, with a marked dip during 
Prohibition, when many women dropped their membership, feeling the battle was 
won. In Los Angeles, where the WCTU set down roots in 1883, 10,000 women wore 
white ribbons "for purity and sobriety" in 1923. Today, just 1,500 copies of 
the monthly newsletter are printed. Local chapter officials, however, declined 
to say how may people pay the $5 annual membership dues. 
</P>
<P>
Even the group's leaders say it doesn't have a very high profile. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people are real surprised we're still in business," said Margaret 
Hammarstrom, executive director of the WCTU Home for Women. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by a solid reputation in the medical community and a spotless state 
inspection record, the all-female WCTU Home has managed to thrive even though 
few still remember firsthand Carry Nation's defiant brand of 
tambourine-banging, bottle-smashing, hymn-singing temperance. Of the home's 117 
rooms, 89 are occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Several ground-floor apartments are reserved for upstairs boarders who, in the 
near future, may need to be closer to the first-floor dining room and nursing 
station. Generally, Paredes said, there is a waiting list for rooms with 
private baths, which range from $885 to $1,025 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members have taken pains to make it feel like home. On the wall of each 
room hangs a "Bless this House" needlepoint, and the one in Antonia LaBianca's 
cottage says "Benedice La Casa," because the group thought she'd like it better 
in her native Italian. 
</P>
<P>
Because two-thirds of the residents have no families, they make Christmas gifts 
and get-well cards for each other. One woman who was found living in a garage 
was taught how to write her name. Demure Rose Greenfield, 80, was urged to try 
her hand at crocheting in an attempt to draw her into the companionship of the 
activities group. Her flawless first attempt, a lap robe, is now the pride of 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, business was brisk at the beauty shop, where soft permanent 
waves with pin curls on the side are the style of choice. Bible reading and 
Zingo were listed on the daily schedule; the ladies were mightily pleased with 
both the tapioca pudding and the tender corned beef and cabbage for lunch. In 
the activities circle, bickering broke out about how the count goes for a 
certain head-and-neck exercise dubbed "The Dizzy One." 
</P>
<P>
As they chatted later, the subject turned to moonshine. 
</P>
<P>
Celia Hoffman, 88, remembers her father leading a temperance parade in 
Edinburgh, Va., 11-year-old Celia in the lead. Across her chest, she wore a 
banner that read, "Down with John Barleycorn!" 
</P>
<P>
Things were different for Emily Branon in east Texas, where Daddy had a corn 
liquor still. 
</P>
<P>
"One day we were having lunch and a guy came by and talked my father into 
selling him some hooch," recalls Branon, 78. "He put the bottle in his pocket 
and came right back and arrested him!" 
</P>
<P>
Rumor has it that Al Capone's boys used to deliver gin to the back porch of one 
of the women who lives at the home, but on this particular morning, no one 
'fessed up. 
</P>
<P>
These days at the WCTU home, "Us" magazine shares the reading table with 
"Guideposts" and "Modern Maturity." Ebba Severance, 79, teases her buddy 
Frances Jenkins, 80, about never missing "Dallas" or the scandalous afternoon 
soaps. Zingo regulars marvel at the luck of the longstanding champion, now 
hospitalized, who's won "more postage stamps than you can shake a stick at." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there will never be a happy hour at this retirement home. 
More than a third of the 89 residents have signed the WCTU membership pledge 
since their arrival: "I hereby solemnly promise, God helping me, to abstain 
from all distilled, fermented, and malt liquors, including wine, beer, and hard 
cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the use of and traffic in 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of The Last Supper and Jesus adorn many of the hallways, and one 
spirited resident exits a conversation saying, "Onward Christian Soldiers, 
girls! Keep it together!" 
</P>
<P>
Director Hammarstrom, a longtime WCTU member, folds her hands on her desk and 
makes one point very clear. Things have changed, yes. "But we do not drink. We 
do not. We do not make toasts. We do not drink wine. We do not drink." 
</P>

MAN USES HIS FAITH TO AID GANG MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three days after his 16-year-old son was killed in a February gang shooting, 
Blinky Rodriguez found himself driving through Pacoima. Police suspected a 
rival gang member from this turf had pulled the trigger. Rodriguez said he was 
drawn to these streets. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are falling out every day. My son is lying in a grave. Ten days 
ago, another kid went down," Rodriguez said recently. "Who will stand in these 
perilous times?" 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez -- a former professional kick boxer who runs a Van Nuys gym -- has 
not returned to work since the funeral. Instead, he walks East San Fernando 
Valley streets and preaches the Gospel to any young man or woman who will 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
This crusade is the work of an anguished father, a church-going man who 
immersed himself in his religion after the death of his son, Sonny, who was a 
gang member. The change in Rodriguez has been startling and swift. Before, the 
36-year-old man fancied himself an entrepreneur, wearing expensive suits as he 
circulated through the world of boxing and promoting. Once an unfailing 
optimist, he now sees a darker side to life. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has support in his new quest. His Sepulveda church prides itself on 
converting drug addicts and gang members. He has enlisted other men in the 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are an army of God," Rodriguez said. "I've got guys who were shot at and 
stabbed, were in the penitentiary and were resurrected. We are willing to risk 
our lives, to be on the street and talk to kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these guys have more tattoos than the kids. So the kids listen." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Rodriguez held a meeting that was attended by police and 
local businessmen. The purpose of the gathering was to solicit money and 
support. Rodriguez's "army" needs a van to take youths on outings. Rodriguez 
and his cohorts have already arranged for a central California farm that will 
host young men and women for six weeks during the summer, giving them a break 
from the streets. An airplane mechanic has volunteered to teach his trade to 
street kids. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Rodriguez said he wanted to avoid speaking in the boldly 
religious terms he now uses frequently. "In this day and age, if you talk about 
God, people look at you like you have three heads. You have to be careful what 
you say." But less than 10 minutes into his speech, he was quoting Scripture. 
His voice became loud, angry. He referred, as he often does, to Ephesians. 
</P>
<P>
 Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles 
of the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might look at me as a radical or a fanatic," he told the room, "but 
this world is radical and fanatical." 
</P>
<P>
William (Blinky) Rodriguez was raised in San Fernando. He got married at 14 to 
21-year-old Lilly Urquidez, a Pacoima woman whose brother Benny was soon to 
become one of the best-known kick boxers in the history of the sport. Rodriguez 
and his wife took up kick boxing, too, and became champions, traveling the 
world with Benny. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the clan returned home to open the Jet Center gym. Rodriguez trained 
with martial arts film star Chuck Norris. He began negotiating television 
contracts for kick-boxing tournaments. He took in a young boxer named Alex 
Garcia -- a San Fernando native who served five years in prison for stabbing a 
rival gang member -- and led him to the national amateur super-heavyweight 
title and a silver medal at the 1986 World Amateur Boxing Championships. 
</P>
<P>
But Rodriguez could not steer his own children from the violence and trouble he 
had avoided so deftly in his youth. The eldest of the Rodriguezes' five 
children, David, is serving time in a state penitentiary for armed robbery and 
attempted murder. And now Sonny, who police suspect was in a gang, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe the spiritual awakening," Rodriguez said, referring to 
the change he went through after his son's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the 
breastplate of righteousness. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his recent street preaching, Rodriguez tries to coax youths to 
Thursday night meetings at his house in Sylmar. As many as 75 youths, recruited 
by Rodriguez and his army, have shown up in an evening. So far, the youths 
don't say much. They listen to Rodriguez as he tells them to stay away from the 
street crowd, the drugs and the violence. Rodriguez reads some Scripture, but 
mostly it's a counseling session. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if people outside can understand . . . to come from where we come 
from, drugs and partying, that's all we know," said Richard Sarabia, 19, who 
said he is a member of a San Fernando gang and has been attending meetings. "I 
ask myself, 'Why am I even going?' I could be partying. 
</P>
<P>
"Blinky's for real. His son got shot. We always think that all our friends are 
dying and who's next?" Sarabia said. "Blinky's trying to get us to do good 
things. He has his own wife and kids, he has everything. But he doesn't even go 
to work anymore. He goes to the park where we hang out. He's telling us things, 
doing something for us, all this time and effort and love for us and what the 
hell did we ever do for him? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anybody who cares about us and doesn't want anything in return." 
</P>
<P>
Pastor David Martinez of Victory Outreach Church, which Rodriguez attends, also 
speaks to the youths. 
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years I roamed the streets of San Fernando. I ended up as a drug 
addict," Martinez said. "I know that people in the street can change." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez is taking his message to the schools as well. He will stage a 
kick-boxing exhibition Friday at Sepulveda Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it would be good for the kids," said Dan Hensley, a physical education 
teacher at Sepulveda Junior High. "It sounds like Blinky and his wife use the 
martial arts as a hook to get the kids' attention and then give them the 
message about staying away from drugs." 
</P>
<P>
It's too soon to tell if Rodriguez's crusade will win any victories. His 
approach might seem simplistic in an era when police and government profess to 
have few answers to gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez says only that he must react to Sonny's death, and this is his 
natural reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids in the street are smoking whack and listening to the rappers. 
They're all putting up a facade. They don't want to look weak," he said. "But 
you have to remember that they're just kids. They have so many fears and 
insecurities. 
</P>
<P>
"What good do programs and agencies do for these kids? They respond to love." 
</P>
<P>
 Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to 
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who will stand in these perilous times?" Rodriguez asked. "I'm going to 
stand."

Photo, Design Class Project Is All Fluff: Industrial design students at 
Pasadena's Art Center College of Design geared up for a battle of the 
marshmallows recently as part of a visual communications class assignment. 
Students spent 14 weeks designing marshmallow-launching contraptions. The 
school's atrium was divided into 21 "planets," and the students were paired up 
in teams of two, with each team inhabiting one of the "planets." Each team was 
equipped with about 60 "space probes" (marshmallows) and had two hours to 
launch the probes from their planet to the other 20. At top, Tony Cruz loads 
his XP Super Space Modulator with a marshmallow while space partner Steve 
Caterson prepares to launch it. Meanwhile, Joe Ponce and Jim Elliott, center, 
ready their Bellows-Activated Marshmallow Launcher for action, and long-haired 
John Schrenk and Steve Eum, bottom, blast marshmallows from their Mad Max Twin 
Cam Industrial Shooter. While Deana Schoenegge checks the barrel of her 
launcher, white-faced Michael Lindars and Cheryl Johnson take a respite from 
the battle to share a laugh. IRFAN KHAN / For The Times

CHURCH ANGERED BY BUILDING DELAY; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: A MORATORIUM IS PLACED ON NEW CONSTRUCTION AROUND THE STONEWOOD 
SHOPPING CENTER. A GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH SEES A BIAS ISSUE.

<P>
The City Council has placed a 45-day moratorium on new construction around 
Stonewood Shopping Center, angering members of a group that wants to build a 
new church in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Planning officials said the moratorium is needed so the city can fashion a plan 
to ensure that new area development will be compatible with the mall. The 
moratorium was unanimously approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Downey officials view Stonewood, which is being expanded and enclosed, as key 
to revitalizing the city's main commercial district along Firestone Boulevard. 
They want to attract more new stores, restaurants and possibly a multiscreen 
cinema near the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes/Lyon Downey, a Newport Beach-based developer that owns Stonewood, has 
proposed building another shopping center on about 11 acres of land it has yet 
to buy east of Lakewood Boulevard, across Firestone Boulevard from the 
Stonewood mall. 
</P>
<P>
But officials of St. George Greek Orthodox Church hope to build a new church in 
the same area. Church officials, who hold a two-year option to buy a 2.5-acre 
parcel, said the city's proposed development and the moratorium are 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major purposes is to prevent the community from proceeding with 
this church development," said Nicholas J. Kallins, a church attorney and 
member. The parish holds services in another Downey church. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Randall R. Barb denied that the city is trying to prevent construction of 
a Greek Orthodox church. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be careful that we do a good job in planning for the future," Barb 
said. "This is a land-use issue. This is not an issue of the right to worship." 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium covers 37 acres directly to the south and west of the mall, an 
area that includes several vacant properties. City planners would like to 
develop a master plan for the area. Some recommendations for such a plan will 
be presented to the council in a public hearing at the end of the 45-day 
moratorium, City Planner Ron Yoshiki said. The council could then extend the 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the church received a two-year option to buy the 2.5-acre 
property in the moratorium area for about $2 million, church president Gus 
Georgakopoulos said. The property includes a tire shop that fronts Firestone 
Boulevard, a private school, a vacant office building and about an acre of 
vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
The church would be built on the vacant land, and the office building would be 
used as a community center. The church is paying about $4,000 a month in rent 
on the office building, which the congregation has been unable to occupy 
because it does not have a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
The church applied for a conditional permit to use the building and to move 
forward with building the new church. But the application was rejected last 
week by the Downey Planning Commission, which decided that the site in the 
primarily commercial area was not suitable for a church, Yoshiki said. An 
appeal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Hughes/Lyon have also been meeting with city officials on 
the proposed shopping center, Hughes/Lyon spokesman John C. Pentz said. 
</P>
<P>
The area is in a city redevelopment zone, but the city does not have eminent 
domain powers to force property owners to sell holdings in the zone. The City 
Council approved the redevelopment zone in 1987, but the council heeded the 
protests of local residents and businessmen and did not give its Redevelopment 
Agency condemnation powers. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has contacted some but not all of the people who own property where the 
shopping center would be built, said Pentz, who added that he has spoken with 
church officials but has not begun structured negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've heard, they have an inflated (idea) of what they think the 
property's worth," Pentz said. 
</P>
<P>
St. George officials said they would sell the property for the right price, 
about $3 million. That is $1 million more than the church will pay for the 
property if it exercises its option, Georgakopoulos said.

AVOID MAKING COSTLY MISTAKES WHEN SELLING HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and real 
estate broker.

<TEXT>
<P>
Spring is the best time of the year to sell your home. It is the most active 
season of the year for home sales. If you are thinking of selling, perhaps 
because of retirement, job transfer, birth, death, divorce, unemployment, move 
up to a bigger home, move down to a smaller home or a move to a better 
neighborhood, this is the time to take action -- when buyers come out of their 
winter hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
But please be careful. Thousands of profit dollars can be lost with one costly 
mistake. Since your home has probably been your best investment, don't throw 
your profits away. Here are some suggestions on how to get the most from your 
home sale: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Get your home into tiptop condition. Most home buyers have little or no 
imagination. Although your home may be in the best location in town, if it 
isn't in near-perfect condition, prospective buyers will either refuse to make 
a purchase offer or they will "low ball" with a very low bid. 
</P>
<P>
Painting, cleaning, landscaping, carpeting and repairing are the most 
profitable improvements to raise your home's market value and increase its 
salability. If your home needs this type of work, don't even think of selling 
until the job is completed. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred or even a few thousand dollars spent on these cosmetic 
improvements should produce at least $2 increased sales price for each $1 
spent. Incidentally, painting is by far the most profitable improvement, so 
don't hesitate to completely paint your home, inside and outside, before 
putting it up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't be confused by the home sale fix-up tax rule. In an effort to 
encourage home sellers to fix up their residences, some real estate agents 
incorrectly tell their sellers home fix-up costs are tax-deductible. This is 
not true. 
</P>
<P>
However, Internal Revenue Code 1034(b), the principal residence sale fix-up 
rule, says if you incur fix-up costs to prepare your home for sale within 90 
days before the sale date, and you pay these costs within 30 days after the 
sale closing, then you can subtract these expenses from the gross sales price. 
</P>
<P>
But this tax break results in income tax savings only if you buy a less 
expensive replacement principal residence. If you buy a more expensive 
replacement home, your profit tax is deferred anyway. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose your home sells for $150,000 and you pay a $9,000 real 
estate sales commission plus $5,000 on home sale fix-up costs for painting, 
cleaning and repairing. These fix-up costs normally have no tax significance. 
However, since you are selling your home, these $14,000 sales costs give you a 
$136,000 adjusted sales price. If you buy a less expensive replacement home 
costing $100,000, then up to $36,000 of your sale profit is taxable. Had you 
not spent the $5,000 on home sale fix-up costs, then up to $41,000 of your sale 
profit would have been taxable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Determine the market value of your home. Although your home may be in 
tiptop "red ribbon deal" condition, you aren't ready to sell it until you know 
its market value. You could hire a professional appraiser who, for a cost of 
$200 to $300, perhaps more, will evaluate your home and give you a written 
appraisal of its value based on recent comparable nearby home sales prices. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can invite three or more local real estate agents to give you their 
"listing presentations," which will include written "comparative market 
analysis" forms showing each agent's estimated market value for your home. 
</P>
<P>
But don't sign a listing agreement until you check out each agent's references 
of previous home sellers. Ask "Were you in any way unhappy with this agent and 
would you list your home for sale again with the same agent?" 
</P>
<P>
Also ask each agent for the name of their E &amp; O (errors and omissions) 
insurance company. If the agent doesn't have E &amp; O coverage, perhaps you 
should list your home with another agent who carries this important insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Decide if you really need a real estate agent. According to a survey by the 
National Assn. of Realtors, more than 80% of home sellers use a real estate 
agent. However, of those sellers who sell without an agent, only 25% said they 
would again sell without an agent. 
</P>
<P>
Do-it-yourself sellers usually discover they earn every penny they think they 
are saving on the sales commission. Advertising the home, holding weekend open 
houses, answering phone calls from unqualified buyers, helping arrange buyer 
financing and getting the sale closed are not easy tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Another do-it-yourself difficulty is negotiating with buyers who expect to 
share in any sales commission saving. Finally, a do-it-yourself seller has only 
one home for sale to compete with the hundreds of homes available to buyers 
whose agents use the local multiple listing service. The result is most "for 
sale by owner" sellers are not successful and eventually list their home with a 
professional realty agent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Protect yourself when selling your home. Today's homes are expensive, and 
buyers expect near-perfect residences. If a serious defect appears soon after 
purchase, buyers don't hesitate to sue the seller and the realty agent. To 
avoid this problem, sellers should disclose in writing all known defects of the 
residence. If the seller fails to disclose these defects, the buyer can either 
rescind the sale or recover monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of the best time of year to sell your home, get it into top 
condition, price it correctly, hire the best real estate agent and be sure to 
fully disclose any known defects in the home. These are the techniques 
successful home sellers use to maximize their profit and minimize their home 
sale problems.

HOT PROPERTY: 'THE BOSS' BUYS ON THE WESTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock star BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN has paid nearly $14 million for a secluded estate 
in what is one of the largest private-home transactions ever completed on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boss," who is expecting a baby with his former backup singer Patti 
Scialfa, closed escrow a few days ago on the property, which a real estate 
source not involved in the deal described as being "like Montecito but only 
three minutes to downtown Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
"So the working-class hero is now living in the Beverly Hills area," he 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen's gated, 4 1/2-acre estate doesn't have a swimming pool or a tennis 
court, but it has a number of mature redwood trees and some 200-foot tall 
eucalyptus trees as well as two houses: a 10,000-square-foot Mediterranean and 
a 7,500-square-foot English-style house with a two-story living room. 
</P>
<P>
The larger house was built in the '20s and has four bedrooms, two maid's rooms 
and a chauffeur's quarters. The smaller house, which also has four bedrooms, 
was built after the property was subdivided in the '70s and was sold first to a 
Beverly Hills doctor and then to actor ROBERT VAUGHN, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The parcels were reassembled into one estate by the current seller, an art 
collector and developer of apartments and shopping centers who is relocating to 
the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen also owns an estate in New Jersey, which once belonged to the late 
screen star GLORIA SWANSON, and a small house in the Hollywood Hills. He plans 
to maintain both of those homes and to do some redecorating at his new 
residence, although it is in move-in condition, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the realtors who worked on the deal would comment, but they are Don 
Caverhill and Linda May, who shared the $15.9-million listing, and Joe Coons 
and Scott Sandler of Prudential/Rodeo Realty, who represented Springsteen. 
Title is held in the name of a trust. 
</P>
<P>
Rain Pryor, actor/comedian RICHARD PRYOR'S daughter who co-stars in the ABC-TV 
sitcom "Head of the Class," is buying her first house in an area known as 
"Toluca Lake adjacent." 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old actress has been living in an apartment in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
She expects to close escrow in another week on a two-bedroom home with a large 
yard, for her Rottweiler, at $385,000 through Betty Griffin in one of Mike 
Glickman Realty's Sherman Oaks offices. 
</P>
<P>
Essam Khashoggi, brother of Saudi arms dealer ADNAN KHASHOGGI, has put 178 
acres that he owns in Kauai on the market at $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
Essam Khashoggi had planned to build a 20,000-square-foot house in the Kauai 
valley but apparently changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He just finished building a house about 25,000 square feet on the lake at 
Tahoe, and he plans to build a house the same size on 30 acres he will still 
own here at (a development known as) Seacliff Plantation," said Pat Harrington, 
who has the $11-million listing at Harrington's Paradise Properties in Hanalei, 
Kauai. Essam Khashoggi also has an oceanfront home at Hope Ranch in Santa 
Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
"He just thought he had more land (in Kauai) than he needed," Harrington added. 
</P>
<P>
The 178 acres, which have ocean frontage as well as a stream and waterfalls, 
will be sold as one parcel or as two sites: one for $600,000, the other for 
$10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi bought the 178 acres in 1987, shortly after he sold his 
20,000-square-foot Kahala home, on Oahu, for $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN BADHAM, who directed the action comedy "Bird on a Wire" starring MEL 
GIBSON and GOLDIE HAWN that is expected to open in May, has purchased a gated 
farmhouse off Coldwater Canyon for about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Badham, who directed "Saturday Night Fever and "War Games," was represented by 
Doug Taylor of Prudential California Realty, Beverly Hills, and Rebecca Riskin 
of Pitts &amp; Bachmann Realty, Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joel Weisman, chairman of the board of the American Foundation for AIDS 
Research (AmFAR) -- which gained prominence in 1988 when ELIZABETH TAYLOR was 
national chairwoman, is building two oceanfront homes at Hollywood Beach in the 
Channel Islands marina area of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman, a physician and researcher, is founding director of the AIDS unit at 
Sherman Oaks Community Hospital besides heading AmFAR, one of the largest 
private organizations in the country funding AIDS research projects. 
</P>
<P>
One of the houses that Weisman is building is for his use on weekends away from 
his main residence in the Beverly Hills Post Office area. The other house is on 
the market with Hadley Hendrick at Ennis &amp; Ennis Realtors at Hollywood 
Beach. Each of the homes under construction is valued at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood entrepreneur A. JERROLD (JERRY) PERENCHIO, who co-produced "Driving 
Miss Daisy" with Lili and Richard Zanuck, is rehabbing his Bel-Air home, next 
to former President Reagan's, at an estimated cost of more than $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Perenchio's home, known for years as the Kirkeby Estate, was used regularly at 
the opening of the 1960s CBS sitcom "The Beverly Hillbillies." 
</P>
<P>
He bought the residence for $13.6 million in 1986, and later bought three 
adjacent properties for a total of slightly more than $9 million, making his 
11.5-acre estate the largest in Bel-Air, real estate sources said. Perenchio 
also owns several homes at Malibu Colony. 
</P>
<P>
At least 26 building permits have been issued for Perenchio's Bel-Air property 
since 1988, including half a dozen so far this year, and passers-by remarked 
last week on the enormity of the work going on there, though it is obscured by 
a large, greenish, translucent sheet of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Building permits don't indicate that Perenchio plans to add much square footage 
to his Bel-Air mansion, but they show planned interior modifications to the 
10-bedroom, two-bath house, including a remodeled kitchen, and the demolition 
of several free-standing structures -- among them a garage, tennis court and 
guard station. 
</P>
<P>
Perenchio already has razed at least one of the adjacent houses he purchased, 
and is living in a neighboring one designed by Wallace Neff, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Permits also indicate that he plans to build a guard house, pool, pool house, 
tennis court, electrical vault, mechanical room and an underground motor court 
with a wine cellar with gardens on top.

HOME OWNERSHIP: THE IRS HAS SOME STRICT PROVISIONS WHEN TWO PARTIES BUY A HOUSE 
TOGETHER. IGNORING THEM CAN LEAD TO LOSS OF TAX DEDUCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With home prices skyrocketing and lenders requiring increasingly large down 
payments, you might be thinking about buying a home with someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you have some extra money that you can use to help your children buy a 
home or maybe you're the one who needs help with the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
But whether you'll be teaming up with a relative or stranger, there are some 
technicalities involved in these so-called equity-sharing arrangements that you 
must address when you're writing up a contract with your co-buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most important is structuring the deal to satisfy the Internal 
Revenue Service. If you don't have a written agreement that addresses several 
issues, the IRS can reduce or even deny your deductions for mortgage-interest 
payments and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"I think equity-sharing is the wave of the future," said Jim Sims of 
Equi-Share, a Santa Barbara-based company that specializes in putting 
equity-sharing deals together. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's important to realize that you've got to understand the tax codes if 
you want to maximize your benefits. If your deal doesn't meet IRS requirements, 
you won't get all the tax breaks that you deserve." 
</P>
<P>
More than 10% of all resale transactions in California last year -- more than 
50,000 sales -- involved unrelated buyers, according to the California Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters at the trade group say that figure will grow through the end of the 
decade, thanks to rising home prices and lower marriage rates. 
</P>
<P>
The typical equity-sharing arrangement involves two parties. 
</P>
<P>
First, there's an owner/investor who'll put up some or all of the down payment 
but live somewhere else. And second, there's an owner/occupant who will live in 
the home and be responsible for most or all of the monthly mortgage payments to 
the lender that finances the deal. 
</P>
<P>
For example, say two people want to buy a $150,000 house. The owner/investor 
could put up a 20% down payment of $30,000 and the two would get a $120,000 
bank loan to finance the rest of the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly principal and interest payments on the 10 1/2%, 30-year fixed-rate loan 
would be about $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical arrangement, the owner/occupant would write a check to the bank 
each month for $550, representing half the $1,100 mortgage payment. The 
owner/investor would write a check for the other half. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the owner/occupant would also write another check for $550, 
payable to the owner/investor. This check would reflect rent for the half of 
the home that the investor owns. 
</P>
<P>
In this type of setup, each party could be eligible to take 50% of the annual 
tax deductions for mortgage-interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
The owner/investor might also be able to take depreciation deductions on his 
half of the home because a portion of it would be considered rental property. 
However, he would also have to declare the check he receives from the 
owner/occupant each month as rental income. 
</P>
<P>
To appease the IRS and qualify for these deductions, however, both parties will 
have to make sure they include several items in their equity-sharing contract. 
</P>
<P>
First, there must be a written "shared-equity finance agreement." A verbal 
agreement won't do. 
</P>
<P>
Next, realtor Sims said, each party to the contract must have an ownership 
interest in the property that will last for at least 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean that the two of you will have to keep the property 50 years," 
said Robert Giannangeli, a spokesman for the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
"You can dissolve the contract or sell the home whenever you and your partner 
agree. It's just that the term of the contract has to be for 50 years or more 
in order for both of you to take the deductions." 
</P>
<P>
Third, one of the parties must use the home as his primary residence. 
</P>
<P>
One of the trickier IRS requirements is that the person who lives in the home 
pays the owner/investor "fair-market rent" for the portion of the home that the 
investor owns. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't meet the fair-market rent test, we can reduce or disallow some of 
your deductions," Giannangeli. 
</P>
<P>
Sims said local realtors can usually give you an estimate of the home's 
fair-market rent. You can also get an idea by checking "For Lease" 
advertisements in the classified section of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's a good idea to clip out these rental advertisements and keep them 
on file. If the IRS eventually questions whether you really charged fair-market 
rent for the property, you'll be able to submit the ads as evidence that the 
proper amount was indeed charged. 
</P>
<P>
Since equity sharing involves such important tax and legal issues, you'll want 
to consult both a tax expert and knowledgeable real estate attorney before you 
enter any type of equity-sharing arrangement. IRS Code 280A specifically 
addresses shared-equity arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Sims has also written a book on equity-sharing that includes a sample 
agreement. Titled "Share &amp; Grow Rich," it can be ordered for $21.30 
(including tax and postage) from Altaverde Publishing, 1125 Arbolado Road, 
Santa Barbara, Calif. 93103.

HOME IS NO ESCAPE FROM INDOOR AIR POLLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
CONTAMINANTS: WHETHER IT'S RADON, ASBESTOS OR LEAD PAINT, HOMES DON'T ALWAYS 
HAVE CLEAN AIR. FORTUNATELY, IN MOST CASES, CLEAN UP IS EASY.

<P>
In our increasingly polluted cities, we can at least escape the miasma of dust 
and chemicals in the sanctuary of our homes. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. We may close the door on some outdoor pollutants, but can walk into the 
realm of indoor contaminants that can, in sufficient concentrations, pose a 
serious health threat. 
</P>
<P>
Take radon: a colorless, odorless gas that occurs naturally and is found 
everywhere at very low levels, it nevertheless can become a problem when it 
gets trapped inside buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It is known to cause lung cancer, and is blamed for between 5,000 and 20,000 
such cases a year, or about 10% of the U.S. total, says the Environonmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos, what used to be a common insulator and fireproofer, is now recognized 
as a cause of lung cancer and asbestosis. Much asbestos-related disease comes 
from work environments, but the material is also present in many homes, 
especially in older buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Another common home pollutant is lead, most commonly found in paint, and 
released into the atmosphere by burning or sanding. 
</P>
<P>
There are more, but before you sell your home and take up residence in a 
sensory-deprivation chamber, know there are ways to detect these pollutants and 
reduce or eradicate them. 
</P>
<P>
Tracking down indoor pollutants may begin with an unexplained health complaint. 
Short-term problems traceable to an indoor source may include dizziness, 
headaches, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, or simply fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Such complaints may be cured simply by eliminating exposure to the source or 
improving ventilation. Others, however, may only show up years after long or 
repeated exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA estimates that we spend about 90% of our time indoors, and those who 
spend the most time inside are those who are most susceptible to indoor 
pollutants -- children, the elderly, the chronically ill and those suffering 
from respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
Devices are available to measure pollutants. Radon, for example, can be 
measured with charcoal canisters or alpha track detectors. State environmental 
agencies usually can provide information on how to obtain them. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you are buying a home or just want to test your existing home, here's 
what to look for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Radon: Most commonly, it comes from the breakdown of uranium in the soil 
and rock on which houses are built. Test for it, but get professional advice 
before trying to get rid of the source; seal cracks and other openings in the 
basement floor; treat radon-contaminated well water by aerating or filtering 
through granulated activated charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA says the average radon level in American homes is 1 1/2 picocuries per 
liter, but some homes have been found with up to 200 picocuries. Most levels in 
most homes can be reduced to 4 picocuries, the EPA says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Asbestos: Usually found in deteriorating or damaged insulation, 
fireproofing, or acoustical materials. Homeowners should get professional 
advice on removal and not disturb materials suspected of containing asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lead: The level of lead dust is likely to be 10 to 100 times greater in 
homes where sanding or open-flame burning of lead-based paints has occurred. 
The EPA recommends that homeowners test paint for lead if they suspect its 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
Cover lead-based paint with wallpaper or other building materials. Replace 
moldings and other woodwork or have them removed and chemically treated off 
site. Drinking water may also be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Formaldehyde: Found in pressed-wood products and some types of foam 
insulation. Also in durable-press drapes, other textiles, glues and tobacco 
smoke. The levels in the home can be reduced by using "exterior grade" 
pressed-wood products containing phenol resins, maintaining moderate 
temperature and humidity levels, and increasing ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carbon monoxide: Common sources are unvented kerosene and gas heaters, 
leaking chimneys and furnaces, down-drafting from wood stoves and fireplaces 
and gas stoves. It can also leak from adjoining garages. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce levels by keeping gas appliances properly adjusted, using vented gas 
space heaters and furnaces, installing exhaust fans vented outdoors above gas 
stoves, hiring professional help to clean, inspect, and tune up a central 
heating system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Organic gases: Found in household products including paints, paint 
strippers, solvents, wood preservatives, cleansers, moth repellents and 
dry-cleaned clothing. The highest levels are most likely to be found after 
paint stripping. Proper ventilation is the best way to reduce their levels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Biologicals: Including pollen and fungi; these can be produced by wet or 
moist walls, ceilings and carpets; poorly maintained humidifiers and air 
conditioners. Adequate ventilation and proper maintenance of air conditioners 
and humidifiers will guard against them. 
</P>
<P>
An EPA publication "The Inside Story -- A Guide to Indoor Air Quality" says the 
levels of pollution from individual sources may not pose a significant health 
risk in themselves, but together, could be a threat to residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, however, there are steps that most households can take both to 
reduce the risk from existing sources and to prevent new problems from 
occurring," the agency says.

AD AGENCY EXECUTIVE BARBARA J. STEWART DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara J. Stewart, a leading figure in Orange County-based real estate 
advertising, died April 21 at her Newport Beach home after a long illness. She 
was 48. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was president of B. J. Stewart Advertising &amp; Public Relations from 
its founding in 1976 to early 1989, when it merged with Hubbert Advertising 
&amp; Public Relations Co. to become Hubbert-Stewart Advertising &amp; Public 
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
The wife of Orange County real estate sales executive Terry O'Neil, Stewart 
became one of the few women to head an American Assn. of Advertising Agencies 
(AAA) accredited firm. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, B. J. Stewart Advertising employed a full-time staff of 49 and 
billed for more than $11 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart often described the agency-client relationship as personal and 
creative. "It's more like a partnership in the sense of two bodies acting 
together toward common goals," she once said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chicago, Stewart moved to California to study at the Pasadena 
Playhouse, later attending UCLA, where she majored in marketing and business. 
</P>
<P>
She was active in the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California, the Sales 
&amp; Marketing Council and the Home Builders Council, as well as the Orange 
County Industrial League. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart received the Outstanding Contribution to Education award from the 
Orange County Department of Education, chaired the first annual American Lung 
Assn. Celebrity Waiters' Luncheon in 1986 and was a member of the board of 
directors of the Search Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Besides her husband, Stewart is survived by her son, Marc Stewart, stepdaughter 
Shana O'Neil Hill and stepson Mike O'Neil.

CURE FOR TOXIC INDOOR AIR: BRING IN HOUSEPLANTS; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: NASA RESEARCH FINDS THAT PLANTS CAN PURIFY THE AIR IN SEALED HOMES 
AND OFFICES WHERE HARMFUL SUBSTANCES ARE RECIRCULATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS, Sims is a copy editor at Los Angeles Times Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Humans started bringing plants indoors in the middle of the last century, when 
Victorian English gentry stuffed their parlors with ferns, palms and 
aspidistras. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, we've appreciated a plant's gifts of beauty, serenity and the sense 
of worth and purpose that comes with the responsibility for keeping something 
alive -- even a sulky philodendron. 
</P>
<P>
But now, thanks to National Aeronautics and Space Administration research, we 
can appreciate indoor plants for much more than aesthetics and duty: They keep 
us healthy by purifying our air. 
</P>
<P>
And not just stale, tobacco-clouded air. Since the energy crisis of the '70s, 
in order to reduce heating and air-conditioning bills, buildings have been 
constructed with more insulation, unopening windows and recirculating air 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with building materials that have proved downright toxic, have 
given us the "sick building syndrome"; gases emitted by such homes and offices 
can cause sore throats, stuffy noses, skin rashes, headaches and other 
miseries. Add radon to all that, and our homes and offices could be killing us. 
</P>
<P>
This problem was of particular interest to NASA, because it applies to many 
closed environments, including space stations. Experiments by B. C. Wolverton 
at the John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi show that common house 
plants -- pothos, spider plant, English ivy, Dracaena marginata -- remove 
deadly benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene and carbon monoxide from the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon monoxide comes from auto emissions, or at least most of it, but the 
other three are also with us just about everywhere: benzene is a common solvent 
in gasoline, ink, plastics and rubber, and it's also present in some 
detergents, drugs and dyes. 
</P>
<P>
Benzene can cause blood and bone-marrow diseases and many less drastic 
ailments, such as tension, headaches and sleepiness. 
</P>
<P>
Formaldehyde is no longer confined to biology lab jars; foam insulation, paper 
products (from grocery bags to tissues), particle board, permanent-press 
fabrics, adhesives, cigarette smoke and kerosene all contain formaldehyde. Most 
mobile homes are chock-full of it because of the materials used in 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Formaldehyde can cause asthma, throat cancer and skin, eye and nose irritation. 
</P>
<P>
Trichloroethylene is big in dry cleaning, paints, varnishes and adhesives. It 
also causes liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The amazing thing is that plants don't keel over after wheezing this stuff into 
their systems; they somehow absorb the poisons through their roots and 
transform them into clean oxygen, which is released into the air for us to 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wolverton's research, any plant will help, even a fleshy succulent 
like aloe vera, but those plants that absorbed the most unhealthy air (in a 
sealed room with one plant in a 6-inch pot of soil) were Gerbera daisy (Gerbera 
jamesonii), popular with the florist trade and not commonly considered a house 
plant; English ivy (Hedera helix), mother-in-law's tongue (Sansevieria 
laurentii), pothos (Epipremnum aureus) and spider plant (Chlorophytum elatum). 
</P>
<P>
 Dracaenas and palms did well, even a banana plant. Different plants were 
tested with different chemicals, and some absorbed one poison more readily than 
another; the main point is that they all absorbed something. 
</P>
<P>
An important point: In Wolverton's research, the soil is almost as important as 
the plants in the purification process; the experiments indicate that the soil 
should be open to the air, not shrouded by greenery (and not covered with bark 
or pebbles). 
</P>
<P>
Wolverton also conducted studies of plants and soil combined with a carbon 
filter and recirculating fan; this was an even better purification system, but 
until this setup is easily (and inexpensively) duplicated for home and office 
use, a plant in potting soil will do a good job. 
</P>
<P>
While NASA's report is suitably scientific, the results are simple enough: 
Living and working with indoor plants will keep humans healthier than living 
and working without them. 
</P>
<P>
And for people who toil in one of those hermetically sealed new buildings, 
plants should be a part of the operating budget, like pencils and fax machines. 
Wolverton says that eight to 15 plants will "significantly improve" the air 
quality in an average home; that's about one plant per 100 square feet.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
SKYLIGHTS CAN SAVE ON LIGHTING, HEATING 
</P>

 QUESTION: I would like to install a skylight in my family room, but I'm 
concerned that it will waste energy and increase my utility bills. Are there 
any energy-efficient skylights and how should I select one? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There are some new very energy-efficient skylights available. With 
proper selection and installation, one can actually lower your utility bills. 
Installing one is a very simple do-it-yourself weekend job. 
</P>
<P>
Skylights can save energy by reducing the need for electric lights and by solar 
heat gain in the fall, winter and spring. A typical skylight provides several 
times more light than a window of the same size. The light also diffuses better 
throughout your room. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the new super-high-efficiency window glass technology is available in 
skylights too. Double-pane, low-emissivity-coated (low-E) argon-filled glass 
and Heat Mirror glass are the most efficient, with insulating R-values of R-4 
or greater. The sun's fading ultraviolet rays are also reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Dome-shaped triple- and double-pane plastic glazing is also efficient and often 
less expensive. Although the dome shape can slightly distort the light and 
view, it tends to self-clean when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
For plastic glazing, acrylic maintains its clarity best. Polycarbonate plastic 
is almost as crystal-clear as acrylic and is virtually unbreakable. 
</P>
<P>
For solar heat gain from a south- or west-facing skylight, clear high- 
efficiency glass is best. A location above a dark ceramic tile floor or a brick 
wall is excellent to absorb the solar heat. However, during the summer, you 
should provide some type of shading to reduce overheating. 
</P>
<P>
For general room lighting only, a bronze or smoke tinted skylight is best. It 
still provides plenty of light during the day and it reduces the heat buildup 
in the summer. Clear is best for north-facing locations. 
</P>
<P>
At night during the winter, using an insulated cover reduces the heat loss. I 
use a 2-inch-thick piece of rigid foam insulation under my low-E argon- filled 
skylight. Cut it slightly smaller than the opening and put foam 
weatherstripping around the outside edge. The weatherstripping seals and holds 
up the lightweight insulating foam cover in the skylight opening. 
</P>
<P>
The skylight frame and curb (the raised section it sets on) should be made of 
an insulating material -- vinyl, fiberglass, polycarbonate -- or have a thermal 
break if it is aluminum. Some very-high-efficiency ones use rigid insulating 
foam in the frame itself. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 351 showing a buyer's guide of 
super-high-efficiency-skylight manufacturers, types of glazing and frame 
materials offered, and do-it-yourself installation instructions. Please include 
$1 and a self-addressed business-sized envelope. Send your requests to James 
Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.

NOTHING BORING ABOUT VERSATILE ELECTRIC DRILL; 
</P>
<P>
POWER TOOLS: ATTACHMENTS ENABLE DRILL TO BE USED TO SAND, SHARPEN, MIX PAINT, 
CUT METAL AND TURN SCREWS.

<P>
Every homeowner and apartment dweller should have an electric drill in his 
toolbox. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you opt for the extra power and range of uses of a corded electric 
drill or the convenience of a rechargeable battery-powered cordless model, you 
will find that the electric drill is dozens of tools in one because attachments 
make it so versatile. 
</P>
<P>
Power drills come in a variety of chuck sizes (the chuck holds drill bits and 
other attachments) and turning speed ranges (revolutions per minute or rpm). In 
general, the smaller the chuck the higher the rpm and the lower the turning 
power, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
The most practical electric drill for basic home improvements is one that has a 
three-eighth-inch chuck with a variable and reversing speed range. This means 
that the rpm increases as the trigger is pulled harder, and that there is a 
switch that allows the drill to turn in the opposite direction. Corded drills 
have an "on" lock feature on the switch. 
</P>
<P>
Prices start at about $40 for a good-quality corded drill and about $70 for a 
rechargeable battery-powered cordless model. When instructions are followed 
carefully and goggles are worn, either type of drill is safe to use, even by 
the novice. 
</P>
<P>
Look for electric drills at most large hardware stores, home centers or tool 
supply stores. Either domestically made or imported models are acceptable, but 
avoid any brand that is noticeably less expensive than average. 
</P>
<P>
What can an electric drill do? 
</P>
<P>
Aside from drilling holes in about any material one finds around the house, 
including wood, metal, glass, plastic, concrete, brick and ceramic tile, the 
electric drill performs lots of other jobs. Here are some of the more common 
examples: 
</P>
<P>
Screwdriver. Once you have experienced the ease and speed of driving screws 
with an electric drill, and especially a cordless model, it is hard to go back 
to turning them with an ordinary screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
Most hardware stores sell an attachment called a "magnetic bit holder" which, 
when used with a variable-speed and reversing drill, allows you to turn most 
any type and size of screw you will find. 
</P>
<P>
The built-in magnet holds the screws at any angle until they are driven into 
the work. Phillips-type screws work exceptionally well with this drill 
attachment. 
</P>
<P>
Sander. With the use of an attachment called a "sandpaper disk holder," or an 
attachment called a "drum sander," your electric drill becomes a very good 
electric sander. Large sanding jobs are better suited to a corded drill. Use 
the "on" lock. 
</P>
<P>
The sandpaper disc holder can be used for rough sanding or paint removal, while 
the drum sander is ideally suited for smoothing edges and for curved surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Polisher. Most sandpaper disk holders can be fitted with a bonnet for waxing 
and polishing. Excellent with car wax. 
</P>
<P>
Wire brush. For removal of rust and paint from metal, wood and concrete 
surfaces, there is a wire brush drill attachment that does the job quick and 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
Grinder. When goggles are worn, any electric drill can become a reasonable 
grinder with the proper attachment. Use a grinding wheel to sharpen drill bits, 
chisels knives and other tools. Hold the drill to your workbench with a special 
clamp called a "drill stand" (available at most tool or hardware stores). Use 
the "on" lock feature of a corded drill. 
</P>
<P>
A grinding disk attachment can be used to quickly remove paint from wood and 
metal surfaces. This attachment looks like the sandpaper disk holder but is 
metal and has sharp perforations. 
</P>
<P>
For smoothing "tight" spots on irregularly shaped objects or for removing sharp 
edges on most metals, use a "grinding stone." Grinding stones come in a variety 
of shapes and sizes and are mounted on a shank to fit any drill. 
</P>
<P>
Paint mixer. This attachment allows easy thinning and mixing of any type of 
paint without removing it from the can. It is a long rod with one or two 
four-point blades on the end. The drill turns the rod and the blades mix the 
paint just as a blender mixes food. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to put the blades into the paint before turning on the drill, and turn 
the drill off before removing. Either a corded or cordless drill is fine for 
paint mixing. 
</P>
<P>
Hole saw. An attachment called a "hole saw" allows you to make holes in wood 
larger than is normal with standard drill bits. Hole saws are generally sold in 
sizes from three-quarter-inch to 4 1/2 inches and can bore through wood up to 
about 2 inches thick. Adjustable "hole cutters" are a single unit that adjusts 
to cut holes from about 1 inch to 2 1/2 inches in diameter in wood up to about 
three-quarter-inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Circle cutter. Circle cutters are also adjustable and allow holes to be cut up 
to 12 inches in diameter. Both hole saws and circle cutters work better with 
corded electric drills. 
</P>
<P>
Metal cutter. With yet another attachment called a "carbide impregnated metal 
cutoff disk" a corded electric drill can be used to cut steel, aluminum or 
copper. Use a drill stand to anchor the drill to a work bench. Wear goggles and 
stand to one side. 
</P>
<P>
Auger. An excellent way to drill holes in the earth for bulb planting or 
fertilizing shade trees and shrubs is with a large drill bit called an "auger." 
This device allows you to easily drill down 12-18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Kite string winder. My personal favorite drill attachment is a make-it-yourself 
kite string winder for a cordless drill. Take a piece of 2-x-2-inch, 1-x-2-inch 
lumber or round dowel 1 inch or 2 inches in diameter and cut an 8-inch section. 
</P>
<P>
At either end of the 8-inch piece, drive in a 2-inch nail so that three-quarter 
inch of the nail sticks out. Cut off the head of the nail with a wire cutter or 
hack saw. Now insert the three-quarter-inch "stem" into the drill chuck and 
tighten. 
</P>
<P>
Presto! An instant kite string winder that beats anything you can buy. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you rarely work around the house, an electric drill is a must-have 
tool. It is the type of possession that, once owned, you wonder how you got 
along without. 
</P>
<P>
VERSATILE ELECTRIC DRILL 
</P>
<P>
Geared chuck: Holds drills and other attachments to be turned by the drill. 
</P>
<P>
Nameplate: Lists amperage and voltage, often rpm, but rarely horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
Housing: Should be of insulating material if drill is not the grounding type. 
</P>
<P>
Switch: Should have smooth action, some means of locking in the "on" position. 
Should also be variable speed and reversible. 
</P>
<P>
Cord: Check on length. Better drills have longer cords. Chuck key holder should 
be attached to the cord. Cordless models have battery pack in the handle. 
</P>
<P>
Paint mixing attachment mixes paint in the can. 
</P>
<P>
Hole saws cut holes 3/4 of an inch to 4 1/2 inch to about 2 inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
Mount drill in "drill stand" for sanding small object. 
</P>
<P>
Grinding wheel attachment is used with drill stand. For sharpening drill bits 
and tools. Wear goggles. 
</P>
<P>
Drill attachments: grinding stones, hole saw, adjustable hole saw, for Phillips 
screws, for slotted screws.

WORKS OF WOMEN ARCHITECTS SHOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The works of four prolific women architects in the first 50 years of this 
century are on exhibit through May 11 at UCLA's Graduate School of Architecture 
and Urban Planning in Gallery 1220. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Constance Austin was an expert in building adobe houses and in 1935 
outlined her ideal socialist community in her book titled "The Next Step." 
</P>
<P>
Edith Northman received her architecture degree in Denmark and migrated to 
California in 1920; she designed individual and multi-unit residences and in 
the 1930s designed 50 gas stations for Union Oil. 
</P>
<P>
Edla Muir was just 13 years old when she apprenticed to John Byers, a craftsman 
who later became an architect. She designed more than 200 projects, mostly 
residential, and was known for her use of natural materials and careful 
integration of outdoor and indoor space. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Morgan, the best known of the four, had an engineering degree from UC 
Berkeley and was the first woman to graduate from the prestigious Ecole des 
Beaux Arts. Among her more than 700 projects, Morgan designed the Hearst Castle 
at San Simeon, the former Herald-Examiner building and five YMCAs in Los 
Angeles, as well as homes for actress Marion Davis.

CAN'T NASA DO SOMETHING RELEVANT? -- ENVIROMENTAL STUDIES, FOR INSTANCE;

SPACE: INSTEAD OF MISSIONS TO MARS, NASA SHOULD AIM TOWARD THE SUN AND VENUS 
AND LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.

Attention Vice President and National Space Council Chairman Dan Quayle: If 
you're looking for something important and innovative that the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration could actually do -- during your lifetime, 
perhaps even in this Administration -- here it is. How about a space 
environmental-study initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Recent news that U.S. Tiros-N weather satellites did not detect any 
global-warming trend from 1979 to 1988 raises a question: Why isn't science in 
space being used to answer questions that are driving everybody crazy on the 
ground? 
</P>
<P>
Environmental unknowns are a central topic of U.S political debate -- up to the 
White House, where top Bush Administration figures have been sparring over how 
serious the prospects for global warming are. Many in Congress are calling for 
major policy commitments as preemptive measures against environmental 
emergencies that may or may not be happening. International organizations are 
already issuing greenhouse-effect manifestoes. So where is NASA? 
</P>
<P>
NASA's current budget request bulges with capital for a continuously manned 
space station, an expensive -- $30 billion-$60 billion -- project whose returns 
to the public even its supporters have difficulty explaining. Millions more are 
allocated to the study of fantastically exorbitant -- perhaps $400 billion -- 
bases on the moon and expeditions to Mars, which both the President and vice 
president have rhapsodized about, because they sound incredibly nifty in 
non-binding speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Grand human ambitions such as a Mars flight will surely be realized someday. 
But today, in the Year of our Lord 0005 GR (fifth annum post-Gramm-Rudman), 
wasting breath on such notions may charitably be described as wacky. Meanwhile, 
there's comparatively little in the NASA budget for pragmatic environmental 
space missions that not only might provide information benefits for the 
taxpayers who foot NASA's bill, but also should be relatively cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting its annual money request to Congress last month, NASA rolled the 
drums for what it called a new environmental focus. This "focus" turns out to 
be repackaging projects in the pipeline for years -- lately under the name 
Mission to Planet Earth. Funds involved represent less than one-third of the 
probable cost of the initial overnight stay in NASA's beloved orbiting motel, 
the space station. Several projects, such as a pair of improved 
Earth-observation satellites, are great ideas. But amazingly, though NASA is 
hyping its environmental focus as a "crash" effort, some of the spacecraft 
involved won't go up for 15 years. NASA went from exploding rocket prototypes 
to a moon landing in far less time. 
</P>
<P>
From an environmental standpoint, NASA science missions usually point in the 
wrong direction. Most are oriented toward the outer planets and the far heavens 
-- fascinating, but with no meaningful effect on the Earth. The sun, source of 
all Earth life, has received surprisingly little investigation; the same for 
Venus, the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and, more to the point, a 
planet with a runaway greenhouse atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most influential global warming document in the Bush White House 
has been a paper, written principally by the astronomer and "Star Wars" 
advocate Robert Jastrow, arguing that by the sun's sheer power, tiny 
vacillations in solar output are more likely to be the root cause of earthly 
climate variations than human mischief such as carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Jastrow contends that although the pattern of global temperature ups and downs 
in this century does not sync with greenhouse theory -- the thermostat has 
bounced around instead of rising smoothly -- it does appear to correspond with 
what's known about fluctuations in the sun's luminosity. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists understand amazingly little about the internal processes of the 
sun: Accurate information about its energy output is notoriously scarce, 
because such data is best collected in space. Sound like a promising field of 
inquiry? Yet NASA continues to devote more funds to studying other stars than 
our own. 
</P>
<P>
This October the shuttle Discovery is scheduled to launch Ulysses, an 
international robot spacecraft that will examine the sun's polar regions, 
unobservable from Earth. Ulysses is the first probe of the sun in more than a 
decade. Next year the shuttle Columbia is scheduled to carry aloft an automated 
solar study station called Atlas, which will be brought back down and taken up 
throughout the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
These are sound ideas, but fall short. NASA should be designing a major series 
of probes and satellites to ring the sun on a continuing basis -- not during 
brief shuttle trips as with Atlas. Such an initiative might not only help 
answer some of the pressing ecological questions: It could provide an early 
warning system for any changes in the fusion generator that sustains earthly 
existence. What if the sun cooled? We'd need to know that. 
</P>
<P>
Next consider Venus, whose size and composition are Earth-like, but whose 
900-degree surface temperatures are believed to result from a runaway 
greenhouse effect. NASA has a billion-dollar orbital research station in 
transit to Venus, for compiling radar maps of the topography of this 
carbon-clouded world. Such diagrams are likely to be interesting to astronomy 
graduate students and worthless from a practical standpoint. Yet the United 
States has no plans to fire probes into the Venusian atmosphere to find out 
what went wrong there -- knowledge that might bear directly on the terrestrial 
greenhouse debate. 
</P>
<P>
NASA, of course, isn't oblivious to the potential for reorienting temporarily 
toward environmental studies of immediate benefit to Earthlings. But in recent 
years budgetary circling of wagons has become the agency's claim to fame. Since 
Challenger, NASA management has exhibited absolute bureaucratic terror about 
offending any interest group, manufacturer or congressman's district by 
altering any plan once made. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, space environmental research would be carried out by boring, 
affordable automated spacecraft rather than marvelous budget-boosting manned 
chariots. A decade of inconclusive study of Mars flight is probably worth more 
to NASA's empire than a program to produce environmental information quickly. 
</P>
<P>
At minimum, the Mission to Earth projects should take precedence over 
feasibility studies about growing hydroponic oranges on Mars. Crash efforts 
focusing on the sun and Venus should be initiated. Everyone complains that NASA 
lacks a mission relevant to the man on the street. Here's one.

THE DEVIL WHO MADE U.S. BUSINESS LEANER, MEANER; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: HOW MICHAEL MILKEN BECAME THE JUNK-BOND KING GOES BACK TO THE TIME 
WHEN AMERICAN CORPORATIONS WERE GOBBLING UP THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles R. Morris, Charles R. Morris' newest book, The Coming Global Boom, 
will be published by Bantam next month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is most disturbing, somehow, is the sheer venality of the crimes that 
Michael R. Milken, the erstwhile "junk-bond king" of Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc., has admitted to. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, after all, was not your average boiler-room penny-stock manipulator. He 
was a life force: No single person since J.P. Morgan had as great an impact in 
reshaping the American business and financial landscape. But the Michael R. 
Milken that comes slinking out of the federal charge-sheet is no world-class 
mover and shaker. 
</P>
<P>
A client wanted to cheat on his income taxes, so Milken rigged a series of sham 
trades to create some fake losses. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Wynn, the head of Golden Nugget, wanted to get out of a large stock 
position in a takeover target. So Milken arranged with Ivan Boesky to rig the 
stock price with a flurry of sham-trading activity. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel discovered that its sales agreement with an investment fund didn't cover 
all its sales expenses. So Milken overcharged the investors for trading to make 
up the difference. And so the sorry recitation goes. 
</P>
<P>
None of these offenses, Milken insisted in his guilty plea, go to the heart of 
his main junk-bond business. But of course he's quite wrong about that. Milken 
was the creator and soul of the junkbond market. For most of a decade, he and 
Drexel exercised almost unprecedented sway over the American financial markets, 
handling three-quarters, or even more, of annual junk-bond financings. 
</P>
<P>
Such pervasive amorality at the heart of the empire taints the entire 
enterprise. The entire junk-bond decade is now seen, in the words of one 
eminent financial journal, as "the biggest private financial scandal of the 
20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Reality, as always, is much more complicated. The harsh judgments now raining 
down upon Milken, Drexel and the whole era of glitz and glitter that was Wall 
Street in the 1980s are both true and deserved -- and utterly false. 
</P>
<P>
The beginnings of the story go back almost 30 years to the last Wall Street 
boom in the mid-1960s. American corporations, like the Japanese today, were 
taking over the world. American mass-production technology, most of it from 
Detroit, was generating huge cash flows that large companies were plowing into 
acquisitions at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Business-school professors flocked to the soaring corporate towers and created 
huge "planning," "marketing" and "MIS" bureaucracies. Executives leaned back 
contentedly in a sleek world of statistics, private jets and exclusive clubs. 
And John Kenneth Galbraith reported that "the problem of production has been 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
That complacent paradise came apart in less than a decade. First came the 
oil-price shocks of the 1970s, then wave after wave of assaults from leaner, 
hungrier, more aggressive competitors, mostly from Japan. American executives, 
panting and red-faced, peered in wonderment through fat-padded eyelids as their 
stock prices sank like a stone throughout the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1980s, as T. Boone Pickens delighted in pointing out, the total of stock 
prices of most major oil companies was lower than the value of the oil they 
owned. In other words, raw oil sitting in a well somewhere was worth more by 
itself than if you attached an oil company to it. That was the measure of the 
disdain shareholders had for their corporate managements. 
</P>
<P>
And that is the world that gave birth to the junk-bond market. Junk bonds were 
an instrument of rebellion, an avenue of financing outside the traditional 
channels controlled by a cozy club of the white-shoe investment banks and the 
biggest industrial companies. Milken's contribution was to see the opportunity 
before anyone else and to assemble a network of like-minded outsiders to keep 
the new channels flowing. 
</P>
<P>
Junk-bond-financed management buyouts, hostile takeovers and the mere threat of 
hostile takeovers forced a radical restructuring of most big companies through 
the first part of the 1980s. Mobil got out of its circus and department-store 
businesses. Goodyear shed its aerospace holdings and its resort hotels. All the 
big textile companies refocused on just one or two markets where they could 
gain a real competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Union Carbide shed a string of consumer businesses and got back into chemicals. 
During the 1980s, there was a sharp drop in big-company white-collar employment 
and an equally sharp rise in American manufacturing productivity. American 
steel is now cheaper than Japanese steel. 
</P>
<P>
Did Milken make this happen? No. No more than J.P. Morgan caused the 
large-scale reorganization of American industry at the turn of the century. But 
they both speeded the processes up. 
</P>
<P>
But that, it turns out, is only one side of the story. Gross excess may be an 
intrinsic feature of American capital markets. Most of the useful corporate 
restructurings had probably already happened by 1985 or 1986. And, in fact, 
probably most pre-1986 junk-bond deals have turned out to be quite profitable. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1986, Wall Street had discovered the new golden goose. Buyout fund after 
buyout fund plunged into the market, buying up lackluster companies at grossly 
inflated prices. Twenty-five year-olds made millions playing computer games 
with their Lotus spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
And at the center of it all sat Michael R. Milken, with his billion-dollar 
income and famous X-shaped desk in Beverly Hills, keeping the market rolling 
and the stakes rising with a network of nouveau-riche S&amp;L and insurance 
executives, ready to snap up any piece of paper with his name on it, no matter 
how foolishly priced, much of which is now being choked back up onto the laps 
of horrified taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
So how does one judge Milken and Wall Street? Was Milken a hero or a devil? A 
financial genius or a crass stock manipulator? Is Wall Street an engine of 
industrial restructuring or a cheap, glitzy casino? The answer to all of those 
questions, confusingly enough, is all of the above.

LATINOS WANT TO BE WON BUT INSIST ON COMMITMENT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: WITH REAPPORTIONMENT NEAR, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS MUST REALIZE 
THAT LATINOS WANT POWER, NOT JUST ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Antonia Hernandez, Antonia Hernandez is president and general counsel of the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), a national Latino 
civil-rights organization based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latino voters are being wooed as they've never been wooed before, and the 
suitors are the strangest of would-be bedfellows. Both Democratic and 
Republican Party leaders are sending messages loud and clear to the Latino 
community that the political future could be bright, indeed, if Latinos would 
only join forces with the party that serves their interests. Not surprisingly, 
both sides insist they -- not the other guys -- represent the party for 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we've heard this before. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. It's not that all this attention isn't flattering, because 
it is. For the first time, the Latino population is considered large and 
powerful enough by outsiders to be consulted when determining future political 
agendas. That's a refreshing change from the days when Latinos talked to each 
other, but had to shout to get anyone else's attention. But the overtures are 
also aggravating because we are now considered important enough to be -- 
there's no other word for it -- used by both parties. So while these budding 
relationships may be intriguing, may we remind all the political "big boys" 
that Latinos will be beholden to neither party. 
</P>
<P>
That's because we also recognize the significance of the changes looming on the 
political horizon. Indeed, Latinos around the country are already gearing up 
because they know some of the toughest skirmishes of future elections will be 
fought long before any candidate hits the campaign trail. The most contentious 
contests will occur during the reapportionment process, when state legislatures 
draw new district boundaries in 1991 on the basis of the population statistics 
gathered from the recent census. 
</P>
<P>
Already behind-the-scenes discussions and rumblings from both parties indicate 
how high the political stakes of reapportionment are going to be. On a recent 
visit to Washington, for example, I was approached by a high-ranking Republican 
attorney who asked how the GOP could help MALDEF in the 1991 reapportionment 
process. To appreciate the irony -- maybe even the hypocrisy -- of that query, 
remember that Republicans control the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
MALDEF and other civil-rights groups have sued them to try to force them into 
reapportioning districts to give Latino candidates a chance to be elected. I 
told this acquaintance that what the GOP can do for Latinos on reapportionment 
is to call off his fellow Republicans -- now, not in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he was no naive messenger. GOP strategists know exactly what they're 
doing in approaching Latinos, and African-Americans, with offers of cooperation 
in 1991. Some political analysts believe that cities with large minority 
populations, and which have traditionally supported white Democrats, could be 
reapportioned in such a way that minority groups will elect their own 
representatives. But to do that, many white voters in neighborhoods nearby 
would have to be shifted into suburban districts, where Republicans do well. 
That could force white Democrats to compete with Republicans on their turf. 
Republicans think this bodes well for them, and obviously most Democratic 
incumbents would prefer to keep districts well-stocked with "safe" Democratic 
voters, be they white or minority. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos know all this, which is why we are not waiting for the Democrats or 
Republicans to decide how the major parties can best "serve" the Latino 
community. Instead, we resolved early on that the only way to ensure that the 
interests and concerns of the Latino community are addressed seriously and 
decisively is to do the political groundwork ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Latino groups are joining forces to maximize their political 
clout. MALDEF, the National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO) and 
the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project (SVREP) are combining 
efforts to stretch our limited resources to the fullest, and we are investing 
in computer technology and data systems to support our work. 
</P>
<P>
It is a formidable effort and one that necessitates the cooperation, compromise 
and tenacity of all those involved. But I'm confident that the Latino community 
will be successful in this pivotal endeavor. While Latinos make up only 8% of 
the total population in this country, our numbers are steadily increasing and, 
in the meantime, our concentration in key states like California, Texas, 
Illinois and New York will guarantee that our presence is felt even during the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans must realize that the time of using Latinos to 
perpetuate their own political self-interests is over. We are cognizant that 
the political process is one of accommodation, and so we will allow ourselves 
to be "used" as long as we also are accommodated. We enter into this 
"negotiation" with our eyes open and with a clear understanding of the role we 
can and should play in the political future of this country. We are on the same 
playing field with access to the same data as everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
This year and beyond, Latinos will examine what both parties have to offer, and 
will cash in their political chips where they get the best return: fair and 
effective political representation. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Party leaders will continue trying to meet with minority leaders to 
discuss our "common interests." Democrats will continue to assure Latinos that 
they remain the party of the working class. 
</P>
<P>
For now, to be bluntly honest about it, the GOP has more to prove. Republican 
leaders in Orange County, after all, hired uniformed guards to intimidate 
Latino voters in 1988; in South Texas, Spanish-language radio ads sponsored by 
the Republican Party were used in the same election to discourage Latinos from 
voting; and we are not about to forget how the party has protected the 
incumbency of its three Republican supervisors at the expense of the Latino 
community in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the last general election, both President Bush and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis 
tried to persuade the Latino voter that they spoke the same language. But they 
only paid lip-service (in Spanish, I might add) to the real issues facing 
Latinos. Both parties must realize that "speaking the language" just doesn't 
cut it anymore; we expect substance and commitment from those who claim to 
represent us or who seek to involve us in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
Reapportionment and voting rights will be a major thrust for organizations like 
MALDEF in the 1990s and will determine whether we finally crack the threshold 
or if we continue to fight for the crumbs. I, for one, am tired of fighting for 
the crumbs. It's too early to say which party will win this turf war, but rest 
assured that Latinos are determined also to come out on top in this latest 
battle for political empowerment.

OF SEWERS AND SURF: FEAR AND LOATHING ON THE MALIBU CAMPAIGN TRAIL; 
</P>
<P>
CITYHOOD: BEFORE THE SUPERVISORS WILL LET THE 'GLAMOUR CAPITAL' GO, THEY WANT 
TO IMPOSE THEIR SANITIZED VISION ON IT. THE RESULT IS RAW POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Philip Dunne, Writer-director Philip Dunne has lived in Malibu for 45 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once more the deceptively laid-back community of Malibu is aflame with 
political fury. Billed as a fight over cityhood, the issue is actually sewers, 
a subject that has long dominated conversation at Malibu dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, many residents hope to incorporate as a city, free of what they call 
the tyranny of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the supervisors, wielding both legislative and executive powers, are 
closer to being absolute monarchs than any other elected officials in our 
democracy. As the late Supervisor John Anson Ford told me in 1937, when I was 
trying to persuade him to run for mayor: "Each of the five supervisors enjoys 
twice the clout of any mayor -- and one-fifth of the headaches." 
</P>
<P>
Today's supervisors, with Ed Edelman dissenting, want to impose a comprehensive 
and enormously expensive sewer system on Malibu before they will let it go. 
Without sewers -- the need for them is still a subject for debate -- there can 
be little further development, and developers are primary sources of the funds 
with which supervisors win elections. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, in particular Deane Dana, in whose district Malibu lies, 
picture themselves as enlightened tribunes whose dreams of progress and 
sanitation are thwarted by the selfish millionaires of Malibu, lolling on their 
exclusive beaches. To the proponents of cityhood, it is a case of the sturdy 
yeomanry of Mailbu protecting their idyllic way of life from the rapacious 
barons of development and their ruthless seneschals, the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the supervisors have reluctantly yielded to a court order and 
scheduled a cityhood election for June 5, with the proviso that incorporation 
be delayed until March 28, 1991, when construction of the sewers could be under 
way. Although the original sewer plan has been greatly reduced by the 
California Coastal Commission, assessments for homeowners have been raised. So 
the battle will continue, with much figurative blood still to flow. 
</P>
<P>
But then, politics in what Malibuites like to think is the glamour capital of 
the world have been tinged with ferocity ever since the redoubtable May K. 
Rindge's armed horsemen patrolled the borders of what was then her private 
estate to fend off railroads, highway and other intrusive tentacles of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Malibuites have survived many threats to their cherished way of 
life: In the 1950s, it was plans for a nuclear reactor in Corral Canyon; in the 
1960s, projected freeways from Santa Monica and the valley, interchanging near 
Malibu Canyon; in the 1970s, a grandiose plan by the county engineers to create 
a flat coastal plain by filling in all the coastal canyons ("You'll love it," a 
county official told us, "it'll be just like Miami Beach"). 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the warfare was internal. Malibu, with its many movie people, was a 
major battleground during the witch-hunts and blacklists following World War 
II. Like the current war over cityhood, this was not a class struggle. There 
were affluent members of the Communist Party here, and, living in hillside 
shacks, what could be described as right-wing hippies, who packed guns and 
hoarded food against an imminent takeover by the "commie hordes." 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, when I was helping organize a protest against the House Un-American 
Activities Committee, I was severely handicapped by not having a telephone, 
there being a postwar shortage of such amenities. I borrowed the phone of an 
opulent colleague and rang up several-hundred-dollars' worth of calls to 
congressmen, journalists and New York theater people, enlisting their support 
and detailing our plans for a protest flight of stars to Washington. I was 
surprised by the distress my action evoked in my colleague, even as I handed 
over a check for the full amount. Years later, I learned that I had broadcast 
our plans over the telephone, probably tapped, of a stalwart member of the 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Far less opulent was a handyman my wife and I employed, an equally stalwart 
member of the John Birch Society. He always asked for payment in cash, and when 
he died he left not only a large collection of guns, but bundles of cash 
concealed in lavatory cisterns, pillows and even garbage cans. I'm not saying 
that all was extremism in Malibu politics. My neighbor Kyle Palmer, then 
political editor of The Times and widely believed to be the de facto Republican 
boss of California, joined with me in launching charity drives in the community 
-- and I had, quite erroneously, been identified by national political 
columnist Drew Pearson as Kyle's Democratic counterpart. So here and there 
political sweetness and light prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
But not much of it is in evidence today. As for the June election, my hunch is 
that cityhood will win, despite the combined political muscles of developers, 
land speculators and Pepperdine University, whose plans for massive expansion 
depend on the supervisors' regional sewers. I base my guess not on the 
unpopularity of the sewer system itself and its huge assessments but the 
problem presented by Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
PCH, as we Malibuites call it, is possibly the worst thoroughfare in all 
America. It is at once a principal route north, the commuter road not only for 
thousands of Malibuites but for commuters from inland developments who want to 
avoid Ventura Freeway gridlock. It is used by local shoppers and Los Angeles 
beach-goers, by tourists, by hundreds of bicyclists, by California Highway 
Patrol cars and ambulances screaming toward the all-too-frequent accidents, and 
by joggers and casual strollers in swimsuits, often accompanied by dogs, on and 
off the leash. If the traffic can move at all, to observe the 45 m.p.h. speed 
limit is to be tailgated, rear-ended, shouted at and even shot at. 
</P>
<P>
There is absolutely no way that PCH can accommodate a huge buildup of traffic, 
and that will be on the minds of many voters. Even the developers must wonder 
how they can hope to sell choice properties if the buyers can't get in or out. 
</P>
<P>
But this is Malibu, where anything can happen. In 1962, Richard M. Nixon ran 
for governor of California, and looked like a shoo-in until the extreme right 
challenged him in the Republican primary with Joe Shell, a former USC football 
player. Malibu was ablaze with Shell bumper stickers and billboards, with Shell 
posters on every power pole. There were Shell meetings, barbecues and parades. 
Malibu Republicans, in effect, were so Shell-shocked that they seemed quite 
ready to jettison their quondam national standard-bearer. One day my wife was 
driving our children home from school when our 10-year-old spotted a car with a 
Nixon sticker. "Look, Mommie!" she cried -- "Liberals!" 
</P>
<P>
I have often wondered if Nixon lost the final election to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
Sr. because enough rightists with 10-year-old mentalities mistook him for a 
liberal. In Malibu, it is unwise to bet the ranch on anything.

FROM COLLAPSE TO RESURRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Pope John Paul II visited Czechoslovakia last week, he came bearing not 
only blessings but the vision of a new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As his spokesman, Dr. Joaquin Navarro-Valls, explained, "Europe is unique 
because it is a continent with a shared Christian heritage. Since 1981, the 
Holy Father has been talking about a common European home from the Urals to the 
Atlantic. Now (the collapse of communism) makes it possible to put his idea 
into practice." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the Pope announced that within the year he will call an 
unprecedented synod of all Europe's bishops. One vital topic they will take up 
is John Paul's worry that, having rid themselves of communism, Eastern Europe's 
new democracies will replace it with the kind of "secularism, indifference, 
hedonistic consumerism, practical materialism and formal atheism" he believes 
disfigures Western society. 
</P>
<P>
The people of the East did not throw off totalitarianism simply to stand in 
Christian rather than Marxist bread lines. However, as communism's most 
unyielding adversary, the church enjoys unprecedented moral authority 
throughout most of Eastern Europe. How it chooses to wield it is a question of 
the greatest moment. Between the World Wars, for example, the politics of most 
of the region's countries were vexed by so-called people's parties. Their 
programs -- unforeseen mutations of the Catholic Action movement -- were 
nationalist, populist and, invariably, anti-Semitic. Their remnants have begun 
to stir again, particularly in Hungary and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the church has an alternative model at hand in the highly 
successful Christian Democratic parties of Western Europe. These parties -- 
founded in 1919 by Luigi Sturzo, an Italian priest and, later, fervent 
anti-fascist -- are a successful synthesis of democratic politics and Catholic 
social thought. 
</P>
<P>
Their emphasis on the reciprocal rights and obligations of all social classes, 
on the intrinsic evils of unjustified governmental centralization and their 
acceptance of pluralism seem particularly suited to Eastern Europe's current 
problems.

CRANSTON'S DEFENSE IN S&amp;L CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I serve as attorney to Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) in connection with the 
current Ethics Committee proceedings. I have thus far not commented publicly 
upon that proceeding, a policy also followed by counsel for the other senators 
and by counsel to the committee. The article (Part A, April 13) concerning this 
matter is so vicious and so inaccurate, however, that I am compelled to request 
that you print this letter. 
</P>
<P>
The article bears the headline "Cranston's S&amp;L Defense Weakened." This 
headline suggests that something newsworthy has occurred in the Ethics 
Committee matter, and the text purports to inform the public that Cranston's 
case has had a "major setback" because "investigators" have rejected a "key 
argument." According to the article, questions posed to a witness by committee 
investigators indicated that they do not accept as significant the fact that 
both former chairmen of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board have testified that 
nothing the senator did or said affected their decision not to take over 
Lincoln Savings. The article describes this testimony as a "central part" of 
Cranston's defense and implies that its rejection by investigators signals a 
turn for the worse in his case. The speculation of this witness (who insisted 
upon anonymity) as to the state of mind of his examiners is thus elevated into 
an authoritative comment on the committee's likely decision. That is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, Cranston's defense has been and will continue to be the 
truth. He did nothing improper or unethical. Whether regulators felt they were 
pressured is relevant, but hardly the "central part" of the defense. Second, 
the notion that a witness can conclude from the questions being asked how the 
questioner views the merits of a case is silly. Third, it is the members of the 
committee, and not the investigators, who will decide the legal and factual 
issues before them. 
</P>
<P>
If your witness is someone who has an interest in rehabilitating his own 
reputation at the expense of Cranston (such persons do play a role in these 
events), it is scandalous. You are treating Cranston unfairly in a most 
fundamental way, that is by elevating the speculation of a witness whose 
credibility is undetermined into something close to Gospel, and making no 
effort to inform your readers of fundamental, undisputed facts. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Cranston deserves an apology and your readers deserve to know the truth.

PEACE DIVIDEND

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress is making a big issue of the "peace dividend." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is a parallel between Shakespeare ("Merchant of Venice") whose 
character, Portia said: "Take ye your pound of flesh but take ye not one drop 
of blood" and congressmen who say: "Cut billions from the defense budget but 
cut not one dollar from my district." Until we can overcome this provincialism, 
there will not be a meaningful peace dividend.

ANTI-SMOKING ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think it's great to see the start of the state's ad campaign against the 
advertising practices of the tobacco industry ("State to Launch Anti-Smoking Ad 
Campaign," Part A, April 10). This is a rare case of tax dollars well spent. 
</P>
<P>
But aren't our tax dollars also paying substantial subsidies to the the tobacco 
growers? Why don't we just pay tobacco farmers not to grow tobacco in the first 
place and save ourselves lots of money all around? 
</P>
<P>
In these times of record budget deficits, declining government services and a 
crumbling infrastructure, someone has to be more responsible with our money. 
It's time we taxpayers speak up and let our legislators know it's time to start 
thinking about the little guy.

Consider the strange story of international trade. When the government 
announces our trade enemies next week, one country will be conspicuously absent 
from the list: Japan. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a trade war, we made a kind of pre-emptive peace treaty. Among the 
items in the treaty, the Japanese agreed -- as a concession to us! -- that they 
would shorten their work week. They would reduce the hours for government 
employees and encourage the private sector to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
What this suggests is that working hard is somehow an unfair labor practice. 
According to a University of Michigan study, Japanese men work about eight 
hours more a week than Americans. We don't have to catch up; they have to slow 
down. 
</P>
<P>
This is the sort of reasoning that says Americans don't really have to start 
saving money: The Japanese have to start spending it. Next year, we may demand 
that their children study less. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that the Japanese need pressures to make them work fewer hours, to 
force them into leisure, fits neatly into our stereotype of their society: 
hard-working and workaholic, unified and closed, disciplined and rigid. 
</P>
<P>
But it discounts the reality that countries, like families, may go through 
generational changes. One generation picks itself up by its bootstraps, the 
next generation makes it, the next wonders what "it" is all about. 
</P>
<P>
It is a familiar progression for one family to go from the shopkeeper to 
professional to artist. People go through these stages in one life as well, 
from the search for safety and security to what psychiatrists call 
"self-actualization." Having wondered about their next meal, then their next 
year, they eventually pause to wonder about the meaning of their life. 
</P>
<P>
It's what the mid-life crisis is all about. It's behind the cliche of executive 
life: "Nobody ever died wishing they'd spent more time at the office." 
</P>
<P>
Japan may also be at the cusp of this change. Many Japanese are asking what 
rewards they should have from their international success story. They also are 
worrying about their own "younger generation," not sure they need to work so 
hard and afraid that they might not. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that certain questions are universal. In every culture, human beings 
ask: "Is this all?"

When Dan Rather reports on the banned-in-Cincinnati exhibit of Robert 
Mapplethorpe's photographs, he does not show the homoerotic, pedophilic or 
sadomasochistic pictures, the ones that brought the police and the courts, the 
ACLU and Jesse Helms, the censors and libertarians into the game. Television 
will show you the exquisite flower pictures and the tamer portraits. It tells 
you about the nasty ones. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, this newspaper does not publish, say, Mapplethorpe's self-portrait 
in leather with bullwhip inserted in his rectum. This quite obviously is 
censorship. Why is the ACLU not protesting? 
</P>
<P>
Because everyone, ACLU included, favors censorship in principle. No one 
protests the banning of Mapplethorpe's nastier pictures from television and 
newspapers because there is a general consensus that some things are not to be 
shown on the mass media. But as the media become less mass -- as you go, for 
example, from network to cable to videocassette -- more and more is permitted, 
until we reach the point where just about anything is permitted for viewing in 
the privacy of one's own bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
This arrangement, which might be called censorship by classification, enjoys 
wide support because it is a reasonable way for a pluralistic society to deal 
with the question of obscenity and public standards. The question with 
Mapplethorpe is how to classify his art. Should it be classified as so 
outrageous and degrading as to be reserved for the most private sanctum (the 
home)? Or is it serious enough to deserve placement in a public institution 
such as an art gallery? 
</P>
<P>
Note that even the museum curators who exhibit Mapplethorpe are careful to 
place the most offensive pictures in special rooms under special cover. Even 
they accept the principle of segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Why? For two reasons. First, not to segregate is to risk assaulting the 
unwitting. To show, say on the "CBS Evening News," a picture of one man 
urinating into the mouth of another (also in the Mapplethorpe exhibit) would be 
to assault the sensibilities of millions who did not seek it out. That violates 
the classic liberal dictum that you can do what you want to yourself so long as 
you do not harm others. 
</P>
<P>
The other reason is that even if people aren't harming others, society has an 
interest in what people do to themselves. , Libertarians don't like this kind 
of pater nalism, but most people in this democracy believe that society has the 
right to prevent consenting adults from, say, drug-taking or self-mutilation 
(selling a kidney for money, for example). In short, society has the right -- 
the duty, even -- to protect people against themselves. 
</P>
<P>
We know that drugs can injure. But can art? "What reason is there to think that 
anyone was ever corrupted by a book?" asks Irving Kristol. "This last question, 
oddly enough, is asked by the very same people who seem convinced that 
advertisements in magazines or displays of violence on television do indeed 
have the power to corrupt." because words and images have the power to degrade 
that society tries to restrict certain kinds of material to the smallest 
possible audience. That is why strip joints and porno houses are segregated 
into combat zones. Some things may not be displayed on billboards. Some may not 
be shown on TV. Some may not be shown in public galleries. 
</P>
<P>
What goes where? That is the issue. It is one not of principle but of 
classification. Take away all the posturing, and the issue with Mapplethorpe is 
not, as the civil libertarians pretend, "Are you for or against censorship?" 
The issue is "Where on the spectrum do you place Mapplethorpe?" 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, where do I? Having seen the catalogue, though not the 
exhibit, I find his work too melancholy to be offensive, too decadent to be 
pornographic. Given current cultural norms, even his rougher stuff is, in my 
view, correctly placed in a public art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Cincinnati may, however, have a different standard. If they 
believe that Mapplethorpe's rougher stuff ranks a rung lower, why should they 
not be permitted to decide that it is too degrading to warrant public exhibit? 
That is no more an attack on the First Amendment than keeping these pictures 
off television. 
</P>
<P>
The sophisticates howl at this judgment. They sneer at the yahoos of Ohio for 
their small, censoring minds. Well, if the sophisticates and the civil 
libertarians are so outraged by censorship, are they prepared to defend my 
project to have the bullwhip-in-rectum study blown up and featured on a Times 
Square billboard?

ATHLETIC-FOOTWEAR DESIGN IS MORE ART THAN SCIENCE, BUT THE GUESSES ARE BECOMING 
MORE EDUCATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Automation magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time -- when life was simple -- exercise was pretty generic, and so 
were your athletic shoes. To unwind, you shot a few hoops by the garage, tossed 
a softball over at the school or strolled down to your local mailbox. You 
probably wore a pair of $12 sneakers and never gave them a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
Came the fitness boom and suddenly you learned that your old footwear just 
couldn't keep up. Maybe you started running 30 miles a week, practiced an hour 
of aerobics every few nights or joined a basketball or softball league. 
Walking, running, tennis, basketball and aerobics each involve different types 
of movements with their own distinctive patterns of stresses and strains. And 
so, because your work-outs got serious, you had to get a serious shoe. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, a little consumer knowledge proved rather dangerous. Your need 
for the "right" shoe caused the shoe industry to make lots of models, not only 
differentiated by sport but often by the kind or level of activity you were 
doing in that sport. Runners had a choice of models made for sprints or 
ultramarathons, trails or road running, while aerobics fanciers could pick 
between models for high- and low-impact regimens, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, walking shoes and basketball sneakers are in, says Thomas B. Doyle, 
research and information director for the National Sporting Goods Assn. In 
1988, while the overall market for sports shoes rose only 7% to nearly $3.8 
billion, sales of walking shoes jumped 47%, and high-tech basketball shoe sales 
grew by 34%. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the sports medicine, biomechanics and shoe-manufacturing 
communities are divided on a number of fronts. In large part, the controversies 
are due to an overall lack of knowledge on exercise biomechanics and its 
relationship to sports injury. Shoe design remains more art than science, 
although the guesses are becoming more educated. 
</P>
<P>
One source of disagreement is the current back-to-basics movement, which is 
fostering the return of the generic athletic shoe (one that bears little 
resemblance -- in look or price tag -- to those $12 sneakers of the past). Part 
of this movement arises from the growing realization that specializing in a 
single sport isn't necessarily healthful, much less fun. "We've been looking at 
the fitness boom for years," says Tom Clarke, Nike marketing vice president, 
"and we've observed that people are becoming much more inclined to do a 
different number of activities to be fit." 
</P>
<P>
However, this trend is also a reflection of the growing confusion over just how 
injury results from exercise. Here again, a little too much knowledge -- in 
this case, on the part of researchers -- has been dangerous. Sure, laboratory 
techniques have improved markedly and there is a growing body of data that is 
getting more sophisticated all the time. But are the data reliable? How can you 
truly gauge the impact of jumping, for instance, if no two jumps are alike? On 
the other hand, does the very act of gathering data -- for instance, 
instrumenting a subject or asking him to land on a special device that records 
the force -- affect the way a person jumps? 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the answer for consumers seems to be: When in doubt, wear what's 
most comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the cross-training shoe. "We were the first company to say that people 
who are concentrating in any particular sport need to buy a specialized shoe," 
says Nike's Clarke, himself a biomechanics Ph.D. But about two years ago Nike 
changed gears and premiered the cross trainer, a shoe for everyman, and 
subsequently turned the market upside down. 
</P>
<P>
The cross trainer is especially targeted toward health club members who enjoy a 
variety of forms of exercise. "The typical cross-trainer (user) is a person who 
plays some racquetball, runs two or three times a week, maybe takes an aerobics 
class or lifts weights," Clarke says. Yet, he adds, such diverse activity is 
forcing people to make compromises that could be painful. "You have to be 
realistic and understand that these people generally don't buy different shoes 
for each sport," he says. "Chances are, they own tennis shoes, which is 
reasonable for racquetball but not for running." 
</P>
<P>
The cross trainer combines the cushioning of running shoes with the firm foot 
support of basketball shoes. According to Clarke, the breakthrough that made 
the cross trainer possible was the "foot-frame," an extension of the midsole up 
the sidewalls (or upper) of the shoe -- in effect, providing some of the 
support of basketball shoes but without their weight or stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
Cross trainers are the most controversial development in the athletic shoe 
field. They are at best a half-baked compromise, according to La Jolla 
podiatrist Dr. Joseph Ellis, who happens to consult for Asics-Tiger, one of 
Nike's competitors. "The cross trainer is like a leisure suit," he says, "which 
is neither for leisure nor a suit." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the impetus for high-tech athletic shoes came from running, which 
kicked off the fitness boom in the 1970s. Running remains the best-understood 
sport, and not only because of its early popularity and longer history of 
research. Running has also proven the easiest sport to measure in the lab 
because it is simple and repetitive. The runner moves in only one direction, 
plants his heel, rolls onto midfoot, then propels off at the toes, repeating 
the cycle about 500 times each mile. 
</P>
<P>
Poor shock absorption remains the bane of runners. At each heel strike, the 
foot hits the ground with a force equal to three times the person's weight. 
Without adequate cushioning, runners may suffer shin splints, a severe 
stretching of lower leg muscle; plantar fascia, an inflammation of ligaments 
fanning out from heel to forefoot, and heel spurs. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, the foot naturally braces to reduce the shock of heel strike. 
Rather than hit ground squarely, it bends and rotates a bit. For most people, 
especially those with flatter feet, the foot tends to roll inward during ground 
contact, a process called pronation. A certain amount of pronation is fine, but 
too much of a good thing causes "runners knee," a sharp pain caused by the 
twisting and tearing of tendons surrounding the kneecap. This occurs as the 
knees try vainly to twist in sympathy with the pronating foot. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, running shoes need to cushion, yet control excess foot movement, 
which is a bit of a paradox since too much cushioning can accentuate pronation. 
For that reason, cushioning is generally limited to about an inch of material 
under the heel and is used in conjunction with a rigid cup, called a heel 
counter, that confines the heel tissue (which itself provides natural 
cushioning) during impact. 
</P>
<P>
Cushioning is the area with the greatest variations between brands: For 
instance, Nike's air sole features encapsulated gas, while Tiger's gel sole 
encapsulates a viscous fluid. Brooks, in turn, has designed the "Hydroflow" 
system using two chambers of fluid that actually flow in response to the degree 
of impact upon heel strike. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the features that control pronation are found in the sole. For 
instance, a wedge of material is generally cut lengthwise down the center axis 
of the sole to, in effect, cause the foot to "fall" towards center while it is 
on the ground. Firmer material is used along the inner edge of the sole in the 
midfoot to further reduce the degree of inward roll. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of cushioning is resilience, also known as "energy return." 
Although you need cushioning in the sole, too much of it can make the shoe feel 
like a dead weight -- the last thing you want to experience when you're 
finishing that 10K race in the park. Energy return is the key theme behind 
Reebok's latest physics of motion advertising campaign. It's put there not only 
to make you run faster but to help prevent injury as well, says Reebok 
marketing chief Mark Goldston. "Energy return helps keep the foot stable. If 
you come down with severe impact on the heel and there's no source of energy 
return, you could wobble or shimmy." To get that extra bounce, Reebok places 
tubes made from Hytrel, a material developed out of the space program. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is still out on just how much resilience is really needed. "I'm not 
sure you really want energy return," says Tiger's Ellis, who claims that too 
much of a good thing could destroy the foot. 
</P>
<P>
Denver sports podiatrist Dr. Edward Raczka agrees. "We still don't know about 
the secondary arthritic changes that could occur over time." Nike's Clarke 
supports the concept, but believes that much of the current advertising is 
deceptive. "Some new interpretations will make you believe that you will come 
down on the sole like a trampoline. That's still pretty hard to achieve with a 
material that's only an inch thick with people of 150-200 pounds crashing down 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Many runners whose legs couldn't take the stress have turned to walking. 
Sensing an emerging market -- one composed of aging, affluent yuppies -- the 
shoe companies have responded in force with yet another new kind of shoe. The 
question still rages whether we really need specialized shoes for a rather 
generic, low-stress activity. "We have walking shoes because the consumer 
wanted them -- because it's hard to say that you have a legitimate category if 
you don't have any equipment," says Athletes Foot shoe testing center director 
Tom Brunnich, who also covers the industry for Runners World. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walking shoe is a fashion look," claims Ellis. "A lightweight running 
shoe is adequate for walking. Even a tennis shoe might be adequate." Not 
according to Alex Hofsteter, marketing director for Rockport, which practically 
invented the walking shoe 15 years ago. According to him, when you walk, your 
heel may hit the ground with only half the force of running, but it is hitting 
the ground at a more acute angle. Furthermore, he adds, your feet are on the 
ground longer, meaning you have more of a chance to pronate. That's almost a 
nonproblem, counters Converse biomechanics research director Rick Bunch, since 
the foot is hitting the ground with far less force. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Hofsteter adds, running shoes are simply too squishy for walking. 
At heel strike, they feel like a soft pillow, then they immediately collapse. 
Therefore, compared to running shoes, Rockports are designed with heavier heel 
cups, firmer cushioning, and higher arch support for the midfoot during the 
gait, thereby limiting pronation. 
</P>
<P>
Although walking may be the kindest and gentlest sport to the foot, the court 
sports, especially basketball, are certainly among the cruelest. "You can 
understand why basketball players have to be the greatest athletes in the 
world," Brunnich says. "They have to jump, be able to move side to side like a 
tennis player, then turn around and run up and down the court like they're 
doing an 800-meter dash." 
</P>
<P>
The sheer variety of movements makes the court sports very difficult to 
measure, according to University of Oregon biomechanics professor Dr. Barry 
Bates. For instance, no two jumps are alike; the combination of forces that 
result when someone jumps, turns, changes direction, plants the feet or simply 
lands atop the toes of an opposing player is considerable. To get just a vague 
idea of the ground impact forces involved, Bates' lab is dropping people from 
premeasured heights, a test he concedes does not account for the added stresses 
due to propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, those stresses produce ankle sprains, knee twists, shin splints, 
fatigue fractures and, of course, toe fractures from collisions under the 
backboard. Forget about lightweight performance shoes. Although many basketball 
shoes carry the sleek Michael Jordan look, they are brute-force gear, heavily 
armored from heel to toe. "If they could put a ski boot on a basketball player, 
they'd do it," says Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
For tennis players, the stresses might be more in the head than in the elbow. 
Still, like their basketball counterparts, tennis players are prone to ankle 
sprains and knee twists. Compared to their basketball brethren, tennis players 
run more from side-to-side, stop and start more suddenly, and plant their feet 
more often. However, they jump less and almost never collide with anyone. 
Therefore, to keep the foot stable during lateral movement, the upper portions 
of the shoe are thicker than running models but not as fully armored as those 
for basketball. For stops and starts, the shoe requires a harder sole with 
strong traction and forefoot flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
If the state of knowledge about tennis and basketball is primitive, it is 
practically nonexistent for aerobics. Credit that partly to the newness of the 
activity but mostly to, again, the great variety of movements. Jumping alone is 
hard enough to measure, but add to that the endless variation of disco dancing, 
hops and steps from side to side, and you can understand why aerobics are a 
scholar's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Although the individual movements in aerobics might not match those of court 
sports, they are far more frequent, and if you are an instructor who teaches 
several classes, watch out. According to Penn State University biomechanics 
researcher Todd Miller, you are three times as likely as your students to get 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Denver sports podiatrist Raczka recommends a shoe with a fairly low heel and a 
firm upper to keep the foot from wobbling at ground impact and, of course, lots 
of cushioning. Because aerobics dancers tend to jump off their toes, the 
forefoot of the shoe must be flexible; yet the rest of the upper must be firm 
to protect the foot during lateral movements. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to selling aerobics shoes, according to Tiger's Ellis, 
perhaps the top priority is that they look good. "I was giving a talk at a 
trade show about a year ago and a woman asked me why we didn't design a 
high-tech aerobics shoe," he says. "We'd stand at our exhibit booth and display 
one (a high-tech model) that looked ugly, and all we'd hear is, 'I'd never wear 
that.' " Ellis claims that the shoe companies can't take aerobics seriously, an 
argument that Reebok's Goldston -- whose company made its name in aerobics -- 
disagrees with. "High performance and high image don't have to be separate," he 
says. "Look at Porsche 928; just because they make it beautiful doesn't mean it 
can't go 160 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
The question of technology vs. fashion has dogged the sports shoe industry 
since the fitness boom first made sneakers big business. The boom, and the 
technology, started with running shoes in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"Running had a growth like nobody had ever seen before, or possibly since," 
Ellis says. 
</P>
<P>
The running consumer, Brunnich adds, to this day has remained the hardest to 
satisfy. "If you can't sell your technology to runners, you can't sell it to 
anybody," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke believes that the typical runner is older, has been involved in the 
sport longer and therefore expects more out of a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly doesn't hurt that other shoe types, notably basketball and 
aerobics, took the burden of the fashion market off running. But Clarke notes 
that the tables are beginning to turn a bit, and manufacturers are beginning to 
pay more attention to the construction of basketball shoes. For instance, Nike 
and others are introducing inflatable uppers in basketball to correct the 
notoriously poor fit of basketball shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The key of research, according to Brooks biomechanics research director Ray 
Frederickson, continues to be the midsole, the part of the shoe that cushions 
the foot. Within the next five years, Frederickson predicts, the foams that 
currently are used in the making of midsoles will be replaced by new, stronger, 
more durable, yet more resilient thermoplastics, carbon fibers, resins and 
composites. 
</P>
<P>
The shoes may get better, but the selection won't get any less confusing or any 
less critical. But the final test will remain, as always, whether the shoe 
fits, says podiatrist Raczka. "The bottom line is, wear whatever is comfortable 
for you, because you don't always need all the armor."

When it comes to expressing individual style, lapel pins offer a rare 
opportunity to stand out from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Like bumper stickers, they say something about the owner. Unlike rings or 
bracelets, they don't get in the way of office machines. Lapel pins by artists, 
for women and men, are becoming as collectible as paintings. It's a way to have 
your art and wear it too. BARBARA THORNBURG

Regarding Carol Chastang's Mar. 3 letter concerning Barbara Harrison's "Pure 
Gore" (Jan. 28), I wish to say that Miss Chastang's choice of the adjective 
pretentious for someone with a good vocabulary is unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Although this advertises her own intellectual inadequacy, the perception is not 
uncommon. There actually exists in our country a great number of individuals 
who communicate daily in the English language, in their private lines, in 
business, etc., and who resist -- moreover resent -- learning new words, 
calling them "obscure." A pity! As Alexander Pope put it, "The fool is happy 
that he knows no more."

EXTRAORDINARY FEAT FOR 'JUST AN ORDINARY STUDENT'; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: KNOWING GEOGRAPHY CLINCHED THE CALIFORNIA CITIZEN BEE FOR THE SAN 
GABRIEL HIGH JUNIOR. BUT NOT BEFORE HE SHOWED A KNOWLEDGE OF ECONOMICS AND 
HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Everett W. Chun, a 16-year-old aspiring physicist and philosopher from San 
Gabriel, won the second annual California Citizen Bee competition on Saturday 
after surviving 18 grueling rounds of questions about geography, current 
events, economics, government and history. 
</P>
<P>
The shy, bespectacled San Gabriel High School junior clinched the title after 
correctly identifying Georgia and South Carolina as the states separated by the 
Savannah River. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier rounds, he was asked to define "matching funds," name the reporters 
who uncovered the Watergate scandal and determine whether a foreign policy 
speech by President John F. Kennedy supported containment, isolationism or 
detente. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just an ordinary student," said Chun, whose stern face gave way to a wide 
smile after his last challenger was tripped up by a question about Keynesian 
economics. "However, I believe in the importance of making a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Witham, a San Gabriel social studies teacher who coached Chun, said the 
youth is anything but ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be taking a course in laser physics this summer at USC," Witham 
boasted. "He has an unusual love of learning. You don't see that much." 
</P>
<P>
Chun was one of 22 teen-agers -- many with sweaty palms, chewed fingernails and 
nervously tapping heels -- from high schools throughout Southern California who 
competed in the state final in downtown Los Angeles. One by one, stumped 
students peeled off the stage, gradually narrowing the field to 11, then 10, 6, 
3 and 1. In all, judges asked 328 questions over three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It is OK to applaud now," moderator Huell Howser told a murmuring crowd of 
parents and teachers as the questions grew tougher. "You can also applaud me 
after I read the questions." 
</P>
<P>
The competitors Saturday were winners in local and regional contests over the 
last few weeks that involved 900 students from about 100 high schools. The 
Times sponsored the contest in California, one of 40 states participating in a 
nationwide academic program developed by the Close Up Foundation, a 
Washington-based educational group. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's top three winners were awarded cash prizes of $3,000, $2,000 and 
$1,000 respectively and now advance to the national competition in Washington 
in June. Last year, Ken Kuniyuki of Torrance took third place in the national 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Chun will be joined in Washington by second-place winner Ivo Labar, a San Pedro 
High School senior, and third-place winner Aarti Verma, a Walnut High School 
senior. Labar, 17, wants to be a "sea-going captain." Verma, also 17, wants to 
be a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
The students were given a 229-page book of questions to prepare for the state 
competition, and teachers received 24 pages of answers. Close Up President 
Stephen A. Janger warned the three winners Saturday to keep studying. 
</P>
<P>
"I would re-read everything you have done about 250,000 times before the 
national competition," Janger said.

HEALTH: COUNTY'S PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY TEAM RESPONDS TO CALLS ABOUT CRISES 
INVOLVING THE MENTALLY ILL. OFFERING ON-THE-SPOT COUNSELING IS SOMETIMES 
DANGEROUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mental patient had been terrorizing his Carson neighborhood with a lead 
pipe -- smashing cars, banging on the sidewalk. A call went out to Richard 
Russell, a member of the Los Angeles County Psychiatric Emergency Team. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Russell arrived, the troubled man had retreated indoors. Russell 
stepped into the house along with a sheriff's deputy and the patient's worried 
mother. The man saw them, raised an ax and charged. "Insane anger," the veteran 
psychiatric worker recalled. "I grabbed the mother and threw her out of the way 
. . . (and) ran the other way." 
</P>
<P>
The scene ended in a whirl of violence -- the deputy firing his gun, the 
patient going down in a spray of blood. He was whisked to an emergency room for 
surgery and later transferred to a psychiatric hospital. Russell, meanwhile, 
went on to the next case -- another memory filed away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary," he said of the incident a few years ago. "It seemed like time 
stood still when that gun cracked." 
</P>
<P>
The chilling moment was unusual -- but not without parallel -- in the lives of 
those who work the PET team, as the specialized psychiatric emergency unit is 
called. The squad consists of about 20 specialists ranging from psychiatrists 
and social workers to nurses and psychiatric technicians. 
</P>
<P>
They fan out on the streets of Los Angeles each day, defusing mental health 
crises that flare up in neighborhoods, schools and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Like troops in an outmanned infantry, PET workers struggle to patrol a region 
of 10 million inhabitants. They operate from seven far-flung Los Angeles County 
mental health clinics, racking up thousands of miles a year as they crisscross 
the territory responding to calls from police or concerned citizens. 
</P>
<P>
They face guns, knives and job burnout. They are expected to bring cool 
rationality to situations where rationality has all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling in pairs for safety, the unarmed team members offer on-the-spot 
counseling in the streets. Where possible, they arrange appointments for 
patients at mental health clinics. Where necessary, they are empowered to use 
physical force to confine a patient who is considered dangerous to himself or 
to others, or who is so impaired he cannot care for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Under orders of the team, such patients can be held at a psychiatric hospital 
for up to 72 hours of evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles PET network, initiated in 1970, was considered a model for 
similar programs now operating in other large urban areas, including Orange 
County. Last year, the Los Angeles team handled 26,017 calls and made 6,200 
trips into the streets, according to figures compiled by the county Mental 
Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, because of reductions in personnel and working hours, these 
numbers are expected to fall by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
PET members say their task has been made tougher in the last two years by cuts 
in state funding for local mental-health programs. Today, the team is half the 
size it was a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like losing half your police department," said Dr. John S. Wells, the 
county's assistant medical director for mental health. "We're not dead, but it 
has wounded the system." 
</P>
<P>
The reductions have made it nearly impossible to respond to marginal calls or 
to follow up on cases, Wells said. Instead, PET workers "put out fires," as one 
veteran member described it. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those fires burn on Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles, where mental 
illness is rampant, according to team members. In a 1982 study, the county 
estimated that 30% to 50% of Skid Row's escalating homeless population was 
severely mentally ill. Team members say the afflicted can be found today on 
nearly any corner. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets sort of frightening," said Skid Row team member Karen Palermo. 
"There's only so much we can do to keep the lid on the kettle." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is compounded, Palermo said, by a high incidence of alcoholism and 
drug abuse among the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the mentally ill have been unable to get the medication, 
counseling or hospital treatment they need to function normally, according to 
Dr. Rodger K. Farr, a retired county administrator who in 1981 founded the 
first public mental health clinic on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
"The mental illness problem is the main contributor to the homeless population 
in the Skid Row area -- there's no doubt about it," Farr said. PET members 
"couldn't see one in 10 people they need to see," he added. "There's just so 
much need." 
</P>
<P>
The five-member squad assigned to Skid Row is responsible for a geographic area 
typical of the emergency network -- a swath containing 2 million residents, 
extending from East Los Angeles to Hollywood and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, the squad's case list included the usual daunting 
challenges: a woman nine months pregnant who had begun smashing windows and 
attacking members of her family; a woman living in a clump of bushes west of 
the Harbor Freeway who had been reported looking ill; and a man living in a Los 
Angeles board-and-care home who had been accused of setting fires in an 
upstairs hallway. 
</P>
<P>
So on a cool, blustery day, with those and other cases waiting, team members 
took to the streets. Sharen Reed and Shirley Wright cornered one of their 
targets -- the alleged arsonist -- in the board-and-care home near MacArthur 
Park. He was seated at a lunch table, a gaunt, white-haired man with a hawkish 
face and thick glasses. 
</P>
<P>
The women waited and approached him carefully in a secluded hallway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know you," the patient said defensively, in thick, halting speech. "I 
suggest you leave right now!" He had his own psychiatrist, he said. He was 
being careful -- he knew the communists were after him. 
</P>
<P>
"What are these communist people doing to you?" Reed asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not fool with the county! If you bother me, I'm going to take it up with 
the police or the FBI!" 
</P>
<P>
The building manager arrived, talking to the team out of his earshot. She 
wanted the man taken away -- now. "I've seen him . . . get out there (in 
traffic) and do all kinds of gyrations," she said. "I hold my breath! 
</P>
<P>
"The other night he lit a matchbook on fire on the second floor. With a flaming 
matchbook, he threw it on the carpet! That was observed!" 
</P>
<P>
Had the manager seen it herself, Wright asked. 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
Wright shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a danger," the manager asserted. 
</P>
<P>
The two team members shrugged. Someone would have to keep watching him. 
Besides, they told the building manager, the 1,800 psychiatric beds available 
to Los Angeles County patients were -- as usual -- filled. 
</P>
<P>
Cases can drag on for days, even weeks. Eventually, the suspected arsonist was 
transferred to a smaller board-and-care home where he could be watched more 
closely. Meanwhile, the missing homeless woman who had been living in the 
hedges turned up and was placed in a shelter. As for the runaway pregnant woman 
from Highland Park, she made a surprise appearance at the hospital, delivered 
her baby and -- to the chagrin of team members -- disappeared again. 
</P>
<P>
Once more, the search for her was on. 
</P>
<P>
"She's doing the same thing -- breaking windows, attacking her family," Reed 
said. "We're trying to find her. We've been out to her house five or six times 
. . . (but) she's never there. She's even faster than before she was pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Such problems preoccupy the team day in and day out. "The typical case is not 
very exciting. It's mostly sad," said Ron Klein, who heads a PET squad in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Klein cited one case of a pregnant woman who had begun hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>
"And she was very scared," he said. "She had three other children. (She asked,) 
'What's going to happen to them? What's going to happen to my baby?' And she 
started crying." 
</P>
<P>
"What the team does well," Klein said, "is to interrupt that. (They) assure 
families . . . 'We're going to help you through this.' " 
</P>
<P>
But PET members have to be prepared for danger. For Reed, a three-year veteran, 
the point was rammed home -- repeatedly -- while she was assigned to Arcadia. 
One day a patient's family summoned the team, then took violent exception upon 
realizing the patient would be hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
The task was carried out, but Reed couldn't flee quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The family followed us from Pasadena to Arcadia on the freeway, ramming our 
car," she recalled. "They kept chasing us. We finally went directly to the 
Arcadia Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mackey, a 10-year veteran based in Santa Monica, recalled a time when a 
mentally disturbed woman leveled a cocked shotgun at him. He dove behind a 
station wagon, circled it and managed to blindside her and take away the gun, 
he said. She was then taken away, with police help, to a psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The shotgun made no difference about the (involuntary) hold," Mackey said. 
"Even if she hadn't pulled the gun, we had decided she was going to the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever possible, cases are screened by phone, and if there is the chance of 
violence police will accompany the team. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the team functioned as an around-the-clock emergency service. But 
since last fall, calls received after 5 p.m. or on holidays are forwarded to a 
central screening office at Metropolitan State Hospital, a state-run 
psychiatric facility in Norwalk, which rarely dispatches people into the field. 
Callers generally are urged to wait until morning or, if a danger exists, to 
notify police. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Gabriel, we used to do 175 to 250 after-hour calls a month," county 
official Wells recalled. "Now, zero." 
</P>
<P>
The problem has thrust a greater share of the burden onto police. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are other difficulties. One is what team members call 
"Greyhound therapy" -- the practice by other states of dealing with their 
mentally ill by putting them on a bus to Los Angeles. They disembark at the 
Greyhound terminal near Skid Row, adding to the caseload. Almost invariably, 
they are without family, doctors or adequate insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, 51, a 20-year PET veteran, called the practice just one more cause of 
job burnout. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes not just from having a lot of work to do, but from having a lot of 
work that can't be done the way it should," he said. ". . . You want to do 
something and just can't. You get up against four or five of them a week, or 10 
or 12 a week, and it starts getting to you." 
</P>
<P>
Russell noted that, in most cases, PET members never know the ultimate fate of 
their patients, "because we send them off somewhere, and you never hear from 
them again." But every once in a while, walking Skid Row, he sees a familiar 
face -- one that's cleaned up, looking a little more proud. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll holler, 'How you doing?' " Russell said. "He'll say, 'I'm doing fine! 
I'm taking my medication. I'm going to a board-and-care home.' They're off the 
streets . . . they have a destination, rather than just walking around."

L.A. PARKING TICKETS: ROLE OF FIRM IS QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, when Los Angeles contracted with Datacom Systems Corp. to collect 
delinquent parking tickets, the company projected it could collect 5% to 10% of 
the city's unpaid citations. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with unpaid fines reported at nearly $249 million, the company has 
collected $5.6 million -- slightly over 2% -- and has not yet resorted to the 
aggressive ticket collection methods spelled out in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Some elected officials are asking whether more money could be collected, 
especially now that the city faces fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley recently ordered the city's Department of Transportation to 
report by this week on the status of collection efforts, and some City Council 
members recently have questioned whether the contractor has done an adequate 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"Their performance has been inadequate," said Councilman Nate Holden, who 
chairs the council's Traffic and Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we were able to get 20% of $250 million, that's . . . $50 million," 
said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Finance and Revenue Committee. 
"That could go a long way to dealing with our budgetary problems." 
</P>
<P>
City parking officials praise the contractor's collections approach and note 
that 70% of the tickets written each year are paid. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the outstanding $249 million is uncollectable, parking officials say, 
because the owners of the ticketed vehicles cannot be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like milking blood out of a turnip," said Jay Carsman, the city's parking 
ticket coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Datacom, currently known as Lockheed Information Management Services Co., has 
been paid $32 million to process the city's parking tickets since 1985 and has 
received at least $1.3 million more to collect delinquent tickets in the last 
year. The contract comes up for renewal later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed already has come under fire for its ticket collection efforts in Los 
Angeles. Last year, the city received a storm of complaints after the company 
sent 50,000 ticket notices to people who did not own the vehicles when the 
parking citations were issued. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Information Management Services, a Teaneck, N.J.-based subsidiary of 
defense contractor Lockheed Corp., has been no stranger to controversy. When it 
was called Datacom, the company was implicated in the political corruption 
scandals of New York City four years ago. One former city official and a local 
Democratic leader were convicted of paying bribes to obtain business for 
Datacom, and a former president of the company testified that he had authorized 
bribe payments. 
</P>
<P>
The company, though not charged with any crime, lost its contract in New York 
City and suffered negative publicity around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the company has installed new leadership, instituted an ethics 
program and made a number of other changes, according to Thomas J. O'Neil, 
Lockheed Information Systems senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult time," O'Neil said in an interview. "It probably 
served to make us tougher and better." 
</P>
<P>
While becoming an acknowledged leader in the municipal parking industry, 
Lockheed has lobbied energetically for contracts in several cities and has 
hired a number of former government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Lockheed/Datacom and its officials have contributed at least 
$71,400 to city and county elected officials in Los Angeles, with about half of 
the money given to Bradley, campaign records show. The company also has hired 
Julie A. Sgarzi, who served as a transportation aide to Bradley from 1977 to 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
As a regional vice president for Lockheed, Sgarzi served as project manager 
when the company signed its five-year contract with the city in 1985. She is 
now a senior vice president. Last year, the mayor appointed Sgarzi to the 
Cultural Affairs Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The current head of Lockheed's Los Angeles office is Edgar Hayes, who 
previously was director of data processing for Los Angeles County. Lockheed 
holds a $2.6-million, three-year contract with Los Angeles County to process 
parking citations for county unincorporated areas and several cities, according 
to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We have hired folks from the public sector," said O'Neil, who himself had been 
a Boston official before he went to work for Datacom in that city. "How better 
to understand the process? It is logical, ethical, and moral." 
</P>
<P>
The company currently processes parking citations for 100 U.S. cities or 
counties, O'Neil said, including Boston, Washington and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
At least 250 cities and counties contract out such services, according to Marie 
Witmer of the Institutional and Municipal Parking Congress, a Virginia-based 
clearinghouse on parking issues. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's relationship with Los Angeles began in the early 1980s when the City 
Council sought to increase revenue by centralizing the city's fragmented 
parking enforcement, citation processing and collections system. In 1983, the 
council selected Datacom and a consultant, Brophy &amp; Associates, to perform 
a study that led to the current system. 
</P>
<P>
Brophy &amp; Associates was headed by John Brophy, now president of Lockheed 
Information Management Services. A former Washington parking official, he has 
marketed the idea that cities could make a lot of money through centralized 
parking management combined with aggressive ticketing, towing and use of metal 
"boots" to immobilize cars with several outstanding tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, his ideas appealed to officials in a number of cities 
facing increasingly tight budgets, including Los Angeles. In 1984, the mayor 
and council decided to implement the Brophy/Datacom concept. The next year 
Datacom won a five-year contract to implement its own plan, beating out three 
other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the number of tickets issued by traffic officers employed by the 
city's Department of Transportation has quadrupled to 4.3 million, and revenue 
has climbed from $18 million in 1984 to $90 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Under its contract, Lockheed uses its computer system to process tickets and 
track payments, and the company staffs the city's payment offices. The company 
is paid $1.18 to $2.48 to process each ticket, whether the fine is paid or not. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, the City Council approved a contract amendment authorizing 
Lockheed to collect fines on delinquent tickets for a 30% commission. The city 
attorney ruled the contract award could be made without competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
When the contract was awarded, officials who oversee parking collections told 
the council that the city had 800,000 unpaid citations amounting to $35 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, officials told The Times that there are 5.4 million unpaid citations 
worth nearly $249 million. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how much money is collectable, city officials and Lockheed have 
provided estimates ranging from $35 million to $162 million. They said the 
amount would be clarified in their report to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro said through a spokesman last week that he 
is "totally surprised by the disparity in numbers and wants an investigation 
into the facts." 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-five million dollars is a far cry from $249 million," Holden said. "My 
question is what are they talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
Holden voted against the additional contract award because of Lockheed Corp.'s 
past business ties to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's 1989 agreement with the city said the company could pursue an array 
of ticket collection strategies such as skip-tracing -- a method of finding 
valid current addresses -- and making telephone collection calls. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, Lockheed's collection efforts have been limited to sending 
letters to non-paying parking violators. 
</P>
<P>
City parking officials say they jointly decided on a strategy of sending 
letters as a first stage of collection before resorting to more aggressive 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
"That strategy is in the process of being reviewed," said Parking Administrator 
Robert Yates, who oversees the contractor's operations for the city's 
Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Times recently reported that 75,000 vehicles had five or more tickets, and 
that the top violators each owed several thousand dollars in fines. 
</P>
<P>
After inquiries from The Times, prosecutors from the city attorney's office met 
with parking officials to consider ways to seek payment from the worst parking 
violators, some of whom have up to 200 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Maureen Siegel, acting chief of criminal operations, said: 
"We're looking at prosecution remedies, civil remedies and legislative changes 
that could impact our ability to collect a larger percentage of unpaid fines." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's contract with the city expires this fall. Lockheed has submitted 
proposals to win the new contract, along with Andersen Consulting, a division 
of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., and Tixon Corp. of Detroit.

IT ISN'T PRETTY, BUT HEARNS EASILY BEATS OLAJIDE

<P>
It took a ninth-round knockdown by Thomas Hearns to bring out the fighting 
desire of Michael Olajide Saturday night at the Taj Majal Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
But it was too late to prevent Hearns from winning a unanimous 12-round 
decision in the World Boxing Organization super-middleweight title bout. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns, fighting for the first time since a draw with Sugar Ray Leonard last 
June 12, said he wasn't entirely pleased with his performance, rating it a "six 
or seven" on a scale of 1-10. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't an easy night for me," Hearns said. "My punches were not crisp and 
sharp." 
</P>
<P>
One that was crisp and sharp was the right hand that dropped Olajide early in 
the ninth round. Olajide got up at the count of seven and withstood a barrage 
of punches while on the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
The punches seemed to tire Hearns and bring Olajide out of his defensive shell. 
The challenger landed several rights near the end of the round, the first round 
that had any real exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"He got a little bit reckless," Olajide said. "I tried to wait out the storm. I 
knew it was going to be formidable. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should have thrown caution to the wind a little earlier," Olajide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Olajide appeared to wobble Hearns briefly at the start of the 10th round with a 
right, but Hearns re-established his jab, as he had in the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The two exchanged solid rights in the 11th, but Hearns managed to keep away 
from Olajide for the rest of the fight and score solidly with left hooks and 
jabs. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Tony Orlando deducted a point from Olajide in the fourth round for a 
low blow that disabled Hearns for about 30 seconds. Hearns had dominated the 
round up to that point, leaving both his arms at his side and taunting Olajide 
between blows. 
</P>
<P>
That set the pattern for rounds 5 though 8, with Hearns landing occasional left 
hooks to the body before Olajide danced away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to hit him when he's constantly moving," Hearns said. "Every time I 
tried to cut off the ring he runs and he ducks." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Vincent Rainone scored the fight 119-107, Samuel Conde had it 120-107 and 
Cesar Ramos scored it 119-110. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns is 47-3-1 with 38 knockouts, and Olajide is 27-3 with 19 knockouts. 
Hearns, 31, of Detroit, weighed 168, the maximum for the super-middleweight 
class. Olajide, 26, of New York, weighed 166 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns, the only man to win titles in five weight classes, was making his 17th 
appearance in a major title fight. He won his first championship as a 147-pound 
welterweight in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
His career has included knockout losses in classic bouts with Marvelous Marvin 
Hagler and Leonard, plus last year's controversial draw with Leonard -- a fight 
many thought that he won. 
</P>
<P>
He said he again would like to fight Leonard, who sat next to Donald Trump, the 
owner of the Taj Majal Hotel.

HORSE RACING DERBY TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSEBUSTER'S PERFORMANCE A GANGBUSTER 
</P>

<P>
Trainer Steve Penrod, whose horse had just been beaten by more than eight 
lengths in Saturday's Derby Trial, feels that Housebuster, the winner of the 
stake, ought to be running in the Kentucky Derby next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse (Falling Sky, who finished third) didn't have any business in this 
race, let alone the Derby," Penrod said. "Housebuster's an awfully fast horse. 
I think he'd be trouble if he ran in the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bob Levy and trainer Jimmy Croll have both said all year Housebuster 
won't be running in the Derby, and they didn't waver Saturday after the 
workmanlike colt won the Trial by 5 1/4 lengths over Private School as 
Churchill Downs opened its season before 21,600 on a gray, rainy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse's sire (Mt. Livermore) was a sprinter, his mother (Big Dreams) was 
a sprinter and he's built like a sprinter," Levy said. "An Eclipse Award (for 
sprinting) comes first, before everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Levy did, however, leave the door open for Housebuster to run in the Preakness, 
the second Triple Crown race, at Pimlico on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
"If Craig (Perret) comes up after the Derby and says that we ought to run in 
the Preakness, then we would have to think about it," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
Perret rides both Housebuster and Unbridled, the Florida Derby winner who will 
be running in the 1 1/4-mile Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, when Housebuster hit the top of Churchill Down's long stretch, 
Perret looked over his right shoulder and saw no one coming. He looked over his 
left shoulder and saw no challengers on the inside. Then he looked over his 
right shoulder again and put away his unused whip. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying he could win the Derby, but he's done everything we've asked of 
him so far," Perret said. "I wouldn't like to see him run in the Derby. But I 
think he'll get a distance." 
</P>
<P>
In the seven-furlong Swale Stakes at Gulfstream Park on March 17, Housebuster 
beat Summer Squall, the Derby co-favorite with Mister Frisky, by one length. 
Thirty Six Red, another leading contender for the Derby, finished third, seven 
lengths behind Housebuster. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster paid $2.40 to win in the Trial, running the mile in 1:37 3/5 on a 
track that was officially fast, but dead because of intermittent showers. 
</P>
<P>
After Private School and Falling Sky, the order of finish was Five on Five, 
Spiced Coffee and Bates Castle, with Blue Royal scratched. None of the horses 
is expected to run in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, worth $54,453, was the seventh in eighth starts for Housebuster. 
He's been undefeated since he ran third at the Meadowlands last October in his 
first start. 
</P>
<P>
The Trial was the first time Housebuster ran as far as a mile. Races under 
consideration for him are all in New York -- the Withers at a mile on May 9; 
the Metropolitan Handicap, also a mile, on May 28; and the Riva Ridge, at seven 
furlongs, on June 9, the same day as the Belmont Stakes. If Easy Goer runs in 
the Metropolitan, Levy said that Housebuster would skip that race. 
</P>
<P>
And there's still the possibility of the Preakness, which is 1 3/16 miles. At 
Pimlico, Housebuster would be a viable spoiler for any Derby winner trying for 
the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally left Silver Ending at Churchill Downs to make a phone call 
to his barn at Hollywood Park Saturday morning, and while he was gone, the 
Arkansas Derby winner kicked himself in the right hind leg, sustaining a small 
cut. Silver Ending was examined by a Churchill Downs veterinarian, and McAnally 
didn't feel the injury was serious. Silver Ending was given a painkiller, and 
McAnally said that the colt will have his final pre-Kentucky Derby workout, as 
scheduled, today. 
</P>
<P>
"He was being sponged off at the barn when he kicked himself," McAnally said. 
"He should have been in his stall when that was being done, instead of outside. 
If he weren't putting his weight on the leg, I'd be worried, but he is applying 
weight, so I believe he's OK. Isn't it something? I'm gone for five minutes and 
this happens." 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, with the heat gone from his left front ankle, galloped about 1 
1/4 miles Saturday morning. X-rays were taken of Mister Frisky's ankle on 
Friday and they were negative. Mister Frisky is scheduled to be reshod today 
and work five-eighths of a mile Tuesday. . . . Eddie Delahoussaye will not ride 
Video Ranger in the Derby. Delahoussaye, who finished second with Video Ranger 
to Mister Frisky in the Santa Anita Derby, has often said that he won't go to 
the Kentucky Derby unless his chances are good. . . . Summer Squall is 
scheduled to work a half-mile on Wednesday. . . . Thirty Six Red, the Wood 
Memorial winner, worked five furlongs Saturday in 1:05 4/5. Trainer Nick Zito 
said he didn't want the colt running any faster than that. . . . Trainer Ron 
Sarazin was not happy with Shot Gun Scott's six-furlong workout in 1:16 2/5.

A LOOK AT THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE NFL DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM JENKINS, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the introduction of Plan B free agency last year, NFL teams no longer are 
as dependent on the draft. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers and the Green Bay Packers have proved that. If they 
have enough lockers for everyone, the Dallas Cowboys hope they can, too. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the draft is the only real marketplace for fresh talent. And for all the 
talk about the deep pockets of 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo, his organization 
has been able to properly scout college players each year and do something with 
them once they are turned over to the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is the middle- to low-round starters on a team shooting for its 
third straight Super Bowl title. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about the 49ers is that they've always been able to develop 
players," Mel Kiper, longtime draft analyst, said Wednesday. "They're very 
patient. They've still got the best organization in football. I haven't had a 
chance to completely study their draft, but I know they'll do well again." 
</P>
<P>
Kiper's big winners in the draft were New England, the New York Jets and 
Atlanta, "because they made trades and got people to fit their needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His big losers were Indianapolis, Denver and Buffalo, "because the Colts gave 
up too much in the trade (to obtain the No. 1 choice from Atlanta and select 
quarterback Jeff George), the Broncos needed and didn't get a cornerback, and 
the Bills didn't draft a running back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NFC WEST 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers' reign atop the NFL didn't appear threatened by 
anything that happened in the draft Sunday and Monday. Nevertheless, the 
defending champions might do well to keep an eye on the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
For all the talking coach Jerry Glanville does, he can produce. 
</P>
<P>
Without total say-so over personnel decisions in Houston, Glanville turned the 
Oilers into a repeat playoff team. With more authority in Atlanta and a better 
nucleus to build on, he could be one more draft and a few trades from making 
the Falcons a force. 
</P>
<P>
In grading the draft, no one emerged in a better position than the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Competing in the rugged NFC West with the 49ers, Los Angeles Rams and New 
Orleans Saints, the Falcons deserve an "A" for trading the draft's first pick 
to Indianapolis for Pro Bowl offensive tackle Chris Hinton, a seven-time Pro 
Bowl selection; wide receiver Andre Rison, a budding young star who gave the 
49ers fits last season; and the Colts' first-round pick in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, they got all that just so the Colts could mortgage their current and 
immediate future by drafting Illinois junior quarterback Jeff George. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we were able to upgrade our offense," said Kent Herock, the Falcons' 
vice president in charge of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Many Colts fans, polled by the local media, thought the team paid too much. And 
there were some disbelievers around the league, including the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons also used a first-round pick they acquired earlier from Washington 
to pick running back Steve Broussard from Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Deion Sanders, drafted first last year, was an early addition to a 
rebuilding defense. Atlanta's second-round pick this year, linebacker Darion 
Conner from Jackson State, is another who is termed a "certified killer" by 
Glanville, who already has changed the Falcons' uniforms to black with red 
trim. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got enough players now to shake some people up," Herock said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, meanwhile, deserve little more than a "C" for their choices. No 
longer benefiting from the the bonanza of high picks from the Eric Dickerson 
trade, they went for Washington center Bern Brostek. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, like the 49ers, the Rams didn't need much and seeking new blood for a 
good but aging offensive line made sense. But Brostek may have back problems 
and, frankly, was someone 49ers offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick thumbed 
his nose at as lacking mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Rams coach John Robinson thinks he improved his secondary by choosing Notre 
Dame safety Pat Terrell in round two. In the fifth round, however, the Rams 
made their best move of the draft. They traded their pick and got cornerback 
Bobby Humphery, 28, a starter the past two years for the New York Jets. He 
could take some pressure off Los Angeles' Pro Bowl corner Jerry Gray. 
</P>
<P>
In New Orleans, coach Jim Mora refused to rate the Saints draft. OK, others can 
do that. A "B" sounds fair. 
</P>
<P>
With 16 picks in 12 rounds, the Saints made five of their first seven choices 
on defense, winding up with nine defensive players overall. Heading the list 
was defensive end Renaldo Turnbull from West Virginia, who is touted as a 
player who can help the Saints' talented linebackers put some heat on the 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
With veteran quarterback Bobby Hebert free to shop his services to a new team, 
the Saints went after two young prospects at the position. Six-foot-3, 
227-pound Mike Buck of Maine, who had 8,884 career passing yards, was chosen in 
the sixth round and Gerry Gdowski of Nebraska in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers get a "B," but then the champions are so deep at most positions they 
had the luxury of drafting for situation players. Top pick Dexter Carter, a 
small but tough running back out of Florida State, adds an element to the 
offense they've been after for some time -- a quick, darting runner who can 
catch the ball and return kicks. A highlight film shows that Carter carries 
everything in his left hand even when changing direction, something San 
Francisco coaches may want to correct. 
</P>
<P>
The development of Darrell Pollard as a starting cornerback, the signing of 
former All-Pro Hanford Dixon from Cleveland as a Plan B free agent and the 
drafting of Eric Davis of Jacksonville State in the second round enabled the 
49ers to trade disruptive Tim McKyer to the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive lineman Dennis Brown, a 305-pounder from Washington, was taken in the 
second round with Davis. He can play end but prefers nose tackle, giving the 
49ers a potential replacement for Michael Carter, who is coming off foot 
surgery and turns 30 in October. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had everyone from the outside believing their draft priority was a 
linebacker, even if they had to deal their prized backup quarterback Steve 
Young. None of that materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you get by with what you have at linebacker?" coach George Seifert was 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
A smile broke over Seifert's face. "We expect to do more than just get by," 
said Seifert, fortunate to have at his disposal a title-spoiled owner with a 
bottomless wallet for trades and free agents. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain sense of security with the veteran players and leaders that 
we have," Seifert said. "The players who beat them out will have to be very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NFC CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
CHICAGO: The Bears' No. 1 objective was defensive improvement, especially in 
the secondary, where USC safety Mark Carrier was their first pick. Seven other 
choices on defense included Texas Christian tackle Fred Washington and Fresno 
State linebacker Ron Cox in the second round. Florida State quarterback Peter 
Tom Willis was a third-round selection. Grade: B. 
</P>
<P>
DETROIT: Quarterback Andre Ware from Houston, weaned on the run-and-shoot 
offense, was the ideal first-round selection for the Lions' scatter-gun attack 
and passing coach Mouse Davis. That Ware is a junior didn't scare the Detroit 
brain trust, which saw Barry Sanders, who left Oklahoma State after his junior 
season, finish second in the league in rushing last season. Six of the next 
seven choices went for defense, including Pitt's Marc Spindler, who had been 
projected as a first-round pick. Grade B+. 
</P>
<P>
GREEN BAY: The Packers used first-round picks on linebacker Tony Bennett from 
Mississippi, projected as a second-rounder by some, and running back Darrell 
Thompson from Minnesota. All-America cornerback LeRoy Butler from Florida 
State, a school that produced three 49ers picks, was taken in the second round 
and may be a remedy for age at that spot. Grade: B+. 
</P>
<P>
MINNESOTA: Ten Plan B signees gave the Vikings some leverage to look for an 
outside linebacker and an offensive tackle, two positions they wanted to 
upgrade with the draft. But with no picks in the opening two rounds because of 
the Herschel Walker trade with Dallas, their best choice may have been 
Pittsburgh cornerback Alonzo Hampton in the fourth round. Coach Jerry Burns 
says his team is "solid from bottom to top." It had better be. The Vikings also 
have no picks in the first two rounds of the 1991 and 1992 drafts. Grade: C-. 
</P>
<P>
TAMPA BAY: The Buccaneers' draft has to be graded on a curve. Coach Ray Perkins 
didn't seem to care that linebacker Keith McCants, who played for him at 
Alabama and was once the consensus No. 1 pick in the draft, would need 
arthroscopic knee surgery and can be a discipline problem. He still took him in 
the first round. The second-round pick, running back Reggie Cobb from 
Tennessee, also is a talent but is a repeat drug abuser. More running help to 
keep the heat off quarterback Vinny Testaverde came with the predraft 
acquisition of former San Diego Charger Gary Anderson, but the defensive line 
is still lacking. Grade for now: C+. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NFC EAST 
</P>
<P>
DALLAS: The Cowboys are on a course to rebuild America's Team in a hurry. They 
signed the most Plan B free agents, swapped with the 49ers to obtain running 
back Terrence Flagler and defensive end Danny Stubbs and then traded up to 
draft Florida running back Emmitt Smith in the first round. Having only five 
picks, however, may have left coach Jimmy Johnson short of defensive help. The 
No. 2 pick was defensive end Jimmy Jones from Miami, who shared playing time 
most of his four seasons. Grade: C+. 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK: By picking one turn earlier than the 49ers in the first round, the 
Giants beat San Francisco to Georgia running back Rodney Hampton, then went 
wild in picking five defensive linemen, including West Virginia tackle Mike Fox 
in the second round and Miami end Greg Mark in the third. No selections, 
though, were made on outside linebacking help for Lawrence Taylor and Chip 
Banks. Interesting thinking, too, was the choice of Pacific Lutheran 
quarterback David Kupp in the fifth round. Imagine how West Virginia's Major 
Harris, taken in the 12th round by the Los Angeles Raiders, must have felt. 
Grade: C+. 
</P>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA: Does anyone know what coach Buddy Ryan is up to? He drafted 
Georgia safety Ben Smith in the first round, proclaiming him a starter and 
infuriating some veterans. Then the Eagles, with Mike Quick's knees suspect, 
went on a shopping spree for three receivers, including Mike Bellamy, George's 
favorite target at Illinois, in the second round. A defensive back or an 
offensive lineman taken higher might have addressed equally pressing needs. 
Grade: C. 
</P>
<P>
PHOENIX: Like the New York Jets, the Cardinals always have been capable of 
disappointing their fans in the draft, but things weren't so bad this time. 
Having spent their first-round pick in the supplemental draft last year on 
quarterback Timm Rosenbach, the Cardinals opted for Indiana running back 
Anthony Thompson in the second round. That was to remedy an aging backfield. 
For needed depth in the defensive line, they took nose Michigan State tackle 
Travis Davis as their third choice. Grade: B-. 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON: Now that trade-happy Bobby Beathard is running things in San Diego, 
maybe the Redskins can hang on to a first-round pick. With none this time 
around, they took linebacker Andre Collins from Penn State in the second round 
and guard Mohammed Elewonibi from Brigham Young, who flunked some physicals, in 
the third round. Needs in the secondary were ignored. Grade: C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFC WEST 
</P>
<P>
DENVER: The defending conference champs, who also dipped into the 1989 
supplemental draft for running back Bobby Humphrey, were hampered with no picks 
in the first and third rounds. Their second-round choice brought Houston's 
Alton Montgomery, who will be an understudy to Dennis Smith at strong safety. 
The fourth-round pick, Texas A&amp;M linebacker Jeroy Robinson, could be a 
steal. Grade: B-. 
</P>
<P>
KANSAS CITY: The Chiefs, looking for a game-breaking receiver, came up empty. 
They seem happy with their first-round choice, Percy Snow, but the stock of the 
Michigan State linebacker dropped with some teams. Notre Dame center-guard Tom 
Grunhard, a second-round pick, is a deep snapper and a replacement for Mike 
Webster. Ken Hackenmack, a 6-foot-9, 300-pound defensive tackle from Texas, was 
an intriguing fifth-round choice. Grade: B+. 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES: Whatever happened to the mystique of the Raiders around draft 
time? Their first pick, Arizona defensive end Anthony Smith, was considered a 
surprise choice by many. The second pick, Texas A&amp;M linebacker Aaron 
Wallace, is said to be a weak pass defender. The Raiders loaded up on 
middle-round choices through trades, but there doesn't appear to be any help 
for the offensive line. Grade: C. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO: It was a sweet draft with Beathard at the helm, headed by USC junior 
linebacker Junior Seau, one of the best players available. Seattle, no doubt 
figuring Beathard would take Cortez Kennedy, Miami's terrific defensive tackle, 
leapfrogged ahead of the Chargers by trading with New England. Still, the 
Chargers weren't damaged in their effort to improve their pass rush, because 
Seau can be a force all over the field. Grade: B+. 
</P>
<P>
SEATTLE: The Seahawks traded two first-round picks with the Patriots to snatch 
Kennedy, then used their second-round pick on Syracuse linebacker Terry Wooden, 
whom the 49ers supposedly liked. Seattle had several holes to fill, including 
running back, with Curt Warner having signed with the Rams. The draft didn't 
fill that void, but with linebacker Brian Bosworth out of commission, Kennedy 
promises to bring the "Nasty Boys" back to Seattle. Grade: B+. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFC CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
CINCINNATI: The Bengals, who ranked 26th against the run last season and lost 
linebacker Reggie Williams to retirement, used their first and third picks on 
linebackers -- Baylor's James Francis and Miami's Bernard Clark. Both are 
proven run-stuffers. South Carolina running back Harold Green, who went in the 
second round because of a stampede for junior talent, could be a steal for 
coach Sam Wyche's multiple offense. Grade: A. 
</P>
<P>
CLEVELAND: The Browns' first-round pick went to Green Bay for receiver Lawyer 
Tillman, so Michigan running back Leroy Hoard was their opening choice in the 
second round. He was the only back to rush for 100 yards against USC in 
successive seasons. Tennessee State defensive end Anthony Pleasant went in the 
third round but may have to add weight. Grade: C. 
</P>
<P>
HOUSTON: The transition from the Jerry Glanville era to the Jack Pardee era 
begins. The first pick, linebacker Lamar Lathon, is from Pardee's previous 
station, the University of Houston, so he knows what to expect on defense. Jeff 
Alm, a defensive tackle from Notre Dame taken in the second round, was a menace 
in big games, particularly at batting down passes. Grade: A-. 
</P>
<P>
PITTSBURGH: Enough scouts knew that Eric Green was a standout small-college 
player. Nevertheless, when the Steelers made the 6-4, 275-pound tight end from 
Liberty their top choice, there were some gasps in the draft room. Needs at 
defensive back, linebacker and wide receiver weren't tended to until later. 
Defensive end Ken Davidson from Louisiana State, taken in the second round, was 
moved from tight end and offensive tackle in school before settling in on 
defense. Grade: C-. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFC EAST 
</P>
<P>
BUFFALO: Drafting a psychiatrist wouldn't have been a bad idea for the Bills, 
whose bickering didn't help them late last season. The choice instead was to go 
for Fresno State cornerback James Williams, with 4.29 speed, in the first round 
and Louisville fullback Carwell Gardner, a dubious pick, in the second round. 
With former All-Pro Fred Smerlas exiting through Plan B to the 49ers, the Bills 
failed to obtain backup help for Jeff Wright at nose tackle. Grade: C-. 
</P>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS: The Colts may have given up the farm to get a bell cow. By 
trading proven players to Atlanta for the No. 1 pick, they hope they have a 
franchise player in George. Waiting for his development could be painful on 
impatient Colts fans. The Colts took Notre Dame fullback Anthony Johnson in the 
second round, but some wonder about his athletic ability. With standout lineman 
Chris Hinton gone, an offensive lineman should have been drafted higher than 
the 12th round. Grade: D. 
</P>
<P>
MIAMI: Coach Don Shula's first-round pick, Texas A&amp;M tackle Richmond Webb, 
was the best offensive lineman in the draft. Second-round pick Keith Sims, an 
offensive guard from Iowa State, was flown in by the 49ers for a predraft 
tryout. Scott Mitchell, Utah's junior quarterback, may be a bargain 
fourth-round pick. Needs for the defensive line and linebacking weren't filled, 
but by giving up an 11th-round choice and their No. 2 next year to San 
Francisco, they landed a starting cornerback in Tim McKyer. Grade: A-. 
</P>
<P>
NEW ENGLAND: The rebuilding Patriots gave up the third overall pick in the 
draft to Seattle for the eighth and 10th choices and took linebacker Chris 
Singleton from Arizona and defensive end Ray Agnew from North Carolina State. 
If some of their defensive stars come back from injuries, the Patriots should 
be all right on defense. On offense, the need remains for a quarterback despite 
the third-round choice of Louisiana State's Tom Hodson. Grade: B+. 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK: Compared to past disasters, this was one of the Jets' best drafts in 
years under new front-office chief Dick Steinberg. Running back Blair Thomas 
from Penn State, the second overall pick, was a first-round plum, and wide 
receiver Reggie Rembert from West Virginia, taken in the second round, and 
cornerback Tony Stargell from Tennessee State, selected in the third, should 
help. Grade: B-.

MIKE DOWNEY: OREL SURGERY CUTS DODGERS TO THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orel Hershiser is hurting -- hurting inside his arm, hurting inside his heart. 
</P>
<P>
He has something wrong with his right shoulder, and Orel Hershiser cannot make 
a living without his right shoulder. He needs it the way a concert pianist 
needs hands, the way a high-rise construction worker needs eyes. Without a 
sound right shoulder, Orel Hershiser, 31 years old, must find another line of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pity, a tragedy, an occupational hazard with which colleagues from 
Fernando Valenzuela to John Tudor can empathize. It is a crying shame, and 
indeed, Orel Hershiser cried. He choked up last Thursday on the Dodger Stadium 
infield with a microphone in his face the way he never once choked up there 
with a baseball in his hand. And it hurts to see a grown man cry, particularly 
this grown man. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, like Valenzuela, epitomizes everything one would want out of a Los 
Angeles Dodger or out of a baseball player or out of a professional athlete. He 
leads, by all outward appearances, a virtuous life. He is, with rare exception, 
pleasant to strangers and patient with children. He speaks with intelligence 
and eloquence and is refreshingly free of profanity. He is hardly St. Orel, but 
on the whole he really is the sort of guy you would expect to endorse not beer 
nor shaving lather, but Johnson's Baby Shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
If Hershiser does not make it back this season, which appears likely, it is Los 
Angeles' loss. If Hershiser does not make it back ever, it is everybody's loss. 
He is good for the game. He is a good man at whom to point your finger when you 
nudge your son and say: "Now this guy's what I call a ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
Not once have we read or written a word about speeding tickets or income tax 
evasion or hidden mistresses where Orel Hershiser is concerned, and here's 
betting we never will. The Dodgers practically have had their own motto every 
spring: Let he who is without sin cast the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Where vice is concerned, to our knowledge, about as madcap as Hershiser gets is 
to run over to Atlantic City when the Dodgers are in Philadelphia and drop a 
bundle on one deal of baccarat, as Rick Dempsey once got a kick out of telling. 
</P>
<P>
Before anybody frets about bad gambling habits, remember, this is the same 
Hershiser who donated stacks of money to charity, who dared Tom Lasorda to drop 
some weight, doubled the bet to keep Tommy dieting, and, in so doing, lowered 
the manager's cholesterol while raising thousands of dollars for a Tennessee 
nunnery. 
</P>
<P>
We do not usually get too worked up over an athlete's injury, but this one 
means more to the Dodgers than just complicating their current predicament in 
which their star outfielder, stopper relief pitcher, starting third baseman, 
backup catcher and ace pitcher have been banished to the infirmary. 
</P>
<P>
Stripping Fernando Valenzuela and Orel Hershiser from the Dodgers was like 
removing their heart and soul. Valenzuela still has the heart and stubbornness 
of a bull, but his arm is nothing like it once was. Hershiser is the soul and 
spiritual leader of the Dodgers in many ways, the perfect counterpoint to Kirk 
Gibson's volatility or Mickey Hatcher's tomfoolery. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow we get the feeling that we will not be the only one today wishing Orel 
Hershiser a full recovery, for our sake as well as his. He is needed. Guys like 
him are rare. 
</P>
<P>
He gave audiences thrills beyond belief in 1988, stringing zeroes along the 
scoreboard and volunteering for desperate-situation bullpen duty and ultimately 
making the free-swinging Oakland Athletics wave at his offerings like 
blindfolded men playing Wiffleball. He sang hymns in the dugout and knelt in 
prayer near the mound. He was almost too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
So . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dear Orel: 
</P>
<P>
It won't be the same here without you. Dodgers have been pitching baseballs for 
100 years, but few any better than you. 
</P>
<P>
We appreciate all that you did and all that you were going to do. We know that 
life plays as many tricks on a ballplayer as a breaking pitch does, and in your 
particular line of work, as you know, not everything is fair. 
</P>
<P>
We also know that you have a higher authority to consult about all this, and we 
don't mean Lasorda. There is a good head under that red hair and blue cap, so 
keep it on straight. 
</P>
<P>
If worse comes to worst, we've seen the way you hit. Don't forget, Roy Hobbs 
came back as a right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Be a patient patient, and tell the doctor he'll get credited for a save. 
</P>
<P>
And thanks. Thanks for the memories. If you can, come back and give us some 
more.

Villanova's women completed their second consecutive distance "triple," and 
Arkansas raced to its sixth consecutive victory in the men's 6,000-meter relay 
in the Penn Relays in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Christian's men won the 400-meter and 800-meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova held on to win the 3,200-meter relay, adding that title to the 
distance medley relay championship it won Thursday and the 6,000-meter relay 
crown from Friday. Fifth-year senior Kathy Franey anchored all three victories. 
</P>
<P>
With a team of Gilbert Contreras, Eric Henry, Johan Boakes and Reuben Reina, 
Arkansas was timed in a fast 14 minutes, 54.89 seconds. It was the 
second-fastest clocking of its six consecutive victories, behind only the 
14:50.2 in 1985.

ATHLETICS PITCHER DAVE STEWART IS THE GENUINE ARTICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Stewart did not go to Disneyland after the World Series. He did, however, 
go see the kids at the Ossian Carr Clubhouse, a chipped, cracked Boys Club 
house in Oakland, not far from where he was raised. Stewart went so many times, 
in fact, that he lost count. 
</P>
<P>
He also spent a lot of time at another Boys Club house in Oakland, went into 
seven elementary and middle schools to talk to kids, went into a dozen other 
schools gathering toys for the underprivileged at Christmas, helped organize 
four fund-raisers for victims of the Bay Area earthquake and testified before a 
Senate subcommittee on the necessities of sports for kids. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and he also put on a charity picnic that raised $35,000, helped run his 
non-profit organization and spent countless hours on the schoolyards and 
playgrounds where he was weaned, playing basketball and baseball and just 
mingling. "If there was a softball game going on and they had an extra glove, I 
played," Stewart said Wednesday in the Oakland Athletics' clubhouse at Memorial 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
You would think he did not leave enough time to keep his pitching arm in shape. 
Wrong. Coming off a year in which he won 21 games and was named the World 
Series' Most Valuable Player, he is off to a 4-0 start after beating the 
Orioles the other night, looking very much on his way to his fourth straight 
20-win season. Baseball does not have a more dependable pitcher right now. 
</P>
<P>
"But when the average person comes up to me on the street," he said, "they tell 
me that while what I'm doing on the ball field is great, what I'm doing off the 
field, going back into the community and giving back, that's what the people 
tell me they really appreciate the most." 
</P>
<P>
In these difficult, cynical days, with millionaire ballplayers charging for 
autographs and bubble-gum cards trading for hundreds of dollars, we have come 
to suspect that publicists are behind stories of warm-hearted athletes. We have 
seen too many stars who lectured on drugs wind up in detox. Our reflex is to 
deny the genuine article when it comes along. But you can't deny Dave Stewart. 
You just can't. 
</P>
<P>
He is 33 years old, earning $3.5 million a year and standing at the top of his 
profession, and he has a conscience the size of his paycheck. He doesn't carry 
on with this altruistic agenda because it looks good in the newspapers or 
because his agent told him it was a good idea. "I've been doing this all my 
life," he said. "Why should I stop now?" 
</P>
<P>
It's true. He worked for the Boys Club in Oakland from age 12 all the way 
through high school -- today he is on the board of directors -- helping keep 
the clubhouses safe and functioning. He kept at it in the off-season after he 
signed a contract with the Dodgers in 1975 and trundled off to the minors. 
"They called me assistant program director back then," he said. "They called 
all the kids that." 
</P>
<P>
After he reached the majors in the early '80s, he would come home to Oakland 
after the season, call elementary schools and offer to come speak about 
education and drugs. The schools didn't call him. He just wanted to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people today feel that athletes are people who forget where 
they come from once they make something of themselves," he said. "I don't know 
if that's true. I hear a lot of fans say it. But I don't claim to speak for the 
whole game. All I know is my parents didn't raise me that way." 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in East Oakland, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. His father 
was a longshoreman who believed in hard work and didn't want Dave to play 
baseball because it had no future. His mother worked at a cannery down the 
block. The temptations of inner-city life were all around, but Stewart did not 
submit. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the chance to grow up and turn into a pretty bad adult," he said, "and I 
didn't. The reason in large part is that I was involved in projects and 
organizations and sports, and around the right people. I received. That's why I 
give now. I received before I gave. To me, if someone gives you a present, it 
doesn't seem right unless you give them something back." 
</P>
<P>
He is able to give much more since his sudden evolution into an All-Star 
pitcher. He had a 30-35 career record and had been released by the Phillies 
when the A's gave him a tryout in the visitors' bullpen at Memorial Stadium in 
May 1986. "(Former Orioles general manager) Hank Peters didn't even come down 
for a free look," he said. Since that day, he has a 75-39 record. 
</P>
<P>
One of the byproducts of his success is that he became sufficiently rich and 
famous to start Kidcorp, a non-profit group that solicits corporate support for 
children's causes. It also operates support programs for teen-age mothers, drug 
education programs and special-education classes, and sponsors four Little 
League teams, two softball teams, a track team, a dance group and a summer 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
Stories of his hands-on work with earthquake victims were widely circulated 
last fall. Now he is lobbying against the return of the Raiders, his lifelong 
favorite football team, to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing (of the Raiders' move) is just all wrong," he said. "The city 
government is talking about cutting out high school sports programs, and we're 
off guaranteeing the Raiders hundreds of millions of dollars. It stinks. The 
priorities are all wrong. We have pressing problems that need to be addressed 
in Oakland, problems that cities all over the country have. We should address 
them."

EAST GERMANY HAS ALREADY TAKEN A BIG TUMBLE IN GYMNASTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MEMPHIS, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since November, when the Berlin Wall fell, it has been expected that the 
dominance of East German sports would also crumble. But few could have expected 
it this soon. 
</P>
<P>
If there can be such a thing as a rout in gymnastics, it happened Saturday. The 
United States women beat the East Germans by five points in a exhibition dual 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
The United States scored 192.75 points to 187.588 for the East Germans. The 
American score wasn't particularly high, but still solid. The East German 
performance, however, was almost embarrassing, especially for its first team. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a young team, with only one senior member," said Dr. Peter Kotzurek, 
who coaches the East German women. "This is a new beginning with a new team." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in 11 years that East Germany has sent a gymnastics team 
to the United States. The team was well received by the crowd of 5,300 at the 
Mid-South Coliseum, who gave them a standing ovation when they marched in 
behind their national flag. 
</P>
<P>
But there was little East Germany did after that to warrant applause. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans outperformed the East Germans in every event, especially the 
uneven bars and beam. The East Germans came closest to the Americans on the 
floor exercise, the final event, but by then were five points behind. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one gymnast left from the team East Germany sent to the 1989 
world championships, Baerbel Wielgoss. The rest have retired. Wielgoss, along 
with Diana Schroeder and Anke Schoenfelder, are the core of the team. But they 
slipped and fell almost as much as their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The United States finished in fourth place at the world championships, one spot 
ahead of the East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the U.S. team had four returning gymnasts from the world 
championships -- Wendy Bruce, Chelle Stack, Kim Kelly and Sandy Woolsey -- who, 
with few exceptions, had solid performances. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce won the all-around with 39.225 points, followed by American Elisabeth 
Crandall at 38.875 and East Germany's Schroeder at 38.475. 
</P>
<P>
But the real standout of this meet was 13-year-old Shannon Miller. The 4-foot-3 
teen-ager from Edmond, Okla., finished seventh, beating Stack, and four East 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could have done better," said Miller, whose routines include 
high-difficulty moves, both on the beam and the floor. 
</P>
<P>
She scored a 9.6 on the vault, a 9.75 on the uneven bars, a 9.20 on the beam 
and a 9.225 on the floor. Falls on the beam and the floor cost her .50. 
</P>
<P>
Miller will be eligible for the 1991 World Championships, although she will be 
only 14, because that meet will be a qualifier for the 1992 Olympics. Normally, 
a gymnast must turn 15 within the year of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The United States showed its dominance early, outscoring East Germany by almost 
a point -- 48.750 to 47.975 -- on the vault. However, the performances on the 
vault were poor, and for the East Germans, it was not because they attempted 
vaults with high difficulty. Schroeder earned the highest score, a 9.75. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't improve for the East Germans. In the next event, the uneven bars, 
Sabine Otte missed the high bar on a Deltchev release move, landing on her 
stomach. The Deltchev -- in which the gymnast takes a giant swing in a straddle 
position, releases the bar and then recatches it behind her -- is a tough, but 
common move among elite athletes. Otte scored an 8.25. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second rotation, the United States was ahead by more than 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
Most figured that the East Germans would make up their losses on the beam, 
where the Americans are usually outscored. Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
The first three East Germans had some kind of fall, either off the beam or on 
the dismount. And in the middle of all this again was Miller, who delighted the 
crowd with two back layouts and an attempt at a difficult dismount -- two back 
flips with a full twist. She fell, but still earned a 9.2. 
</P>
<P>
The hopes of the East Germans fell to Schroeder and Wielgoss. They fell too. 
And with only the floor exercise remaining, the United States led East Germany 
by 4.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany will have another chance today in men's competition.

FROST GOES BACK TO THE OLD STUFF FOR 66 AND LEAD

David Frost went back to his old clubs and got back his old form. 
</P>
<P>
Frost needed only 24 putts Saturday to shoot a six-under-par 66 and take the 
third-round lead in the USF&amp;G tournament at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing ninth in earnings in 1988 and 11th last year, he changed clubs. 
He struggled through the early part of this year and entered this tournament 
No. 68 on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
That was the end of the line for the new clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back to my old clubs three weeks ago," he said. "At Bay Hill, I got off 
the course and gave the clubs away. That poor guy is probably hooking it, now." 
</P>
<P>
Frost began play in a four-way tie, three shots behind second-round leader Gary 
Koch. He started fast, with a birdie on the first hole and an eagle on the 
second, then birdied 11, 13 and 14 on the back nine to finish 54 holes at 
nine-under 207, one stroke in front of Brian Tennyson, who shot a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara and Corey Pavin were next at 209. Curt Byrum and Steve Elkington, 
bidding to become the season's first back-to-back winner, were tied at 211. 
</P>
<P>
Early starter Frank Beard beat the winds and shot a five-under-par 67 to tie 
the Reunion Pro-Am tournament's 36-hole record and take a commanding lead after 
two rounds at Frisco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Beard, playing before blustery winds of up to 24 m.p.h. began sending scores 
soaring, matched Bruce Crampton's 1977 record by playing the first two rounds 
in 11-under-par 133. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Douglass, who teamed with Charles Coody to win the Legends of Golf last 
week, shot a 70 and was a distant second. Senior Tour rookie Bob Wynn, a 
qualifier, and Larry Laoretti were next at 140.

49ERS BEAT UCLA FOR FIRST TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: CAL STATE LONG BEACH GETS AUTOMATIC BID TO NCAA FINAL FOUR. BRUINS 
PROBABLY WILL MAKE TOURNAMENT, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forget that both UCLA and Cal State Long Beach both were virtually assured 
trips to the NCAA Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
The big championship could wait. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins and 49ers apparently decided that a Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn. title was enough to keep their interests. 
</P>
<P>
In the center of the action in Saturday's tournament final at Cal State 
Northridge was Jason Stimfig, Long Beach's spindly 6-foot freshman setter. 
</P>
<P>
Stimfig, a walk-on from Manhattan Beach Mira Costa High, did not play his best 
match of the season. In fact, he struggled so much in the third game that he 
was temporarily replaced. 
</P>
<P>
But he was around when it counted as the top-ranked 49ers rebounded to win 
their first WIVA title, 15-10, 11-15, 3-15, 15-8, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
Stimfig, starting only his second big match of the season, ignited Long Beach 
in the deciding game, which was played on point-per-play, quick-score format. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 5-5, Stimfig put down an over-the-shoulder dunk. On the 
ensuing play, he made a big play at the net with a block for a point. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed it was a tired pass. It was just hanging there, so I hit it," 
Stimfig said of his dunk. "It was a real emotional turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
Stimfig started the season as a redshirt but was activated by Coach Ray Ratelle 
midway through the season. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I looked at him in practice, I just knew he had to play for us," 
Ratelle said. "Of course, I didn't know he'd do what he's been doing." 
</P>
<P>
During the second and third games Saturday, what he did was self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
On more than one occasion, 49er hitters breezed by without attempting a hit due 
to miscommunication on the set. 
</P>
<P>
From the bench, Stimfig calculated an adjustment, then made it work during the 
final two games. 
</P>
<P>
"They were squaring up on our star hitters," Stimfig said. "I had to move it 
around more." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Brent Hilliard led the 49ers with 26 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (27-6) earned the WIVA's automatic bid to the Final Four with the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked UCLA (23-5), the second-place finisher in a conference that has 
delivered all 20 NCAA champions, should advance as a wild-card team. The Final 
Four will be played May 4-5 at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has 13 national championships, but Long Beach will make its first 
appearance since 1973.

TRACK AND FIELD: UCLA EASILY BEATS USC IN PERHAPS THE LAST MEET TO BE HELD AT 
THE COLISEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a time for nostalgia Saturday at the Coliseum, where legendary track 
stars, mainly from USC, were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
The meet between USC and UCLA, however, wasn't as memorable, although there 
were some competitive events. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the UCLA men's team beat USC, 94-68, while the Bruin women won 
easily, 90-40. 
</P>
<P>
Renovations are planned to lower the seating to field level and cover the 
track, which would only be restored for a major event, such as the Olympic 
Games, or the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2,452 were present on a warm day for what was most likely the last dual 
meet at the Coliseum between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The competition has become one-sided with the UCLA men beating USC for the 12th 
consecutive time. The Bruin women haven't lost to USC since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I was apprehensive coming to the Coliseum because we've had some injuries and 
USC had some holes, but I was pleased because there were some real competitive 
events," said Bob Larsen, UCLA's men's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ernie Bullard, USC's coach: "It was a typical USC-UCLA meet. Our kids 
always compete well." 
</P>
<P>
There was also a legends eight-man 800-meter relay, which was won by UCLA in 
the time of 1:32.7. That's some sort of a record considering that no one could 
recall the event ever being run before. 
</P>
<P>
The competitive fires still burn, though, as UCLA anchor man Brian Theriot was 
waving his baton furiously to the crowd as he crossed the finish line 
comfortably ahead of Michael Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy Edwards, the former NCAA sprint champion, seemingly pulled up with a leg 
injury while running the seventh leg for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
However, he literally ran out of his shoes. He said he had grabbed a pair of 
spikes from his trophy case at home and the shoes simply fell apart on him 
while he was sprinting. 
</P>
<P>
There were other highlights from the collegiate portion of the meet: 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC's Quincy Watts, who has been inactive with a strained hamstring and 
other minor injuries, won the 400 meters in 47.02 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA freshmen Robert Mata trailed USC's Dreux Valenti until the last 80 
meters of the 3,000 meter steeplechase and then sprinted past the the Trojan to 
win in 9:16.25. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some football players bolstered the Trojans in the sprints. Cornerback 
Calvin Holmes and tailback Ricky Ervins went 1-2 in the 100. Wide receiver 
Travis Hannah won the 200 and Holmes finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA dominated every field event but the long jump, which was won by USC's 
Dietmar Haaf, the world indoor champion from West Germany at 25-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Brian Blutreich and John Knight had creditable throws of 192-8 and 212-6 
in winning the shotput and hammer throw, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC's George Porter, who has also been inactive since a wart was removed 
from his foot, was in command all the way in winning the 400-meter hurdles in 
50.90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
In women's events, UCLA's Tonya Sedwick, an accomplished competitor in the 
heptathlon, won the 400 in the personal best time of 52.92, the long jump at 
20-7 and ran a leg on UCLA's winning 400-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Janeen Vickers was a double winner, 100 and 400-meter hurdles as was her 
teammate, Tracie Millet in the shotput and discus. 
</P>
<P>
USC's Ashley Selman set a meet record with a throw of 184-10 in the javelin, 
best collegiate mark in the nation this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins were never in danger of losing, men or women, and Sedwick said the 
meet had lost some of its flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Sedwick came to UCLA from Jeffersonville, Ind., primarily as a long jumper and 
didn't particularly care about running. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bob Kersee, the UCLA women's coach, knows a good heptathlete when he 
sees one, since he also coaches his wife, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the Olympic 
heptathlete gold medalist and world record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
Kersee was gratified that his 400-meter relay team got an NCAA qualifying mark 
of 43.83 while winning easily. 
</P>
<P>
It was a meet record performance and now Kersee said he can concentrate on 
qualifying athletes for individual events in the NCAA. The Bruin women have 
finished second the past two years, but they are favored this year. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA won the men's 400-meter relay as USC was disqualified when Calvin Holmes 
ran out of the zone while fumbling the exchange from Travis Hannah. . . . As 
punishment, Ernie Bullard said that USC sprint coach Don Quarrie ordered Holmes 
into the 200 meters. . . . USC's Ashley Selman on the significance of the meet: 
"The meet is hyped up. . . . We're so out-numbered. We have 15 people. They 
have 15 distance runners."

CONNER FIRST TO GET TO ENSENADA; LACK OF WIND LEAVES OTHERS BEHIND

Lack of wind has made a shambles out of the 43rd Newport-to-Ensenada yacht 
race. 
</P>
<P>
As of 6 p.m. Saturday, only 30 boats had finished the 125-mile course, and 72 
more reported that they were abandoning the race. 
</P>
<P>
First to finish at 7:33 a.m. Saturday was the catamaran Stars and Stripes, 
skippered by Dennis Conner of San Diego in an elapsed time of 19 hours 33 
minutes, four hours slower than he finished last year. 
</P>
<P>
The first monohull to finish was the ULDB-70 Taxi Dancer, skippered by Mitchell 
Rouse of the California Yacht Club, which finished at 12:10 p.m. One minute 
behind Taxi Dancer was Roy Disney's ULDB-70 Pyewachet. Six other ULDB-70's 
finished between 12 and 1 p.m.

Winds were light again on Todos Santos Bay, which means a long night for the

MOVE TO BULLPEN HAS BEEN BONUS FOR ECKERSLEY, A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was strictly coincidence that Dennis Eckersley's baseball career and 
lifestyle changed directions at the same time a little more than three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Eckersley nor the Oakland Athletics had a clue that he would become the 
premier reliever in baseball. That happened almost by accident, shortly after 
he was acquired from the Chicago Cubs in the final week of spring training in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of starting pitchers who were missing turns," said A's Manager 
Tony La Russa. "He was a quality veteran and we were looking for depth. We had 
guys like (Joaquin) Andujar, (Moose) Haas, (Greg) Caderet and (Jose) Rijo who 
pitched good when they pitched, but they couldn't always go out there. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of them turned up unavailable, then Eck was going to go into the 
rotation," said La Russa. "But then we ran into the same problem in the 
bullpen, when Jay Howell got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Brilliant decisions sometimes evolve from such circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Unbeknownst to the A's, or the Cubs, was that Eckersley, who had spent some 
time on the wild side, was making changes of his own. Personal problems caused 
him to take inventory of his life after the 1986 season, and he didn't like the 
looks of his balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a screwed-up year," said Eckersley, "but I'm not going to make 
excuses. I just didn't pitch good." 
</P>
<P>
He had had arm problems in 1985 (when he was 11-7), and when he followed with a 
6-11 season, the Cubs figured Eckersley was on the down side of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't blame the Cubs for trading me -- they didn't know the guy they were 
trading was sober," said Eckersley, who went through an alcohol treatment 
program on his own during the off-season. "But it wasn't the time for me to 
talk about it either." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just because Eckersley didn't want to admit to a problem. "I really 
didn't know that much then. As time went on it came out and now it's easy for 
me to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
While looking for a starting pitcher to give them depth, the A's came up with 
an unexpected bonus: a rejuvenated Eckersley. Still neither the right-hander 
nor La Russa envisioned him in the role of stopper. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing for me was accepting what it was," said Eckersley. "At first 
it was a garbage role -- sort of like a caddie. It was a blow to what was left 
of my ego." 
</P>
<P>
That changed with the injury to Howell, who subsequently was traded to the 
Dodgers after the 1987 season. In the last two years Eckersley has saved 78 
games for the A's, a remarkable statistic for a guy who spent his first dozen 
years in the big leagues as a front line starter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a seeming vulnerability to left-handed hitters, the transition 
undoubtedly has given Eckersley a career extension as well as a different 
approach to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm much more physical than I've ever been," he said. "The truth is that my 
arm came back. If that didn't happen, nothing would matter. When your arm is 
bad you work harder on it. If it isn't, you don't do anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Working out is like therapy to me -- plus it's like trying to stop the aging 
process," said Eckersley, who at 35 is in the best shape of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best conditioned athletes around," said La Russa. "He's got a 
program that would bring young guys to their knees." 
</P>
<P>
Years ago the importance of such a program would have been lost on Eckersley, 
but no longer. "I want the game more than ever now," he said. "It would be 
stupid to jeopardize it. And how good a shape do you have to be in to pitch one 
inning a game? And working out is a very positive thing; you expect good things 
to happen when you work hard." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley gives Oriole Manager Frank Robinson credit for getting him to the big 
leagues sooner than expected, and La Russa for enhancing his success as a 
reliever. "Frank played an important role in my career," said Eckersley, who 
came up in 1975 with the Indians, the first team managed by Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's decision on Eckersley 15 years ago was not unlike the one he made on 
Gregg Olson a year ago. "He hadn't done anything wrong and I couldn't see any 
reason to send him down, even though he hadn't pitched above Double A," said 
Robinson. "We started him in the bullpen, but that was to protect him because 
he was only 20 years old. He was in the rotation by the middle of May." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people didn't want me in the big leagues that soon," said Eckersley, 
"but Frank believed in me. I was very fortunate to have him as manager at that 
point in my career. 
</P>
<P>
"And a lot of my success now is due to the manager (La Russa). The way he uses 
me makes it easy." 
</P>
<P>
However, La Russa can't help his ace get out the left-handed hitters that 
occasionally tormented him. "Part of the answer to that is I only have to go 
after them one time," said Eckersley. "There comes a time in your career when 
it gets tough to get a guy out four times (in a game). I probably see as many 
left-handed hitters as right-handed, but I can still throw pretty hard for one 
inning." 
</P>
<P>
And if he didn't always have control of himself, Eckersley always did have good 
control of his pitches. "I'm not talking about this kind of control," said La 
Russa, holding his hands about six inches apart in the middle of an imaginary 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
"His control is like this," La Russa said for emphasis, indicating an area of 
about four inches -- starting two inches from the edge of the plate to two 
inches outside the strike zone. "He has four different pitches with his 
fastball. He throws in, down and in, up and in, down and away, up and away -- 
and they all have different movement." 
</P>
<P>
Though Eckersley admitted to having some nervousness when he took over his new 
role ("Anybody who says they don't get nervous is crazy," he said), pitching 
coach Dave Duncan says it's no accident he has adapted to the role of stopper. 
"He's been out there in the ninth inning as a starter a lot of times," said 
Duncan. "He knows how to get the last out -- and anybody who can do that can be 
a good short reliever." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley had his share of success in the past, but not as much appreciation. 
"I wouldn't want anybody to have to go through what I went through," he said, 
reflecting on his erratic past. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's difficult for anybody to really appreciate success unless they've had 
some problems along the way." 
</P>
<P>
So Dennis Eckersley keeps working out, slowing the aging process and extending 
a career that changed both dramatically and unexpectedly.

In the Frisky family photo, only Mister Frisky is gainfully employed. 
</P>
<P>
Mom is named Frisky Flyer. She started at the bottom and stayed there. After 20 
races, she had earned only $18,955 and was retired for breeding in Florida. 
Since then, all but one of the kids have followed in her hoofprints. 
</P>
<P>
First, she was bred to Fire Dancer, but that worked poorly. No one so much as 
bothered to name that colt. Charming Flyer was only a little better. At least 
he showed up for 24 races, but he managed to earn only $3,715. Miss Frisky 
never earned a dime, and Miss Frisky Lady scraped together $12,658 in the one 
year she raced. 
</P>
<P>
Frisky Flyer was bred to Marsayas twice, in 1985 and '86, which says a good 
deal about the low esteem in which he was held. Marsayas' fee was $1,500 with 
few takers. First, she foaled Miss Frisky Lady, then Mister Frisky, who was 
named for his mother, not, as some believe, after a brand of Puerto Rican cat 
food. Mister Frisky was better-looking than most of his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Had he not been an outstanding physical specimen, despite his small size, he 
would likely have sold for about $2,500 as a yearling, a typical price for a 
Marsayas colt. But Mister Frisky brought a final bid of $15,000 -- big money 
for a Marsayas -- from Puerto Rican interests. At the time, $15,000 was 
probably enough to buy Marsayas himself. 
</P>
<P>
But is the undefeated Mister Frisky genuine -- really? 
</P>
<P>
He is a heroic figure in Puerto Rico, where he won 13 races last year before 
being sent to Miami for the Florida Stallion Stakes, which he missed after 
suffering a minor injury while training at Calder. Since his training was 
assigned to Laz Barrera, a heroic figure in Puerto Rico himself since he won 
the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes with Bold Forbes in 1976, Mister Frisky 
is three for three in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The colt is also on top of most polls of Kentucky Derby contenders, even after 
Summer Squall's very impressive victory Saturday in the Blue Grass Stakes. 
There are many so-called experts, apparently, who like Mister Frisky's chances 
two weeks from Saturday at Churchill Downs. And then there are those convinced 
that when the product of a union between Marsayas and Frisky Flyer who stands 
only 60 inches at the withers is tested for class, he will disintegrate -- the 
dust-to-dust theory. 
</P>
<P>
While Mister Frisky has won 16 races, the 26 other sons and daughters of 
Marsayas have won only 22 among them. Mister Frisky's earnings, $402,625, 
easily surpass the total of all other Marsayas offspring, which is $118,918, 
$29,000 of that earned by the former-best Marsayas, Expert Eyes, who started 49 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Those applying the dust-to-dust theory to Mister Frisky contend he simply is 
genetically incapable of becoming a top-class horse.

FEELING TENSE? YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING YOUR JOB; 
</P>
<P>
STRESS: AS COMPETITION GROWS, SO DO WORKPLACE TENSIONS. FROM BOARDROOM TO SHOP 
FLOOR, EVERYONE FRETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Working harder? Working faster? Feeling tense? Does your job seem less like the 
livelihood you once enjoyed and more like the sure-fire formula for a stomach 
ulcer? 
</P>
<P>
You're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
A broad spectrum of the U.S. work force -- from blue-collar workers to 
corporate chairmen, hospital nurses to flight attendants -- struggles today 
with work that is faster, more tension-packed and, overall, more exhausting 
than it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"There are new pressures in the workplace, and they take a human cost," 
declares Harley Shaiken, a professor of work and technology at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Work and pressure have always kept close company. But lately, certain realities 
have been pounding the lone employee harder than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign competition is an abstract concept -- until the threat of a shutdown 
hovers over your factory. Even for highly paid executives, job security has 
eroded sharply in an era of merger mania. At all levels of the job ladder, 
millions of people struggle with the migraine-inducing balance between work and 
child-rearing. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, job-related stress claims have skyrocketed. And if anything, 
the varied pressures facing workers will increase in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question that this is going on, and it will 
continue, and it's going to accelerate," said Eric G. Flamholtz, a professor of 
management at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. manufacturers, for instance, now race faster than ever to be first 
out with new products, a key to surviving in the increasingly global economy. 
At home, decontrol of airlines and other industries has meant that flight 
attendants now must cater to more passengers per flight and pilots spend more 
hours maneuvering through crowded skies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a job that I don't know if I could start today," said Shirley Barber, an 
Irvine resident who has worked as a United Airlines flight attendant for 19 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s' vogue of carving bloated companies into lean-and-mean corporate 
machines has left a trail of confused, emaciated labor forces in its wake. At 
the top levels, executives struggle as hard as ever for profit gains but with 
less job security than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
And everywhere, it seems, workers scramble to keep up with technology, such as 
computers and facsimile machines, that enables them to finish work and deliver 
it to impatient customers more quickly than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, such pressures aren't all bad. "American industry doggone-right 
better start working harder if it's going to keep up with the rest of the 
world," said James McN. Stancill, a USC professor of finance. 
</P>
<P>
Competition often results in lower prices and faster service. Higher living 
standards depend on productivity gains. And progress needn't always take a 
human toll: Experts agree that the biggest improvements in personal performance 
are attained when people work smarter and not just harder. 
</P>
<P>
Feverish Pace 
</P>
<P>
Only, the ideal of working smart isn't always met. The pressures to produce 
have transformed the climate of work in many places, creating "a feverish pace 
that seems to have emerged in the last three to five years," said Edward 
Sanford, chairman of Pepperdine University's economics, marketing and 
quantitative methods department. The stress level in business, he added, "is 
making life very obnoxious." 
</P>
<P>
At Cache Computers in the San Francisco Bay Area, the key to survival is 
rushing high-tech products to market faster than rivals in Asia and the United 
States. For employees, that often means 12-hour days as well as strict 
deadlines imposed on subcontractors: The performance of suppliers can make a 
crucial difference in a product's profit. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping up in the fast-paced world "is a little like trying to shoot ducks -- 
and they're coming off the pond quicker, one after the other," observed Bill 
Fenley, vice president of sales and marketing at the Fremont firm. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he's complaining. "We're all working harder, but at the same time, 
there's the thrill of victory when you know you've done a good job," Fenley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled competition is not all caused by the global economy. For many 
industries, operating inside the United States has gotten tougher. The 
deregulation movement, for instance, has subjected such once-stable industries 
as airlines, trucking, buses and telephone service to the jolt of new 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Employees feel it: For long-haul truckers, keeping to schedule has taken on new 
urgency. And airline employees -- once the beneficiaries of predictable, secure 
employment -- have gradually been squeezed harder by employers. 
</P>
<P>
Consider flight attendants. At the time of 1978 airline deregulation, United 
Airlines' DC-10s were equipped with 242 seats and employed up to 10 flight 
attendants per flight. Since then, United and its rivals have packed more and 
more seats into their jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it's not unusual for eight flight attendants to handle a United DC-10 
with 287 seats. And that adds up to more bending, reaching, walking, stowing 
suitcases and other chores for a typical flight. 
</P>
<P>
"I deliver a lot more things to a lot more people than I did before 
deregulation," Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
Cost Cutting 
</P>
<P>
In the quest to cut costs, industries have tried various strategies. Typically, 
more is expected of employees. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals, for instance, have tried to combat health-care inflation by 
admitting only the truly sick for overnight stays. For nurses, this means a 
sharp rise in intravenous medications, dressing changes, careful monitoring and 
other sorts of care required by the acutely ill; virtually all patients are in 
serious shape. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, by contrast, perhaps only two patients out of 10 were that 
sick, said Kay Davis, a nurse and health-care consultant in Los Angeles. 
"You're looking at a drastic difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In other fields, new technologies have had the effect of an electronic poke in 
the shoulder to workers who once could take a bit more time. Take facsimile 
machines, which enable documents to be transmitted almost at once. While 
enormously convenient, the technology also can put new pressure on employees to 
finish work sooner than before. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, clients would say, 'Give it to me in two days,' " said Michael 
Waldorf, a legal search consultant in Los Angeles. "Then there was Federal 
Express and overnight mail. Now people want it to be faxed. There's just a much 
faster pace." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, technology serves as an all-knowing work monitor, toting up the 
number of keystrokes and corrections made by word processors, allowing 
supervisors to eavesdrop on telephone calls, even watching over the workplace 
and cafeteria with video cameras, according to a recent report by 9to5, the 
National Assn. of Working Women. 
</P>
<P>
"Electronic snooping causes fear and stress, which leads to illness" rather 
than increased productivity, complains Karen Nussbaum, director of the 
Cleveland-based group, estimating that 10 million American workers now are 
subject to some form of electronic surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Leaner Staffing 
</P>
<P>
A key change affecting corporate America in the 1990s is the reality of thinner 
work ranks in many places, a legacy of the cost-cutting and restructuring fever 
of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, about 4.5 million Americans at all levels of the career ladder have 
lost their jobs because of restructuring, said Jerome M. Rosow, president of 
the Work in America Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Scarsdale, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
When the surgery is performed inartfully, say critics, employees pay the price. 
In their efforts to hop on the cost-cutting bandwagon, employers have been 
known to cut the wrong areas or fail to tell the remaining employees how they 
should absorb an increased work burden. 
</P>
<P>
Shyam H. Gidumal, a vice president of the Boston Consulting Group in Los 
Angeles, recalled one case where a firm unwisely cut back its sales staff as 
much as its accounting staff, saddling its embattled sales force with an 
impossible load. "What's happening is their customers aren't getting called 
on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, there's nothing so unusual about today's pressures. Work is tough, 
after all, and a nation's gains in prosperity require major effort. The 
relatively worry-free period of U.S. economic dominance after World War II was 
far more peculiar than today's climate, at least by historical standards. 
</P>
<P>
For many younger Americans, these hard realities have yet to sink in. "I think 
we're not yet working as hard as our parents and grandparents worked -- or the 
foreign competition," said Philip H. Birnbaum-More, 46, a professor of 
management at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in some ways, workers today face forms of pressure that are quite 
different from the problems their grandparents contended with. More single 
parents than ever are attempting to balance the demands of work and family, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Moonlighting 
</P>
<P>
Young mothers commonly try to hold on to jobs outside the home. Indeed, at a 
time when pay raises often lag inflation, moonlighting by women has reached 
record-setting rates, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. By the 
middle of last year, 5.9% of American women held two jobs -- a five-fold 
increase since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never been that high," said Audrey Freedman, an economist with the 
Conference Board, a business research organization in New York. "When the 
number first came through, the BLS thought there was some error, it was so 
high." 
</P>
<P>
In today's transient society, harried parents scrambling to balance work and 
family demands often live far away from relatives who might lend a helping 
hand. The problem seems especially acute in California, where many people have 
close relatives in other parts of the country, said Bryan Lawton, a clinical 
psychologist who counsels employees at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, he said, workers feel like they have "too much to do and too little 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Mental stress claims against employers skyrocketed more than 500% in the 1980s 
in California and now cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually, according 
to the California Workers' Compensation Institute. And although the state is 
more liberal in allowing such claims than most, workplace stress seems to have 
gone up everywhere, said Paul J. Rosch, president of the American Institute of 
Stress in Yonkers, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In a March survey commissioned by Revlon Inc., 36% of respondents cited their 
work situations as the largest cause of personal stress, more than any other 
cause. "Most Americans quite clearly perceive they are under more stress than 
they were five years ago -- and job stress is No. 1 on the list," Rosch said. 
</P>
<P>
Executives 
</P>
<P>
The discomfort isn't limited to those toiling at the lower rungs of the job 
ladder. Years of merger mania have eroded the security of executives who know 
they may be dumped if a takeover occurs. By some gauges, top executives seem 
more willing than ever to bail out of the corporate race. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1979, 17.3% of 1,708 top-level managers polled by Korn/Ferry 
International, a major executive search firm, said they expected to work as 
long as possible before retiring. But the gung-ho group is shrinking. Asked the 
same question last year, only 9.6% of 750 executives polled expected to work as 
long as they could. 
</P>
<P>
"The destiny of the individual at the senior level is more in jeopardy than it 
has ever been -- and it has little to do with how good a job he's doing," said 
Robert S. Rollo, Korn/Ferry's managing director. 
</P>
<P>
There may be no easy solution for some of the anxieties that employees face 
today, such as merger fears or the stress of juggling work and family. But 
certain things can be done to ease the pain, according to workplace experts. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo, Kaiser Permanente, Transamerica Life and many other companies now 
offer harried employees either counseling or other programs designed to help 
allay workplace stress. According to the American Institute of Stress, one firm 
reduced its annual workers' compensation claims to $93,000 from $272,000 with 
the aid of a program that made use of meditation, biofeedback and muscle 
relaxation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
In light of such financial realities, the California Workers' Compensation 
Institute advises employers to identify -- and eliminate -- the causes of 
workplace stress. Among the worst: insensitive managers, unrealistic deadlines, 
insufficient training and failure to give workers the chance to share their 
views, a situation that leads to a sense of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can spot the factors that lead to stress and deal with them, you're 
better off than trying to manage it after it happens," counsels Michael W. 
Jones, assistant general manager with the San Francisco-based organization.

USX AND ICAHN BUTT IRON WILLS IN PROXY FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
STEEL: THE FAMOUS RAIDER'S STATED GOAL IS TO RECREATE U.S. STEEL. BUT HIS REAL 
INTENTIONS ARE THE SUBJECT OF SPECULATION. 
</P>

<P>
What does Carl Icahn really want? 
</P>
<P>
Is the man who was once among Wall Street's most feared corporate raiders -- 
and who now finds his old tactics unfashionable -- really just interested in 
raising the long-depressed price of his USX Corp. stock? In other words, has he 
joined the kinder, gentler 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
Or is his proxy fight against USX an effort to put the nation's largest 
steelmaker -- also one of America's biggest energy concerns -- into play? 
</P>
<P>
Icahn's motives in what will likely be one of this spring's hottest proxy 
fights came under intense scrutiny last week when he issued divergent 
statements about his intentions for Pittsburgh-based USX. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn is USX's largest shareholder, with a 13.3% stake. On Wednesday, he 
announced plans to acquire an additional $800 million in USX securities if his 
proposal to split USX into two distinct companies -- one for energy and another 
for steel -- is approved by shareholders at the firm's annual meeting May 7 in 
Findlay, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Yet later the same day, Icahn was quoted as expressing a willingness to acquire 
all of USX for $48 per share, or $10.7 billion, as long as management agrees to 
a friendly takeover -- a condition that Icahn himself conceded is highly 
unlikely, given his poor relations with USX management. 
</P>
<P>
"If the spinoff is approved, I am definitely a buyer of USX stock up to $48 per 
share," Icahn said, referring to the combined value he places on the shares of 
the two proposed companies. Icahn said he would mount a tender offer at prices 
of up to $48 per share because he believes that the oil-steel spinoff would 
sharply boost the stock from its current trading range in the low $30s. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn associates were apparently caught off guard by his ambitious statements 
about buying all of USX, and insisted that they were only committed to the 
additional $800-million investment. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn's latest gambit drew an immediate response from USX Chairman Charles A. 
Corry, who has spent much of his time out on the investment hustings in recent 
weeks, urging large institutional holders of USX to vote with management. 
</P>
<P>
"USX shareholders should not be misled," Corry said. "Icahn has not offered to 
buy any shares of USX stock at $48 per share or at any other price." 
</P>
<P>
Corry contends that Icahn's proposal to split USX would weaken the company's 
steel operations, add $115 million in new costs and deprive steel of the 
much-needed "credit umbrella" provided by USX's big oil-and-gas unit, 
ultimately hurting shareholders. Corry said Icahn's stock-buying program 
"sounded like a ploy." 
</P>
<P>
But Icahn argues that USX shareholders have little to lose. His spinoff 
proposal calls for USX shareholders to receive a stock dividend worth between 
80% and 100% of the value of the company's steel assets, which would then be 
formed into a new "old" company -- U.S. Steel. Ironically, a 1980s-style raider 
would thus be reviving one of the most time-honored names in corporate America 
and, in a sense, taking the company back to its gritty roots. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the surviving USX would be left with its Marathon Oil unit and what 
would remain of its Texas Oil &amp; Gas subsidiary after the pending sale of 
the latter's oil and gas reserves. Icahn argues, in effect, that the parts are 
greater than the sum of USX. He says USX's energy-company stock would be worth 
$39 per share, while USX's steel business -- now the most efficient steelmaker 
in the country -- could fetch $9 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Splitting the oil and steel operations into stand-alone entities would, he 
says, increase their marketability because Wall Street analysts who follow 
specific industries would pay closer attention to the two companies than they 
do to USX as a hybrid conglomerate. And shareholders who want to buy into the 
oil business would no longer back away from USX because of its big stake in the 
highly cyclical steel sector. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1970s-style conglomerate is a dinosaur," said Alfred Kingsley, vice 
chairman of Icahn's Transworld Airlines and his right-hand man in the USX proxy 
fight. "And the lack of analyst coverage matters; it means the stock doesn't 
get much attention." 
</P>
<P>
Kingsley also says Icahn, who has owned USX shares since 1986, has waited long 
enough to see if management could boost the stock's value. Excluding dividends, 
Kingsley says, the company's stock is worth almost exactly the same today as in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
"In nearly 30 years of purchasing undervalued companies," Icahn said last week, 
he has "not seen a more undervalued situation than USX." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Icahn went out of his way to insist that he isn't interested in gaining 
control of USX. He pledged not to try a takeover if management would agree not 
to take steps to prevent him from raising his stake. 
</P>
<P>
Yet management remains suspicious. USX Vice Chairman Bruce Thomas, who is also 
the firm's chief financial officer, said in an interview last week that it 
"defies reason" to think that Icahn's breakup plan will automatically increase 
the value of the shares and create two healthy companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been able to figure out why he thinks it's good for him," Thomas 
added. "He thinks two pieces of paper would sell for more than one. It doesn't 
make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also warn that USX's steel operations, which only recently recovered 
from the industry's devastating crisis of the 1980s, would likely fare better 
as part of a larger company. 
</P>
<P>
"They are doing well in steel now," said Father William Hogan, an industrial 
economist and steel specialist at Fordham University. "USX is highly efficient, 
with some of the lowest costs in the industry. (The steel operation) could go 
it alone. But the question is, would it be better off? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does the United Steelworkers, the union representing USX's 18,000 
steelworkers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Icahn proposal would represent, in our view, another erroneous step away 
from USX's traditional corporate purpose," one that could "materially affect 
the strength of the steel business," a group of local union leaders said in a 
statement released by the union last week. 
</P>
<P>
But even Icahn's critics agree that USX is in a much better position to spin 
off steel -- once a dream of former USX Chairman David Roderick -- than at any 
other time in the past decade. Under Roderick, USX acquired Marathon in 1982 in 
an effort to reduce the company's dependence on steel. He used oil as a 
financial buffer when he imposed drastic cost-cutting measures and withstood a 
six-month strike at the steel unit. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, the company closed many of its aging mills in Pennsylvania, 
sold a half interest in one of its Ohio mills to a Japanese steelmaker in order 
to create a new joint venture and spent about $3.5 billion on new technology. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Corry took over in 1989, the company's cost of making steel had 
plunged, making USX competitive worldwide. The company was even exporting steel 
to Japan. As a result, the steel unit posted operating earnings of $430 million 
last year, complementing the energy sector's pre-tax profits of $987 million. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about the largest steel producer in the nation, and the most 
efficient," Kingsley said. "If Bethlehem Steel can make it on its own just in 
the steel business, than so can U.S. Steel." 
</P>
<P>
It's still not clear where USX's shareholders will come down in this debate. 
Both camps have wooed investors with mailings and targeted managers of large 
funds through visits and phone calls. Yet most big USX shareholders still seem 
to be on the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"We will wait until the last possible moment to make a decision," said a 
spokesman for one big investor, the New York State Employees Pension Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsley seems confident that many of the institutions will side with Icahn, 
especially since the spinoff proposal is not binding on USX management. Indeed, 
many may support the proposal if only to force USX's board to propose another 
way of boosting the stock's price. The board has a majority of outside 
directors who may be wary of opposing the will of the shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kingsley: "What have they (shareholders) got to lose?"

STATE S&amp;L REGULATORY STAFF SHORTAGE CONTRIBUTED TO CRISIS, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN, BRADLEY INMAN is an Oakland writer specializing in California 
business issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report by the Assembly Office of Research sheds new light on California's 
botched regulatory role in the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a record number of new thrifts were chartered by the California 
savings and loan commissioner. At the time, state-chartered savings and loans 
were being touted as "money-making machines" for real estate developers, 
according to the 45-page report, "Mortgaging the Thrift Industry." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, the number of regulatory personnel in the 
commissioner's office was at its lowest level of the decade -- only 42 
positions in April of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
True, staff slots nearly tripled in the ensuing four years as the thrift crisis 
began to unfold. But S&amp;L growth far outstripped regulatory growth, and by 
then it was too late. Indeed, from 1984 to 1988, "the ratio of professional 
staff per $1 billion in state S&amp;L assets" actually fell more than 30% while 
the number of troubled institutions exploded. 
</P>
<P>
The report blames this mismatch in staffing on the Legislature. By law, the 
state Department of Savings and Loan is supported by fees from the institutions 
it regulates. "As the number of state S&amp;Ls decrease, so do fee collections 
and, therefore, the funding for the department's budget," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, wild fluctuations in the industry's performance in the past 
decade have badly undermined the department's ability to maintain a steady team 
of professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The problem persists. The commissioner's office now faces a heavy workload 
overseeing troubled thrifts, but it is being forced to cut staff 30% because 
the total number of S&amp;Ls has declined, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
"Very soon, all we are going to be left with is a skeleton crew of supervisors 
who are waiting for retirement," said Commissioner William J. Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forecast Will Set Stage for Budget Wrangling 
</P>
<P>
For economists, length of service is a measure of success; forecasters can only 
be wrong so often before they get the boot. 
</P>
<P>
By that standard, the Department of Finance's chief economist, Pauline Sweezey, 
has done well. The 53-year-old Stanford-trained economist has been crunching 
and forecasting the state's economic data for a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, she will help piece together the most important projection of the 
year: the May revision of her 1990 economic forecast. Her projections for 
personal income will set the tone for the state's $40-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-year adjustments to economic forecasts don't get the attention of January 
projections, when a gaggle of public and private economic gurus line up to 
predict the economy's performance for the coming year. But behind the scenes in 
the Sacramento budget-wrangling process, these springtime modifications are 
much more important. 
</P>
<P>
On guard for volatility in projections made earlier in the year, the 
Legislature is putting off the most costly budget choices until reliable 
estimates of total tax receipts are more precise. And tax receipt estimates 
depend on personal income projections, which is where Sweezey comes in. 
</P>
<P>
"A small swing in the forecast can mean a huge amount of money," said Tim Gage, 
a consultant to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, an overly optimistic income estimate required an $875-million 
downward adjustment in projected state revenue, said Gage. 
</P>
<P>
Sweezey's personal income figure is only one ingredient in the overall revenue 
forecast. And she's not infallible. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, she goofed when she -- and most other economists -- 
underestimated the depth of the recession and the ravages of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1988, she strayed from the pack of forecasters who were predicting a 
recession. Sweezey predicted modest growth. As it turned out, her only mistake 
was not being more bullish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Trade Offices Extending Their Reach 
</P>
<P>
If the number of proposals for foreign trade offices is any indication, the 
California Legislature has been touched by the spirit of internationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) wants a foreign trade 
office in Canada. State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) is arguing for a 
state-sponsored outpost in the Philippines, and Assemblyman John Vasconcellos 
(D-Santa Clara) is proposing that California expand its global reach to Eastern 
Europe with a new office in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp also jumped on the foreign trade bandwagon with a 
proposal for a new office somewhere in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
California began opening foreign trade offices in 1987 with one in Tokyo; a few 
months later, another was established in London. In 1989, Mexico City and 
Frankfurt were added, and this year San Francisco businessman Landy Eng was 
dispatched to Hong Kong to open the Southeast Asian Office of Trade and 
Investment. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office, which decides where trade offices are based, has mixed 
feelings about legislative proposals to establish new locations. 
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful for the Legislature's interest in expanding our reach overseas," 
said James Robinson, Gov. George Deukmejian's trade representative. "But 
foreign trade offices aren't intended to be political symbols or 
quasi-embassies for foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson sees the state's $2- million investment in foreign trade strictly as a 
deal-brokering role that benefits California business interests. "We are 
middlemen for California traders and we go where they can and want to do 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There also are practical drawbacks to where trade offices are located, 
according to Jim Phillips, managing partner of California's European Trade and 
Investment Office in London. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be situated in a central hub where we can communicate with various 
countries," said Phillips, who is traveling in Budapest this week on a trade 
mission to Eastern Europe. For example, he said, "the communication is lousy 
from Hungary to Czechoslovakia." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said putting a trade office in Canada makes sense and he expects the 
governor to take action on one in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that, we have no plans," he said.

BUSINESS SPIES FLOURISH, ALLEGEDLY WITH ETHICS;

ESPIONAGE: NOWADAYS THEY'RE 'COMPETITOR INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS,' AND THEY 
CLAIM TO WORK ABOVE BOARD. MANY HAVE GRADUATE DEGREES.

<P>
Corporate spies these days say they've come a long way from Mata Hari and 
midnight break-ins to swipe a competitor's secrets. Now it helps to have an 
advanced degree and the know-how to sniff out information with a computer. 
</P>
<P>
Jan P. Herring, a CIA analyst for 20 years until 1983, is part of the new breed 
of corporate spies who have banded together to form the Society of Competitor 
Intelligence Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly a profession whose time has come," Herring said Thursday at the 
4-year-old, 1,400-member society's annual meeting. "What has caused it to 
happen is competition, particularly among American companies that for the first 
time are experiencing both international and corporate competition." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as a few years ago, most American corporations were satisfied to 
concentrate on researching their own markets and customers. But many are now 
finding that knowing the competition thoroughly can help a company capitalize 
on its own strengths, shore up weaknesses, exploit opportunities and counter 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, corporate spying is an old custom. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are the professionals," Herring said. "They're the ones who 
started it. They do it almost as second nature. It's just part of their 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Margulies, competitive assessment manager for McDonnell Douglas Corp. in 
Long Beach and new president of the society, said the Japanese "have honed 
their techniques for gathering and analyzing information to the point where 
they play it like an instrument, like a professional musician." 
</P>
<P>
Margulies insisted that corporate spying, unlike industrial espionage, is an 
honorable trade with a written code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate spies don't try to ferret out confidential information or bug 
meetings in their rivals' offices. Rather, they rely on public information and 
interviews with experts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not glamorous work," said Margulies. "It is pure, unadulterated 
research: collecting data, interpreting that data and communicating to your 
management or customer." 
</P>
<P>
The information explosion of the past decade, fueled by more powerful computers 
and a proliferation of data banks and specialized publications, helps corporate 
spies find out almost anything they want about competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be very foolish to accept inside, confidential information," Margulies 
said. "It's unethical, and it's illegal to use that information to gain 
competitive advantage. It not only puts you in jeopardy, it puts your company 
in jeopardy and puts your profession in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-five percent of what you need is readily accessible. That additional 5% 
that you can't get legally is not going to help you that much. So why throw 
your career down the drain?" 
</P>
<P>
Competitor-intelligence professionals need the skills of detectives, reporters 
and writers. They travel, if necessary, to competitors' product introductions 
and hobnob with analysts and clients. 
</P>
<P>
"A good intelligence analyst . . . pulls together the pieces of the puzzle," 
said Herring. "You'll never get all the pieces. You may sometimes get 70%." 
</P>
<P>
Herring is vice president of Futures Group in Glastonbury, Conn., a consulting 
company that helps corporations develop and operate their own intelligence 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Many companies have started these things and they've died because they haven't 
done it well or to the extent that it was able to make a difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of universities, including Michigan State, Pittsburgh, Boston, 
Stanford and Harvard, offer courses in competitor intelligence, and none in the 
United States offers a degree in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is a burgeoning profession with opportunities for young people. 
</P>
<P>
Margulies estimated that more than 10,000 people work in competitor 
intelligence for hundreds of companies, many of them in marketing or financial 
departments. Starting salaries for those with degrees and a few years of 
business experience are at least $30,000, he said, with the opportunity of 
making much more as they rise in the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
A study by John E. Prescott and Craig Fleisher of the University of Pittsburgh 
shows that 59% of the Society of Competitor Intelligence Professionals members 
have master's degrees, 29% have bachelor's degrees and 6% have doctorates. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of them earn more than $50,000 a year, and most work for 
companies with more than $1 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Porter, an industry expert at Harvard, has said that managers should 
spend a tour of duty in competitor intelligence in order to better understand 
the competition and how to find out about it. 
</P>
<P>
Margulies said his own work helped McDonnell Douglas avoid a very expensive 
mistake early in the 1980s when the airplane industry was worried about 
skyrocketing jet fuel prices in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Rival Boeing Co. in Seattle had launched an extensive effort within the airline 
industry to see if there was a market for a fuel-efficient plane combining the 
advantages of propellers and jet engines, Margulies said. 
</P>
<P>
Margulies said Boeing found the industry unwilling to commit to ordering the 
expensive planes, and that his reading of this finding led McDonnell Douglas to 
halt its own similar project. 
</P>
<P>
"In our business, when you launch a new design, they're so expensive that 
you're really betting the farm," he said. "So if you make a mistake, you don't 
have a second chance."

ROGER SIMON: BEING PALE: FATE WORSE THAN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I am standing here in Phoenix at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and the temperature 
is hovering right around the melting point of copper. 
</P>
<P>
I know this because the pennies in my pocket are beginning to fuse. The heat 
waves are shimmering up from the sidewalk and it is difficult to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
But as I raise my hand to block the relentless sun, I see a sign through my 
fingers: It is for a tanning salon. 
</P>
<P>
I begin to laugh. A tanning salon? In Phoenix? Where the sun shines 300 days a 
year -- and when I say shines, I mean char-broils? 
</P>
<P>
When I get back to my hotel room I look in the Yellow Pages. I find 20 tanning 
salons in the greater Phoenix area (cutest name: "Brown Bunns" on Shea 
Boulevard). This is very unfortunate but completely understandable. I have 
written about this phenomenon before: It is a uniquely American right. The 
right to be goofy. 
</P>
<P>
"Buckle my seat belt? No way. It's my head and I got a right to have it go 
through the windshield if I want." 
</P>
<P>
"Wear a helmet on a motorcycle? Not a chance! I got a right to become a 
vegetable." 
</P>
<P>
"Stop getting suntans? Hey, it's my skin and I got a right to get cancer." 
</P>
<P>
And we do. There are 500,000 new cases of skin cancer each year in the United 
States. One thing that causes skin cancer is tanning. Skin cancer is the most 
common form of cancer. It is also one of the most curable forms. Even the worst 
type, malignant melanoma, is curable if you catch it in time. 
</P>
<P>
But 23% of the people who develop it die because it has spread too far for 
effective treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Melanoma skin cancer will strike 27,600 Americans this year and kill 5,300 of 
them. The number of cases of malignant melanoma is doubling each decade. 
</P>
<P>
I know all these facts. And I mull them over as I head out to the pool for a 
tan. This makes no sense. This is my right to be goofy. 
</P>
<P>
But at least I know why I am being goofy. I know why people get tans. It makes 
them look good. And they get compliments and this makes them feel good. 
</P>
<P>
I look beautiful this week. More beautiful than usual, that is. I have a golden 
tan. I shouldn't, but I do. I try to be sensible: I always use a sunscreen. I 
never stay out more than an hour a day. I try to avoid the most dangerous 
hours, around noon. 
</P>
<P>
But I know I would be better off looking pale like the belly of a fish. I can't 
seem to resist a tan, however. 
</P>
<P>
The people who run tanning salons know this. They know about customers they 
call "tanorexics." These are people with dark tans who keep coming back to get 
even tanner. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 20,000 tanning parlors in the United States, up from 5,000 in 
1986. Every day more than 1 million Americans use them, and annual retail sales 
are about at $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
This is more than goofy. This is nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some claims, there is no "safe" kind of suntanning. You can ask 
Kelly Salvey, a 21-year-old New Yorker. In 1989 she used a tanning machine in a 
health club for 60 minutes. She used it that long because after the first 40 
minutes, she saw no results. 
</P>
<P>
But within two hours of returning home, she had plenty of results: Her skin 
turned purple, she had trouble breathing, she dehydrated. She had received six 
times the recommended dosage of ultraviolet radiation and had second- and 
third-degree burns. She spent four days in a hospital and today she has 
permanent scars on her face. 
</P>
<P>
All she wanted to do was look good. 
</P>
<P>
Even in sunny cities where people get plenty tanned just walking around, 
tanning parlors flourish. People aren't satisfied getting tanned in the 
daytime. They want to be able to get a tan at night, too. 
</P>
<P>
You want to know how crazy this gets? This is one of the craziest stories I 
have read in years. It was carried by the Associated Press last week: 
</P>
<P>
"A study of more than 1,000 people who had skin-cancer surgery found that 
nearly half continued to stay in the sun in the belief that cancer 'was not 
enough of a problem to give up a tan.' 
</P>
<P>
"The study, published in the April issue of the American Medical Assn.'s 
Archives of Dermatology, found that 44% had not changed their outdoor 
activities one year after removal of their cancers, despite repeated warnings 
by their doctors." In addition, 38% still weren't using sunscreens. 
</P>
<P>
Now think about this. You get cancer. You have it removed by a doctor. And then 
you go back out to get a suntan. Why? 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of these non-compliant individuals, who were usually women, was 
that skin cancer was not enough of a problem to give up a tan," said the 
study's author, Dr. June K. Robinson, a dermatologist at Northwestern 
University Medical School in Chicago. A tan made these people "feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Which is just plain goofy. And if we wanted to help each other out, we would 
never compliment a friend's tan. 
</P>
<P>
Instead we would say: "You look like cooked meat, you jerk! Don't you know 
enough to come in out of the sun?" 
</P>
<P>
I have been telling this to myself every time I look in the mirror this week. 
</P>
<P>
I just wish I didn't look so darned good.

ARCHITECTURE: ONCE GRAND, CINEMAS NOW FOCUS ON FUNCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when movie theaters were splendid palaces, grand fantasias 
conjuring visions of ancient Egypt or China or Aztec Mexico or Moorish Granada. 
</P>
<P>
Architect S. Charles Lee, in the 1931 Los Angeles Theater on Broadway, created 
a dream version of the Palace of Versailles, complete with a tiered lobby 
fountain dripping strings of crystal mock water into a mosaic basin guarded by 
white marble sea serpents. The ornate darkness of the 2,000-seat auditorium 
resounded with the throb of a giant Wurlitzer, which in veteran organist 
Gaylord Carter's phrase, "perfumed the air with music." 
</P>
<P>
But that was then; this is now. 
</P>
<P>
And now cinema architecture tends towards the utilitarian, as if watching a 
movie in an auditorium offers no more sense of occasion than viewing a cassette 
on a home videocassette recorder. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have multiplexes, clusters of small auditoriums, such as the recently 
opened AMC Santa Monica Seven on the Third Street Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
A prosaic box, finished in the fashionable Post-Modern mini-mall colors of 
peach and bluish-green teal, the Santa Monica Seven divides its total 2,500 
audience capacity among seven cinemas ranging in size from 200 to 465 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Hemet-based architects Salts Troutman Kaneshiro Inc., the Santa 
Monica Seven's main aim is, says partner Kevin Troutman, "to be compatible with 
the traditional aesthetic of the pedestrian mall's Neo-Classical and Art Deco 
architecture." 
</P>
<P>
To achieve this compatibility, Troutman chose to design a facade that is almost 
anonymous. A wide, recessed archway housing the ticket booth is the Seven's one 
gesture toward grandness, in a plain stucco promenade frontage. 
</P>
<P>
A narrow, soft drink bar with outdoor tables, titled Critic's Corner Cafe, 
occupies the intersection with Arizona Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Seven's stripped simplicity continues in the lobbies of the 
three-story multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
The theater lobbies are little more than corridors lined with the inevitable 
counters, serving the the appetites of a legion of munching popcornoids. 
</P>
<P>
On the Arizona Street facade, a tall window lets light into the space occupied 
by a series of escalators to carry patrons up to the second floor or down into 
the basement-level cinemas. 
</P>
<P>
The auditoriums seem spacious for their modest sizes. Comfortable seats, fitted 
with AMC's trademark built-in cup holders, are upholstered to match the aisle 
carpets. Completing the simple scenario are plain peach walls, black-painted 
ceilings and red concrete floors designed for the easy cleaning of spilled 
popcorn and soft drink slop. 
</P>
<P>
The luxuries of advanced technologies mitigate some of the architectural 
bareness of the multiplex auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
The ample cinema screens are curved vertically and horizontally to "provide 
enhanced image clarity, a brighter picture and even illumination," said AMC 
regional director Sam Giordano. The visual quality is backed by a High Impact 
Theatre System that provides crisp sound. 
</P>
<P>
"The design intends to generate a lively, fresh and light atmosphere in which 
the experience of watching the movie is paramount," Troutman explained. "AMC 
operates within tight building budgets in an architectural formula that is 
carefully considered." 
</P>
<P>
The AMC architectural formula has proven successful in several local 
multiplexes, including Burbank's AMC 10 and Century City's Century 14. 
</P>
<P>
In Burbank, AMC followed the inspiration of the local Golden Mall by creating a 
giant box that looks like a suburban shopping plaza filled with small cinemas. 
Clad in rough, gray, concrete block, capped with red-metal edging and isolated 
in a sea of parking Tarmac, the AMC 10 is a bare bones building as minimal as 
its surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The Century 14 complex is, for AMC, an upscale design. Here the lobbies are 
more spacious, the finishes a trifle glitzier, the shopping mall ambience muted 
to match the sensibilities of a supposedly more sophisticated Westside 
clientele. 
</P>
<P>
The relative design sophistication of AMC's Century 14 is matched by the 
Universal City complex of its major rival, the Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon. 
With 5,940 seats in 18 auditoriums, Cineplex Odeon's Universal City aimed "to 
bring majesty back into the viewing of movies," said then chairman Garth 
Drabinsky when the multiplex was opened in 1987. "If the setting in which you 
actually see a film turns out to be a let-down," Drabinsky added, "the whole 
complicated enterprise has failed." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that the grandeur of the lobby plays a main role in creating a 
sense of cinematic majesty, Drabinsky lavished marble floors and grand curving 
stairways in a double-height volume flanked by an illuminated garden. The 
ubiquitous concession counters, whose pungent popcorn odors grab you 
immediately upon entry to the AMC multiplexes, are discreetly relegated to the 
side areas close to the auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City-based American Multi-Cinema Entertainment Inc., which claims to 
have invented the multiple-cinema concept in its hometown back in 1963, 
operates close to 1,500 screens in 270 sites nationwide. Cineplex Odeon, AMC's 
main multiplex competitor, runs an even larger number of outlets in the U.S. 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon first revolutionized Toronto's theater-going experience in the 
late 1970s by converting the ground floor of an office building into a series 
of matchbox-sized auditoriums showing small-scale movies, many of them foreign 
art films whose potential audiences were as limited as the size of the Cineplex 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Beverly Center multiplex, Cineplex Odeon's first major Los Angeles 
multiple cinema complex, the Toronto auditoriums were crude little chambers 
with uncomfortable seats and fuzzy projection no better than that of a home 
projection TV. 
</P>
<P>
But Cineplex Odeon proved capable of better things. 
</P>
<P>
In its conversion of two 1930s L.A. movie houses, the Fairfax on Beverly 
Boulevard and the Showcase -- previously the Gordon Theater -- on La Brea 
Avenue, Drabinsky's in-house architects honored the Art Deco flavor of the 
decor while renovating the spaces and updating the technologies. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway, a new Cineplex Odeon two blocks south of the Santa Monica Seven 
on the Third Street Promenade, continues this conscientious pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Toronto architect David K. Mesbur in collaboration with Santa 
Monica-based Solberg &amp; Lowe Architects, the Broadway's Art Deco frontage is 
skillfully integrated into the new Janss Court mixed-use office and condominium 
complex that surrounds it. The sleek 1930s style, which seems so apt for 
movie-going, still pervades the lobby and auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway and the Santa Monica Seven will soon be joined by another 
multiplex on the Third Street Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
Mann Theater's Criterion, a 1,500-seat six-cinema complex designed by Jeff 
Cooper Architects in the renovated shell of a 1920s shop and office building, 
is under construction across the Promenade from AMC's Seven. 
</P>
<P>
When the Criterion opens later this year, the Promenade will offer the public 
about 5,000 new cinema seats. 
</P>
<P>
Given this great expansion of cinema space, it seems a pity to many designers 
that the architecture of the new multiplexes is usually so commonplace and 
uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
It may never again happen that multitudes of patrons will wander downtown on 
Broadway admiring the glories of the Million Dollar, Los Angeles, Palace, 
Orpheum, United Artists, Tower, Cameo or Roxie, or parade on Hollywood 
Boulevard as they did in the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
But the lack of a distinctive design style in most new multiplexes does not 
mean that fine or fantastic architecture is no longer possible in modern movie 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's 1984 Galaxy Theater, designed by Kaplan McLaughlin and Diaz, is 
a glittering neon-outlined, Post-Modern Art Deco glass cube-and-tower that 
flashes enticement to passing traffic on busy Van Ness Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Eschewing fake nostalgia, crudity or condescension, the Galaxy demonstrates 
that cinema design can still create an urbane and glamorous mise en scene even 
in this more modest movie era.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a moment of warmth in a chilly, unyielding land. Twelve dozen Alaskan 
huskies yelped, growled, yipped and howled from their hutches on thawing muskeg 
and stretched wet paws toward Susan Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
Butcher returned the adoration. She chanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Bugga, bugga, buggabeen . . . the fastest dog there's ever been." Her song was 
for Sluggo, a honey-beige husky with a sore paw. It was raw from ice balls that 
formed between his toes last month when he was leading Butcher's team to 
victory in an 11-day streak of masochism known as the Iditarod Sled Dog Race. 
It was Sluggo's first win. It was Susan Butcher's fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"Dugadee. Dugadoo. Dugadog." That call was for Granite. He has won three 
Iditarods and, says Butcher, is the finest sled dog of this decade. If Granite 
were a horse he'd be Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Then this iron woman crouched deep among her dogs and the spring-softened snow 
and wrapped arms around Elan's shaggy neck; flopped on her belly on a plywood 
doghouse to say boo to Tolstoy; and wrinkled her nose against the wet black 
plug of Heifer's nose. 
</P>
<P>
And Susan Butcher -- emotionally stale from airlines and motels and real 
clothes, mentally exhausted by 10 days of victory greetings, public speaking 
and a meeting with President Bush -- finally was home. 
</P>
<P>
Home. That's Trail Breaker Kennel, five acres of bush surrounding an 
80-year-old log cabin that once belonged to a Gold Rush blacksmith. It is most 
of Eureka (Elev. 270, Pop. 6). Just a scatter of mining shacks among stands of 
silver birch at the end of 140 miles of dirt road not far beneath the Arctic 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Hers is life without television, running water, flush toilets or a bathtub. 
There's a single telephone hooked by satellite to a Seattle area code, but 
that's for husband Dave Monson to use because Butcher regards a ringing phone 
as the ultimate intrusion and refuses to answer it. A run to the grocery store 
is a four-hour rattle by truck to Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
Only in isolation approaching privation, Butcher says, can she maintain an 
uninterrupted focus on breeding and training sled dogs. Only away from the 
noise, stink and structures of man can she intensify an unusual personal 
bonding with her dogs. Only from here can she concentrate on winning next 
year's Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
For a decade, she explains, she has concentrated on a companionship that starts 
with a puppy's first breath and produces dogs ready to drop for her -- huskies 
that have made her not just the best woman dog sled racer in the world, but the 
best dog sled racer in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Some frustrated mushers have suggested that a separate Iditarod race be staged: 
one for men. In sour recognition of her fixation on winning, blind stubbornness 
to the point of impoliteness on the trail, and an easy acceptance of huge risks 
that repel mere males, she has been given a nickname: Ayatollah Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
* In any endurance athlete's life the Iditarod stands as a death wish -- a 
lopsided gamble against survival across 1,130 frostbitten miles, mountain 
ranges, blizzards, and frozen seas between Anchorage and Nome. Only two persons 
have won the Iditarod four times -- Rick Swenson, 38, of Two Rivers, Alaska, 
and Susan Butcher, 35. 
</P>
<P>
* The race record is 11 days, 1 hour and 53 minutes. It belongs to Butcher. Her 
fifth Iditarod championship, said Joe Reddington Jr., a racer and son of the 
1972 founder of the Iditarod, may be considered an inevitability. If anyone 
breaks the 10-day barrier, believe other experts, it will be Susan Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
* In the past winter's schedule of sled dog races -- marked by such contests as 
the John Beargrease Marathon and the Coldfoot Classic -- Butcher entered six 
events. She won four and was second in the others. 
</P>
<P>
"What was the total frustration for the mushers is that Susan took three 
totally separate teams (to the races)," Butcher said. In conversation she often 
inserts herself in the narrative. "Both Susan's A and B dogs blew away the 
other teams and took 10 hours off the record in the Beargrease. 
</P>
<P>
"The C team finished just seven minutes behind the winner in another event and 
would have won it if Susan hadn't been sicker (with flu) than a dog." 
</P>
<P>
There are few places in Alaska where this happy woman with a smile stretching 
from here to the Aleutians can move unrecognized. She has visited two 
Presidents, been commended by legislatures, won the medals and awards of world 
organizations and visited the Soviet Union to counsel perestroika mushers and 
set trails for next year's Alaska-Siberia race. 
</P>
<P>
Butcher has run her dogs in Switzerland and is a friend of Gen. Colin Powell, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because each has been elected to 
membership in the American Academy of Achievement. Her racing has produced a 
major cottage industry in her home state; the smug legend of a million T-shirts 
sold says: "Alaska -- Where Men are Men and Women Win the Iditarod." 
</P>
<P>
Rarely is Butcher an also-ran, except to a media darling like Granite. 
</P>
<P>
On this month's victory tour, the 9-year-old husky, now retired to stud, was 
given his own room at the Ritz-Carlton in St. Louis and the Four Seasons in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Letters from hotel managers were addressed to "Mr. Granite" and propped against 
baskets of Evian water from the French Alps and silver platters of ground 
round. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times," Monson joked, "when we felt the introduction would be: 
Here's Granite who won the Iditarod three times with . . . er . . . um, the 
couple that owns him." 
</P>
<P>
Yet such world attention has cost. 
</P>
<P>
Resentment has been raised against Butcher by veterans who raced in obscurity 
for years because nobody cared much about the Iditarod -- until a woman won. 
Then came reporters from Sports Illustrated and ABC's "World Wide of Sports" 
and Australia and Japan. Said former champion Swenson: "She's a good competitor 
but that's all I can say." Then he said more: "You could ask yourself what have 
they (Butcher and Monson) done for anyone else in the sport? They just take, 
take, take." 
</P>
<P>
Because her trademark finish has always been a sprint -- even after 11 days of 
the punishment of the Iditarod -- there are whispers that Butcher feeds drugs 
to her dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Her teams go so fast at the end of the race," said Robin Jacobson of Squaw 
Lake, Minn., who finished sixth in this year's Iditarod. "I can't understand a 
dog having a three- or four-day adrenaline rush. It would kill them. So that's 
where . . . there is doubt in a lot of minds." 
</P>
<P>
Monson -- a lawyer and public defender, among many former trades -- finds all 
such suggestions slanderous. Racer Reddington thinks the accusation should be 
shoveled aside with caribou droppings. But most important, Jack Morris of 
Wasilla, Alaska, veterinary director of this year's Iditarod, said there was 
routine urine testing -- en route and at the finish -- of several dogs on 
Butcher's winning team. 
</P>
<P>
"All samples were clean," Morris said. "If there was any kind of cheating, we'd 
catch it." 
</P>
<P>
Butcher, a woman of uncluttered beliefs, sees another root of the resentment: 
male frailty. 
</P>
<P>
"I have become a symbol to women across the country -- and internationally, in 
fact -- and I'm not going to say that there wasn't a lot of strength gained by 
that thought and by the support (from women) that I got," she said. She's 
sitting cross-legged in a deep armchair in the log cabin and Meaty, a 
17-year-old Siamese, is asleep in her lap. "The Eskimo women, the Indian women 
literally giving me the physical support of saying as I came through the 
villages: 'Do this for us.' 
</P>
<P>
"It is an amazing feeling to have an Eskimo woman, who has had a totally 
different upbringing from myself, who lives a very traditional life, 
male-femalewise, to look to you to win a race to give her a moral boost." 
</P>
<P>
Most competitors also don't recognize the spiritual link Butcher says she has 
with her huskies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Butcher says, maybe only husband Dave and Trail Breaker's teen-age dog 
handlers, Tanya Schlentner and Jennie Tschappet, the group she calls "the 
sacred few," fully understand. 
</P>
<P>
But to them the flair is clear: Susan Butcher is to Alaskan huskies what Dian 
Fossey was to gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born with a particular ability with animals and a particular love for 
them," she said. "I think that what you get from animals, and what I got from 
my first dog, one of my first close friends, is the security of constant love. 
</P>
<P>
"An animal loves you and you love them and that is just constant. I needed that 
as a child. I have some compositions here, some of those one-liners you write 
in the first grade. Mine said: 'I hate the city, I love the country and I love 
animals.' " 
</P>
<P>
All animals, she added. A pet iguana. A crow on a fence post. Even a hundred 
cows in a field "send me into a total thrill." 
</P>
<P>
So in spring when husky pups are born to her 150-dog kennel, she holds each 
blind thing in her hands and breathes into its nose. That way, she says, the 
dog will associate her smell with comfort and encouragement. The rapport 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
She feeds the dogs. She exercises and trains them. She massages them after 
runs. On a rotation basis, each dog sleeps in the cabin. The family forms. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when a young Granite suffered renal failure from driving himself to 
dehydration, Butcher sat up for five nights with the dog's head in her lap. 
Granite survived and remained a champion. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't say I need to bond with these puppies early," Butcher explains. "I 
want to bond with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that if I don't bond with this puppy I might not win the 
Iditarod, so therefore I have to go out and bond with this puppy. I'm going out 
because I'm absolutely drawn to that." 
</P>
<P>
She also will not ask more of her dogs than they can deliver, she says. The 
huskies know that. So, they often give more than they thought they had. And she 
is infinitely patient with the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"I want every one of these dogs to make my Iditarod team," Butcher continued. 
"So I give everybody their sixth, seventh, and eighth or ninth chance. Whereas 
my competitors -- and I think this is one of the biggest differences -- often 
don't give them a second or third chance." 
</P>
<P>
Granite was a loser. She once offered him for sale for $250. "He didn't come 
around at least until his 10th chance. Sluggo was probably on his 20th chance 
before he came around. 
</P>
<P>
"So you've got two superstars there who would not have even made it in someone 
else's team." And further, "every dog I run was raised in my own kennel by me 
and through my scheme . . . whereas often less than half of somebody else's 
team is raised in their own kennel, and they buy the others." 
</P>
<P>
They buy from Butcher, paying from $1,000 to $10,000 for a trained dog. But 
even at that price, Butcher says, the animal is still one of her discards. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, in Cambridge, Mass., in a family damaged by the death of her 
brother and eventually broken by divorce, Butcher said she relied more on 
animals than people. "I used to say as a kid: 'My mother can die, my father can 
die and my sister can die. But if my dog died, I'd be very unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
She was 18, away from home and already racing huskies before that exclusion 
changed. It came to her as the end of a recurring dream about an Ice Age where 
there were no people, just Susan and her dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Then (in) one dream, the Ice Age melted and it turned out that certain people 
had lived," she said. In the dream she wept because "my life with my dogs alone 
was over. So I went out on my last run before the last of the ice melted. And 
then I had to go back and spend time with people. 
</P>
<P>
"It was then that I was ready to accept that people had a place in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Her childhood was filled with daring. During summers spent in Maine she raced 
13-foot sailing dinghies when gales sent others heading for the dock. Her 
description of childhood is that she was "an individualist . . . hard core, big 
time tomboy . . . a real gambler who took dangers fairly lightly . . . and very 
lopsided academically, because I was a dyslexic who excelled at math." 
</P>
<P>
Her first dog, at 15, was Manganak, named for Zachary Manganak, a Canadian 
Eskimo in one of her children's books. Then she bought a second husky. Her 
mother said two dogs in one house was too much. 
</P>
<P>
"So I left the house rather than not get the dog," Butcher remembered. "But 
happily so, and we maintained a wonderful relationship." 
</P>
<P>
She was 16 then. Butcher went to Nova Scotia and learned to farm and train 
horses and picked up enough carpentry to build a boathouse. She went to join 
her father in Boulder, Colo. Where her stepmother bought her a dog sled. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to pick it up from a woman who had 50 huskies," Butcher said. "Ten 
minutes later I had moved in. I lived with her for a couple of years, worked as 
a veterinary technician and mushed and was frustrated by every minute of it." 
</P>
<P>
She despised Colorado's dropout drug culture, parents, as she saw them, living 
in the mountains and denying schooling to children as an artificial retreat to 
an imagined nature. "It didn't have anything to do with nature . . . it had to 
do with being irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Butcher wanted the life of yesteryear. There must be a place, she reasoned, 
where human survival depended on instincts and dogs were not domestic pets but 
working animals "needed for transportation, to haul your water, to haul your 
wood." 
</P>
<P>
She eyed Western Canada. On her way, she paused in Fairbanks. "I felt at home 
the second I got there." 
</P>
<P>
Butcher worked at a musk ox farm, found a male companion and headed for her 
first winter in the lonely Wrangell Mountains before she had learned her 
partner's last name. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the purest places left in Alaska," she recalled. "The closest 
road was 50 miles away. In Canada. We took in a sack of flour and a slab of 
bacon and a jar of peanut butter and lived off moose and caribou and ptarmigan 
and whatever we could hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a vegetarian when I went out there. I wasn't a vegetarian when I came 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Butcher found "Utopia." She also discovered life in its basic form. "If you 
were going to eat meat, you shot it. You saw its death. You caused its death 
and you ate it and you survived because of its death. 
</P>
<P>
"And you hauled all your own water and everything was dependent on you and the 
reward was living in the most gorgeous spot on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out after that second winter that I was totally rejuvenated," she 
said. "I knew that if I could spend the majority of a year away from people, 
then I could actually adore human beings for about two months . . . even 
strangers." 
</P>
<P>
But only for a short while. "Then I'd fall off and it would be big time bad 
news. Get me out into the bush again. Susan is ready to flip out." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, she moved to Eureka with two objectives: To form a kennel of at least 
100 dogs and build a team to run the Iditarod. They were long, lonely years. 
She lived alone or with handlers when she could afford them. Debts grew. 
Equipment broke. One winter she survived by eating meat bought for the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
But Butcher had goals, a stiff spine, a stubborn mind-set and an eye for any 
opportunity to focus attention on her and the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1979, with Iditarod founder Joe Reddington, she took a dog team to the 
20,320-foot summit of Mt. McKinley. It took 44 days. It also brought public 
interest to the earnest young woman with the braided hair who still believes: 
"I am not a pretty woman and so I became strong . . . I had to do something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
She trains her pups in harness at 4 1/2 months. Each one has been bred for 
essentials. Stamina. Resistance to injury. A sense of teamwork. Courage. 
Stoicism and flexibility of limbs. 
</P>
<P>
Her aim is always to run behind the best dog team anyone ever hitched to a 
sled. Each dog must also have total communication with Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
She deepens the telepathy by singing to the dogs when they are racing, old folk 
songs by Bob Dylan and Joan Baez and maybe some Irish lullabies. 
</P>
<P>
And in the worst moments of several Iditarods -- when there were hallucinations 
from sleep deprivation -- the dogs have saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, jockeying for the lead with two other teams, Butcher was told by race 
supervisors there was no overland trail between Unalakleet and Shaktoolik on 
Norton Sound, which pokes toward the Bering Sea. Crossing sea ice on a moonless 
night was the only choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed the ice was almost billowing," she recalled. "Just as I saw that, I 
told Granite (in lead) to go to the left. Which he did. He was terrified 
because the whole thing (ice) was going like this (rocking) . . . when the sled 
fell through and the whole team and I went in about 30 feet of water." 
</P>
<P>
But then "Granite hit hard ice and he got up on top of it. Him and Maddie. 
Then, two (dogs) by two, they pulled us out. I thought we were goners." 
</P>
<P>
A moose once attacked the team and that cost Butcher the 1985 race, seven years 
of preparation, two dogs killed and 13 injured. Butcher has crossed Norton 
Sound in a blizzard when she couldn't see the lead dog. Navigation was by a 
small compass. For five blind hours she traveled the ice, wondering how close 
she was to the spot where a friend drowned earlier in the year? 
</P>
<P>
"But there's a fun thing about it," she said. She mentioned a quirk known to 
all adventurers. "It's thrilling, isn't it? Especially when you conquer it." 
</P>
<P>
There are activists who see sled dog racing as cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
Butcher snorts at the thought. It is an expression, she says, of uninformed 
city dwellers who know only pampered pets. Pulling sleds "is what they live for 
. . . it is instinctive for them to want to pull. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time they see the harness come out or see the sled, they are 
absolutely going crazy, jumping around, wanting to go and then literally 
jumping into harness." 
</P>
<P>
There also are times when the adrenaline pumps and 12 dogs are galloping as 
one. Then, Butcher says, they don't want to stop. There was the time a tired 
Butcher was racing in the Brooks Range and thought her weariness would be 
contagious. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt these dogs would be fried or at least pick up on my feelings of being 
fried," she said. "But I could not stop them. It was a total thrill. I hooked a 
five-inch diameter tree with my snow hook and they pulled the tree over. I 
tried stopping them for five or six miles and then gave up. 
</P>
<P>
"So they went 35 miles into the next village." 
</P>
<P>
Such moments, she says, make Susan complete. The childhood inadequacies have 
gone. She no longer hunts for role models -- because she has become the very 
person she was always searching for. 
</P>
<P>
Yet is there still a call of the wild for Susan Butcher? 
</P>
<P>
She thought long about that. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the log cabin, Sluggo and Tolstoy and Co-Star and Hermit lie flat, with 
furry bellies toasting in the warm Arctic sun. Monson was playing a tape and 
porch speakers carried the Modern Mandolin Quartet over snow to thicket and 
silent hill. A gray jay snoozed in a tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," Butcher whispered. "It's still calling."

DUKE ELLINGTON'S MUSIC STILL SWEETLY THUNDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Edward Kennedy (Duke) Ellington would have been 91 today. 
</P>
<P>
In a very real sense, however, the Duke lives on today through his music as it 
resounds in some 50 compact discs, in hundreds of tribute albums, and in 
concerts by the still-splendid orchestra that Mercer Ellington took over when 
his father died in May, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Ellington's admirers have worked to elevate his image from that of a popular 
songwriter to a more significant role as composer/arranger of orchestral works, 
from three-minute masterpieces such as "Ko-Ko" and "Harlem Airshaft" to 
extended pieces such as "Black, Brown &amp; Beige," "A Tone Parallel to 
Harlem," "The Far East Suite" and "Night Creature" (this last recorded by the 
band in tandem with the Stockholm and Paris symphonies). 
</P>
<P>
"He is respected more than ever today; this has a lot to do with the increased 
awareness of the greatness of black artists in general -- musicians, painters, 
writers," says jazz composer, arranger and band leader Toshiko Akiyoshi. "The 
jazz community always recognized him, but now there is more understanding of 
the contribution of black artists to society. 
</P>
<P>
"After his death, I suddenly realized that he was very proud of his race, and 
some of his music was an expression of that pride." 
</P>
<P>
"In 20th-Century music, Duke Ellington is finally recognized as one of the 
half-dozen greatest masters of our time," says composer and historian Gunther 
Schuller. 
</P>
<P>
While San Francisco is staging the jazz world's major event of the day, other 
celebrations are planned in New York and elsewhere. In Los Angeles, the local 
branch of the Ellington Society will hold its annual birthday meeting while in 
Washington, Ellington's natal town, members of a jazz ensemble from the city's 
Duke Ellington School of the Arts will offer a brief program of his music at 
his birth site, now known as the Duke Ellington Building. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco: McHenry Boatwright will be one of the singers at Grace Cathedral 
when the Ellington Orchestra today celebrates the 25th anniversary of Duke's 
first sacred recital. 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Copenhagen, where he lives when not touring with the orchestra, 
Mercer Ellington said: "This will be similar to the concert Pop gave when Dean 
Bartlett invited him to Grace Cathedral in 1965. We'll have some of the same 
artists -- Bunny Briggs, the singer and dancer, and narration by Brock Peters. 
Lil Greenwood, who sang with the band in the '60s, will be back, and we'll 
revive 'New World A-Comin', a piano concerto, which Pop played originally. It 
will be performed by someone Ruth discovered -- Lillianne Questel, a classical 
pianist from Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
The sacred concerts fell far short of the critical acclaim for which their 
composer had hoped. Some observers felt they were overloaded with vocals and 
that lyric writing was not Duke's forte. Still, these presentations were 
central to Ellington's thoughts in his final decade. There were three sets of 
religious works, two of which were performed in many houses of prayer; the 
third, completed when Duke was terminally ill with cancer, was presented at 
Westminster Abbey exactly seven months before his death. 
</P>
<P>
New York: "We'll have several observances here," said Ruth Ellington 
Boatwright, Duke's sister. "As always, Pastor John Gensel will preside over the 
Jazz Vespers at St. Peter's Church." (Gensel, a close friend of Duke and 
longtime pastor to the jazz community, was the subject of an Ellington 
composition, "The Shepherd Who Watches Over the Night Flock.") 
</P>
<P>
Following the Vespers, the New York chapter of the Duke Ellington Society will 
present a program of his music by Joe Temperley, the Scots-born musician who 
took over the late Harry Carney's chair with Ellington in 1974. (Carney, the 
preeminent baritone saxophonist, was in the band for 47 years, loyal to the 
end.) 
</P>
<P>
One tribute to the maestro is literally monumental. A 20-foot tall bronze 
sculpture, topped off by a life-size Ellington standing at a grand piano, has 
been completed and is awaiting placement in its designated site at the 
northeast entrance to Central Park in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The statue was a dream of Bobby Short, the singer and pianist who over the past 
few years, as president of the Duke Ellington Memorial Fund, has organized a 
series of fund-raisers to pay the million-dollar fee to sculptor Robert Graham. 
"It's in his studio now," Short said in a call from New York. "That area of the 
park is being completely renovated and relandscaped. We have Mayor Dinkins on 
our side, helping to expedite it, and we hope to have the statue in place by 
the end of this year -- or at least by Duke's next birthday." 
</P>
<P>
Ottawa: From May 17-20, the eighth annual Duke Ellington Conference will be 
held at the Chateau Laurier Hotel in Ottawa. Former Ellingtonians will 
reminisce about Duke and his perennial associate Billy Strayhorn (composer of 
the band's theme, "Take the A Train," and close collaborator from 1939 until 
his death in 1967). Alice Babs, the Swedish diva who sang and many Ellington 
concerts, will come out of retirement. Harold Ashby will be there, as will 
Ellington educator Kenny Burrell.

POP FACES: THE WONDER STUFF: PARENTAL GUIDANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The purpose of rock 'n' roll? 
</P>
<P>
Miles Hunt, lead singer of the English band the Wonder Stuff, holds to the 
traditional view that it's to annoy parents. That's why he's delighted to see 
British teens latching on to the sounds and styles of such "acid revival" bands 
as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, even if he doesn't always care for that 
music and fashion himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's brilliant that this music is around and 15-year-old kids are 
getting into it and they know it's wrong but that's why they get into it," he 
said by phone from his manager's London office. 
</P>
<P>
But Hunt, 23, admits that he is an exception to his own rule -- his parents 
actively cultivated his love for rebellious rock. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad bought me the Sex Pistols album for Christmas when I was about 10 and 
said, 'You ought to listen to this, I think it's important,' " he said. 
Meantime, all his friends had to hide the same record under their beds. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents taught me to do what you . . . like, basically," he said in a 
conversation peppered with expletives. "Don't mill around being a (jerk). If 
you've got a point, get to it. I don't like doing anything by halves, and 
that's what they instilled in me." 
</P>
<P>
But if his rock 'n' roll attitude hasn't offended his parents, it has offended 
others, notably the British rock press. He alienated many last year while the 
band was promoting its debut album, "The Eight Legged Groove Machine," which 
introduced the Wonder Stuff's brew of edgy garage-pop. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably more my fault than anything, because I'm not one for 
particularly being reasonable," Hunt said. "If I have something on my mind I 
come out and say it. I probably asked for it. I've kind of mellowed a little 
bit since then." 
</P>
<P>
He really asked for it when he mouthed off about the band the Mission U.K. But 
once he met the group all turned out well, and the two outfits are fast friends 
-- in fact, they're touring together, with the Wonder Stuff opening the shows. 
The bill plays the Hollywood Palladium on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a jealousy thing really," Hunt said of his initial dislike for the 
Mission. "I had a pet hate for them because they were big. But I like their 
music and these days I can't be bothered with jealousy." 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't to say he's through mouthing off. With a second album, "Hup," doing 
well in England and drawing considerable alternative-market attention in the 
U.S., Hunt is feeling his oats again. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to (mess) with us, we'll (mess) with anyone, 'cause we feel strong 
again," he said. "We got to the point last year where it got too easy. . . . 
But there's a good mood about the band and we're ready to (mess) with people 
again." STEVE HOCHMAN

MEXICO'S CHURCH-STATE TIES STEP OUT FROM THE SHADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Carlos Bravo, a Jesuit theologian who works out of a discreet office in 
a colonial neighborhood of Mexico City, tells of an exchange he had with a 
Venezuelan colleague who boasted that the church-state relationship in his 
country was the most stable marriage in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, the soft-spoken Bravo responded, the church and state are not 
married but are participants in "the most stable concubinage there is." 
</P>
<P>
For more than half a century, the Mexican government has had what Bravo calls 
"a backdoor relationship" with the Roman Catholic Church. Mexico is 
overwhelmingly Catholic, at least nominally, yet the church has no legal 
standing under the constitution. Mexico is the only country in Latin America 
that does not have diplomatic ties with the Vatican. Dialogue between 
government and religious leaders is largely clandestine. 
</P>
<P>
But President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has moved to bring the church-state 
relationship out of the dark. Salinas, who took office Dec. 1, 1988, invited 
Cardinal Ernesto Corripio Ahumada and several bishops to his inauguration in 
the Chamber of Deputies and vowed to "modernize" relations with the church. 
</P>
<P>
That ignited anti-clerical sentiment within the ruling party and brought a cry 
from opposition politicians that the new president had violated the separation 
of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Salinas issued a rare, if not unprecedented, invitation to the 
president of the Mexican Bishops Conference, Archbishop Adolfo Suarez Rivera, 
and other prelates to dine at Los Pinos, his official residence. 
</P>
<P>
A thrilled Suarez told the newspaper El Universal, "We entered through the 
front door." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in February, the government announced that "a personal representative of 
the president of the republic" would be sent to the Vatican. That decision 
provoked a new wave of criticism, but church officials viewed the naming of a 
presidential envoy as a major advance. 
</P>
<P>
The visit of Pope John Paul II -- he is to arrive Sunday and spend 10 days in 
Mexico -- is providing new fuel for the church-state debate. At issue is 
whether the government should establish full diplomatic relations with the 
Vatican and amend the constitution to grant full rights of citizenship to the 
clergy and church institutions. 
</P>
<P>
It is a complicated debate, in a once-conquered country with a revolutionary 
past that sees no contradiction between Catholicism and anti-clericalism. A Los 
Angeles Times poll last year found that 80% of those interviewed considered 
themselves Catholic, but 74% said the church should have "no voice" in the 
nation's politics. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic leaders say the opponents of change are "medieval" and "Jacobins." The 
response is that the church is hungry for power. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to lower expectations about the Pope's visit, Cardinal Corripio 
announced at a Palm Sunday Mass that diplomatic relations with the Vatican and 
constitutional amendments are not the church's immediate priorities. Many 
church observers took the announcement to mean just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"As the Pope's trip nears, the hierarchy wanted to lessen the pressure," said 
Roberto Blancarte, an authority on church-state relations at the Colegio 
Mexiquense in the state of Mexico. "They do not want any problems around the 
visit." 
</P>
<P>
But Blancarte said the church is steadfastly pursuing constitutional changes 
that will allow it to play a larger role in Mexican society and politics. At 
the same time, he said, President Salinas, in his push to modernize Mexico, has 
decided to reduce the size and role of the Mexican state. Salinas announced 
last year that the big, paternalistic governments of the Mexican Revolution had 
failed to meet the country's social needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican state has been undergoing a transformation," Blancarte said, "but 
the Catholic hierarchy has been consolidating its project. It is a very clear 
project to reclaim their rights as a church institution." 
</P>
<P>
He said the history of the Catholic Church in Mexico is one of avarice, "of 
siding with the losers." 
</P>
<P>
With the Spanish conquest in 1521 came well-intentioned missionaries who tried 
to protect the Indians from slavery and other abuses. But the church grew 
increasingly wealthy, and in time brought the Inquisition to the New World. By 
the 19th Century, the Catholic Church owned half the land in Mexico and 
actively opposed its independence from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1850s, the liberal, reformist President Benito Juarez decided to break 
the church's power. His government stripped the church of its property, except 
for church buildings, closed monasteries and convents, nationalized cemeteries 
and made marriage a strictly civil act. 
</P>
<P>
The church regained some of its power under the dictator Porfirio Diaz, and 
thus allied itself with the rich in opposing the Mexican Revolution in 1910. 
After Diaz fell, the church supported another would-be dictator, Victoriano 
Huerta. And when Huerta gave way to Venustiano Carranza, the new president's 
followers drafted a constitution that was even more anti-clerical than Juarez's 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The 1917 constitution, still in effect, gave the state possession of all 
clerical property, including the churches, and the power to limit the number of 
priests. Nuns and priests were forbidden to join political parties, to vote or 
even to wear clerical garb in public. The constitution banned parochial schools 
and outlawed religious ceremonies outside the churches. Foreigners were 
forbidden to serve as priests. 
</P>
<P>
But the constitution was not enforced until 1926. President Plutarco Elias 
Calles closed church schools and monasteries, deported foreign clergy and 
ordered Mexican clergy to register with the government. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction was violent. The church shut its doors in protest for three years, 
and conservative peasants took up arms against the government, with the 
blessing if not the direct leadership of priests. The religious rebels, the 
so-called Cristeros, burned government buildings and killed officials. The army 
burned churches, hanged priests, shot Cristeros or locked them in concentration 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, the two sides learned to live with each other. Over the last 50 
years, the church has managed to acquire property by setting up private 
corporations. Parochial schools are tolerated, as are foreign priests and 
open-air Masses. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, clergy are seen wearing vestments in public, though they still 
risk public rebuke. Soledad Loaeza, an authority on the church at the Colegio 
de Mexico and an adamant opponent of constitutional change, tells of coming 
upon two nuns in habits in the produce section of a supermarket. To the nuns' 
shock, Loaeza took the liberty of reminding them that they were violating the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
When Pope John Paul II visited Mexico in 1979, he was received at the airport 
by President Jose Lopez Portillo, at the time a bold step for a Mexican 
president. This time, the Pope not only will be received by Salinas, like any 
other head of state, but he will sit down to dinner with three former 
presidents of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Bishops Conference wrote a letter to Salinas in June, 1989, 
outlining its proposed constitutional changes. The bishops argued that the 
historical circumstances that produced the 1917 constitution have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican people, the bishops said, "are obligated to live a double life, one 
that is reality and one that is the law." They said this "causes a 
disorientation of consciences and is the source of grave moral corruption, 
because of the lack of regard for the law in which it originates." 
</P>
<P>
The bishops asked the government to recognize the "fundamental right to freedom 
of religion or belief, not only of individuals but also and especially of 
churches and religious communities. . . ." They would give churches the right 
to own property and have parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
But Father Bravo says there are splits within the church over the importances 
of these constitutional changes. Some say the church's energy should be focused 
on pastoral work. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask ourselves how we would work better, in a legality that will tie our 
hands or in an illegality that allows us to do as we want," Bravo said. 
</P>
<P>
Many political observers, in and out of the church, argue that Salinas' 
overtures to the church hierarchy stem from a need to bolster his personal 
standing with the people. Salinas was elected with the lowest vote ever for a 
presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI); the 
opposition charges that the election was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
But while Salinas may acquire a measure of legitimacy from the church, by 
publicly acknowledging its existence he allows it more room to act politically, 
as does the church in such countries as El Salvador, Chile and Brazil. And that 
could prove to be a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Jesuits issued a scathing report on the Mexican government's 
human rights record for 1989, citing scores of killings, kidnapings and 
incidents of torture by the police, the armed forces and PRI loyalists. The 
report accused the government of widespread fraud in state elections and 
criticized economic austerity measures that are hurting the poor. It was the 
third time that the Miguel A. Pro Human Rights Center had issued a report on 
the government but the first time that it had released the study to the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether because of the evolution of the Mexican state, or the weakness of the 
Mexican state, there was room to publicize this," Bravo said. 
</P>
<P>
After the report's publication in the magazine Proceso, Jesuit officials were 
called in by Interior Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios for a subtle 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
"He let us know the president was upset," Bravo said. 
</P>
<P>
The church hierarchy, meanwhile, has kept a low profile on political issues, 
apparently preferring to demonstrate that they are not a threat to the 
government. Church officials have not embraced the Jesuits' report, and they 
have said relatively little about the violence that has taken dozens of lives 
in Guerrero and Michoacan states following elections that the opposition says 
were fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the church's conciliatory stance, few people are predicting rapid 
or radical change in the church-state relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between the church and state in Mexico is a process," said 
Msgr. Genaro Alamilla, a spokesman for the Bishops Conference. "It is a process 
that has not reached its goal . . . a process that can be accelerated sometimes 
and slow sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Blancarte, who would like to see priests granted individual rights but wants no 
recognition of the church as an institution, argues that the constitution is 
the "modern" approach to the church. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the 16th Century," he said, "religion has increasingly become a private 
affair. Secularization, the separation of the social and political on one hand 
and religion on the other, is modern."

FEW VIET EXILES FIND U.S.RICHES; 
</P>
<P>
REFUGEES HAVE FORGED AN ENDURING STEREOTYPE OF ECONOMIC AND INTELLECTUAL 
OVERACHIEVEMENT. BUT MOST LIVE IN POVERTY, WITH SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE AND 
CULTURAL HANDICAPS. 
</P>

<P>
They were generals and peasants, schoolteachers and spies, physicians and 
fishermen, and they became in America a poignant symbol of the refugee's will 
to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600,000 Vietnamese fled to this country to escape the long war that 
rampaged throughout Southeast Asia, tearing lives and the political order 
asunder. 
</P>
<P>
A few became millionaires. Many more have earned doctorates and found business 
success. Their assimilation forged an enduring stereotype of economic and 
intellectual overachievement. 
</P>
<P>
But, 15 years after the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, Vietnamese in the 
United States are still suffering from the legacy of defeat and the pain of 
exile. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a majority of Vietnamese refugees in the United States today live in 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity is glaring in Orange County, home to Little Saigon, the nation's 
largest Vietnamese community. Among the 100,000 people who have flocked to the 
neighborhoods along Bolsa Avenue are wealthy exiles such as former Premier 
Nguyen Cao Ky -- and thousands of refugees on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans drive by Bolsa Avenue, and it's so thriving, so prosperous, that 
that's their image of Vietnamese refugees. It's not true," said Tuong Duy 
Nguyen, executive director of Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a 
social service agency. "Most refugees are still living under the poverty line." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese-Americans of all backgrounds continue to describe themselves as 
refugees, not immigrants. And many say they are homesick. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our people have a hidden depression," said Garden Grove businessman 
Phong Duc Tran. "We were uprooted suddenly from our country and had to come 
here. The Koreans, the Japanese, they planned for years to come here; they 
wanted to come here. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The image of Vietnamese success in America is largely based on one segment of 
the refugee population -- the Westernized, highly educated elite who left South 
Vietnam just before or shortly after Saigon surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
But most, in fact, arrived after 1978, with significant language, cultural and 
educational handicaps. Many remain dependent on welfare, stuck in minimum-wage 
jobs, or consigned to an exploitative underground economy. Last year, refugee 
unemployment was twice the national average. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Saigon came much more quickly than most South Vietnamese 
dreamed. Sixty-one percent of the 1975 arrivals had less than 24 hours to 
prepare to leave. Tales of well-connected South Vietnamese scrambling aboard 
U.S. helicopters in 1975 with suitcases stuffed with gold were probably 
exaggerated. Though some did take family jewelry or gold, their only portable 
asset, many more fled with nothing but their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
What the first refugees did bring, however, was education, class and 
connections. Sociologists quickly discovered that the 130,000 refugees who fled 
in 1975 tended to be well-to-do (more than 40%, for example, had owned 
automobiles in Vietnam) and Westernized. Many had studied abroad or had 
American friends. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, the 1975 arrivals were far better educated than their 
countrymen. Forty-eight percent had university degrees, whereas less than 1% of 
the Vietnamese population as a whole did. Three-quarters spoke at least some 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with these advantages -- and an outpouring of sympathy from the American 
public that has not been sustained -- the first Vietnamese adjusted relatively 
quickly. Though many did stints as janitors and dishwashers, most soon landed 
middle-class jobs. Men and women worked day and night, shared housing and 
pooled their earnings. By the early 1980s, federal tax returns show, household 
income of the 1975 arrivals had equaled the U.S. average. Many of their 
children were valedictorians. 
</P>
<P>
But such refugees account for only about one-third of the Vietnamese-American 
population. The other two-thirds have less education, less upward mobility and 
less hope -- characteristics that prompted one scholar to compare them to the 
permanent American underclass. 
</P>
<P>
The later arrivals tended to be young, rural people who spoke little English 
and had few skills of value in the West. For example, a survey of Southeast 
Asians in San Diego County found that the average 1975 arrival was a high 
school graduate but that the average 1980 arrival had not completed sixth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
They had survived not only war, but often prison camp, persecution, genocide, 
rape by Thai pirates, and the numbing degradation of refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
"They arrived en masse, overwhelming existing resettlement programs," said 
Ruben G. Rumbaut, professor of sociology at San Diego State University. "And 
they arrived at the worst possible time -- during the highest inflation in 
memory, followed by the worst recession in 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
The boat people have stayed poorer for longer than the first refugees. In San 
Diego during the recession of 1983, for example, Rumbaut found that 75% of all 
Southeast Asian refugees were living below the poverty line, but that only 25% 
of the Vietnamese who arrived in 1975 were. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 1.2 million Southeast Asians live in the United States. Most statistics 
tend to lump them as a group, masking important differences. A closer look, 
however, shows that post-1978 arrivals -- and in some cases their children -- 
are not climbing the economic ladder nearly as fast as their predecessors. 
After a decade in this country, some are still stuck near the bottom rung. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the new arrivals don't speak English very well, that's for 
sure, and they don't have marketable skills," said Tuong Duy Nguyen, who argues 
that English and job-training programs are inadequate and geared to produce 
only short-term results. "Nearly 100% get entry-level jobs, but they have no 
hope for promotion because they have no skills. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to welfare dependency is a rising divorce rate. One Vietnamese 
social worker estimates that divorces among refugees have tripled, the product 
of long separations, treacherous shifts in traditional sex roles, and more 
lenient divorce laws. California welfare officials have also noticed an 
increase in the number of single-parent refugee households. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the later arrivals are slowly improving their incomes. But by the 
late 1980s they had yet to match the income of the 1975 arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
The gap has sparked subtle tensions within the Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
Over lunch in a chic French-style restaurant in Orange County's Little Saigon, 
a proud and educated man from an upper-class background complained that the 
latest refugees are lazy and abuse American generosity. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left in '75, I didn't know what my future was," said the man, who now 
owns a flourishing business and drives a Mercedes-Benz. "I just wanted freedom. 
And I accepted (sic) to die at sea. But now the Vietnamese who come here, they 
know they'll have welfare, they know they'll have an easy life. . . . They are 
not prepared to work." 
</P>
<P>
Others say the new arrivals have simply been worn down by more than 30 years of 
war, followed by 15 years of poverty and repression. 
</P>
<P>
Quynh N. Nguyen of Lakewood, a former South Vietnamese navy captain who fled in 
1975, blamed the communists for what he sees as the latecomers' tendency toward 
demoralization and dependency. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to my friends and relatives who came later," Nguyen said. "They are 
exhausted, mentally and physically, and do not have the will to live." 
</P>
<P>
Recent arrivals are aware of such attitudes and resent them. 
</P>
<P>
"The latecomers, they say, 'Those who came in '75, they stick their nose in the 
air,' " said Christine Nguyet Pham, who arrived in 1989 and is now a caseworker 
for Orange County Refugee Community Resources Opportunity Project Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But if the 1975 arrivals seem elitist, some of the latecomers, who tend to have 
less experience of the West, often have wildly unrealistic attitudes about life 
in America, according to several recent arrivals from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Many denizens of Ho Chi Minh City read letters from rich relatives and dream of 
joining them in a life of ease, said Tien Tat Chu, a former re-education camp 
inmate who arrived in Huntington Beach in January. "In Saigon, they say that 
even the lamppost wants to go to America." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese, accustomed to a slower, more social way of life, are unprepared for 
the hustle and bustle of American capitalism, said Pham, calling it a "work, 
work, work machine." 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of scholars argue that the myth of the miraculous Southeast 
Asian refugee has made life more difficult for the struggling majority. Such 
stereotypes imply that those who are not instant successes have only themselves 
to blame, said Steven J. Gold, assistant professor of sociology at Whittier 
College, the scholar who compared the plight of the newly arrived refugees to 
that of the American underclass. 
</P>
<P>
Kristy Tran, a 19-year-old Golden West College student who arrived in 1979, is 
one of those struggling. When she was 5, her father was arrested by communist 
soldiers. He never returned. At 10, her mother sent her off by boat with two 
cousins. Now she studies, works and lives in a rented room so she can save 
money to send back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think I'm weak, that I cannot handle the pressure, that I just 
want to forget the people in Vietnam and my mom," she said. "But I have to 
support them. Fifty dollars here can support my mom and my brother (there) for 
a month. I send them about $600 a year." 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans, Tran said, think Vietnamese are rich, and some are jealous. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I go to the gas station, and American guy comes up to me and ask me 
for a dollar because he thinks I have money," she said. "Americans only base 
(their attitudes) on the action of one part of the community and judge all of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
To some Americans, including a group of Orange County combat veterans recently 
interviewed, the Vietnamese refugees are a living symbol of a humiliating 
military defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese-Americans are well aware of such sentiments and often feel wounded. 
In a 1989 Times Orange County poll of 400 adults, 62% said there is "a lot" or 
"some" prejudice against Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Rich or poor, refugees are unanimous in noting that America's welcome has grown 
cooler of late. 
</P>
<P>
Liem Huu Nguyen, for example, a peasant boy turned successful attorney, is the 
stuff refugee myths are made of. But he says he might not have done as well had 
he arrived in America in 1985 instead of 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, born in a tiny village in central Vietnam, was once a skinny boy who 
went to school hungry. "My friends discovered that I never ate lunch," he said. 
"In fact, I never ate breakfast." When he was 12, friends brought him home to 
dinner, and he asked them why the soup was so delicious. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it had meat in it," Nguyen explained. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen's youth and peasant background made him atypical of the 1975 arrivals. 
His English was poor, and he was unschooled in Western ways; his first contact 
with American culture had come as a teen-ager, when some passing GIs threw him 
cigarettes, chewing gum and a Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, an hour after Saigon surrendered, he climbed aboard one of the 
last South Vietnamese army helicopters leaving the Can Tho army base. At the 
age of 18, he found himself in a foreign land called Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, Americans he met in 1975 bent over backward to help him. He was 
admitted to Oklahoma State, although his English was still inadequate. Once 
there, his grades were not good enough to join an international fraternity to 
which he wanted to belong. He went begging to the dean and was invited to join. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen earned a master's degree, then a law degree at Hastings School of Law in 
San Francisco. He now has a private practice in San Jose and Oakland. Many of 
his clients are young Vietnamese who have run afoul of the law. 
</P>
<P>
These young arrivals, he said, have been given fewer opportunities and received 
less hospitality from communities that already feel burdened by large Southeast 
Asian populations. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, he said, "America is sick of refugees." 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese-Americans say they are deeply grateful for the help they have 
received. But they feel they dare not ask for more. 
</P>
<P>
"The community now is strong enough to help their fellows," said Xuan Nhi Van 
Ho, executive director of the Orange County Refugee Community Resources 
Opportunity Project. "Many Vietnamese community leaders don't want the 
government to feel that refugees are a burden on them. . . . If we keep asking 
for more help, they will cut the refugee quota." 
</P>
<P>
And Vietnamese worry that they have developed a bad image. Many are mortified 
by the presence of Southeast Asian youth gangs, which have grown more violent 
and almost always prey on their own countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs and crime were cited as the single most serious community problem in The 
Times survey, named twice as often as problems with jobs or assimilation. But 
in recent interviews, Vietnamese-Americans expressed both shame and anger over 
what they see as overheated media coverage of the gangs, of welfare fraud, 
microchip theft and other crimes committed by Asians. 
</P>
<P>
And though the recent flood of books and films by Americans about the Vietnam 
War may be cathartic for Americans, Vietnamese find them distorted and 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We despise these movies tremendously," said Duc Au, host of a Vietnamese radio 
program at UC Irvine. Au said the films show Vietnamese people as prostitutes, 
faceless enemies or victims of American -- never communist -- atrocities. 
Vietnamese are never shown as soldiers fighting for their own country alongside 
the Americans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't know anything about the Vietnam War at all, I would think the 
Americans did all the dirty work and the Vietnamese were back in the cities 
having fun," Au said. 
</P>
<P>
Such images are especially undermining to young Vietnamese, said Thieu Quang 
Nguyen, 27, a graduate student in computer science at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the things associated with the word Vietnam are negative: the Vietnam 
War, the cheating in Little Saigon, the gangs," Nguyen said. "And kids grow up 
hurt inside." 
</P>
<P>
It is another paradox of the Vietnamese experience that the number of 
Vietnamese dropouts and juvenile delinquents is increasing at the same time 
that many other young Vietnamese are astounding their teachers with their 
academic prowess. Such contradictory realities belie facile stereotypes about 
Asian students as disciplined super-achievers. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego in 1986, Rumbaut and his colleagues found that although only 7% of 
the city's students were Vietnamese, 23% of the year's valedictorians and 
salutatorians were. And Vietnamese-American students had, on average, higher 
grades than whites. But Vietnamese were dropping out at slightly higher rates 
than white students. 
</P>
<P>
That pattern is repeated at Orange County's Westminster High School, where 52% 
of the straight-A students are Indochinese. But by 1987, the Vietnamese dropout 
rate had soared to nearly double the school average, prompting the district to 
launch a special anti-dropout program for them. 
</P>
<P>
Rumbaut found that it was the children who came to the United States without 
one or both parents who were far more likely to drop out of school or get in 
trouble with the police. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Liem Huu Nguyen, who has represented many youth offenders, said most 
of his clients are recent arrivals who come from 
</P>
<P>
broken families and speak little English. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Vietnamese-American experience cannot be explained by the mere 
facts of background, income or education. What drives many refugees is the 
immeasurable desire to reconstruct, from the shards of their former identities, 
lives to be proud of, families that are whole and enduring. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1984 mental health survey of Vietnamese, almost half reported feelings of 
depression, anxiety, hopelessness or worthlessness, compared with only 
one-quarter of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Time does appear to be healing many of those wounds, the study found. But scars 
linger. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ton-That Niem, once a secretary of health in Vietnam, now a psychiatrist 
specializing in refugee mental health, said he has treated many refugees with 
post-traumatic stress disorder. Many were rape victims or had seen relatives 
killed. Others, particularly middle-age women, complain of insomnia, anxiety, 
headaches, stomachaches and backaches -- and a terrible feeling of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'I came here, I cannot go out. I cannot drive. All my children or 
grandchildren are gone to work or in class.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then they break into tears and say, 'Had I known life (would be like this), I 
would not have come here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Niem says Westerners underestimate the pain that Vietnamese, especially elders, 
feel about the separation from their ancestral homeland and its 4,000-year-old 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, signs of hope in Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, the shopping district is jammed with families pushing strollers 
and children who chatter away in English and Vietnamese. Despite their poverty, 
Vietnamese-Americans have the lowest infant-mortality rate of any ethnic group 
in the nation. Researchers cite abstinence from smoking, alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Business is booming. There are cultural festivals, Vietnamese-language classes 
for children, more than two dozen newspapers, a $1.2-million senior citizens 
center under construction, a television station and a vibrant nightclub scene. 
Most of all, Little Saigon is a place to be Vietnamese in America, but at ease. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years of exile, many are also reaching back to Vietnam for solace. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of Vietnamese say privately that they support normalization of 
relations between Washington and Hanoi. Risking the wrath of devoutly 
anti-communist fellow exiles, thousands have quietly returned to visit. 
</P>
<P>
During the Tet Festival this February, so many Californians headed for Vietnam 
that it was virtually impossible to get a seat on a plane, according to one who 
made the trek. 
</P>
<P>
Mai Cong, chairman of Vietnamese Community of Orange County and a community 
activist, said she has not been back, but she has made peace with her memories 
of home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the memory of your childhood, the places where you were raised, where 
your parents are, where your ancestors are buried," Cong explained. "It's 
priceless. It is inside you." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Tony Marcano and Thuan Le contributed to this story.

The Vietnam Exodus 
</P>
<P>
1. In April, 1975, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese flee south as coastal 
cities surrender. 
</P>
<P>
2. U.S. Marines begin evacuating remaining Americans from Saigon. However, 
enemy shelling closes Tan Son Nhut Air Base, forcing evacuation by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
3. Gen. Duong Van Minh surrenders unconditionally on April 30 at 10:24 a.m. By 
then, more than 100,000 South Vietnamese had already fled. 
</P>
<P>
4. In 1978, Vietnam invades Cambodia, and China invades Vietnam. Vietnam then 
expels its ethnic Chinese. The exodus of "boat people" begins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees who arrived in 1975 hailed from Vietnam's military, 
professional and social elite. They account for fewer than one-third of all 
refugees. Later arrivals tended to be rural, with less education and fewer 
skills, and have had far more trouble achieving economic self-sufficiency.

ON CALIFORNIA: PAINTING THE TOWN GREEN

<P>
SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mean, dry season up here. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago there was a sociologist in Israel who studied droughts. He 
discovered that towns under water stress all unravel in predictable patterns. 
Something about the deprivation of water wears people down, and they grow 
suspicious of each other. Accusations of favoritism and water gluttony become 
common. Things turn ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Santa Barbara coast is not exactly the same as the kibbutzim of 
rural Israel. No one is bathing out of buckets yet in Montecito or Hope Ranch. 
But still, you can see the unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, the elderly lady dressed in Irish tweeds and carrying a 
Bottega Venetta bag on Santa Barbara's main street. She is wandering up and 
down the sidewalk picking cigarette butts out of planter boxes. The butts 
absorb water from the dirt, she says. Each butt is like a small, filthy sponge. 
They rob water from the flowers, which are dying anyway because the city has 
turned off the faucets. 
</P>
<P>
She scoops the butts out of the dirt, a dozen at a time, and stuffs them into a 
plastic bag. With each scoop, a small cloud of dust lifts into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is so dry, she says. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the man who believes that tourists are at the root of Santa 
Barbara's crisis. The City Council, he says in a letter to a newspaper, has 
forced residents to let their lawns and gardens die so the visiting hordes of 
summer can take long showers. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about your dying fruit trees," he says. "Then think about all the extra 
glasses of water consumed by people for whom spicy Mexican food is a novelty. 
Think about the tons of ice crushed in blenders for margaritas." 
</P>
<P>
And from time to time, the deprivation drives some to small misdemeanors. Out 
at Hope Ranch, there is an old woman with Alzheimer's who doesn't know from 
water. She's very far gone, never leaves her $2-million house. Most important, 
she doesn't guard her outside faucets. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, this vulnerability would go unnoticed in Hope Ranch, where 
deprivation, historically speaking, has not been a condition of life. But this 
year it's different. Life is more Darwinian. This year vulnerabilities are 
spotted quickly. So a garden hose has been quietly attached to the faucet at 
the Alzheimer's lady's house and run to a neighbor's lawn, where it freshens 
the swimming pool. In Hope Ranch, these days, you use it or lose it. 
</P>
<P>
But if you don't happen to have an Alzheimer's lady living next door, there is 
always the greywater man. The greywater man comes in a truck and will deliver 
any amount of water you want. At a price. It's all very legal because this 
water is slightly used. 
</P>
<P>
Just where it got used, the greywater man doesn't know. It is regarded as 
indelicate to ask. Anyway, you don't drink greywater, you don't mix it with 
Scotch. But you can screw a hose to the greywater tank and, with an air of 
great profligacy, wash down your driveway. If the neighbors turn you in to the 
water cops, and they probably will because the authorities now encourage 
snitching, you can point to the source and laugh. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, you could argue that Santa Barbara has become a laboratory 
experiment for the rest of us. This is the first place in California where the 
water has started to run out. What happens here will happen to L.A. and Orange 
counties next year, or the year after, if the dry winters continue. You can 
watch Santa Barbara and see the future. 
</P>
<P>
And the news is not all gloomy. The crisis has seen the emergence of Dr. Dirt 
in Santa Barbara, a man whose time has come. Dr. Dirt paints lawns green at $30 
per thousand square feet and has offered his services to the city during the 
summer Fiesta period. For a modest fee, Dr. Dirt will guarantee that the sunken 
gardens around the downtown courthouse stay freshly green during the gala. The 
City Council is considering the plan. 
</P>
<P>
And there is Wilson Hubbell, manager of the county's Solid Waste Division, who 
believes he has found an unusual solution to an unusual problem. It seems that 
thousands of old, water-guzzler toilets are being tossed out by Santa Barbarans 
in favor of the mini-flush variety. This mountain of discarded toilets, Hubbell 
proposed recently, could be collected, stored, and mounted on a barge. 
</P>
<P>
The barge would proceed out beyond the surf line and dump all those symbols of 
yesterday's wasteful flushing into the drink, creating what Hubbell described 
as a "decent offshore reef." The fish would love it. 
</P>
<P>
You might clip and save this idea. One of these days, down in L.A., we may have 
our own reef to build.

CAL STATE SYSTEM PLOTS NEW COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: CHANCELLOR W. ANN REYNOLDS' RESIGNATION IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE 
MORE AUTONOMY TO THE 20 CAMPUSES, SAY FACULTY, TRUSTEES AND OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The forced resignation of Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds has unleashed a movement 
to trim the power of the California State University's central headquarters in 
Long Beach and give more autonomy to the system's 20 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
From Humboldt State, nestled comfortably among redwoods in the north, to the 
overcrowded, urban campus of San Diego State in the south, the diversity of the 
Cal State system was not encouraged enough under Reynolds, say faculty, 
trustees and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
And while her fall earlier this month was caused by controversies over secret 
spending on top salaries, it also creates a chance for the campuses to assert 
themselves, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that you will be seeing a lot more emphasis on the strengths of the 
individual campuses," said trustee Martha Fallgatter, who is a contender to 
become vice chairman of the system's governing board next month. "We will be 
looking to that rather than having everything so centralized." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh O. La Bounty, president of Cal Poly Pomona, agreed: "I would hope that 
whatever new administration comes in would support the notion that each 
university has its own goals and objectives and separate identity. That has 
been a battle." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' departure also means an indefinite delay in Cal State's plans to 
build as many as five more campuses and a temporary halt to the university's 
attempts to offer doctorate degrees independent of the University of 
California, officials say. Instead, they stress, the Cal State system must 
first repair its reputation, damaged by the spending controversies, and repair 
ties with legislators and the governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first job is to get into the process of healing. That is the priority 
issue," said Herbert L. Carter, executive vice chancellor. "We can't allow 
those things to stand as they are. They have to be healed in the interest of 
the 360,000 students enrolled in this system." Carter is to head the system 
between the time when Reynolds leaves office, possibly Oct. 1, and the 
selection of a new chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview last week, Reynolds declined to discuss events leading 
to her resignation April 20, as she faced possible firing for her handling of 
the 21% to 43% raises for herself and 26 other officials. In agreeing to talk 
about the system generally, however, she said decentralization was a "top 
priority" since she became chancellor in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"In any system, there is always that tension (between central headquarters and 
campuses). And I think sometimes people think if it weren't for Golden Shore," 
she said, referring to the location of her Long Beach office, "they would have 
more money." 
</P>
<P>
She contended the culprit is the rigid state formula that awards money to 
campuses based solely on the equivalent of full-time enrollments and does not 
take into account the many remedial programs at urban campuses or the cost of 
keeping buildings open at night for part-time students. Reynolds said campuses 
will receive extra monies to use as the schools see fit if voters in June 
approve Proposition 111, which would increase gasoline taxes and raise the 
state's spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Legislature may be so suspicious of the Cal State system because 
of the pay raise controversy that lawmakers may be unwilling to change spending 
formulas, said Kenneth O'Brien, executive director of the California 
Postsecondary Education Commission. 
</P>
<P>
He and other education experts stress that a new chancellor must be more 
skillful than Reynolds in dealing with the Legislature. Moreover, Gov. George 
Deukmejian is concerned that Cal State's image of profligacy jeopardizes 
passage of Proposition 111. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Ostar, president of the American Assn. of State Colleges and 
Universities, said the Cal State system became more centralized under Reynolds 
and her predecessor, Glenn S. Dumke, than other institutions around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think business and industry have moved a long way from centralized 
management to a decentralized system and higher education has been lagging 
behind," Ostar said in a telephone interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, the Cal State system was created out of what had been 16 independent 
state schools. Longstanding resentment against central administration grew 
because of what her critics complained was Reynolds' autocratic style. Now, 
some professors hope for a purge of other officials at the Golden Shore 
headquarters, and sharp cuts in that office's budget. 
</P>
<P>
But others hope that Reynolds' removal and the rollback last week of the pay 
raises will appease legislators and taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get back to what we are doing, which is figuring out how to accommodate 
these many thousands of students and how to teach them and how to keep them in 
school," said a San Francisco State official, who asked not to be identified. 
"Those are the real questions and what we should concentrate on now instead of 
these tacky questions about the pay raises." 
</P>
<P>
Some officials are worried, however, about how well the system can function 
during the search for a new chancellor and whether campus presidents will have 
too free a hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The momentum of this large, old bureaucracy will probably keep on going 
through this transition. Students won't feel anything different," said Patrick 
Nichelson, president of the Cal State professors' union. He said that he hopes 
Reynolds' push for more minority students and teachers, widely recognized as 
one of her major successes, doesn't get lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of land for an educational center in Ventura will be allowed, 
but other plans for Cal State expansion will have to await a new chancellor, a 
delay of up to a year, Carter and others said. Also, a proposal for Cal State 
doctorate programs in education -- now allowed only in conjunction with a UC 
school -- appears to be a victim of Reynolds' fall. 
</P>
<P>
Another byproduct of the Reynolds controversy seems to be new assertiveness -- 
or at least, talk of it -- by the Cal State Board of Trustees, the panel 
appointed by the governor to oversee the university. In the past, trustees 
often rubber-stamped decisions of the chancellor. And in the wave of bad 
publicity for their part in the pay raises, trustees contend that they were 
misled by Reynolds' staff. They pledge never to let that happen again, going so 
far as to hire their own independent attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"The board has reached and passed its frustration point," said Trustee Lee A. 
Grissom of San Diego. "We have gone from being the least of aggressive boards 
to the most aggressive without changing one name."

<P>
REINER, SMITH IN TOUGH, LIVELY CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For more than a year, Democratic state attorney general hopeful Arlo Smith had 
been itching for a face-to-face, on-the-air confrontation with his better-known 
opponent, Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity finally arose when the candidates were hustled into a cramped 
radio booth recently after addressing a large anti-gang rally in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was, veteran KABC radio talk show host Michael Jackson failed to 
recognize Smith's face. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until Reiner departed after chatting for several minutes to the 
broadcast audience that the three-term San Francisco district attorney was even 
given a chance to introduce himself. 
</P>
<P>
"You came in and sat down and I didn't know who in Hades you were," an 
embarrassed Jackson told Smith. "You've got that face recognition to get 
across." 
</P>
<P>
With less than two months to go before the June Democratic primary, the 
incident underscores a central question in a race that political insiders once 
viewed as a cakewalk for Reiner, the two-term district attorney of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, aided by an aggressive campaigning style and by the recent acquittals in 
the McMartin Pre-School child molestation case, has finally managed to hoist 
himself onto the same playing field as the nationally visible prosecutor of 
vote-rich Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury is still out on whether Smith can translate his rising standing 
into the name-, face- and message-recognition necessary to pull off a primary 
election upset. 
</P>
<P>
The question remained unresolved after the recent state Democratic convention, 
in which neither candidate came close to garnering the 60% of the delegates' 
votes necessary for an endorsement. But Smith made eye-opening inroads by 
winning more votes than Reiner -- 47% to 44%. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's backers are hoping the showing will help him raise money to stage a 
critical advertising blitz during the final weeks of the campaign. Neither 
Smith nor Reiner -- who have engaged in a combative dialogue -- has begun his 
paid media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the two contenders, one of whom will face conservative Republican Dan 
Lungren in the November general election, have strong resumes to serve as the 
state's top law enforcement official. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, 54, has methodically ascended the rungs of local office in Los Angeles, 
winning terms as city controller and city attorney before being elected in 1984 
to head what is described as the largest local prosecution agency in the world. 
If elected attorney general, Reiner would follow in the footsteps of former Los 
Angeles prosecutors John K. Van de Kamp and Evelle Younger -- both of whom 
later ran for governor. 
</P>
<P>
For Smith, 62, a November victory would mean a return home. Before his 1979 
election as district attorney, Smith labored for 26 years in the attorney 
general's office, serving stints as chief assistant attorney general and as 
head of the office's criminal and trials sections. 
</P>
<P>
On key issues, the two Democrats espouse similar views. Both identify drug 
abuse and crime as the leading social problems facing the state. And both 
strongly favor the death penalty, abortion rights and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
With such similar philosophies, what are Smith and Reiner fighting about? 
Performance and personality -- with a prosecutor's zeal. 
</P>
<P>
In two debates that have resembled demolition derbies, Smith repeatedly 
questioned Reiner's integrity, while Reiner publicly pondered Smith's backbone. 
At the Democratic convention, the candidates' staffs nearly drowned delegates 
in leaflets containing such vociferous headlines as "Rising Above the Mud" and 
"A Response to the Hit Piece." 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, Reiner has been the target of the attacks, as his 
lesser-known opponent tries to define him in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
As the prosecutor of one of the nation's media capitals, the glare of publicity 
is nothing new to Reiner. In the last six years, his 900-attorney office has 
handled several of the nation's most notorious criminal cases and Reiner, for 
the most part, has been anything but camera shy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with his deep voice, halo of white hair and imposing stage presence, 
Reiner seems like the D.A. from Central Casting. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy has an incredible ability to get news attention. I can't tell you how 
many times I've seen him on 'Nightline,' " says Kam Kuwata, a Democratic 
campaign consultant who is not involved in the race. "He has the look of a 
political Dirty Harry." 
</P>
<P>
During Reiner's tenure, his deputies have won their share of high-profile 
cases, most notably the Night Stalker serial murder trial of Richard Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
But other nationally spotlighted cases have ended in acquittals or dismissal, 
among them: the "Twilight Zone" manslaughter trial of Hollywood film director 
John Landis, the campaign violations indictment of former U.S. Rep. Bobbi 
Fiedler (R-Northridge), and the McMartin case, now six years and running. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity can cut two ways and Reiner, who critics charge is more interested in 
headlines than results, acknowledges that his popularity slipped after the 
January acquittals of Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey. But Reiner, who has 
refiled a handful of molestation counts against Ray Buckey, declares that the 
tumble will prove temporary. 
</P>
<P>
Of overriding importance to voters, Reiner contends, is that he is an innovator 
while Smith functions, at best, as a lackluster office manager. 
</P>
<P>
Since winning election as district attorney, Reiner takes credit for sponsoring 
more than 50 anti-crime and pro-environment bills, a majority of which have 
been enacted by the Legislature. Among them is a law on street terrorism that 
subjects hard-core gang members to stiffer sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner also established the nation's first environmental strike force to 
prosecute toxic polluters and set up a worker safety unit that is on 24-hour 
call to investigate workplace deaths. His combined environmental/worker safety 
unit is staffed by 10 lawyers and nine investigators. The unit files about 50 
cases a year and sent 18 defendants to jail between 1987 and 1989. In contrast, 
Smith has one environmental attorney and has filed three cases in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing Smith of "prosecuting only the easiest cases," Reiner also cites 1988 
state statistics he says show that Smith filed charges in only 49% of felony 
arrests, compared to 64% for Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Smith counters that the prosecution statistics are skewed, in part because San 
Francisco police, unlike Los Angeles police, do not weed out cases before 
sending them to him for prosecution. Besides, Smith says, the San Francisco 
crime rate has dropped 27% during his tenure, compared to an 11% increase in 
Los Angeles since Reiner took office. 
</P>
<P>
As for his environmental record, Smith maintains that it is much stronger than 
Reiner would make it appear. While a deputy attorney general, Smith says, he 
brought the state's first price-fixing cases against the nation's major oil 
companies. His current effort is comparable to Reiner's, he says, since he has 
only one-ninth the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also points to several achievements during his tenure as district 
attorney, including a consumer fraud unit and a family violence project that he 
says has assisted more than 5,000 families through victim counseling and tough 
prosecution of offenders. 
</P>
<P>
To Smith, the difference between the candidates is that he is a career 
prosecutor while Reiner is a "job-hopping politician." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Reiner, Smith has maintained a relatively low-key presence while running 
his 100-attorney office -- so low-key that hometown columnists occasionally 
make fun of him for it. San Francisco Examiner columnist Bill Mandel once 
asserted that Smith "keeps a low profile that can be mistaken for quiet 
competence." 
</P>
<P>
In the current race, Smith has attempted to take advantage of his balding, 
bespectacled presence -- contrasting it to that of the media-savvy Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look like Robert Redford," he concludes in his stump speech. "And I 
don't always have a glib line or a 20-second sound bite to offer." 
</P>
<P>
At the lectern, Smith often fumbles over his words, gesticulating like a 
non-swimmer desperately seeking to reach shore -- or the next sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But as San Francisco public defender Jeff Brown cautions, appearances can be 
deceiving. "Arlo Smith is not an articulator, but one thing you should not 
underestimate is his intelligence. He has as shrewd a political mind as any in 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has already come out of nowhere once -- when he won his district 
attorney's job in 1979 by attacking the incumbent on his prosecution of Dan 
White, who received less than eight years in prison for assassinating Mayor 
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. 
</P>
<P>
During this campaign, Smith has again been on the attack. By now, it seems, he 
has accused Reiner of most everything but dyeing his hair white. 
</P>
<P>
Take their first debate last month. Before Smith had concluded his opening 
statement, he had already accused Reiner of squandering his integrity on cases 
ranging from McMartin to the Zsa Zsa Gabor cop-slapping imbroglio. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gabor case, he said, Reiner used the incident to attract publicity by 
demanding that the pugnacious actress be sentenced to 30 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
With McMartin, Smith castigated Reiner for his use of a tainted jailhouse 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
"The New York Times . . . referred to it as being, quote, desperate and 
sleazy," Smith said. "Those are not the words of a candidate, those are the 
words of editorial writers." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has also repeatedly criticized his opponent for being censured by the 
State Bar in 1986 for violating conflict-of-interest rules while serving as 
city attorney. The incident involved Reiner's speaking out against a secret Los 
Angeles Police Department intelligence unit while defending the city in a 
lawsuit alleging illegal spying by the unit. Reiner has defended himself, 
saying he had a higher duty to the public than to police who participated in 
wrongful behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Smith himself has come under attack lately for his handling of cases in which 
he has a peripheral personal interest. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, after an investigation by Smith's office, a grand jury 
indicted five men for allegedly hiding the source of donations aimed at 
defeating a ballot measure to build a baseball stadium in San Francisco. One of 
the men, political consultant Richard Schlackman, is distantly related to Smith 
by marriage and last year provided services to Smith's campaign. Schlackman's 
attorney argues that Smith threw the book at his client to make it appear that 
he's such a tough D.A. he'd prosecute a family member. 
</P>
<P>
And Smith, while criticizing Reiner on McMartin, has been called to task for a 
low rate of prosecutions on child molestation cases. In 1985, a coalition of 
professionals complained that his office won 15 convictions in a year that 
police received nearly 400 child molestation complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Although they agree outwardly on most issues, Smith and Reiner do have a 
handful of philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
Smith says that most gang members "aren't bad kids" and predicts that gangs 
would "ultimately deteriorate" if their leaders were systematically jailed. 
Reiner says that street gangs are leaderless packs whose individual members 
must be dealt with severely. 
</P>
<P>
And Reiner, unlike Smith, supports stiff fines for first-time drug offenders. 
Reiner says the current system of drug diversion constitutes de facto 
decriminalization. 
</P>
<P>
initial,2 
</P>
<P>
I n early polls, Smith -- as in 1979 -- was virtually unrecognized by voters. 
But the independent California Poll, released less than two weeks ago, showed 
Reiner with 28% to Smith's 24% -- a statistically insignificant difference, 
with 48% of voters yet to make up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's latest campaign finance statement shows that as of mid-March he had 
$426,000 on hand. Reiner, whose base of supporters includes private law firms, 
labor groups and the Hollywood entertainment community, has been endorsed by 
the Los Angeles County Chiefs of Police, the Police Protective League of Los 
Angeles and the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had $274,000 on hand in mid-March. He has received substantial aid from 
private attorneys and from deputy district attorneys who work for him. (Reiner 
refuses money from his subordinates; and Reiner's campaign manager, Sam Singer, 
has accused Smith of "twisting the arms of his employees.") Smith's main 
contributions have come from his wife and himself, lending $400,000 to the 
campaign thus far. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's endorsements include the Police Officers Research Assn. of California 
and the state chapter of the National Organization for Women PAC. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 days of broadcast time in the Los Angeles market alone costing upward 
of $500,000, it appears that both candidates will have to strictly limit their 
ad campaigns. In the meantime, they are expected to keep flogging away at each 
other, seeking as much free exposure as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Smith called a press conference outside the Southern California 
headquarters of the state Democratic Party -- a windowless bunker behind Lucy's 
El Adobe restaurant in Hollywood. When Smith's campaign manager, Marc Dann, was 
asked if his candidate planned to deliver his statement in front of the 
uninspiring structure, Dann delivered a succinct reply. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to go where the TV cameras tell us to, " he said. "After all, this 
is America."

CAL POLY FESTIVAL REVELERS RAMPAGE IN SAN LUIS OBISPO;

<P>
An annual spring festival at Cal Poly spawned a violent melee in the city 
streets Friday night and early Saturday as more than 1,000 revelers vandalized 
cars, homes and businesses before police used tear gas and high-pressure water 
hoses to disperse the mobs. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd hurled bricks, rocks and beer bottles at police, who called in 
reinforcements dressed in full riot gear from throughout San Luis Obispo and 
Santa Barbara counties. A dozen police officers were injured -- including one 
who suffered a broken arm and another who lost a tooth when he was hit in the 
face with a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty people, about half of them Cal Poly students, were booked at San Luis 
Obispo County Jail on suspicion of disturbing the peace, assaulting a police 
officer and other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The festival continued as planned Saturday night -- including a rodeo 
competition and a concert by the rock band Santana. Police, who had geared up 
for the possibility of another night of violence, said late Saturday that there 
were no major problems. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the violence that began Friday night included at least three 
outbursts and did not end until about 2 a.m. Saturday. Witnesses said roaming 
vandals caused widespread damage in a residential area on the north side of the 
city, with young people smashing car windows, tearing down street signs, 
climbing on roofs and urinating in public. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a crowd chanting "Free beer! Free beer!" smashed the windows of a 
liquor store and began tossing beer bottles into the store, while frightened 
employees pitched full champagne bottles back out the broken windows to keep 
the unruly crowd at bay. The shop owner said the police took 30 minutes to 
respond. Police acknowledged that they were busy trying to quell another 
rampage a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredibly chaotic," said senior Heather Wicka, who witnessed the scene 
from her front porch. "There were masses of people lined up. They were standing 
on cars, they were standing in the street. They were climbing telephone poles, 
street signs until they knocked all the street signs down. It was like a 
shark-feeding frenzy, just animal aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Said Michael Bronkey, a local radio disc jockey who happened upon the scene: 
"It was the most incredible thing I've ever seen. The police were chasing 
people, beating on people and everyone was screaming. I was just standing there 
in awe. It was a strange event, a strange night." 
</P>
<P>
The fracas has cast doubt upon the future of the Poly Royal Festival, a 
58-year-old campus tradition that draws upwards of 100,000 people to this 
central coast city of 41,000. 
</P>
<P>
University President Warren Baker said that he intends to bring administrators, 
faculty and students together to "look at the situation, evaluate what 
happened, why it happened, and the consequences for the future." 
</P>
<P>
In its early days, Poly Royal was billed as "a country fair on a college 
campus," according to one professor. On campus, it is sort of a gigantic 
show-and-tell in which students display their architectural, agricultural and 
engineering projects -- from homemade jams and cheeses to models of cities. 
</P>
<P>
But off campus in recent years, the festival has grown into a rowdy weekend of 
partying that has annoyed local citizens. "People are sick of it," said Ray 
Tippo, who teaches journalism at the school. 
</P>
<P>
During last year's Poly Royal, what police described as a "mini-riot" erupted 
in an off-campus student apartment complex. Police Lt. Ron Orback said that 
while that disturbance was not as severe as this weekend's, it was "a real 
mess," with hundreds of people hurling bottles off rooftops and "just raising 
heck." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been gradually getting worse over the last few years," said Sgt. Leon 
Cole of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Department. "I've had officers 
tell me that (Friday) night was about 10 times worse than last year." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last year's trouble, the university placed a heightened emphasis 
on the academic side of Poly Royal. In a statement released Saturday, student 
body President Ricardo Echeverria said: "The students of Cal Poly are very 
aware of the real intent of Poly Royal -- that of displaying the academic 
aspects of our campus. We, as students, have worked diligently for the past 
year to preserve and promote this theme." 
</P>
<P>
The statement, released jointly by the university administrators, the student 
government and Mayor Ron Dunin, praised the police response as "appropriate and 
measured." City officials blamed much of the problem on out-of-town visitors. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to know what sparked the disturbances Friday night, although 
Orback said, "the main problem is alcohol." In all, more than 80 law 
enforcement officers were called in to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the melee began at 10:30 p.m., when police and paramedics were 
rushing to get to a traffic accident just south of the campus. As paramedics 
tried to assist the victim, revelers began throwing things at them. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 officers tried to clear the scene. But before they could finish, they 
were called off to another disturbance several blocks away. "They were met with 
a barrage of bricks, rocks, pieces of tile, street signs and other items," 
according to a police statement. 
</P>
<P>
Using loudspeakers, the officers tried to persuade the crowd to disperse. Then, 
according to freshman Heath Patton, they got creative: "The cops started 
blaring on the p.a. system, 'Assault on police officers will not look good on 
your resume!' " 
</P>
<P>
The riot did not break up until the police resorted to spraying the crowd with 
water and tear gas. Meanwhile, at yet a third site, John Martin, owner of the 
Campus Bottle liquor store, had already shut down his business -- four hours 
earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd was too big outside and it was getting to where I couldn't control 
the number of people coming in," he said. "So we closed up, hoping they would 
have all gone away and cleared out." 
</P>
<P>
But the revelers demanded more beer. They smashed his windows with a stop sign. 
Soon, the "bottle war," as one spectator called it, was under way. "We were 
exchanging projectiles," said Martin, adding that he and his employees were 
afraid to leave the store. "We didn't have any place to go. The building was 
surrounded." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the police came. When it was over, a truck drove by, its large 
headlights illuminating the street. 
</P>
<P>
"What you could see was the glittering of glass," said Wicka, the student who 
had watched from her porch. "The street was actually wet from alcohol, from 
beer. And the gutters, all of them were filled up to curb level on both sides 
with glass and cans."

Tens of thousands of mourners crowded rain-drenched Bogota streets Saturday for 
a funeral march honoring assassinated presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro 
Leongomez, a guerrilla chieftain who became a champion of peace.

Pizarro's leftist political movement, the Democratic Alliance M-19, announced

A young man firing a machine pistol killed Pizarro, 38, aboard an airborne 
jetliner Thursday. The assassination was the latest killing in a long wave of 
terrorist violence that has engulfed Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine traffickers based in the city of Medellin have carried out many 
killings and bombings, while right-wing death squads and leftist terrorists 
have been blamed for others. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Oscar Pelaez, chief of judicial police, identified Pizarro's assassin as 
Gerardo Gutierrez Uribe, 20, who had worked for a billiards chalk factory near 
Medellin. Pelaez said the factory was linked to the Medellin cartel, headed by 
Pablo Escobar Gavira, Colombia's most notorious drug lord. 
</P>
<P>
"The one responsible for the death of Carlos Pizarro Leongomez has a name: 
Pablo Escobar Gavira," Pelaez told reporters. A statement issued Friday by 
anonymous traffickers, believed to include Escobar, denied any responsibility 
for the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
Police also have blamed Escobar for the assassinations of presidential 
candidates Luis Carlos Galan in August and Bernardo Jaramillo in March. 
Investigative documents in court files, however, have not implicated Escobar in 
any of the killings, the newspaper El Espectador reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholic Bishop Guillermo Vega, chairman of the church's Justice and 
Peace Commission, officiated at Saturday's funeral Mass for Pizarro. "Nobody 
spoke against violence as he did in recent days," the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
As Pizarro's coffin emerged from the cathedral on Bogota's central Plaza 
Bolivar, a waiting crowd clapped and began chanting, "The government killed 
him." The chant echoed widespread outrage over the government's failure to 
prevent terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
But a member of the M-19 who was helping with crowd control said the chant did 
not reflect the political movement's official position. "We make no 
accusations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Draped with a red, yellow and blue Colombian flag, the coffin was placed atop a 
black hearse parked beside the empty site once occupied by Colombia's Palace of 
Justice. About 40 M-19 guerrillas took over the judicial center in November, 
1985, and all were killed in an army counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven Supreme Court justices and about 50 other people also died in the 
besieged building, which was gutted by fire. 
</P>
<P>
Under heavy rain at midday Saturday, Pizarro's funeral hearse moved slowly 
through crowded streets, followed by a long procession of marchers. Radio RCN 
estimated the total number of mourners on the streets at 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The procession, which took five hours to reach the National Cemetery where 
Pizarro's body was buried, stopped at the historic Quinta Bolivar, an estate 
used by South American independence hero Simon Bolivar. Guerrillas stole 
Bolivar's sword from the estate's museum in 1974 to announce the M-19's 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
M-19 stands for April 19 Movement. That is the date of allegedly fraudulent 
presidential elections in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
At the estate Saturday, the M-19 proclaimed former guerrilla Antonio Navarro 
Wolf as Pizarro's successor in the presidential campaign. "I accept so that 
there may be peace in Colombia," said Navarro, who lost a leg in a June, 1985, 
grenade attack against him at a restaurant in the city of Cali. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Navarro was the M-19's chief negotiator in peace talks with the 
government. The M-19 withdrew from the talks shortly after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Pizarro led the guerrilla movement into new peace talks last year that 
culminated when the rebels gave up their arms and entered the political arena 
in March. In recent opinion surveys, Pizarro was favored by about 5% of voters 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
Pizarro's widow, Laura, said at graveside services Saturday that he was brave 
in battle and equally brave in making peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us not let all his efforts be in vain," she said. "Let us not lose hope, 
and let us continue opening paths to peace for our country."

MEXICO TO SEEK WARRANTS IN SUSPECT'S KIDNAPING

The Mexican government said late Saturday that it would seek the extradition of 
Americans and Mexican citizens in the United States who "executed, planned or 
organized" the kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor accused in the 1985 murder of 
a U.S. drug agent. 
</P>
<P>
The bulletin from the Mexican Foreign Ministry did not say how many people the 
government sought, nor did it identify them. But on Friday, Mexico's attorney 
general had said he would issue an arrest warrant for Antonio Garate 
Bustamante, a Los Angeles-based Drug Enforcement Administration operative who 
has admitted to arranging the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Garate, a former Mexican police officer, told The Times in an interview last 
week that he arranged to have Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain abducted in 
Guadalajara on April 2 and delivered the following day to Los Angeles-based DEA 
agents waiting in El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Garate asserted that the clandestine operation, dubbed "Wild Geese," was 
approved by DEA agent Hector Berellez. Berellez heads Operation Leyenda, the 
investigation into the torture and murder of drug agent Enrique S. Camarena in 
Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican government will immediately initiate proceedings to request the 
extradition of the people, be they nationals or foreigners, who have 
participated in the execution, planning or organization of the kidnaping," the 
bulletin said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo has not placed blame for the 
kidnaping on the DEA. It is not clear whether Mexico would request the 
extradition of any DEA officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry bulletin says that further cooperation between Mexico and 
the DEA will continue "only insofar as an agreement can be reached on new rules 
of cooperation and exchange of information . . . " and that the number of DEA 
agents in Mexico will be "limited." 
</P>
<P>
It states that the Mexican government has not received a response to its April 
17 diplomatic note delivered in Washington requesting clarification of the 
Alvarez case. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican federal police have arrested six people in connection with the 
kidnaping, including two Guanajuato state police officers and a former federal 
police commander.

Ten Mongolian opposition party members were arrested after a series of illegal 
protest rallies against the government, residents said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The apprehensions were the first known arrests of opposition party members 
since the birth of the pro-democracy movement last December. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of those arrested was sentenced to 25 days' detention. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 are members of the largest opposition group, the Mongolian Democratic 
Assn., which held rallies Friday in the northern province of Hovsogol and in 
the capital, Ulan Bator, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
They said Friday's rally in central Ulan Bator attracted 10,000 people. Unarmed 
troops were called in for the first time since December, but the demonstration 
passed peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the arrests showed that the Communists, in power since 1921, are 
tightening their grip in Mongolia, where mass protests forced the governing 
party to renounce its monopoly on power in March and call the country's first 
free general elections.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Syrian President Hafez Assad said 
Saturday that U.S. policies are a major obstacle to peace in the Middle East, 
Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, after three hours of private talks, also expressed serious 
concern at what they said was the "problem of the possession of nuclear weapons 
by Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Tass said Gorbachev rejected "inventions" circulating in some Arab countries 
that Moscow has a secret deal with Washington on Jewish emigration from the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Assad agreed that prospects for a solution to Middle East 
problems and the holding of an international conference are being held back by 
the position of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said both leaders believe that the stand of the Bush Administration is 
"even worse" than that of the Ronald Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result there is still no stimulus for the Israeli leadership to seek a 
real way out of the blind alley, and it is behaving aggressively and in a 
challenging fashion," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Assad raised the issue of emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel, which many Arab 
countries argue is helping Israel tighten its grip on occupied Arab land by 
allowing the establishment of new settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the increased migration is linked to "internal processes in the 
Soviet Union, with certain undesirable phenomena in inter-ethnic relations." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently quoting Gorbachev, Tass said problems caused by Jewish emigration 
must be solved in the context "of the rights of the Arabs and not just of human 
rights in general." 
</P>
<P>
In resisting Arab calls to ban further emigration until now, Moscow has argued 
that its international commitments on human rights make it impossible for it to 
prevent Jews leaving for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Tass report on the talks said the two presidents also discussed cooperation 
in the modernization of Syria's armed forces -- largely supplied with Soviet 
weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
At separate talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh, Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Israel has not matched the goodwill shown 
by Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said Moscow wants closer contact with Arab states regarding Israel's 
"illegal activities" in settling Jewish immigrants and wants the United Nations 
Security Council to take a stand against "the colonization of these lands."

A man who sued his ex-wife for half of her $31.5-million Florida Lotto jackpot 
is entitled to 25% of her winnings for his role in buying the ticket, a jury 
decided Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Snipes, a mechanic who claimed he helped pick the six winning numbers and 
had agreed to share the winnings before purchasing the ticket in October, 1988, 
rejected his former wife's offer of $1 million before filing the suit. 
</P>
<P>
One fourth of $31.5 million works out to roughly $7,875,000. Attorneys for Mrs. 
Snipes, who said they would appeal the verdict, noted that lawyers for both 
sides would have to meet to determine the exact cash amount. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated for 2 1/2 hours before ruling that while Mary Ellen Snipes 
was the true owner of the ticket, the couple had arranged to share the winnings 
and that Snipes was entitled to the one-fourth share. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's marriage ended in 1982, but Snipes kept in touch and occasionally 
paid part of his ex-wife's rent and mowed her lawn.

Hawaii's humpback whales, known for their lively stunts and haunting songs, 
attract people from around the world. But the feeling doesn't seem to be 
mutual. 
</P>
<P>
As jet skis and motorboats crowd the west Maui coastline, the humpbacks seem to 
be leaving the balmy near-shore waters they once favored as calving grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like having chain saws in your nursery," says Mark Ferrari, executive 
director of the Maui-based Center for Whale Studies, which has documented a 
precipitous decline in cow-calf sightings off Lahaina over the last decade. "It 
keeps you from going in there." 
</P>
<P>
With whale watching gaining popularity around the country, one question keeps 
surfacing: From a whale's point of view, how close is too close for comfort? 
</P>
<P>
The debate divides scientists and has hampered efforts to protect the mammoth 
mammals from their fast-growing human fan club. But a federal agency may settle 
the matter this summer by guaranteeing whales 100 yards of privacy wherever 
they roam in U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
The protective zone already applies in Hawaiian waters. Only scientists with 
federal research permits are allowed to get closer to the humpbacks, which 
migrate here from Alaska for winter and spring. Along coastal stretches of Maui 
and Lanai favored by mothers and calves, the minimum distance is 300 yards. 
Aircraft may approach no closer than 1,000 feet. Violators are typically fined 
from $400 to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
The set-back regulation was imposed in Hawaii in December, 1987, by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service out of concern that people were inadvertently 
pushing the humpbacks from vital breeding grounds. The boisterous beasts are 
among the world's most endangered whales, with a population estimated at 1,500 
to 2,000 in the North Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Like all whales, the humpbacks depend heavily on their acoustic sense and are 
sensitive to noise. When boats approach, studies show that whales may stay 
underwater longer, change breathing patterns and direction and have difficulty 
communicating. "They are wild animals and they need space," says Gene Witham, 
enforcement agent in the Fisheries Service Honolulu office. "These whales were 
hunted up until 1966 in the Pacific. It's very possible that some of the adults 
can remember." 
</P>
<P>
The agency is poised to extend the 100-yard rule nationwide, although it may 
grant a few exceptions, according to Margaret Lorenz, marine resources 
management specialist at National Marine Fisheries Service headquarters in 
Washington, D.C. The move would unify widely varying regional guidelines and 
give them the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
That could mean big changes for some whale watch operators and other boaters 
around the country. In California, the guidelines now set no minimum distance, 
but simply recommend how to handle vessels within 100 yards of a whale. In New 
England, they allow boats to get as close as 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Fletcher, president of the San Diego-based Sportfishing Assn. of 
California, which includes whale watching, says his members consider the 
100-yard setback a "reasonable compromise as long as enforcement agents use 
common sense." Under the regulation, if a whale approaches a boat, rather than 
vice versa, the operator would not be cited. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposal alarms some commercial whale watchers in Massachusetts and a 
few on the West Coast. They consider themselves a key force in educating the 
public about whales and argue that the new rule could undercut that goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would eliminate whale watching," says Ronn Storro-Patterson, whose 
McKinleyville-based company, Biological Journeys, runs whale tours along the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"From 100 yards, we don't see a whole lot. If that's the way whale watching is 
going to be regulated, I don't think people are going to spend the money." 
</P>
<P>
Critics also point out that imposing a blanket distance ignores the fact that 
whales react differently to disturbances and that boats emit various levels of 
noise. But taking such variations into account would be a regulatory nightmare, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
While Lorenz acknowledges that 100 yards is "somewhat arbitrary," she says 
simplicity is the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have something we can enforce," she said. "A hundred yards is an 
easy distance for people to measure. It's like a football field." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the only recourse for enforcement agents has been to prosecute 
people under the Endangered Species Act. To do so, they must prove that a whale 
has been harassed, a tough standard to meet because it is so subjective. 
</P>
<P>
The fisheries service plans to publish the proposed rule this summer, and allow 
60 days of public comment before it is made final. "We expect a bloody fight," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such concerns, the 100-yard rule went over without a splash in Hawaii, 
where whale watch operators carry an estimated 100,000 passengers a year. 
</P>
<P>
Lahaina, once a support base for commercial whaling, now is a magnet for 
tourists enchanted by the acrobatic humpbacks. The animals delight onlookers by 
thrusting their 40-ton bodies skyward and slapping the waves with their long 
pectoral fins. Some boats use hydrophones to amplify the humpbacks' complex 
songs, which can last 20 minutes before repeating. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't squawk about the setback," says Mike Salzer, vice president of 
Ocean Activities Center, one of Maui's largest whale watch operators. "It 
hasn't affected our whale watching at all. We've always given the whale plenty 
of berth." 
</P>
<P>
Most violators have been private boaters. Last year, an Austrian was fined 
$1,500 for gunning his Zodiac repeatedly at a pod of humpbacks. The publicity 
over that and other cases has helped discourage potential violators, according 
to Witham. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials are now ready to take whale protection a step further. The 
Hawaii Legislature is considering a ban on jet skis and parasails in west Maui 
waters during the December-May whale season. Legislators contend that the 
noisy, erratic behavior of the "thrill craft" disturbs whales, not to mention 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Researcher Ferrari supports the thrill craft ban. He remembers identifying a 
calf that was playing happily, then seeing it a week later with a propeller 
scar down its dorsal fin and the top of its right pectoral fin chopped off. 
</P>
<P>
"It obviously had been run over by a boat," he said, noting that parasail boats 
have unprotected propellers 
</P>
<P>
Calves that have had such run-ins are likely to die at the hands of predators, 
he said. And whether or not whales are hit directly, the loss of near-shore 
habitat where mothers rest and nurse their young hurts the species' chances for 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
"The whales don't come down here so we can look at them," said state Rep. 
Rosalyn Baker, who represents west Maui. "They come down here to regenerate 
their species. It's very important that their activities not be interrupted if 
we're serious about protecting them."

The panic began when federal judge Douglas H. Ginsburg asked President Ronald 
Reagan in 1987 to withdraw his nomination to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg's admission that he, like many in his generation, had smoked marijuana 
"on a few occasions" derailed his career. And that in turn sent shudders 
through politically ambitious members of the thirtysomething generation. The 
legacy of drug use in the 1960s and 1970s, they feared, would be a a 
generational bloodletting in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue's over," an influential -- and generationally vulnerable -- Senate 
staff member said recently with a noticeable sense of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Young appointees in the Administration still worry at times, said one senior 
official, also in his 30s. "You do hear chatter around the Administration about 
the wisdom of answering questions" about drug use, he said. But the answers 
"apparently do not appear to be a barrier."

White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray said drug use has caused the Administration 
to disqualify some prospective appointees. But a "substantial" percentage of 
Administration nominees had once used drugs, he said. Among them, other 
officials said, are at least two federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusually short period, said Republican political consultant Roger Stone, 
the rules of the political game have changed. Although public attitudes about 
current drug use are rapidly hardening, the mood about past use has become more 
forgiving. The result, said Stone, "is a triumph of generational politics." 
</P>
<P>
Two recent developments, one in Washington and one in Texas, underscore the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
The first involved T. Timothy Ryan Jr., the Bush Administration's nominee to 
head the government's savings and loan bailout program. When a so-far 
unidentified senator leaked confidential FBI reports showing Ryan had used 
drugs in the past, the nomination, already vulnerable for other reasons, 
appeared headed for deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the drug issue became a non-issue. No one in the Senate raised it, and 
Ryan was confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan," Gray said, "has done a service, although a painful one, in solidifying 
the change" in how past drug use is handled by the political system. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, many politicians thought allegations that state Treasurer Ann 
Richards had used drugs would doom her campaign for governor. Instead, the 
allegations, which were unsubstantiated, seemed to backfire against Jim Mattox, 
the state attorney general, who opposed her in the Democratic gubernatorial 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Richards beat Mattox on April 10 with 57% of the vote, and Mattox told 
reporters that he had apparently overestimated how much voters would care about 
the drug issue. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the predicted conflict never break out? In part, officials and 
pollsters say, the public never worried as much about a person's past drug use 
as politicians had thought. In part, too, as Stone noted, the political 
influence of the baby boom generation has grown more rapidly than some 
political strategists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
But, at least as far as federal appointments go, part of the credit appears to 
go to adroit management of a difficult issue by Bush and his aides. At least in 
this area, Bush seems to have succeeded in making the Washington debate a 
little "kinder and gentler." 
</P>
<P>
The effort, Gray said, started during the transition period immediately after 
Bush's election in 1988. Bush, Gray, Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and 
personnel chief Charles G. Untermeyer met and discussed how to avoid having 
nominations meet Ginsburg's fate. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the attention are not hard to see. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agencies by and large are headed by people in their 50s or 60s, but the 
next layer of the bureaucracy is typically almost a generation younger. In 
their 30s and early 40s, these men and women are looking for a few years of 
government service before returning to private life. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, that means the baby boom generation. And that often means drug use. 
</P>
<P>
From the the late 1960s to the early 1980s, illegal drugs were omnipresent on 
the nation's college campuses. Estimates vary, but at minimum, some 30 million 
to 40 million members of the baby boom generation -- half or more of the total 
-- admit in government surveys to having smoked marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration, at least in its rhetoric, took a hard line. Senior 
officials in several departments flatly ruled out hiring any person who 
admitted to having used an illegal drug in the past. 
</P>
<P>
That policy was easier to enforce at the time because an ambiguously worded 
question on the standard FBI background questionnaire, asking whether a person 
had a "problem" with drugs, allowed job seekers to hide past use without lying. 
During his FBI background check, for example, Ginsburg did not disclose his 
past use of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
But after the controversy over Ginsburg's nomination, the FBI tightened its 
procedures, requiring both sides to confront the issue head on. Prospective 
nominees now are asked to tell whether they have taken any illegal drug since 
the age of 18 and whether they have done so during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
As one senior Bush Administration official in his mid-30s put it: "A lot of 
people can answer no" to the question about recent drug use. The other question 
"requires most people to give a more complicated answer. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell you prior to your giving any answer that the best policy is to be 
honest" and that declining to answer would simply raise more questions, the 
official said. "The most popular formulation is: 'I tried it in college.' " 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Gray said, the Bush Administration adopted two policies: 
avoid any "hard-and-fast rule" about whether past drug use would disqualify a 
potential nominee, and avoid any public statements that would "raise 
expectations" about creating an Administration untouched by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't pass or fail on this drug issue," said another official involved in 
the process. "We agreed it would not be a hard-nosed policy but would be 
decided one by one, on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Gray's office reviews all presidential appointees and their FBI background 
checks. If a case is "close to the line," Gray said, he 
</P>
<P>
reviews it personally. If the call is very close or if, as in Ryan's case, the 
nomination is politically sensitive, Bush makes the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Gray declined to say exactly what would be considered "close to the line." But 
several Administration officials in their 30s said they had been appointed 
after revealing they had been recreational users of marijuana and experimented 
with cocaine while in college. 
</P>
<P>
Bush set the Administration's tone early, calling in his inaugural address for 
a "greater tolerance, an easy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
He has hewed to that line. The day of the Texas primary, for example, Bush was 
asked if he thought past marijuana use should disqualify a person for high 
office. He flatly said no. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is not the only Administration official to publicly urge tolerance. 
Another is drug policy chief William J. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
As Reagan's education secretary, Bennett sealed Ginsburg's fate by publicly 
calling on him to withdraw after his drug use was revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Bennett has adopted a different rhetorical stand. "Bill Bennett's view is 
essentially that (the 1960s and '70s) was then and this is now," said Deputy 
Chief of Staff David Tell. "Past drug use is not a good thing -- not to be 
smiled on or celebrated -- but there is redemption." 
</P>
<P>
One official in Bennett's office is a recovered cocaine addict who described 
her addiction several years ago in Washingtonian magazine. An aide to Bennett 
confirmed that the drug czar knew of the woman's history when she was hired. 
</P>
<P>
The change since the Reagan era reflects a difference in the Administrations, 
noted one official who served in both. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reagan Administration and its cadres were different kinds of people" from 
those who surround Bush, he said. The contrast, he added, has less to do with 
official policy than with the passing of the aggressive conservatism preached 
by many Reagan appointees. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were people who didn't take drugs," the official said of his Reagan-era 
colleagues. "The Bush Administration is a different kind of animal -- not 
sloppy or bohemian, but at least somewhat cosmopolitan." 
</P>
<P>
The change also reflects a difference in the mood of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Voters can put this stuff in much better perspective than politicians," said 
Harrison Hickman, a Democratic political consultant who worked on Richards' 
campaign. "Particularly now, when you have people in the mainstream of our 
society who have first-hand experience" as drug users themselves or friends of 
drug users. "They know you don't permanently foam at the mouth because you 
smoked marijuana once," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman's polls for Richards showed that roughly 70% of voters "almost from the 
beginning" said they were simply not concerned either that Richards, who has 
admitted to being a recovering alcoholic, might have used drugs in the past or 
that she refused to answer questions about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Republican consultant Stone agreed. "Younger voters," who have more direct 
experience with drugs, "are more tolerant," at least of past use, he said. And 
"younger voters are becoming a more dominant part of the electorate. . . . The 
problem is solving itself."

Two Navy pilots were plucked safely from the ocean and two of their crewmen 
awaiting help in a life raft were rescued after a Sea King helicopter plunged 
into the ocean southwest of San Diego during military exercises, authorities 
said. Navy officials said the Sikorsky SH-3 helicopter with four men aboard 
crashed about 11:30 p.m. Friday, 86 miles offshore and about 10 miles from the 
aircraft carrier it had been assisting. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time we learned the aircraft was in the water until the time we got 
them back to the ship was about 45 minutes," said Cmdr. Bob Pritchard. The 
pilots, Lt. Cmdr. Leroy Mills and Lt. Walter Beck, were fished out of the calm 
but chilly waters, and Petty Officer Charles Marcus and Airman Dale Brandt were 
found in a raft at the crash site by two rescue helicopters dispatched from the 
carrier Ranger. No one was injured, although the men were treated for mild 
hypothermia. The cause of the crash is under investigation.

Former state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, who was sentenced last week to 6 1/2 years 
in prison for political corruption, has been subpoenaed to testify before a 
federal grand jury investigating similar crimes. Montoya received a subpoena 
shortly after he was sentenced Thursday, according to unnamed sources cited in 
the San Francisco Chronicle. Montoya, who said he plans to appeal his 
conviction, is scheduled to begin his sentence June 29 at the low-security 
federal prison in Lompoc.

A coalition of major Kern County growers and grass-roots environmentalists, 
worried about public health and declining crop yield, has asked the state Air 
Resources Board to impose a moratorium on any new power-producing cogeneration 
plants in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Marcie Williams, head of the Visalia-based Citizens for a Healthy Environment, 
said the plants are "unnecessarily polluting our air because we don't need the 
energy. The smog is already harming our health." More than 50 cogeneration 
plants, burning everything from agricultural wastes to fossil fuels, are now in 
operation in the valley, and dozens more have been proposed. A bitterly opposed 
coal-burning power plant is near completion in Kings County and two more are 
proposed for Fresno County.

Inspectors found toppled chimneys and minor structural cracks Saturday in an 
area on the east side of San Francisco Bay rocked by two moderate earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The jolts, which struck along the southern end of the small Concord fault 
Friday night, measured 4.6 and 4.3 and were followed by several smaller 
temblors, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. USGS geologist Rick Lester 
said the quakes were considered aftershocks from a similar jolt April 6, which 
has been followed by a swarm of about 300 tiny temblors. "This could go on for 
a couple of weeks or stop abruptly," said Lester, adding that a similar 
sequence in the area in 1970 lasted for several months.

RANDY LEWIS: THE SUDDEN DEATH OF THE LIVE ALBUM: WHO PULLED THE PLUG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The James Harman Band's new "Strictly Live . . . in '85! Vol. 1" album has 
sparked many glowing memories for me, having seen the band countless times 
during that period, when it was one of the most consistently inspired and 
inspiring groups on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond that, the record -- on tiny, Orange-based Rivera Records -- also 
points up the specialcharms of a once-great, now-vanishing music-industry 
species: the live album itself. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the live album? Back in the dark, distant Vinyl Age, you could pick up 
Billboard's Top 100 album chart and always find a handful of live recordings 
among the top sellers. Just about any rock fan over 10 can name a cherished 
live album by a favorite act, and start rhapsodizing about how remarkable that 
show/tour was. 
</P>
<P>
From the unadulterated rock 'n' roll passion of Jerry Lee Lewis' "The Greatest 
Live Show on Earth" to the nuclear power of the Who's "Live at Leeds" to the 
frayed nerves exposed on Neil Young's "Time Fades Away," the best live albums 
have captured facets of the rock greats that were impossible to unlock within 
the confines of the studio. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last few years, pop concert recordings have become as few and far 
between as courteous drivers on the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"That's definitely right," agreed Billboard chart analyst Paul Grein. The 
popularity of the live album, Grein said, "peaked in about '78, when it was 
very common to have double live albums in the Top 10 and 20." 
</P>
<P>
That was the era when, for however short a time, Peter Frampton's "Frampton 
Comes Alive" reigned as the biggest-selling album of all time, racking up 
astonishing pre-"Thriller" sales of some 8 million copies. Nowadays, Grein 
says, the live album "isn't competely dead, but I'm surprised when any of them 
reach the top regions of the chart." 
</P>
<P>
Other than Bruce Springsteen's monumental five-record live set from 1986, which 
held the No. 1 spot for seven weeks, and U2's "Rattle and Hum" double live 
album from 1988, it's hard to think of any live albums in the last five years 
that have had any major impact on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
So, in what well may be one of those chicken-egg dichotomies, major record 
companies are releasing fewer and fewer live sets. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why -- ask Billy Joel," said Bob Merlis, publicity director for 
Warner Bros. Records. Joel "is the biggest record-seller in world," Merlis 
noted, "but his 'Live in the Soviet Union' album didn't do nearly what his 
record company (Warner rival Columbia Records) hoped. I guess people want live 
live -- they don't want live on record. Maybe the live record has been 
supplanted by the long-form video." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the advent and proliferation of video music in the form of MTV, concert 
videos and cable television specials has been mentioned as one major reason why 
rock fans are less enthralled with live albums these days. If you can see your 
favorite group as well as hear it at any time of the day or night, why bother 
with just listening to an old concert? 
</P>
<P>
In any case, making live albums is "not something we would encourage an artist 
to do," Merlis said. "It also takes up time that a new legitimate album would 
occupy in the space of a career. Why fritter it away on something you've 
already done?" 
</P>
<P>
That might be true in most cases. A few artists, however, have used the live 
setting to introduce new material. In fact, Frampton's famous example featured 
songs mostly unfamiliar to his core audience. Emmylou Harris created one of the 
best albums in her distinguished career with "Last Date," a collection of tunes 
she'd never recorded. And John Cale turned in some great moments with his 
"Sabotage Live" album, which featured all new material. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a darker explanation why the live album has all but become 
extinct: Perfection-happy rock fans no longer may be willing to tolerate the 
mistakes or, more to the point, the unpredictability of the live music-making 
process. Because so many of today's hit records are created and performed on 
programmable synthesizers and digital sequencers, which can play back one 
musically identical performance after another at the touch of a button, a 
"live" performance can sound so close to the "studio" version that you'd need a 
spectrum frequency analyzer, not a music critic, to judge the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Audiences have come to expect that -- they kind of want it," Merlis 
acknowledged. "If they want to hear an artist's old material, they want to hear 
it the way they are accustomed to hearing it, hence the rise of the boxed-set 
retrospectives." 
</P>
<P>
But oh, what we would have missed if this had always been the mind-set. No Bob 
Dylan screaming "You go your way and I'll go mine!!!" with the Band on "Before 
the Flood." No Van Morrison pulling the heart and soul out of "Tura Lura Lural" 
at the "Last Waltz" concert. No Eric Clapton searing his guitar strings on 
"Crossroads" from Cream's "Wheels of Fire." No B.B. King rhapsodizing about his 
"sweet li'l angel" from his timeless "Live at the Regal" album. 
</P>
<P>
If we try to eliminate all the variables that come with the live setting, we 
run the risk of losing those unique moments when music rises above the 
expected, beyond the predictable. As Harman says in the liner notes to his new 
album, "It's all here, everything a live recording needs . . . feedback, stuff 
falling down, people talking and yelling, (guitarist Hollywood) Fats' noisy 
volume control, three guys playing harmonica in the front row, bartenders 
ringing bells and my favorite . . . some would-be percussionist clanking 
glasses or ashtrays together -- out of time -- all the way through the slow 
blues." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, sometimes it's messy, and it's never perfect. But that's life.

FEW VIET EXILES FIND U.S.RICHES; 
</P>
<P>
REFUGEES HAVE FORGED AN ENDURING STEREOTYPE OF ECONOMIC AND INTELLECTUAL 
OVERACHIEVEMENT. BUT MOST LIVE IN POVERTY, WITH SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE AND 
CULTURAL HANDICAPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen years after the fall of Saigon, which triggered an exodus of more than 
1 million refugees, Vietnamese in the United States are still suffering from 
the legacy of defeat and the pain of exile. 
</P>
<P>
They are a diverse people whose ranks include former generals and former 
peasants, spies and schoolteachers, physicians and re-education camp prisoners, 
fishermen and air traffic controllers. They have brought to America the 
vitality and the scars, the ambitions and the deep divisions of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
A few have become millionaires. Many more have earned doctorates, forging a 
stereotype of economic and intellectual overachievement. Yet this image is 
largely based on those who fled South Vietnam just before or shortly after 
Saigon surrendered on April 30, 1975: the nation's Westernized, highly educated 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most Vietnamese refugees in the United States today live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Most arrived after 1978 with significant language, cultural and educational 
handicaps. Many remain dependent on welfare, stuck in minimum-wage jobs or 
consigned to an exploitative underground economy. Last year, refugee 
unemployment was twice the national average. 
</P>
<P>
The gap is glaring in Orange County, home to Little Saigon, the nation's 
largest Vietnamese community. Among the 100,000 people who have flocked to the 
neighborhoods along Bolsa Avenue are such wealthy exiles as former Premier 
Nguyen Cao Ky -- and thousands of refugees on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Tuong Duy Nguyen, executive director of Vietnamese Community of Orange County 
Inc., a social service agency, said: "Americans drive by Bolsa Avenue, and it's 
so thriving, so prosperous, that that's their image of Vietnamese refugees. 
It's not true. Most refugees are still living under the poverty line." 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years, Vietnamese-Americans of all backgrounds continue to describe 
themselves as refugees, not immigrants. And many say they are homesick. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our people have a hidden depression," said Garden Grove businessman 
Phong Duc Tran. "We were uprooted suddenly from our country and had to come 
here. The Koreans, the Japanese, they planned for years to come here; they 
wanted to come here. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the collapse of Saigon, though widely predicted, came much more 
suddenly than most South Vietnamese dreamed. Of the 1975 arrivals, 61% had less 
than 24 hours to prepare to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Tales of well-connected South Vietnamese scrambling aboard U.S. helicopters in 
1975 with suitcases stuffed with gold are probably exaggerated. Though some did 
take family jewelry or gold, their only portable asset, many more fled with 
nothing but their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
What the first refugees did bring, however, was education, class and 
connections. Sociologists quickly discovered that the 130,000 refugees who fled 
in 1975 tended to be well-to-do (more than 40%, for example, had owned 
automobiles in Vietnam) and Westernized. Many had studied abroad or had U.S. 
friends who helped them get settled. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, the 1975 arrivals were far better educated than their 
countrymen. Forty-eight percent had university degrees, whereas less than 1% of 
the Vietnamese population as a whole did. And three-quarters spoke at least 
some English. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with these advantages -- and an outpouring of sympathy from the U.S. 
public, which has not been sustained -- the first Vietnamese adjusted 
relatively quickly. Though many worked painful stints as janitors and 
dishwashers, most soon landed middle-class jobs. Men and women worked day and 
night, shared housing and pooled their earnings. By the early 1980s, federal 
tax returns show, household income of the 1975 arrivals had equaled the U.S. 
average. Many of their children were valedictorians. 
</P>
<P>
But such refugees account for roughly one-third of the Vietnamese population 
now in the United States. The others have less education, less upward mobility 
and less hope -- characteristics that prompted one scholar to compare them to 
the permanent U.S. underclass. 
</P>
<P>
In California, where more than 40% of Southeast Asian refugees have settled, 
more than half were still dependent on welfare in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some tremendous successes, and tremendous failures as well," said 
Walter Barnes, chief of refugee and immigration programs for the California 
Department of Social Services. "In the middle of that lies a bunch of people 
who are trying to do their best." 
</P>
<P>
The later arrivals tended to be young, rural people who spoke little English 
and had few skills of value in the West. For example, a survey of Southeast 
Asians in San Diego County found that the average 1975 arrival was a high 
school graduate but that the average 1980 arrival had not completed sixth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
These later "boat people" included Vietnamese who saw no reason to flee their 
Communist countrymen in 1975, then changed their minds; ethnic Chinese who were 
pushed out of Vietnam by the new regime; young Vietnamese men fleeing 
conscription into the wars against China and Cambodia; Cambodian survivors of 
the killing fields, and Laotians, including Hmong and other hill tribes. 
</P>
<P>
They had survived not only war, but often prison camp, persecution, genocide, 
rape by Thai pirates and the numbing degradation of refugee camps. Nearly half 
a million entered the United States in 1979-82. 
</P>
<P>
"They arrived en masse, overwhelming existing resettlement programs," said 
Ruben G. Rumbaut, professor of sociology at San Diego State University. "And 
they arrived at the worst possible time -- during the highest inflation in 
memory, followed by the worst recession in 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the boat people have stayed poorer for longer than the first 
refugees. In San Diego during the recession of 1983, for example, Rumbaut found 
that 75% of all Southeast Asian refugees were living below the poverty line, 
but just 25% of the Vietnamese who arrived in 1975 were. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 1.2 million Southeast Asians live in the United States, including 
250,000 children born here. Most statistics tend to lump them as a group, 
masking important differences. A closer look, however, shows that post-1978 
arrivals -- and in some cases their children -- are not climbing the economic 
ladder nearly as fast as their predecessors. After a decade in this country, 
some are still stuck near the bottom rung. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a 1988 federal survey found that just 35% of all Southeast Asian 
refugee households were fully self-supporting. The rest were at least partially 
dependent on welfare, according to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement's 
1989 report to Congress. And the situation is not improving. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the new arrivals don't speak English very well, that's for 
sure, and they don't have marketable skills," said Tuong Duy Nguyen, who argues 
that English-language and job-training programs are inadequate and geared to 
produce only short-term results. "Nearly 100% get entry-level jobs, but they 
have no hope for promotion because they have no skills. . . . In the long run, 
these people will definitely go back to the welfare system." 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to welfare dependency is a rising divorce rate. Though statistics 
are scanty, one Vietnamese social worker estimates that divorces have tripled, 
the product of long separations, shifts in traditional sexual roles and more 
lenient divorce laws. California welfare officials have also noticed an 
increase in the number of single-parent refugee households. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the later arrivals are slowly improving their lot. For example, 
household income of those who arrived between 1976 and 1979 swelled 46% between 
1982 and 1986, to $12,907, IRS returns show. But they still lagged behind the 
1975 households, whose 1986 income was $17,861. 
</P>
<P>
"The point to be made . . . is these groups are improving their status at 
different rates," said Rumbaut, himself a Cuban refugee and co-author of a new 
book titled "Immigrant America: A Portrait." 
</P>
<P>
"The gap widens," Rumbaut added. "And you can see social class differences not 
only between ethnic groups, but among them." 
</P>
<P>
The gap has sparked subtle tensions within the Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
Over lunch in a chic French-style restaurant in Little Saigon, a proud and 
educated man from an upper-class background complained that the latest refugees 
are lazy and abuse U.S. generosity. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left in '75, I didn't know what my future was," said the man, who now 
owns a flourishing business and drives a Mercedes-Benz. "I just wanted freedom. 
And I accepted to die at sea. But now the Vietnamese who come here, they know 
they'll have welfare, they know they'll have an easy life. . . . They are not 
prepared to work." 
</P>
<P>
The man offered an explanation that is often given by members of the fiercely 
anti-Communist exile community. The latecomers, he said, have been corrupted by 
life under the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Others say the new arrivals have simply been worn down by more than 30 years of 
war, followed by 15 years of poverty and repression. 
</P>
<P>
Quynh N. Nguyen of Lakewood, a former South Vietnamese navy captain who fled in 
1975, blamed the Communists for what he sees as the latecomers' tendency toward 
demoralization and dependency. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to my friends and relatives who came later," Nguyen said. "They are 
exhausted, mentally and physically, and do not have the will to live." 
</P>
<P>
Recent arrivals are aware of such attitudes and resent them. 
</P>
<P>
"The latecomers, they say, 'Those who came in '75, they stick their nose in the 
air,' " said Christine Nguyet Pham, who arrived in 1989 and is a caseworker for 
Orange County Refugee Community Resources Opportunity Project Inc. The 1975 
arrivals, however, note that they worked hard to create the cultural comforts 
that the later arrivals enjoy: Vietnamese restaurants and markets offering the 
tastes of home, cafes to relax in, books and newspapers, even 
Vietnamese-speaking job counselors. And, they note, there were no well-placed 
relatives to help them get on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
But if the 1975 arrivals seem elitist, some of the latecomers, who tend to have 
less experience of the West, often have wildly unrealistic attitudes about life 
in America, according to several recent arrivals from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Many denizens of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, read letters from rich 
relatives and dream of joining them in a life of ease, said Tien Tat Chu, a 
former re-education camp inmate who arrived in Huntington Beach in January. 
</P>
<P>
"In Saigon, they say that even the lamppost wants to go to America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After years of war and deprivation, Pham said, some recent arrivals want only a 
chance to enjoy life. She remembered friends promising that when they got to 
America, they would take ballroom dancing lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam, they have the wrong vision of the lifestyle here," Pham said in 
Vietnamese. "They only see what is sent back -- money, gifts, technology, 
abundance. Those in Vietnam only see the enjoyment and not the work." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, she said, Vietnamese accustomed to a slower, more social way of life 
are unprepared for the hustle and bustle of U.S. capitalism, which she called a 
"work, work, work machine." 
</P>
<P>
"When they get over here, their relatives work all day and don't have time to 
explain to them what it takes to survive here," Pham added. "And the life here 
is different -- as if you've been plopped down from the sky." 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of scholars argue that the myth of the miraculous Southeast 
Asian refugee has made life more difficult for the struggling majority. Steven 
J. Gold, assistant professor of sociology at Whittier College, the scholar who 
compared the plight of the newly arrived refugees to that of the U.S. 
underclass, said that stereotypes about Asian immigrants as "model minorities" 
imply that those who are not instant successes have only themselves to blame -- 
even though Vietnamese refugees tend to be highly motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"It tends to downplay the real problems facing the majority of members of the 
group," Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
Kristy Tran, a 19-year-old Golden West College student who arrived in 1979, is 
one of those struggling. When she was 5, her father was arrested by Communist 
soldiers. He never returned. At 10, her mother sent her off by boat with two 
cousins. Now she studies, works and lives in a rented room so she can save 
money to send back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think I'm weak, that I cannot handle the pressure, that I just 
want to forget the people in Vietnam and my mom," she said. "But I have to 
support them. Fifty dollars here can support my mom and my brother for a month. 
I send them about $600 a year." 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans, Tran said, think Vietnamese are rich, and some are jealous. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I go to the gas station, and American guy comes up to me and ask me 
for a dollar because he thinks I have money," she said. "Americans only base 
(their attitudes) on the action of one part of the community and judge all of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
To some Americans, Vietnamese refugees are living symbols of a humiliating 
military defeat. Some Orange County combat veterans interviewed recently, for 
instance, said they resent the presence and affluence of the refugees and are 
not ashamed to say so. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese-Americans are well aware of such sentiments and often feel wounded. 
In a 1989 Times Orange County Poll of 400 adults, 62% said there is "a lot" or 
"some" prejudice against Vietnamese people. 
</P>
<P>
A significant minority of Vietnamese said they have never suffered any form of 
discrimination in America. But those who do encounter it never forget. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine student Phong Cao Ta got the cold shoulder on arrival in his first 
U.S. home -- in Alaska. His father, once an education official in South 
Vietnam, escaped from a re-education camp in 1980 and fled with his son by 
boat. A U.S. official offered to let them out of refugee camp sooner if they 
agreed to settle in an area that had few refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, we go (to) Alaska!" Ta remembered his excited father saying. When they 
arrived, though, the weather was an assault -- and people stared at them. 
</P>
<P>
"You are walking down the street and people are yelling names at you," he said. 
"You turn around and they laugh." 
</P>
<P>
The Tas lasted two weeks in Alaska before fleeing south. 
</P>
<P>
Rich or poor, refugees are unanimous in noting that America's welcome has grown 
cooler of late. Some say their host country has yanked the red carpet out from 
under the feet of the very refugees who have suffered the most. 
</P>
<P>
Liem Huu Nguyen, for example, a peasant boy turned successful lawyer, is the 
stuff refugee myths are made of. But he said he might not have done as well had 
he arrived in America in 1985 instead of 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, born in a tiny village in Central Vietnam, was once a skinny boy who 
went to school hungry. "My friends discovered that I never ate lunch," he said. 
"In fact, I never ate breakfast." When he was 12, friends brought him home to 
dinner, and he asked them why the soup was so delicious. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it had meat in it," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
His youth and peasant background made him atypical of the 1975 arrivals. His 
English was poor, and he was unschooled in Western ways; his first contact with 
U.S. culture had come as a teen-ager, when some passing GIs threw him 
cigarettes, chewing gum and a Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, an hour after Saigon surrendered, he climbed aboard one of the 
last South Vietnamese army helicopters leaving the Can Tho army base. At age 
18, he found himself in a strange land, Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, Americans he met in 1975 bent over backward to help him. He was 
admitted to Oklahoma State, although his English was still inadequate. Once 
there, his grades were not good enough to join an international fraternity to 
which he longed to belong. He went begging to the dean and was invited to join. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of opportunities didn't happen later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen earned a master's degree, then a degree at the University of 
California's Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco and has a private 
practice in San Jose and Oakland. Many of his clients are young Vietnamese who 
have run afoul of the law. 
</P>
<P>
These young arrivals, he says, have been given fewer opportunities and received 
less hospitality from communities that already feel burdened by large Southeast 
Asian populations. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, he said, "America is sick of refugees." 
</P>
<P>
Beset with budget problems, the federal government has cut back on money for 
refugees. Where once it paid for 36 months of refugee aid, it now pays for 
four. Those cutbacks will cost California $135 million in lost federal money 
this year, said Barnes of the California Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming much more difficult to deliver full services to refugees," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese-Americans said they are deeply grateful for the help. But they 
think they dare not ask for more. 
</P>
<P>
"The community now is strong enough to help their fellows," said Xuan Nhi Van 
Ho, executive director of the Orange County Refugee Community Resources 
Opportunity Project. "Many Vietnamese community leaders don't want the 
government to feel that refugees are a burden on them. . . . If we keep asking 
for more help, they will cut the refugee quota." 
</P>
<P>
And Vietnamese worry that they have developed a bad image. Many are mortified 
by the presence of Southeast Asian youth gangs, which have grown more violent 
and almost always prey on their own countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs and crime were cited as the single most serious community problem in the 
Times survey, named twice as often as problems with jobs or assimilation. Yet 
in recent interviews, Vietnamese-Americans expressed both shame and anger over 
what they see as overheated media coverage of the gangs, of welfare fraud, 
microchip theft and other crimes committed by Asians. And though the recent 
flood of books and films by Americans about the Vietnam War may be cathartic 
for Americans, Vietnamese find them distorted and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We despise these movies tremendously," said Duc Au, host of a Vietnamese radio 
program at UC Irvine. Au said the films show Vietnamese people as prostitutes, 
faceless enemies or victims of American -- never Communist -- atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese are never shown as soldiers fighting for their own country alongside 
the Americans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, 58,258 U.S. soldiers have been listed as killed. The Vietnamese 
lost roughly 1.3 million on both sides. The country remains pockmarked with 
bomb craters and one of the poorest nations in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't know anything about the Vietnam War at all, I would think the 
Americans did all the dirty work and the Vietnamese were back in the cities 
having fun," Au said. 
</P>
<P>
Such images are especially undermining to young Vietnamese, said Thieu Quang 
Nguyen, 27, a graduate student in computer science at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the things associated with the word Vietnam are negative: the Vietnam 
War, the cheating in Little Saigon, the gangs," Nguyen said. "And kids grow up 
hurt inside. They feel ashamed. We need to do something to change that 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The computer engineer who complained of U.S. racism agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of young Vietnamese . . . think of their very existence here as part of 
their defeat," he said. "And they don't have any cultural values to be proud 
of." 
</P>
<P>
It is another paradox of the Vietnamese experience that the number of 
Vietnamese dropouts and juvenile delinquents is increasing at the same time 
that many other young Vietnamese are astounding their teachers with their 
academic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Such contradictory realities belie facile stereotypes about Asian students as 
disciplined super-achievers. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego in 1986, Rumbaut and his colleagues found that while just 7% of 
the city's students were Vietnamese, 23% of the year's valedictorians and 
salutatorians were Vietnamese. And Vietnamese-American students had, on 
average, higher grades than whites. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Vietnamese were dropping out at slightly higher rates than white students, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
That pattern is mirrored at Orange County's Westminster High School, where 52% 
of the straight-A students are Indochinese. But by 1987, the Vietnamese dropout 
rate had soared to nearly double the school average, prompting the district to 
start a special anti-dropout program for them. 
</P>
<P>
Rumbaut found that it was the children who came to the United States without 
one or both parents who were far more likely to drop out of school or get in 
trouble with the police. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Liem Huu Nguyen, who has represented many youth offenders, said most 
of his clients are recent arrivals who come from broken families and speak 
little English. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them survived traumatic experiences," he said. "Their parents died in 
the war, or else they sank on the boats, or a family member died on the boat. 
They are very young, but they are very bitter about society. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids of the '75 wave are (doing) OK, even if they are really 
Americanized," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rumbaut found that the best academic performers tended to be Vietnamese 
youngsters who arrived in the United States before puberty, giving them time to 
learn idiomatic English and adjust to U.S. schools before their high school 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Students performed better when their parents tried to preserve their ethnic 
heritage while adjusting to U.S. life. Furthermore, the more depressed the 
mother, the lower the grade-point average of the child. 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, the pace was slower, the family was larger and everybody helped 
bring up the children. But in America, refugee parents are working two jobs and 
coping with myriad problems of their own. Tony Doan, a family counselor, said 
that when children fail, it is often from neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnamese people go to work early in the morning and come home late and cook 
dinner and go to bed and do it again in the morning," Doan said. "Sometimes 
weekends. So they don't have time to take care of their children. And the kids 
feel lonely." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Vietnamese-American experience cannot be explained by the mere 
facts of background, income or education. What drives many refugees is the 
immeasurable desire to reconstruct, from the shards of their former identities, 
lives to be proud of, families that are whole and enduring. Yet they remain in 
the grip of a deep sorrow, even a bitterness, that is the legacy of a century 
of war against the French, the Americans and each other. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1984 mental health survey of Vietnamese, almost half reported feelings of 
depression, anxiety, hopelessness or worthlessness, compared with just 
one-quarter of Americans. Acute depression was also double the U.S. average. 
</P>
<P>
Time does appear to be healing many of those wounds, the study found. Yet scars 
linger. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ton-That Niem -- once a secretary of health in South Vietnam, now a 
psychiatrist specializing in refugee mental health -- said he has treated many 
refugees with post-traumatic stress disorder. Many were rape victims or had 
seen relatives killed. Others, particularly middle-age women, complain of 
insomnia, anxiety, head, stomach and backaches -- and a terrible feeling of 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'I came here, I cannot go out. I cannot drive. All my children or 
grandchildren are gone at work or in class. I am alone in the house. I don't 
know what to do. Sometimes by myself behind these closed doors, I feel scared.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then they break into tears and say, 'Had I known life (would be like this), I 
would not have come here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Niem said Westerners tend to underestimate the pain that Vietnamese, especially 
elders, feel because of separation from their ancestral homeland and its 
4,000-year-old culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We were forced to leave the land that appeared unlivable to us. . . . But our 
people are very attached to the land," Niem said. 
</P>
<P>
He sees the founding of many Roman Catholic churches and Buddhist temples by 
Vietnamese as an important step toward healing. "That is a consolation," he 
said. "It relieves their guilt, partially, in leaving their land and ancestors 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
There are many other hopeful signs in Little Saigon. On weekends, the shopping 
district is jammed with families pushing strollers and children who chatter 
away in English and Vietnamese. Despite their relative poverty, 
Vietnamese-Americans have the lowest infant mortality rate of any ethnic group 
in the nation. Researchers cite abstinence from smoking, alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Business is booming. There are cultural festivals, classes in Vietnamese for 
children, more than two dozen newspapers, a $1.2-million senior citizens center 
being built, a TV station and a vibrant nightclub scene. Most of all, Little 
Saigon is a place to be Vietnamese in America, yet at ease. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years of exile, many are also reaching back to Vietnam for solace. A 
growing number of Vietnamese say in private they support normalization of 
relations between Washington and Hanoi. Risking the wrath of devoutly 
anti-Communist fellow exiles, thousands have quietly returned to visit. 
</P>
<P>
During the Tet Festival this February, so many Californians headed for Vietnam 
that it was impossible to get a seat on a plane, according to a person who made 
the trek. 
</P>
<P>
Mai Cong, chairman of Vietnamese Community of Orange County and a tireless 
community activist, said she has not been back, but she has made peace with her 
memories of home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the memory of your childhood, the places where you were raised, where 
your parents are, where your ancestors are buried," Cong said. "It's priceless. 
It is inside you."

The Vietnam Exodus 
</P>
<P>
1. In April, 1975, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese flee south as coastal 
cities surrender. 
</P>
<P>
2. U.S. Marines begin evacuating remaining Americans from Saigon. However, 
enemy shelling closes Tan Son Nhut Air Base, forcing evacuation by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
3. Gen. Duong Van Minh surrenders unconditionally on April 30 at 10:24 a.m. By 
then, more than 100,000 South Vietnamese had already fled. 
</P>
<P>
4. In 1978, Vietnam invades Cambodia, and China invades Vietnam. Vietnam then 
expels its ethnic Chinese. The exodus of "boat people" begins.

Most of the refugees who arrived in 1975 hailed from Vietnam's military, 
professional and social elite. They account for fewer than one-third of all 
refugees. Later arrivals tended to be rural, with less education and fewer 
skills, and have had far more trouble achieving economic self-sufficiency.

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 10 years ago, a new eight-lane stretch of the Riverside Freeway opened, 
bringing relief to Orange County residents making their way through Santa Ana 
Canyon into the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Where drivers once had to maneuver along a narrow, winding highway, the freeway 
opening meant motorists could go from Anaheim Hills to Corona and on to Palm 
Springs and Las Vegas in record time. 
</P>
<P>
But what was once hailed as a solution to gridlock has turned into one of the 
region's worst nightmares. With the growth of Riverside County beyond anyone's 
expectations, the corridor, within the past five years, has once again become a 
bottleneck. And this time, transportation officials in both counties doubt the 
problem has an easy solution. 
</P>
<P>
Every weekday starting at 4 a.m., commuters heading to jobs in Orange County 
often travel bumper to bumper along the freeway, with traffic jams at times 
extending from Corona to the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
These same commuters -- many of whom moved to Riverside County seeking 
affordable housing -- face the same gridlock coming home when eastbound traffic 
backs up for miles. In all, more than 200,000 vehicles pass through the 
corridor every day, and the volume is only getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the worst freeway in Southern California, but it's getting there," 
said Min-Der Day, a civil traffic engineer for the city of Corona. 
</P>
<P>
While potential solutions, ranging from connector roads and parallel routes to 
commuter rails and double-decked freeways, are being proposed, all remain in 
the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Riverside and Orange county officials are pinning their hopes on the 
construction of car-pool lanes, one in each direction, that would stretch from 
Magnolia Avenue in Riverside to the Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County will fund most of its portion of the project with money 
generated from a countywide half-cent sales tax passed last year. Construction 
is expected to begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County still has no funding, and transportation experts warn that if 
lanes are built only in Riverside County, the situation won't be much better 
because traffic will simply become snarled at the county line. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, suggested that Riverside County lend Orange County money so the new 
lanes could be built at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Reagan, the executive director of the Riverside County Transportation 
Commission, said he doubts the board would approve such a request. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we could spend our highway money for a project in another 
county," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
And even with the car-pool lanes, officials worry that it is too little, too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start, but it's not going to meet the demand for the next 20 years," 
Day said. "It doesn't matter how big the roadway is, it's not enough. One 
accident is going to stop all the traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bradley, the executive vice president of the Corona Chamber of Commerce, 
predicted that within two or three years after the lanes open, traffic will 
once again come to a halt because of the heavy growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Corona officials say the solution rests in diverting traffic away from Corona. 
They are anxious to do something about the heavy traffic on local streets 
caused by thousands of commuters who cut through Corona to avoid the Riverside 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"People make a parking lot out of our city," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona officials are among the most vocal advocates of an alternative, parallel 
route to the Riverside Freeway that would go through the Cleveland National 
Forest. The route, called the Cajalco corridor, would link on the east with the 
existing two-lane Cajalco Road between the Corona Freeway and the Escondido 
Expressway, and on the west with the proposed Foothill or Eastern toll road in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County Transportation Commission has commissioned a $285,000 
study of the corridor, Reagan said. The cost of the project, if it ever is 
built, could exceed $500 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County officials say that any such road is bound to run into 
environmental opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It illustrates the desperation Riverside folks are feeling to find an 
alternate route," Oftelie said. He added that OCTC has been unable to widen the 
Ortega Highway, an existing route through the same forest, because of 
environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Orange County officials are studying the idea of a commuter train 
that would link the two counties along existing track that runs parallel to the 
freeway, said Kia Mortazavi, the manager of highway programs with OCTC. The 
project could be partially funded with revenue generated from the state gas-tax 
initiative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But what could ultimately alter the traffic flow is a gradual shift in jobs to 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
"(Employees) can't work well when they're blown away in their fatigue," Reagan 
said. "It's going to happen. We just want it to happen quicker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Riverside Freeway Solutions 
</P>
<P>
1. Addition of a car-pool lane in each direction from the Orange Freeway to 
Magnolia Avenue in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
2. Commuter train on existing Santa Fe rail track. 
</P>
<P>
3. /4. Corona expressway connector road through Tonner and Soquel canyons. 
</P>
<P>
5. Cajaico Expressway through Cleveland National Forest.

6. Proposed Foothill toll road.

MENTALLY DISABLED OREGON MAN MISSING AFTER TOUR BUS TRIP 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three days ago, Russell Lomax, a 35-year-old mentally disabled native of 
Portland, Ore., set out to fulfill his lifelong dream of visiting the homes of 
the movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something he always wanted to do," said John Himes, Lomax's guardian and 
brother-in-law, who brought Lomax with him to California on Monday while he 
attended a business conference at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Himes put Lomax on a Gray Line tour bus from the parking 
lot of an Anaheim motel. He tipped the driver $5 to make sure that Lomax, who 
has the mental capacity of an 8-year-old, would be well cared for. 
</P>
<P>
Lomax never returned. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Himes and local family members launched a publicity campaign about 
Lomax's mysterious disappearance to get him back, hopefully unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is frightening," Himes said before he and two relatives began circulating 
hundreds of flyers around Hollywood, where they assume Lomax got lost. "He 
could be anywhere. And he doesn't know anything about this area." 
</P>
<P>
Lomax was last seen Thursday about 10 a.m. leaving the Gray Line bus when it 
made a short stop at the Mann Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, said 
Anaheim Police Officer Edward Thaete, who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
Lomax was to go from the theater to a tour of the Beverly Hills homes of the 
movie stars and then return to the Jolly Roger Inn near Disneyland by 5 p.m., 
Himes said. 
</P>
<P>
When Lomax did not show up in Anaheim, Himes called the bus company, which 
suggested that he call the hotels where the tour bus stopped. But Lomax was 
nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 p.m., an anxious Himes decided to call Anaheim police and report the 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
But Thaete said the department, which has enlisted the help of the Beverly 
Hills police, has no leads in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very baffling," Thaete said. "I have a lot of questions in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Lomax was described as being 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighing 160 pounds, 
with straight brown hair and a mustache. He was last seen wearing a green sweat 
shirt with a Mickey Mouse T-shirt over it, a pair of stone-washed jeans and 
low-top Reebok running shoes, Thaete said. 
</P>
<P>
Thaete said Lomax carried a wallet with $25 in it. The wallet also contained 
his identification. But if the wallet has been stolen, Himes said, Lomax would 
have a difficult time telling people who he is. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very shy with people," Himes said, adding that Lomax would not be able 
to communicate with people at all if he felt confused or disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
Himes said that Lomax not only has a severe speech impediment but has no 
conception of distance, numbers or even how to buy food. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday night, with Himes remaining at the motel awaiting word from 
authorities, family members were scouring the Hollywood area, passing out 
flyers and looking in stores for Lomax. 
</P>
<P>
"He's especially interested in video stores, record stores and bookstores," 
although he has no reading comprehension, said Deborah Himes, Lomax's 
sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the lack of clues, John Himes decided to recruit the help of the 
Adam Walsh Child Resource Center on Friday night. The Westminster-based office, 
which specializes in finding lost children, helped design a flyer and has 
reported the disappearance to the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Day, a spokeswoman for the resource center, said anyone who might have 
information about Lomax should call the center at (714) 898-4802 or the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at (800) 843-5678. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deborah Himes and her father, Ray Olson, who lives in Huntington 
Beach, will continue to canvass the Hollywood area every night. John Himes said 
he will not go back to Portland but will remain with Olson until he learns what 
happened to his brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
What is puzzling about the disappearance, John Himes said, is that Lomax is not 
the type to wander off by himself. Lomax's family speculates that after missing 
the bus, he decided to walk back to Anaheim. That thought is unnerving to them. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't even know how to get off an escalator without getting frightened," 
Deborah Himes said.

FBI agents Saturday arrested a man charged in Dallas with fleeing from a 
cocaine indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Agents said they arrested Kevin Pressley Johnson, 23, of Baltimore without 
incident after he was seen driving near La Palma and Knott avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was indicted last July in Dallas for possessing cocaine for delivery, 
agents said. A federal warrant was issued after it appeared that he had fled 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Agents also arrested Sarah Dyer, 30, of Buena Park, Johnson's companion. 
</P>
<P>
She is wanted on a Los Angeles County warrant for failure to appear in court on 
a drug charge and was turned over to Buena Park police, agents said.

A Marine Corps recruiter was in jail Saturday after a man he knocked down in a 
supermarket parking lot went into a coma after striking his head on the 
pavement, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Larry Lamar Hatch, 22, of Garden Grove, was knocked unconscious by 
blows to his head and suffered severe head injuries when he fell to the 
pavement, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch was in critical condition at Los Alamitos Medical Center, according to 
police. Family members said Hatch underwent emergency brain surgery but is not 
expected to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the Marine as Sgt. Juan Antonio Rodriguez, 29, of Irvine, 
reportedly a former boxer, who was being held on suspicion of attempted murder. 
Bail was set at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Friday at 9:50 a.m. in the parking lot of Albertson's 
supermarket at Brookhurst Street and Orange Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hatch and several others, all Albertson's workers who had just 
finished their shift, were drinking beer in a parked truck. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez walked by the truck toward his recruiting office near Albertson's, 
police said, and "a verbal altercation" broke out between him and the group in 
the pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
According to officers, Rodriguez left, then returned with three other Marines 
from the recruiting office. Rodriguez, described as being 6 feet, 1 inch tall 
and weighing 212 pounds, singled out Hatch and began punching him in the head, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch, described as about 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighing 145 pounds, fell 
unconscious almost immediately, police said.

It should have been a day of celebration for Tung Phan. Saturday marked his 
10th year in the United States after fleeing the communists of his native 
Vietnam. Saturday was also his 17th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
And on Saturday, Tung participated in a nerve-racking competition against 20 
other California high school students, answering tough questions about politics 
and geography while seeking to win scholarship money and the chance to compete 
in the nationwide Citizen Bee. 
</P>
<P>
But Tung, who had endured 10 rounds of mind-probing questions, faltered on his 
11th: Name the organization, founded in 1912, that is the largest national 
organization for businesses, representing about 4.5 million members. 
</P>
<P>
Tung, concentrating with his head bowed as if in prayer while the judges 
awaited his answer, guessed, "The Kiwanis." The correct answer is the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce. As he stepped down from the stage, crestfallen, Tung 
became the last of five students from Orange County to be eliminated from the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
"Another chance next year," the junior from Kennedy High shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
He finished in 10th place. First place in the state Citizen Bee was earned by 
Everett Chun, a San Gabriel High student, who said he was "an average student 
who believes in commitment" to studying. Everett won a $3,000 scholarship. The 
top three winners will face students from all over the country in June in the 
national Citizen Bee for even more scholarship money. 
</P>
<P>
With education leaders complaining that high school students know more about 
singer George Michael than they do about George Washington, the Citizen Bee 
gave these students a chance to flaunt an in-depth knowledge that would silence 
most education critics. 
</P>
<P>
For each contestant, it meant hundreds of grueling hours of studying history, 
economics, geography, government and current events. With the encouragement of 
parents and the guidance of teachers, these 20 students emerged from 900 
competitors throughout California in regional competitions in late March and 
early April. 
</P>
<P>
And after mastering everything from the French Revolution to the geographical 
location of the Hawaiian Island, the 20 students put their intelligence to the 
test. Seated on a stage in the Harry Chandler Auditorium in the downtown Los 
Angeles Times building, they approached a microphone, lights shining in their 
faces, and responded to questions. One by one, they were picked off by a single 
tricky question or unfamiliar topic. 
</P>
<P>
"It blasted my ego," said Mayumi Negishi , a senior at El Toro High. "At your 
school, you think you're the best student. But the contest kind of put things 
in perspective, seeing so many people who know so much. It's a little bit 
humbling." 
</P>
<P>
Mayumi floundered in the sixth round. The troubling question: What did Adam 
Smith mean by the "invisible hand" that operates in market economies? The right 
answer: Individuals who act out of self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
Huell Howser, producer of KCET's "Videolog," asked students the questions from 
the podium. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a history major in college," Howser said. "And I knew about 70% of the 
answers. The rest -- I didn't have a clue. It's amazing the depth of knowledge 
that these students have." 
</P>
<P>
The students were given special books to help them master the mounds of 
historical and cultural tidbits asked in the contest. But many of the whiz 
kids, refuting critics who complain about the quality of high school education, 
said they learned almost all they know from their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The background information from all my classes helped more than the book," 
Mayumi said. 
</P>
<P>
For Tung, studying began in earnest when he was in the fourth grade. Of course, 
he said, he didn't know then that he would one day test his knowledge against 
some of the smartest students from throughout the state. He studied out of 
personal interest. As a refugee who fled as a 7-year-old by boat from Vietnam, 
Tung read five books in different languages about the Vietnam war. That, in 
turn, sparked an interest in the history of his new country. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I realized the contributions of our early fathers -- George Washington 
and Abraham Lincoln," he said. "And I read more." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ulrich and Mark Goldrup, both seniors from Mission Viejo High, stayed up 
past midnight Friday with their teacher in a Los Angeles hotel, cramming for 
Saturday's battery of questions. Unfortunately, they were asked about material 
they hadn't studied in the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis was asked to name the author of "The Good Earth." The answer is Pearl 
Buck. Mark was asked about the subject matter of Rachel Carson's book "Silent 
Spring." He guess the answer was global warming, but the correct response was 
the dangers of pesticides.

<P>
In a game filled with extraordinary scorers and crowd-pleasing shooters, the 
play of three unheralded players paced the South to a 121-114 victory Saturday 
in the 25th Orange County All-Star boys' basketball game at Cal State 
Fullerton's Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 2,004 saw guards Mark Flint and John Trevino and center Greg Everett 
lead a fourth-quarter rally that helped erase a 10-point deficit and gave the 
South its 14th victory in 25 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, a perimeter shooter from Laguna Beach, gave the South the lead for 
good with 9:07 remaining when he made a three-point shot for a 97-94 lead. 
Moments later, he added a driving layup to push the lead to five points, 99-94. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, from El Toro, added 14 points and seven rebounds, scoring 11 points in 
the second half. Everett will attend Creighton in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Flint, a not-so-flashy point guard from Corona del Mar, ran the South's offense 
efficiently and committed only two turnovers. The trio left the game to loud 
applause with the South leading, 101-94, early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"That group bought them some time and then finally got them the lead," said 
North Coach Tim O'Brien of Estancia. "We knew Scott McCorkle and Keith Walker 
were going to get their points, but those other guys really hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
As expected, McCorkle and Walker were the big guns for the South. McCorkle, a 
forward from Capistrano Valley, led all scorers with 27 points, making nine of 
18 field-goal attempts and nine of 11 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a usually accurate shooter from Brea-Olinda, added 23 points but made 
only eight of 19 shots and missed all five of his three-point attempts. Walker 
led the South with 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought those two worked together fine," said South Coach Rainer Wulf of 
Trabuco Hills. "I'd love to have both of them. We were shooting for the game 
record of 124 points, but when you shoot 41%, you're not going to set any 
records." 
</P>
<P>
North center Robert Conlisk of Los Alamitos was named the game's most valuable 
player. Conlisk had 10 rebounds and 24 points, scoring 15 points in the second 
quarter when the North took a 61-51 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Three days ago, O'Brien wondered if Conlisk would play after talking to his 
mother and learning that the senior was having academic problems in one of his 
classes. Conlisk arrived late for a scrimmage against Orange Coast College 
Thursday night, but it was obvious he was the best player on the team and he 
continued to play well Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of out of sync in the first quarter and got a little out of 
control," Conlisk said. "But I was happy with my game. I haven't been playing 
much, just working on the weights to get stronger for college ball." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf was impressed with Conlisk, saying, "He was a lot more active inside than 
I thought he was. He hurt us in the first half, but when we walked to the 
locker room at the half, I noticed most of their heads were down. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my team in the locker room that we may be down by 10 points, but 
they're tired. We've got them right where we want them." 
</P>
<P>
The South used a halfcourt trap to get back into the game with Flint and Beau 
Hossler getting some key steals and McCorkle sealing the victory with nine 
points in the last quarter, including five of six free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of (Agustin) Heredia, I thought our guards were better than 
their guards," Wulf said. "Our reserves were solid and McCorkle played a great 
game. He did everything we asked him to do for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who is one of four finalists for the coaching position at Christ 
College Irvine, thought his team's failure to get the ball into the low post in 
the second half was the turning point in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody really had a good second half for us," he said. "I would've liked to 
have played Conlisk the whole game, but your hands are kind of tied in an 
all-star game. You have to play everybody and make sure they all get their 
time."

BIG WEST BASEBALL ROUNDUP;

TITAN FORTUNES TURN INTO 9-6 DEFEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
It was only a week ago that Cal State Fullerton was cruising along with a 
seven-game winning streak. Saturday, however, the Titans lost their third 
consecutive game, a 9-6 defeat to Cal State Long Beach in Big West Conference 
action that proved Fullerton's fortunes had indeed turned. 
</P>
<P>
"A triple play didn't start the day well," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their 15 hits and six runs, the triple play exemplified the Titans' 
day. Fullerton consistently had runners on base and consistently failed to 
advance them. 
</P>
<P>
The triple play came in the top of the second with Fullerton trailing, 3-0. 
Frank Charles led off the inning with a double and Steve Sisco followed with an 
infield single to bring up Matt Hattabaugh. Hattabaugh lined to first baseman 
Don Barbara, who stepped on the bag to force Sisco and threw to second base to 
force Charles. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to matter much thereafter, though, as Fullerton scored three 
runs in the third inning to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
But from that point on, it was a day for Long Beach as the Titans wasted even 
more opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the bases loaded three times and we didn't even hit the ball," Cochell 
said. "We had plenty of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, meanwhile, was creating opportunities. The 49ers got three hits 
with the count at two strikes and no balls. 
</P>
<P>
"We practice that in the batting cages so I guess its paying off," Long Beach 
Coach Dave Snow said. "We're the top-hitting team in the conference, so we're 
very confident up there (despite the count)." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (29-18-1, 6-6 in conference) scored four runs in the bottom of the 
third inning, two more in the fourth and was never seriously threatened after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had 11 hits, seven of which were doubles, and had runners in scoring 
position every inning. 
</P>
<P>
James Popoff (7-4) gave up seven runs in three innings for the loss. Fullerton 
used three relievers who faired only slightly better. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Gonzales singled in each of his four at bats for one bright spot for 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
In another Big West Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara 6, UC Irvine 4 -- Mike Czarnetzki hit a three-run homer in the 
ninth inning for host UC Santa Barbara (34-14, 9-5). Steve May (4-3) pitched an 
inning in relief to take the loss for Irvine (28-22, 5-9). 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gallego had three hits and three RBIs and Ozmar DeChavez had three hits 
and scored a run for Irvine. The teams conclude the series today at 1 p.m. at 
UC Santa Barbara.

RANCHO SANTIAGO WINS ON HIT IN 10TH

Freshman Shaun Sterling's run-scoring single in the 10th inning gave Rancho 
Santiago College a 5-4 victory over Orange Coast Saturday, and the Dons 
clinched at least a tie for the Orange Empire Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (31-8, 17-5 in conference) leads second-place Golden West by 
two games with two remaining. Golden West defeated Cypress, 11-2, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling's hit, his second RBI single of the game, ended a frustrating game for 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago had 15 hits and Orange Coast committed four errors, but the 
Dons had enough base-running mistakes to keep it close. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago missed a scoring opportunity in the eighth, when Rob Reimers 
walked to open the inning and Greg Martineau was hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Reimers was caught off second base and tagged in a rundown for the first out. 
Sterling grounded into a force play for the second out, but the inning was kept 
alive when Jeremy Sherman reached base on a fielding error. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling took third on a passed ball, but Sherman was picked off first to end 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived and we've died by our baserunning all season," Rancho Santiago 
Coach Don Sneddon said. "Today we died a couple deaths out there." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling's single in the second gave Rancho Santiago a 1-0 lead. Sid 
Maldonado's two-run double in the fourth put OCC ahead, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Grack had an RBI double and Chris Floth an RBI single in the fifth to 
give Rancho Santiago a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
OCC went ahead, 4-3, on four consecutive singles in the sixth. Mike Burns and 
Kevin Schula had the final two for RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago tied it in the seventh on an RBI double by Marty Neff. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides went down in order in the ninth, but OCC had a chance to go ahead in 
the 10th. Mark Dodd had a two-out double and Maldonado was intentionally 
walked. Both moved up a base when Rancho Santiago starter Rob Nay balked. 
</P>
<P>
But Nay got Burns to ground out on an outstanding play by third baseman Greg 
Martineau for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
Floth started Rancho Santiago's half of the 10th inning with a double that was 
a foot shy of going over the right-field fence. Pinch-hitter Jeff White was 
walked intentionally, and OCC starter Tom Irwin was replaced by John Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart walked Martineau intentionally to bring up Sterling, who got the 
game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
Nay (5-1) allowed 10 hits in 10 innings but earned the victory with the help of 
three double plays. Irwin (5-4) took the loss for OCC (15-19, 8-13). 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago, with a bye on Tuesday, needs one victory -- Thursday over 
Golden West or Saturday over Fullerton -- to win the conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 11, Cypress 2 -- Todd Long (7-2) pitched a seven-hitter with no 
walks for host Golden West (25-10, 15-7). Freshman third baseman Gerad Cawhorn 
had three hits, including a three-run double in the eighth, and a triple, for 
Golden West. The Rustlers scored five runs in the eighth to take an 11-2 lead. 
Mark Magrann added three hits and two RBIs for Golden West, which plays Orange 
Coast on Tuesday. Cypress is 22-17, 8-13. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 11, Fullerton 6 -- Riverside scored five unearned runs in the ninth 
to break a 6-6 tie at Fullerton. Randy Beasley had a two-out, two-run single 
after an error gave Riverside an 8-6 lead. The victory moves the Tigers (26-14, 
11-11) to within a half-game of third-place Fullerton. The top three teams are 
assured of playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Short had an RBI double to extend his hitting streak to 16 games. Dave 
Weckerle had two hits and two RBIs and Kevin Monson had two hits for Fullerton 
(21-13, 11-10).

Southern California College lost its chance to move into a first-place tie in 
the Golden West Athletic Conference when Azusa Pacific won both games of a 
doubleheader Saturday at SCC. 
</P>
<P>
SCC was shooting for a sweep of its own, which would have meant a tie with 
Azusa Pacific at the top of conference standings going into the last week of 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Azusa Pacific got a complete game from Jose Gallardo to win the first 
game, 5-2, and then rallied to win the second, 6-4. And the Vanguards got to 
watch as the Cougars (30-10, 15-3 in the conference) rejoiced after clinching 
the conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
It was a frustrating celebration for the Vanguards (26-17-1, 11-7) to watch. 
Not only did they lose a share of first place but they dropped into third 
behind Cal Baptist, which swept a doubleheader from Christ College Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Vanguards likely will be one of four teams to qualify for the 
National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 playoffs in April and 
Azusa Pacific will be the host. 
</P>
<P>
"They can celebrate on our field but if we get into the playoffs, we might get 
to celebrate at their field and that hurts just as much," SCC Coach Charlie 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific took advantage of SCC lapses to win each game. In the first game, 
SCC's Jim Dedrick, the district's earned-run-average leader entering the game, 
walked a total of four batters in the fourth and sixth and the Cougars scored 
two runs in each inning. Dedrick walked six in the game. 
</P>
<P>
SCC took a 3-1 lead in the first inning of the second game when catcher Denny 
Berni hit a two-run double and scored on a throwing error. Azusa Pacific 
rallied with three runs in the fifth, two of which were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
In another Golden State Athletic Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
Cal Baptist 9-7, Christ College Irvine 4-6 -- Cal Baptist (31-15, 12-6) scored 
three runs in the seventh inning of the second game and moved into second place 
in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
In a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game: 
</P>
<P>
Chapman 6, Cal State Los Angeles 2 -- Doug Yates had three hits, including two 
doubles, and scored two runs and Mike Giuseffi had a two-run home run in the 
sixth for Chapman (29-21, 6-8). 
</P>
<P>
Pete Coleman (8-5) pitched a seven-hitter with six strikeouts for Chapman. 
Chris Cutliff hit a solo home run and Curt Ledesma had two hits and two RBIs 
for Chapman.

CS FULLERTON SPLITS SOFTBALL DOUBLEHEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton gained a split with Cal Poly Pomona in a Big West 
Conference softball doubleheader Saturday at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (42-17, 20-9 in conference) won the first game, 2-0, on run-scoring 
singles by Missy Coombes and Charlotte Wiley. Pomona (27-30, 10-18) won the 
second game, 1-0, behind the one-hit pitching of Bonnie Ebenkamp. 
</P>
<P>
In California Collegiate Athletic Assn. softball: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield 2-1, Chapman 1-0 -- Trina Honea had Chapman's (36-17, 
7-11) only run batted in at Bakersfield (33-11, 11-7).

BUENA PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down the long and twisting hallway, Yul Brynner glowers defiantly as the King 
of Siam, a pistol-waving Roger Moore lunges as Agent 007, and the cast of "Star 
Trek" goes where no man has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
A trickle of visitors pause at the displays for a few seconds at a time, 
usually just long enough to admire the gleam in Ed Asner's glass eyes or the 
cut of Marilyn Monroe's gown. Then they move on. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, one of the few survivors among 
the dozens of major galleries that once sprouted across the nation. Along with 
the Hollywood Wax Museum, Movieland has thrived by catering to an insatiable 
desire among tourists to mingle with celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only opportunity they're going to get to stare eyeball to eyeball 
with their favorite star," said Movieland owner Ronald M. Fong, who 
characterizes his 250-figure collection as "the granddaddy" of the nation's wax 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
Their heyday having melted away, wax museums are anachronisms compared to theme 
parks crammed with high-tech extravaganzas and looping roller coasters. Yet, 
the campy Movieland has stayed in business by feeding off the thrill-seeking 
crowds headed for nearby Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Movieland still attracts nearly half a million tourists per year -- people 
willing to plop down $9.95 for a walk into the past. With low labor and 
operational costs, the museum continues to be a big moneymaker. 
</P>
<P>
Wax figures "don't eat and they don't ask for raises," said Joseph F. 
Prevratil, a Long Beach-based tourism consultant who was general manager of 
Movieland in the 1970s. He said a well-managed wax museum can return 50 cents 
on every box office dollar. 
</P>
<P>
With the lure of those kinds of profits, the waxworks industry is making a mild 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Movieland owner Fong plans to open a new "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" museum 
of human and natural oddities across Beach Boulevard from Movieland this 
summer. It will include about 30 wax figures. Ripley's is trying to expand into 
other cities as well. 
</P>
<P>
Movieland founder Allen Parkinson is trying to find backers for a $6-million 
"Life of Christ Historical Wax Museum" in Anaheim. A new Palace of Wax recently 
opened outside Dallas. Even the world-acclaimed Madame Tussaud's museum in 
London -- which Fong concedes is "the grandmother of them all" -- is 
considering plans to expand into New York and the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We would want to make it a fairly long-term investment. That means a fairly 
heavy level of commitment," said Michael Herbert, chairman of the Tussaud's 
Group, which operates the highly successful wax museums in London and 
Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
In order to succeed, however, modern wax museums may have to innovate in an 
industry that has remained largely unchanged going back to the times of ancient 
Greeks and Romans, when wax was carved into the figures of gods and the memory 
of ancestors was preserved through wax life masks. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Tussaud opened her famous English gallery in 1835, though wax museums did 
not take hold in the United States until after World War II. The phenomenon was 
popularized by movies such as the 3-D "House of Wax" in 1953, a remake of "The 
Mystery of the Wax Museum" in 1933. In the 1953 version, Vincent Price plays a 
deranged wax sculptor who gets his kicks out of covering people in wax. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the introduction of fiberglass in wax figures and some special 
effects in the sets, wax museums have not changed much through the years, and 
their appeal faded. As late as the mid-1970s, the International Assn. of Wax 
Museums recognized more than 50 galleries across the nation. Today, industry 
insiders cannot name more than a half-dozen museums that remain -- and the 
association no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many bad ones that they closed up," said sculptor Peter 
Carsillo, of the new Palace of Wax in Grand Prairie, Tex. "There were so many 
hastily built, trailer park-type wax museums out there. It was inevitable that 
they would close." 
</P>
<P>
Carsillo, who also has carved figures for Movieland, said realism is achieved 
through elaborate lighting and expensive sets. He said the extra attention pays 
off when he sees how viewers react to his scenes depicting the life of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real nice Crucifixion here," Carsillo said. "We have a lot of clergy 
come through here and just lose it." 
</P>
<P>
David Robert Cellitti, resident sculptor at Movieland, said audiences "were 
getting used to seeing some very sophisticated things," forcing wax museums to 
add special effects to continue to try to lure audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Movieland and others have tried to keep pace by building environments rather 
than sets. These include entire rooms that place the viewer in the predicament 
of the wax characters, complete with sound or lighting effects, realistic props 
and even temperature changes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Movieland patrons witness a gunfight between a battle-dressed 
Chuck Norris and a bunch of bad guys, complete with sound and muzzle flashes. A 
chill from a supposedly ruptured refrigeration line adds realism to the wrecked 
engine room of a capsized ocean liner for "The Poseidon Adventure" movie set. 
</P>
<P>
Attention to detail appears to be an ingredient to Movieland's success, which 
has ranked 10th in attendance among Southern California amusement attractions 
despite its low profile and virtually non-existent advertising budget. 
</P>
<P>
When it opened, Movieland was hailed as bringing American wax sculpture out of 
the musty sideshows of carnivals and setting new standards of realism and set 
design. 
</P>
<P>
The building and its huge glittery sign became a hit with locals and tourists 
as attendance climbed to 900,000 a year. The debuts of new sets were publicized 
with the hoopla of a new ride at any local theme park. Parents took their 
children to see their favorite television stars. Dating teen-agers went in the 
evenings as an alternative to drive-in movies and miniature golf. 
</P>
<P>
Movieland founder Parkinson says he was awe-struck by the success. "On 
weekends, the cars were lined up as far as the eye could see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Six Flags bought the wax museum and bulldozed the Palace of Living Art, an 
adjoining gallery in which famous paintings were re-created in wax. It added a 
chamber of horrors as part of a $1-million renovation. With an array of large 
theme parks to worry about, including Magic Mountain in Valencia, Six Flags 
sold Movieland to Fong five years ago for $5.3 million. The Fong family already 
was successfully operating the Fisherman's Wharf Wax Museum and other 
amusements in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Movieland is marketed almost entirely to tourists, though promotion 
consists of little more than stocking motel lobbies with pamphlets. The idea is 
to catch the attention of tourists who spend three or more days visiting Orange 
County and have already seen Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Besides reaping strong box office revenues, the walking Movieland tour requires 
that all visitors have their photo taken with George Burns on the way in so 
hopefully they will buy the photo on the way out. They are also run through two 
well-stocked gift shops and a photo-on-a-T-shirt emporium. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Wax Museum, which draws tourists who go to ogle the famous 
footprints at Mann's Chinese Theatre next door on Hollywood Boulevard, has 
thrived as well. General Manager Raubi Sundher said attendance remains "quite 
steady," although he declined to release attendance figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Wax museums themselves are not the main draw, but (most of) the time, they are 
near an area that's a draw. People don't see stars walking down the street 
anymore. It's the second best thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood museum budgets more for upkeep than for advertising. But the 
exhibit reaps free exposure by being a backdrop for the shooting of movies or 
TV shows, including five last year alone. "We get a lot of publicity being in 
Hollywood," Sundher said. 
</P>
<P>
While the names may change, the process has remained virtually the same for 
hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides such maintenance costs as shampooing Shirley Temple's curls, 
celebrity-based wax museums must constantly keep adding famous replicas to stay 
current. 
</P>
<P>
Movieland has built a new Pee-wee Herman fun house area and comedian Eddie 
Murphy is hot among wax exhibitors. But keeping up is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people to pick up a TV Guide from a year ago and try to remember the 
shows and try to remember who was in them," sculptor Cellitti said. "It 
suddenly becomes very difficult because the person touted as the hot new 
property may not be the hot new property." 
</P>
<P>
The next obvious innovation would be to animate the figures. After all, Disney 
has its talking Mr. Lincoln and rollicking Pirates of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Madame Tussaud's Herbert said his company already has recognized the potential, 
introducing a "Rock Circus" of animated figures of rock stars at an exhibit in 
London's Piccadilly Circus. 
</P>
<P>
But generally, animation is considered prohibitively expensive because the 
robotics requires an army of technicians for regular maintenance and 
breakdowns. And pretty soon, it would be a robot museum rather than a wax 
museum -- and purists want none of that. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be a nostalgic twinge to going to a wax museum," Cellitti 
said. "It represents something from an earlier, more innocent age."

ENTREPRENEUR HOPES TURBINE WILL SPARK MOVE TO ELECTRIC CARS; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: INVENTOR SAYS ONE U.S. AUTO MAKER IS PAYING HIM TO TEST HIS 
PATENTED IDEA, AND THAT HE'S NEGOTIATING WITH ANOTHER COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Daniel W. McGee says he's found the way to make electric-powered cars 
commonplace in America. He claims to have invented a hybrid method of merging 
an electric turbine with an existing internal-combustion engine and a computer 
that could power a full-size car cheaper and with less pollution but with just 
as much pep as conventional cars. 
</P>
<P>
McGee is chairman of a tiny company called American Motion Systems Inc. that is 
based in Iowa but is moving to Camarillo, where it has an office. McGee said 
he's sharing his invention first with U.S. auto makers, not the Japanese or 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
He says one U.S. auto maker is paying him under contract to test his invention 
and that he's in talks with another auto maker, but he has agreed not to 
identify the companies. He also said the invention is patented and that he is 
negotiating with the auto makers on development fees and royalties on future 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a zealot, but I personally would like to see the American 
manufacturers back on top," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But McGee's idea hasn't gotten out of the garage yet. He's never put his new 
engine into a car and driven it to prove it works. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are hundreds of other designs for electric cars, which make 
the odds very long that McGee's invention will become standard equipment in 
mass-produced cars. 
</P>
<P>
Car makers, researchers and garage inventors have been tinkering with electric 
cars for decades, yet the vehicles are still experimental. Auto makers are 
under growing federal and local pressure to build cars in the 1990s that spew 
out fewer smog-creating emissions, and experts agree some type of electric car 
likely will be one of the alternative designs. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., with resources in the billions of dollars, has been 
working for months with AeroVironment Inc. in Monrovia to build an electric car 
that could be mass produced. Last week, GM said it was proceeding with 
development of the car, named the Impact, but it would not say when or how the 
car would be built for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Even if GM or another auto maker considers his invention, McGee has lots of 
competition. "There are probably several hundred hybrid inventions and 
developments going on around the world" related to electric cars, said Paul 
MacCready, president of AeroVironment. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokesman David Sloan said McGee contacted the company late last year, but 
that GM does not have a contract with him. That leaves Ford and Chrysler. David 
Makowiec, a Ford spokesman in the area of inventions and developments brought 
to Ford, said he has nothing in his files regarding McGee or AMS. 
</P>
<P>
McGee, 42, said that for the first time, the companies face regulatory orders 
to produce cars with significantly lower emissions. Some versions of the 
pending federal clean-air bill, for instance, would require auto makers 
starting in the mid-1990s to build cars that run on alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
McGee said the car makers want that timetable pushed back because they don't 
have the technology to comply, and he is publicizing his invention "to 
basically cry, 'Bull! Here is the technology, let's see you guys hunker down, 
roll up your sleeves and give it to the American public.' " 
</P>
<P>
Recently developed electric cars -- those powered by electricity only -- suffer 
from several flaws. They are sluggish and have a range usually limited to less 
than 100 miles before the batteries need recharging. Recharging can take 
several hours. GM's Impact can accelerate much like conventional cars, but it 
has a range of only 120 miles. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, McGee's plan is to power a car with a conventional motorcycle 
engine connected to an electric turbine he has developed. There also would be a 
turbine in each wheel, 200 pounds of batteries in the trunk and a computer near 
the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
According to McGee's blueprint, the 25-pound steel turbine draws electricity 
from the batteries and starts the motorcycle engine. The engine then drives the 
turbine, which sends electrical power to the smaller turbines that drive each 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The computer governs the whole process and diverts excess electricity from the 
turbine back to the batteries, so they are constantly being recharged. That 
gives the car a range of 500 to 600 miles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of the engine and turbines also gives the car the equivalent of 
about 150 in peak horsepower, even though the motorcycle engine consumes less 
fuel than conventional auto engines, he said. Because the computer-turbine 
system applies power directly to the wheels, it also eliminates the need for a 
conventional transmission, brakes, differential and power-steering system, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot of the system is that the engine uses less fuel, emits one-third of 
the smog-producing hydrocarbons of a typical six-cylinder engine and weighs 
one-third less than conventional cars, he said. The turbine system also easily 
adapts to an internal combustion engine using alternative fuels, such as 
ethanol, or grain-alcohol, which would further cut the car's emissions, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter B. Bos, president of Polydyne Inc., a San Mateo research firm, said that 
even though he does not know the specifics of McGee's plan, McGee has the right 
approach in developing a hybrid turbine-combustion-engine format. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no technology I know of anywhere in which an all-electric vehicle can 
achieve the range of a conventional vehicle," mainly because "there is no 
battery right now that I know of that will be able to store sufficient energy 
for a 300- to 400-mile range," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
"A hybrid can do that; an all-electric vehicle cannot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McGee said his idea for a turbine-assisted car engine goes back a decade. In 
1982, he started his own firm, Magna Motive Industries, and moved to Fairfield, 
Iowa, because the state provided $150,000 in seed money. He started two other 
companies, Magnetics Research International and AMS, to raise funds for 
specific projects, and now plans to merge the three and move his operation to 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The three firms, which only do research and development work, will have about 
$1 million in revenue this year, said McGee, adding that he has about $500,000 
personally invested in his businesses. He's also working on similar turbines 
that can make motors in washing machines, generators and refrigerators more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
But what's to stop the U.S. auto makers from simply ignoring his technology? 
"Nothing," he said. "But if, in fact, that's how it goes, we'll use the 
revenues from these other market areas and become an auto manufacturer." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, since Walter P. Chrysler started his own company in 1925, which is 
the most recent successful, mass-production car company, Henry J. Kaiser, 
Preston Tucker, Malcolm Bricklin and John DeLorean have tried and failed to 
sustain their own car companies. 
</P>
<P>
But McGee said, "If you have a commanding technological lead, . . . I think 
it's quite feasible to get into the automobile business."

GAO LABORING MIGHTILY TO REFORM AGRICULTURE DEPT.; 
</P>
<P>
BUREAUCRACY: CONGRESSIONAL WATCHDOG MAY HAVE BITTEN OFF MORE THAN IT CAN CHEW 
WITH HUGE AGENCY MIRED IN INERTIA, WORK-FORCE PROBLEMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Congressional watchdogs continue to nip at the Agriculture Department in hopes 
the creaky old agency will modernize itself before the 20th Century ends. 
</P>
<P>
But the structure and inertia of USDA are formidable. Attempts have been made 
for 45 years -- largely unsuccessful -- to streamline departmental field 
structure and management. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has been 
studying USDA organization and departmental inhibitions for at least two years. 
A preliminary report was issued in December. 
</P>
<P>
Formal responses to GAO's analysis will be sought from departmental agencies 
and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter when the final report is ready later 
in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GAO has followed up its initial review with a supplemental 
report to Yeutter about the need for improved work-force planning in his 
department. Such planning should be mandatory, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
At its simplest, work-force planning means getting the right people in the 
right jobs, now and over the long haul. The object is to deliver government 
services to the public, efficiently and economically. 
</P>
<P>
The problems involve 36 agencies that carry out the department's policies and 
programs. In 1988, the GAO said, those functions cost taxpayers more than $44 
billion and required the services of 110,000 full-time employees in more than 
15,000 places around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"USDA agencies are experiencing problems recruiting highly skilled workers, 
providing adequate training to employees, developing effective managers, and 
managing a culturally diverse work force," the latest report said. "These 
problems are longstanding, pervasive and will likely continue given present 
trends in USDA and in the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
The growing importance of food safety, water quality and biotechnology requires 
more scientists in USDA's work force. Yet a shortage of scientists generally, 
as well as competition from the private sector, put USDA at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report said, agencies within USDA "sometimes find themselves 
competing against each other for people from the same job occupations, a 
condition which is counterproductive from a departmental standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Another inhibitor has been the lack of a departmental recruiting program. Each 
USDA agency goes its own way and generally does not refer unneeded applicants 
to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that the department's Office of Personnel has 
recently contracted to develop a videotape for recruiting new employees. 
</P>
<P>
"As the agricultural economy becomes more consumer-driven than 
production-oriented, USDA needs employees with backgrounds in marketing 
management to supplement the skills of their other employees trained in the 
agricultural sciences," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
When the GAO looked at employee training, there were many indications of 
"poorly or inadequately trained staff" in a number of areas. Also, the report 
cited "continuing problems in achieving and maintaining an ethnically diverse 
work force" of women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
A major GAO complaint is that department agencies generally address only a 
single year's needs to patch up a problem when long-range remedies are in 
order. This has been apparent in the Farmers Home Administration and the 
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, for example.

DIRT ON THE BEACH BOYS 
</P>
<P>
ABC is sure to point out that its Sunday-night movie, "The Story of the Beach 
Boys: Summer Dreams," is based on an unauthorized biography, and that the music 
in the film is not performed by the Beach Boys. With that disclaimer out of the 
way, the TV drama plunges into a tale of betrayal, sudden stardom, family 
control, paternity suits, divorce, death and personal battles with drugs and 
alcohol. It all starts in 1961, when Dennis Wilson, played by Bruce Greenwood, 
privately urges shy brother Brian to quit writing Lawrence Welkish music with 
their father and give rock 'n' roll a try. 
</P>
<P>
"The Story of the Beach Boys: Summer Dreams" Sunday 9-11 p.m. ABC

Stephanie Zimbalist stars as a woman presumed dead for 15 years who returns to 
the family fold right before a large inheritance is due in the CBS "Hallmark 
Hall of Fame" presentation, "Caroline?" The problem is, not everyone is 
convinced of Caroline's identity. The film co-stars George Grizzard as the 
workaholic father, Pamela Reed as the suspicious stepmother, Patricia Neal and 
Dorothy McGuire. The movie, from veteran TV director Joseph Sargent, is based 
on E.L. Konigsburg's novel, "Father's Arcane Daughter."

Man and His Music" to 1988's "Concert for the Americas." In the specials, he 
shares the spotlight with entertainers such as Lucille Ball, Cary Grant, Orson 
Welles, Princess Grace, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jr. As part of its 
regular "Sunday Night Showcase," the Disney Channel is presenting a different 
Sinatra special every other month. The first, "Ol' Blue Eyes is Back," debuted 
in 1973 when Sinatra came out of retirement. Gene Kelly joins him singing "New 
York, New York," "Me and My Gal" and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

POLITICAL INTRIGUE 
</P>
<P>
The story of Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev is a political epic with the 
sweep of Tolstoy and the turmoil of Dostoyevsky. We have already absorbed 
perestroika and glasnost into our vocabulary, but do we really know what those 
words mean? "Inside Gorbachev's USSR" with Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent 
Hedrick Smith is a four-part PBS series that provides viewers with a complete, 
intimate and factual portrait of the world events that are shaking the Soviet 
system to its foundations. The opener, "The Taste of Democracy," illustrates 
the exhilaration of reform and renewal as Gorbachev and his generation try to 
exorcise the ghosts of Stalin and Brezhnev.

For five years, Charles Keating Jr. thwarted government and regulatory 
interventions to prevent his troubled Lincoln Savings from sinking $2.5 billion

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: THE JOKER'S WILD ON 'BATMAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN FANTAZIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Joker plans to laugh all the way to the bank -- well, actually the Federal 
Depository -- on "Batman" (Sunday at 2 p.m. on KTTV). 
</P>
<P>
Blowing open the depository and cleaning the place out is a big job. 
</P>
<P>
It'll take two villains-the Joker (Cesar Romero) and Catwoman (Eartha Kitt)-to 
pull it off in "The Funny Feline Felonies." The pair return in the second part, 
called "The Joke's on the Catwoman" (2:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Catwoman didn't get involved just because the Joker needed a hand; at the time, 
the show itself did too. During the series' third and final season, villains 
were teamed in episodes to try to boost the sagging ratings of the once-wildly 
popular show. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how many villains are on the same team, they can't keep a good 
Batman down. The Caped Crusader (Adam West) and his colleagues, Robin (Burt 
Ward) and Batgirl (Yvonne Craig), triumph as always with their wits, moral 
strength-and enough gadgets to put Ronco out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Watch for a mistake in the episode: The Joker is surprised to learn that the 
heroes are alive, but the scene that shows how he tried to kill them was cut 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the week, there is no pairing of guest villains in "The Impractical 
Joker/The Joker's Provokers" (Saturday at 2 p.m. on KTTV), which is from the 
second season. The Joker does his dirty work with only a couple of thugs and 
his girlfriend, Cornelia (played by Kathy Kersh, who at the time was Ward's 
wife).

RELIVING THE ACHILLE LAURO TRAGEDY; 
</P>
<P>
NEW MINISERIES ON HIJACKING USES THE ACTUAL SHIP AND ITS CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All in the name of realism. That's why 10%-$1 million-of the budget of "Voyage 
of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair" was spent to rent the real Achille Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
For those with short memories: The Achille Lauro was the Italian cruise ship 
hijacked five years ago in the Mediterranean by four Palestinian terrorists who 
murdered Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American. 
</P>
<P>
"Voyage of Terror" stars Burt Lancaster and Eva Marie Saint as Klinghoffer and 
his wife, Marilyn. The two-part movie airs Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m. on 
KTLA. This first presentation of the syndicated Tribune Premiere Network is a 
German, Italian and French co-production that will air in Europe later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Re-creating the events for the $10-million miniseries proved to be not only 
costly but difficult and even dangerous for the producers, crew and cast. 
Troubles started with acquiring use of the actual Achille Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
"When the ship was owned by the (Italian) government, there was going to be no 
cost," said George Paris, vice president of Tribune Entertainment. "But then 
the government sold the ship, and it became a commercial venture. The new owner 
obviously couldn't give up the ship and interrupt its travel itinerary." 
</P>
<P>
The original captain served as the technical adviser, and several of the same 
crew members worked for the film's voyage and appear as themselves. For one 
week, the production took to sea on the same route as the ill-fated journey 
with 300 extras to film the violent sequences and terrorist activities. For the 
following 2 1/2 weeks, the crew and staff shared the ship with real tourists. 
</P>
<P>
David Lawrence, the American producer, remembered the original crew members 
were distraught when it came time to re-enact the hijacking. "There were tears 
rolling down their cheeks," he said. "We were re-creating things they had lived 
through." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very eerie," said Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Before production began on "Voyage of Terror," Lawrence talked with a good 
friend who was involved with "The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro," NBC's 
version of the event that had been shot in Australia and aired in February, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"He was amazed we had gotten the Achille Lauro and had gotten the complete 
cooperation of the Italian government," he said. "They had been warned to keep 
away from this project, because it was a life-threatening situation." 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many political aspects to consider," said Italian producer 
Fabrizio Castellani. "For instance, the American partner cared about the 
emotional aspects of the event, and the Italian partner looked to the political 
aspects. It was a very delicate subject." 
</P>
<P>
The producers took every precaution against terrorist attacks during the 
filming. "There were guards on duty," said Paris. The cast was also not allowed 
to disembark at several ports. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept the whole thing under wraps," said Lawrence. "When Burt Lancaster and 
Eva Marie Saint came to Rome-they are big stars there-we never released any 
information about their arrival. There were no interviews, and that held true 
until they were safe." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, said Lawrence, some of the Egyptian and Israeli actors were 
hassled by the port authorities in various cities. "I guess they had a right to 
be fearful if they thought they could possibly be terrorists," he said. "We had 
an American actor who was Arabic by heritage who was awakened by the 
authorities in the middle of the night. We finally convinced them he was 
legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
The production also received a "fair amount" of pressure from governmental 
agencies of several countries because they thought "Voyage of Terror" showed 
the terrorists in a favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
"I heartily disagree with that," said Lawrence. "We are not saying the 
terrorists were good guys. We try to express their viewpoint. It's very 
difficult when you are juggling international situations." 
</P>
<P>
"Great care was taken not to paint a picture of the terrorists as four 
irresponsible terrorists who were out just to terrorize, but four young 
people-these were all kids in their teens and early 20s-who felt they were on a 
mission to help their countrymen," said Paris. "There was great care taken in 
trying to paint an accurate picture of the events, feelings and attitudes of 
the people involved. Those four kids looked at themselves not as terrorists but 
as patriots."

WILL REGGIE BE A HIT IN THE BOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG, TIMES SPORTS COLUMNIST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dispenser, in his time, of 563 home runs, Reggie Jackson always rejected 
appraisals of baseball scientists that he was a hazard in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie's vision, it was charged, was faulty, preventing him from tracking, and 
scooping up deftly, ground balls. He wore glasses when he played, but insisted 
he needed them Ronly to pick up the spin of curve balls when I am at bat." 
</P>
<P>
Today, at 43, Reggie has shifted to the booth, still wearing glasses to pick up 
the spin, and, viewers hope, everything else going on in the 55 Angels games 
that KTLA is televising this year. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie is teamed with another former big leaguer, Joe Torre, forming an 
amalgamation the station insists has no on-air commitment to the home side. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not under wraps," says Joe Quasarano, director of sports and 
production for KTLA the last 13 years. "They have total latitude to say what 
they feel needs saying." 
</P>
<P>
The outsider arches an eyebrow, always wary of such manifestoes, but Reggie 
vouches for the policy, leading you to conclude that if he talks as good a game 
on the air as he does off, he may be palatable. 
</P>
<P>
At the local level across the republic, not too many baseball broadcasters are. 
In his experience on television, Jackson did baseball sporadically for ABC but 
began for that network in 1974 doing "Superstars." At the time, he tilled an 
oar in right field for the Oakland A's, Charlie Finley, proprietor. 
</P>
<P>
Doing an interview on "Superstars" with Hall of Famer Ernie Banks, Reggie was 
getting instructions through his earpiece from Don Ohlmeyer, then producer of 
the show. It got confusing for Reggie-so much so that he removed his earpiece 
on camera. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ohlmeyer screamed at me afterward," recalled Jackson, "I said to him, 'If 
you don't get off my butt, I'm going back to Oakland. No one screams at me but 
Charlie Finley.' " 
</P>
<P>
From that fragile start, television had to get better for Reggie, who since has 
done commercials hawking toothpaste, automobiles, TV sets, margarine, even a 
candy bar bearing his name but destined to enter into rest. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie also has acted on TV, doing, among other things, an episode of "Love 
Boat" in which he struck out with the girl but helped a kid who had problems 
with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you feel is your function as a baseball analyst?" Reggie is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"My function," he responds, "is to make people, including women and children 
new to baseball, understand everything that's happening on the field. I must do 
that in a clear, concise way. If I stumble, don't blame it on inexperience. Say 
I stink." 
</P>
<P>
"What's your policy on talking about players who stink?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I played in the majors 21 years," he answers. "I was attacked plenty by 
critics. I got it for striking out. I got it for botching plays. I never 
objected to criticism I had coming. I fired back only at cheap shots. In the 
booth today, I criticize but guard against delivering the cheap shots I hated 
when I played." 
</P>
<P>
"What, for instance, constitutes a cheap shot?" 
</P>

"Say I would work a Dodger game that involves Orel Hershiser," he answers, 
citing an unlikely situation. "Hershiser is beaten. I don't say that for $2.7 
million a year he should pitch better than that. Once the game starts, the 
money isn't related to what happens." 
</P>
<P>
At Arizona State, where, you would guess, he majored in runs batted in, Reggie 
actually earned a degree in biology. The son of a Philadelphia tailor, Martinez 
Jackson, Reggie credits his ability to articulate to his father. 
</P>
<P>
"My father never allowed me to talk in his presence in street vernacular," 
Reggie once confided. "When I would say 'uh-uh,' he would lecture, 'Reggie, you 
mean no.' And he would never let me get away with saying 'yeh.' With careful 
enunciation, he would say yes." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling life's boulevard, Reggie learned to say a lot of things he shouldn't 
have, earning his detractors, but his business acumen seems to be established. 
</P>
<P>
He was the first player in modern baseball to work for a piece of the gate. 
Signing with the Angels in 1982, he manipulated a bonus of 50 cents for each 
ticket sold beyond 2,400,000. When Angel attendance zoomed to a club record 
2,807,360, Reggie turned a nifty buck. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of KTLA's enlisting him for the Angel games this year is 
ill-concealed. The hope is that one heading for the Hall of Fame will capture 
the fancy of viewers who watched him entertain in the majors for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The station, though, must remember the sensitivity of Reggie. He no longer has 
Charlie Finley to go back to, but you scream at him, and he'll go back to 
someone.

CAMCORDER SALES ON UPSWING AS ABC SHOW HITS BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Television audiences aren't the only ones amused by "America's Funniest Home 
Videos," ABC's smash TV show featuring home-grown video clips sent in by 
viewers. The manufacturers of portable video cameras, better known as 
camcorders, are laughing too-all he way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
In February, "Videos" zipped by "Roseanne" and "The Cosby Show" in fast-forward 
to finish No. 1 in the national ratings, where it has hovered ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The very next month, a normally slow sales month for camcorders, a whopping 
222,417 units were sold to distributors across the country, up 38% from the 
same time a year ago, according to the Electronics Industry Assn. Analysts are 
calling March one of the greatest sales months in the history of camcorders. 
</P>
<P>
"I think slowly but surely camcorder sales will increase as a result of 
'America's Funniest Home Videos,' " said Tom Adams, entertainment consultant 
for the Carmel-based Paul Kagan Associates. "TV is the great trend-setter. The 
use of products on programs are what enshrine them as part of the American 
family scene. There hasn't really been a show based around the use of a product 
before, probably because there hasn't been a product as much fun as a 
camcorder." 
</P>
<P>
There is no conclusive link between the popularity of "Videos" on the airwaves 
and the recent surge of camcorder sales in video stores. Sales were on the rise 
before "Videos" premiered, and local retailers contacted for this story said 
they see no indication that the new TV show is influencing camcorder sales. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some who say that the hit Sunday night TV show, which awards 
$10,000 a week to the most wacky home video, may be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any evidence except for the industry figures," editor David 
Lachenbruch of the industry newsletter Television Digest said. "March was a 
record month. I can't say that 'America's Funniest Home Videos' was 
responsible, but the show will ultimately make some kind of impact on the 
market. People are becoming more and more conscious of camcorders because of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, EIA forecast a modest 8.5% increase in camcorder sales. But 
that was before "America's Funniest Home Videos" debuted on Jan. 14. On the 
strength of March sales orders, which reflect heavy consumer buying during 
January and February, year-to-date sales are already up by about 19%-more than 
double what the association predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"In my gut, I have a feeling that we're somewhat responsible for the rise in 
camcorder sales," "Videos" producer Vin De Bona said. "When we watch the videos 
that come in, we hear a lot of side comments. We have a video where a kid 
sitting in a kitchen sink accidentally gets a mouthful of soapy water during 
his bath. Right away, the mother says, "We have to send this to 'America's 
Funniest Home Videos.' You have to be able to translate those kind of 
background voices into the realization that the camcorder is becoming an 
important part of the family." 
</P>
<P>
In the video hardware market, camcorders are a major growth product, while VCR 
sales have been on the decline. About 10% of the 92 million homes in the United 
States have a camcorder. In 1985, 517,000 units were sold by manufacturers to 
distributors. That number swelled to 2.3 million by the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The producers of "Videos" are doing their part to ensure that the camcorder 
explosion continues to blossom. ABC and "CA, the show's sponsor, regularly 
distribute coupons to retailers enticing video-camera buyers to send in their 
funny home-video footage. Host Bob Saget gives TV viewers tips on how to 
properly operate a camcorder. 
</P>
<P>
"CA camcorders have even been distributed to ABC's top 50 affiliate stations so 
that viewers can come in and check them out for no charge. The gimmick is 
supposed to provide home-video yucks for the TV show, but it also works as a 
promotion for "CA. 
</P>
<P>
"(TVideos') does give people one more reason to buy a camcorder," Adams said. 
"If people were thinking about buying one, it tips the scales in their favor. A 
show like that sort of legitimizes the expense to some extent. It gives people 
the impression that everyone has a camcorder and is taking pictures of their 
kids, and therefore you're a jerk if you don't have one too." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers will soon have more incentive to buy camcorders and stock up on 
videotape, as the video bandwagon shifts into high gear. Make sure the lens cap 
is off your camcorder so you won't miss R$1,000,000 Video Challenge," 
"Camcorder Kids," "The Amazing World of Video" and the Spanish-language "La 
Vida Es Una Risa"Qall new TV shows now in development.

California is fortunate to have one of the best laws for durable power of 
attorney for health care ("Is a Living Will Enough?" Mar. 4). Early on, my 
alert young lawyer suggested that we review its provisions together. I was in a 
convalescent center at the time, so he made requisite arrangements for a 
federal ombudsman to assist.

<TEXT>
<P>
In January, 1981, when I was a miserably unhappy graduate student at MIT, one 
of my friends dragged me to a lecture by Harlan Ellison. I didn't want to go; I 
wasn't in the mood to listen to some rich, successful writer spout cliches. 
</P>
<P>
I was too busy wallowing in my career crisis. 
</P>
<P>
What I heard that night was an astonishing, 3 1/2-hour web of interlocking 
stories delivered at high speed and without notes, a positive frenzy of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
His message was simple: Nothing less than your best should ever be good enough. 
He was totally unimpressed by the mighty MIT reputation. "What, you expect the 
world handed to you just because you've got a brain? Use it!" he said. "Do 
something!" He also spoke eloquently about the pleasure and pain of writing. 
"When I'm really cooking, it's like I've got lightning bolts shooting out of my 
fingers into the typewriter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, I've finished my degree and started my own career as a writer. A 
few times I've even felt those lightning bolts. I know it sounds unspeakably 
corny, but that lecture changed my life. Thanks, Harlan.

IN THE MARKET for a Giant Death's Head roach? A Horned Rhinoceros beetle? Maybe 
a lavender grasshopper? Cathy Endfield can help. 
</P>
<P>
In film and video circles, she's known as the butterfly lady. Endfield is a 
specialist in insect art. Her Sherman Oaks home is crammed with insects -- 
thousands of them, stashed in drawers, mounted and hoarded in bags. Endfield 
rents her bugs to film studios, special-effects shops, photographers and anyone 
else with such a hankering. 
</P>
<P>
Recently Endfield supplied insects for "Arachnophobia," an Amblin-Hollywood 
Pictures production. But creating art pieces by incorporating these creatures 
into collages and assemblages is her true avocation. "I'm into insect art," the 
butterfly lady says.

THE SUNDANCE KID STRIKES AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
AT A TIME when society seems to move us further from some basic rhythms of our 
heritage and environment, we are pleased to offer products that remind us of 
both." So reads a line from Robert Redford in his Spring, 1990, Sundance 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the items in the catalogue's collection are Sundance exclusives, and 
most are carved, crafted, forged, woven, stamped, dyed and painted by hand by 
local craftspeople, including members of the Navajo, Tarahumara and Huichol 
Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwestern look dominates -- in everything from sterling-silver collar 
tips and jewelry, stoneware and pottery, Navajo-rug-design note pads, artwork 
and furniture, including a custom-crafted headboard of natural bird's-eye maple 
inlaid with ebony and green-stained poplar, and a Navajo sand-painting table. 
</P>
<P>
The Sundance catalogue, like the Institute itself, is named after Sundance 
General Store proprietor Robert Redford's character in the classic 1969 
picture, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." Also like the Institute, the 
catalogue is dedicated to emerging artists in all media, and a portion of the 
proceeds from sales goes toward the development of new talent in the arts and 
helping to preserve the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sundance catalogue is available by telephone; call (800) 422-2770.

STILL STORING THOSE oil paintings in the attic? The vintage Bordeaux in the 
kitchen cabinet? The Los Angeles Fine Arts &amp; Wine Storage Co. has a better 
idea. Designed to store anything from Picassos to port in temperature- and 
humidity-controlled compartments, this high-tech storage facility just opened 
in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to offer first-class protection for any collectible," says Bo 
Zarnegin, whose own family's art collections inspired the warehouse idea. 
</P>
<P>
The art compartments are spacious enough to hold anything from paintings to 
statues and large-scale 3-D pieces. In addition to the large walk-in 
compartments, which can expand even beyond 20 feet square, there's a 
comfortable art-viewing and wine-tasting room where collectors and enophiles 
can trade, sell or sample one anothers' wares. The Los Angeles Fine Arts &amp; 
Wine Storage Co. also features around-the-clock electronic security service and 
personal-access key cards. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors of other types of valuables can lease compartments to keep furs, 
rugs, film, tapes and legal files safe from theft and the elements.

SHE MADE IT OUT OF CLAY

<P>
ALTHOUGH THE technique, called millefiori, is one the Venetians perfected in 
their creation of intricate patterns in glass, artist Martha Breen's clocks and 
picture frames look as though they were inspired as much by refrigerator 
cookies or sushi as by glass beads. Breen makes her dazzling pieces from 
polyform clay, mixing her own shades (about a dozen per piece), which she 
combines in bold strokes. 
</P>
<P>
The process consists of, first, forming long "canes" (as in candy canes) into 
patterns -- checkerboards, stars, stripes, pinwheels, flowers. Making the canes 
is the difficult part; it takes weeks to produce the proper designs and colors. 
Then, just as with making cookies, Breen slices the clay and arranges the 
pieces, cheek by jowl, into wild faces and picture frames. A bit of baking 
(again like refrigerator cookies), and they're finished. The result is a bit 
folkloric and a bit psychedelic. The clocks, which are about 5 to 6 inches 
square (some have pendulums), sell for $130 to $165; the frames, which stand 4 
to 7 inches high, go for $37 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Breen's clocks and frames are available at New Stone Age, 8407 W. 3rd 
St., Los Angeles; (213) 658-5969. ELLEN MELINKOFF

By HARALD HAHN is president of the Burton Way Homeowners' Assn., active in the 
Beverly Center area and now in curbing development of the Farmers' Market. He 
told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My main concern (with Farmers' Market) is the impact on the residential 
community. It's going to be major in terms of traffic, congestion and crime. 
</P>
<P>
The uses that they're proposing for the site include a couple of hotels, a lot 
of retail, office buildings, a major sports center and gym. One of the worst 
uses is usually a gym; they are the biggest traffic generators . . . There is a 
direct connection between the number of liquor licenses in an area and the 
amount of crime. And can we really support another major shopping center less 
than a mile from the Beverly Center? . . . There is no way that adequate 
(traffic) capacity can be developed at this site, with the surrounding streets 
already at gridlock. But these people (A.F. Gilmore Co., owners of Farmers' 
Market) . . . have been there a long time and have too much political support. 
There's obviously going to be some sort of compromise.

IT SIMPLY WENT MUCH TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari finally got it through Washington's 
thick skull that he's very, very angry about the latest twist in the difficult 
effort between the two countries to cooperate in the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
The flap stems from the arrest of a Mexican citizen suspected of complicity in 
the 1985 murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. Humberto Alvarez Machain, 
who U.S. authorities allege was present when Camarena was tortured to death by 
drug lords, was arrested by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents April 
3. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA says the arrest took place at the airport in El Paso, Tex. But 
Alvarez's attorneys claim he was kidnaped in Mexico and flown to El Paso by 
bounty hunters paid by DEA -- and The Times has found witnesses who verify that 
story. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh has said that no DEA agents based in Mexico 
were involved in Alvarez's abduction, but he's yet to explain precisely what 
DEA's role in the incident was. The delay creates political problems for 
Salinas, as cooperative a Mexican president as Washington has dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Salinas went out of his way on two different occasions last week to 
tell the U.S. government that he had better start getting some satisfactory 
answers fast. In a Los Angeles speech Monday, Salinas told his audience the 
United States would have to respect Mexican laws if it expected Mexico to 
cooperate in the drug war. Thursday, a meeting between Vice President Dan 
Quayle and Salinas ran overtime because the Mexican president was lecturing 
Quayle on the Alvarez incident. Quayle told reporters later he tried to assure 
Salinas that President Bush "respects the sovereignty of Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
That's a good start, but not enough. Thornburgh must go public with everything 
the Justice Department knows about the Alvarez arrest. If any U.S. officials 
acted illegally, they must be disciplined. The attorney general must also 
rethink the new policy that allows U.S. officials to "snatch" criminals wanted 
in the United States from foreign countries, a dangerous precedent. Would 
Washington just bite its tongue if foreign agents came here to "snatch" a U.S. 
citizen they wanted? Besides, the very existence of such a policy feeds the 
suspicion in Mexico that we will make arrests on their territory when we please 
and no matter what they think or what their laws say. That's macho law 
enforcement, but it's no way to get cooperation.

<P>
MANNING DRUG WAR BARRICADES WITH A 'KICK IN THE PANTS' STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Simon, Scott Simon is host and chief correspondent of National Public 
Radio's Saturday news show, Weekend Edition. He interviewed Bennett in the 
director's office. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William J. Bennett is advertised as being "blunt, bluff and outspoken." Yet 
during a nine-year career in official Washington, the National Drug Policy 
Director has rarely aimed his rhetoric at a target his boss -- the President -- 
was not delighted to see absorb the blow. If Bennett is the bull in the china 
shop, he steers clear of knocking over the high-ticket merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
As Ronald Reagan's secretary of education, he criticized union teachers, who 
have had a tendency -- depressing from the Republican perspective -- to endorse 
national Democratic candidates. He defended cuts in student aid by suggesting 
the recipients could "divest" themselves of stereos, automobiles and beach 
vacations -- an exclamation which, whatever its wisdom as a policy to cover the 
cost of higher education, may have been popular among thousands of parents 
aggravated by the escalating aspirations of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett is 47. He is a Washington kid, who attended the prestigious St. 
Anselm's, then the more roughhouse Gonzaga Catholic High School. He went to 
Williams College rather then a Catholic university, on advice of a college 
counselor who told young Bennett he ought to exercise his rebellious spirit 
some place where it wouldn't challenge Catholic education. He graduated in 
1965, completed his doctorate in philosophy at the University of Texas, then 
spent a year teaching at the University of Southern Mississippi, where he was 
active in the civil-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
After acquiring another degree at Harvard, Bennett crossed the Charles River to 
teach and serve as an assistant to Boston University President John R. Silber, 
one of his professors at Texas. Bennett was known on campus as a popular 
professor and the fist on Silber's strong right arm -- the man who would escort 
military recruiters into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was 36 when he became president of the National Humanities Center in 
North Carolina. His campaign against what he identified as permissiveness in 
humanities studies brought him to the attention of activists in the Reagan 
Administration -- his was a scholarly voice enunciating some of the President's 
own unfootnoted suspicions of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was appointed chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities in 
1981, then became education secretary in 1984, after the Reagan Administration 
said the department should be closed. But not for the first or last time, 
Bennett's rhetoric enlarged the role he was given -- and made the department 
impossible to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
He left Washington in the fall of 1988 to write a book, give speeches and 
contemplate various importunings to run for office -- either a Senate seat from 
North Carolina or directly for President. Within three months, he was back, 
after letting the word circulate he was available for another round of 
underpaid government service. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett is married, has two young children and is prominently absent from 
official Washington social proceedings -- but is nonetheless reported by 
friends and observers to be the finest rock-and-roll dancer in the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Question: What is your current understanding as to why people take drugs that 
are a danger to them? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The thing you hear most often is: "Somebody told me to try it, to give 
me a boost and make me feel better." That is by people's own account. What does 
the analysis suggest? They (drugs) are powerful; they give an intense feeling 
of pleasure. Once you have taken it, you want to take it again. You never quite 
approach that first high, but you are always trying to. It is very deceptive; 
it's a lie, and I have been struck by how many people in treatment have talked 
about it as a lie and have even personalized it and have said "It is the Devil. 
It's Satan. It is the great deception.". . . 
</P>
<P>
And it is America -- we try different things. We are experimental people; we 
have money; permission was given 15 or 20 years ago. This is the underbelly of 
liberty. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When you talk to people going through treatment, what they want to get away 
from, as they describe it, is not the physical damage; it is what it is doing 
to their souls. . . . It is more material for the novelist or the poet than for 
the clinician. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Given that understanding, how do you explain to people the logic of a 
Administration budget that is 70% devoted to interdiction and law enforcement, 
and 30% to treatment programs? 
</P>
<P>
A: By first of all pointing out that there is a lot more money for everything 
than there was before. I will be damned if I will be criticized by any member 
of Congress, Republican or Democrat -- it is usually Democrat -- for saying 
insufficient funds for education and treatment when we have raised them 70% or 
80%. . . . Second, the federal government has responsibilities for interdiction 
of drugs that no state has. We pay for all of the methods. We pay for all the 
work in South America, and that is expensive work. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that we have failed to address treatment and education that bothers 
the critics. It is that we believe in law enforcement, too. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Let me calculatedly use a catch phrase. What experience have you had over 
the past year, with both the processes of interdiction and the criminal justice 
system, that gives you confidence that "throwing money at the problem" on that 
side of it is going to improve the situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I have no more confidence that simply throwing money at it will do any 
good. A wise expenditure of money, I think, will do some good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What still is not understood, and I guess I have to take some responsibility 
for not making this plain enough, is the relationship between law enforcement 
and treatment. Many people in treatment would not be there had they not been 
arrested. Coercion is one of the most effective things we can use to get them 
into treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you have a problem with what is sometimes called "treatment on demand." 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh sure. Yes, it suggests that the determination of what treatment and when 
should be left to the person on drugs, the person who demands it. And that is 
all wrong. That person has made terrible mistakes. That person is not to be 
relied on for either determining when he should have treatment, or the kind of 
treatment he has . . . because people on drugs, again, will have a bad 
experience, they will crash; they will want treatment; they will demand it. 
They will sign up to some list, they will go in for two days, they will say 
"I'm fine" and they will go back out on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We interviewed Dr. Michael Smith of Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx last 
summer. He said one of the tragedies of not having treatment on demand 
available was that he felt that somebody who was an addict walked in and needed 
to feel something. And if all he could give them was a letter saying "We will 
get in contact with you when we have a space available," they risk losing that 
person. 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, again, if one could snap one's fingers and create 80,000 professional 
treatment experts overnight, one might be inclined to do it. But one can't. Now 
in the rhetoric of treatment on demand, what people are trying to do is shift 
the blame from where it belongs -- on people who are using drugs -- to the 
government's unwillingness to provide more treatment. A) Government is not 
unwilling to provide more treatment, (but it) can't do it overnight. B) People 
who want to help themselves can. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are people to blame for their own drug problems? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. If you take personal responsibility out, you are finished, and 
treatment is finished, too. All good treatment programs emphasize personal 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But isn't there a difference between emphasizing personal responsibility, 
and blaming someone if they haven't yet assembled the qualities necessary to -- 
</P>
<P>
 A: You don't have to kick them around and blame them and shout at them. But 
you do have to get them to accept that they are responsible for what they did, 
that they can't blame anyone else. . . . No, they cannot be allowed to point 
fingers at the system, the government, their mother or their environment. And 
if they do, you are just delaying their recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You recently assessed the progress made on the struggle against drugs in the 
District of Columbia as "spotty." 
</P>
<P>
A: That's correct. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Now in the District of Columbia, as opposed to, say, Los Angeles or Chicago, 
the federal government has the power of the purse and ultimate responsibilities 
it doesn't enjoy in other municipalities. Why hasn't there been more progress? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, we laid it out in our report. A number of things have been done, and a 
few things remain to be done. . . . It is going to take time -- more time than 
a lot of people think, more time than some people are prepared to give me or 
anyone else in this job. 
</P>
<P>
Q: More time than what you thought a year ago? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. No, I said a year ago, it is going to be very hard to make progress. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How many people on your professional staff are black? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't count by race. I resent the question, frankly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The New York Review of Books says that of the 65 people who are at work here 
on your professional staff, six are black. 
</P>
<P>
 A: The New York Review of Books counts by race; I don't. I had this fight 
before at the NEH (National Endowment for the Humanities) and at the Department 
of Education, and both times told whoever it was -- EEOC (Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission) -- to go to hell. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Well, I don't raise the question on the basis of whether there is an EEOC 
guideline that ought to be observed. . . . You don't believe that it has any 
legitimate bearing on the kind of perspective your office is bringing to -- 
</P>
<P>
 A: That is not a black-and-white issue. This is a colorblind issue. I am very 
pleased to see the strong black support of President Bush and particularly 
President Bush's initiative on drugs. You know, a lot of black Americans 
approve of what we are doing. If you were to say "white liberals," I think I 
would agree that probably most white liberals are critical. . . . But we have 
support, according to the New York Times, 46%, 49% -- very high rating among 
blacks on our drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing is now I talk to black people. I didn't keep count, but I go 
into the city, 43 of them, and I go into communities, and essentially what they 
tell me is "Do what you are doing." Except they are little more bullish on law 
enforcement than I am. 
</P>
<P>
Q: This is a bit of a personal question, but it has been part of the public 
record that has been examined. May I ask, are you still smoking? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I am not smoking and no more personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did that experience (quitting smoking) give you greater insight or feeling 
into the difficulty of quitting an addiction? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, sure. No, it is hard, sure it is hard. But so what? What does one 
assume from that? Should I draw from that conclusion that it is hard to get off 
drugs? Sure, it is hard to get off drugs. Everybody knows that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You are a man of self-esteem, and respected in the community, and yet it was 
still difficult to bring yourself to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, Dr. (Herbert) Kleber (Yale psychiatrist and Bennett's deputy 
director), tells me that nicotine addiction is harder than any of the others, 
it is still the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did it give you any greater feeling for people who were -- 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have tons of feeling for people. It is not my style to stand up and emote 
and say "I have tremendous sympathy for people." My job is to act in ways that 
will help them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
More people on drugs need a kick in the pants than a bleeding-heart drug czar, 
and people in treatment will tell you that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think that Jesse Jackson, for example, is contributing a great deal 
on this subject? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think he is contributing a great deal. I think he could. I think he 
could probably do more than just anybody in the country, given his abilities 
and his rhetorical powers in certain parts of the country and in certain 
communities where he is revered, I think he could make a tremendous 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is Jackson not doing? 
</P>
<P>
A: What is he doing? . . . He gives the occasional speech. . . . He had the 
opportunity to step into this and come up with a plan like the rest of us, if 
he would run for mayor. He passed, he walked away, went to the rhetorical 
sidelines. He is very good on that sideline, but it would be good to have him 
in the game, too. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is your analysis of why, in this most blessed of societies, a 
significant number of Americans are not only using dangerous drugs, but 
drinking excessively, smoking to their detriment, narcoticizing themselves 
against this society we live in? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, I don't have any profound notions about that. Overall, I think American 
society is probably the healthiest society in the world. There are a lot of 
people who engage in self-destructive behavior, hurting themselves physically, 
hurting themselves mentally. But Justice Holmes said it is a free society. You 
have a right to go to hell if you want to, up to a point. You can't bring other 
people with you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I think the sense that you want to have is that, you know, your cities become 
safer. It is not regarded as threatening to every, or almost every, child in 
America. That it doesn't eat up 30%-40% of municipal resources. To say we will 
be a drug-free America, there will be no drugs, is of course idle. What is an 
acceptable number? I don't know what an acceptable number is. What you do is 
keep it from spreading and then just keep pressuring. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there such a thing as an acceptable number? 
</P>
<P>
A: In public policy, I guess there isn't. Morally, there isn't. But in reality 
there is. You have to agree that there is some number where we are just going 
to have to live with, because there is probably not anything we can do about 
some number of people. No matter what you do, or what kind of treatment or 
education or sanctions, they are going to do drugs anyway until they die. 
</P>
<P>
This is a very hard business. Sober reality is very stark, unhappy things. This 
is not a happy job. People say, "Do you enjoy your work?" "Enjoy" is the wrong 
word. The work is damn well worth doing, it is certainly engaging. Enjoy? A lot 
of carnage. 
</P>
<P>
Q: On the one hand, it seems as if the past year has increased your knowledge 
of the way in which people who are addicted to drugs suffer, and are 
victimized. And on the other hand, what you say is that they need a kick in the 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
 A: (A) lot of it is, which is what good treatment is. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is that how you want to be judged, as the man who has given the kick in the 
pants to people in need of help? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When deserved! These people are in hell, and you are getting a kick in the 
pants, all I'm saying is that they need to straighten their lives up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I can go with and sort of emote all over them, but I don't think that does them 
any good. This is what they do to themselves; a lot of people on drugs get 
together and they all feel sorry for themselves, just like a lot of alcoholics 
getting together. It's sort of like some of my family functions, when I was 
growing up, all these Irishmen getting together, all emoting all over, crying, 
feeling sorry for themselves, making excuses for each other. Come on, get on 
with your life!

TED KENNEDY WEATHERS FALL FROM GRACE IN THE '80S TO BECOME A FORCE IN THE

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 3:27 p.m. on Nov. 6, the senior senator from Massachusetts enters the Senate 
and strides down the aisle, thick frame filling his double-breasted suit. The 
chamber is vacant but for a few tourists and the pantheon of marble busts -- 
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr -- in their honored niches above the 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, the senator slumps in a chair, studying a black briefing book on 
HR 2710, a bill to raise the minimum wage for the first time since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He steps to the podium, 99 vacant desks behind him. Holding the notebook at 
arm's length, he recounts the compromise that congressional Democrats have 
fashioned with the White House Republicans. When deviating from the text, he 
stammers a bit. Hand gestures -- little chops and stabs -- substitute for 
oratorical pizazz. He drones. The gallery shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
But then the senator begins to describe the explosive growth in salaries for 
industry executives who have resisted better pay for their minimum wage 
workers, fat cats pulling in high six figures while opposing a six-bit raise. 
</P>
<P>
His voice rises, spiking the chamber with outrage and sarcasm. He is bellowing, 
to no one, but with the same vigor as if it were August, 1980, and Madison 
Square Garden were again crammed to the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
Having spoken his mind, he wheels up the aisle and exits through the double 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
To his innumerable critics, the image of Edward Moore Kennedy declaiming to a 
phantom audience is an apt metaphor for his long fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy began the 1980s with a sound thrashing at the hands of former President 
Jimmy Carter; his marriage ended in divorce, while tales of boozing and 
womanizing continued unabated; for six years he languished in the minority 
after Republicans captured the Senate; the decade was dominated by his 
ideological antithesis, former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
He personifies liberalism for a generation. But in 1990s America, that is a 
backhanded compliment at best. 
</P>
<P>
"After all is said and done," says Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater, "Ted 
Kennedy is still the man in American politics Republicans love to hate." 
</P>
<P>
At least some of the blame for liberalism's decline may be laid at his door, 
and he has been unable to articulate a compelling vision of America's future 
acceptable to a majority of the Democratic Party, much less the American 
electorate. Ruled by his passions, for good and ill, he will forever draw 
resentment from those who believe he squandered his chance to leave a larger 
imprint on society. 
</P>
<P>
This image of liberal impotence, however, can be misleading. For as the 1990s 
begin, Ted Kennedy sits in the catbird seat on Capitol Hill. He will not be 
President, and seems to know that. Instead, he has channeled his energy and 
ambition into the Senate, a small, clubby hive of barons that perfectly suits 
his talents. 
</P>
<P>
Now fifth in seniority in the upper chamber, he has built a kind of shadow 
government as chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and head of 
Judiciary and Armed Services subcommittees. Through serendipity and political 
acumen, he is positioned to dominate the domestic agenda for the rest of this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kennedy's political adversaries acknowledge that his fingerprints may be 
found on much of the significant social legislation of the past 
quarter-century: voting rights, immigration reform, occupational safety, fair 
housing, consumer protection, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100th Congress, he shoved 39 bills through his committee and into law, 
including a big AIDS package and restrictions on the use of lie detectors in 
the workplace. Of nine Democratic objectives in the Senate for this second 
session of the 101st Congress, five will be routed through Kennedy's Labor 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"He's becoming the statesman that we all hoped he would be," says Sen. Orrin 
Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on Labor. "Whether you agree with him or 
not, he's become one of the all-time great senators." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as ever, he remains a figure of controversy and complexity -- diligent, 
shrewd, loud, funny, indiscreet, generous, bibulous, moody, tenacious. An 
extroverted raconteur with a million friends, he can be his own worst enemy. 
His vices are well-catalogued, most recently in a Gentlemen's Quarterly article 
that portrayed him as an alcoholic libertine "who grew to manhood without 
learning to be an adult." 
</P>
<P>
Steadfastly consistent in his political catechism, he is nevertheless a study 
in paradox: a peerless orator afflicted with bouts of baffling incoherence and 
blurry political vision; a droll, self-deprecating wit who can be foul-tempered 
and impatient; a champion of righteous causes whose personal morals are 
perpetually under fire; a compassionate advocate for the better angels of our 
nature, capable, in the phrase of one admiring former aide, of "calculated 
demagoguery"; an implacable foe of Reaganism and Reaganomics who openly admires 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
He embodies a peculiarly American archetype -- the Good Bad Boy -- who 
perseveres, with charm, despite life's vicissitudes and his own defects. Driven 
by dreams of a better future, he refers frequently to the past and his fallen 
brothers -- often to good political effect, but without seeming manipulative, 
perhaps because so much of his personal memory is our public memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think," says former Kennedy press secretary Bob Shrum, "that the 
country has a very complicated set of feelings about him and his family?" 
</P>
<P>
The most public of politicians, Ted Kennedy is also one of the most difficult 
to know. Several months of Kennedy-watching leave a curious thatchwork of 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to dominating any room he enters, he can be overbearing and caustic 
-- "that snitty tone," one acquaintance calls it -- if the limelight focuses 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Intensely competitive, he loves to wager, not as a compulsive gambler but 
rather as someone who enjoys being right. 
</P>
<P>
He is neither erudite nor particularly analytical, except when it comes to 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
He also is impulsive: During a trip to Sparta, Ga., in December, he abruptly 
deviated from the schedule to tromp through a marshy field and inspect the wood 
filigree on an old barn that was for sale. "It's only $7,500," he muttered 
aloud, "but where would I put it?" 
</P>
<P>
In late February, during a dinner in Washington for Vaclav Havel, Kennedy 
decided the new Czech president must visit the Lincoln Memorial -- and off they 
went, late at night. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to find Ted Kennedy," says Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), 
echoing a similar line about Franklin D. Roosevelt, "listen for the laughter." 
</P>
<P>
Robust humor is both salient in Kennedy's character and a secret to his 
political success. He is a gifted mimic, whether imitating Italian ward heelers 
in New England or his grandfather's singsong Boston brogue. He often lampoons 
himself, particularly his girth. 
</P>
<P>
His puckish streak plays well on the Hill, where humor can heal even the most 
jagged political wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Kennedy and Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) fell into a heated 
Labor Committee argument over additional federal aid to education. After 
several barbed exchanges, Kennedy cut off the discussion and gaveled the 
session to a close. But as the two senators left the room for a meeting of the 
Judiciary Committee, Kennedy threw an arm around his colleague's shoulder. 
"C'mon, Strom," he urged, "let's go upstairs and I'll give you a few judges." 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of good humor is bad humor, particularly if Kennedy's patience is 
taxed. 
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, Switzerland, several years ago, he threw a bitter tantrum when a 
snafu caused a girlfriend to show up at the wrong airport terminal. Last 
November, as Congress careened toward a recess, he apologized for his office 
petulance by sending flowers to his secretaries -- with a note signed, "From 
Grumpy." 
</P>
<P>
Even the ritualized courtesies of the Senate melt away when he blows a fuse. 
Kennedy erupted during a small, private meeting about a drug bill in the vice 
president's office in the Capitol. When Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) persistently 
questioned a Kennedy amendment regarding the death penalty -- a provision that 
Senate leaders already had agreed could come to a floor vote -- Kennedy 
exploded: "I even opposed the death penalty for the man who killed my brother!" 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Kennedy has found it easier to make public reference to the 
tragedies that stain his life. But sometimes the scar tissue rips away. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1983, the night before a memorial Mass at Holy Trinity Church in 
Georgetown marking the 20th anniversary of John Kennedy's assassination, he 
stopped abruptly while rehearsing his remarks and stalked in sorrow and anger 
down the aisle and out of the church. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, at a House luncheon celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Peace 
Corps, Kennedy again faltered during his speech. Waving a hand in front of his 
face as though trying to claw away the pain, he turned, left the podium and 
walked back to his Senate office alone, several staff members trailing at a 
respectful distance. 
</P>
<P>
The overriding impression Kennedy leaves is of a man consigned to perpetual 
motion. Involuntary idleness -- waiting for a late plane, getting stuck in 
traffic -- often makes him furious. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a shark -- not in the negative sense, but rather in the fact that 
he's got to keep moving all the time. That's part of Ted Kennedy's metabolism," 
says Thomas M. Susman, who spent 11 years on the Judiciary staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is he so driven?" another former Judiciary staffer asks. "Because when 
you've got a legacy like his, you're one step ahead of the shadows. He's 
competing with myths." Less generous and more prosaic is the explanation of 
another aide who sees occasional glimpses of "a spoiled rich kid . . . who's 
never had to wait in line for anything." 
</P>
<P>
He ardently believes in the urgency of his causes, in pushing for a society 
that is fair, just, humane. As the sole male survivor in a family obsessed with 
public achievement, he is constantly confronted with the unfinished agenda -- 
and legendary stature -- of his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
And were he to stop "moving all the time," in Susman's phrase, who would Ted 
Kennedy be? Perhaps just another rich playboy, a clutch of appetites and 
indulgences, a nobody. As one of his closest friends observes, "This is a man 
who's not asking many questions about life; he's just doing it." 
</P>
<P>
"My babies," Rose Kennedy once said, "were rocked to political lullabies." 
Clearly, Ted Kennedy remembers the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
When referring to himself professionally, he almost invariably uses the word 
"politician, and on political terrain he is as sure-footed as anyone on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In the cloakroom or on the floor, Kennedy shuttles between senators, wheedling, 
guffawing, importuning and periodically peeking at a note card of colleagues to 
lobby and subjects to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Jack considered his youngest sibling the best politician in the family, 
and that may be most evident in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy brand of politics requires a big, sometimes brassy supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
"Kennedy uses staff people the way Pony Express riders used horses: Ride 'em 
hard and then leap to another horse," says Thomas M. Rollins, former staff 
director of the Labor Committee. "He's a genius at managing people." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's presidential ambitions once attracted bright young Democrats who 
envisioned themselves with big offices in the White House West Wing. Today the 
rewards must be found in working for a senator able to get things done. 
</P>
<P>
His staff is one of the Senate's largest, with nearly 100 professionals and 
several dozen interns and visiting fellows. Universally acclaimed for its 
competence, the staff is often suspected of being the driving force behind the 
senator's success. In truth, the relationship is symbiotic, an intimate bond of 
mutual benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's nocturnal ramblings and other personal habits have been the subject 
of uncommon public interest since a young woman died in his car beneath the 
bridge at Chappaquiddick more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tales of his drinking and raffish behavior have become part of his public 
persona, often lumped under a vaster damnation known as "the character issue." 
</P>
<P>
He appears to compartmentalize his off-duty conduct and his Senate 
responsibilities. During dozens of interviews for this article, with friends 
and foes, not one could cite an instance in which drinking appeared to impair 
him professionally. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kennedy also has a knack for embarrassing himself in public. He was: caught 
in flagrante delicto with a female luncheon companion on the floor of La 
Brasserie restaurant in 1987; photographed last summer atop a comely brunette 
on a boat in St. Tropez; observed with Dodd in 1985 as they smashed each 
other's autographed pictures in La Colline restaurant on Capitol Hill; involved 
in a barroom scuffle last winter at 2 a.m. with a heckler in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Such episodes provide ample ammunition for the senator's political antagonists. 
"He has been utterly shameless, brazen and indifferent to what should be his 
internal conscience," says Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative 
Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, Kennedy likes to drink. During a two-hour stretch on a 
Lufthansa flight from Boston to West Germany in November, he downed two 
Scotches, two vodkas, and, with dinner, three glasses of red wine. After three 
hours of sleep, he appeared sharp and refreshed upon arriving in Frankfurt, 
where he put in a full day. He also is disciplined enough to stop drinking 
during his annual winter diet. Last year, for example, he lost 50 pounds in 49 
days, imbibing little more than a weight-loss concoction. 
</P>
<P>
But the wine-and-women lifestyle leaves him vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy. 
When the nomination of John Tower as Defense secretary turned into a referendum 
on extracurricular behavior, no senator kept his head lower than Kennedy -- to 
the point that it became a joke on the Senate floor and in the press gallery. 
(Kennedy eventually voted against Tower's nomination.) 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy is not enlightening when discussing morality and his private behavior. 
He professes to ignore accounts of his drinking and womanizing. His colleagues, 
he says, will judge him on the basis of the man they know rather than the man 
they read about. 
</P>
<P>
Among human virtues, Kennedy rates loyalty very high. For nearly 30 years, he 
has been a faithful standard-bearer for the very young and very old, for 
immigrants and refugees, for blacks and American Indians and blue-collar 
workers. For the most part, these constituencies have repaid the allegiance. An 
Ebony poll in 1988 found that the magazine's black readers trusted Kennedy more 
than any other white American. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy sees himself now as more tolerant, patient, pragmatic -- "finally 
hitting my stride." In recent years, he has elevated his native gift for 
getting along with older men into a potent knack for coalition building. 
</P>
<P>
He and Hatch, hardly organized labor's best friend, joined forces to overcome 
White House opposition in 1988 and pass into law a bill that prohibits most 
employers from using polygraph tests on workers or job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Kennedy spent hours meeting with White House Chief of Staff John 
Sununu, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and Senate Republicans to reach a compromise 
on the Americans With Disabilities Act, prohibiting discrimination against 43 
million Americans with physical or mental handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Kennedy's greatest asset in the Senate is persistence. In the late 
1970s, he labored to fashion an 880-page bill that restructured the U.S. 
criminal code, only to see the proposal die in the House. Six years later, he 
finally succeeded in finessing many of the provisions into law. 
</P>
<P>
But on other issues, the jury is still out. In the 1980s, Kennedy tried to 
modify the liberal agenda by shifting costs away from the federal Treasury to 
businesses. His most ambitious effort in this vein involves mandatory, 
employer-financed health insurance, a proposal that thus far -- to Kennedy's 
great frustration -- has failed to muster sufficient political support. 
</P>
<P>
Less clear is Kennedy's larger message about the nation's future. Kennedy 
speaks of "convincing the people that you want to be able to do more with 
less," of discovering "ways that we can still stay committed to these 
fundamental values, but do it in different ways." 
</P>
<P>
When asked how Democrats can "move beyond the New Deal, the New Frontier, and 
the Great Society," as he says they must, Kennedy replies, "We ought to be in a 
more important and dramatic way focusing on the minimum standards of decency in 
terms of the quality of life for working men and women." 
</P>
<P>
That's the ideology Democrats are going to ride to the White House? he is 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy shrugs and replies, "There are some that would agree and some that 
would differ."

YOUTH BASKETBALL: RECRUITERS LURE PLAYERS AS YOUNG AS 10 WITH FREE HIGH-TECH 
SNEAKERS, FREE TRAVEL AND SOMETIMES EVEN CASH. 
</P>

<P>
At Victoria Park in Carson, someone has an eye on the action. Same for the 
Queen Anne and Denker recreation centers in Los Angeles, as well as playgrounds 
and gyms near you. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever the cadence of bouncing basketballs can be heard, someone will be 
watching. Children as young as 10 and 11 know it. The adults influencing them 
-- parents, coaches and scouts -- also know. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is looking for the heir to Jordan's throne. 
</P>
<P>
This new star may not rise out of the streets of Los Angeles. So the eye also 
is cast on other basketball hot spots -- New York, Chicago, Washington, 
Detroit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But rise he will, and most likely he will graduate from what has become a flesh 
market -- an off-Wall Street carnival of bartering and brokering. Instead of 
stocks and bonds, the player dealers push bodies. The biggest and best are 
delivered to high schools, youth traveling all-star teams and colleges for a 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the fair market value to get a player is a pair of high-tech 
basketball sneakers. Other times it is meal money or a trip to a summer 
all-star tournament, hotel and transportation included. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
"(Young players) see the older guys at the colleges with the perks," said Benny 
Davenport, coach of the L.A. Westside Blazers youth team since 1967. "They 
think it is their God-given right that they get these kinds of things, too." 
</P>
<P>
It may not be their right, but it is part of today's game of moving basketball 
players through the system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Roundball Roundup 
</P>
<P>
Whether people want to believe it or not, kids who play on all-star traveling 
teams are getting paid. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Josh Oppenheimer, Northern Arizona guard from Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High 
School 
</P>
<P>
One summer day a fews years ago, Chris Mills was playing pickup basketball with 
members of the L.A. Rockfish, a traveling all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockfish boasted 11 future Division I scholarship players. Mills -- a 
member of the American Roundball Corp. (ARC) summer team -- was on his way to 
becoming one of the country's top five recruits. Some of Los Angeles' best 
talent was lighting up the gymnasium in Hollywood that afternoon, recalled 
David Benezra, Rockfish coach. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a representative from Mills' youth all-star team appeared with a car 
full of sporting goods -- a sort of Foot Locker on wheels. He feared that Mills 
might consider defecting to another program and wanted to ensure that would not 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
Mills was offered the store. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Benezra said, a rival coach arrived with a trunkload of enticements and a 
similar offer. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how they knew where to find Mills. But certainly this future 
All-American from Fairfax High School was the prize in a bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
Benezra could do nothing but watch, mouth agape. He said it was difficult to 
believe the methods the youth coaches used to court Mills, who said recently he 
does not recall ever playing pickup basketball with the Rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to players with extraordinary talent, coaches apparently will 
do plenty. A few years later, Mills was the center of a college recruiting 
scandal that rocked the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Mills' father, Claud, allegedly was sent $1,000 in a package with game film by 
a Wildcat assistant coach. That disclosure was the catalyst for an NCAA 
investigation that resulted in Kentucky's probation. Mills transferred to the 
University of Arizona where he will be eligible to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Los Angeles players, coaches and officials say that situations such 
as Mills' illustrates the corruption of Southern California youth basketball. 
</P>
<P>
They say the Southland is rife with recruiting wars that begin with 
shoe-company sponsored leagues and teams. The recruiters are suspected of being 
equipped with top-of-the line sneakers, other sporting goods equipment and cash 
to entice players, an allegation shoe company officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
On one side is the American Roundball Corp. league of the San Fernando Valley. 
It is sponsored by Nike, manufacturer of the popular Air Jordan basketball 
shoe. 
</P>
<P>
ARC also sponsors elite traveling all-star teams that play in national 
tournaments in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side is the Slam-n-Jam league of Carson. It is sponsored by 
Reebok, manufacturer of the popular Pump basketball shoe. 
</P>
<P>
Slam-n-Jam also sponsors elite traveling teams. 
</P>
<P>
In between are smaller organizations that play in the two leagues -- the 
Westside Blazers, KNE Spurs, B&amp;B Bulls, Orange County Crush, South Coast 
All-Stars and Orange County Express. These are mostly neighborhood programs 
with little or no corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
All, however, want L.A.'s best players, and in some respect all recruit them. 
</P>
<P>
The players and parents contend that basketball keeps youths off city streets, 
away from gangs and drugs. Why shouldn't they use their talents to get ahead? 
</P>
<P>
So, the youths learn to expect free trips to summer tournaments around the 
country, shoes, sweats, uniforms, meals and, in some cases, money. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this is done in violation of high school and collegiate sports rules, 
according to officials. Representatives of governing bodies such as the 
California Interscholastic Federation and the NCAA acknowledge the problem but 
say it is difficult to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a friend who was thinking about a high school," said Randy Horn, a guard 
at L.A. Cathedral High School. "The coach was talking to him a lot, picking him 
up and taking him out to dinner. My friend was more excited about going out 
than worrying about whether it was right or wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robert J. Minnix, a director of enforcement for the NCAA: "You and I can 
talk about morality and ethics. But don't tell some kid from the streets about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
And on the streets of Los Angeles, the flesh market is thriving. The peddlers 
-- known as body snatchers, bag men, barracuda parents -- are plying their 
trade at the gyms and playgrounds, each looking for the next great prospect. 
Oppenheimer, who grew up with L.A. youth league basketball, said the city's 
best players are recruited three times. First, he said, youth league coaches 
battle for junior players. Then, high school coaches enter the ring, and 
finally the colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Said Trevor Wilson, a graduating UCLA forward who developed through ARC: 
"What's scary is, you see a lot of sixth-graders who have talent, and they will 
have a lot of guys gnawing at them. I don't think kids (that age) are mature 
enough to handle that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down in the Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we just get used. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Randy Horn, a junior guard at L.A. Cathedral High School 
</P>
<P>
In a few years, many of the players on the Mid Valley I eighth-grade all-star 
team will be coveted by college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Names to remember: Cameron Murray, brother of UCLA's outstanding freshman, 
Tracy; Damon Ollie, brother of North Hollywood senior standout Dana Jones; 
Terryl Woolery, brother of Fairfax star, John; Lorenzo LeuLaui, a 6-foot-2, 
180-pound power forward, and Alex Lopez, a 6-10 center. 
</P>
<P>
This 14-and-under team successfully competes against many high school varsity 
teams, say local scouts. 
</P>
<P>
They are the showcase team of Rich Goldberg, director and founder of ARC. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, a junior high school teacher and owner of a Burbank sporting goods 
store, is the architect of a basketball empire. He is credited with turning out 
some of L.A.'s biggest names -- Mills, Wilson, Higgins and Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
How he persuades such talent to join his league is subject to debate. 
Supporters say he is the reason so many L.A. players are recruited by Division 
I colleges. Critics claim he has taken recruiting to new depths. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it the decline of basketball in Southern California and I trace it to 
Goldberg," said one coach who asked not to be identified. "He was the one who 
started paying the players, letting them do all sorts of outrageous things." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the usual perks such as shoes, gym bags and uniforms, charges have been 
leveled that Goldberg buys players outright. Recent allegations surround 
eighth-graders Ollie and LeuLaui. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie was a member of the KNE Spurs that play at Dorsey High School before 
defecting to ARC's all-star junior high team last summer. LeuLaui, who lives in 
Santa Ana, was with the Orange County Express before leaving 1 1/2 years ago. 
Each player left his neighborhood program for a team that plays and practices 
in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches from both neighborhood teams say they lost their stars because Goldberg 
paid the parents. Ollie's mother, Spurs' coaches charge, was paid $10,000. The 
LeuLauis were given $15,000, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
The disgruntled coaches were unable to document their accusations, but insist 
that the circumstances were unsavory at best. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Ancar, Ollie's mother, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"If they didn't have that to say, they would have something else to say," she 
said. "The free shoes, trips and all that didn't have anything to do with Damon 
switching teams. Anyone who says that Rich Goldberg bought Damon Ollie, I don't 
care what they say. They ought to quit being so jealous. 
</P>
<P>
"If something like that is offered to you -- a chance to go on trips and play 
for a more competitive team -- then why not take it? Everybody doesn't live in 
the Valley and make $100,000 a year. With ARC, it's more exposure for Damon." 
</P>
<P>
Said Woolery's mother, Tamara: "If you go to see how Damon is living, you'll 
know Gail was not given a lot of money. She is not that type of person to sell 
her kid." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morrison, coach of the Spurs, said he tried to arrange for Ollie and 
Woolery to play for both teams. Morrison said Goldberg agreed, but later 
persuaded the families to have the boys play solely for ARC. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg offered another version. He said that Ollie, Woolery and some other 
Spurs were asked to choose which would be their main team, Mid Valley or the 
Spurs, when the teams entered the same Thanksgiving tournament. Ollie and 
Woolery selected Mid Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day (Morrison) calls Damon and Terryl and throws them off the team," 
Goldberg said. "It was a straight out-and-out lie because he said they could 
play on both teams without repercussions. Then he went around accusing me of 
inducing the kids to play, which is ridiculous. I never had a problem with the 
kids playing on both teams." 
</P>
<P>
Woolery's mother said: "Rich is helping the kids who aren't the superstars. So 
I can't fault him for helping the superstars, too. I do think he has a genuine 
concern for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo LeuLaui's situation is similar to Ollie's. LeuLaui was playing with the 
Express, which gained some measure of recognition with Bob Gottlieb, a college 
coach for six seasons at the University of Jacksonville and Wisconsin 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of LeuLaui in 1988, the Express improved dramatically. That 
did not go unnoticed by Goldberg. LeuLaui and Gottlieb's son, Doug, were 
allowed to play on Mid Valley's all-star team in an AAU tournament in Seattle 
at Bob Gottlieb's request. 
</P>
<P>
After the tournament, LeuLaui decided to switch to Mid Valley, said Lorenzo's 
father, David. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, "Raw Recruits," by Alexander Wolff and Armen Keteyian, Gottlieb 
said he was told "that Rich Goldberg had come by (LeuLaui's) house that fall. 
Goldberg told him how much he liked Lorenzo and the family, how he knew they 
were poor. He wanted to help them put a down payment on a new house, help them 
buy a new car. He offered David $15,000." 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb said in the book that David LeuLaui later told him he had received 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd asked the father whether he thought he'd have been offered that money if 
his son wasn't a basketball player," Gottlieb said. "And he said, 'Yes. It's a 
miracle. Goldberg giving us this has nothing to do with my son being a player. 
It's because he wants to help me, because I'm a poor man. What's wrong with 
that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb said in an interview that he was so upset that he tried to recruit 
some of Goldberg's best players. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't offer them anything except a chance to get good coaching," he said. 
"None of them were interested. I was so angry about what happened with Lorenzo. 
Goldberg was supposed to be a friend." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has not talked to Goldberg in 18 months, although his team plays in 
one of ARC's youth leagues. 
</P>
<P>
David LeuLaui, a machinist, said Gottlieb's account is a fabrication. He said 
Goldberg never gave him money. He said Gottlieb confused the fact that LeuLaui 
bought a used van with money from a savings account. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought that money came from Nike," LeuLaui said. "I told him where it came 
from. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the father of six children. I wish Rich Goldberg gave me $15,000. But it 
is ridiculous to think he would give money for a seventh-grader. If he gave me 
the money, I would tell you. I have nothing to hide." 
</P>
<P>
LeuLaui said Goldberg does help defray the cost of trips Lorenzo takes with the 
team. Goldberg makes sure Lorenzo has transportation from Santa Ana to North 
Hollywood for games and practices and pays for out-of-state trips, such as one 
over spring break to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"He paid for the trips to Seattle and back East," LeuLaui said. "I gave my son 
$100 to give to him to help him because Rich is not a rich man." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, who spends three nights a week plus weekends making sure his leagues 
around the Southland run smoothly, also denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me wonder why I'm doing (this)," he said. "I'm not looking for a 
college job, and I'm not even looking for a high school job anymore. We do it 
for the kids. Some of these others do it for their own self-interest, and 
that's the big difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Gottlieb is frustrated. He's an ex-college coach who can't get a job. He is in 
it totally for himself and his son. He's not in it for the kids, and the kids 
know it. It's just total jealousy. There is no way I would have ever done that 
(pay the LeuLauis)." 
</P>
<P>
Although those involved categorically deny payoffs, no one questions Goldberg's 
influence in helping eighth-graders pick their high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Youth league directors often align with certain high school coaches because 
they have access to school gymnasiums and players for summer all-star teams. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement also serves high school coaches. They have a breeding ground 
for talent, starting with boys as young as 8. It is not beyond a youth league 
director to deliver a player to a high school if the prep coach cooperates by 
sending players to the director's league. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie, LeuLaui and Woolery are considering tiny Campbell Hall High School in 
North Hollywood, where ARC plays some games and practices. The 6-10 Lopez last 
week announced he would attend the school. Their presence would make Campbell 
Hall, a Southern Section 1-A school, an instant basketball power. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell Hall's coach, Joe Jackson, attended a tournament last February in his 
gym in which the eighth-graders were participating. 
</P>
<P>
His presence might be considered a violation of the Southern Section's rule 
against undue influence, said Dean Crowley, Southern Section associate 
commissioner of athletics. High school coaches are not allowed to contact 
prospective players, although it happens more than the high school governing 
body cares to admit. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley sent each Southern Section principal a memo three years ago, advising 
them of potential problems when ARC teams use school's gyms. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in a lot of cases the principals don't even know the gyms are being 
used," Crowley said. "And the coaches don't know what the rules are." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Campbell Hall, Goldberg has leagues at Artesia, La Puente Nogales and 
Santa Ana Century high schools. Crowley said Goldberg now contacts his office 
in an attempt to comply with regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Since the players in question have opportunities to play for some of the city's 
more prestigious programs, many wonder why the stars of Mid Valley would 
consider Campbell Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Picking a high school can be as hard as picking a college," said Ancar, whose 
eldest son, Dana, has accepted a scholarship to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen basketball-wise. I wanted Damon to have the academics 
first." 
</P>
<P>
David LeuLaui said Goldberg wanted the eighth-grade team to stay together 
through high school. The only way he could do that without moving every player 
into a certain district was to place them in a private school that is not 
confined to enrollment boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
But LeuLaui told his son, who is a straight-A student, North Hollywood was too 
far a commute. 
</P>
<P>
So, LeuLaui is considering all the Santa Ana schools, such as Mater Dei, 
Saddleback, Santa Ana Valley and Century. He said Lorenzo is leaning toward 
Century, where he plays in one of ARC's spring leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said he also was contacted by Coach Leo Klemm, who is thought to 
aggressively recruit junior high school players to Santa Monica St. Monica High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The Campbell Hall case is not the first instance in which Goldberg has 
attempted to place players. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982-83, Goldberg was a walk-on coach at Calabasas High. When he arrived 
with Trevor Wilson, the principal was upset, said John Reich, the school's 
present athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson had been coached by Goldberg since he was 13. Although Wilson lived 
across the valley in Sherman Oaks, he was supposed to move in with a family in 
exclusive Hidden Hills, within Calabasas' district, Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson was forced to leave after a few days on campus, Reich said. Goldberg 
left after the season when the school hired a full-time teacher to coach. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson eventually played for Reseda Cleveland after bypassing Van Nuys, where 
his brother, Hunter Greene, was a star. 
</P>
<P>
"When Trevor was coming up, there were a tremendous amount of (high) schools 
trying to recruit him," said Greene, formerly a standout for the University of 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said that Wilson asked to attend Calabasas because his junior high did 
not have a competitive team. He said Wilson, a sister and his mother, 
Antoinette, moved into a wing of a home in Hidden Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole family moved there," Goldberg said. "This was for academics as much 
as basketball. I'll admit it probably was a mistake. But Trevor decided to 
leave on his own because he was so far behind in school." 
</P>
<P>
Said Greene, who maintains that Goldberg was a major influence in helping 
Wilson become a college basketball player: "My mom, my two sisters and I never 
left Sherman Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg's partnership with Joe Dunn, coach at Burbank Bellarmine Jefferson 
High School, also has been questioned. They are co-owners of a sporting goods 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg advises some ARC players to attend Bell-Jeff because, "(Dunn is) the 
best coach in the Valley," said Alex Lopez's mother, Deborah. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said that he and Dunn did not direct players to Bell-Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's true, then why aren't all the Mid Valley kids going there?" Goldberg 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
American Roundball Corp. leagues are conducted in 32 cites around the country, 
from Bloomington, Ind., to Seattle. The flagship operation is in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Goldberg's operation might be crumbling. Sonny Vaccaro, who does 
promotional work for Nike, said he will reevaluate the shoe company's 
sponsorship of ARC this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm embarrassed," Vaccaro said of the situation in Los Angeles. "I hope we can 
settle it down and do the right thing. I nor Nike will allow anything to go on 
underhanded." 
</P>
<P>
Vaccaro said he does not know specific instances of player payment, but "a 
value system must be set up. It can't be the most important thing in the world 
to be on a team that has the best team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that important to me if Rich wins a summer league title or if Reebok 
wins one. What's important to me is having a thousand kids in the program." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Jones, director of Nike's basketball promotions, said the company spends 
about $150,000 annually on ARC in equipment, scorekeepers, game officials, 
T-shirts and uniforms. Jones said the total reflects 32 ARC leagues nationwide, 
not just Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said it is a misconception that Nike or Goldberg give away shoes to the 
5,000 to 7,000 young players who participate nationwide. He said Nike does give 
shoes to traveling summer teams that play in all-star tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite what has been said, Rich Goldberg has a good reputation in the L.A. 
area," Jones said. "He has exposed a lot of kids to basketball. He has provided 
that opportunity through a lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Slam-n-Jam league, Reebok sponsors the state high school basketball 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you pull out all sponsorships?" Vaccaro asked. "What are you going to do? 
The shoe companies are not going to go out of business if we stop sponsoring 
summer league teams. We're giving something back. That's what we were trying to 
do. It's a give-back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Vaccaro's stance, some L.A. coaches blame shoe companies for escalating 
the recruiting wars. 
</P>
<P>
"The system doesn't want to hear about saving any kids from the inner city," 
the Blazers' Davenport said. "It wants to put the shoes on the next Michael 
Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
Vaccaro, who started the Dapper Dan all-star game in Pittsburgh 26 years ago, 
said he accepts responsibility for allowing ARC to operate unchecked. He said 
the problem started when basketball left the neighborhoods and went national in 
the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's Minnix agreed. He said competition with all-star games, all-star 
camps, AAU, National Junior Basketball, Basketball Congress International and 
other leagues has changed the game's fabric. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up in the City 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing wrong with California youth basketball. Just because there are 
a few bad people out there doesn't mean the rest of us are doing anything 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Issy Washington, director of the Slam-n-Jam youth league 
</P>
<P>
Issy Washington, 50, says he has not missed a basketball season as a player or 
coach in more than 40 years. He started the Slam-n-Jam league more than 11 
years ago and, until Goldberg started the ARC, had the only game in town that 
mattered. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has fewer detractors than Goldberg, but his critics say this former 
Air Force major has catered to young superstars by giving them Reebok shoes and 
accessories to keep them in his league. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys like Issy Washington are awfully, awfully powerful," Minnix said. 
"If you don't cater to them, they won't bring their kids to the tournaments. 
They demand a few goodies a coach with a few more morals might not ask for. The 
shoe companies pay homage to these guys more than the high school coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Washington dismisses the criticism by denying that he recruits players. He also 
denies giving players special treatment with shoes or accessories. He said 
Reebok gives him 50 pairs of shoes to give to underprivileged youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Washington also said he buys Reeboks at cost, from $25 to $30, to distribute to 
Slam-n-Jam players. 
</P>
<P>
He said Reebok gives him $20,000 to run his league and $20,000 to run a 
national tournament. He also receives about $40,000 in equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Washington charges an entry fee of $125 a player. Participants get shoes, 
T-shirts and organized games for their money. ARC's entry fee is $65. 
</P>
<P>
Some players, often the stars who come from poor families, are given discounts 
to play in the leagues. Washington and Goldberg say they do this out of 
charity, but it is the majority, paying full freight, who apparently make up 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Washington said his approach to youth basketball is different from Goldberg's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to win a national championship like he is," Washington said. 
"I've never won one. I don't control anybody except the guys out of Victoria 
Park. I've never sat in on a home visit with a college coach, and I don't steer 
kids to high schools. But you just can't control all the coaches in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Washington cites efforts in tutoring inner-city youths in taking college 
entrance exams as an example of how Slam-n-Jam helps the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm down here where the real wars are happening," Washington said. "What we're 
trying to do is give some of our kids the same opportunities as rich, white 
kids. A loss of a $72,000 scholarship is a loss to the black community." 
</P>
<P>
He said Slam-n-Jam is so popular that 800 players applied for 600 slots this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Players from most teams must try out. Those turned away often play in the less 
competitive National Junior Basketball league, which revolves around high 
schools, not regions. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, also chairman of boys basketball for the Southern Pacific Assn. of 
the AAU, said he does not need to recruit because high school coaches send 
players to him. 
</P>
<P>
"You're making a big deal out of nothing," Washington said. "To say I, Reebok 
or Nike control all the kids . . . none of the kids are getting involved with 
this free stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep hearing I am having a feud with Rich Goldberg. Well, I'm not. And I 
don't care about losing top players to Rich. We're still going to beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Slam-n-Jam has about 50 teams with 10 to 12 players a team playing in three 
locations during the spring. Washington no longer offers summer leagues because 
he said he did not want to interfere with high school summer programs. But Team 
Reebok is well represented in all-star summer tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Barrett, who coaches an outstanding Orange County-based sixth-grade team 
that competes in Slam-n-Jam, said of the 600 participants, as many as 75 
eventually will play NCAA Division I basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of that possibility, college recruiters become the sycophants of youth 
league organizers such as Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Age-Old Game 
</P>
<P>
If I wanted to go out and recruit for my team, I could go to L.A. and give a 
kid a pair of shoes and sweats and their parents some gas money to take them 
around and they would be with you at all the tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat Barrett, formerly an assistant coach at Santa Ana Mater Dei High School 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. flesh market has been operating for years, although probably not to 
the degree that it is today. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of youth ball coaches were connected to high school coaches (years ago) 
but people didn't know it," said David Benezra, who started coaching at the 
Beverly Hills YMCA when he was 14. 
</P>
<P>
"Plenty of coaching friends of mine in the South-Central area were driving 
around, getting shoes from coaches to give to the players on their team and 
influencing them to go to certain high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one guy who would drive from park to park in the off-season. He 
picked up the kids and said, 'I'll take you to McDonald's, give you a free 
T-shirt and I want you to play for my team.' His roster changed from week to 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Benezra said that former Pepperdine star Dwayne Polee, as a youngster, played 
for seven youth teams in the span of a month during one season. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no rules regarding switching teams," Benezra said. "It was whoever 
had the best deal going that week." 
</P>
<P>
Many youth coaches are considered basketball junkies who simply love the game. 
They feel important when watching a youngster they coached play in the Final 
Four or NBA. They can tell friends that they made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
But others see the young players as opportunities to gain recognition in the 
basketball world. They believe that attaching themselves to a superstar can 
lead to an NCAA Division I coaching position, employment with a high-powered 
booster, or perhaps, at least, a pair of season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Once a player and his parents trust this person, he can control the college 
recruiting process. When Benezra coached the Rockfish, he was criticized for 
wielding too much control. 
</P>
<P>
But Benezra, who last season coached at Northern Arizona, said he worked with 
the parents to educate them on how to best select a school. He said he never 
dealt players. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in a position where I could have lied and told some big Division I 
school that I can deliver a player," Benezra said. "They'll go for it. There 
are some desperate programs out there. They are desperate to find somebody who 
is a pipeline to the best kids." 
</P>
<P>
That is the essence of flesh peddling. The talent broker serves as a middleman 
between college or high school recruiter and family. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, who started coaching youth teams in Orange County in the early '80s, 
has been accused of peddling Tom Lewis to colleges in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Barrett said the criticism has left him drained. 
</P>
<P>
He said some adult had to help Lewis when he was a senior at Mater Dei High 
School. Lewis was living with the Barrett family because of problems at home. 
Barrett was Mater Dei's assistant coach. The circumstance seemed suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"(Brokers) are looked at as either trying to help the kid or wanting something 
in return," said Barrett, who, either as a youth league or specialist coach has 
worked with Higgins, Mills and Ed O'Bannon, among other players, and has 
refused to help in their recruiting. "I was put in that either-or category with 
Tom. I never did anything wrong with Tom. I'll never be in that position 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis decided to attend USC, but later transferred to Pepperdine when Trojan 
Coach Stan Morrison was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Curry, coach at Los Angeles Harbor College, used to have a lot of clout as 
a coach of the L.A. Magicians, one of the first city all-star teams. Curry 
coached such players as John Williams, Maurice Williams and David Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
If a recruiter wanted to talk to a Magician he would first contact one of the 
coaches -- Curry, Joe Clark or Joe Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost became quasi-agents," Curry said. "It got to the point where it 
wasn't just with high school coaches. We might have had too much of an 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal opinion is that all-star teams and traveling teams have too much 
of influence on a child's recruitment, compared to high school coaches." 
</P>
<P>
High school coaches voice other complaints. They say the value of team play is 
lost in spring and summer leagues, where the emphasis is on playground moves 
and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"In the spring, a lot of coaches just let their guys run up and down the floor 
and there is no benefit to kids," Mater Dei's Gary McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight started coaching in youth basketball but has developed California's 
premier high school program. His Monarchs won the Division I State championship 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
"These coaches are almost like pimps," he said. "It's just an ego thing for 
them to be attached to the best kids." 
</P>
<P>
Yet his players and most high school stars compete in Slam-n-Jam or ARC, for 
the simple reason that athletes who want to be recruited must participate. 
</P>
<P>
"There are (few) college coaches who go and scout high school games anymore," 
said Coach Mike Miller, who led Ribet Academy of La Canada Flintridge to the 
Southern Section 1-A title this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The players have to participate in the leagues now, otherwise they're passed 
by. There is a limited number of scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"Players are being led to the slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
Those who survive hope to find their names on the next pair of big-selling 
sneakers. Those who fail are seldom heard from again.

POVERTY FIGHTER LOST BATTLE WITH HIMSELF; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITY: LONGTIME CRUSADER SCOTT MATHER GAVE SO MUCH OF HIMSELF FIGHTING FOR 
CAUSES THAT HIS OWN FAMILY SUFFERED FOR IT. GRADUALLY, HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING 
FROM THE POOR INSTEAD. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Scott Mather sank into a chair across from six of his closest associates 
one cloudy afternoon in mid-March, he had a good idea of what was about to 
unfold. 
</P>
<P>
The group, all of them leaders in the California Homeless Coalition that Mather 
chaired, had gathered in the fifth-floor conference room of the United 
Methodist Church building in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The first to speak was the Rev. Gene Boutilier, who had come to admire and 
respect Mather for his skills in articulating the needs of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reason to believe that your insurance business has been in disarray on 
at least a couple of occasions," Boutilier told Mather. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation that followed was painful for all of them, according to 
interviews with several participants. They told Mather they knew that he had 
taken insurance premiums from a charity that he helped establish, but they 
could find no evidence that an actual policy existed. It seemed he had lied to 
his customers, his friends. Was it true, they asked? 
</P>
<P>
Mather, by now in tears, abandoned the plan he had formulated on the drive up 
the Santa Ana Freeway from Orange County, of attempting to con his way out of 
any direct admission. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he answered. "I've been doing some things that I shouldn't have, and I'm 
going to have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
The unraveling of the web of deceit and secrecy he had maintained for five 
years had begun. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mather, 46, a former chairman of the Orange County Homeless Issues 
Task Force, is scheduled to meet with state insurance investigators. He said he 
will surrender his insurance broker's license. After that, he is not sure what 
awaits him. Possible criminal prosecution, maybe a jail term. 
</P>
<P>
His family is devastated. Both he and his wife, Kay, also an insurance agent 
who had managed her husband's independent business, said they are out of work. 
And the couple have taken out a second mortgage to repay the more than $27,000 
in premiums Mather has admitted taking. The family, including two teen-age 
children who still reside at home, is in counseling. Mather is reluctant to 
divulge details of the children's problems, he said. He is still working to 
accept his own responsibility for their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Their savings might hold out for 90 days; beyond that, all is a question mark, 
Mather said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no livelihood. I'm going to have to go out and create something," he 
said last week, sitting at the kitchen table of his comfortable, if cluttered, 
Costa Mesa home. 
</P>
<P>
He is a short, husky, bearded man with heavy-lidded eyes that, despite glasses, 
give an appearance of sadness. But his voice, even after weeks of stress, is 
lively. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I plan to stay here -- I'm not going to go and hide my head or 
shave my beard, but I don't know if I'm employable after something like this," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Scott Mather has the makings of a classic tale of a determined 
rise followed by a tragic downfall. Even colleagues who were victimized by 
Mather believe he was -- and still is -- genuinely devoted to helping the poor 
and needy. 
</P>
<P>
But they also believe he became hooked on the gratification and appreciation 
engendered by his efforts -- he became obsessed with public accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
His growing involvement with the homeless movement, which had prompted friends 
to marvel at his willingness to sacrifice his personal success, came with a 
heavy price, they now realize. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who kept welcoming his participation contributed to the fact that 
he didn't have the time to devote to his business," Boutilier, a minister with 
the United Church of Christ, said in a recent interview. "So he cut corners in 
his business rather than give up his community service. Once his business was 
in trouble, it was his problem and ours." 
</P>
<P>
After years of developing model shelters and poverty relief programs in Orange 
County, Mather emerged as a star in the statewide homeless movement. He was 
chairman of the California Homeless Coalition and was active with the 
California Right to Housing Campaign, which is pressing for passage of an 
initiative to provide money for low-income housing programs. In fact, Mather is 
the signer of the rebuttal argument that accompanies the Housing and Homeless 
Bond Act -- Proposition 107 -- on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
He acted as a guide and consultant when nationally known homeless advocate 
Mitch Snyder toured California last year. As the 1980s progressed, 
characterized nationally by affluence and indifference, he turned into a sort 
of "super-volunteer," according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
"We all sat and cheered him on, a little like cheering on a gladiator," said 
friend Allen Baldwin, executive director of the Orange County Community Housing 
Corp. "He filled a void that exists in almost every community in this country. 
Other areas have never had a Scott Mather, people who were in positions of such 
leadership on social issues." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mather acknowledges that he was driven by visions of a more equal 
distribution of society's favors, yet he proved capable by his actions of 
subverting that cause. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I recognized that I had gifts and talents that could be used to make a 
difference," said Mather, who attended college sporadically but never attained 
a degree. 
</P>
<P>
But he began to believe that the good cause justified expediency. "I was taking 
shortcuts, and that's not healthy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The public Mather is genial and knowledgeable. Closer scrutiny reveals 
shimmering contrasts: hard-working, articulate, generous, tenacious, impatient, 
compulsive, proud and racked with self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The nagging insecurity may relate to his upbringing. He was born in the Mesabi 
Range in northern Minnesota, hills veined with rich iron ore deposits, to a 
family of prosperous shopkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of World War II, his father, who had served in the Army, decided to 
move the family to the West Coast. They lived first in Roger Young Village, a 
huge encampment of Quonset huts built for returning veterans on the grounds of 
the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
The family then moved to Long Beach, to another housing project called Truman 
Boyd, near the oil fields on the west side of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mather said he does not remember his childhood years as being especially poor, 
but he concedes they were tough times. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a city park next to us, and I remember going to the lending library 
to get toys to play with," he recalled. "And I had to work to go to (a Catholic 
grammar) school." 
</P>
<P>
He worked in the cafeteria, doing dishes, mopping the floor. His father had 
opened a grill on Ocean Boulevard -- "It was before the fleet pulled out and it 
was pretty rowdy" -- and he worked there at nights. 
</P>
<P>
His family could not afford to send him away to college, so he became an 
ironworker. He plied his trade all over the country, but it was while building 
a power station in the Bunker Hill section of downtown Los Angeles in the mid 
1960s that the homeless problem first entered his consciousness in what must 
have been a searing image. 
</P>
<P>
"The sun would hit the hills and hundreds of people would emerge. They were 
living under bridges and trees, in the tunnels -- that really affected me and I 
never forgot it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But his active involvement was longer in coming, say friends. Jean Forbath, 
founder of the Orange County charity Share Our Selves and herself a prominent 
advocate for the needy, met Mather 15 years ago when both worked in religious 
education programs at the same church. 
</P>
<P>
She enlisted Mather's help in moving some donated furniture into an 
impoverished household and "he said it was too hard for him because it reminded 
him of his own childhood." 
</P>
<P>
Forbath said she was most impressed with Mather's intelligence -- he was a 
voracious reader hungry for knowledge. His lack of a formal education was a 
frustration to him, Mather conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time he wanted to enter a master's program in religious education, but 
he lacked a B.A.," Forbath recalled. "I wrote a letter of recommendation -- I 
thought he would have done wonderfully -- but he wasn't accepted." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid 1970s Mather had gone through a divorce and was physically drained 
from years of heavy labor. After meeting Kay, who was rooted in church and 
home, he discovered a stability he had never known. He decided to change his 
profession and entered the insurance business because he thought it was 
something he could do without a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
By then, having succeeded in establishing several church programs, he was 
deeply involved in poverty issues. He became chairman of the Orange Coast 
Interfaith Shelter; he was on the board of SOS; he helped develop the Orange 
County Homeless Issues Task Force; he was asked to travel and lecture on the 
art of preparing applications for federal and state grants; he helped to 
establish the California Homeless Coalition and HANDSNET, a statewide 
computerized charity information network. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Mather was devoting less and less attention to his business. He 
sold business, auto, liability and homeowners' insurance but primarily handled 
large manufacturing businesses and shopping centers. However, he pulled out of 
the commercial market about seven years ago, after losing a major shoe 
manufacturing account. 
</P>
<P>
When the national insurance market went soft soon after, his business took a 
nose-dive, he said. He began to concentrate instead on "mom-and-pop stuff" -- 
autos and homeowners -- and began doing business with several of the charities 
he was involved with. It was a mutually satisfactory arrangement, nearly 
everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
The family decided that he must maintain his commitment to his causes, that 
sacrificing a certain amount of income was an acceptable price to pay. 
</P>
<P>
But the damage was already done. He could see the effects of his almost 
fanatical activity in his teen-age children. They had begun to act out, 
sometimes aggressively, sometimes passively, Mather said. They became involved 
in drugs and alcohol. He would not talk in detail beyond saying, "There were 
hospitalizations." 
</P>
<P>
"I worked all day, then I was gone most nights with charity work," he said. 
"Even on the weekends when I was home, I was writing proposals for grants." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the chaos that had become his life, it was easy to rationalize using some 
of the money he received -- funds that were to be used for insurance premiums 
-- for his personal needs. He acted not out of greed but of expediency, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He does not remember -- or chooses not to relate -- the first instance in which 
he appropriated charity premiums for his own use. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, he said, he accepted premiums, thinking he could place them 
easily with insurance companies, but could not. He put things off, did not get 
back to them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to justify it," he said. "It's like a rolling thing. You put 
some back to take care of someone else. Then, I got so busy. Sometimes I think 
some of the activity was just so I wouldn't have to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
To date, five organizations in Orange and Los Angeles counties have indicated 
they paid premiums for bogus insurance policies. They include the Anaheim 
Interfaith Shelter, SOS, Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter in Costa Mesa, 
Friendship Shelter in Laguna Beach and Harbor Interfaith Shelter in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the Anaheim Interfaith Shelter discovered as early as last October 
that they did not have authentic policies. Several months later, directors of 
the San Pedro shelter, which Mather had helped to found, also discovered they 
had paid for polices that were never issued. Questions began to be raised among 
Mather's associates, which led to the Los Angeles meeting. Even after Mather's 
confession, his colleagues admitted they were reluctant to publicize his 
transgressions for fear the news might tarnish the image of their causes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, two of the shelters filed formal complaints with the state insurance 
commissioner, and members of the homeless coalition who had confronted Mather 
at the Los Angeles meeting issued an insurance fraud alert over HANDSNET, the 
computer network Mather had been instrumental in forming. 
</P>
<P>
Mather admitted there is still much denial to overcome. He did not tell Kay or 
the children about his improprieties for several days after the Los Angeles 
meeting. "I still thought maybe there was some way to pull it off quietly," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mather has retained an attorney but said he does not regret his confessions. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad and sorry about what I have done," he said. "But I'm trying to do 
my best to fix things. My big concern is that I have not done damage to the 
groups I worked so hard for." 
</P>
<P>
CHARITIES THAT PAID MATHER FOR INSURANCE 
</P>
<P>
To date, five charities in Orange and Los Angeles counties have indicated they 
were without insurance or were issued questionable insurance policies by Scott 
Mather: 
</P>
<P>
* Anaheim Interfaith Shelter paid Mather $5,000 for liability and property 
insurance over a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
* Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter paid Mather $5,000 in premiums for a 
supplemental liability policy that was not issued and subsequently found to 
duplicate a policy the group already had. 
</P>
<P>
* Share Our Selves paid $1,350 for liability insurance to cover the agency's 
medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
* Harbor Interfaith Shelter of San Pedro paid Mather $16,000 in premiums over a 
five-year period for general liability and property insurance. 
</P>
<P>
* Friendship Shelter in Laguna Beach was without general liability and fire 
insurance policies that were supposed to have been provided by Mather. Agency 
directors declined to specify how long they were without insurance or the 
amount paid to Mather.

HEDGECOCK'S VOICE STILL REVERBERATES AROUND CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His is arguably one of the most influential voices at San Diego City Hall. Yet 
it originates not in the council chambers or mayor's office or any of the 
administrative suites, but rather in a small studio roughly 10 miles -- and, in 
his words, "a lifetime" -- away. 
</P>
<P>
There, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. every weekday, former San Diego Mayor Roger 
Hedgecock presides over what he describes as a "town meeting of the airwaves" 
on KSDO radio -- a program that not only is among the most successful radio 
talk shows in local history, but that also plays a sometimes potent role in 
major civic affairs both inside and outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear people talking about it all the time -- decision-makers as well as 
people you meet when you go door-to-door," City Councilman Bruce Henderson 
said. "In terms of influence, I'd say Roger's show is as important as any of 
the local newspapers, and probably more important than any TV news show and 
most (interest) groups." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, nearly 4 1/2 years after his ignominious departure from City Hall 
following his conviction on campaign-law violations, Hedgecock, thanks to his 
program's strong following, remains a figure to be reckoned with in the 
formulation of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
The popular four-hour show not only has preserved -- and perhaps enhanced -- 
Hedgecock's high profile, but also has come to be widely seen as a critical 
barometer of public sentiment. As a result, Hedgecock has been able to frame 
public debate and, occasionally, even help shape governmental action on issues 
ranging from property taxes and a proposed multibillion-dollar secondary sewage 
plant to illegal immigration and council members' office renovations. 
</P>
<P>
"The ironic thing -- and probably the thing that pleases me most -- is that the 
show has allowed me to accomplish much of what I wanted to accomplish as mayor, 
particularly in regard to getting the public more involved," Hedgecock said in 
an interview. "That's very satisfying because four, five years ago, I never 
thought I'd have that chance again." 
</P>
<P>
Within political circles, Hedgecock's program is sometimes half-jokingly called 
San Diego's government in exile, or, as one consultant described it, "the ghost 
of mayors past." 
</P>
<P>
At City Hall and throughout San Diego, "Did you hear what Roger said today?" is 
a common question, and no one has to bother to ask, "Roger who?" Letters and 
telephone calls to council and other city officials' offices often point to 
Hedgecock's show as the motivating force behind them. Council members, however, 
also credit Hedgecock with authoring cost-saving ideas that they have pursued, 
and advocates of various causes say his willingness to publicize their issues 
has had a galvanizing effect on their programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I can give you the main reason for the success we've had in one word: Roger," 
said Audrey Bergner, one of the organizers of the periodic "Light Up the 
Border" demonstrations in which San Diegans illuminate the U.S.-Mexican border 
with their automobile headlights to protest the nightly crossings of illegal 
immigrants. "After Roger got involved, this thing went absolutely bananas." 
</P>
<P>
While the consensus within political and social circles reflects at least a 
grudging admission of Hedgecock's continued clout, some people -- particularly 
past opponents -- are quick to dismiss the former mayor and his talk show as 
equally insignificant blips on the political radar screen. 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of the 1st (City Council) District, he has no impact at 
all," said Joanne Johnson, the administrative assistant to Councilwoman Abbe 
Wolfsheimer. Significantly, however, Wolfsheimer herself expresses displeasure 
with Hedgecock's "regular Abbe-bashing." 
</P>
<P>
To Hedgecock's critics, the radio program is merely an exercise in ego 
gratification, a daily dosage of self-delusion that allows him to still view 
himself as a key player -- albeit one who has been forced to the sidelines -- 
in city politics. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hedgecock prides himself on his ability to use his program to help 
mold public opinion, skeptics contend he less often leads the charge than jumps 
aboard a popular bandwagon, and then claims credit with a false modesty. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that there's anything tangible that comes out of his show in 
terms of what happens at City Hall," said Paul Downey, Mayor Maureen O'Connor's 
press secretary. "I can't think of a single instance where there was any 
evidence that Roger or any other talk-show host had any impact here." 
</P>
<P>
That belittling contention undeniably owes much to O'Connor's lingering enmity 
toward Hedgecock as a result of his narrow victory in their bitter 1983 mayoral 
race. Hedgecock achieved that victory, a Superior Court jury decided in 1985, 
by relying on illegal campaign donations from the now-defunct La Jolla 
investment firm of J. David &amp; Co. Hedgecock is appealing the 13-count 
felony conviction and one-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Most people, however, are more charitable in their assessment of Hedgecock and 
his show's effect. City Councilman Ron Roberts perhaps comes closest to an 
objective appraisal, saying that Hedgecock's show is perhaps neither as 
influential as its host might like to think nor as trifling as his critics 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger would like to act like everything that happens here is because of his 
program," Roberts said. "That's obviously an exaggeration, but there's no 
question he has a strong listenership and that his opinions and the show carry 
some weight." 
</P>
<P>
In discussing his program, Hedgecock consistently emphasizes two points: He has 
no intention of ever parlaying the high visibility it gives him into a 
political comeback, and his audience, not he, deserves most of the credit for 
the show's impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to use the show to build a power base, because I'm never going 
to run for office again," Hedgecock said. "In political terms, I'm dead -- dead 
as a doornail. And that's fine with me. 
</P>
<P>
"What this show comes down to isn't me, it's the listeners. I keep telling 
them, you're the powerful people who are changing the political landscape. 
Alone, I'm nothing -- in fact, I'm probably a minus because of my personal 
reputation. I'm a vehicle and a facilitator -- no more, no less." 
</P>
<P>
Based on recent ratings, an estimated 200,000 San Diegans listen to Hedgecock's 
program at some point during the week. The size of that audience, combined with 
Hedgecock's impressive mastery of myriad subjects -- presented in an 
entertaining if often acerbic manner -- and the evolution of the show itself, 
are the major factors behind the program's growing influence. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the show followed a fairly common talk-show format heavy on "diet 
books and sex-life advice," Hedgecock concedes. Over time, however, he 
increasingly assumed the role of ombudsman for his listeners' complaints with 
government, and substantive local issues became one of the show's staples. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets down to the nuts and bolts, people know I lived there," Hedgecock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, when city officials began warning of a looming budget crisis 
and possible deep cuts in critical services and programs, Hedgecock delved into 
the subject by reading on air at random from the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock's background not only gave him incisive insights into the budget -- 
Roberts, for example, is pursuing his suggestion that hundreds of thousands of 
dollars could be saved through consolidation of the city and county crime labs 
-- but also guided him to politically embarrassing areas. Among the dark 
corners he gleefully illuminated were the amounts spent on the mayoral and 
council staffs, subsidies to red-ink programs and many other eclectic purposes 
tucked away in the $1-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
"When people find out we're spending money to build sand castles in Mission 
Beach at the same time the city says it doesn't have enough money to hire more 
police, they go crazy," Hedgecock said. "People aren't going to get that kind 
of information anywhere else, because the politicians would just as soon they 
not hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite tactics is to broadcast the addresses or telephone numbers 
of the public officials who oversee the programs or policies he spotlights -- a 
gambit that does not often endear him to the individuals involved. Once, KSDO 
listeners clogged San Diego City Manager John Lockwood's telephone lines -- 
interfering with normal city business -- after Hedgecock complained on the air 
about the perceived runaround he was getting in trying to secure Lockwood as a 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hedgecock resorted to the same tactic to get an interview with 
County Supervisor Leon Williams about a work-release detention program. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people will say that's a little juvenile," Hedgecock said. "But at least 
it caused John Lockwood to sit up and take notice and be accountable. The fact 
is, nobody at City Hall is very comfortable with a lot of people getting 
involved in these things. It's like teachers saying they want more parent 
participation -- until they get it. Politicians are the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Often, it is difficult to quantify Hedgecock's impact, especially on 
controversial issues where his program is only one of many factors that incite 
a strong public reaction. On a number of occasions, however, his program has 
clearly affected both public debate and policy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when the California Public Utilities Commission authorized a $4.80 
monthly surcharge on San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. bills, Hedgecock helped 
angry customers devise a strategy to challenge the fee increase and kept up a 
steady stream of on-air criticism. When hundreds attended public hearings to 
protest the surcharge -- a turnout for which other groups, notably the Utility 
Consumers Action Network (UCAN), also deserve credit -- the commission reversed 
its decision. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock also helped whip up public outrage over a $20-million property tax 
increase the City Council approved in February, then rescinded two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
"We blew them out of the water on that one," Hedgecock said. 
</P>
<P>
However, several council members who changed their votes downplay Hedgecock's 
role, saying they switched because they erroneously thought at the time of the 
initial vote that they were simply putting the tax measure on the ballot, not 
approving it. 
</P>
<P>
The city's plan to build a federally mandated secondary sewage treatment plant 
estimated to cost up to $2.8 billion has been a regular topic of debate on the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the major reasons why those of us who feel this (plant) isn't 
necessary and could bankrupt the city . . . have been able to make those points 
to the public," said Henderson, who argues that scientific evidence shows that 
the millions of gallons of treated sewage the city pumps offshore each day do 
not harm the ocean. "On this and other issues, he has tremendous credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, organizers of the "Light Up the Border" protests regard Hedgecock as 
a near savior for their cause. Before his involvement -- more particularly, to 
his publicizing the events on his program -- only several dozen autos showed up 
at the first several nighttime protests. But, after Hedgecock began trumpeting 
the issue, about 425 cars and more than 1,000 people were at the protest in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally went car to car asking people why they showed up, and everyone 
said, 'Roger told me to be here,' " said Bergner, head of the Alliance for 
Border Control. "He's why this thing took off." 
</P>
<P>
From Henderson's perspective, the show's impact demonstrates that Hedgecock the 
talk-show host retains Hedgecock the politician's eye for recognizing a popular 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear people say, 'Boy, Roger's really on a toot about this issue,' 
you know it's because he's felt the pulse of the public and realizes what gets 
people excited," Henderson said. "Good politicians know when they've hit a raw 
nerve. And no one ever said Roger wasn't a good politician." 
</P>
<P>
That ability to exploit public opinion, Hedgecock argues, points up a 
significant similarity between his current and former jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"As an officeholder, your hands are on the levers of power -- you can make the 
bureaucracy move and get things done," he said. "But none of that happens 
without first trying to organize and manipulate public opinion. So now I try to 
shape public opinion in a way that has an indirect yet significant impact upon 
those who make the decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock's success in doing so, Roberts adds, allows his show to serve a 
valuable purpose akin to the press' watchdog role toward government. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds you that people are looking over your shoulder, and that's a good 
thing in politics," Roberts said. "Not that people go around saying, 'Gee, I 
wonder what Roger will think about this?' But, when you know someone's 
watching, you spend more time trying to do the right thing."

Jerry Greenberg, president of WTG Records, found himself in a Philadelphia 
warehouse a few weeks ago, watching his prize rookie in action. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Cordero, the Santa Ana-based singer whose stage name, Louie Louie, was 
pinned on him during his days as a teen-age dancing flash in Orange County 
nightclubs, was singing to a crowd of warehouse employees, youngsters whose job 
it is to pack shipping crates full of records destined for retail shops. What 
Greenberg heard was music to a record executive's ears. 
</P>
<P>
"They were screaming by the time he was through," Greenberg recalled over the 
phone from his Los Angeles office. "One girl yelled out, 'I'M going to throw 
out my Bobby Brown records! From now on, Louie, you it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The scene underscored what Greenberg and others at CBS Records (WTG's parent 
company) suspect about this 25-year-old singer with the fashion model's face, 
athlete's physique, street-dancer's moves, and -- in a genre where many a 
success story is all window-dressing and no substance -- the ability to write 
snappy songs an dsing them with authority. Louie Louie just might be it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Latin world has never had an Elvis, a Prince, one of those totally unique 
artists," said Bobby Colomby, the former Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears drummer who, 
as a CBS Records executive, has served as Louie Louie's coach and mentor. "This 
may be it. He may be the guy." 
</P>
<P>
While Louie Louie's just released debut album, "The State I'm In", won't 
challenge early Elvis or prime Prince on anyone's list of groundbreaking 
records, it is state-of-the-art dance pop that might well induce the fans of a 
star like Bobby Brown to set their favorite albums aside (if not throw them 
out) and give this part-Puerto Rican, part-Irish contender a spin. 
</P>
<P>
What they will hear is a record that incorporates rock, funk, rap and Latin 
music while painting story-sketches of love and sex that manage to go beyond 
the deadening cliches of much dance music. The early signs are that Louie will 
get more than a fair hearing: An initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies 
of the album has been sent to record stores, according to Greenberg, and the 
single, "Sittin' in the Lap of Luxury," which featuers trumpet flourishes from 
Dizzy Gillespie, is being added rapidly to radio play lists. 
</P>
<P>
As for Louie, he doesn't appear to have been caught off balance by the touting 
of highly placed backers or the onset of great commercial expectations. Far 
from falling into the spotlight, Louie has been courting stardom all along. It 
is what he has pursued for the past six years -- deliberately, aggressively, 
and in the face of setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a person who walks in the room, and every head turns," Colomby says, his 
I-love-Louie rap slipping into high gear. "There are a lot of attractive people 
out there. He has an intrinsic charisma that's magical, and he's a good kid. 
He's not one of these maniacal people who spends his life trying to think of 
how he can step over other people to make it." 
</P>
<P>
In person, Louie Cordero turns out to be one of those people who can charm 
almost without trying. Looks play a part in that: With his copper skin and high 
cheekbones, he has the chiseled appearance of a young Indian brave. Streaks of 
blue ribbon running through his black hair lend a touch of the exotic that is 
further embellished by the patch of dyed-blond hair above Louie's neckline, and 
the rap-fashion cornrows furrowed into his temple. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview at a Costa Mesa restaurant, Louie was self-assured 
without ever seeming arrogant, overbearing, or too full of himself. Most of the 
time Louie would lean forward, fixing a listener with brown eyes locked in 
concentration. But thornier questions about such issues as the inner motivation 
behind is arena-size ambitions would prompt a commentary retreat. Louie would 
ease back in the restaurant booth, slumping a little, as if to huddle with 
himself. Lifting his right hand to his mouth, gnawing the thumb lightly as he 
thought, he seemed to be making an earnest effort to render an honest 
accounting for a drive that must by now be so internalized that he never much 
considers it. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I need gratification constantly," Louie offered after a long pause. 
Stardom "is the most incredible thing that could ever happen to somebody. Ever 
since I was a kid, I wanted to be on TV or in the movies. I t attracted me 
because if you're famliar to everybody in the world, it seems safer. I have 
this thing, I always have to perform. I don't think people know me unless they 
see me perform." 
</P>
<P>
Louie's introduction to pop stardom came from the radio. When he was a boy, he 
would spend Sunday mornings listening to Casey Kasem's weekly "American Top 
Forty" show, paying special attention to the informational tidbits about the 
performers that Kasem would sprinkle through the program's countdown of hits. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom would buy a lot of music magazines, like Hit Parader," Louie recalled. 
"They'd be lying around and I'd read lyrics of songs." 
</P>
<P>
Louie said the family hopscotched from town to town in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties, until he ultimately graduated from El Toro High School. His father, 
Louis Cordero, was a businessman who ran liquor stores and markets, then went 
into car sales; he and Louie's mother divorced when Louie was in his teens. The 
second oldest in a family of four boys and two girls, Louie got a day job as a 
car salesman, but his real goal was to be persuasive on the dance floor. "I 
always wanted to be a singer, but I didn't think I could . . . (so) I pursued 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"You need confidence. As soon as you get the confidence to sing, you can sing," 
Louie said, offering the first of many maxims about show business that he 
readily drops. 
</P>
<P>
"Singing was exactly what I wanted to do," Louie said. "So I was scared. It's 
like you had the perfect girl, and you shy away from her because you don't want 
to get married." 
</P>
<P>
But Louie wasn't shy about holding the spotlight on the dance floor of local 
nightclubs, where he would perform in baggy '40s-style Zoot suits or '50s 
rockabilly regalia. He became a regular competitor in club dance contests, 
vying for prizes decided by audience response. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a point of view, a style," Louie said (another maxim). "I 
think I had that before my music did. I developed a character and a stage 
presence before I had the music. The contests were part of shaping it. The Red 
Onion is harder to perform at than the Forum. The people at the club didn't 
come just to see a dance contest. So I learned how to work an audience, connect 
with everybody in the room." 
</P>
<P>
Louie's dance club successes led to auditions for dance-oriented films being 
shot in Los Angeles around the time of the break-dancing craze. At one of those 
auditions, he says, he was spotted by a director who was preparing to shoot a 
video for a still-emerging singer named Madonna. Louie wound up playing the 
leading man's role opposite Madonna in the 1984 "Borderline" video. The song 
became the first Top Ten hit of her career. 
</P>
<P>
Louie says that for a time he squired Madonna around Los Angeles on dates. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just driving down the 10 Freeway and a song came on the radio," he 
recalled. "I started singing, and she looked at me in amazement: 'My God, you 
can sing too.' " At the time, he said, he had never sung in public. 
</P>
<P>
Louie said that Madonna's manager, Freddy DeMann, took an interest in him and 
encouraged him to start writing songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I had all these big people telling me I had something," he said. "It was like 
an awakening. It kept me going. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a ruder awakening. "I was going to go on tour dancing with Madonna, 
and it didn't work out. That was let-down No. 1. She had hired a choreographer, 
which was the right thing for her to do. But (the choreographer wanted) jazz 
dancing, not street dancing, and that's not what I'm about." 
</P>
<P>
Louie says he lost contact with Madonna as her career took off. But Ron 
Weisner, who had been part of her management team, continued to take an 
interest in him "because of his persistence." 
</P>
<P>
"He was very serious about his career," recalled Weisner, who now manages Paul 
McCartney and Steve Winwood. "I told him it's a frustrating business. I told 
him at the time, 'You've got to be able to deal with people saying no to you' . 
. . (but) he's serious about what he's doing -- and he's a nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," Weisner continued, "you see people who have talent, and you put 
them together with somebody who might enhance that." Weisner helped Louie hook 
up with Giorgio Moroder, the successful disco-era record producer. Louie says 
he sang at some 1985 recording sessions produced by Moroder and his studio 
assistants. But Louie and Moroder never reached a formal business agreement 
that might have led to a record release. 
</P>
<P>
That fruitless episode led Louie to his next important patron: his own father. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got into music, he was absolutely not supportive," said Louie, 
who quit selling cars after his "Borderline" break. "I kind of was away from my 
family for a year. But when he found out Giorgio Moroder was working with me, 
that I was serious about it and it was not another whim, my dad gave me money." 
</P>
<P>
Louie says his father equipped him with home recording gear and gave him the 
use of a house he owned in Santa Ana. Louie began to build a band, which at one 
point featured the dancer Cat, who later went on to perform in Prince's band. 
His current lineup, which will begin touring this summer, includes 
dancer-percussionist Sam Masarani, singer B.J. Smith, percussionist Gino G., 
drummer Herb Graham and bassist Tony Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
The next stop on Louie's climb was the La Habra recording studio of Jon St. 
James, whose work with Stacey Q and Bardeux had made him Orange County's most 
commercial successful record producer. 
</P>
<P>
St. James, who began working with Louie in 1987, found him to be a natural 
performer, willing to communicate his musical ideas in the most elemental way: 
by just getting up and singing them. 
</P>
<P>
"Louie's very flamboyant, and if you give him a chance to shine, he'll take 
over," St. James said. "He'd walk in and start singing a cappella at the top of 
his lungs. He'd come into the studio and say, 'Jon, you've got to hear this,' 
and he'd start singing and dancing around." 
</P>
<P>
That lack of inhibition carried over into Louie's stage act, recalled Romi 
Marie, St. James' assistant at the time. The consensus around St. James' 
Formula One Studio was that Louie's outrageous shows weren't helping him. 
</P>
<P>
"In all honesty, a lot of people (in the music business) didn't take Louie 
seriously," said Marie, who first brought the singer to St. James' attention. 
"His type of dancing was like exotic dancing, real risque. He had Spandex pants 
that were cut up, with holes all over him. A lot of people were saying, 'It's 
too Chippendales.' " 
</P>
<P>
Louie recorded one single with St. James, "The Girl Who Seduced the World." The 
song, written by St. James and released on the Synthecide/Enigma label, was 
roundly ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"When he wanted to do a second record (Enigma) wasn't committed to it," St. 
James recalled. "They said, 'Wait and see.' Louie got an attorney and got out 
of the (recording) deal. I don't blame him for it. He's very impatient. He 
wants to be a star overnight. I think anybody who has that quality wants to be. 
That's how they get there. I envisioned him as another Prince." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt constantly let down," Louie said of his string of early disappointments 
with Madonna, Moroder and St. James. "I always blamed it on myself, that I'm 
not that good, that I had to get better. But I kind of like to fail. You have 
to have a lot of humbling experiences, because then you know where you come 
from." 
</P>
<P>
Though Louie didn't get a hit out of his tenure under St. James, he did acquire 
a manager, Kelly Newby. Louie's script for stardom required somebody cast in 
the Freddy DeMann patron role, and Newby filled it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking again for somebody to say the (encouraging) things that Freddy 
said, "Louie recalled. "You need people to believe almost more than you do to 
get to the next level." By late 1988, Newby's contacts as a former film and 
television agent had moved Louie to the level he wanted: a major label 
recording contract. 
</P>
<P>
Colomby, a friend of Newby's, saw Louie and his band play in Los Angeles and 
agreed to work with him as musical adviser (Louie refers to Colomby -- who 
previously had coached Richard Marx, among others -- as "like a navigator"). 
</P>
<P>
When pop singer Martika, a former television client of Newby's, saw Louie she 
became so enthused that she called Tommy Mottola, president of CBS Records. 
Mottola, based in New York, asked WTG's Greenberg to take a look. Greenberg, 
seeking acts for the newly formed subsidiary label, liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
Louie, meanwhile, was beginning to realize that the more extreme moves that had 
won him acclaim in the Los Angeles and Orange County dance clubs might not go 
over as well with the mass audience he wanted to reach. 
</P>
<P>
"I toned it down," he said. "I took a lot of the sex out of the show because 
people were coming for that instead of the songs. As the songs got better, I 
wanted to concentrate on the songs." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his dance floor beginnings, Louie wanted his songs to do more than 
recycle the usual dance cliches. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can write a song about that, about pushing to the groove, or moving to 
the beat," Louie said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think songs about sex and dancing (aren't enough). There should be a lesson 
in every song. I think my album is like an emotional roller coaster. It takes 
you up and down, and around." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the album has its share of sex songs, but Louie typically manages 
to weave a narrative situation around his romantic-encounter material. "Sittin' 
in the Lap of Luxury," for example, embellishes the story of a young gigolo 
with a bit of psychological underpinning for the character's life of luxurious 
sin. Louie also gives the song a happily redemptive, true-romance ending. It 
isn't exactly Bob Dylan, but compared to such dance-pop competitors as Paula 
Abdul and Milli Vanilli, Louie's method seems adventurous and complex. 
</P>
<P>
The album's best song, "The State I'm In," moves from nervous urgency to 
gospel-tinged celebration as Louie sings about the pressures he encounters in 
the outside world, and his own determination to find an inner balance that will 
let him rise above it. The song is a catchy, propulsive rallying cry for 
positive change. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Greenberg figured that Louie's debut held enough promise to merit some 
unusual promotional attention. The veteran music executve, formerly with 
Atlantic Records, left his label president's desk and shepherded Louie around 
the Northeast on a recent pre-release jaunt aimed at winning over radio 
programmers, journalists and buyers for record store chains. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said the last performer he had personally introduced in that way was 
Jason Bonham, son of the late drummer for Led Zeppelin, a band Greenberg had 
worked with in his Atlantic days. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do it for every artist, but every once in a while there's somebody 
special like Louie Louie," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
What all this means is that highly placed people in the music business are 
seeing Louie in the same light in which he has always seen himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Forum-level concert shows," Louie replied when asked the extent of his 
ambitions. "It's so big that it doesn't have any boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the release of more than 100,000 copies of his just-released album, "The 
State I'm In,"

"You'd be surprised at the responses I get from people when I tell them I'm 
playing the phantom of the opera," Robert Guillaume says, laughing'Well, what 
are you gonna do in it? Tell jokes? Are you gonna make it a comedy?' People 
think it's Benson who'll be doing it." 
</P>
<P>
No, it won't be TV's butler-turned-lieutenant-governor playing the deformed, 
mad, lovesick composer in Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit musical. Starting Tuesday, 
it will be Guillaume, a veteran stage actor with an operatically trained voice, 
who will start wearing the mask at the Ahmanson Theatre. The show's original 
star, Michael Crawford, gives his final performance today. 
</P>
<P>
"We cast Robert Guillaume because we auditioned countless people and he, by 
far, displayed the most authority and elegance," director Harold Prince said in 
a statement released through the show's publicity office. "He has a lovely 
voice and a great command and understanding of the role. He has an intellect; 
he looks like a man who could write symphonies and operas and design 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Guillaume is having a quick lunch at one of Broadway's casual hangouts just 
before starting that day's rehearsal with Prince. He's clearly, and quietly, 
thrilled. And take a look at this guy. How can he be 62? 
</P>
<P>
"This will have nothing to do with what I'm known for," he says. "It's the 
first time I've ever done a role that's so distant from who I think I am." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a long path to the Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
A year after his manager called "Phantom" producer Cameron Mackintosh in 
January, 1989, to say he was interested in the role, Guillaume finally 
auditioned with the ballad "Music of the Night," once in Los Angeles and twice 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The third time was when I felt maybe it will happen," says Guillaume. "Either 
they wanted me, or they were wasting an awful lot of time." But there was never 
a moment when he was sure he'd clinched it. "I always feel like I don't do as 
well as I would like to, and when I get a part, I always feel like they were 
bamboozled enough to buy it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule's been pretty crazy since he was told he got the part the last 
week in March. Within days, Guillaume began two weeks of rehearsal with 
production supervisor Mitchell Lemsky and stage manager David Rubinstein in Los 
Angeles. He came here to work with Prince, who couldn't go to Los Angeles 
because he's rehearsing a new musical version of "Kiss of the Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Experience tells Guillaume that five weeks of preparation aren't enough to 
perfect a role this complicated, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I know right now that my performance on May 1 won't be definitive, because 
this part grows and grows and grows, and your command gets better." 
</P>
<P>
He'll have plenty of time to settle into it -- he's signed on for the rest of 
1990 and the show has an open-ended run. But he also has a job making the part 
his own, since Crawford won just about every award possible for his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly wouldn't be trying to convince anyone of any comparison between 
Michael and myself," he says. "I don't think I'm competing with anyone." His 
preparation includes "immersing in the psychological drama inside the person, 
by going behind the words, the music, the events, into some extreme beauty and 
some madness. This guy has a slippery hold on sanity, so everything looks very 
romantic." 
</P>
<P>
Playing the Phantom will require a whole different action technique than he's 
used to, since no one will see his eyes and face. The way he uses his hands and 
body will be especially important, Guillaume says, plus "you have to carry a 
lot of emotional characterization in your voice. It has to be very clear." 
</P>
<P>
Born in St. Louis, Guillaume studied voice at Washington University there, then 
went on to a scholarship at the Aspen Music Festival. He spent 17 years on and 
off Broadway in New York, and was nominated for a Tony for his portrayal of 
Nathan Detroit in the 1976 revival of "Guys and Dolls." He also starred in 
"Purlie" and "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris." 
</P>
<P>
After the theater, Guillaume played Benson Duvois from 1977 to 1986, first on 
"Soap" and then on his own show, and won two Emmy Awards. Next, he took to the 
nightclub circuit playing Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and Atlantic City, and made 
theatrical films, like "Lean on Me," and made-for-TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never stopped taking singing lessons," Guillaume says. "I was planning to 
do concerts before this came up." 
</P>
<P>
Physically and vocally, "Phantom" is a demanding show. "I think a television 
show is a snap compared to this," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"On a sitcom, you live a fairly normal life. Four days a week, it almost 
corresponds to a 9-to-5 gig, and the one day you tape you may go until 11 at 
night, but you don't get in until 1 in the afternoon. Most of the technical 
aspects are on somebody else's shoulders, and all you have to do is put your 
body in front of the camera and make whatever you're doing plausible." 
</P>
<P>
But with the complicated effects of "Phantom," it will be a whole different 
story. "Now you talk about fear! There's a whole lot of machinery in this show, 
and I don't know what the margin of error is. I want to make sure that part of 
my head doesn't go the other way or my nose doesn't snap off as I fall through 
the trap door. I had a couple of nightmares about that," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
There's a strange juggling act going on here -- calmness, no need to banter for 
an interview, and he says he's learned "you can't work with fear." But he talks 
about fear over and over again -- for example, how he feels at the end of the 
first act when the Phantom lets the fabled chandelier drop while standing on a 
narrow ledge at the top of the golden proscenium arch that re-creates the Paris 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to make sure you step verrrry carefully," Guillaume says. "You don't 
want to wear any slick-soled periwinkles up there." 
</P>
<P>
And the first time he flew up into the rococo angel sculpture that hovers over 
center stage, it was a lot scarier than he thought it would be. "It sways as 
you go up," he says, and with glazed eyes, he rocks slowly, side to side, front 
to back. 
</P>
<P>
The process of putting on the layers of makeup will take about an hour. "That's 
going to be a real challenge -- singing through all this mess," Guillaume says. 
</P>
<P>
The makeup is not interchangeable between actors. It has to fit like a second 
skin. Even the Phantom's signature mask will be uniquely molded to fit him. To 
create layers of latex and wigs, makeup artists Barry R.Koper, Tiffany Hicks 
and Geino Acevedo took a rubbery mold of Guillaume's head, neck and shoulders, 
and he had to sit still for 90 minutes while it hardened. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say that if I'd known about all this before, I'd have stayed at the 
Post Office," he deadpanned. Mailman, candy cook, accountant and Army clerk are 
just some of the jobs Guillaume has held, and he studied business 
administration in college before turning to opera. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's part of a small international army of performers to take on the 
Phantom. In addition to Los Angeles, "The Phantom of the Opera" is currently 
playing in London, New York, Tokyo, Toronto, Stockholm and Vienna. It's also 
scheduled to open this year in Budapest, Hamburg and Melbourne, and the 
American touring company will open in Chicago in June. In addition, there is 
the upcoming film version being planned by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the fact that he's stepping into a hit, Guillaume says winning the role 
represents a dream he's always had of being cast for a part regardless of race. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Kristien, who is white, will continue to play Christine, the object of the 
Phantom's desires; the fact that Guillaume is black is not considered an issue 
by the producers, the director or Guillaume. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be searching for those things that transcend color," says Guillaume. 
"Color has nothing to do with this." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the case with "The Robert Guillaume Show," a 1989 mid-season 
replacement for ABC, where he was co-creator and executive co-producer. 
Guillaume's character, a divorced marriage counselor, had a romantic 
relationship with his white receptionist, played by Wendy Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Did the black/white issue influence the show's chances for renewal? "I'm sure 
in some sense it did," he replies, "but so what? Shows get taken off for all 
kinds of reasons, most of which seem pretty bizarre to the people involved." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he shakes off rejection and cancellations seems to be part of 
what he calls being "practical-minded." 
</P>
<P>
"I've always refused to see myself as other people see me, especially when the 
way they see me is derogatory. I go with opinions of myself which are positive, 
and when I encounter those which aren't, I don't pay much attention to them. 
And that's not whistling in the dark. That's actually the best way I've found 
to live my life." 
</P>
<P>
Guillaume gets in a cab with his visitor to head downtown to 890 Broadway, 
where most of the big musicals in New York rehearse, and where director Prince 
is waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
"This is sort of a second life," he says. Guillaume remarried four years ago, 
and he and his wife, Donna, have a 16-month-old daughter. "The baby is a joy," 
he says. "You become acutely aware of how fragile life is, of vulnerability." 
</P>
<P>
And what about his older children? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," he says, and looks away. So much for personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
The cab stops at a light, and a stranger sticks his head in the window. "Hey, 
Benson!" he calls. Guillaume sits up straight and laughs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, how're you doin'?" he asks the stranger. It upsets other actors, he 
knows, to still be closely associated with a character, "but it doesn't worry 
me," he says. "It simply means that I might have been successful in the part." 
</P>
<P>
For right now, he isn't looking beyond the end of the run of "Phantom," but 
Longridge Enterprises, his production company, will continue to develop 
projects for him. "I still see this whole process in the theater as continual 
growth, up until the time you cash in your chips," he says. " 'Phantom' is not 
where I want to stop."

Guillaume then steps out of the cab, goes into the lobby at 890 Broadway, gets 
in line with unknown actors and gypsies, and waits for the ancient elevator 
that will take him up to rehearsal.

BENTON'S EPICS FROM THE SOIL; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBITION AT LACMA SHOWS THE GREAT REGIONALIST ONCE AGAIN IS SPEAKING TO 
AEMRICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decade ended, the world seemed to crumble like a chimney falling in slow 
motion. The wreckage revealed grimy scraps of gilt-edged securities, broken 
bottles of bathtub gin, the fender of a yellow Stutz Bearcat -- detritus of 
good times gone. Bony derelicts would soon rummage in the rubble to a harmonica 
tune asking, "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? " 
</P>
<P>
When the market crashed in '29 people got scared of racy ideas that had fueled 
their roaring decade in the same way they would get scared again at the end of 
the '60s. Have we gone too far? Is all this misery God's punishment for the 
hooch, the easy sex and rebellion against The Establishment? Neoconservative 
nervousness set in as it did again in the '80s traumatized over drugs, and AIDS 
and longing for the simple solutions of the old-time religion. The '20s had 
Father Coughlin, we had Rev. Falwell. They had the Scopes trial, we have 
abortion rights wrangles. Whatever, it's still religion vs. science. Our 
legions of homeless and economic uncertainties are like theirs, except, of 
course, we don't have a Depression. Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was international then, too. In Paris, Picasso started painting in his 
Neo-Classical manner. England looked at the discouraged realism of Gwen John 
and Walter Sickert. Hitler replaced modernism with Fascist Realism. Abstract 
art, associated with left-wing radicalism, was on the run. In the United 
States, the new hero was Thomas Hart Benton. His big, ropy murals depicting 
hillbillies and good old boys and girls of Heartland America reassured people 
that Yankee values were safe as strongboxes. Now once again we find easily 
accessible art agreeable. We have David Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art opens a revivalist retrospective of 
Benton's art. It manages to be artistically absorbing despite the necessary 
absence of his major works, the unmoveable murals. More importantly, it feels 
less like an art exhibition than the point in a historical cycle where the 
vectors of past and present come together -- making new beginnings possible. 
There is something quite awesome about it. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that would make its significance clearer would be a back-to-back 
retrospective of the art of Jackson Pollock. Pollock is the invisible actor 
whose specter establishes the broader significance of this exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was Pollock's teacher, mentor, surrogate father and drinking buddy at 
New York's Art Student's League in the early '30s. The fact has long been 
known. Until now the relationship tended to be characterized as one where 
Pollock rebeled against a fuddy-duddy teacher. Today it looks different, thanks 
to the exemplary Benton catalogue by Henry Adams and to a controversial recent 
Pollock biography widely read in art circles, "Jackson Pollock: An American 
Saga" by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. Rolled together, the two books 
and the exhibition show that Benton and his art were intensely modern at bottom 
and that Pollock and his art would have been all but impossible without the 
older man. 
</P>
<P>
There was indeed a kind of mythic Oedipal struggle between them but it was less 
personal than generational, a fact that links both to the larger history of 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Benton led an artificially manufactured back-to-the-roots art movement called 
Regionalism whose other heroes were Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry. People 
loved Benton's salty, pugnacious manner and wrangled delightedly over bold 
murals his detractors called "tabloid art." He once admitted, "I paint 
sometimes to get people to criticize my work." He was so popular in 1934 he 
became the first artist ever to make the cover of Time magazine, leading Andy 
Warhol by decades with an artistic career fueled by publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest Bentons on view at LACMA prove him both talented and urbane. His 
Huck Finn image was always something of a pose. Born in Neosho, Miss., he was 
the great-nephew of Sen. Thomas Hart Benton. His father was an abusive, macho 
local politician who married an ambitious young beauty who goaded the old man 
into running for Congress. He won and young Tom grew up as much in the 
political climate of Washington as anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
At 19, he went to Paris where he kept a mistress until his mother came and 
broke it up. He painted his sister Mildred in a realist style with a whiff of 
Gustav Klimt. He worked in the manner of Cezanne, the Impressionists and in the 
abstract "Synchronist" style of his imperious pal Stanton MacDonald Wright. A 
handsome late portrait shows real affection and admiration for his difficult 
old friend. 
</P>
<P>
Serious family financial reverses forced his return to the States. He settled 
into his Hopeful Years in New York where he married Rita Piacenza, who suffered 
his egotism with good grace. She manipulated his career like a maestro. 
Traumatized by the death of his father, he started disappearing on long trips 
into Missouri and the Ozarks. He discovered the Italian 16th-Century mannerist 
Tintoretto. Benton absorbed his style and his method of working from clay 
models. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was meticulous in his working habits. From all this he developed the 
distinctive regionalist style that critics scorned for its Old Master sources. 
Delacroix and Gericault are already in "People of Chilmark." Later, you can see 
the influence of Brueghel and the Flemish Primitives. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of World War II it was all over for Benton. His agrarian America was 
swamped by industrialized suburbia just as today mighty industry has become the 
rust belt and technology is king. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was relegated to the status of a colorful has-been. He was accused of 
being a fascist, even though, in truth, he was a left-wing populist. Then, as 
now, his wrangles with fellow artists such as his arch enemy Stuart Davis took 
on nasty political overtones. In fact, it was only a territorial battle between 
abstract and figurative art, which were seen, respectively, as liberal and 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was accused of being a racist. His paintings of blacks have an element 
of caricature but so do his paintings of everybody. The racist thing rubbed off 
on him from his friend, the critic Thomas Craven, who called photographer and 
Modernist entrepreneur Alfred Stieglitz "a Hoboken Jew without knowledge of or 
interest in the historical American background." 
</P>
<P>
What is true is that Benton was an enthusiastic boozer who -- although married 
with children -- harbored deeply mixed feelings about women and despised 
homosexuals, especially of the arty sort. 
</P>
<P>
When he left New York, disgusted, to return to Missouri in 1935 he wrote, "If 
young gentlemen or old ones either want to wear women's underwear and cultivate 
extraordinary manners it is all right with me. But it is not all right with the 
art they affect and cultivate." 
</P>
<P>
By the '50s, art students were trained to put Benton in the same category of 
popular-artists-to-be-scorned as Norman Rockwell and Andrew Wyeth. Benton, the 
man, hung on until 1975 when he died of a heart attack in his Kansas City 
studio. At 85, he was enjoying something of a revival and had just completed a 
big mural called "The Sources of Country Music." 
</P>
<P>
But the art world's new hero was Pollock. Surely he had learned some of his 
surly macho behavior from Benton. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition makes Benton's fundamental modernity inescapable. A set of large 
studies for "The American Historical Epic" reminds us of El Greco but basically 
the work could not have happened without Cubism. Benton articulated his space 
with curved lines that unite compositions like the snake in the "Laocoon." 
Forms are sculptural but everything pops to the surface as one big 
claustrophobic arabesque. That's where Pollock comes in. He had to have seen 
these pictures and subconsciously transferred the nervous dynamism of their 
basic composition to his famous "drip" paintings. Pollock and Benton shared a 
common compulsiveness. Tom's was wound up tight, Jackson's explosive and 
Dionysiac. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's paintings could not have happened without that quintessential modern 
art form, the movies. There is something of the American pioneer films of Gary 
Cooper and Susan Hayward in the history cycle. "Boomtown" looks like the set 
for some oiler flick with Clark Gable. "Hollywood" is only one of the pictures 
he composed using a cinematic montage technique to cross-cut to related scenes. 
Later he painted Burt Lancaster in "The Kentuckian" and Marlon Brando in 
"Streetcar Named Desire." There's something odd about the whole concept, like a 
novel written after a film. Compared to Edward Hopper's brooding movie palace 
paintings, Benton's seem exhibitionistic and a little jealous. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Benton art comes on like a baroque freight train, it's curiously 
elusive emotionally. There is affection in it but it's like the work of a guy 
who always says, "I love you honey but your feet's too big." Mean around the 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
Benton evokes the whole generation of Depression-era artists from Gropper to 
Shahn and the Soyer brothers. Form is mangled and work seems as haunted as the 
period. A work like "The Hailstorm" is so nightmarish you want to call the 
style "Surregionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has really defined Regionalism according to the feelings it projects. 
It's haunted and inbred like meeting a small-town family whose good manners are 
all about hiding the skeletons in the closet. Benton did two big nudes in 
1938-39. "Persephone" and "Susanna and the Elders." Both deserve the 
contemporary description of one of the pictures as a "skinny-shanked, 
sex-starved Midwest teacher." 
</P>
<P>
In the catalogue Adams links them psychologically to Benton's beautiful 
antiseptic mother and his dirty old dad, but they take on other meanings -- the 
tainted voyeuristic snicker of Erskine Caldwell's novel, "God's Little Acre." 
They transfer Titian's grand manner European style to the Midwest and a great 
erotic tradition takes on a scolding, moralistic tone. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's art is neurotically modern, but it is also inescapable. It broadcasts 
a sense of authenticity to its times and its maker and lends credence to 
President Harry Truman's belief that Benton was "the best damn painter in 
America." His drawing was crabbed but amazingly accurate. He composed complex 
groups of figures with a unity and believability that remains unmatched. No 
artist today with pretensions to making a narrative art can touch him. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, how can you hate him? He once said in a public lecture that the tune 
"Pistol Packin' Mama" is "True art." 
</P>
<P>
Why is this important? After all art is just art and paintings is just 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Blissfully, that is what this exhibition and the books prove wrong. Anyone 
interested in culture will be well rewarded for taking the trouble to plow 
through their combined 1,147 pages. Each humanizes its subject while placing 
him in the context of those roiling, complex times surrounding the Great 
Depression. Their art becomes so clearly crucial to their historical moment 
that it is as impossible to imagine the time without them as without Franklin 
D. Roosevelt or Joe Louis. The art so clearly grows from the soil of real 
events that it seems epic. 
</P>
<P>
If all this fails to convince of the central creative and intellectual role of 
the artist in this culture, then it probably can't be done.

BILLY IDOL: POP'S REBEL WITH A CAUSE;

THE FEISTY ROCK STAR FIDGETS AFTER A MOTORCYCLE MISHAP PUTS HIS CRUCIAL MUSIC 
AND MOVIE PLANS ON HOLD 
</P>

<P>
Billy Idol can still hear the bang of his Harley-Davidson motorcycle colliding 
with a car the morning of Feb. 6 near the intersection of Fountain and Gordon 
in Hollywood. The impact hurled him to the pavement, crushed his right leg and 
left him momentarily unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like (I hit) a brick wall," Idol said in a recent interview. "I 
suppose I sort of blacked out from hitting the street, but I came to very 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing that came to mind was trying to figure out just how badly hurt 
I was. . . . I was lying on my side and I looked at my arm and it was all 
withered up. But the most pain was from my leg. When I lifted it, I could see 
stub (bone) sticking out. . . . I knew then that I wasn't going to be able to 
move. . . . I just laid back and waited for the ambulance." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, Idol -- whose spiky, platinum-blond hair and pouty 
good looks are among rock's most identifiable trademarks -- was on his way back 
to the Hollywood recording studio where, just hours before, he had put the 
final touches on his first album in nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
Idol, 34, had gone home around 2 that morning to sleep before getting his 
Hollywood Hills house ready for his parents, who were going to spend a few days 
with him. But he found he was so keyed up from finishing the album that he 
couldn't sleep. 
</P>
<P>
He felt the album, "Charmed Life," would be an important step in his evolution 
as an artist -- an album that could move him beyond the cartoon-like, 
punk-rebel image conveyed by his string of early hits, including "White 
Wedding" and "Rebel Yell." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that tapes of the new album were being run off at the studio, Idol 
decided around 8 a.m. to go back and pick up a couple of them to play at his 
house for his parents and friends. 
</P>
<P>
The rock singer usually rode his Harley either along La Brea or the Hollywood 
Freeway because he normally went to the studio late at night when there was 
little traffic. But to avoid the morning rush-hour congestion, Idol took a 
different route on Feb. 6, traveling along some unfamiliar side streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a beautiful morning and I was thinking about the tour and how much fun 
it would be to play the new songs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then . . . bang! 
</P>
<P>
When the near-fatal crash was reported on the news that day, it was easy for 
many to assume it was yet another story of a wild rock 'n' roller 
self-destructing. (According to police, Idol was at fault for running a stop 
sign, but no charges are being filed.) 
</P>
<P>
And certainly, for most of the '80s, Idol was one of the most colorful symbols 
of rock rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many other rock stars, Idol was hugely influenced by Elvis Presley. But 
where Bruce Springsteen blended Presley dynamics with Dylan imagination to 
represent the thoughtful, idealistic side of the rock tradition, Idol combined 
the Presley dynamics with the 
</P>
<P>
darker and more unruly attitudes of Jim Morrison and the Sex Pistols. 
</P>
<P>
And Idol, who lived in New York City for most of the '80s, did become caught up 
in rock's fast-lane syndrome after he became one of the first MTV-generation 
rock heroes. In fact, he suggested, there was a time when he could have 
pictured himself ending up a rock casualty. 
</P>
<P>
But those days are past, he said. His move to Los Angeles in 1987 was partly to 
provide a better atmosphere to raise the son he and his girlfriend, actress 
Perri Lister, were expecting, and to adopt a healthier lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when my whole life was in chaos, really, and I didn't help 
myself sort it out," he said, sitting in a chair on the back porch of his 
house. "But one day I came to my senses, and I think I was lucky because a lot 
of people don't." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the motivation came when Lister gave birth to their son, Willem Wolfe 
Broad (Broad is Idol's real last name), now 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really fancy myself being a burned-out father who didn't have the 
energy for raising his son," he said, his right foot in a tight wrapping and 
propped up on a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
"So when Perri was pregnant, I knew it was a time for me to start getting 
really healthy. I also knew that I'd be nearly 35 by the time we hit the road 
again with the band and I didn't fancy getting out there being Belly Idol and 
having no energy and being wasted." 
</P>
<P>
Idol stared at the injured leg, then gazed at the idyllic grounds of the 
residence. A child's basketball hoop was set up on the driveway and a toy 
football lay nearby. (Idol and Lister no longer live together, but share 
custody of the boy.) 
</P>
<P>
"The accident was really just bad luck, though I suppose that anybody who rides 
a motorcycle all day long for three years is looking for trouble," Idol said. 
"At least that's what most people think. They see a motorcycle as something 
wild and crazy . . . that you've got to be out of your mind to ride one. I'm 
sure that's what my dad thinks." 
</P>
<P>
Idol then looked across the lawn to a building that houses a gym where he kept 
in shape during the long months of recording the album. He shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes the whole (incident) kind of ironic," he said finally. "Just 
as I've got back into the peak of fitness, I knock myself out. It's like, 
'Billy Idol cleans up his act, only to (mess) himself up even more.' " 
</P>
<P>
Idol had hoped that by the time of the interview he would be saying goodby to 
the crutches that he has needed since returning home after a four-week stay at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he underwent four operations on his arm and 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
Even off stage, Idol seems to be a barrage of energy -- speaking rapidly and 
punctuating his remarks with all sorts of body language, from sudden hand 
gestures to mock frowns and disarming winks. 
</P>
<P>
The only time he seemed subdued was when he acknowledged he would have to 
return to the hospital for yet another operation, because the lower portion of 
the leg wasn't healing properly. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably discouraged, he said he was beginning to wonder whether the early 
prognosis that he'd "be as good as new" would prove correct. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't worried about not being able to move adequately on stage, but was 
concerned that he may miss his chance to appear in director Oliver Stone's new 
movie about the Doors' Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
Idol had signed to play one of Morrison's friends in the film, but the shooting 
schedule couldn't wait for his leg to mend. Idol was delighted when Stone found 
another role for him, but the singer was worried that the April 18 operation 
might jeopardize that second chance. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Dimitriades, who manages Idol as well as Tom Petty and the rock group Yes, 
said the fifth operation went well. Idol, who was released from Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center last Sunday, is expected to be on crutches for "a couple of 
weeks," Dimitriades said, and then will be able to walk with a cane. He plans 
to start work on the film, titled "The Doors," in early May. 
</P>
<P>
If the film debut is an interesting career turn for the British-born rock star 
who first came to prominence with the punk band Generation X, the new "Charmed 
Life" album, which is due in the stores Tuesday, may represent a crucial turn 
in his recording career. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling that his music and image had become too one-dimensional, Idol tried to 
come up with a more personal album in 1989 with "Whiplash Smile." The album 
showed more emotional range, at least thematically, and it drew praise from 
once indifferent critics. 
</P>
<P>
While pleased with the advances, Idol was troubled by the emphasis in the album 
on drum machines and technology. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea of the album was to get more of an emotional side of me, not 
just the frustrated or angry side, but it was hard to do because of all the 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of it being the freewheeling music of 'Rebel Yell,' it was turning 
into something very stagnant or standard. So I wanted to get back on this album 
and tour to more of a real feel. . . . Real musicians playing the songs." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Idol started auditioning musicians for a new band shortly 
after he got to Los Angeles. The key challenge: a replacement for guitarist 
Steve Stevens, who broke from Idol after the "Whiplash Smile" tour to start his 
own band. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who co-wrote most of the songs on "Rebel Yell," was widely viewed as 
such a key part of Idol's success that some questions were raised about how 
well Idol could do on his own. 
</P>
<P>
The early critical reaction is favorable. Rolling Stone magazine gave the album 
four stars out of a possible five, declaring that the record indicates Idol is 
"no longer a casualty of fame but a rebel with a cause: self-preservation." 
(See review on Page 80.) 
</P>
<P>
Though Idol feels several songs in "Charmed Life" speak about various aspects 
of his own emotional struggles in recent years, he feels especially close to 
"Prodigal Blues." 
</P>
<P>
It's a look at the search for identity and ideals that begins: 
</P>
<P>
 Riding my life 
</P>
<P>
 Like a runaway train 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from one track to that 
</P>
<P>
 Howling, crying, screaming at the moon 
</P>
<P>
 Only my voice came back 
</P>
<P>
 Only the echo came back 
</P>
<P>
 "The song is about different elements of love," Idol said. "Obviously, seeing 
the birth of my son and watching him growing up made me think about myself and 
my father. It's also about security and breaking away, something we all have to 
go through. There comes that time when you have to break away to find out who 
you are or what you want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll was Idol's way of breaking away. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted to do anything else," he said. "To me, rock 'n' roll was a way 
the ordinary person could be creative and it wasn't like you had to be accepted 
by the real Establishment. That's what excited me the most, maybe. The rock 
stars seemed to be in control of their own destinies." 
</P>
<P>
But "Prodigal Blues" isn't just an expression of independence. It's also an 
expression of regret. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the traps of rock 'n' roll, or at least the traps of stardom, is that 
it makes you think you are superhuman. . . . The song is a reminder that you're 
just not perfect, really. I've probably let a lot of people down, one way or 
another. Sometimes you get pulled into situations where things don't work out. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I moved to California was that I was becoming isolated in 
New York: Never going out unless someone was driving me or a bodyguard was 
along. In California, I did away with all that. I got on my motorbike when I 
wanted to go somewhere. I didn't wait for a limousine. I started searching for 
the part of me that had gotten lost." 
</P>
<P>
Reaching for his crutches at the end of the interview, Idol added: "I just hope 
people will see that there is more to me than just a death trip. It'd be easy 
to just burn yourself out. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong, I still love a good party. But there's also a balance now. 
There's a side of me that loves life and that recognizes the importance of 
taking care of yourself and others. That's the one thing I regret about the 
motorcycle accident . . . that people might think it just reinforces the 
stereotype of the old Billy Idol."
