Master Gunnery Sgt. Juan Jose Valdez was the last Marine to board the last 
helicopter to leave the roof of the U.S. Embassy two hours before Saigon 
surrendered on April 30, 1975. He almost didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
"The chopper was just getting off the roof, and I stepped off and I slipped," 
said Valdez, now retired after 30 years in the Marine Corps and living in a 
peaceful neighborhood of this San Diego suburb. "And two guys I didn't know 
grabbed me and dragged me in." 
</P>
<P>
For Valdez, a gentle man who liked being in charge of embassy security, some of 
the memories are still painful. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to think about Saigon anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when he begins to speak, the memories come flooding back. In his garage, 
he finds photographs he had forgotten he had. Like an old newsreel, the roll of 
film begins with peaceful shots of the serene white embassy and Saigon 
landmarks in the relative peace of early 1975. Then there are shots taken from 
the rooftop on April 29 showing Vietnamese massing below and helicopters 
landing on the roof. Then a shot taken from inside the chopper, showing a 
shaken Valdez and 10 other Marines lifting off on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two big incinerators on the embassy roof," Valdez said. "We'd been 
burning material for almost a week and a half. We'd been burning tons and 
tons." 
</P>
<P>
The incinerators became so hot that the Marines had to stop them once and let 
them cool. "Otherwise they might have melted down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They had not planned to evacuate the embassy, but at 3:45 a.m., Communist 
shelling destroyed the main airstrip. All evacuation had to be by helicopter. 
Worse, the embassy roof could only support Sea Knight choppers, which could 
carry 20 people; the Sea Stallions could hold 40 to 50 people but were too 
heavy to land on the roof, Valdez said. As the crowd of Vietnamese outside the 
embassy grew larger and more frantic, the Marines brought in a platoon of 
reinforcements from the 7th Fleet. Valdez said they 
</P>
<P>
were completely unprepared to deal with panicky civilians trying to scale the 
embassy walls. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the Marines were stomping on the people's hands and everything and 
journalists were taking pictures, and it was giving the Marines a bad name," 
Valdez said. The infantrymen were quickly replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Officials did not dare open the embassy gates for fear they would be overrun. 
Valdez remembers lifting people over the gates. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, it was supposed to be only Americans and people from the 
other embassies, and other people who would have been in danger," Valdez said. 
"As things deteriorated, there were regular civilians mixed in." 
</P>
<P>
Valdez looked out at the crowd and realized that there would never be enough 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many messes of people. You knew that you could not possibly take 
them all." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Marines ran inside the embassy and slammed the magnetic doors. 
They ran up to the roof, locking doors on each floor, then waited. 
</P>
<P>
"From about 3 a.m. till almost 7 a.m., we sat there and waited with no 
communication," said Staff Sgt. Mike Sullivan, who was with Valdez on the last 
helicopter and now lives in San Juan Capistrano. Some of the Marines had never 
before set foot in Vietnam but were sent in to help with the evacuation, he 
said, and they were, by this time, beginning to worry that they would still be 
sitting on the roof when the Communist tanks arrived. "It got to be a little 
frightening," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Valdez: "To us it seemed like an eternity, but it was maybe two hours." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven Marines were supposed to be aboard the last helicopter, but Sullivan 
counted only 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed that John Valdez wasn't there," Sullivan said. "I looked at the back 
of the helicopter door, and I noticed two hands hanging there." Valdez had 
stayed behind, trying to make sure everyone was aboard; but the pilot was eager 
to leave. Sullivan helped pull Valdez into the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan is a financial aid adviser for National University now. Valdez is 
studying for a BA at San Diego State University and working for the U.S. Census 
Bureau. He was a platoon sergeant from 1965 to 1967 and saw combat in Da Nang 
and Chu Lai. Now 53, Valdez has a stack of medals but says it has been hard to 
find a good job since he left the Marines. He is sad but not bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look back on it now, it seems useless," Valdez said. "A lot of good 
people got killed, and for what? And when we left, we left with our tail 
between our legs." 
</P>
<P>
At the census office, Valdez now works with young Vietnamese-Americans. He 
bears them no ill will and says he considers them just another immigrant group. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hold any of it against the Vietnamese people," he said. "They probably 
didn't want the war any more than we did."

ASSEMBLY BID TO CONTROL BORDER AREA ANGERS SAN DIEGANS

<TEXT>
<P>
Mention the name of Assemblyman Richard Polanco to some of San Diego's civic 
leaders, and you get the kind of angry and suspicious reaction reserved for a 
carpet-bagger. 
</P>
<P>
Mention that attitude to Polanco, a low-profile Democrat from East Los Angeles, 
and you will hear the unflattering description of misguided locals who are too 
petty or too proud to admit they need help. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the emotional charges and counter-charges being thrown around in an 
escalating political struggle over who is going to control the destiny of 
development at the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco has introduced a bill that would use the power of state government to 
create a binational border authority to help pay for public projects, 
especially in debt-ridden Mexico. He says the new authority is needed to break 
the "petty" governmental deadlock that has allowed problems such as pollution, 
inadequate water lines and the lack of roads to stifle the economic promise of 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
But Polanco's good intentions have raised hackles among San Diego leaders, who 
argue that his portrayal of the problems is exaggerated. They openly resent the 
fact that Polanco failed to consult with them first, as well as his insistence 
on pushing the binational bonding authority in Sacramento against their wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think San Diego deserves to be treated in what is a condescending 
manner," said Bernice Layton, vice president of international affairs for the 
Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to think that we would not be surprised and taken aback when 
someone comes down and plunks something down that has nothing to do with San 
Diego and its structure," she said. "No alternatives have been explored, except 
superimposing an agency that would not be accountable to the region." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) said the reaction to Polanco's designs on the 
border are similar to the emotional local opposition engendered by the proposed 
merger between Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
"It's touched the same nerve that the merger touched," said Killea, who lived 
in Mexico for 15 years while her husband was U.S. consul general to Monterrey 
and Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like, 'We're in charge of our own existence and don't you tell us 
how to do it!' We look upon the border as San Diego's domain. In that sense, 
it's kind of a proprietary air, a territorial attitude." 
</P>
<P>
So stirred up are the San Diegans that, during a Chamber of Commerce excursion 
to Sacramento last month, a handful of business leaders fanned out in the 
Capitol to lobby against the Polanco measure. The foray came just three months 
after several San Diego officials spoke out against the proposed agency at a 
public hearing Polanco held in San Diego last December. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco said that, besides political considerations, he suspects some of San 
Diego's resistance is rooted in back-handed racism. 
</P>
<P>
"I have given thought as to whether or not there are racial overtones, in the 
sense that I, being a Hispanic legislator, am coming into an area . . . that 
has problems being contributed to by the Mexican government," he said. "Here, I 
bring a solution, because I think that's what I should be about, and all of a 
sudden the resistance curtain is being raised." 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber's Layton said Polanco's charges of racism are wrong. "To hear we 
don't want anything to do with Mexico is absurd, when this community has a lot 
of programs to connect us to Mexico," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco's bill is actually one of two introduced in the Legislature to create a 
quasi-governmental body to take over the task of building roads, sewers, water 
pipes, telecommunications systems and other public improvements along the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The need for such public infrastructure has been underscored by the heady 
growth of the maquiladora industry. Maquiladora plants use cheap Mexican labor 
for the assembly and manufacture of goods later sold in the United States or 
abroad. The goods made in Mexico are brought over to San Diego County at a 
minimal tariff before being shipped elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are an estimated 1,100 maquiladora plants employing more than 
335,000 Mexican workers. About 600 of the plants are in Tijuana, and 40% of 
those require matching warehouse, distribution or other facilities in San 
Diego, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Some maquiladora backers say the industry is an important component of a border 
and regional economy. They assert that 40% to 60% of the wages earned by 
maquiladora workers are spent in the United States, and that the companies 
themselves spend tens of millions in San Diego alone for supplies, taxes and 
equipment repairs linked directly to their Tijuana plants. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego is not alone in benefitting from the healthy border economy, says 
Polanco. The economy is so strong there it sends ripples throughout Southern 
California and the state, he said. Making sure it stays that way is not the 
responsibility or domain of anyone group of leaders or community, Polanco 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the way of even greater economic prosperity, some say, is a welter 
of nuts-and-bolts problems. Jammed border crossings, the dumping of toxic 
waste, inadequate surface streets, the lack of housing for Mexican workers, an 
unreliable telephone system just aren't good for business, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Even businessmen who usually don't have a lot of concern about these topics 
are now very worried that there is such a lack of infrastructure -- not only 
phones and roads, but housing for the workers -- and it affects the maquiladora 
business," said Gabriel Szekley, acting director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican 
Studies at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, those problems have fallen on a patchwork of governmental 
jurisdictions, which must try to overcome the differences of international 
styles and priorities to forge a binational solution. Szekley said that even 
the binational commissions that have been formed to bridge these cultural gaps 
have failed to cope. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not matter that they may have the authority," he said. "They have not 
been doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Polanco added: "One city will say this, another city will say, 'No, that's not 
my priority.' You have one economic development strategy coming from one group, 
and another strategy coming from another, and nothing happens." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the underground frustration over the deadlock reached more than 500 
miles north to Sacramento, where the Legislature made some surprise moves to 
take the problems from local officials in San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a bill introduced by Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) in March, 1989, to 
establish a border bonding authority that could impose taxes, set tolls and use 
condemnation powers to supersede local governmental decisions on both sides of 
the border. There was talk of building a monorail, worker housing or a private 
border crossing, where tolls would be charged. 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, the backers of the bill were two young Orange County residents 
-- a stockbroker and an attorney -- who had formed something called the CABEZA 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the development of business 
along the border. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our view that these problems have existed, and you don't need another 
$3 million study to study the problem," said the attorney, Doug Davidson of 
Irvine. "Anybody who is reasonably acquainted with the border could come up 
with 15 to 20 of these projects, but the problem is coming up with the dough to 
take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
Yet persistent inquiries about the CABEZA Foundation failed to satisfy 
suspicions among the San Diegans that there was something behind the Orange 
County interest in their turf. Were Davidson and his partner, stockbroker Sam 
Palmer IV, fronting for out-of-town businessmen with designs on the border? Did 
the two have hidden land interests along the border? Did Palmer hope to make 
money himself by selling the bonds issued by the new border authority? 
</P>
<P>
Davidson and Palmer say there is nothing behind their proposal beside altruism. 
Yet the nagging questions about the mysterious origins of the bill, along with 
provisions giving the foundation a measure of control over the new bonding 
agency, raised enough eyebrows and howls of protest from San Diegans that a 
frustrated Maddy has allowed his bill to go dormant for now. 
</P>
<P>
However, some of that same suspicion has now washed over to Polanco, who 
continues to push a nearly identical proposal introduced in November on the 
Assembly side of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker says his measure wasn't inspired by the CABEZA Foundation, but 
CABEZA's Palmer said this week that he is working closely with the Los Angeles 
Democrat to come up with amendments and keep the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working together," said Palmer. "We don't care that we get it through 
the Assembly first or the Senate first." 
</P>
<P>
Polanco and his staff acknowledge that they are consulting with CABEZA, but say 
his interest in the border was originally piqued by a tour of Mexico's economic 
and industrial plants last year. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, the Polanco proposal would create a bonding authority run by 
seven directors -- three of them appointed from Mexico and four from 
California. The directors would be political appointments, but only one would 
be from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. Amendments now under 
consideration would expand the board to nine members, adding one seat from the 
city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The authority would be restricted to issuing revenue bonds, debt secured and 
retired by the money taken in from the special projects being built. It could 
also charge fees and assessments, but it would not have the power of eminent 
domain -- a sore point in the Maddy bill. Charged with respecting local plans, 
the authority would also be charged with coordinating efforts at all levels of 
U.S. and Mexican government that have a hand in the border. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these modifications, many San Diego officials remain stridently opposed 
to the Polanco measure, although a few academics like Szekley say it has 
generated useful debate on how to promote binational and regional solutions to 
the border problems. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that it treads in the area of foreign policy; it adds a layer of 
unaccountable government; it may disturb the delicate border economy with the 
imposition of additional fees and assessments; it is designed only to help the 
narrow business interests of maquiladora investors. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diegan's bottom-line argument, though, is that Polanco's proposal is 
simply unnecessary. The problems are either greatly exaggerated or on the brink 
of being solved after years of persistent effort through existing governmental 
channels, they say. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there are the nascent plans to build a $130-million to 
$200-million sewage treatment plant along the border to catch and neutralize 
the constant flow of effluent spilling out of Tijuana's antiquated sewers and 
into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
After years of jawboning, the federal government is considering a $15.7-million 
budget request to begin planning the plant. And, at the urging of Assemblyman 
Steve Peace (D-La Mesa), state leaders have agreed to allow at least a 
$20-million slice from the next bond package to help pay for the Tijuana plant, 
as well as a proposed facility to treat the New River flowing out of Mexicali 
and into the Salton Sea. 
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. Customs Service is planning a third border crossing in San Diego 
County to alleviate the long waits at the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa checkpoints, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
Those developments make Polanco's proposal "a solution in search of a problem," 
said Dan Pegg, president of the San Diego Economic Development Corp. and last 
year's chairman of the Border Trade Alliance. "Somebody stands to benefit from 
it somewhere because they are working so hard against staunch resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a whole lot of players from Orange County and other places whose 
interests really don't lie within the region, interjecting themselves into the 
local planning processes and fee structures, which are already very sensitive 
and fragile," said Pegg. "Here you have an (authority) that can suddenly levy 
tolls and fees . . . that will take us out of the market." 
</P>
<P>
Other business leaders ask: Why doesn't Polanco turn his attention to some of 
the problems plaguing his own district of East Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
"People here did not plead with him and say, 'God, you've got to help us do 
something!' " said Layton. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those objections, Polanco says he will hold a hearing in early May to 
ask for votes to move his proposal along. The idea, he said, was received with 
some interest when he presented it to Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari at a meeting in Los Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco describes San Diego's tolerance of the border problems as a variation 
on the old maxim on how the city works: If it doesn't happen north of 
Interstate 8, it's not important. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of it has to do with the traditional way of things getting done 
in San Diego," said Polanco. "If it's not north of a designated area, then, 
hey, it's not going to happen. If it is, then there's a lot of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"I have met a lot of people, and I have presented this to many people," Polanco 
said. "It isn't like I've come and imposed myself on them. And, even if I did, 
I have an obligation as an elected representative to bring about remedies to 
problems of concern. 
</P>
<P>
"So they ought to get off the dime and do away with their pettiness."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: AND NOW, A WORD FROM OUR CENSORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In keeping with my preference for offensive, tasteless and derogatory material, 
I now present The Adver- tisement They Didn't Want You to See. 
</P>
<P>
It was an ad for Select-a-Car, a San Diego-based service that promises to take 
the haggle out of buying a new car by acting as your surrogate shopper/ 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
The ad showed a woebegone sap trapped in a cell. 
</P>
<P>
The caption: 
</P>
<P>
"In Some Countries Putting People in Little Rooms for a Long Time Is Called 
Torture. In America We Call It Buying a Car." 
</P>
<P>
Ad executive Neal Melden thought his creation was downright clever. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to buy space in several newspapers, all of which have taken other 
Select-a-Car ads. 
</P>
<P>
This one proved to be an ad too far. 
</P>
<P>
"We rejected it because, personally, I found it offensive," said Ira Rosenthal, 
classified advertising manager for the North County Blade-Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
"We rejected it on the basis that it is tasteless," said Gerry Wilson, director 
of marketing for the San Diego Union-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
He said it seems to smack of poking fun at the hostages in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
(The U-T ran the ad for one day by mistake.) 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times rejected the ad because of the newspaper's code banning 
ads with "derogatory statements which attack or slur any company, line of work 
or individual." 
</P>
<P>
Also joining the rejection chorus: the Riverside Press-Enterprise, the 
Escondido Times Advocate and the Temecula Californian. 
</P>
<P>
Melden sensed the hot breath of the auto dealers association, prime buyers of 
newspaper advertising space. Not so, said the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Melden has decided to redesign the ad. 
</P>
<P>
But he's still puzzled over hitting a solid wall of newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
"I had asked that the ad be in the A section, near all the stories about rape, 
incest, AIDS, murder and mayhem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ad must have been pretty bad not to be able to be printed alongside that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She's Been There 
</P>
<P>
Evelyne Hall-Adams, 80, a retired recreation supervisor living in an Oceanside 
mobile home park, will be attending a Republican Party gala for high rollers 
this week in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans sent her complimentary plane tickets and hotel reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The event is the spring meeting of the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Two days of insider briefings and a party with President and Mrs. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Invited are people who have given $1,000 or more to the party, plus a few 
honored guests such as Hall-Adams. Republicans figure that several races this 
fall are going to be close. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Hall-Adams comes in. She's an expert on close races. 
</P>
<P>
She and Babe Didrikson finished in an apparent dead heat in the 80-meter 
hurdles in the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The time: a world record 11.7 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
In a disputed decision, judges gave the Gold Medal to Didrikson, the Silver to 
Hall-Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Hall-Adams later turned pro and in 1988 was inducted into the Track Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
She'll be among 3 dozen sports Hall of Famers invited to the Republican bash. 
Another: former Charger Coach Sid Gillman. 
</P>
<P>
Hall-Adams doesn't run much anymore, but the competitive spirit is undimmed. 
</P>
<P>
She feels she was robbed in '32, and that she and Babe should have shared the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did I Say That? 
</P>
<P>
It says here. 
</P>
<P>
* Former San Diego Councilman Mike Gotch, running for Assembly, is using an old 
quote from Pete Wilson in his campaign literature: "Mike, working with you has 
been a great pleasure for me . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Right, such a pleasure that in his latter years as mayor, Wilson put Gotch in 
political deep freeze and broke with council tradition to deny him a committee 
chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
* Law, language and lucre. 
</P>
<P>
Warning in the felony arraignment division of San Diego Superior Court:"Front 
row reserved for attorneys, translators and revenue recovery." 
</P>

* North County bumper sticker: "Free Tibet."

CHUMASH INDIANS URGE NAME FOR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Chumash Indians meeting Sunday night voted to recommend that a 
proposed new wilderness area in north Ventura County be named the Chumash 
Wilderness Area. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Tumamait, who organized the meeting, attended by about 40 people, said 
he prefers the name Chumash over other suggestions because it would increase 
the tribe's visibility. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the Washington School auditorium in Ventura, was called to 
recommend a Chumash name for the wilderness, which includes a number of sites 
with historical or spiritual significance to the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) said last week that he would seek to get 
the name chosen by the Chumash approved if the wilderness bill, now stalled in 
the Senate, passes.

<P>
Huddled together, trying to keep their balance on the slippery stones, six 
children, eight adults and their instructor scanned the water and rocks around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"There he goes! See him? See him? He just ran under the big rock," yelled 
5-year-old Todd Renstrom of Ventura. Wearing a baseball cap illustrated with 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Todd stood transfixed by a less glamorous sea 
creature -- a crab. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" he yelled, pointing as the crab skirted sideways through the rocks. 
"Awesome!" 
</P>
<P>
Todd was one of the participants in a tide pool expedition Sunday sponsored by 
the Ventura Department of Parks and Recreation. The event allowed participants 
to explore oceanside rocks at low tide while listening to a lecture on the 
animal and plant life found there. 
</P>
<P>
"Crabs are usually the high point," instructor Duncan Young said. "Kids like 
anything that moves." 
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's excursion at Faria County Park, the sea slug came in a close 
second to the crab. Chris Rose described the slug he saw as "big, big, big, and 
spotted and slimy." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the slug didn't whet Chris' appetite for seafood. In fact, he 
said he'd rather eat peas. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris would rather die than eat peas, so that's a pretty strong statement," 
said his mother, Kathy Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the adults seemed tense balancing themselves on the slippery rocks. But 
the youngsters jumped from one to the next, fearlessly peering into crevices 
and collecting shells. Lindsey Grives, 6, saw a sea anemone and reached out to 
touch it. "Ooh, it's slimy," she said, wrinkling her nose. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he is accustomed to such reactions. "Girls, especially when they're 
about fifth-grade age, are the perennial screamers," he said. "And sixth-grade 
boys always wind up getting wet. They go as close to the ocean as possible and 
inevitably get wiped out by a wave." 
</P>
<P>
Young continually cautioned the children to watch where they were stepping to 
avoid hurting marine life. At the end of the excursion, he reminded the 
children to return all but one of the shells they collected back into the 
water. Not only does the rule help preserve the environment, but some of the 
shells serve as hosts to other animals such as sand crabs, he said, "and we 
don't want to hurt anything." 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters got to keep one shell as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Rose said she considers tide-pooling a great natural baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take them to a less rocky beach like Carpinteria, and not worry about 
letting them run around. And they'll entertain themselves for hours. Plus they 
learn a lot in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Other outdoor family activities offered this spring through the recreation 
department include a spring skywatch Thursday, during which an astronomer, with 
the help of a powerful telescope, will teach participants about constellations 
and other heavenly bodies. 
</P>
<P>
On May 9 and June 8, there will be a hike through Seaside Park under the full 
moon. For information, call 658-4726. MAJA RADEVICH

DAMAGE IN GARAGE FIRE SET AT $60,000

<P>
A garage fire caused an estimated $60,000 in damage in Simi Valley, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started in the garage at 2772 Harrington Road at 7:10 p.m. Saturday 
and was under control at 7:39, said Vicki Crabtree, a Ventura County Fire 
Department dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the fire is being investigated, Crabtree said. Damage was estimated at 
$30,000 to the structure and $30,000 to its contents, including a Volkswagen 
van and a tractor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported.

INTERCHANGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest and indeed, some amusement, the article which ran April 17 
concerning the Mulholland/Valley Circle Interchange. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, in its dying gasp, still does not see the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of all government operations, they say, "If we had the money, we would 
go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Nelson, Caltrans' project design director, chooses to ignore the fact that 
the four homeowners' groups and the Leonis Adobe Assn. were, as the article 
stated, "annoyed" by the proposed interchange plan and demanded an 
environmental impact report on this project. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Nelson chose to ignore the community's feelings about this plan 
resulted in the pending lawsuits and was the determining factor behind 
Caltrans' decision to drop this project. Nelson should realize that community 
sentiment is the voice of the voters. It is that "voice" that will provide 
Caltrans with the funds it seeks. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, we have Hunt Braly, a representative of state Sen. Ed Davis, 
and his statement, "If people next time don't support the preferred 
alternative, it will be very difficult to keep Caltrans involved in the 
project." Braly goes on to add to this already ridiculous statement: "We need a 
renewed commitment from the citizens to work for an improved interchange." 
</P>
<P>
These statements, one from an official at Caltrans and one from a 
representative of a state senator, prompt one question: Has there ever been any 
consideration given to what the people think about this project? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to that question is an obvious and resounding "No!"

REIN IN WESTLAKE NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We the people. . .don't seem to get any choices anymore. Or any of that other 
stuff that free speech and the will of the majority was all about. 
</P>
<P>
So many of us are giving up and giving in to political contributors. This 
letter is my own last attempt to speak out, in despair, to ask other people to 
rally, because, even in the Soviet Union these days, when people really care, 
things seem to be movable. At least over there. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening over here to our last bit of fresh air, and space, over in 
Westlake North and other developments? What happened to all those people who 
spoke up and signed and said, "Not another shopping mall! No more pollution! We 
value our open spaces! Stop!" 
</P>
<P>
All these people were stopped because a heavy form was not attached to a 
petition form. Obviously, the people who value breathing space didn't know that 
if you value open space, and the right to rule your own destiny, and not turn 
our valuable real estate into another congested "Valley," you have to gather, 
not signatures, but dollars, and put them in the right pockets. 
</P>
<P>
I call on everyone who cares to write and call the Westlake city fathers to 
stop the huge project planned at Westlake North before it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, give them a chance to prove me wrong -- show that they are leaders of 
people who care, not of pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe I should be asking you to gather dollars.

WARNER RIDGE 'EYESORE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article (April 23) regarding the "Warner Ridge Debate" leads me to applaud 
this paper and all media in general for exposing the corruption that exists in 
government and elsewhere. It amazes me that Joy Picus would state such a 
bold-face lie that the lawsuit is "about developers who didn't get everything 
they wanted through the city's planning process, the same fair and open process 
that everybody else has to go through." 
</P>
<P>
This "shoot from the hip" comment is the best example of the half-truths that 
one has come to expect from Picus during her years in office. The fact is that 
Spound Co. and Johnson Wax have earned approvals from every city and state 
agency during the five years of public hearings, since the inception of the 
project. This includes the city Planning Commission, the Citizens Advisory 
Committee, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
This project was disapproved at the City Council level without any background 
evidence, ignoring the recommendations of their experts such as city planners, 
engineers, attorneys, as well as a good percentage of the general public who 
live in the area and who supported the project after years of attending public 
hearings and listening to the proposals put forward by the developers. 
</P>
<P>
Now the taxpayers must pay for this by the lost dollars in property and 
licensing taxes, as well as the cost of defending a $100-million lawsuit and 
the exposure of a $100-million-plus judgment which they will ultimately have to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
This valuable, undeveloped piece of land will remain an eyesore as long as our 
politicians oppose worthwhile projects purely for political reasons and do not 
act in the best interest of the public.

ABANDONED CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the April 14 article on the abandoned children, "Cast-Off Babies on 
the Rise in the County," why is the Department Children's Services spending any 
of its valuable time looking for people who don't want their children and who 
have made that quite clear? Go look for some good adoptive parents, and 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Running cute little mug shots of these waifs and pleading for their mothers to 
reconsider reminds me more of a Hollywood movie of the 1930s than the reality 
of Los Angeles in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking about poor but impeccably dressed Constance Bennett leaving 
her beloved child with nuns at the convent. We're talking about abuse, drugs, 
poverty, foster homes and, possibly, death at an early age. We're talking about 
leaving kids in dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to get worse. It's time to sever parental rights and save these 
kids.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "Nonprofit Housing: A Rich Idea," April 2: 
</P>
<P>
As a nonprofit housing developer of emergency shelter, transitional housing and 
permanent housing, I applaud your editorial. I have personally been involved 
with nonprofit housing for 15 years and as an architect I started L.A. Family 
Housing Corp. seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Your article discussing building on city-owned land and the speeding up of the 
bureaucracy are all vital pieces that need to be accomplished if we are ever to 
solve the problem of homelessness and the lack of affordable housing. Please 
continue to write about this issue and maybe some day homelessness and the lack 
of affordable housing will be a part of our shameful past.

I am pleased (but saddened) to have validated by this article the many thoughts 
I hold regarding the future of this country and Washington's ease at ignoring 
them. 
</P>
<P>
What can the ordinary citizen do? I volunteer my time trying to help solve 
local issues, but these do not reflect the serious lack of leadership (in both 
parties) on the national level. 
</P>
<P>
It seems apparent that our chosen leaders are so weakened by the desire to 
remain in office that they are powerless to act on critical issues facing this 
country and the world.

What a relief it was to see The Times give front-page treatment to Nelson's 
analysis of the major problem facing our nation -- preparing for the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
For years we have witnessed the deterioration of the systems which provide 
sustenance and support for the children of this nation, namely, education and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the Nelson article is the first installment of a campaign to arouse 
public demand for a national education system which prepares students for the 
next century, and a national health care system which provides the care 
essential for their survival and success.

Milt Swimmer, partner with J.H. Snyder Co., is to be commended for his attitude 
towards the pair of peregrine falcons mating on his building ("Love on a 
Ledge," Metro, April 26). By treating the birds as his "first tenants," Swimmer 
breaks important ground in the battle of developers vs. nature. I hope his 
placing the needs of two raptors before those of efficient construction sends a 
signal to other developers to examine their own priorities.

SHIRER'S CBS RADIO SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J.F. Beck's letter (March 19) concerning the chapters in my book, "A Native's 
Return," about Edward R. Murrow and his firing me from CBS makes some 
astonishing statements. 
</P>
<P>
He speaks of my "claim to martyrdom." I never claimed it. The charge is false. 
</P>
<P>
He asserts that when he was in the news department at the Los Angeles CBS radio 
station he had to listen to "complaints from the sales department about the 
declining quality of the ratings in Shirer's time period." 
</P>
<P>
What complaints? The local Los Angeles CBS station's salesmen had nothing to do 
with selling my Sunday show, the only sponsored one I had. This was handled by 
the New York CBS office and a New York advertising agency which bought time for 
the sponsor for a coast-to-coast hookup. There were never any "complaints" from 
the sales people in New York. Why? 
</P>
<P>
Because, I suppose, contrary to what Beck contends about declining ratings, and 
to his bland assurance that I "could no longer command a broadcasting audience 
large enough for the requirements of broadcast commerce," my Sunday broadcast, 
according to the reports I got weekly from MCA, my agent, had the highest 
rating of any daytime show on Sunday. If my ratings were slipping, as Beck 
asserts, surely the sponsor, not to mention Murrow and William Paley, would 
have complained. They never did. 
</P>
<P>
Beck says that "my lack of broadcast skills, voice quality and delivery" had 
made me "dull beyond survival" on the air. However, at the very moment in 1947 
that the controversy erupted, I was receiving the Peabody Award, then the most

cited me "as the most interesting news commentator on the air."

It is embarrassing to mention such things, but Beck's letter, full of

A 29-year-old man was slain in an argument among a group of men at a woman's El 
Cajon apartment, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man, identified as Marcos Edward Hernandez of San Diego, was shot once 
in the chest shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday outside the apartment in the 900 
block of East Washington Avenue, El Cajon police said. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Edward Johnson, 50, of the 3500 block of Dorchester Drive in San Diego

According to El Cajon police Lt. Robert Lein, the victim was a friend of the 
new boyfriend of the woman, identified as Tina Collins. He and the unidentified 
boyfriend were visiting with her at the apartment when Johnson and his son, 
Joel Martin Johnson, arrived, police said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police officer shot and wounded an armed theft suspect after officers 
confronted a group of prowling inside a tow yard, police reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Coy Donald Thomas, a 25-year-old construction worker, was listed in 
fair condition Sunday at UC San Diego Medical Center, where a nursing 
supervisor said he was being treated for gunshot wounds to the abdomen and 
thigh. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Thomas, whose address was unknown, was one of three men found in 
and around the grounds of the South Bay Towing yard in the 600 block of K 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dean Girdner gave this account of the shooting, which occurred shortly 
after 11:30 p.m. Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
Officers were dispatched to the tow yard by witnesses who reported that two men 
were "going through vehicles." David Eugene Higgins, 20, address unknown, was 
arrested without incident inside the yard. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, however, jumped a fence and ran, with Officer Martin Brady giving chase 
on foot. Repeated shouts to stop went unanswered for several blocks, and the 
two eventually came to the side of a residence in the 700 block of Jefferson 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The officer confronted him from 15 to 20 feet and ordered him to freeze and 
stop. Thomas turned and faced the officer in a dark, narrow area on the north 
side of the garage and put his hands in the front waistband of his pants. 
Thomas then raised his right hand and appeared to throw a knife at Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Brady fired several rounds at Thomas, who fell to the ground. When officers 
attempted to check his condition, Thomas struggled to his feet, climbed over 
another fence and ran another block. He was arrested there, where a knife was 
found in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Thomas was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, 
possession of an illegal knife and theft. Higgins was booked on suspicion of 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
Carl R. Smith, 19, was detained by police after he was found sleeping in a 
vehicle near the scene, but was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, 27, has been a Chula Vista police officer for four years.

Steve Weinberg, author of "Armand Hammer: The Untold Story," says he tries not 
to think about the defamation suit that the Occidental Petroleum chairman filed 
against him in London. "It ruins my day," Weinberg said at a recent journalism 
seminar in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
However, Weinberg, who is executive director of Investigative Reporters &amp; 
Editors, didn't seem worried about defending his work. He asserts that Hammer, 
who had lawyers and other representatives working overtime in an attempt to 
keep the book from being published, filed suit in England because of the 
country's less permissive libel law. 
</P>
<P>
"I have thousands of pages of documents. I have his income tax returns for 
several years. I have his high school report card from 1916. I have records of 
all the pieces of property he owns. I have his congressional testimony from the 
1930s. I have details of 50 lawsuits (involving Hammer and his businesses) and 
information from another 250 minor lawsuits. I have the complete file of his 
two divorces," Weinberg said.

New Firm, Old Symbol 
</P>
<P>
The new logo for Time Warner Inc. may look made for the 1990s, but it also 
contains hints of symbols dating back thousands of years. As is its corporate 
creator, the new logo is the result of a merger. A stylized eye and ear have 
been used to represent, as the company describes it, the appeal of Time 
Warner's products to those senses. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't take a mythology expert to see similarities in the new logo to 
the symbols of earlier times. The sign of Horus, the ancient Egyptian 
falcon-headed god, also used a stylized eye with a spiral. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no attempt to connect with something ancient," said Steff 
Geissbuhler, partner in the New York design firm Chermayeff &amp; Geismar, 
which created the new logo. "But every time you use an icon such as an eye or 
ear you echo ancient themes." And, in a way, Horus was in the communications 
business too. Four thousand years ago, the eyes of Horus were sometimes painted 
on the outside of coffins in the belief that they would help the dead to see in 
the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hidden Value in Stock 
</P>
<P>
The way one analyst sees it, Safeway Inc.'s 35% stake in El Monte-based Vons 
Cos. boosted by a hefty amount what investors were willing to pay for Safeway 
shares in the Oakland company's initial public offering last week. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how Suzanne McGrath of the Black &amp; Co. investment firm in Portland, 
Ore., figures it: Safeway owns about 13.6 million shares of Vons, which is 
trading at about $23 a share. That yields a stake in Vons of nearly $313 
million. 
</P>
<P>
On a fully diluted basis -- taking into account management stock options and 
the exercise of warrants -- Safeway would have about 100 million common shares. 
The Vons holding, therefore, contributed $3.13 to the value of each Safeway 
share, so that investors who subscribed to the offering at $11.25 really paid 
only $8.125 for Safeway.

Producer to Cut Agents' Cuts: Producer Cameron Mackintosh, who made Broadway 
history by charging $100 for top seats to next season's "Miss Saigon," is 
causing more woes among New York theater ticket agents. Mackintosh, who also 
produced "Les Miserables" and "Phantom of the Opera," has told the agents, who 
sell millions of dollars of tickets in advance block ticket sales, that 
"Saigon" will not pay the flat 10% commission that has long been standard 
industry practice. His new flexible commission scale will range from 5% for the 
best seats to 10% on the hardest-to-unload. GREG BRAXTON

Beach Boys Movie Sued: Irving Music Co. has sued a film production company, 
accusing them of lying to win permission to use Beach Boys songs in an ABC 
television movie based on an unauthorized biography of the surf-music group. 
The Los Angeles Superior Court suit alleges Leonard Hill Productions told 
Irving agents that they wanted to use the songs for a "teen-age coming-of-age 
story" or in a film about "vacationing kids who liked Beach Boys music." The 
ABC film, "The Story of the Beach Boys: Summer Dreams" aired Sunday. GREG

Brunnhilde Hit by Falling Scenery: Soprano Hildegard Behrens was struck on her 
face and chest by falling scenery during Wagner's "Die Gotterdammerung" at the 
Metropolitan Opera Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Behrens was later released from Roosevelt Hospital after being treated for 
several bruises. The soprano stumbled at the end of the immolation scene and 
was hit by a column of cork that signified the collapse of a palace. It was not 
known if Behrens would be able to participate in her next scheduled performance 
of "Die Walkure" Tuesday. Also in doubt is continuation of the filming for 
television of the "Ring" cycle for Deutsche Grammophon. GREG BRAXTON

"THE CONDUCTOR"(France-Belgium, 1989; Director: Marion Hansel. Century Plaza 2, 
7 p.m.) Exquisitely wrought meditation on the nature of identity, involving 
guilt and responsibility, with a classical music background. The acting is 
wonderful: including Malcolm McDowell's best performance in years. As in many 
international co-productions, though, the mix of nationalities may unsettle 
some audiences. (Kevin Thomas).

OAKLAND BALLET RECONSTRUCTS 'LE TRAIN BLEU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great secret of the Oakland Ballet's newly reconstructed "Le Train Bleu" is 
immediacy. The setting by sculptor Henri Laurens may slice an ordinary beach 
landscape into exotic Cubist planes and angles, but we instantly recognize it 
and its inhabitants: sleek bathing beauties in designer swimwear (by Coco 
Chanel, no less) and hot musclemen on the make. If we connect with this 
long-lost 1924 "operette dansee" through our own direct observation and 
experience, so do the dancers. "Train Bleu" may be a fabled relic of Serge 
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but it's also the ancestor of every surf frolic 
from "The Boy Friend" to "Beach Blanket Bingo." These young Californians 
understand it perfectly. Cast as seaside "poules" and "gigolos," they revel in 
the witty mock athleticism of Bronislava Nijinska's choreography, along with 
the preening narcissism that she so inventively filters through classical 
style. 
</P>
<P>
The pantomimic sexual byplay devised by Jean Cocteau also seems second nature 
to them -- and that's crucial, because "Train Bleu" is very much concerned with 
people selling themselves to one another. Sometimes the score by Darius Milhaud 
becomes an ironic comment on this lust-and-sand milieu -- rather like 
Nijinska's pointed references to "Giselle" and "The Sleeping Beauty" -- but 
elsewhere the use of familiar '20s idioms makes it sound like pop records 
playing in nearby hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Although both Irina Nijinska (the choreographer's daughter) and Frank W. D. 
Ries (a Cocteau specialist) had to rely on guesswork as well as scholarship in 
assembling their reconstruction, "Le Train Bleu" always feels fully alive in 
the present tense. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this insistently trivial and topical collaboration -- which also 
originally enlisted the contributions of Pablo Picasso and Anton Dolin -- seems 
infinitely closer to us than any of the dance masterworks created by Nijinska 
or her brother, Vaslav Nijinsky. As the irresistible "Beau Gosse" (Dolin's 
character), Michael Lowe can't smoothly switch between mime, gymnastics and 
classical bravura, so the role looks imposed on him rather than a 
custom-tailored tour de force. But Abra Rudisill makes every seductive flapper 
mannerism newly incendiary as "Perlouse" (originally danced by Lydia Sokolova), 
a portrayal exactly on target. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill also gives a valiant but muted performance as Caroline in the 
company's valiant but muted production of "Jardin aux Lilas," with Lowe, again, 
cast as her lover. 
</P>
<P>
This Sallie Wilson staging of Antony Tudor's 1936 classic settles for clarity 
when it needs much more richness of interpretation -- especially in gestural 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
Agnes de Mille's aptly titled "Inconsequentials" represents a kind of notebook: 
miscellaneous ballet lore and ironic commentary collected over the years and 
arranged in 1983 (after two previous versions) to a selection of Schubert piano 
and vocal music. The piece presents itself as a cheery, pseudo-folk 
divertissement in elegant classical style, but along the way there are 
unexpectedly trenchant observations about fatuous male virtuosi, the rhetoric 
of dance-drama and the role of women in ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us would rather hear De Mille speak on these subjects than watch them 
season a dirndl-and-lederhosen charade. But everything De Mille choreographs is 
worth the most careful attention, and "Inconsequentials" does offer more 
opportunities to admire Rudisill, and to become acquainted with such Oakland 
paragons as Elizabeth Ashton and Joral Schmalle. Taped music accompanied all 
three ballets -- with the unsteady (and uncredited) singing in 
"Inconsequentials" and the plodding tempos in "Jardin aux Lilas" working 
against the best interests of the company.

The narrative device is slightly absurd, but, back in 1971, this film's

should. Part of the David Wolper Tribute. (Michael Wilmington)

'WILD ORCHID' MAKES ITS SEX SEEM LUDICROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is is possible to create a big, glossy sex fantasy that is so silly, it gives 
sex a bad name? 
</P>
<P>
"Wild Orchid" (citywide), asks us to believe that star and debuting actress 
Carre Otis -- the model from the Guess jeans ads -- is a specialist in 
international law, hired on sight and whisked off to Rio de Janiero for a 
complex business deal that seems to involve sex with most of the principals. 
</P>
<P>
It asks us to believe that Mickey Rourke -- sporting a wardrobe that consists 
mostly of black sports coat over bare chest, one gold earring and numerous 
layers of dark pancake makeup -- is an international entrepreneur trying to 
overcome a deprived youth as the stuttering child of Pittsburgh proles. It asks 
us to believe that Jacqueline Bisset, as Claudia, takes business calls while 
dancing the frug and has tremendous difficulties getting Rourke into bed. It 
asks us to believe. . . . Well, why go on? 
</P>
<P>
This movie makes sexual adventurism seems so ludicrous, that it might have been 
made by Puritans in disguise, trying to portray hedonists as a pack of 
fatheads. Director-writer Zalman King, who along with collaborator-wife 
Patricia Louisiana Knop, also wrote "8 1/2 Weeks" for Adrian Lyne, is obviously 
trying for something lusciously steamy and seamy. But he doesn't have 
swank-master Lyne's high-gloss, back-lit, dry-ice skills. The movie is like a 
piece of hard-core pornography in which most of the sex scenes have been 
removed, softened or turned into perfume commercials -- and in which only the 
dopey connecting expository scenes are left. 
</P>
<P>
King tries not to miss a trick. To show that his characters are involved in 
artifice and deceit, he has them put on fancy masks. To show that they should 
be having a good time but aren't, he sets the movie during carnival time. To 
show that he's a feminist at heart, he has Bisset and Otis dress up as men. To 
show that he hasn't forgotten audiences, he has the blouse or top ripped off 
nearly every actress in the film, except Bisset, who does her bit in a dry 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
To show he reads the newspaper he throws in the lambada, and to show he watches 
art films he casts Assumpta Serna, from "Matador." She plays the role of her 
career: a frigid wife who gets cured after a drunken sailor tears her top off. 
</P>
<P>
If "Wild Orchid" (MPAA rated R for sex and language) were a little bit sillier, 
it might classify as a minor classic of howling camp. As it is, the movie is 
pseudo-swanky, chic and sappy.

2 RALLIES AIM AT PROBLEMS OF HOMELESSNESS; 
</P>
<P>
STREET PEOPLE: ONE SEEKS TO REGISTER SKID ROW HABITUES TO VOTE. IN SANTA 
MONICA, RESIDENTS EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT CRIME LINKED TO TRANSIENTS.

<P>
Two rallies concerning the homeless of the Los Angeles area were held Sunday -- 
one sponsored by people aiming to help street people re-enter the mainstream, 
the other by beach community residents concerned about violence linked to the 
transient population. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off a weeklong campaign to register homeless people and transients to 
vote in California's June 5 primary, a local social service agency held an 
afternoon concert and voter registration drive at a Skid Row park. A van from 
the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office was parked nearby to 
register people to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Single Room Occupancy Housing Corp. -- a nonprofit organization that owns 
and operates 10 low-cost hotels in downtown Los Angeles -- held the afternoon 
event at San Julian Park on San Julian and East 5th streets. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're trying hard just to survive, registering to vote is not the first 
thing on your mind," said Kori Kanayama, a special assistant for the housing 
firm. "We want them to feel that their vote will count and that their vote is 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Starting today and ending Friday, all of the corporation's hotels will compete 
to register the most votes, said Doneg McDonough, an assistant director of the 
organization. The hotel with the most voters registered will win tickets to a 
Dodgers baseball game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Angelia Adams, a 33-year-old resident of the Southern Hotel on Skid Row, was 
among those registering to vote Sunday. She said money problems forced her to 
leave her South-Central Los Angeles home for the streets three years ago, and 
during that time her previous voter registration lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who begins a new job with the U.S. Census Bureau today, said: "I feel 
myself getting back into the real world and (voting) is something a responsible 
person has to do. You've got to know how the country runs and what it does. At 
last, I feel like a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
About 600 people attended the concert that served to spotlight the voter 
registration effort. By the end of the day, 61 people had registered to vote, 
Kanayama said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Santa Monica, about 150 people attended an afternoon public forum 
at the Santa Monica Library where they engaged in rancorous debate about how 
local officials should deal with the city's burgeoning homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the city's human services agency and tourism promotion office, 
as well as Santa Monica law enforcement officials, fielded often hostile 
questions from residents about the rising incidence of violence caused by 
transients in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said most of their efforts to combat the problem are futile 
because of social ills afflicting all of society -- such as a lack of 
affordable housing, jail overcrowding and a scarcity of programs for the 
mentally ill and those with alcohol and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless activists had feared that the meeting, organized by Concerned 
Homeowners of Santa Monica, would turn into an afternoon of homeless bashing. 
Some residents on hand, however, defended the city's efforts and the rights of 
the homeless, saying changes on the federal, state and county level are needed 
so that homeless people have a place to stay and a place to work. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica City Atty. Robert M. Myers, who was not present, bore the brunt of 
criticism for his reputation of being lenient on transients accused of 
misdemeanor violations such as public inebriation and sleeping in parks. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners' group recently took a survey of Santa Monica residents, who 
overwhelmingly reported that homelessness was their biggest concern.

ACQUISITION OF RANCH CALLED IMPORTANT FOR WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Runkle Ranch, a rugged 4,400-acre expanse of hidden canyons, jutting rock 
formations and shady meadows in the Santa Susana Mountains northwest of the 
city of Los Angeles, is the centerpiece of lands acquired by a state agency 
this month in a complicated property swap with entertainer Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Acquisition of the ranch is viewed by some wildlife experts as a major step 
toward safeguarding a 35-mile wildlife corridor from the Santa Susanas to the 
Santa Monicas and the sea. The property is home to bobcats, mountain lions and 
predatory birds that sweep down from sandstone pinnacles. Although less 
accessible to hikers than popular areas of the Santa Monicas, the ranch offers 
dramatic valley views and includes oak-studded meadows within a day's walk. 
</P>
<P>
The swap that allowed the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to acquire the 
ranch and other lands is not without its critics. Some parklands advocates fear 
that the deal's linchpin -- a trade of 59 acres of federal parklands in 
Cheeseboro Canyon in western Los Angeles County to a developer -- sets a 
dangerous precedent and would destroy another valuable wildlife habitat. This 
part of the deal still needs National Park Service approval. 
</P>
<P>
But because it enhances the corridor, some wildlife experts remain enthusiastic 
about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides linkages between entire mountainous regions that have not been 
able to be linked and in fact are becoming isolated islands in a sea of 
development," said Michael Soule, a UC Santa Cruz professor and a specialist in 
the ecology of wildlife corridors. "This is the last chance. If this deal 
doesn't go through, it really is the death knell for any link between the Santa 
Monica Mountains and the mountainous areas to the north." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Edelman, an ecologist who works with the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, is studying the wildlife corridor, which has grown increasingly 
important, and tenuous, as development in Los Angeles County moves relentlessly 
west into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as he does every week, he noted the tracks of animals who had 
funneled through one of the narrowest points of the corridor -- a tunnel 
beneath the Simi Valley Freeway on the south flank of Runkle Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"This looks like a raccoon right here," he said, pointing to a tiny hand-like 
print. "Here's a bobcat." 
</P>
<P>
Without Runkle Ranch in public ownership, said Edelman and Soule, the corridor 
would be threatened, and so would the long-term survival of the bobcats, 
raccoons and other wildlife that need room to migrate to maintain healthy, 
growing populations free of the problems caused when species inbreed. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch is the most significant part of 5,700 acres acquired from Hope this 
month for $20 million. In addition to its importance for preserving the 
wildlife corridor, the conservancy also points to the ranch's natural beauty, 
which can be seen in a diverse blend of landforms ranging from rocky peaks to 
flat, grass-covered meadows. 
</P>
<P>
"In a half-day hike, you're looking at seeing fossils and a picnic under an oak 
stand," said Joseph T. Edmiston, director of the conservancy. "You're looking 
at spectacular rock formations, to say nothing of views over both the San 
Fernando and Simi valleys." 
</P>
<P>
But critics are not mollified because of the proposed Cheeseboro Canyon swap. 
The developer, Potomac Investment Associates, needs the canyon parklands to 
build an access road to the 750 homes and golf course it wants to build on 
nearby Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County, which is also owned by Hope. If 
the land swap is not approved by the National Park Service, Runkle Ranch and 
the rest of the 5,700 acres would revert to ownership by Hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Hope's road to riches will destroy a critical wildlife habitat," said Mary 
Wiesbrock, an Agoura Hills activist who has called for Edmiston's ouster over 
the land swap. But she concedes that Runkle Ranch is worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch includes Blind Canyon, which Los Angeles County sanitation officials 
have considered as a possible landfill site. The precipitous depth that gives 
Blind Canyon its beauty also makes it suitable for use as a garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
South of Blind Canyon, a hiker may traverse a rugged part of Runkle Ranch where 
charred, chest-high chaparral frames sandstone rock formations that jut into 
the sky. Some are topped with bird droppings, indicating that predatory birds 
such as hawks use the rocks as hunting perches. 
</P>
<P>
At night, mountain lions and bobcats come out to hunt, although a person would 
be unlikely to encounter the shy predators, Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the ranch is a mountainside mosaic of seashell fossils. The 
fossils are so plentiful that the conservancy is restricting the area to 
supervised tours only, so they are not removed, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
At the northernmost reaches of Runkle Ranch, rocks and mountainsides give way 
to flat, grassy meadows leading eventually to the placid shade of Las Llajas 
Canyon, dense with oak, sycamore and cottonwood trees. 
</P>
<P>
But the value of the lands as a wildlife habitat depends on the animals' 
ability to move freely in and out, using paths such as the tunnel beneath the 
Simi Valley Freeway. If isolated or confined to one area, animal species may 
die out for a lack of genetic diversity because, in time, they begin mating 
with their cousins and become vulnerable to diseases and other inherited 
maladies, Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Livezey, a Nature Conservancy ecologist who has studied the wildlife 
corridor in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains, agreed that Runkle 
Ranch is important but warned that Jordan Ranch and Cheeseboro Canyon also are 
part of a significant wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"The Runkle Ranch should be a real help to the corridor, but that does not mean 
we can chop off a whole hunk" of Cheeseboro Canyon, Livezey said.

URGENT NEED TO SAVE WATER EVAPORATES IN DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the already parched Owens Valley of the Eastern Sierra Nevada, where Los 
Angeles traditionally gets the bulk of its water supplies, there has been 
hardly a drop of rain in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
But somehow, Los Angeles has been brought back from the brink of water 
rationing. 
</P>
<P>
At a packed news conference a month ago, Mayor Tom Bradley challenged Los 
Angeles to voluntarily cut water use by 10%, or prepare for imposition of 
mandatory water rationing within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do not achieve the level of conservation that we need . . . we're going 
to have to move immediately for the mandatory program," Bradley told reporters 
as he set an April 30 deadline for determining how the community responded to 
his call for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
But today, when the mayor returns to his City Hall office after a week's 
absence, there will be no decision on the city's need for water rationing and 
there will be no report on the public's conservation efforts, city officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Bradley and officials at the Department of Water and Power now say 
they do not plan to make any immediate decisions on rationing, but will 
continue to monitor water supplies, consumption rates and the effects of 
conservation during the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the next few weeks we will have to make the decision," said Mark 
Fabiani, Bradley's chief of staff. "We have not yet made a complete 
assessment." 
</P>
<P>
This softening of Bradley's stand is due in part to the DWP's acknowledged 
inability to measure water usage quickly, let alone determine how much -- if 
any -- increased conservation there has been. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps more important, some city officials said, the idea of rationing ran 
into a force more devastating that the four-year drought itself: reality. 
</P>
<P>
Justifying, imposing and enforcing water rationing can take a while, they 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials said residents need to have an opportunity to cut water use 
voluntarily, before rationing is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The city is in the first phase of the emergency water conservation law that 
encourages voluntary conservation and bans some wasteful water practices, like 
hosing down sidewalks and driveways. The DWP acknowledges that it has not 
actively or effectively enforced the law. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the DWP commissioners voted to hire squads of "drought busters" to 
cruise the city and ferret out water wasters. But officials acknowledge that it 
could take six weeks to two months before the first drought busters hit the 
streets. Just hiring the water cops, whether it is contracted out to a private 
company or handled directly by the city, could take six weeks or more, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A rationing plan could take longer still. 
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledge that it could take at least one month, and perhaps 
several, before the city would be able to establish a rationing plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how much pressure is exerted," said Harvey Uribe, assistant 
director of customer service at the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a rationing program, the DWP has begun searching for a 
manager to head an office of emergency conservation, and could make the 
appointment within a week. 
</P>
<P>
But other aspects of the program could take much longer. It could take weeks to 
assemble the staff of 20 to 30 workers and get the office space, telephones and 
computer terminals necessary, Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
Programming computers to track customer use could take a month or more, Uribe 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the City Council would have to adopt, and the mayor sign, a 
rationing law to replace and one that has been on the books since 1978 and is 
considered outdated and unworkable by the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
Timing of the program would be critical. To get the most out of the program, 
rationing would need to be in place during the hot summer months when water use 
is highest. 
</P>
<P>
But the full impact of the rationing program, which seeks to enforce savings by 
slapping surcharges on users who consume more than their alloted amount, may 
not hit until the fall, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the staggered, two-month billing cycle used by the DWP, many 
consumers would not have their meters checked for compliance under the law for 
months after rationing is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
No penalties would be assesed during the first four months of the program, 
because consumers would be allowed to average their water consumption over 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
Even if rationing started by June 1, the first penalties would not be assessed 
until October -- well past the peak water demands of summer. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the rationing law was implemented, in 1978, Los Angeles consumers 
were told to reduce their use of water by 10%, but they cut consumption by an 
estimated 19%, DWP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The looming penalty is the biggest incentive" to cut use, Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, during the 1978 rationing program, nearly 100,000 users repeatedly 
violated the law and faced having their water service restricted or shut off. 
</P>
<P>
But before that happened, the rains of winter came, rationing was quickly 
forgotten and violations were forgiven.

POLIO LOOKS TO BE ON THE WAY OUT 
</P>

<P>
International health officials predicted last week that they probably will 
succeed in eliminating polio from the Western Hemisphere by the end of this 
year, a major step in a campaign to eradicate the crippling disease from the 
globe by the year 2000. Polio, or poliomyelitis, caused by a virus in 
contaminated water and food, produced tens of thousands of cases of paralysis 
annually in the United States until the first effective vaccine was introduced 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, despite intensive case-tracking efforts, only three confirmed 
cases of polio caused by the natural virus have been found in the Americas, 
compared with 45 by this time last year, said Ciro de Quadros, regional adviser 
to the Expanded Program of Immunization for the Pan American Health 
Organization. Rare cases of paralytic polio also occur in recipients of the 
live-virus vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Because of successful vaccination programs, polio cases in the Western 
Hemisphere have been declining steeply over the last decade, from about 6,000 
annually in the late 1970s to 132 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Polio is a far bigger problem in the Eastern Hemisphere, causing more than 
200,000 cases of paralysis annually.

A spongelike plastic device implanted under the skin near arteries may help to 
prevent hardening of the arteries, researchers from the Harvard Medical School 
said last week at the ACS meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The implant acts something like a sponge, Dr. Elazer Edelman said, allowing the 
blood-thinning drug heparin to diffuse through tiny, porelike holes over a 
period of weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
Tests in animals show that as the drug is released it infiltrates into the 
arteries, where it appears to inhibit the multiplication of muscle cells that 
are involved with artery disease. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers think the rapid proliferation of smooth muscle cells is a major 
contributor to atherosclerosis, hardening of the arteries. When the cells 
combine with cholesterol within the wall of blood vessels, the result is the 
formation of fatty deposits that obstruct blood flow and can lead to heart 
attacks and strokes, studies show. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said one of the major problems facing researchers in the field of heart 
disease is how to prevent arteries from clogging up again once they have been 
cleared through a surgical procedure known as angioplasty. He said heparin has 
long been used for that purpose, but because it is a blood thinner, it has the 
potential to cause bleeding when it is administered intravenously. Delivering 
the drug directly to arteries with the implant may minimize that problem, he 
said.

A California chemist said last week that by using new knowledge about the 
chemical structures of sweet things, he has taught a computer to predict what a 
molecule will taste like before it is created. 
</P>
<P>
The work may reduce the need for special panels of human tasters to review 
everything food chemists concoct. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Goodman of UC San Diego said his computer model can forecast whether a 
type of molecule known as a peptide will be sweet, bitter or tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
Using the model, "We can take a sweet peptide and move a single carbon atom 
from one slot to another and lose the taste entirely," Goodman said during a 
national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston.

SOVIET ECONOMIC CRISIS DEEPENING; 
</P>
<P>
RESTRUCTURING: FIRST-QUARTER STATISTICS ARE DISMAL. SOME ECONOMISTS DOUBT THE 
COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union's economic crisis is deepening so rapidly that senior 
economists here are now expressing alarm about the country's ability to 
recover, whatever strategy the government decides upon. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the decline in industrial production, the drop in gross national 
product and national income, an increase in inflation and the spread of 
strikes, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Sunday that the Soviet 
economy is running virtually out of control as it deteriorates day by day. 
</P>
<P>
Despite concerted efforts to restructure the Soviet economy this year and last, 
production declined in most strategic sectors of industry in the first quarter 
of this year, according to official statistics published over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of consumer goods, which is the new focus of Soviet economic 
planning, was so limited in the first three months of the year that the gap 
between supplies and demand continued to grow, increasing inflationary 
pressures and adding to the rapidly mounting social unrest. Most food products 
are in very short supply, and their prices rose by 12% to 20% from January to 
March. 
</P>
<P>
The country's money supply is growing so fast, an estimated six to eight times 
the rate in the early 1980s, that the country is facing uncontrollable 
inflation in which the ruble could soon have almost no purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
"The quarter was difficult, and the destructive processes in the economy have 
gathered strength," Pravda's economics editor, Yegor Gaidar, wrote, summing up 
the widely shared analysis of the country's increasingly desperate situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The escalating financial crisis took us to the very edge -- after which 
suppressed inflation will break into the open, regardless of government or 
trade union efforts to contain it." 
</P>
<P>
Similar observations came from virtually all Soviet economic commentators over 
the weekend as well as from the State Statistics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The economy's problems are evident not only in the way that the Soviet economy 
shrank in the first quarter of the year, Gaidar argued, but in developments 
that will mean even greater problems in subsequent months. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp growth in the value of retail trade, he noted, came largely through 
increased sales of alcohol, through more imported goods -- and through 
inflation. When adjusted for higher prices, the value of goods on sale 
increased only 1% over the first quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, personal incomes, rising 13%, grew nearly twice as fast as planned, 
and the shortages were consequently felt even more acutely. 
</P>
<P>
Meat supplies, already declining, are likely to drop further because of an 
acute shortage of livestock feed. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in enterprise profits will delay retooling for the production of 
consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
And state expenses, which were to be held in check this year, are ballooning 
once again, and the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, is debating new 
programs that will increase them further. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation here is well known in international experience -- the weaker the 
national currency the firmer and tougher the pressure to run the printing 
presses faster to turn out more money," Gaidar said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Committee noted in its typically dry comments, "Stability 
and equilibrium have not yet been achieved in the national economy," then 
proceeded to provide a numerical picture of a collapsing economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's gross national product, the value of all the goods and 
services produced by the country, dropped by 1% compared to the same period a 
year ago, according to the report, and national income, which measures the 
value added to goods through production, declined 2%. Industrial production 
itself was down 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
These were all developments so rare in an economy that grows even in the most 
serious adversity that observers here could only compare the situation to World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the contraction of the economy will make it more difficult, according to 
a number of economists, to shift it to market forces as planned. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning a car that is going forward is a lot easier than turning one that is 
standing still," one economic commentator wrote, "and we are rolling backwards, 
almost out of control." 
</P>
<P>
The output of oil, coal and natural gas was down by 4% to 6%, according to the 
quarterly report. Enterprise profits declined 7.4% -- although the firms were 
allowed to keep more of what they earned. Exports to Eastern Europe, still 
Moscow's most important source of trading partners, dropped nearly 10%, while 
imports fell 11%. Western goods were being imported 50% faster than hard 
currency could be earned to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
Production of consumer goods did rise by 4.7%, but the growth of wages as part 
of the overall increase in the money supply was such that the gap between 
demand and supply increased and inflation grew by official calculation at the 
rate of 8% -- but perhaps as much as twice that. 
</P>
<P>
Food supplies were down, in some cases sharply, as production of meat, milk, 
eggs and vegetables all dropped, according to the quarterly report. Prices for 
meat at farmers' markets rose by 16%, vegetables by 13% and fruit by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign debts were rising, the trade deficit was growing and, for the first 
time, Soviet credit-worthiness is in doubt as enterprises are unable to meet 
the deadlines for payments to Western banks. 
</P>
<P>
The country's economic collapse seemed to be predicted by almost every line of 
the lengthy quarterly report published over the weekend by the State Statistics 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has come under mounting political pressure in 
recent weeks to pull the country out of this crisis, but he acknowledged last 
week that there is no consensus on what needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Council (Cabinet) rejected as too disruptive -- it would have 
meant twofold or threefold price increases and extensive unemployment -- a 
package of radical measures that would have moved most of the economy from 
central planning to a system based largely on the market forces of supply and 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
But the contents and timing of that program have been debated fiercely within 
the government and Communist Party, and so far no consensus has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, speaking to workers last week in Sverdlovsk, a major industrial 
center in the Ural Mountains, recalled how a radical plan first proposed last 
autumn for the transformation of the economy had been scaled back and slowed 
down because of likely problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We were planning to move more slowly," he said, "but then we saw the process 
of industry of the last three or four months. We noted that negative tendencies 
are not disappearing; on the contrary, they are increasing. One should not wait 
anymore. Everything that was scheduled for 1992 and 1993 should be done, and 
the main work on transferring to the market should start next year." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov is now attempting to pull together another 
less radical package, which he says he will present to the Supreme Soviet in 
the middle of May. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a clear opportunity to make a transition to a regulated market economy 
without complications and in an organized way," Ryzhkov told a new farmers' 
organization on Friday. The new government plan, mixing central planning and 
market forces, "will be precisely the balanced version that we should offer to 
the people to get their support," he promised. 
</P>
<P>
But there is much debate about this. The probable price increases have drawn 
strong objections as has the likely upsurge of unemployment. Trade unions, 
supported by party conservatives, oppose creation of an "employing class" and a 
new urban bourgeoisie nearly seven decades after their abolition. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Y. Petrakov, Gorbachev's economic adviser, argued that the current 
economic crisis has become so severe that what he called "half-measures" cannot 
be used. While the government does not intend to adopt a "shock therapy," as 
Poland has done, Petrakov said that the country must be moved quickly and 
firmly to a market basis. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no easy way toward the normalization of the economy," Petrakov told 
the newspaper Workers' Tribune.

AFGHAN REBELS DIVIDED, MAY DROP HOLY WAR 
</P>

PESHAWAR, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Afghanistan's Islamic resistance, hailed as a brave anti-Communist crusade in 
the 10 years that brought billions of dollars in U.S. military aid, has all but 
given up its holy war against the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen months after the last Soviet soldier withdrew from Afghanistan, the 
rebels, known as the moujahedeen, are hopelessly divided. And, according to 
Afghan, Pakistani and Western experts, they have in recent weeks killed more of 
their own than the enemy, the armed forces of Afghan President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
Rival resistance commanders have been gunned down gangland-style here in the 
border town of Peshawar, the staging area for the war. There are persistent 
reports of large-scale political killings in the refugee camps on the Pakistani 
side of the border, and many of the 4 million or more Afghans still in the 
camps say they live in fear of the ragtag force that once fought bravely to 
protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Many disillusioned rebel commanders who helped to drive the Soviet army out of 
Afghanistan are turning their attention from the battlefield to the poppy 
field, fueling the multibillion-dollar global heroin trade. 
</P>
<P>
The poppy fields and the laboratories of Pakistan already supply more than 
one-third of the heroin sold on American streets, and narcotics agents fear 
that this activity is on the brink of exploding. 
</P>
<P>
A recent execution in Peshawar -- the machine-gun slaying of rebel commander 
Mullah Nasim Akhunzada -- had as much to do with drugs as politics. Mullah 
Nasim, nicknamed by narcotics agents the "heroin king of Helmand province," 
controlled vast poppy fields that became the arena for a drug war late last 
year in southern Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Other commanders, in Afghanistan and in the border camps, are simply refusing 
to fight. They say privately that they prefer Najibullah to the hard-line 
moujahedeen fundamentalists led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. 
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar is one of seven leaders in the rebel alliance that has all but 
disintegrated since Hekmatyar allied himself last month with former Afghan 
Defense Minister Shahnawaz Tanai, who fled Kabul after mounting an abortive 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
When the attempted coup began, many of the refugees in the camps, and many 
rebels -- men who had risked their lives to destroy Najibullah -- crowded into 
the mosques and prayed for his survival. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, people are saying that if it is possible to welcome the devils, men like 
Tanai who have killed so many Afghans, then what have we been fighting for all 
these many years?" Naim Majrooh, an Afghan intellectual who runs a moujahedeen 
information center here, said to a recent visitor. 
</P>
<P>
These developments have led U.S. analysts to rethink their support for the 
moujahedeen. A diplomat said: "No one wants to be the last Afghan to die for 
nothing, and America shouldn't be the last country to finance the rebellion. 
This year is probably the time to cut and run." 
</P>
<P>
Whether to continue the clandestine CIA program that has funneled more than $2 
billion in weapons to the rebels over the last six years is a question that is 
likely to be high on the agenda next month when President Bush meets with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviets are still sending arms to 
the Najibullah regime. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and other authorities on Afghan affairs say that Washington is likely 
to be more receptive than ever to a proposal that both sides stop providing 
arms to the Afghans. 
</P>
<P>
"Either way, the whole U.S. assistance package is finished at the end of the 
year," a diplomat in Islamabad said. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Peshawar, the Afghans explain why. 
</P>
<P>
"It's finished; there is no more jihad (holy war)," said Abdullah Ali, an 
Afghan technocrat who fled to Pakistan a decade ago. "With whom do we make 
jihad? It is only Afghan fighting Afghan, so no one is willing to lay down his 
life anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The intellectual Majrooh, whose father was assassinated two years ago after 
publicly condemning fundamentalist leader Hekmatyar, said, "The motivation for 
fighting is lost." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Hekmatyar's people, and other fundamentalist factions, are 
"wearing the mask of Islam on their faces, and yet they are selling the food 
for widows and orphans for profit." 
</P>
<P>
"They are assassinating and terrorizing people in Pakistan," he added. "These 
people are more guilty than those in Kabul. It is a very depressing time." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic observers in Pakistan, who have been studying the war for years, 
seem equally depressed. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago," a European diplomat said, "the situation was a mess. It's still a 
mess -- but now, frankly, it's a shambles." 
</P>
<P>
Another Western diplomat said: "Everybody's sick and tired of Afghanistan now. 
They're sick of this phase of the war. Either you're going to fight to the last 
Afghan, or you're going to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a total fracture of the rebel organization, horizontally and 
vertically, and there's no way you can turn that around. The whole thing is 
just so sick the situation is becoming surreal. It is scandalous." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most scandalous aspects of the present phase of the war, according to 
diplomats other than the Americans, as well as many prominent Afghans, is the 
U.S. aid effort to prop up the controversial rebel government in exile that was 
formed last year in Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
By virtually all accounts, millions of dollars in U.S. aid have been squandered 
on a government that even a U.S. official conceded "was never supposed to be 
anything more than a hollow shell." 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified by name, said: "All you had in 
Peshawar was a bunch of Humpty Dumptys without any form or substance. The 
thought was that the Afghan interim government would not have to be a 
government per se. All you needed was a bunch of figureheads who could go into 
Kabul and take over when the regime there fell. The problem was the 
miscalculation that the Kabul regime would fall within months of the Soviet 
withdrawal -- and of course it never fell." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the exile government, made up mostly of senior members of the 
seven-party rebel alliance, continued to receive money from the United States 
and Saudi Arabia, their other major foreign backer. With virtually no 
accountability, they used the money to set up offices, buy vehicles, bring in 
imported equipment and take on massive staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has run a 
largely successful five-year program to send humanitarian aid from Pakistan to 
rebels fighting across the border, put about $450,000 into the exile 
government. But several reliable sources said that millions more was spent 
unofficially. 
</P>
<P>
"The real story here isn't the $450,000," an aid official said, asking not to 
be identified by name. "The real story is how many people this government has 
put on its payroll since Feb. 15 -- it's well into the hundreds -- and how many 
have actually shown up for work -- few to none. What has happened is that this 
government has turned itself into a hiring hall." 
</P>
<P>
Afghan intellectuals like Naim Majrooh and Abdullah Ali say the continuing flow 
of aid, combined with the rebels' plummeting morale, has generated a cult of 
corruption that is further eroding the rebels' will to fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The political system that is functioning here in Pakistan is a farce," said 
Ali, who is an adviser to an exile government agency that has received some of 
the aid money. "They're going to kill the Afghans with such a system. And the 
longer this system continues, the stronger Najib will become." 
</P>
<P>
Majrooh said: "We have compromised our ideals with outsiders, and now we 
Afghans -- all Afghans -- are losing the war. Jihad, you see, is a purely 
Islamic struggle for the liberation of the homeland, and for years it was. But 
now there are no Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and it is clear that those who 
have been talking about holy war just want to take the power and the money for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Jihad is also sacrifice, life-and-death sacrifice, and the question we are all 
asking now is, sacrifice for whom?"

2ND AMERICAN TO BE FREED, BEIRUT MESSAGES DECLARE

An American educator held hostage in Beirut, Frank H. Reed, will be freed 
within 48 hours, according to statements delivered to news offices in the 
Lebanese capital Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The statements were accompanied by photos of Reed, a native of Malden, Mass., 
the first hard evidence of him since his kidnaping on Sept. 9, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge to free the 57-year-old school official came one week after 
pro-Iranian kidnapers in Beirut released Robert Polhill, a college professor 
who had been held captive for 39 months. Polhill, 55, was the first American 
hostage to be released in 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
An initial communique on Reed, delivered to an international news agency and 
the Lebanese newspaper An Nahar, was unsigned. But a second message, dropped at 
the newspaper three hours later, identified the kidnapers under the name 
Islamic Dawn, which has never before surfaced in the long-running hostage 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But an article in today's Tehran Times appeared to place Reed's abductors among 
the 100 or more pro-Iranian extremists whom Western intelligence services hold 
responsible for the majority of the Beirut kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
As monitored by Associated Press in Nicosia, the article quoted an unidentified 
Iranian official as saying that "extensive talks" took place after the release 
of Polhill, apparently between Iranian authorities and the kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked them to release a second hostage unconditionally and on humanitarian 
and Islamic grounds to once again display their goodwill," the official told 
the Tehran Times. 
</P>
<P>
"We do believe that with the fulfillment of this promise, the Lebanese Muslim 
groups have displayed maximum goodwill. The ball is now in the other party's 
court to reciprocate," the article said, in an apparent reference to the United 
States or other Western nations whose citizens have been held hostage in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, President Bush was asked about the report while playing 
golf at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. He told journalists: "I just 
won't say anything. If that proves to be true, that's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman said: "We remain hopeful; we hope this report is 
true, and we continue to urge the release of all the hostages." But he said 
Washington has had no contact with the kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.), chairman of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee, said he is "very optimistic that we're going to see 
more hostages released." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press," Boren said his optimism stems in part 
from the fact that both Iran and Syria, which are believed to have influence on 
the kidnapers, are experiencing economic problems and need stronger ties with 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
After Polhill's release April 22, statements by Lebanese militants and Arab 
press reports speculated that a second American hostage would soon be freed, 
but by the middle of last week, remarks from the same sources left the momentum 
of the breakthrough on the hostages in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Typewritten in Arabic, Sunday's initial statement on Reed said: 
</P>
<P>
"In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, we have decided to free 
American hostage Frank Reed within 48 hours. He will carry a message addressed 
to the American Administration." 
</P>
<P>
No conditions were set, and there was no further information immediately 
available in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
According to press reports from the Lebanese capital, each of the copies was 
accompanied by a different photo of Reed, who was director of the Lebanese 
International School when he was abducted from his chauffeured car on the way 
to a golf club near the Beirut airport. 
</P>
<P>
One photo, in color, showed him in a blue-and-white striped shirt and clean 
shaven. The other, in black and white, depicted a bearded face. 
</P>
<P>
While the accompanying statement was not signed, the last previous 
communication on Reed -- until Sunday there had been none since Sept. 14, 1986 
-- said he was a captive of the Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab Revolutionary Cells is one of many cover names for the terrorist 
organization run by Abu Nidal, a Palestinian believed to be operating out of 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
After news reports about the statement were broadcast, mentioning the Omar 
Mukhtar Brigade, a subsequent message was sent to An Nahar, with a third photo 
of Reed. That message read: 
</P>
<P>
"We assert that the (first) statement we issued did not carry the signature of 
the Organization of Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade. News 
agencies . . . should seek accuracy in news reporting. Otherwise they will be 
exposed to our persecution and stern punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"We also stress our previous statement that we shall release American hostage 
Frank Reed with a message for the U.S. Administration. We hope the media will 
carry our statement fully without tampering." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Reed's kidnaping, the initial claim of responsibility came from 
a telephone caller saying he represented Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian faction 
of Lebanese Shiite Muslims. Islamic Jihad issued a statement disavowing any 
part in the kidnaping, and the subsequent claim was made in the name of the 
Omar Mukhtar Brigade, the mystery group whose only professed hostage is Reed. 
</P>
<P>
The release of Polhill, five days after his kidnapers said he would be freed 
within 48 hours, signaled a break in the agonizing ordeal of the foreign 
hostages. The Bush Administration, while declaring it had made no deal for the 
release of the professor and would not negotiate with kidnapers for the freedom 
of others, applauded the Syrian government for its role. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III also said, "We thank Iran for these 
efforts, noting the Iranians have a responsibility to help secure the release 
of other hostages in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
The initial signs of movement on the deadlocked hostage crisis appeared earlier 
this year in the Tehran Times, a newspaper aligned with President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, whose centrist administration supports improved relations with 
Western powers. 
</P>
<P>
Polhill was held by a group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of 
Palestine, and he told an American debriefing team in Wiesbaden, West Germany, 
that the only hostages he saw during his captivity were Jesse Turner and Alann 
Steen, fellow professors from Beirut University College who were abducted with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
American counterintelligence officials say they believe that all the Beirut 
kidnap groups, which now hold seven Americans and several other Westerners, are 
closely related and may simply use different cover names.

E. GERMANY SAYS IT WOULD OK A POLITICAL NATO 
</P>

<P>
East Germany proposed Sunday that a united Germany become a member of NATO if 
the Western alliance changes its "strategy and structures," transforming itself 
into a political and economic alliance rather than a military grouping 
confronting the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, completing a day of talks with President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders, said he believes this approach 
could ensure the Soviet Union's security and meet the West's demands that a 
united Germany be anchored politically within the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO should create new structures and new strategies, and under those we could 
become a member of NATO," De Maiziere said, focusing on what has become a key 
issue in the fast-moving process that seems certain to reunify East and West 
Germany shortly, after 45 years as separate states. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, for which German unity is a political, military and economic 
problem of immense complexity and acute sensitivity, wants the reunified 
Germany to be neutral or nonaligned or, in ways not well explained, a member of 
both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, who was on his first foreign trip since becoming prime minister 
this month after East Germany's first free elections, acknowledged that 
Gorbachev has not accepted his proposal. But he said he felt that the Soviet 
leader has not rejected the initiative and might agree in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the Soviet Union has not formulated its final position on this 
issue," De Maiziere said. "That . . . makes it possible to find solutions in 
talks with the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that the Soviet Union "remains negative toward unilateral, 
unbalanced proposals" for German membership in NATO, the official Soviet news 
agency Tass reported later. 
</P>
<P>
"This attitude stems from political realism and a serious concern about 
prospects for Europe and new approaches to its problems," Gorbachev told De 
Maiziere, according to Tass. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, acknowledging Gorbachev's objections, said, "Our differences now 
stem from the fact that the rapid unification of Germany requires quick 
decisions on those issues." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev declared that "Germany's entry into NATO is unacceptable, and another 
way must be found," De Maiziere continued, "and we will not enter and we will 
look for another way." 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin now plans to place its proposal for the "fundamental restructuring 
of NATO" and subsequent German membership before Britain, France, the Soviet 
Union and the United States when the four victors in World War II meet with 
East and West Germany this week in Bonn to discuss the issues involved in 
German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, reflecting a growing German consensus between East Berlin and 
Bonn, argued strongly against both neutrality and membership in either NATO or 
the Warsaw Pact, as the two military blocs are now constituted, for the new 
German state that is likely to emerge from intense diplomatic and political 
maneuvering now under way. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important is to obviate these blocs, to dismantle and do away with 
them," De Maiziere told a press conference. "Neutrality implies division and 
confrontation. We in Germany do not want to play the role of a buffer. This is 
unacceptable to us." 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, articulating thinking that is as prevalent in Bonn as in East 
Berlin, said that he envisions fundamental changes in NATO so that its forces 
are sharply reduced, their structure changed to make them entirely defensive 
and the alliance reoriented from confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, with 
matching new strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that NATO should change before we discuss the issue of our 
membership," the East German leader reiterated. "That is our point of 
departure. We can then think about our future. Without that, negotiations are 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
What Germans would like to see, he continued, would be a new European security 
system, emerging from both all-European talks and disarmament negotiations now 
under way, that takes into account the interests of both sides but ends the 
confrontation between the two powerful military alliances, their forces now 
concentrated on German territory. 
</P>
<P>
When put into practice, this would mean, De Maiziere suggested, a NATO focus on 
disarmament as a principal goal of the alliance, a Soviet-American agreement to 
withdraw tactical nuclear weapons from German territory and an end to the 
forward-basing of NATO and Warsaw Pact troops under which both East and West 
Germany remain occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere said that NATO should make the first moves. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev said he is prepared to negotiate about the question of alliances 
only (after) new strategies and structures are in place," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, which at first insisted on full German neutrality, appears to 
be shifting its position in advance of this week's talks in Bonn. Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, spoke in an interview with the Irish 
Times on Saturday of a nonaligned status for Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is probably to devise a military and political status 
for a united Germany that would not radically tip the (European) balance," 
Shevardnadze said, according to an account of the interview by Tass. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this can be achieved fully if Germany becomes a militarily 
nonaligned state whose armed forces would have a potential sufficient only for 
defense purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet foreign minister, renewing Moscow's proposal for German membership 
in both NATO and the Warsaw Pact for a transition period, said the country 
could then become "a place where (the alliances) would be gradually dissolved" 
and replaced by security arrangements agreed upon in all-European negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The present military and political structures on the European Continent . . . 
were shaped not for a united Germany but for two German states belonging to 
different alliances," Shevardnadze said in his interview with the Irish Times. 
"It would be a mistake to destroy the existing security systems in the course 
of building German unity without creating new ones to replace them." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, meeting with Markus Meckel, the East German foreign minister, 
reaffirmed Moscow's support of German unification, but with a warning that it 
must strengthen rather than undermine European stability. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that history has given Germans a chance to build a united Germany," 
Shevardnadze said, according to Tass, "it is important to act responsibly and 
in accordance with good sense. Legitimate interests of other nations must be 
taken into account in order to ensure controlled progress toward unification, 
coordinated with the all-Europe process." 
</P>
<P>
In their talks with De Maiziere, Gorbachev, Shevardnadze and Prime Minister 
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov all stressed the Soviet Union's desire to continue its 
longstanding economic relationship with East Germany, which is Moscow's biggest 
trading partner.

300,000-ACRE HISTORIC HOME ON RANGE 4 SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New Mexico cattle ranch only slightly smaller than the state of Rhode Island 
and encompassing a mountain range, bat caves, vineyards and room for 3,000 head 
of cattle is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The historic Armendaris Ranch, the largest contiguous ranch in the United 
States, is scheduled to go on the block May 9 in an unusual simulcast auction 
to be held in Albuquerque, Los Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Opening bid for this 300,000-acre sea of sagebrush where deer and antelope 
still roam is $4.6 million. But potential buyers beware: Those who have looked 
at the land include some really big spenders from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given tours of the place to Japanese corporate executives thinking about 
raising cattle to ship home where beef is $35 a pound," said Steven L. Good, 
president of Sheldon Good &amp; Co., the Chicago-based realty firm handling the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We've also had guys out here with belt buckles the size of silver serving 
platters," Good said, "as well as blue pin-stripe bankers dodging cow paddies 
in their wing-tip shoes." 
</P>
<P>
The well-heeled interested in looking the place over, however, need not worry 
about smudging their shoes. The realty company has a fleet of airplanes and 
helicopters available to provide aerial tours that typically take two hours to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect there will be a whole variety of potential buyers at the auction -- 
Americans, Europeans, Asians, South Americans, even conservation groups," Good 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bid that is greatest will get the ranch," he said, adding that the place 
will be sold either in one piece or in three huge parcels. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch, which lies 200 miles south of Albuquerque and just to the northeast 
of the town of Truth or Consequences, was originally granted by King Ferdinand 
VII of Spain to a garrison lieutenant named Pedro Ascue de Armendaris in 1819. 
</P>
<P>
The property includes a 250,000-year-old lava flow from a nearby volcano that 
formed the Jornada Bat Cave, home to 5 million Mexican free-tail bats. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the grounds, but excluded from the sale, is Ft. Craig, which was built 
in 1854 to protect westbound miners from Indians. The fort sits seven miles 
from Val Verde, the site of a Feb. 21, 1862 Civil War battle. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 100 years, the property has been managed as a cattle ranch by 10 
owners -- among them William Randolph Hearst and Alfred Hitchcock. It is now 
owned by Oppenheimer Industries Inc. of Kansas City, which hopes to use 
proceeds from the sale to build houses and resort hotels on 86,000 acres of 
property on Elephant Butte Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so vast there are several things careful management can do with this 
property," said Robert Levy, corporate attorney for Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Such pronouncements have raised hopes in sleepy Truth or Consequences of new 
development that could boost the economy of the town of 7,500 that took its 
name from an old television program on a dare in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all for the auction," said Jim Streicher, editor of a Truth or 
Consequences newspaper called The Herald. "We're hopeful they (Oppenheimer) 
sell the property so they can start spending some of that money around here."

SAMARITAN WHO AIDED ILLEGALS IS LATEST VICTIM OF INCREASING BORDER VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His friends say Miguel Angel Cancino Rios, known as Tobi, was a kind of border 
good Samaritan, intervening on behalf of prospective victims targeted by the 
thieves who prowl the no-man's land that is the U.S.-Mexico border strip in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked to help people," recalled Alex Campos, a close friend who says 
Cancino, a Tijuana resident, roomed with him in his home in the San Diego 
border neighborhood of San Ysidro. "He hated to see people get robbed or hurt 
out there," said Campos, gesturing to the border canyons whose many paths lead 
directly past his driveway. "Tobi hated to see that." 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Cancino, a former carwash employee and canyon vendor, played the 
role of border benefactor for the last time. A thief shot him several times in 
the head and neck, an incident that friends and a witness say occurred after 
Cancino directed several robbers to leave a group of immigrants alone. 
</P>
<P>
Cancino was the fourth and most recent fatality in a bloody two-month period 
along the heavily traveled, two-mile slice of the border just to the west of 
the giant port of entry at San Ysidro. The violence has the community -- from 
undocumented border-crossers to vendors to smugglers -- jittery about their 
well-being. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's safe here now," said Miguel Angel Ponce, a chunky smuggler who says 
he has guided groups into San Diego for two years and who was alongside Cancino 
when he was shot. The two were drinking beer, singing and talking, Ponce said, 
when the two assailants passed by and one gunned down Cancino after he told 
them to stop robbing a nearby group of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared. We're all scared now," Ponce said as he stood at a hilltop spot 
about 50 yards from a cross marking a fatal border shooting April 15. Half a 
dozen border-crossers waited for Ponce alongside the cross. 
</P>
<P>
Violent thieves have long prowled the canyon-studded border zone, where 
hundreds of vulnerable would-be immigrants, many carrying their life's savings, 
gather each afternoon, staging for the move north. Many are scared and 
unfamiliar with the area. Women and children are increasingly among the 
border-crossers. 
</P>
<P>
Darkness provides convenient cover for criminals, many of whom are 
glue-sniffers and abusers of other drugs. The robbers usually work in groups, 
often encircling 15 or 20 border-crossers. Rapes and robberies are common. 
Assailants are usually armed, often with pistols. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the area's violent reputation, border-crossers and authorities say the 
last two months have been particularly bloody -- especially in the hillside 
crossing area to the west of San Ysidro. That rugged strip has emerged as 
perhaps the area's most concentrated undocumented crossing zone since U.S. 
authorities installed stadium-type lighting last year along the flood-control 
levees of the Tia Juana River, which prompted many of the migrants who once 
crossed in the levee area to move westward. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves -- known as bajadores (literally, "downers,") or bajapollos 
("chicken-downers," after the pollo or "chicken" sobriquet widely applied to 
undocumented border-crossers) -- have followed the movement westward. And, with 
more people crossing -- U.S. immigration authorities say arrests of 
undocumented foreigners have increased by more than 50% in San Diego during the 
last six months -- the numbers of thieves appear to have grown commensurately. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most recent victims was a 13-year-old boy, Roberto Camunas Cortes, 
who was shot in the head March 12 near the levees. Robbery is suspected as a 
motive in this and the other border slayings, police say, although no suspects 
have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police say they have bolstered patrols in the border area because of 
the violence. A uniformed, six-person Border Crime Intervention Unit regularly 
makes rounds through the zone. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've observed there has been an increase in violent crime along the 
border recently, and we are taking steps to correct that," said Lt. Bill Brown 
of the San Ysidro station, who declined to elaborate on the steps being 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of Roberto Martinez, a longtime advocate for immigrants, San Diego 
police should be doing a lot more to stem the crime problem against the 
helpless border-crossers. However, he and other activists caution that patrols 
must be deployed in a way to minimize shootings by the police and U.S. 
immigration agents, who critics say have wrongly shot migrants in the past, 
mistaking them in the darkness for thieves -- an allegation heatedly denied by 
city and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The police need to be out there doing something, but not shooting innocent 
people," said Martinez, border representative for the social-action arm of the 
Quaker Church. "Right now, the violence is the worst that I've seen it in 
awhile."

REPORT URGES STRICTER STANDARDS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: CAMPUSES SHOULD DO MORE TO BATTLE ALCOHOL ABUSE, RACISM AND CRIME, 
CARNEGIE FOUNDATION STUDY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All American colleges and universities should adopt and enforce codes of 
student conduct to deal with alcohol abuse, racism and crime, according to a 
report to be released today by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching. 
</P>
<P>
The report does not argue for revival of in loco parentis, the philosophy 
mainly abandoned in the 1960s that allowed colleges to have parental-like 
control over students' lives. Yet, the pendulum has swung too far in the other 
direction, the study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
"No one would argue that colleges can or should return to the days of tight 
control," states the report, conducted in conjunction with the American Council 
on Education. "But does this mean that there are no standards by which conduct 
can be measured? 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that a college or university must be a disciplined community, a 
place where there are appropriate rules governing campus life, an institution 
where individuals acknowledge their obligations to the group." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many campuses nationwide have beefed up rules against alcohol 
abuse and racial or sexual harassment. Sometimes, that has proven 
controversial, as students complained about violations of their freedom of 
speech and conduct. For example, Stanford University is debating a proposal to 
ban ethnic insults. The University of California recently adopted similar rules 
governing personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are really trying to pursue two somewhat conflicting goals of 
encouraging freedom of expression and also discouraging discriminatory 
harassment, it's really tricky to figure out where you draw the line, one from 
the other," Sally Cole, the Stanford official who reviews student conduct 
problems, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the report's conclusions, Sheila Allen, president of the Graduate 
Student Assn. at UC San Francisco, said: "We don't think you can legislate 
rules for morals. We don't think that would be the best way for changing 
things. We think open discussion would be better." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Carnegie Foundation, American higher education "is, by almost 
any measure, a remarkable success." Yet, the report concludes, "the idyllic 
vision so routinely portrayed in college promotional materials often masks 
disturbing realities of student life." 
</P>
<P>
The report's survey of 382 campus presidents showed alcohol abuse to be the 
most serious problem of campus life, followed by student apathy, security, 
inadequate facilities and race relations. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol abuse was described as a moderate to major problem by 67% of the school 
presidents; 24% said racial tensions were at least moderately troubling, 
although that figure jumped to 68% when limited to presidents of large, 
research universities like Stanford or UC. The survey found that officials were 
concerned about drug abuse, but that alcohol was a far more serious problem on 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Student conduct regulations have become more explicit and enforcement more 
systematic over the last five years at more than half of American colleges, 
said the survey, entitled "Campus Life: In Search of Community." 
</P>
<P>
Allen Yarnell, UCLA's assistant vice chancellor for student and campus life, 
said the Carnegie study accurately reflects a national trend. "There clearly is 
a movement in the country for (colleges) to gain back some more 
responsibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Yarnell added that such a movement has its limits. For example, UCLA wants 
the many moped riders on its campus to wear helmets, but cannot require that 
because state law allows them to drive without helmets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other matters, the Carnegie study urges that colleges require students to 
take courses about the heritage and traditions of minorities. Several schools, 
including UC Berkeley and UC Irvine, already do so. 
</P>
<P>
The report also took a harsh view toward the possibly corrupting effect of 
big-money sports on campus life, saying: "When celebration (of athletics) 
becomes hype and hysteria, when it leads to dishonesty and to the establishment 
of a double academic standard, when it no longer truly serves the students, the 
time has come for an institution to reexamine its priorities and build its 
tradition on integrity, not abuse."

RETURNED ANC EXILES GLIMPSE END OF APARTHEID; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: THEY PROMOTE 'SPIRIT OF CONCILIATION' AT MASSIVE RALLY. TALKS 
WITH GOVERNMENT BEGIN THIS WEEK.

<P>
The highest-ranking exiled leaders of the African National Congress, speaking 
directly to South Africans for the first time in three decades, told a rally 
here Sunday that this week's talks with the government signal the beginning of 
the end of "the misery of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa shall never be the same again," ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo 
told about 10,000 supporters gathered on a soggy sports field on a cold, 
blustery day. "Ours is a society in transition to a new order." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most remarkable scenes in the nation's history, Nzo, South 
African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo and other leaders who direct the ANC's 
guerrilla war against Pretoria mounted a stage in this mixed-race township near 
Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so weird . . . so very strange to see Joe Slovo up there," said Alexandra 
Noble, a 20-year-old white college student in the crowd of black, white, 
mixed-race and Indian faces. 
</P>
<P>
Nzo, Slovo and their colleagues, who returned Friday from exile in Zambia, have 
for years been the most notorious of the white government's enemies. Until 
February, their words and even their photographs were banned from the country's 
books, newspapers and television. 
</P>
<P>
Their public appearance Sunday, guarded by their aides as well as South African 
police officers, indicated just how far South Africa has come in the 2 1/2 
months since President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the bans on anti-apartheid 
groups and invited the ANC and others to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
"We are together at last, and we are here because you, the people of South 
Africa, made it happen," said Slovo, a 63-year-old white lawyer who fled South 
Africa at age 35 under threat of arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Slovo was the ANC's chief military strategist and directed 
operations that killed or maimed hundreds of black and white civilians. As 
leader of the Communist Party and member of the ANC's executive committee, he 
is a key figure in the ANC-Communist Party alliance and the leader most feared 
by many white South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo and Nzo, the day's keynote speakers, abandoned much of the war talk that 
has characterized ANC speeches in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come in a spirit of conciliation," Slovo said. "If there is a way 
forward without bloodshed, the whole world knows we will grab it with both 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
During three days of talks beginning Wednesday, an ANC delegation, led by 
Nelson Mandela, and a government team, led by De Klerk, will discuss the 
remaining obstacles to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Among those hurdles are the ANC's insistence that the four-year-old state of 
emergency be lifted, that political prisoners be freed and that the 15,000 ANC 
exiles be indemnified from prosecution. The government wants the ANC to abandon 
its armed struggle, which De Klerk claims has fueled an upsurge of township 
violence in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC leaders used the forum Sunday to explain their reasons for agreeing to 
government talks, a move that has been criticized by many young ANC supporters 
who believe De Klerk has not yet moved far enough to warrant talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come to the table in search of a future of peace and equality," Slovo 
said. He criticized "armchair revolutionaries," an apparent reference to the 
radical black Pan-Africanist Congress. Groups like the PAC "scream treason when 
the word dialogue is mentioned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo praised De Klerk's "courage" in removing some of the obstacles to peace 
in South Africa. But he said the president "has only removed one or two bolts 
from the door. The master lock has not yet been opened." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the blame, he said, lies with white South Africans "who have allowed 
their human feelings to be washed away by their swimming pools and champagne." 
</P>
<P>
Slovo said the ANC needs to see more reforms from the government before it 
considers relinquishing its 30-year-old armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"It is because we spoke with the AK-47 (rifle) that dialogue is at least in the 
air," he said. "We will be ready to walk through the door (for negotiations) 
when we see signs of real democracy. Short of that we will have to break down 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
Slovo also outlined the ANC's negotiating strategy, reassuring opponents of the 
government that his organization would not back down from its demands for 
majority rule, a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution and a 
redistribution of wealth. The government has said it will grant the 27 million 
black majority the vote but it wants political protection for the 5 million 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept that the time may arise when a degree of compromise is needed," 
Slovo said. "But there is a limit -- and this is the gap that must be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't go to the negotiating table ready to abandon (the ANC's demand for) 
majority rule or forget that 90% of the productive property in this country is 
owned by whites," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A future South Africa without majority rule is a future South Africa in which 
we cannot touch the economic fruits of our country. It's just apartheid by 
another name." 
</P>
<P>
Until the government shows its willingness to meet the ANC's demands for 
negotiations, foreign governments should maintain their economic sanctions and 
diplomatic isolation of Pretoria, Slovo added. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be no reward yet for a country that still has all the main 
ingredients of apartheid," he said.

SOVIETS SHOT DOWN OWN JET IN 1960 U-2 INCIDENT

The Soviet army newspaper Red Star disclosed for the first time Sunday that 
when the Soviets downed Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy plane 30 years ago, they 
also destroyed one of their own fighters that was pursuing the American plane. 
</P>
<P>
The U-2 was downed on May 1, 1960, disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in 
Paris between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita S. 
Khrushchev and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned for later 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
Red Star also disclosed for the first time that the Soviets had sent up a new 
fighter plane and ordered its pilot to ram the U-2 on a suicide mission. The 
new fighter reached the U-2's altitude but failed to find it. 
</P>
<P>
Soviets hurrying to the May Day parade in the Ural Mountain city of Sverdlovsk 
saw what appeared to be fireworks high in the air, said the article, signed by 
a Col. A. Dokuchayev. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery debris was not fireworks but a Soviet MIG-19 that was hit by the same 
type of missile that exploded behind Power's U-2 and damaged it, Red Star said 
in the most detailed version of the Soviet military action. 
</P>
<P>
Powers' mission began in Pakistan and was to have carried him over Sverdlovsk 
for a landing in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
He used neither the automatic destruction device nor a poison pin he had been 
given in case the mission failed, and he was captured at a collective farm near 
Sverdlovsk. He was held for three years, then exchanged for the Soviet spy 
Rudolf Abel. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet article disclosed for the first time that the Soviets ordered a new 
Sukhoi 9 fighter, which was unarmed, to pursue the U-2, which operated at about 
70,000 feet, in an attempt to ram it. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also scrambled two MIG-19s, which were not capable of flying that 
high. The pilot of one MIG-19, Boris Ivazyan, reported to ground control that 
the debris from the U-2 was actually that from a missile that had missed the 
U-2, prompting the ground battery to fire another. 
</P>
<P>
The next Soviet missile struck the MIG-19 flown by Sergei Safronov, 30, who was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
Ivazyan survived and later married Safronov's widow. 
</P>
<P>
Powers died in August, 1977, when his Los Angeles traffic helicopter -- 
apparently out of fuel -- crashed in Encino.

LITHUANIANS REPORTED READY TO VOTE ON PLAN TO END BLOCKADE

The Lithuanian Parliament will vote this week on a compromise offer to try to 
end Moscow's economic blockade and open the way to negotiations on 
independence, an adviser to the republic's leadership said Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Antanas J. Buracas, a political economist and adviser to President Vytautas 
Landsbergis, said by telephone from the capital, Vilnius, that a compromise 
plan is being drafted for consideration by Parliament within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Soviet officials said that they will resume supplying 
natural gas to a major Lithuanian fertilizer plant, the first break in Moscow's 
two-week-old energy embargo. The decision was the latest of several signs of 
progress toward an end to the political stalemate that began March 11 with 
Lithuania's declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 10,000 people packed Cathedral Square in Vilnius late Sunday to hear 
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which Landsbergis has turned into the independence 
movement's unofficial anthem. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the performance, broadcast in towns and villages across the 
republic, the emotional crowd broke into shouts of "Lithuania! Lithuania!" 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
In the neighboring republic of Latvia, the nationalist Popular Front suffered a 
setback Sunday in key runoff elections, winning only four of the 17 remaining 
seats in the Latvian Parliament and falling short of the two-thirds majority 
needed for an aggressive secession campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The election, four days before Parliament is expected vote on independence for 
the Baltic republic, could determine whether Latvia follows Lithuania in a bid 
to break free from half a century of Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has warned Latvia and the third Baltic 
republic of Estonia that if they move rapidly to secede, they will face the 
same tough economic measures he has imposed in Lithuania.

10-MINUTE SPECIALS SELLING LIKE HOT CAKES

<TEXT>
<P>
In a world where everyone seems to be in a hurry, some businesses prosper 
simply by creating the image of providing speedier service -- rather than 
actually doing anything faster. 
</P>
<P>
Denny's Restaurants, for example, started advertising 10-minute breakfast and 
lunch specials nationally over the last six months, launching the service by 
highlighting the quick items that already were on its menu. 
</P>
<P>
It drives home the point with a further touch of marketing gimmickry, giving 
customers stopwatches to let them clock how long an order takes. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take anything that normally would take 12 minutes and tell people in 
restaurants, 'OK, guys, now you have to do it in 10 minutes,' " said Sue 
Henderson, the chain's vice president for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just making sure they deliver in 10 minutes and that people know they 
can go into Denny's and be served in 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The result: Denny's lunch and breakfast business, Henderson said, is up 
"significantly." STUART SILVERSTEIN

Homeless advocates who had occupied three federally owned homes for several 
days promised to take over other abandoned buildings after five people were 
arrested for investigation of trespassing. "We'll definitely be taking over 
other houses in Oakland," said Terry Messman, leader of the Oakland Union for 
the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Police raided three homes owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development to oust homeless activists who moved in five days earlier. "We feel 
HUD is the real criminal here," Messman said. The owners of the homes were 
evicted for non-payment of their mortgages. HUD, which had guaranteed the 
mortgages, took over ownership. Two of the residences were auctioned off. 
Messman said the homes should be turned over to the homeless.

TWO KILLED, TWO WOUNDED IN WEEKEND GUNFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were shot to death Sunday in separate incidents, and two other people 
were wounded by gunfire -- including a teen-age boy who was shot by a 
California Highway Patrol officer after being stopped in a car that allegedly 
had been stolen, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A gunman opened fire in the 600 block of South Alvarado Street near MacArthur 
Park, striking Jose Mejia, 31, once in the head, police said. He was pronounced 
dead at the scene, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
A 22-year-old man who was not identified was shot in the chest. He was listed 
in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were standing in front of a hamburger stand at 5:40 a.m. when a 
four-door black vehicle drove up, investigators said. As Mejia approached the 
car, a passenger sitting in the rear shot him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then got out of the car and chased the second victim, shooting him 
once in the chest. Investigators said they have no motive for the shooting and 
no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
A 32-year old man was shot and killed by apparent robbers as he fished with two 
friends on a jetty in Marina del Rey early Sunday, police said. Detectives said 
two assailants attempted to rob the victim, whose identity was not disclosed, 
and killed him during the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year old boy was shot and wounded by a CHP officer who had stopped the boy 
and a companion at Imperial Highway and Mariposa Avenue in an unincorporated 
area of Los Angeles County. Investigators said the boys were in a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded boy was shot in the head and was listed in critical but stable 
condition at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, a hospital spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to determine what happened," CHP spokesman Ernie Garcia said 
Sunday evening. "We have just started to interrogate everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The second boy was taken into custody, Garcia said. He did not disclose the 
charges.

Sacramento public works officials say they were just having some fun when they 
started a contest to find a non-sexist term for manholes. But since the word 
got out, people from Florida to Canada have been lighting up the City Hall 
switchboard. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them want to know about "the women who are taking over the City 
Council," said council receptionist Sibyl Winterberger, adding that most 
callers just made "lewd and offensive suggestions." Mayor Anne Rudin called it 
"a tempest in a manhole." Meanwhile, contest organizers said some "half-decent" 
suggestions for manhole replacements have come in. "We've got 'road hole,' 
'street hole,' 'confined space' and 'person entry and exit port,' " said senior 
engineer Randy Witt. "Some of them, though, just don't roll off the tongue the 
way 'manhole' does."

61 ARE ARRESTED IN PROSTITUTION SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested 61 people on sex charges in Hollywood over the weekend during a 
sweep spurred by complaints from neighborhood residents and merchants that the 
arrival of warmer weather had brought with it an increase in prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Vice officers booked 42 men and 13 women on charges of prostitution at a 
special command post set up behind the Hollywood police station, said Sgt. Brad 
Berman. 
</P>
<P>
"It always starts to build up in the spring and keeps going all the way to 
September," said Berman. "Everybody's kind of testing the waters, trying to see 
if we're still enforcing." 
</P>
<P>
A special task force, responding to numerous complaints from local business 
owners and residents about increasing prostitution, swept through the area 
between 5 p.m. Friday and 3:30 a.m. Saturday morning, said Berman. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 55 prostitution arrests, six people were booked on charges of lewd 
conduct for allegedly performing sex acts in public. 
</P>
<P>
Berman said the task force will continue to monitor activity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a lot of crimes based on weather," he said. "And the more activity 
we have, the more enforcement it is going to take." 
</P>
<P>
Officers also arrested one person during the sweep for interfering with police 
when he tried to warn prostitution suspects that undercover officers were in 
the area, Berman said.

Netter did not play tennis last summer and instead worked as a production 
assistant with his grandfather, Doug Netter, who owns a film production company 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
If film work interests Netter, his tennis fortunes are getting more of his 
attention. "I'm really into it now," he said. "This summer, it's going to be 
all tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Kronemann withstood a late rally to beat San Jose State's Mike 
Chinchiolo, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2), and lead UC Irvine to its fourth consecutive 
Big West men's title. 
</P>
<P>
Chinchiolo won four games in a row in the third set to erase a 5-2 deficit 
before Kronemann broke him at 6-5 to send the set into a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters won five of the nine flights to win the team title with 51 
points. Fresno State was second with 45 points. THOMAS BONK

MCGRATH LOSES AT OJAI, MAY LEAVE STANFORD

<P>
She's only a freshman at Stanford, but Meredith McGrath's stay in school may be 
as short her closely cropped blonde hair. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath is leaning toward turning professional. She has already played on the 
pro circuit, and has victories over Czechoslovakia's Jana Novotna and Italy's 
Raffaella Reggi while alternating Shakespeare class with serves. 
</P>
<P>
But if McGrath finds the Bard hard, it won't match the tempest she finds in the 
pros, according to Stanford Coach Frank Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids turn pro and if you hypnotize them six months later, invariably 
they'll say 'I'm not having that great a time. It's a job,' " Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all these kids should stay in school for four years," he said. "I just 
think these kids rush it. They rush by a great period in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath smiled when she learned of her coach's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"What did you expect him to say?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pacific 10 women's singles final at the Ojai Valley tennis 
tournament was an all-Stanford matchup between McGrath and sophomore Debbie 
Graham of Fountain Valley, who closed out a 6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 6-2 victory when 
McGrath double-faulted on match point. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, who turned 19 on Saturday, is No. 2 in Volvo Tennis/Collegiate 
rankings but plays No. 3 singles on the Stanford team behind No. 1-ranked 
Sandra Birch and 13th-ranked Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Graham defeated Birch in Saturday's semifinals and insisted she would not turn 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm finishing college," she said. "I feel like my game is 10 times better this 
year than last year." 
</P>
<P>
Graham said she plans to get her degree in political science or economics. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said she has not yet made up her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say I'm leaning one way or the other as far as staying in school or 
turning pro," she said, "but I'm turning over in my mind the advantage of each 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my game will hold up in the pros, but I definitely need a lot of work 
to make an impact in the pros, which I plan to do." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said how well she plays in the upcoming NCAA tournament will have no 
bearing on whether she turns pro. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan believes McGrath when she says she is still undecided, but seemed to 
think that McGrath was leaning toward the pros. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's still up in the air and I know it's getting down to it, but 
she's been great even if we only have her for one year," Brennan said.

CHESNOKOV BREAKS BANK WITH MONTE CARLO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, sprinting all over the court, downed 
Thomas Muster of Austria, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3, Sunday in the final of the Monte Carlo 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov picked up $125,000, the biggest paycheck of his career. Muster won 
$65,800. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big win and something I will remember for the rest of my life," said 
Chesnokov, ranked 20th in the world. "It is a great tournament and I think this 
is the biggest win for a Russian tennis player." 
</P>
<P>
Not only the most important, but also the most lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
"I already have the money in my pocket," Chesnokov said. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov has in the past been forced to split his winnings with the Soviet 
Federation, but after a tournament victory last year he said he would talk to 
officials about arranging a better deal between himself and his agents. 
According to his agents, Chesnokov now retains about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
It is considerably better than the $496 he collected on the $59,500 he won for 
the Orlando tournament in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov, seeded 12th, had little trouble against Muster after winning a long 
first set that lasted 70 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The first set was very tough," Chesnokov said. "I got more confidence after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Muster, ranked 30th in the world, was trying for his fifth tournament title 
since coming back to the circuit. Last April, he made the final of the 
International Players Championship, but was unable to play due to a leg injury 
after a car backed into him, causing knee damage. He was sidelined for more 
than six months. 
</P>
<P>
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain settled down after a shaky second-set start to 
beat Isabel Cueto of West Germany, 6-4, 6-2, in the final of the Spanish 
Women's International at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, the top-seeded player in the $150,000 tournament, held serve 
throughout the first set but faltered early in the second, giving up 
consecutive breaks to Cueto, who qualified for the final with an upset over 
Mary Joe Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
But Cueto, who appeared to hurt her left thigh early in the second set, failed 
to hold her serve even once, and double-faulted at break point to go down 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Pat Cash won his first tournament since an injury sidelined him 
eight months ago, beating Alex Antonitsch of Austria, 6-3, 6-4, in the Hong 
Kong Open. 
</P>
<P>
Cash had nine aces in the 80-minute match and scored repeatedly with strong 
attacks at the net that often left Antonitsch stranded on the wrong side of the 
court.

GYMNASTICS: EAST GERMANS SCORE TEAM VICTORY, BUT UNHERALDED NEBRASKAN STEALS 
THE SHOW.

<P>
The Americans lost to the East Germans in a men's gymnastics meet here Sunday, 
but for U.S. Gymnastics Federation officials, not all was lost. They found a 
new star. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Dimas, a 19-year-old freshman at the University of Nebraska, wasn't even 
invited to this meet. His coach at Nebraska, Francis Allen, pulled some strings 
to get him in. Then Dimas, unranked and unexpectedly good, beat the 10th-ranked 
gymnast in the world, East German Sylvio Kroll, to win the all-around title. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as happy now as I was when our team won the NCAA championship last week," 
Dimas said, referring to Nebraska's victory at Minnesota. "I wasn't even 
supposed to be at this meet, I wasn't invited." 
</P>
<P>
Dimas entered the last event, the high bar, trailing Kroll by .35 points. 
Kroll, East Germany's top gymnast in the meet, fell on his first release move 
and scored a 9.2. 
</P>
<P>
Dimas, the last gymnast to perform, stuck a flawless triple back-flip on his 
dismount to score a 9.8. and delight a crowd of 1,500 at the Mid-South 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Dimas finished with 57.75 points. Kroll had 57.50 and East German Andre Hempel 
57.25. UCLA's Chainey Umphrey, who was closing in on third place before the 
high bar, fell and finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Dimas won the high bar, scored a 9.75 on the parallel bars, a 9.6 on vault, a 
9.55 both on the rings and the pommel horse, and a 9.5 on floor. Nothing 
spectacular, just consistent. 
</P>
<P>
The United States won two events, the vault and the high bar, but could not 
keep up with East Germany, which won by 1.45 points, 284.80 to 283.35. To put 
this in perspective, however, the East Germans finished second to the Soviet 
Union at the 1989 World Championships. The United States tied for eighth. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany took the lead from the beginning, outscoring the United States by 
.60 points after the first event, the floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
But the pommel horse proved costly for the United States, which fell behind by 
1.95 points after Jeff Lutz and David St. Pierre each fell and scored 8.4 and 
8.85, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
A solid performance on the rings helped, but the United States was still 
outscored by .15 points. Umphrey scored the highest, 9.7, with a full-twisting, 
double-back flip dismount in a pike position. 
</P>
<P>
On the vault, the Americans outscored the East Germans to move to within 1.7 
points. Lutz earned a 9.75 with his Kasamatsu -- a cartwheel onto the vault -- 
with a 1 1/2 twist. 
</P>
<P>
Dimas, who performed a Yurchenko layout with a full twist, earned a 9.6. On a 
Yurchenko vault, a gymnast does a round-off onto the springboard, and a back 
handspring over the vault. It's a vault performed more by women than men, 
because the vault is turned lengthwise in men's gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
On the parallel bars, two falls by Lutz and Dominick Minicucci, who is coming 
back from an injury, put the United States behind by 2.9 points with only the 
high bar remaining. Even though the United States won the final event, it 
couldn't make up the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In the all-around, Lutz finished 10th and Minicucci finished last. 
</P>
<P>
Also competing for the United States was Mark Warburton, who finished fourth, 
and alternate Jarrod Hanks, who finished ninth.

STRAWBERRY FAILS TO GET CAMINITI'S FLY TO RIGHT, ASTROS EDGE METS, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On paper, the New York Mets have an outstanding team. They have tremendous 
pitching and are capable of scoring runs. 
</P>
<P>
It is on the field that the Mets leave something to be desired. They have 
committed 20 errors in 18 games. And there have been other misplays that have 
not been scored as errors. 
</P>
<P>
The defensive problems showed up Sunday at Houston in a pitching duel between 
Dwight Gooden and Mike Scott. The Astros won in the 10th inning when Darryl 
Strawberry played Ken Caminiti's drive to right field poorly and it went for a 
hit that beat the Mets, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
After Scott, a non-winner this year, and Gooden, who has won only once, pitched 
strong games, it was tied, 1-1, in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the bottom of the inning, Eric Yelding beat out a roller to 
shortstop Howard Johnson. One out later, Yelding stole second and continued to 
third when catcher Mackey Sasser threw the ball into center field. Reliever 
Julio Machado walked a batter and hit the next one to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Caminiti then hit a sinking fly ball to right. Strawberry didn't appear to get 
much of a jump. Then, instead of trying to make a diving catch, he lunged at 
the ball and the winning run scored. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Strawberry) got a bad jump on the ball," Manager Davey Johnson of the Mets 
told the Associated Press. "If the dive would have caught it I wish he had 
dived. Usually you don't dive unless you have a chance to catch it." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry thought the ball was well placed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get a bad jump, I gave it my best shot," he said. "I thought I had a 
shot at it, but it kept dropping. I was running full speed. It's a tough play 
to make a dive on." 
</P>
<P>
Caminiti was surprised to get the game-winning hit. "I didn't hit the ball all 
that well," he said. "I thought I was going to be out. I don't know if he could 
have dived and caught it. I'm just happy with the results." 
</P>
<P>
Scott gave up a run and four hits in seven innings in his best outing. Gooden, 
in his third fine outing in a row, gave up six hits in eight innings and struck 
out eight. 
</P>
<P>
The run Gooden gave up came on a single by Glenn Davis leading off the second 
and a triple to right-center by Rafael Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' run came in the sixth on a walk and singles by Strawberry and Kevin 
McReynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 10, San Diego 1 -- When the Pirates were going well a couple of 
years ago, the B-Boys, Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla, were providing the punch. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Pirates have rolled into first place in the East on a winning trip 
West, Bonds and Bonilla are at it again. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds hit a three-run home run to snap a tie in the fourth inning at San Diego 
and Bonilla hit his league-leading seventh home run. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek (4-1) went a strong six innings as the Pirates won their sixth in a 
row and improved to 12-2 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 9, St. Louis 7 -- Joe Magrane is supposed to be the best Cardinal 
pitcher. But, if it wasn't for John Tudor's surprising comeback, the Cardinals 
would really be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane gave up six runs and eight hits and was gone with none out in the third 
inning and remained winless in four decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In some of his starts, Magrane hasn't gotten much offensive support. But in 
this game at San Francisco, the Cardinals got 10 hits off Rick Reuschel (2-1) 
and knocked him out in the eighth. But it still left them a little short. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero had four hits, two RBIs, and scored twice for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 3, Philadelphia 1 -- The Braves, despite their slow start, have been 
getting pretty good pitching. And Pete Smith won this one at Atlanta by 
pitching their first complete game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith (2-1) gave up six hits and became the winner when Jim Presley hit a 
two-run home run in the sixth. It ended the Braves' five-game losing streak and 
was their third win in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Cincinnati 3 -- The Reds' run of good luck ended in this game at 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Danny Jackson, on his fourth pitch, was hit on the left arm by a 
smash off the bat of Junior Noboa and had to leave the game. X-rays revealed no 
broken bone. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach and Mike Fitzgerald hit home runs as the Expos hammered four 
relievers for six runs and 10 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gross, who had walked 15 batters in 18 innings this season, walked only 
two in 7 1/3 innings and gave up six hits to improve his record to 2-1. DAN

HARKEY KEEPS MAKING HIS BEST PITCH; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE FORMER CAL STATE FULLERTON STAR HAS OVERCOME INJURIES TO EARN A 
SPOT IN THE CHICAGO CUBS' ROTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Signs of the old Mike Harkey, the one who dazzled baseball scouts during his 
days at Cal State Fullerton, the one who breezed through the Chicago Cubs' 
minor league system as if he was the next Bob Gibson, are beginning to 
re-emerge. 
</P>
<P>
His fastball is lighting up radar guns around the National League, as the San 
Diego Padres discovered in his most recent start. Harkey held the Padres 
hitless for seven innings in the Cubs' 3-1 victory last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey is injury-free once again. There's a smile on his face and more spring 
to his step. He's fun to be around. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always laughing and he's as loud as ever, just like he was in the minor 
leagues," said Cub catcher Joe Girardi, who caught Harkey in double A and 
roomed with him for a month in triple A. 
</P>
<P>
Just being part of a major league starting rotation for the first time would be 
reason enough for such giddiness from a 23-year-old rookie. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a lot more to it in Harkey's case. When you have been humbled as 
Harkey was in 1989 -- when your once-meteoric career takes a nose dive, bottoms 
out, and you bounce back and land in the major leagues, there is all the more 
reason to be chipper. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it here in the big leagues," said Harkey. "I want to be here all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Harkey wasn't sure he would ever make it. 
</P>
<P>
When the Cubs made Harkey their first-round pick -- the fourth player chosen 
overall -- in the 1987 June draft, they vowed not to rush him to the major 
leagues. But the way Harkey was pitching, there was no sense in holding him 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey made 12 starts at Class-A Peoria (Ill.) that summer, going 2-3 with a 
3.55 earned-run average, and closed the season with an appearance at double-A 
Pittsfield (Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
He split the 1988 season between Pittsfield, where he was 9-2 with a 1.37 ERA, 
and triple-A Iowa, where he was 7-2 with a 3.55 ERA. The Cubs called up Harkey 
in September and he made five starts, going 0-3 but impressing the club with a 
2.60 ERA and his ability. 
</P>
<P>
Cub Manager Don Zimmer told writers at the time that Harkey would be in his 
rotation come 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a bad statement," Zimmer admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Zimmer said he might have put too much pressure on Harkey. But to 
pin Harkey's 1989 calamity on Zimmer wouldn't be fair. Harkey, a 6-foot-5, 
220-pound right-hander, bears the blame. 
</P>
<P>
Early in spring training, he developed tendinitis in his throwing shoulder, but 
he didn't tell anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to work it out by myself," said Harkey, a 1984 graduate of Ganesha 
High School in Pomona. "I tried to throw through it, and that only made it 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Harkey pitched poorly throughout spring training, and he lost some velocity on 
his fastball, normally clocked in the 90-m.p.h. range. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't the Harkey I knew," Zimmer said. "I couldn't take him to Chicago 
throwing 82 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Late in spring training, Harkey confessed, telling his coaches about his 
shoulder problems. The organization sent him back to Iowa, where Harkey met 
more misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
After three weeks on the disabled list, Harkey tried to come back, but was not 
at full strength. He was 2-7 with a 4.43 ERA in 12 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on June 25, Harkey tore cartilage in his right knee during a game at 
Syracuse. He underwent surgery on July 27 and missed the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in his baseball career, spanning high school, college and 
the pros, Harkey had flopped. And that didn't sit too well with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went so smoothly for him the year before," Girardi said. "He had to 
understand that being a major league player wasn't success 100% of the time. 
You learn to go through periods where you struggle. I'm not sure he ever had to 
struggle before." 
</P>
<P>
Harkey doesn't wince when he recalls 1989. "It only would have been painful if 
it had been a career-ending injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned you can't take anything for granted," said Harkey, who is married 
and has an 18-month-old son. "In this game, anything can change in the blink of 
an eye. There are some people who think they have this game licked, and all of 
a sudden it turns on them. You have to be ready for anything, because anything 
can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Four months after his operation, Harkey was playing winter ball in Venezuela, 
where he pitched 50 innings in two months with no pain. He came to spring 
training in March with a healthy body and a sound mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to get my confidence back during winter ball," Harkey said. "I 
found out I was completely healthy and ready to go. When I had my velocity from 
Day 1, I knew I could pitch in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Harkey pitched well enough during the shortened spring to earn a spot on the 
major league roster and was projected as a long reliever. But when Rick 
Sutcliffe went on the 21-day disabled list with a shoulder injury, Zimmer 
inserted Harkey into the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
In three starts, Harkey is 2-1 with a 2.60 ERA. He turned in his best 
performance Thursday, taking a no-hitter into the eighth inning before Phil 
Stephenson led off with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer then pulled Harkey in favor of Mitch Williams, who retired the Padres in 
the eighth and ninth innings to help the Cubs end a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still getting his feet on the ground, but I think you'll see a big 
improvement in him by the All-Star break," Zimmer said. "This is the first time 
he has ever been in a big league rotation, and we're not looking for miracles. 
As the season goes, he'll get better and better." 
</P>
<P>
Harkey isn't expecting results overnight. Just as the Cubs appear to be showing 
patience with him -- allowing him to live and learn on the major league level 
this season -- Harkey has shown patience in himself. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be days when I'll walk a few and have lapses in concentration," 
Harkey said. "But the ability to be a big-leaguer is being able to bounce 
back."

SUNS FIND CURE FOR WHAT AILS THEM; 
</P>
<P>
NBA PLAYOFFS: KEVIN JOHNSON MAKES A RAPID RECOVERY FROM STOMACH CRAMPS FOR 39 
STRONG MINUTES AS PHOENIX ROLLS OVER UTAH AND EVENS FIRST-ROUND SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SALT LAKE CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The question is whether Kevin Johnson did more good for the Phoenix Suns or the 
gelatin industry Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is for sure, though. Johnson, returning to full duty from a viral 
infection, and the Suns, returning to the series, chewed up the Utah Jazz like 
soft food, winning, 105-87, before 12,616 at the Salt Palace to even the 
best-of-five first-round matchup at one game each. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory by a road team in 16 NBA playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
"A little sore and winded," Johnson said afterward, offering his own medical 
update, "but victories cure you in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Medically speaking, this was no miracle remedy that enabled him to play 39 
minutes after going only nine in the opener Friday. Mothers everywhere would 
endorse it, and team doctors obviously did, too, because they headed the search 
committee the day before to find the healing potion. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Steingard tracked down lemon chicken soup at a Greek restaurant. His 
son Scott, also a team physician, went to a convenience store to pick up the 
Jell-O Johnson wanted for his liquid diet. Strawberry flavor. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the hotel kitchen said they didn't make special requests for guests. 
But when one of the workers found out it was for Johnson, Jell-O it was. Next 
thing anyone knew, Johnson woke up Sunday feeling much better and hours later 
was in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz couldn't have seen this coming? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably not," Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said. "But you'd better expect 
it. If Kevin's got the ball, you'd better expect the worst for your team." 
</P>
<P>
Utah didn't get the worst -- Johnson had seven turnovers, compared with seven 
assists. But opening at about 75% and getting stronger as the game progressed, 
he scored a game-high 22 points, and made up for any mistakes he made by simply 
playing. It was a better endorsement than Bill Cosby could ever have done, 
especially in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"We just went out there with more confidence," Phoenix's Kurt Rambis said. 
"That's not a knock on the players running the show the other night, but we're 
used to a certain routine." 
</P>
<P>
Beating Utah, for one thing, with the Suns holding a 4-2 advantage this season. 
The two losses here, Dec. 13 and Friday, came when Johnson, in order, sat out 
with a strained hamstring and made only a cameo appearance because of stomach 
cramps. Wednesday, the series moves to Phoenix, where the Jazz have lost nine 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Utah was in this one for all of one quarter. The Jazz was already down, 35-21, 
40 seconds into the second quarter, a deficit that would reach 19, 64-45, early 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
That soon went to 23, 78-55, with 2:17 remaining in the third quarter, and, 
finally, 24, 82-58, with 1:18 left when Johnson whipped a pass underneath that 
Kenny Battle converted into a layup. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychologically, it was big," Fitzsimmons said of Johnson's play. "But the 
important thing was knowing we got kicked every which way but loose (in Game 
1)." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, this was about saving face for the Suns after dropping the 
opener by 17, and Fitzsimmons made sure they knew that. He asked several 
players to look into the mirror in the visitors' locker room before taking the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"We watched the films from Friday night and decided that no matter what 
happens, whether we had Kevin or not, we were going to come out and play 
tonight," Tom Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers wasn't much help on the court, though. Like Utah's star forward, Karl 
Malone, Chambers struggled through his second consecutive poor offensive 
showing, making only two of 12 shots. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the only real debit on a team that made 49.4% of its attempts, 
including 52.5% in the first half, when the game was decided. With Johnson 
going seven of 14 and Jeff Hornacek connecting on seven of 12 shots, the Suns' 
starting backcourt outscored their Utah counterparts, John Stockton and Bobby 
Hansen, 38-23. 
</P>
<P>
In all, six Phoenix players reached double figures. Mark West, who had 14, also 
contributed a season-high 21 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Malone looked the part of the sick player, or at least his game did: seven of 
21, with one-of-six shooting in the second half, 20 points before fouling out 
after 39 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
He'll take the two-day layoff and the change of climate. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and the Suns? Their status has been upgraded, the point guard and the 
team. Both recovered nicely together.

The 43rd Newport-to-Ensenada Yacht Race dragged to a close Sunday at 11 a.m. 
when Windspun drifted across the finish line, the last to finish at Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
The race started Friday at noon at Newport Beach and was the most windless race 
from start to finish in the history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
When it was all over, 321 of the 508 starters made the finish line. Officially 
there were 178 who did not complete the race. Nine were unaccounted for Sunday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Yacht Concert, a 44-foot sloop skippered by Joe Melaso of Dana Point, went 
aground off Point Nigel, north of Ensenada, Sunday morning. Melaso said he was 
coming to Ensenada under power and lost their engine. The crew went to shore 
and no injuries were reported. ALMON LOCKABEY

LATVIA NATIONALISTS FALL SHORT, WIN ONLY 4 OF 17 RUNOFF SEATS

The nationalist Popular Front suffered a setback Sunday in key runoff 
elections, winning only four of the 17 remaining seats in the Latvian 
Parliament and falling short of the two-thirds majority needed for an 
aggressive secession campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The election, four days before Parliament's expected vote on independence for 
the Baltic republic, could determine whether Latvia follows neighboring 
Lithuania in a bid to break free from half a century of Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
Imants Ziedonis, a Latvian poet and head of the Latvian Cultural Foundation, 
said before the voting that the nationalists had to take control of Parliament 
to stop "the Russian elephant that is stomping on the Baltic anthill." 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian Popular Front claims it won 124 places in the republic's 201-seat 
Supreme Soviet in the first round of voting March 18 and needed to add 10 of 17 
remaining spots in the runoff to gain a clear two-thirds majority necessary to 
proclaim independence when the new Parliament opens Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But results announced on Latvian television late Sunday showed the Popular 
Front winning only four seats, with other candidates taking 11. One race was 
too close to call, and a second runoff was necessary in another district 
because neither candidate drew more than half the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has warned Latvia and Estonia that if 
they move rapidly to secede, they will face the same tough economic measures he 
has imposed in Lithuania, the third Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian Popular Front has vowed to defy Gorbachev and push through an 
independence proclamation soon after the new Parliament convenes May 3.

THE LAST 30 HOURS OF SAIGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HAGIHARA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 10, 1975, the North Vietnamese army launched what would turn out to be 
its last offensive against the South, sending more than 100,000 troops down the 
Ho Chi Minh Trail. In two days, the army was able to take Ban Me Thuot in the 
Central Highlands. By the end of March, the North Vietnamese army entered Da 
Nang unopposed, triggering an airlift of Americans and South Vietnamese. On 
April 27, 16 divisions of North Vietnamese troops began their final assault on 
South Vietnam's capital. What follows is a chronology of the last, desperate 30 
hours before the fall of Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
APRIL 29 
</P>
<P>
3:45 a.m. Saigon is awakened by the thunder of Communist rockets and 
130-millimeter artillery fire pounding Tan Son Nhut Air Base at the edge of the 
city. Saigon has been under siege for two days, with 16 divisions of North 
Vietnamese troops -- about 150,000 soldiers in all -- encircling the capital in 
an ever-tightening stranglehold. The shelling of Tan Son Nhut halts the airlift 
already in progress and makes a swift and orderly evacuation virtually 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the Soviet-made SA-3 rockets explodes next to the U.S. defense 
attache office, killing two U.S. Marines, Lance Cpl. Darwin L. Judge of 
Marshalltown, Iowa, and Cpl. Charles McMahon Jr. of Woburn, Mass. They are the 
last Americans to die on South Vietnamese soil. A C-130 transport plane is 
destroyed as its pilot tries to lift off through the barrage of incoming 
artillery fire, but the crew and passengers manage to escape. 
</P>
<P>
From the sanctuary of the Continental Palace Hotel, Western correspondents 
monitor an account of the attack over a radio frequency used by the U.S. 
mission: "The ICCS (International Commission for Control and Supervision) is 
burning. . . . The back of the gymnasium has been hit. . . . My God, we've got 
two Marine KIAs (killed in action)." 
</P>
<P>
Another report comes in: Communist forces are beginning a ground assault in the 
outskirts of Saigon, with the heaviest fighting reported along Highway 1 less 
than 10 miles from the western edge of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
9 a.m. The horizon is dotted with South Vietnamese helicopters heading out to 
sea, where a convoy of 40 U.S. rescue ships are on standby 200 miles from 
Saigon in the South China Sea. Five Vietnamese helicopters and two Air America 
choppers descend on the Blue Ridge, the command ship of the rescue fleet. One 
of the Air America helicopters lands first, then a Vietnamese Chinook 
helicopter sets down almost on top of it, the propellers of the two aircraft 
clanging together, disintegrating, sending jagged pieces of metal across the 
flight deck. The doors of the Chinook open, and women clutching crying children 
emerge. Sailors shove the disabled aircraft over the side so that other 
helicopters can land. Pilots are told to ditch their helicopters into the sea. 
Some perform amazing feats of aerobatics. One takes his Chinook up to about 100 
feet, pushes the stick to the left, then leaps out the right side. 
</P>
<P>
9:54 a.m. The shelling of Tan Son Nhut has subsided. Two American C-130s circle 
high above the air base, their pilots requesting permission to land. Gen. Homer 
Smith, head of the U.S. defense attache office, sends word to the pilots to 
descend to 16,000 feet and prepare for landing in 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
10:10 a.m. Smith radioes Adm. Noel Gayler, commander in chief of the Pacific 
Fleet, with a disturbing report that sets off alarms all the way in Washington, 
where members of the National Security Council are monitoring radio 
transmissions from Saigon. The situation at Tan Son Nhut is getting out of 
control, Smith reports. There is a near-riot on the runways, which have been 
flooded by panic-stricken crowds. A Vietnamese-operated C-130 has been 
abandoned on one of the runways with its engine still running. Another C-130 is 
being blocked from taking off by a jeep. Smith says that all hope of landing 
any more C-130s is lost. Any evacuation, he says, will have to be carried out 
by helicopter. The two C-130s circling above the air base are told to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Graham Martin receives word from South Vietnamese President Duong 
Van (Big) Minh that the Americans have 24 hours to leave the country. Martin 
then recommends to Washington that "Option 4" be implemented. This refers to a 
section of the contingency plan headed "(IV) Helicopter Extraction." The first 
three options involve evacuation by fixed-wing aircraft and hinge on Tan Son 
Nhut being open. Evacuation by helicopter is considered the option of last 
resort because of the greater risks involved. Ironically, the very people the 
first three options hoped to save, including thousands of South Vietnamese long 
associated with the Americans, have thronged on the runways and are preventing 
the planes from landing. 
</P>
<P>
10:51 a.m. Word finally arrives from Washington: Begin Operation Frequent Wind. 
An announcer on American Radio Services sends out the prearranged Mayday 
signal. "It is 105 degrees and rising," he says. His music selection is "White 
Christmas" by Bing Crosby. It is broadcast, along with the "weather report," at 
15-minute intervals. That message sends the last remaining Americans to 13 
landing zones throughout the downtown district. The landing zones are all atop 
American-owned or -operated buildings. Meanwhile, waves of F-4 fighter bombers 
take off from American bases in Thailand to provide air cover for the 
helicopters. In addition to the 40 U.S. rescue ships in the South China Sea, 
there are 6,000 Marines, 120 Air Force combat and tanker planes and 150 Navy 
planes to help in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Noon As word of the evacuation spreads through the streets of Saigon, America's 
30-year involvement in the Indochina war begins its tumultuous, surrealistic 
end. At the American Embassy's main gate, grim-faced Marines in full battle 
gear use rifle butts to smash the fingers of those among the panic-stricken 
crowd trying to climb the 10-foot-high walls. Some people try to jump the wall 
and land on the barbed wire. Others clear the wall, only to be thrown back 
outside. Mothers hold up their children, pleading with the Americans to take 
them. 
</P>
<P>
At the central post office, crowds of people claw their way to the telegram 
counter. Cable traffic quadruples to 20,000 messages as the pleas for help get 
sent out across the globe. Western correspondents gather at Saigon's main 
hotels, from which they are led to various landing zones. Some correspondents, 
however, elect to remain behind. 
</P>
<P>
An abandoned American bowling alley becomes a makeshift waiting room for 
thousands of South Vietnamese desperate to leave the country. A sign on the 
wall provides an eerie notion for these frantic, desperate moments: "Tat tat ca 
den, may lanh va quat khi ra ve," it says, "Turn off the lights, air 
conditioners and fans when leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the city's main thoroughfares are jammed with vehicles of all types 
-- bicycles, pedicabs, motorbikes, taxis, small trucks -- anything that can 
roll. The hot, humid Saigon air is blue with exhaust fumes as the procession of 
motor vehicles zooms endlessly past abandoned sidewalk cafes. Many families 
huddle in their homes, afraid of what will happen when North Vietnamese troops 
finally arrive. Not everyone is gripped by fear, however. Some merchants have 
already begun stocking the black uniforms favored by the Viet Cong. 
</P>
<P>
1:00 p.m. The first of the American helicopters passes over the American 
Embassy to a tennis court at the U.S. defense attache office next to Tan Son 
Nhut Air Base. Landing two at a time, the helicopters disgorge squads of 
Marines -- 860 in all -- to reinforce the 125 Marines already at the scene. The 
helicopters quickly pick up a load of evacuees and leave. Angry Vietnamese 
guards fire in the air and at the evacuees, shouting, "We want to go too." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day and night, wave upon wave of American helicopters swoop down 
on the capital, pluck evacuees off the landing zones and ferry them 200 miles 
out to the rescue fleet. Chaos lurks around every corner as the capital is 
enveloped by panic and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
The Saigon River provides an escape route for countless evacuees who take boats 
down to the port of Vung Tau, where hundreds of ships are jammed with refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Vietnamese air force stages its own evacuation. Planes 
pour into Utapao Air Base, a U.S.-run facility about 110 miles southeast of 
Bangkok. By nightfall, 74 planes bring in 2,000 Vietnamese civilians and 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
6 p.m. Helicopters land at the U.S. Embassy compound, bringing in Marine 
reinforcements. There are two landing zones at the compound -- the embassy 
roof, which can withstand the weight of a CH-46 and its 20 passengers, and the 
parking lot, where the larger CH-53s will each pick up 50 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, the evacuation at Tan Son Nhut has been accomplished, but the 
rescue operation at the embassy continues. Sheets of rain pelt the city, and 
visibility drops to a mile or less. Some helicopter pilots rely on flares fired 
by Marines within the embassy compound to guide them to the landing zones. 
Others home in on flashlights. Waves of helicopters arrive and leave 10 minutes 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the compound, the Vietnamese crowd grows uglier. Floor by floor, the 
Marines retreat toward the roof of the embassy, followed by looters. Abandoned 
offices are transformed into junkyards of smashed office equipment and 
ransacked file cabinets. Marines barricade the doors leading to the roof. The 
evacuation at the embassy continues through the long night. 
</P>
<P>
APRIL 30 
</P>
<P>
4:30 a.m. Ambassador Martin is the last American official to leave. Tempers are 
frayed, both in Washington and Saigon. Martin has drawn up a list of about 500 
Vietnamese to be evacuated and has refused to leave until they are all safely 
gone. He is on the phone to Washington, asking permission to extend the 
deadline for the evacuation. Finally, a young pilot strides into Martin's 
office and hands the ambassador a scrawled message. "The President of the 
United States directs Ambassador Martin to come out on this helicopter." Martin 
puts down the phone, walks up to the chopper and flies out. Only a contingent 
of about 30 Marines remains. 
</P>
<P>
By dawn, the streets of the City of Sorrows are deserted. 
</P>
<P>
7:53 a.m. The Marines huddle on the embassy roof and wait for a chopper. Firing 
a red smoke grenade, they guide in a CH-46 helicopter. As it touches down, the 
Marines scramble aboard, completing the evacuation of 900 Americans and about 
5,000 Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
10:24 a.m. South Vietnamese President Minh, who has been in power less than a 
week, surrenders unconditionally. "The Republic of Vietnam policy is the policy 
of peace and reconciliation, aimed at saving the blood of our people," he says 
in a five-minute radio broadcast. "We are here waiting for the Provisional 
Revolutionary Government to hand over the authority in order to stop useless 
bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
11:05 a.m. Tank No. 879 of the First Battalion of the People's Liberation Armed 
Forces bursts open the gates of the Presidential Palace. There is little 
resistance from the palace guards. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Bui Tin, the ranking officer of the People's Liberation army in the 
capital, accepts Minh's surrender. Referring to the celebratory gunfire 
outside, Tin says: "You have nothing to fear. Between Vietnamese, there are no 
victors and no vanquished. Only the Americans have been beaten. If you are 
patriots, consider this a moment of joy. The war for our country is over." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evacuation Under Fire 
</P>
<P>
1. On April 29, North Vietnamese troops launch a pre-dawn rocket attack on Tan 
Son Nhut Air Base, triggering a massive helicopter evacuation of Americans and 
South Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
2. Wave upon wave of helicopters swoop down on Saigon to pluck evacuees from 
rooftops while fighters fly air cover. Thousands of refugees flee by boat on 
the Saigon River to the SouthChina Sea, where American rescue ships are on 
standby. 
</P>
<P>
3. By dawn of April 30, about 900 Americans and 5,000 Vietnamese have been 
airlifted out of the city. The South Vietnamese government surrenders 
unconditionally at 10:24 a.m.

INVESTIGATION: NOW THAT MICHAEL ANTHONY RIZZITELLO 'IS OUT OF THE WAY,' 
AUTHORITIES SAY THEY CAN CONCENTRATE ON TWO STILL UNSOLVED MURDERS AND THE 
ARSON FIRE THAT BROUGHT THE CLUB DOWN.

<TEXT>
<P>
The cavernous Mustang Club on Harbor Boulevard was once a bar owner's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Every night, a mix of coat-and-tie yuppies, beer-bellied bikers and off-duty 
soldiers crowded around a horseshoe-shaped bar, attracted by the loud rock 
music and the topless dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"The money was just pouring in," said one law enforcement official. 
</P>
<P>
But with success came violence. The club's profits may have been the catalyst 
for a 15-month period in which the Mustang's first manager and one of its 
bouncers were murdered, its major investor blinded and left for dead, and the 
club itself torched and burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the sentencing of a major Los Angeles organized crime figure two 
weeks ago for his role in the violence, still unsolved are the two murders and 
the arson, and law enforcement officials are still searching for answers. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles racketeer Michael Anthony Rizzitello, 62, considered by organized 
crime experts the most violent member of the Milano crime family, was sentenced 
to 33 years in prison for the near-fatal shooting of C. William Carroll, the 
Mustang's chief financial backer. Rizzitello "gopher" Joseph Angelo Grosso, 46, 
is serving a 26-year-to-life prison term for helping him in the Carroll hit. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that Rizzitello wanted to muscle in on the Mustang's 
profits and tried to remove Carroll, who he believed would resist those plans. 
But still unsolved are: 
</P>
<P>
* The murder of Jimmy Lee Casino, 48, the club's originator and first manager, 
shot three times in the head at his Buena Park home on New Year's Day, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* Two arson fires, the last one demolishing the club on Jan. 16, 1988. One man 
has been convicted in the arson cases. But investigators believe he was a hired 
hand, and while they have an unnamed suspect as the mastermind, no other 
arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
* The murder of George (Big George) Yudzevich, 46, the club's liaison with 
organized crime, found shot to death March 3, 1988, in an Irvine industrial 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that Rizzitello is out of the way, we can concentrate our manpower on 
these other cases," one law enforcement official said. "We're going to take a 
harder look than ever at what was going on at that club." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang began when Casino convinced investors that a topless bar in Orange 
County would be a moneymaker, according to testimony and evidence presented at 
the Rizzitello and Grosso trials. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, a real estate investor and financier who once served a prison term for 
fraud, became Casino's major benefactor, eventually providing about $200,000, 
court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Casino was as flamboyant as he was quick to make enemies. But he knew how to 
run a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang thrived, even as Casino outmaneuvered the Santa Ana officials who 
tried repeatedly to shut the club. The club officially became a theater after 
Casino persuaded a judge that it was more than just a topless bar. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the profits, Casino was beset by money troubles. He somehow could 
not pay off all of his loans. And his troubles mounted when federal officials 
claimed in 1986 that he owed unpaid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
He secured a five-figure loan from Carroll, who demanded that should Casino 
default, Carroll would essentially gain control of the club's operation. And 
Casino defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to his Buena Park home with his girlfriend after a New Year's Eve 
party in 1987 to find two gunmen waiting. They escorted the couple into the 
house. The woman was raped. Casino was shot three times in the head, and died. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the shooting, Rizzitello sought out Carroll, who had assumed a more 
active role at the club. Rizzitello proposed several business ventures, which 
Carroll resisted, according to testimony at both the Rizzitello and Grosso 
trials. Carroll said he did eventually loan Rizzitello $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Carroll was not happy about the club's operation. Grosso and 
Yudzevich, who both had ties to Rizzitello and were regular visitors to the 
club, upset him the most. Carroll testified that he learned they were selling 
cocaine at the club to some of the dancers, and he tried to get the new 
manager, Gene Lesher, to throw them out. Yudzevich, at 6 feet, 7 inches and 
more than 350 pounds, eventually became a club bouncer, and Grosso an 
occasional driver for Carroll. Grosso also sold lingerie to the dancers in the 
$10,000 business arrangement between Carroll and Rizzitello. 
</P>
<P>
In April of 1987, someone took a shot at Carroll on Harbor Boulevard after he 
left the club. Several weeks later, on April 30, Carroll and Rizzitello met at 
Emilia's restaurant in Santa Ana. Carroll wanted to talk about the lack of 
return on his $10,000 loan, and Rizzitello had said he would help find out who 
had shot at Carroll. Grosso was present. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll testified that the two used a ruse to persuade him to accompany them to 
a vacant parking garage near the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, where 
Rizzitello shot him three times in the head while Grosso held him down. 
</P>
<P>
"We never discussed anything at the dinner that would lead me to believe I was 
heading for trouble," Carroll said in an interview last week. "It was strictly 
an ambush." 
</P>
<P>
According to Carroll's testimony, Rizzitello told him before firing the 
.38-caliber handgun: "This is for not letting us eat." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll was shot three times in the head. He was saved after emergency surgery, 
but was left permanently blind. For 18 months, he refused to say who fired the 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
During those 18 months, Carroll has since testified, he was repeatedly 
threatened by Rizzitello, through other agents who told him he would be killed 
if he told who had shot him. 
</P>
<P>
One of the calls came from Yudzevich, who admitted to Carroll that he had 
gotten rid of the gun and the bloody clothes for Rizzitello and Grosso. Carroll 
said Yudzevich apologized for having anything to do with the attack. 
</P>
<P>
But to others, Yudzevich boasted about his role. 
</P>
<P>
"Big George wanted people to know he was a stand-up guy; look what he had done 
for Rizzitello," one law enforcement official said. 
</P>
<P>
With Carroll out of the picture, Mustang manager Lesher became an easy target 
for Rizzitello, according to prosecutors. Lesher, fearful for his life, 
testified that he caved in to the veiled threats of Rizzitello, who he said 
wanted to take over the club. Yudzevich was the man Rizzitello put there to 
collect his share -- $5,000 a week in money skimmed from profits which was 
never accounted for to the government for tax purposes, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Yudzevich continued to act as collector, despite the fact that he had testified 
against former organized crime associates in a New York investigation. 
Yudzevich had spent time in the federal witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
Fires closed the Mustang at the end of 1987. Three months later, on March 12, 
1988, Yudzevich's huge frame was found sprawled on the pavement near the trunk 
of his Cadillac in the parking lot of a linen factory on Mitchell Street in 
Irvine. Late at night, he had been shot three times in the head while sitting 
in the driver's seat of his car, but managed to get out before dying. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, Carroll finally agreed to cooperate with authorities. He had 
waited, he said, until a bank fraud case pending against him was resolved as a 
misdemeanor with no jail sentence. Carroll said he feared Rizzitello would have 
had him killed in the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Casino, Yudzevich and Carroll were all shot in a similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
But were they all shot by the same person? The police aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Police say there is only one primary suspect in the Yudzevich shooting -- 
Rizzitello. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Yudzevich was hiding from the former organized crime 
associates he had testified against. He lived in a motel but stayed primarily 
in his car, where he kept most of his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Meir J. Westreich, Carroll's attorney, said at a news conference last week that 
what most law enforcement officials involved are privately convinced of is 
true. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only one man who could have convinced Big George to drive down to a 
place like that at night," Westreich said. 
</P>
<P>
That was his former roommate and his best friend, Joey Grosso, law enforcement 
officials believe. And Grosso, authorities theorize, only did what Rizzitello 
directed. 
</P>
<P>
After the Yudzevich shooting, Grosso was interviewed by The Times about his 
friend's death. 
</P>
<P>
"When you testify in court against known killers, it's crazy, mind-boggling 
that he did not stay in that protection program," Grosso said. 
</P>
<P>
But Grosso's logic has not impressed authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Big George and Joey were just like those two characters (Lennie and George) in 
'Of Mice and Men,' " one official said. "Nobody, but nobody, could have set up 
Big George except Joey." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are convinced that Rizzitello was upset that Yudzevich was telling 
too many people about the Carroll shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Before Grosso's sentencing last December for his role in the Carroll shooting, 
Grosso tried to negotiate a deal. News reports speculated then that prosecutors 
wanted Grosso to testify against Rizzitello. But prosecutors wanted Grosso to 
talk about the Yudzevich murder. He refused, and the Yudzevich case is still 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
As sure as some of the authorities are about who killed Yudzevich, that's how 
unsure they are who killed Casino. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now there is no one single suspect in the Casino killing," one law 
enforcement official said. "Rizzitello may have decided to use Casino to make 
his mark, to say, 'I'm here; you have to deal with me.' But there are others 
too who could have done it. You have to untangle that whole thing about the 
Mustang's operation." 
</P>
<P>
One police report early in the Casino murder investigation named Carroll as a 
"prime suspect," evidence stressed by the Rizzitello defense. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors have pointed out that everyone involved with Casino at that 
time was considered a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has steadfastly denied any involvement in the Casino killing. And 
prosecutors have publicly stated Carroll is not a suspect in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll acknowledged during his testimony that the Mustang was a success. But 
in a news conference after the Rizzitello sentencing, Carroll said he regrets 
the day he heard the club's name. He lost about $90,000 in the Mustang, and 
nearly lost his life. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part, Carroll said, was coping with his blindness. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time I kept saying: 'Why me? Why me?' Then finally I woke up one 
morning and said to myself, 'It is you. And that's the way it's always going to 
be.' "

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: VIETNAM IS STILL A BAD DREAM, 19 YEARS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend recommended the movie "Born on the Fourth of July," so I almost saw 
it. But I didn't. I started to check out "The Deer Hunter" at a video store but 
put it back at the last minute. "Apocalypse Now" and "Platoon" -- I just can't 
watch them. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest of all is "China Beach" on television. It makes too painful the 
memories of the real China Bay. Its majestic beauty and pure sand shoreline 
were so anomalous to the ravages of conflict just a few miles away in Da Nang, 
whose million-plus people had never known a day without war. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 19 years since I left Da Nang, a sprawling mass of refugee 
compounds in South Vietnam. I was an Army newspaper reporter with a cushy job 
in an air-conditioned office. I never once saw combat or even a Viet Cong. But 
for the life of me, I can't figure out why it still affects me so. 
</P>
<P>
You know people who, years after college, still have nightmares about going to 
class unprepared for a big test? For 19 years I've dreamed the Army wanted me 
back -- and back in Vietnam. A week ago was something of a breakthrough. That 
dream had me back in Da Nang but as a civilian. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe my anxiety is that the movies will reinforce the empty feeling I've 
always had, that it was all such a waste. 
</P>
<P>
I was at an Army signal battalion compound on the Air Force base. It was 1971 
and most of the fighting was over. The only time any of us heard from the Viet 
Cong was during the once-a-week rocket attacks, usually on Sunday nights. A 
dozen rockets spread out over the size of the American military base was no 
more dangerous to us individually than traveling Orange County freeways in a 
light rain. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, we actually looked forward to rockets. It was the only thing that 
brought us together. 
</P>
<P>
Our little compound was an explosive mix of drug dealing, troop irreverence and 
racial tension. Like many white soldiers, my greatest fear was being in the way 
of friction between the military brass and the black soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Few whites were sensitive to the exclusion that so many blacks felt. Not a 
single officer was black, until finally a black chaplain was brought in near 
the end of my tour. About the only decent job ever given to a black soldier 
while I was there was running the motor pool. Most officers did not hide their 
blatant racism when alone with other whites. 
</P>
<P>
The tension erupted many times into violence, particularly one time after a 
black leader was sent to prison on charges of selling drugs. I came to dread 
the darkness -- when these incidents occurred. 
</P>
<P>
We built an orphanage, which was a good deed. And some of us made friends with 
some of the Vietnamese. But everything else was a sick blur of feuding, 
laughing at the officers' one-upmanship and wondering just what we were really 
doing there. 
</P>
<P>
Our drug program was truly straight out of the Marx Brothers, with even the 
drug counselors toking up with the bad guys who turned themselves in to avoid 
jail time. Many soldiers, who blamed the poor Vietnamese workers in the 
compound for their predicament, spent much of their time trying to dog any 
duties assigned to them. One warrant officer, whose only crime I ever saw was 
that he loved the Army, paid for his loyalty with a frag exploding against a 
wall of his room. No one was ever caught. Even worse, few really cared. 
</P>
<P>
So little seemed significant. Too many were too angry to form lasting 
friendships. Our only common bond was the rocket attacks, which brought us a 
day or two of community peace with each other. 
</P>
<P>
When I flew out, heading home after my tour ended, the plane was full of 
cheers. I was overcome with sadness. What the hell had it all been about? 
</P>
<P>
I have tremendous empathy for fellows like Ron Kovic, the true-life central 
figure in "Born on the Fourth of July." Kovic and many thousands of others 
faced so much more than those of us at the Air Force base in Da Nang. But on a 
smaller scale, we searched for some of the same answers as he. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe, just maybe, one of these days I can bring myself to watch his movie.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the gentle rise of clay bluffs where sand and sea meet, Gabrieleno Indians 
once foraged for food and provisions. Sir Francis Drake sailed by in 1579, and 
in 1904, it was here that Henry Huntington's fabled red electric trains whisked 
in amid great fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
And now this core area of Huntington Beach, the beach-bluff land adjacent to 
the pier, waits its next turn with history. Environmentalists and city 
officials are in a virtual civil war over whether to build on the land -- the 
proposed project is called Pierside Village -- or to leave it in its 
semi-developed, paved parking lot condition. 
</P>
<P>
A court case involving the land was settled without trial last week, but the 
legal settlement failed to resolve the central dispute: whether the land should 
be left essentially undeveloped or whether it should be built into a plaza of 
fountains, walkways and restaurants in the Pierside Village project. 
</P>
<P>
Pierside Village provokes strong passions in this community. It has divided the 
City Council and galvanized environmental groups that loathe the idea of 
building on land next to the public beach. It has also served as a rallying 
point for pro-development civic groups that have long decried the tattered look 
of downtown and the main beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The new project will be a great asset to our city," said Tom Van Tuyl, 
president of the Huntington Beach-Fountain Valley Board of Realtors. Pierside 
Village, he said, would "transform a parking lot which has no public facilities 
at this time into more than 2.5 acres of public plazas and promenades, which 
will be open to public use." 
</P>
<P>
But Geri Ortega, chairwoman of the city Planning Commission, strenuously 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The project has been deficient from the first time out of the gate," she said. 
Ortega and other critics contend that building commercial restaurants on the 
ocean side of Pacific Coast Highway would defile the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Project critics had hoped that a lawsuit would cripple or destroy Pierside 
Village. The lawsuit was filed in 1986 as the city tried, through eminent 
domain action, to gain title to the three acres of land proposed for the 
project. During the four-year wait for a court hearing, the state attorney 
general's office and the State Lands Commission sought to block the project, 
claiming that new restaurants would violate a public easement on the land and 
would also block public access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was settled, without trial, last week in Orange County Superior Court 
with both the city and state claiming victory. The city said it had won clear 
legal title to the three acres of land because of the suit. The state claimed 
it had succeeded in keeping intact the public easement on the land and 
disagreed that the city had won clear title to the land. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the legal points, Pierside Village did not get the death blow most of 
its critics had wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The acreage proposed for Pierside Village is not pristine beach. The narrow 
strip of land currently is occupied by Maxwell's Restaurant and a string of 
paved parking lots that extend from Main Street to 1st (formerly Lake) Street. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for remodeling and moving Maxwell's Restaurant and building two new 
restaurants. The three buildings would be on a landscaped plaza, with three 
levels of parking underneath the plaza. The existing paved parking lots on the 
land currently provide 220 parking slots. Pierside Village's underground garage 
would have 510 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Erskine, a strong supporter of the concept, believes the 
existing situation on the beach-bluff land is not only ugly but unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's a blighted parking lot and a hangout for dope smokers and 
ne'er-do-wells," Erskine said. "It's certainly not scenic in its present 
condition, and people don't go there to view the ocean. But they would be able 
to go there and get a good view of the ocean if Pierside Village is built. It 
would be a place for older adults to enjoy. They could sit on the benches and 
enjoy the view." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Chodos, spokesman for Pierside Development, which hopes to build the 
restaurant project, thinks some critics have used the "public access" issue as 
a sham argument against the project. "I've always thought talk about public 
access was a red herring," Chodos said. "People would have easier access to 
view the ocean if this project is built." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert G. Collins says the state does not believe 
commercial restaurants should be on land dedicated as a public easement. 
</P>
<P>
"That easement still stands, and I don't think big restaurants are compatible 
with the easement, " Collins said. He added that he doubts the California 
Coastal Commission will approve construction permits for Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, spokeswoman for Save Our Parks, added that her group would "go 
back to court if necessary on this. Pierside Village is not what is meant by 
'public recreational use' of this land and that's what the easement protects." 
</P>
<P>
Erskine countered that Cook and other outspoken critics "are just using this 
out of political motivation. . . . Most of the other people I talk to in this 
city don't have anything bad to say about Pierside Village." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Grace Winchell, one of the two council members opposed to the 
project, recently said that very serious environmental concerns are at stake. 
Winchell, speaking at a council meeting, said many people were opposed to 
Pierside Village because it would put more commercial development on the ocean 
side of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"This beach is our crown. . . . Let's not destroy the crown," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the city's 45,000 homes soon will be receiving cards with 
instructions for emergency evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
The laminated cards were developed primarily to provide city residents with the 
address of the nearest evacuation site in the event of an earthquake, according 
to a report by emergency management coordinator Frances Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only residents moving into new homes receive local emergency 
information, in a booklet that is distributed by developers. 
</P>
<P>
The card will be mailed to all residences and will be required to be 
distributed upon close of escrow for all homes, Winslow said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, approved by the City Council, is expected to cost the city 
$30,000. WENDY PAULSON

RELIGIOUS GROUP SEEKS RIGHT TO SITE

<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in as many months, the City Council has been asked by a 
religious organization for permission to congregate at a site zoned for 
industrial use. 
</P>
<P>
Lorani Ministry, a nonprofit organization affiliated with Grace Korean Church 
of Norwalk, wants to run a youth ministry center for about 120 high school 
students from a site on Portal Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial businesses and Los Alamitos Elementary School border the property. 
</P>
<P>
The council held a public hearing on the matter but postponed a final decision 
until May 14 so that the city can contact the organization's potential 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission had approved the group's request for a conditional use 
permit on April 2, but Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi appealed that decision to 
the council, saying a five-year lease is too long and that the surrounding 
tenants should be notified. 
</P>
<P>
Distinctions were made at the council meeting between Lorani Ministry's request 
for a permit and the one made by Grace Church (a different organization) that 
the council denied earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
While Grace Church wanted to establish its headquarters -- complete with 
sanctuary and fellowship hall -- on Winners Circle, representatives from Lorani 
Ministry said they would only use the Portal Drive property as a gathering 
place for the youth ministry program and that church services would not be held 
there. KATHIE BOZANICH

ALDRICH MEMORIAL TO BE HELD IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tribute to UC Irvine's founding chancellor, Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., will be 
held May 11 in the spot he chose to be the heart of the campus in the early 
1960s, officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial to Aldrich, who died April 9 at the age of 71 after a protracted 
battle with intestinal cancer, will be held at 4 p.m. in the Rock Garden in 
Aldrich Park. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be no other site for this tribute than the park for which Dan had 
such a special fondness," said UCI Chancellor Jack Peltason, who served as 
Aldrich's first vice chancellor for academic affairs at the university. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will include the unveiling of a memorial plaque donated by the UCI 
Alumni Assn. and the planting of a tree donated by UC Riverside, where Aldrich 
began his association with the University of California in 1943 as a soil 
chemist. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers sharing their memories of the popular chancellor will include Peltason 
and Raymond Watson, vice chairman of the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
The family has asked that anyone wishing to make donations in Aldrich's name do 
so to one of three memorial funds: the UCI Alumni Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Graduate Fellowship Fund; the Endowment for the Beautification of the Campus, 
or to a fellow at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley. All can be sent 
in care of the UCI Foundation, 600 Administration, UC Irvine, Calif., 92717. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial celebration is open to the public. Campus parking will be free 
from 3 to 6 p.m. that afternoon. KRISTINA LINDGREN

OLD FARM IS MUSHROOMING INTO MODEL RECYCLING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rubble of demolished storage sheds, jackhammered concrete slabs, and 
whatever else remains of an old mushroom farm is finding an unusual use. 
</P>
<P>
At the site of the 1920s-era farm on Golden West Avenue, massive machinery has 
been moved in to convert demolished buildings into mounds of shredded wood and 
pulverized concrete to be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive recycling project will net a profit for the wrecking firm, help 
the city save money and even help rebuild the city pier. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they also are weighing a proposal to establish a 
semi-permanent facility to recycle discarded material from various construction 
projects, which could generate hundreds of thousands of dollars for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Through those combined efforts, "we could have the biggest recycling program in 
the state," Mayor Thomas J. Mays said last week. "We want to be a model for 
other city programs throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
Leveling the mushroom farm near Ellis Avenue is costing the city about $270,000 
less than the $593,000 it originally budgeted, because of sales of recyclable 
materials and avoided transportation and landfill costs, city engineer Robert 
Eichblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is producing about 15,000 tons of crushed base concrete, much of 
which will be used in construction at the site, where the city will relocate 
residents from an adjacent mobile-home park. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the concrete product will be sold as material to be used in street 
construction and repaving, said Dennis Patton, project specialist for Pomona 
Valley Environmental Inc., the Chino-based firm the city hired to demolish the 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 400 yards of wood chips will be sold as fuel for steam 
cogenerating plants, and the more finely ground wooden debris can be used for 
city landscaping and mulching, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Pomona Valley Environmental also plans to donate $1 for each ton 
of recycled material -- totaling between $15,000 and $50,000 -- to the city's 
pier reconstruction fund, Patton and city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The company also is lobbying to set up a recycling center in the city. City 
officials are currently studying a Pomona Valley Environmental proposal to move 
the recycling equipment now at the mushroom farm site to a 5.8-acre county 
transfer station to recycle waste materials from development projects 
throughout west Orange County. The facility would be coordinated with a 
household rubbish recycling center being established there by Rainbow Disposal 
Inc., the city's curbside trash collector. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona Valley Environmental facility would cost the city $1.8 million to 
set up, Patton said. But the city probably would recover those costs within the 
first few years of operation by collecting some percentage of the plant 
revenues, he said. JOHN PENNER

FRENCH NAME ROSE AFTER SISTER CITY NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gardeners in Antibes, France, have created a rose named "Newport Beach" after 
Antibes' sister city in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Antibes officials visited Newport Beach last week to finalize the business and 
cultural exchanges that will be part of the sister city relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Antibes officials announced the new flower last week as Newport Beach leaders 
dedicated the rose garden in front of City Hall to the French Riviera town. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through a translator to the 50 or so members of the Antibes delegation 
visiting Newport, Mayor Ruthelyn Plummer said the purpose of the sister city 
program is to promote "international understanding and to broaden the horizons 
of our young students" through home stay exchanges and pen pal programs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Plummer and a group of Newport Beach residents visited Antibes, a 
Mediterranean port village famous for its production of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Antibes, Newport maintains cultural and business exchange 
connections with Okazaki, Japan, and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS 58TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
PRIMARY RACE AMONG GOP CANDIDATES LIKELY TO REMAIN CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a little more than a month left in the campaign, some of the five 
Republican candidates seeking to replace departing Assemblyman Dennis Brown are 
struggling for money, others remain virtually unknown, but all are running hard 
in a race that is likely to remain close through the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the 12-year Republican assemblyman from Los Alamitos, set off the 
last-minute scramble for his seat just last month when he made the surprise 
announcement that he would not seek reelection in his coastal district, which 
stretches from Huntington Beach into Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just going to come down to the very end," said candidate Jeffrey 
A. Kellogg, a Long Beach councilman. "You're just going to see a mad rush at 
the very end." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans face the only primary for the 58th Assembly District on June 5 
since only one Democratic candidate, Luanne W. Pryor of Long Beach, and one 
Libertarian Party member, Scott Stier of Long Beach, are entered in the race. 
</P>
<P>
The other Republicans are Seymour Alban, a 65-year-old physician from Long 
Beach; Jan Hall, another Long Beach City Council member; Huntington Beach Mayor 
Thomas J. Mays; and Peter E. von Elten, a vice president at MOLA Development 
Corp. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans hold a registration edge in the district of about 51% to 39%. Just 
more than half of the voters are in the Long Beach portion of the district, but 
the majority of Republicans are in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates who have never run for political office -- Alban and von 
Elten -- have the most money. Alban said he expects to spend up to $400,000 in 
the primary, and von Elten's campaign was hoping for more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The three city politicians running for the office complained that they will be 
vastly outspent, with some estimating their campaigns at $100,000 or less. They 
noted, however, that von Elten and Alban would require more money to win 
because neither has a political base. 
</P>
<P>
As for issues, the environment has been a hot button in most races this year, 
but it has been emphasized even more in the 58th district race because of the 
394,000-gallon oil spill that blackened the Orange County coast following a 
tanker accident in February. 
</P>
<P>
That incident practically created Mays' candidacy. Local and national 
television in the critical hours after the spill gave the local mayor a 
ubiquitous presence as he spoke on behalf of angry residents. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, 36, along with all of the Republican candidates except Kellogg, has come 
out against additional offshore oil drilling and in favor of more regulation to 
protect the coast from spills. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg, who has worked with his family's oil company operating on-shore 
drilling sites, said he does not believe the waters off the 58th district 
shores should accommodate more drilling, but he would not rule out his support 
for a specific project. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take it on a case-by-case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, despite all of the Republican candidates appealing for 
environmental votes, the district has been represented for 12 years by an 
assemblyman who was rated one of the worst in the state by the League of 
Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Linney, political director for the league in San Francisco, said the 
campaign to replace Brown is a high priority for the group because it has a 
chance to replace one of its strongest opponents with a conservationist. 
</P>
<P>
Linney said the group plans to question each of the candidates. So far, it has 
talked only to Alban. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel fairly comfortable with him as a candidate," Linney said. 
</P>
<P>
Alban is the only Republican candidate who expressed support for the so-called 
Big Green initiative, a sweeping environmental measure that qualified Thursday 
for the November ballot. Alban said, however, that he was reluctant to endorse 
the measure because he believed it was being used by Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate John Van de Kamp as a campaign tool. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other Republicans said they supported portions of the sweeping 
measure, but not in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
Developer von Elten, 46, said he demonstrated concern for the environment when 
his company paid to clean up a toxic waste dump in Huntington Beach before 
building houses on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a model cleanup, and not a penny cost to the taxpayers," said von 
Elten, also a Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, all of the Republicans except Mays are opposed to laws that 
prohibit a woman from seeking an abortion. Of the four who support abortion 
rights, only Kellogg is opposed to government funding for poor women seeking 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
At a candidates' forum Thursday night in Long Beach, which Kellogg did not 
attend, Mays was the only candidate opposed to some forms of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
The other three candidates supported a 15-day waiting period for obtaining a 
gun and a ban on assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"Gun control is not going to solve the crime problem," Mays said. "Criminals 
won't have to wait for a gun." 
</P>
<P>
On Proposition 111, the proposed 9-cent gas tax to pay for transportation 
improvements, all of the Republican candidates supported the measure except 
Kellogg, who said he was unsatisfied with how the state spends the existing gas 
tax.

Bob Frasco was a big man on the El Modena High School campus in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Frasco took over as the Vanguards' starting quarterback after the fourth game. 
The team then won 10 straight and the CIF Southern Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Frasco was just another face in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old was among approximately 260 pro-football hopefuls, some coming 
from as far away as Florida and Georgia, performing for scouts from the NFL, 
Canadian Football League and Arena Football. They turned fields at UC Irvine 
into fields of dreams. The players ranged in age from the early 20s to 
35-year-old Frederick Warde Brand III. 
</P>
<P>
Brand's resume mentioned his graduation from George Washington University 
Medical School in 1989 and his desire to play tight end, but added that he also 
could play quarterback, guard, linebacker and strong safety, and was "an animal 
on special teams." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the seventh annual Nationwide Professional Football Search, light 
years away from the pro football played at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference here was that, instead of being paid to play, in nearly 
all cases, the aspirants had to pay to play, or have an agent pick up the $75 
fee assessed by the Laguna Niguel-based Nationwide Professional Football Search 
to cover field, staff, equipment and insurance costs. Another tryout will be 
held next weekend at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the $75 was just the start of the total costs. 
</P>
<P>
University of Minnesota teammates Brent Herbel, J.J. Lennon and Shane Strain 
flew to the Southland on Saturday from Minneapolis and expect the weekend here 
to cost them $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The trio attended the camp after being told about it by their agent, Alan Reid. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the few opportunities I'll have to show myself to pro scouts," 
said Herbel, the Gophers' punter the past four seasons and a second-team 
All-Big 10 selection in 1988. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime shot." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday could have been the final punt in Herbel's life. He said if he is not 
invited to an NFL training camp this summer, he will enter medical school at 
the University of North Dakota in September. 
</P>
<P>
While Herbel's pro-football dream could end this weekend, it is a continuing 
quest for Frasco. 
</P>
<P>
Frasco attended the tryout at the request of the Canadian Football League's 
British Columbia Lions and was exempted from paying the $75 fee. This is 
Frasco's fifth attempt to land a job in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
If all had gone as planned in Frasco's last attempt to make a pro-football 
roster, he would be in Europe now, quarterbacking a team in the International 
League of American Football, an eight-team circuit scheduled to begin play 
April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Although Frasco made the team, the ILAF suspended operations for this season 
after it was unable to get playing dates in stadiums in Italy because of 
soccer's World Cup and lack of work permits for players. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big disappointment," Frasco said. "I organized everything around 
that. I sold my car and didn't get a job because I thought I'd be in Europe for 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Frasco's life affected by his dream, it also dominates the life of 
his fiancee, Diane Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole lives are run by it -- where we live and how we live. Growing up 
with football, I can understand how players can't let go," said Davis, whose 
father, Bill Davis, was an NFL executive. 
</P>
<P>
The ILAF suspension was the latest setback for Frasco, who was cut by the 
Raiders during training camp in 1985. During the 1987 players' strike, he 
signed but didn't play for the Rams replacement team. Undaunted, Frasco is 
still trying. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole life, I've been trying to make it in pro ball," Frasco said. "It 
would be a different story if I didn't think I could play. I still think I can 
play, and I am not going to give up until I wake up in the morning and that 
feeling's not there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Frasco also will attend next weekend's audition, at Cal State Fullerton, in the 
hopes of being signed by the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could go up there and play for two or three years, I'd be satisfied," 
said Frasco, who played for Italy's Legnano Frogs the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I could end my career on a happy note," he said. "I understand that one in a 
million makes it in the NFL, but it doesn't have to be the NFL for me." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Leedom, president of Nationwide Professional Football Search, said 
Saturday's turnout was the largest of the five camps his firm has held at UCI. 
He estimates between 15 and 20 players will be signed by pro teams.

MIKE PENNER: HE'S BIG, BUT HIS GAME NOW LARGER THAN LIFE

<P>
Tank Kronemann rolled through Ojai again this year, just as he had during the 
previous three, but there are always newcomers in the audience and on first 
sighting, Tank's a lot for the optic nerve to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this moose," one elderly gentlemen exclaimed as he and a friend sat in 
the bleachers, watching Trevor Kronemann peel off his massive UC Irvine sweat 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
"He must weigh 280," the friend replied, almost reverently. 
</P>
<P>
For several minutes there is silence. Kronemann completes his warmups and the 
tennis match commences. Tank smashes a few forehands. Tank crushes a few 
serves. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," the first man says, piping up again, "he'd probably make a lot more 
money playing football." 
</P>
<P>
The friend shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so sure," he says. "Looks to me like he's got a pretty good game." 
</P>
<P>
That, in a nutshell, is the Tank Kronemann viewing experience. The first 
impression arrives with a snicker, but stick around long enough and you'll take 
your place among the converted. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear everything that goes on in the stands. I'm very aware," Kronemann says. 
"I catch flak for my size, for the way I play. I hear, daily, 'You can't be a 
tennis player. You're too big. You're going to wear down.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I have a chance to be a four-time All-American and only one other guy has 
ever done that." 
</P>
<P>
The other guy is Rick Leach, which isn't bad company for someone who looks like 
a blond John Belushi and possesses the same sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
As Kronemann stands at the baseline, as he did during Sunday's third-set 
tiebreaker against San Jose State's Mike Chinchiolo, he cuts an unforgettable 
figure. Drenched in sweat, his white pullover shirt turns see-through, clinging 
for dear life to a substantial belly that flops over his belt. A dirt-stained 
knee brace stretches across a huge left thigh. Scraggly yellow locks billow 
from beneath a neon green Big Dog surfer cap, its exaggerated, extra-long bill 
flipped upward in goofball fashion. Yes, America, this is one of your finest 
collegiate tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
When Kronemann defeated Chinchiolo, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, it gave him four singles 
championships in four trips to the Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament. It also gave 
him a 30-12 record for the 1990 season, which should boost his current No. 18 
standing in the NCAA tennis rankings. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Kronemann is 6-feet-3 and, in season, weighs between 228 and 
232 pounds. Off-season, after a summer of mom's lasagna, Kronemann checks in at 
240, although UC Irvine Coach Greg Patton claims it's closer to 255. 
</P>
<P>
In a sport where 195-pound Boris Becker is considered husky, Kronemann carries 
a Refrigerator kind of persona. Spectators seem astonished, not only when he 
runs down a volley, but just by his presence on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, he moves well for his size. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big-boned guy in a graceful, lithe sport," Patton says. "It'd be great 
if he made it in the pros, because he'd bring a lot of new fans into the sport. 
A lot of big people see him play and say, 'Hey, he looks just like me.' He's 
living proof that great things can come in big packages." 
</P>
<P>
Patton was the one who came up with the nickname Tank. 
</P>
<P>
So, on this year's Irvine tennis media guide, Patton and Kronemann are pictured 
together, a toy tank balanced on Kronemann's racket, underneath the 
inscription: UCI's General and The Tank. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years earlier, when mega-forward Wayne Engelstad played for Bill 
Mulligan's basketball team, Patton had another brainstorm. He wanted to dress 
big Wayne in tennis togs, pose him next to Tank -- forming an industrial 
strength doubles team -- and call them The Beasts of the Baseline. 
</P>
<P>
"It would've made a great poster," Patton says. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann's strength as a tennis player isn't difficult to discern. The Tank 
cranks. "I probably hit as hard as (Andre) Agassi," Kronemann says, not 
boastfully. "I grew up with Jim Courier and Pete Sampras. Those guys don't hit 
any harder than I do." 
</P>
<P>
And, rest assured, none of them elicit the same kind of reaction Kronemann does 
when they unload on a forehand or a serve. 
</P>
<P>
When's the last time you saw a player hit a tennis ball so hard, people 
laughed? 
</P>
<P>
With Kronemann, it happens. With a seeming flick of the wrist, Kronemann can 
pulverize a ball -- "BBs out of a cannon" is how Patton describes it -- and the 
ball screams off the racket like a sonic boom. In its own way, it can be as 
awesome as a Jose Canseco home run. The viewer is left so stunned, so 
delightfully startled, that the only response he can muster is a nervous 
giggle. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann believes this to be his great equalizer. If his game appears better 
suited for doubles -- hell, he is a doubles team -- Kronemann maintains that 
Big Thunder, along with a lot of heart, will make him a top 100 singles player 
on the pro circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Christmas at Sarasota, I beat Jimmy Brown, who's No. 80 in the world," 
Kronemann says. "Two weeks before that, he beat (Mats) Wilander, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the type of game that's real explosive. If I get in a groove for two, 
three weeks at a time, I can be a top 100 player. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what it takes. If I have to live out of a van and eat sandwiches 
and scrape and crawl my way to the top, I'm going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
As Kronemann says, "There are exceptions to the rule. I'm hoping to become the 
Spud Webb of tennis." 
</P>
<P>
It's an odd analogy, but only until you begin to think about it. Webb is a 
little man making a living in a big man's game. Kronemann is a big man trying 
to survive in a little man's game. Already, Kronemann has changed the lexicon 
of the sport. At Irvine, for instance, it is now considered a compliment to 
tell a player he just tanked a match.

PRUDENCE CERTAINLY PAYING OFF FOR HOUSEBUSTER

"You have perhaps the fastest racehorse in America," ABC commentator Jim McKay 
said to owner Bob Levy before his colt, Housebuster, ran in the Derby Trial 
Saturday. "Why will you not consider the Kentucky Derby for him?" 
</P>
<P>
Levy explained to a national television audience that he and trainer Jimmy 
Croll thought that Housebuster was basically a sprinter, but McKay wouldn't 
take no for an answer. "Well, what about the Preakness?" he demanded. And after 
Housebuster won the Derby Trial with an effortless 5 1/4-length victory, McKay 
was immediately back on the air to ask, "Well, Bob, what do you say now?" 
</P>
<P>
McKay's incredulity was understandable, because prudence and caution are 
qualities rarely seen at Churchill Downs in the springtime. The owners and 
trainers of decent 3-year-olds will rationalize, will deceive themselves, will 
ask horses to do the impossible to get to the Kentucky Derby. Many will go into 
next Saturday's Derby with horses who aren't remotely in Housebuster's class. 
Many would love to run a horse who would be in front as the field turned into 
the stretch. From that point, anything could happen. What trainer could resist 
such a chance to win America's most famous horse race? 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Croll could, because he's still haunted by memories of the last time he 
pursued the Derby with a horse who shouldn't have been here. The year was 1973, 
and the horse was Mr. Prospector, who might have been one of the most brilliant 
thoroughbreds of all time. We'll never know. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of his 3-year-old season, in only the third start of his career, 
Mr. Prospector ran six furlongs in an unbelievable 1:07 4/5. "Right away the 
owners were talking about the Derby," Croll said. "I tried to tell them he 
didn't have enough seasoning. I kept saying, 'We can't run in the Derby! We 
can't do it! We can't do it!' I wasn't successful in dissuading them." 
</P>
<P>
So Mr. Prospector came to Kentucky, where Croll tried to transform the 
speedster into the classic distance runner he wasn't cut out to be. The colt 
lost an allowance race in his first attempt to go a distance. Then he ran in 
the Derby Trial, where he was bumped around as if it were the roller derby, and 
he broke a cannon bone. He never ran for the roses; he never ran again at all. 
</P>
<P>
But after he went to stud and became one of the most influential sires in the 
world, Mr. Prospector proved what a special animal he was -- something that 
Croll had known all along. "He could have been one of the great ones; I truly 
believe that," the trainer said. "I never got over it." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Housebuster has given Croll a chance to relive the past, and to 
correct it. Like Mr. Prospector, the colt has displayed brilliant speed ever 
since he first set foot on the track. He won a seven-furlong stakes at 
Gulfstream Park this winter, defeating Summer Squall, the favorite for the 
Kentucky Derby, and Thirty Six Red, the winner of the $500,000 Wood Memorial at 
Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Housebuster doesn't have the pedigree to win the Kentucky Derby. This may 
sound unfair and elitist, especially in a country that reveres the concept of 
equal opportunity for all, but the truth is inescapable. While horses with 
humble pedigrees may win the Derby, horses with pure sprint pedigrees don't. 
Croll knows this. The trainer believes that Housebuster can be effective up to 
distances of a mile or thereabouts, but said that "our ultimate goal is to be 
the champion sprinter." 
</P>
<P>
With this goal in mind, Croll has assiduously avoided temptations that might 
divert him. When Housebuster was in Florida this winter, the 3-year-olds in the 
big-money stakes races were a rather weak group, and Housebuster probably could 
have beaten them even though he isn't a distance runner. But Croll passed the 1 
1/16-mile Fountain of Youth Stakes, explaining, "I think he could have won, but 
if he had we'd have had to go to the Florida Derby, and then if he'd run half 
decently he'd have to go somewhere else (the Kentucky Derby, for instance). I 
think it would have been the wrong thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
So Croll plans to spend most of the year finding appropriate spots at one mile 
or shorter for Housebuster. The Derby Trial, with a weak field and a $75,000 
purse, looked like an ideal place to test the colt at a mile for the first 
time. It was. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster battled head and head down the backstretch with another speedster, 
Falling Sky, but while his rival was under a drive, Housebuster was cruising. 
He sped the first half-mile on this dull racing strip in 45 3-5 seconds and 
jockey Craig Perret had him under wraps as he cruised to victory over Private 
School. Falling Sky was third. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a powerhouse," marveled Keith Allen, who rode the runner-up. 
Housebuster covered the mile in 1:37 3/5, a good time on this track, 
considering that cheap horses in the last race of the day required 1:43 3/5 to 
go that distance. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference between running this distance and one-quarter mile farther 
constitutes a whole new game, and requires a whole different type of horse. 
Casual fans may not understand this, and optimistic horsemen at the Derby might 
not either, but Levy and Croll do. When they put Housebuster on a van and ship 
him out of Churchill Downs, they won't have any doubts about the wisdom of 
their decision.

FOR A CHANGE, JAPANESE FIRMS BUOY RUST BELT;

<P>
MIDWEST: JAPAN'S INVESTMENT IN AUTOS AND STEEL ADDS A COAT OF RUST-PROOFING TO 
THE INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND.

<P>
The Midwest is doing a better job of avoiding a recession this year than anyone 
anticipated, and the region appears to have some unlikely benefactors to thank 
for its new-found economic stability -- the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese corporations are making huge investments throughout the Midwest in 
manufacturing industries like steel and automobiles, rapidly upgrading and 
transforming the economic base of a region often known, until recently, as the 
"Rust Belt." As a result, Japanese companies are becoming key generators of new 
jobs in the heartland, offsetting losses at traditional American employers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just a decade after the first wave of Japanese companies set up shop in 
the region, the Japanese employ a total of 103,000 workers in Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. According to a new study by 
the Japanese consulate in Chicago, this employment figure marks a 66% increase 
from 1988, when Japanese firms employed 62,000 in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Such massive job creation seems to be helping the region avoid a serious 
economic slump, despite the current woes of many of U.S. manufacturers based in 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Japan's Midwestern operations are so big they dominate the small towns 
and mid-size cities where they have been located.

Nippon Steel, for example, is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into a $1 
billion joint venture with Chicago-based Inland Steel to produce high-quality 
steel at a new mill in rural New Carlisle, Ind., that will use the latest in 
Japanese technology and eventually create 500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away in Lafayette, Ind., meanwhile, Subaru and Isuzu have spent $500 
million on a new joint-venture assembly plant, employing more than 2,200 
workers, to produce both cars and utility vehicles for the American market. In 
addition, Isuzu officials say at least 27 Japanese parts suppliers have opened 
smaller factories in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio to supply the assembly plant. 
</P>
<P>
Today, scores of Japanese companies have located in towns like New Carlisle and 
Lafayette throughout the upper Midwest, often bringing a cosmopolitan touch to 
communities that had not changed much for decades. The Japanese consulate's 
survey found that Japanese companies now operate a total of 1,048 factories and 
other offices in the region, a 20% gain over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how many Japanese companies have gone into these small towns," 
says Diane Swonk, an economist at First National Bank of Chicago. In fact, the 
local Japanese factory is becoming a small-town fixture, along with the grain 
elevator and the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"New Carlisle is a town of only 1,400 people that hadn't changed much in many, 
many years," observes Town Council President Dave Swope. "So people were a 
little apprehensive when the Japanese first came. But I think people are 
starting to come around to realize the tremendous economic benefits that (the 
Nippon-Inland steel mill) is bringing." 
</P>
<P>
More and more communities are finding the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt about the fact that investments like the Subaru-Isuzu plant 
are good for places like Lafayette," says Jack Riley, a senior vice president 
with American Isuzu. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers believe that the massive Japanese investment in the region has 
helped offset the slump in the Detroit-based domestic auto industry. In past 
economic cycles, a sharp drop in domestic auto sales usually prompted a 
contraction throughout the Midwest. State officials in Ohio used to say that 
"when General Motors catches a cold, Ohio gets pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
No longer. Today, the biggest private employer in the Columbus area is Honda, 
with more than 9,000 workers; meanwhile, GM has closed one assembly plant in 
Cincinnati and is threatening to shutter another operation near Youngstown as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
But even with production cutbacks by the Big Three auto makers throughout the 
region, Midwestern unemployment has remained remarkably low. "If the auto 
industry had gone into this kind of slump five or six years ago, this area 
would be in an outright recession," observes David Sowerby, an economist at 
Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in Illinois, for example, the jobless rate averaged just 5.9% in 1989; 
during the last recession in the early 1980s, it peaked at nearly 11.5%. 
Indiana's unemployment rate dipped below 5% this winter, after stagnating in 
the double digits from 1981 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese investment has really helped us flatten out the business cycle here," 
says Rob Fowler, vice president for business development for the Indiana 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the big-ticket investments by Japanese firms in the Midwest have come 
in the auto industry, which has clustered its American facilities in the 
region. Indeed, they have largely offset the job losses at the Big Three; while 
the domestic auto makers closed nine assembly plants during the 1980s, the 
Japanese have opened eight, and seven of them are in the central United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese certainly have softened the blow from autos," says economist 
Swonk. "Ohio has been below the national average in unemployment lately, and 
Honda is a big factor in that," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
But Japanese steelmakers have become big players in the region as well. In 
addition to the Nippon-Inland joint venture, the best example may be the case 
of National Steel, which has been rapidly modernizing its sprawling Great Lakes 
Steel operation in Ecorse, Mich., outside Detroit, in order to supply higher 
quality steel to the auto industry. National is a joint venture between Nippon 
Kokan Steel of Japan and Pittsburgh's National Intergroup. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually all of the Japanese investment in the American steel industry is in 
the Midwest," observes Bernard Lashinsky, an economist at Inland Steel. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Midwest is apparently benefitting from Japanese investment more 
than almost any other region of the nation. A February survey of Japanese 
companies by the Japan External Trade Organization found that Illinois, Ohio 
and Michigan all ranked in the top five states in the country in terms of the 
number of Japanese factories or other facilities they have attracted. 
</P>
<P>
While California, which traditionally has been a favorite location for Japanese 
firms, still ranks first with 202 plants, the survey found that Ohio and 
Illinois have had the greatest growth in new Japanese factories since 1985.

EXPO PROVIDES FORUM FOR BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Displaying everything from Cajun-style candy to hand-made African fashions, 
many of Los Angeles' black business owners shared their dreams and wares over 
the weekend at a lively two-day Black Business Expo. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 exhibitors and hundreds of visitors filled an exhibition hall at 
the Los Angeles Convention Center, while a variety of inspirational speakers 
spoke to standing-room-only crowds upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have an earthly idea what to expect, but it's been very helpful," 
said Jolene Green, a distributor for Lynell's, a Houston-based cosmetics 
company. Green said she put the marketing tips she learned in a pre-expo 
workshop to work in her colorful booth. 
</P>
<P>
"We want these people to be successful, not just at this show, but at other 
shows," said Barbara Lindsey, whose marketing firm, Lindsey &amp; Associates, 
organized the event. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the positive response to last year's expo, which featured about 50 
businesses, Lindsey said she decided to do it again. This year, participation 
more than tripled. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of relying on traditional corporate sponsors, Lindsey said she looked 
within the black community for financial support. Recycling Black Dollars, a 
nonprofit organization that encourages black consumers to buy from black 
business owners, was a key sponsor. Business owners who join the group extend a 
10% discount on goods and services to all members. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey also solicited financial support from United Health Plan, Family 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and the Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage attendance by students and young people, Lindsey said she gave 
away 10,000 free tickets. General admission tickets were $5, with a $3 fee for 
students and seniors. Once inside, visitors wandered through the exhibition 
hall collecting company literature and free samples. 
</P>
<P>
A lively mix of booths set up by bakeries, radio stations, clothing companies, 
insurance and real estate brokers, computer consultants and security services 
filled the hall. Business owners were busy promoting a Christian video dating 
service, water and air purification systems, clowns for rent and silk-screened 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout both days, participants were entertained and educated by a non-stop 
schedule of lectures on subjects ranging from reducing stress to raising money. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Pemberton, who recently opened Ed's Housecleaning Services in Los 
Angeles, invested $500 to rent a booth so she could meet other black business 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing housecleaning since I was 12 and now I'm building up clientele 
for this business," said Pemberton, who named her company after her father, Ed, 
who died in February. 
</P>
<P>
The expo provided her with a way to not only create a mailing list of potential 
customers, but also to connect with other black business owners who provide 
household products and services. 
</P>
<P>
One eye-catching booth attracted visitors with its array of clothes made from 
brilliant hand-woven fabrics from Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband, Issa, is African, and when we went to visit his family on the 
Ivory Coast, I would bring clothing back," said Jo Keita, founder of the Nubian 
Princess. "When I wore the clothes, people would stop me and ask where I got 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the enthusiastic response to the unique African fabrics, she and her 
partner, Vicki Beya, decided to work with local African weavers, tailors and 
seamstresses to develop a line of upscale fashions that retail for between $100 
and $800. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Keita, who also manages a Hollywood recording studio, has been selling 
the clothes from her home and at trunk shows at the Hotel Le Dufy in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
If sales continue to be strong, Keita said she plans to open a retail store 
somewhere in West Hollywood or Beverly Hills by the end of the year. Meanwhile, 
throngs of candy lovers surrounded Uncle Darrow's Cajun Candy Co., clamoring 
for samples of the company's praline-style gourmet candy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a family recipe handed down from one generation to the next," said 
Norwood J. Clark, one of three cousins who founded the company. Clark said the 
expo provided him with "a terrific opportunity" to show off his tasty product.

Machine Tool Orders Jump: Machine tool orders surged 36.6% in March, to $265.85 
million from $194.55 million in February, the Assn. for Manufacturing 
Technology said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
However, compared to March, 1989, last month's machine tool orders, which are 
highly cyclical in nature, were down 8.5%. Year-to-date machine tool orders 
stood at $661.70 million, down 17.6% from the 1989 figure of $803.30 million. 
Industry analysts attributed the overall decrease in orders to a reduced demand 
from the automobile sector. March orders for domestic machine tools increased 
20.6% over February, while orders for foreign machine tools jumped 104%.

developments during the week of April 23: 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft Accused of Race, Sex Bias: A former program controls 
administrator with Hughes Aircraft Co. filed a race- and sex-discrimination 
case in U.S. District Court, claiming that her former supervisor repeatedly 
harassed her, called her a name and said he wanted to run over her with his 
car. Henrietta D. Amezcua repeatedly complained about the supervisor, who 
eventually was fired. 
</P>
<P>
But Amezcua was forced to quit the El Segundo office because "there was no 
possibility of advancement" after she was labeled a troublemaker and ostracized 
in her department, she said. A Hughes spokesman said the company has not seen 
the suit. (Filed April 26, 1990. Case No. 90-2097)

MILKEN'S LATEST WOE IS NAMED BENJAMIN STEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No voice has been louder than writer Benjamin J. Stein's in criticizing federal 
prosecutors for letting Michael Milken avoid a trial by acceding to six felony 
counts and $600 million in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
A prolific author and former speech writer in the Nixon White House, Stein says 
that the plea bargain was too soft and that a trial is needed to bring out the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
But is Stein telling all? 
</P>
<P>
Just days after the junk bond king agreed to plead guilty, Stein published an 
"open letter" in Barron's in which he said "junk was really a Ponzi scheme all 
along." Stein had an opinion piece in the New York Times, in which he called 
Milken "the premier financial swindler of all time." Stein was quoted in the 
Wall Street Journal and was interviewed on ABC World News Tonight with Peter 
Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
Stein was vocal, but certain ironies went unmentioned. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Stein was paid to act in a Western Union television commercial 
that ran from late 1987 through the end of last year. Western Union happens to 
be burdened with junk bonds issued through Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Western Union's problems are so big that it has acknowledged it may seek 
protection from creditors in bankruptcy court. Indeed, when Stein made the 
commercial, Drexel was an important stockholder in Western Union. An investment 
group including Milken and other Drexel executives was even trying to buy a 
controlling interest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Another irony: Stein wrote Milken in late 1988, offering to be an "in-house 
vetter of deals from a fairness to stockholders standpoint, and teacher of 
ethics to your young and bright colleagues." The letter was revealed in 
February's Spy magazine under the headline "The Queerest Letter Mike Milken 
Ever Received." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Stein said he was unaware of Western Union's relationship with 
Drexel. Besides, he said, he isn't opposed to all junk bonds, just those in 
which the risks are misrepresented. As for the letter to Milken, Stein, who 
also is a lawyer and economist, says he was not asking for a job, but offering 
to do the work "pro bono" for the billionaire Milken. Stein says he now regrets 
the way he worded the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Stein is probably best known as the defendant in a lawsuit filed by comedian 
Joan Rivers over a 1987 article he wrote under the pseudonym Bert Hacker in GQ. 
The article was a first-person account in which the author claimed to know 
Rivers, and to have heard her joke about her late husband, who killed himself. 
Stein later admitted he never met Rivers, and the suit was settled out of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Stein seemed unhappy when asked by The Times about the Western Union ad and the 
letter. He alleged that the questions were prompted by Linda Robinson, a 
partner in the New York public relations firm that represents Milken, and he 
vowed to say as much in Barron's. Ten minutes later, he called back to say he 
was just teasing.

Pathe Communications Suit: Pathe Communications Corp. sued businessman Giovanni 
DiStefano in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming he owes $1.7 million for an 
unpaid loan, rent and services, and contractual damages for failing to purchase 
Pathe shares as he allegedly promised. The suit follows DiStefano's libel suit 
filed April 20, in which he seeks $281 million plus punitive damages because 
Pathe took out newspaper ads saying he had never been a company director or 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
DiStefano says he was a senior vice president "virtually in charge of sales and 
acquisitions" from November, 1989, until early this year. (Filed April 23,

Fox Sued Over Manson Interview: Fox Broadcasting Co. was sued in Los Angeles 
Superior Court by Nikolas Schrenk, who claims Fox failed to get approval before 
using parts of his 1988 interview with convicted killer Charles Manson. 
</P>
<P>
The breach-of-contract suit alleges that Fox agreed Schrenk would approve its 
use of any footage from the Manson interview, broadcast in mid-1989 on "A 
Current Affair." Schrenk seeks unstated damages for revenue allegedly lost from 
expected sales of videotapes and other TV broadcasts of the interview. (Filed

BOND BUYERS ARE JUMPY, AND YIELDS MOVE LIKEWISE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENTS: CONCERNS ABOUT INFLATION HAVE MIXED WITH WORRIES ABOUT A JAPANESE 
WITHDRAWAL FROM THE TREASURY MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people who oversee the flow of billions through the markets earn their keep 
putting up with uncertainty. But sometimes the market's mysteries become too 
much even for them, and they head for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
That's roughly what's been happening in the bond market in recent weeks. 
Concerns about inflation have mixed with worries about a Japanese withdrawal 
from the Treasury-bond market, the unforeseen costs of the thrift bailout and 
other fears, driving some professional bond buyers from the action. 
</P>
<P>
Their pullback has caused bond yields to edge upward. Last week, the yield on 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds exceeded 9% for the first time in a year. 
That's was a substantial increase of about half a percentage point in just the 
past month. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of the bond buyers' nervousness was the full 1-percentage-point 
spread between yields on short-term and long-term Treasury bonds. The spread 
was investors' way of saying they needed to be paid more for the risk that 
inflation would erode some of their long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a certain amount of guts to face a market like this," said Kevin 
Logan, chief economist at the New York office of Swiss Bank Corp. "Right now, 
there aren't too many guys out there who want to be brave." 
</P>
<P>
The high rates have been greeted warmly by some individual investors, who have 
been buying bonds with a fervor not seen in some time. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation is giving the willies to institutional investors, who have 
worried that prices would slide further before they got around to selling. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond yields are benchmarks for a wide variety of other interest rates, 
so rising rates portend bad news for some sectors of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The auto and housing sectors, for example, are already weak. They could suffer 
even more if rates rise further. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest blow to the traders' confidence was a recent report on the consumer 
price index, which suggested that prices were rising quickly but didn't 
entirely explain why, Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
CPI numbers that came out April 17 showed that even when volatile food and 
energy components were stripped away, inflation was 0.7% in March. That came as 
a shock to the many investors who were looking for a rise of about 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter, inflation -- less food and energy components -- was 
rising at a 7.5% rate. "That just jumped out from behind a rock, and nobody 
quite knew why it was there," Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
For much of last week, bond traders were looking with apprehension toward 
Friday's release of government statistics that would show more about inflation 
and quantify the first-quarter rise of the gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market survived that report without a crisis, but perhaps only because 
it had hunkered down, expecting the worst. 
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the quarterly GNP was up 2.1%, twice the previous 
quarter's rate but substantially short of the 2.5% to 2.7% some analysts were 
expecting. The news was somewhat comforting, since a slower growth rate 
presumably means there will be less bidding up of prices. 
</P>
<P>
The inflation figures that came with Friday's government report were less 
reassuring. By an inflation gauge called the GNP deflator, prices were up 6.7% 
for the first quarter, compared to 4.5% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that the rise in long-term rates, by signaling the 
market's inflation anxieties, puts additional pressure on the Federal Reserve 
Board to hike rates. 
</P>
<P>
While the central bank isn't panicked as easily as the markets, some contend 
that a failure to raise rates to brake inflation would hurt the Fed's 
credibility and lessen its ability to control inflation in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're under considerable pressure here," said Roger Craig, portfolio 
manager at Banc One Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio. He predicted that 
yields on the 30-year Treasury bond might drift up somewhat further, to as much 
as 9.25%, over the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dederick, chief economist with Northern Trust Bank in Chicago, noted 
that two of the 11 members of the Fed committee that has primary responsibility 
for credit have recently spoken in favor of a tightening. 
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that Fed members, like some economists, might interpret the 
mixed signals coming from the economy to mean that inflation may abate as the 
year goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Dederick said the GNP figures were distorted by a "series of quirks," such as 
the effects of last year's Boeing strike, which made this year's figures look 
stronger, as well as December's sharply colder weather and auto company sales 
incentives that began in December. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in bond yields has "certainly put the issue of a rate hike on the 
table (for the Fed). But I'd want to see more evidence," Dederick said. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expect the bond market to remain spooked over the next several 
weeks for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors are worried by the prospect that the Japanese won't be as eager 
to participate in next month's $30-billion Treasury refinancing as they have in 
the past. There's anxiety, too, over a government report on employment due 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But some assert that the worries are baseless. John D. Connolly, an analyst 
with Dean Witter, says the Japanese haven't been such big buyers at the 
Treasury bond auctions after all. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, they bought a net $2.4 billion in Treasuries. The top foreign 
buyers, the British, bought a net $20.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly maintains that the absence of huge sales of high-yield certificates of 
deposit by thrifts suggests that there aren't a lot of S&amp;Ls out there with 
dire but hidden problems. 
</P>
<P>
On inflation, Connolly is reassured by the stable growth in wages, which are 
advancing at a year-to-year rate of 4%. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble in bond-land is exaggerated," he says.

'LADY DAY'S' TORTURED ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The name "Billie Holiday" sounds so carefree. 
</P>
<P>
It was a colossal misnomer, judging from Loretta Devine's anguished portrait of 
the singer in "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar &amp; Grill," at the Old Globe 
Theatre. This is a tortured artist at the end of her rope. 
</P>
<P>
Lanie Robertson's script is set rather rigidly in March, 1959, four months 
before Holiday died from heart failure, with liver and kidney complications. 
Given the time frame, it's apt that Holiday is presented in such a sad state. 
And because her greatest art was transmuted from her most agonizing pain, we 
hear some powerfully simulated samples of that art. 
</P>
<P>
As a dramatic piece, however, "Lady Day" lacks forward thrust. This is not a 
depiction of Holiday's rise and fall -- it's just a glimpse of her after she 
has fallen. The most urgent question of the evening is whether she'll collapse 
in front of our eyes. 
</P>
<P>
This Holiday does tell some funny stories from her more vigorous past. But we 
can't fully savor these stories -- or the essence of Holiday's musicianship -- 
because our attention is diverted by the necessity to diagnose her condition. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as in any show or docudrama that purports to be an accurate 
representation of a real historical figure, our attention is occasionally 
diverted by the question of how accurate it all is. Times jazz critic Leonard 
Feather, who knew Holiday well, wrote (in a generally favorable review of a Los 
Angeles production of "Lady Day" in 1987) that a few of this show's anecdotes 
"are pure fiction." 
</P>
<P>
I found myself questioning whether some of the colloquial phrases, such as "No 
way, Jose" and "my main man," were really current in 1959, and wondering why 
this Holiday recalled her father as a potential singer, instead of the 
potential trumpeter she wrote about in her autobiography, "Lady Sings the 
Blues." 
</P>
<P>
The format of the piece -- Holiday is performing in a South Philadelphia club 
but starts telling us about her life between songs -- raises a larger question 
of accuracy. In the program, one of Holiday's lifelong friends is quoted as 
saying, "She had a shyness so vast that she spoke in practically a whisper." 
Are we to believe that someone who fit that description would start blabbing 
her most intimate personal details (she was raped at 10, she says, almost as an 
aside) in front of a crowd of strangers? 
</P>
<P>
How much more intense it must have been, when the real Holiday packed all of 
her sorrow into her songs, instead of dissipating her emotions in on-stage 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Devine's performance lacks in intensity. Though she doesn't begin to 
suggest Holiday's shyness, most of the other strands of Holiday's personality 
are up there, and a couple of the songs are electrifying. When David F. Segal's 
lights go down, focusing on Devine's face at the end of "God Bless the Child," 
the atmosphere crackles. And even though Will Roberson's arena staging blocked 
my view of her face during the opening bars of "Don't Explain," Devine's voice 
was potent enough that no visual explanation was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
This was one of the moments when Devine sounded a lot like the recordings of 
Holiday. There were other moments when traces of a Broadway/gospel belting 
sound crept into the performance. But throughout, Devine took care to make it 
sound as if Holiday hadn't taken the best care of her voice. It's a courageous 
and difficult task -- to remind us not only of how great Holiday was, but also 
of how her voice was sometimes less than great. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Devine enters the bar that Robert Brill has re-created inside the 
Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage, we can tell we're not about to hear 
"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'." The theater is enveloped in a smoky haze 
(actually dry ice), and Holiday's pianist (Rahn Coleman) and sax player 
(Charles McPherson) are playing soulful, smoky jazz. (Can this show possibly 
work as well at a matinee as it does in the evening?) 
</P>
<P>
We hear Lady Day, offstage, balking at coming out to perform. When she does 
emerge and begin singing, nearly every song is accompanied by another drink. 
Devine wears a dress (costumer: Lewis Brown) that's none too flattering -- as 
if Holiday, who remarks that she once weighed 200 pounds, still has problems 
picking out the right clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Roberson's staging keeps Devine on the move, prowling through the arena, 
followed by Segal's lights. It helps disguise the fact that there isn't much 
movement within the script. A few theatergoers are seated on stage at 
cabaret-style tables -- and are served soft drinks; those seats are half price.

ODDBALL TRIPLE BILL IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By now, 11 years after its inaugural production, Long Beach Opera seems to have 
carved for itself a place in the national scene. And that place is unique. 
</P>
<P>
What, for instance, could be comparable to the oddball triple bill impresario 
Michael Milenski is presenting this week, in place of the originally promised 
(now rescheduled) "Pelleas et Melisande"? 
</P>
<P>
This three-part program, now showing in Center Theater at the Long Beach 
Convention Center, offers Pergolesi's frothy intermezzo from 1737, "Livietta 
and Tracollo," Stravinsky's non-sung entertainment, "The Soldier's Tale" (1918) 
and Mark McGurty's recent, dramatic scena, "The Anatole Cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Not a real opera in the bunch, but a fascinating evening in the operatic 
theater, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
As staged resourcefully by Nancy Keystone and Brian Kulick and conducted 
vibrantly by Richard Cordova, these pieces worked, dramatically and musically, 
and gave deep pleasures at the opening Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
With orchestras of four players, seven players and a single pianist, 
respectively, they also made aural sense in the 750-seat opera house Milenski 
likes to use -- though the last one, "The Anatole Cycle," was actually written 
for a sizable instrumental ensemble. The sound there -- even as valiantly 
played by pianist Vicki Ray -- had to disappoint for its lack of color and 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McGurty's wrenching cantata for baritone, narrator and orchestra on 
poems of grief by Stephane Mallarme, made a strong impact. Written after the 
death of the composer's friend, conductor Thomas Michalak, the half-hour piece 
probes the nature of loss and its attendant furies. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Van Derick, singing in French (Milenski and McGurty wisely eschewed an 
English translation of the baritone part), gave a powerful, faceted and 
touching performance of the half-hour work. He was assisted ably by actress 
Camille Ameen and pianist Ray. 
</P>
<P>
Another impressive baritone, Matthew Lau, dominated the chamber-size 
performance of Pergolesi's "Livietta and Tracollo," given in the English 
versions of Goldovsky and Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
With soprano Mary Paul, Lau carried out Keystone's clever but unobtrusive 
staging smoothly and gave full value to the composer's demanding and rangey 
vocal writing. They were helped in no small way by actors Scott Wade, Teresa 
Jones and Michael Rivkin. 
</P>
<P>
Kulick's pointed, surrealistic staging and the tight, no-nonsense choreography 
of Larry Hyman meshed successfully in the Stravinsky work, which was designed, 
as were the other pieces, by Mark Wendland (scenery), Christine Dougherty 
(costumes) and Kathy Pryzgoda (lighting). 
</P>
<P>
Ned Bellamy proved a charismatic Devil, Brent Hinkley a three-dimensional 
Soldier and Ameen the well-spoken Narrator in this vivid reconsideration of 
Stravinsky's piece. Christine Kellogg and Aimee Levine (the Devil's assistants) 
and Naomi Goldberg (Princess) assisted, effortlessly. 
</P>
<P>
The triple bill will be repeated Wednesday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.

'CHORUS LINE'S' LAST KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID D'ARCY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may have been the last night of Broadway's longest-running show, but the 
atmosphere was far from funereal. As the sun went down, the Shubert Theater's 
marquee for "A Chorus Line" went on turning the theater once again into the 
show business landmark it had been for the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
This time there was a new feature, the lyrics to the musical's most popular 
tune. "What I Did for Love" was flashing on a news ticker above the theater 
entrance and hundreds of fans were reading the lines of that ballad of the joys 
and frustrations of show business with tears in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't my idea" said producer Joseph Papp, who introduced the show at the 
New York Shakespeare Festival's Public Theater in April 1975, and brought it to 
Broadway the following August. "It's just too sentimental," Papp said. "The 
show's general manager put it up there and I guess I could fire him. But he'll 
be unemployed anyway after tonight." 
</P>
<P>
As the capacity audience waited more than half an hour inside the theater for 
the show to start, a neon sign with the number 6,137 showed above the stage's 
minimal set of a white line and a back wall of mirrors. Each dance number that 
featured the entire company was met with applause that sometimes drowned out 
the 17-piece orchestra, with even stronger applause at the number's end that 
sometimes went on for several minutes. As the dancers stood on their white line 
waiting for that applause to die down, some were visibly fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
The high point of Saturday night actually came after the musical's rousing 
finale, when a huge photograph of the show's creator, director/choreographer 
Michael Bennett descended from the ceiling, and the standing crowd screamed in 
approval. Bennett died of AIDS in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
An uncharacteristically emotional Papp then took to the stage to introduce each 
cast member and understudy individually, and then introduced members of the 
original company that had opened the show on Broadway. All but two of those 
dancers from 1975 came to the Shubert Theater for the final show. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour before the curtain was scheduled to rise, Papp appeared at the 
entrance to the theater to greet the crowd that had gathered. As police on 
horseback struggled to push back hundreds of fans mourning the passing of their 
favorite Broadway play, Papp repeated his reasons for deciding to close "A 
Chorus Line." "Not enough people were paying to fill the seats," Papp 
explained, "and we couldn't pay our weekly expenses." Those expenses amounted 
to $160,000 a week, a minimal weekly cost for a Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want it to go down in a way a boxer goes down on the mat," said Papp. 
"You want to go out with your head high, feeling good, like we're going out 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Papp acknowledged that he was sad about the closing of the show, but said he 
had no special words for the cast before its final performance. "I'm not a 
coach. I just walked among the troops," he said as he paused to autograph an 
original cast album for 20-year-old dancer Michael Spanelli, who was 5 when the 
show opened on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Shubert Alley was thronged with well-wishers hoping for a glimpse of the 
performers as they made their way to the stage door. Most of those fans would 
not be at Saturday evening's performance. Tickets for the final night's 
benefit, at $300 for the support of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare 
Festival, were a bit high even for hard-core admirers of "A Chorus Line." 
Still, they stood in uncommonly hot weather for late April in New York to bid 
goodby to the show. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was Stan Bloomfield, a Brooklyn high school theater teacher who had 
seen the show six times. The first of those performances was a preview before 
"A Chorus Line" debuted at the Public Theater in 1975. Bloomfield was on his 
way to another show Saturday evening, and said he had stopped off at the 
Shubert Alley, the wide mid-block passageway that runs along the Shubert 
Theater, because the closing of "A Chorus Line" was a special night for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings back nostalgia," said Bloomfield, "and it's one of the most humane, 
moving and funny shows that I've ever seen. I just wanted to be part of this 
whole experience of standing out here and hoping that I might see some of the 
original performers come home again. 
</P>
<P>
"So many musicals have good numbers," said Bloomfield, alluding to the show's 
memorable tunes and "A Chorus Line's" record 6,137 performances that brought 
6,642,400 theatergoers to the Shubert over the show's 15-year run, as well as 
$150 million. "But for me it's the warmth and the realization of all these 
characters that come to life in a period of two hours that's simply remarkable 
for a musical." 
</P>
<P>
Stage hand Frank Wauchope, who had worked on "A Chorus Line" for the show's 
first five years, had taken the night off from his job as a security man for 
Peter Schaffer's new play "Lettuce and Lovage" around the corner to see the 
final performance. "As stage hands, we can really understand the stories the 
dancers tell in the show," said Wauchope, "because it's often just as hard for 
us to get work as it is for those dancers." 
</P>
<P>
For some in the audience who had seen the show many times, Saturday night's 
performance had a new intensity. "You could tell it was different tonight," 
said 17-year-old Stephanie Friedman, from Easton, Pa., who was seeing "A Chorus 
Line" for the third time. "That made it great for us, because it was special 
for the actors and actresses as well." 
</P>
<P>
That special feeling also struck the many alumni of the show, who packed into a 
party at Mama Leone's restaurant a few doors away after the performance. "I 
thought everybody was on their toes 3,000% more than on another night where 
they wouldn't have that kind of tension associated with a closing night or with 
an audience of such big wigs," said 35-year-old Justin Ross, who played the 
role of dancer Greg Gardner for two years in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the performers were all very, very nervous," said Ross, now a 
director and producer, "and whenever performers in 'A Chorus Line' can have 
something to work their nerves, it adds to the performance, because the 
difficult thing about doing a show like this night after night is that, 
technically, it's supposed to be happening for the first time. Of course, when 
you do a show every night, it's easy to relax into the reality that you've done 
it hundreds of times. But it was thrilling, and I was thrilled to have been 
part of the show. It made me very proud. It brought back a lot of memories." 
</P>
<P>
Ross admitted that he had second thoughts about coming to the final 
performance. "My feelings were bittersweet," he reflected. " 'A Chorus Line' 
was the kind of show that you thought was going to run forever. The fact that 
it is closing is sad, but it also completes a circle. It's time for a new 
'Chorus Line.' It's time for a show that will alter people's lives in another 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Standing beside Ross was John Breglio, an entertainment lawyer who left his 
firm in 1974 to help Michael Bennett put "A Chorus Line" together. "The show 
was all Michael," said Breglio, who echoed the feelings of many original cast 
members at the party, for whom the closing of the show was another occasion to 
mourn Bennett's death three years ago. Breglio looked behind the bar at a 
life-size statue on which the number 6,137 had been placed. "I'm going to play 
that number in the lottery," he said. "That's the only way we're ever going to 
have the same kind of success that we're putting to rest tonight."

CONTROVERSIAL ARTISTS, ART ABANDONED?; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: NEA CHIEF JOHN E. FROHNMAYER APPARENTLY STEPS AWAY FROM DISPUTED WORKS. 
AT THE SAME TIME, HIS NO-SMUT OATH FOR FUNDING IS BEING QUESTIONED.

<P>
A pair of subtle developments in the political travails of the National 
Endowment of the Arts last week illustrate the intensity and risk of the 
federal arts agency's struggle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
They involve questions about the willingness of NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer 
to appear to renounce the work of two artists who have been in the vortex of 
the yearlong arts endowment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some of the NEA's most visible allies, including Rep. Sidney 
Yates (D-Ill.), have begun to express concern over Frohnmayer's decision to 
require artists and arts groups to execute an acknowledgement of what many 
construe as an anti-smut loyalty oath to get endowment support. 
</P>
<P>
On two occasions -- either occurring or disclosed last week -- Frohnmayer has 
shown he is now willing to engage in an apparent abandonment of the work of the 
late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS last year, and 
multimedia artist David Wojnarowicz, who has AIDS and has devoted his art to a 
political and social protest over the plight of its victims. 
</P>
<P>
A Wojnarowicz show, "Tongues of Flame," has been the most recent focus of 
controversy after a fundamentalist Christian group and conservative politicians 
attacked images in it as obscene and sacrilegious. 
</P>
<P>
Since before Frohnmayer's Senate confirmation last fall, politicians on both of 
the ideological sides of the NEA controversy, journalists and arts supporters 
have pressed him to state an opinion on the controversial Mapplethorpe exhibit 
"The Perfect Moment." Frohnmayer has been pressed to say if it was artistically 
meritorious and whether the NEA grant it got was a mistake. Frohnmayer has 
never committed himself. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, he seemed to abandon both Mapplethorpe and Wojnarowicz. In an 
April 20 letter to Donald Wildmon, executive director of the American Family 
Assn., based in Tupelo, Miss., Frohnmayer responded to Wildmon's objections to 
Wojnarowicz. The Wildmon group two weeks ago distributed a mailing with 
severely cropped Wojnarowicz images. The cropped details depicted sexual and 
religious protest activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The images are disgusting and offensive to me," Frohnmayer told Wildmon in his 
letter, which was released by the NEA last week, "and undoubtedly to a large 
majority of the population. I would hope that, with the procedures I am 
implementing at the arts endowment, images such as these would not again be 
funded." 
</P>
<P>
Then last Thursday, in a contentious television appearance with Wildmon, in 
which both men traded insults and cast themselves as serving Christianity, the 
debate turned to Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon demanded to know if Frohnmayer was troubled by the images. "I think 
that these photos are offensive to many people," Frohnmayer said. "That's not 
something I have funded." 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied, Wildmon pressed on. Would Frohnmayer, he asked, fund Mapplethorpe 
if the decision had been his? "Would I approve it as it is there?" Frohnmayer 
responded, gesturing to a prop Wildmon held. "The answer is 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
Apparent abandonment of the two artists came as Yates and arts supporters 
question the NEA's requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge to comply 
with anti-obscenity language in the endowment's 1990 funding law. 
</P>
<P>
The requirement has led to decisions by New York theater producer Joseph Papp 
and Venice choreographer Ferne Ackerman to decline NEA grants. Many arts groups 
are obliterating the wording or filing protests when they return the signed 
acknowledgment forms. 
</P>
<P>
But Yates and Washington arts attorney James Fitzpatrick contend the pledge may 
amount to an anti-obscenity loyalty oath. At a hearing last week, Yates 
questioned the need for the pledge, noting that other wording in the same form 
threatens art groups with debarment, a government procedure developed to combat 
gouging by defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Debarred organizations lose their ability to obtain federal grants or contracts 
from every agency of the government if they are found by any one agency to have 
violated its procedures or legal strictures. To Yates and Fitzpatrick, though, 
debarment of artists is especially threatening since an arts organization could 
get a grant for an exhibit later accused of including a single obscene work -- 
then face the prospect of long-term ineligibility for any additional government 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, I thought it important that the arts community know what the 
law is," Frohnmayer replied to Yates at the hearing. But to Fitzpatrick and 
other arts observers, the questions raised by all this have hardly been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why the NEA added this language," said Fitzpatrick, who is 
president of the board of the Washington Project for the Arts -- itself a key 
player in the controversy because it accepted the Mapplethorpe show last year 
after the Corcoran Gallery of Art here canceled it. "That is not the process 
that Congress intended," he said. "It creates more problems than it solves." 
</P>
<P>
And as to apparently abandoning Mapplethorpe, Fitzpatrick said, "I don't know 
on what grounds you could refuse to fund it." He said Mapplethorpe's work had 
been scrutinized by dozens of curators and stands as among the most socially 
telling -- if sometimes viscerally difficult -- of its time.

GARDEN GROVE SYMPHONY'S 'NIGHT AT THE OPERA' IS A LUKEWARM POTPOURRI

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't encouraging Saturday night at Don Wash Auditorium to read the printed 
program for the Garden Grove Symphony's "Night at the Opera": It announced that 
conductor Edward Peterson and singers Celeste Tavera (soprano) and Dennis 
McNeil (tenor) had up their sleeves such selections as "A rendetemi la speme 
'Quila Voce Sua Soave' " from a work apparently called "I. Puritani" by 
somebody named "Beleni," as well as "E Strana a Forsec Lui Sempre Libra," 
apparently by Verdi, and other anomalies. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson opened the potpourri proceedings with a slow, earthbound "Zauberflote" 
Overture so lacking in any Mozartean magic that even its correct designation 
seemed to be one of those malapropos program listings. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Charlton, the orchestra's principal bass player, ventured the A-major 
Concerto for Doublebass by Bottesini, a piece short on inspiration but long on 
technical demands. Charlton struggled valiantly with these, occasionally 
managing a fine run or a songful line. But the constant excursions into 
harmonics taxed him severely, as did the need to produce pure, carrying sound. 
At the high end of the pitch spectrum, intonation often was aberrant. 
</P>
<P>
Tavera and McNeil presented their credentials in arias from "Rigoletto." Her 
"Caro nome" revealed a warm, attractive middle voice, solid low register, and a 
top, not as secure, that could turn hard.

<P>
McNeil lost the rhythm immediately in a lackluster "Questa o quella" but 
recovered with the ingenuity of a real musician. His Flower Song from "Carmen" 
was decidedly better, he prescribed diminuendo on top B-flat nicely 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the Verdi excerpt proved to be the great recitative ("E strano"), 
cavatina ("Ah, fors' e lui") and cabaletta ("Sempre libera") that end the first 
act of "La Traviata," not an aria about the seventh sign in the Zodiac. 
Tavera's generalized delivery included some thin as well as lustrous sound, and 
only modest agility. In her "Puritani" aria, the subtle delicacy of Bellini's 
writing for both soloist and orchestra found no embodiment. 
</P>
<P>
In Bizet's first "Carmen" Suite, previously persistent orchestral scrappiness 
evaporated, intonation and rhythm were consistent, and the woodwinds made it 
all sing.

The tiny audience that heard Susan Rawcliffe perform with percussionist Alex 
Cline at the Newport Harbor Art Museum on Saturday night got a taste of one of 
the picturesque outposts of contemporary music, where a fascination with 
ethnological research into primitive sound-making intersects with an interest 
in offbeat sonic inventions. 
</P>
<P>
Rawcliffe designs and builds her own clay flutes and pipes, which range from 
minuscule ocarinas (flutes with mouthpieces and globular chambers that look 
rather like giant seedpods ready to burst) to a massive, tunnel-like Australian 
aboriginal didjeridu that rests on the floor or is hefted skyward in great, 
back-bending arcs. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Cline on drums and noisemakers of Javanese, African, Irish and 
Brazilian extraction -- in addition to a battery of pie pans and bowls -- 
Rawcliffe played works of varying rhythmic and harmonic complexity. 
</P>
<P>
In a solo aptly called "Duo for Me," she played vocal sounds against the 
resonant, fixed tone of the didjeridu, focusing her sounds in and around the 
long tube and breathing at different intervals to produce sounds that bleated, 
fluttered, trumpeted, hummed like machinery or pulsed like radar. The 
instrument acquired a charged, electric quality, as if it were inhabited by 
some unseen genie. 
</P>
<P>
In "Zoning," Cline produced a muted, continuous alarm-bell timbre on one, two, 
three and finally four of his small, covered saucepan-sized Javanese kulintong, 
while Rawcliffe, on a tiny ocarina, offered teakettle-like whistles, slow 
wheezes and an emotional whimpering sound that became increasingly frenzied 
before subsiding into a quiet hum. 
</P>
<P>
Other brief selections featured a water-filled pipe of Rawcliffe's own design, 
the rapid rubber-band twangs of a tiny jaw's harp and the pleasing 
harmonies-plus-drone of a triple cylindrical fipple flute. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, the composer's lithe barefoot stamps and quick forearm gestures 
focused attention on the elemental pulse of the music, which buoyed up even the 
most eccentric and unearthly sounds.

UNFOCUSED SHOW REFLECTS WEAK CURATORIAL STANCE

On the way to the Muckenthaler Cultural Center on Saturday morning, I wondered 
if there would be any place left to park. The center has been the focus of 
intensive media attention during the week, ever since trustee Beverly Gunter 
had Annie Leibovitz's photograph of rock star John Lennon removed from the 
exhibition "Heroes, Heroines, Idols &amp; Icons." 
</P>
<P>
Gunter's complaint was that the nude image of Lennon -- curled up in a fetal 
position against fully dressed Yoko Ono -- was not in keeping with the theme of 
the show. To Gunter, the show was about the "positive" portrayal of heroes. But 
then came the deluge: a barrage of phone calls, threats by three lenders to 
remove their pieces from the show, Page 1 stories in the press. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night the board voted unanimously to restore the photograph to the 
exhibit, and Gunter said she regretted her involvement in removing the work. 
Still, Curator Norman Lloyd resigned immediately after the vote, saying that 
the board was still usurping the role of professional staff in determining what 
art will be included in an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, despite reportedly heavy attendance during Friday's "A Night 
in Fullerton" arts festival, the Muckenthaler was its sleepy old self on 
Saturday. A handful of visitors drifted in, and only two were heard to inquire 
nervously about the whereabouts of "that controversial art exhibit." 
</P>
<P>
But a blank wall -- ironically, next to Leibovitz's photos -- testified to 
further reverberations. On Friday, Los Angeles collector Leonard Vernon had the 
center remove his loans of photographs by Yousef Karsh, Max Yavno, Aubrey 
Bodine and Myra Albert Wiggins. 
</P>
<P>
The whole series of events has raised issues that strike at the heart of the 
way an art institution is run. It's bad enough when an institution must battle 
outside interference. But to be censored from within is far more insidious. Had 
there not been loud and insistent nay-saying by people on the outside, it isn't 
very likely the censors would have reversed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint interview with Lloyd two years ago, center director Judy Peterson 
said the city-supported Muckenthaler was run by "a very conservative" board of 
directors and program committee. Lloyd agreed, saying that "sexual references" 
had been the prime reason for board disapproval of art in the past. 
</P>
<P>
A humble tone permeated that interview. "It's not (our) place to present us," 
Lloyd said, referring to art they personally like. "We're serving the 
community. . . . If we can appease the crowd and go assertively in the middle. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Something is wrong with this picture. The point of hiring a professional art 
staff is to allow it to use the benefit of its knowledge and contacts to 
present exhibits that lay members of the community could not have assembled on 
their own. This enterprise is not inherently democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Does a patient get to prescribe his or her own medicine? Does a defendant tell 
his attorney how to conduct the trial? Should you instruct your hairdresser on 
the proper way to do razor-cutting? Is it OK to grab a tool and help the 
repairman fix the air-conditioning? 
</P>
<P>
From the professional's point of view, "serving the community" ought to mean 
sharing with the public a personal notion of what's important and interesting 
in art, not trying to second-guess the community's standards. 
</P>
<P>
Just as good art derives from an artist's private vision -- not from a market 
survey of what people think they want to see -- good curating means following 
your own instincts about what works to show. The public is free to visit, 
exult, complain or stay away. The job of a board member is to help set overall 
policy, raise money for the institution and support the staff against misguided 
criticism from the public. 
</P>
<P>
Only the pros should be making decisions about the focus and content of the 
shows -- and they shouldn't feel compelled to censor their own ideas in order 
to keep their jobs. Think of it this way: If an art institution doesn't annoy 
some of the people all of the time, it probably isn't doing its job properly. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, though, the pattern at the county's art museums -- and not just 
the Muckenthaler -- was to hire staff the trustees figured they could boss 
around. There were no clear-cut guidelines between staff's business and board's 
business. Only when respected people with clout and a no-nonsense attitude came 
on board did the old order begin to change. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd began his career at the Muckenthaler a decade ago, working his way up to 
curator. He's not the hero of the events of last week, as some commentators 
have styled him. Rather than confronting trustee Gunter head-on -- or refusing 
in the first place to let trustees veto works of art in the show -- Lloyd spent 
days fretting about what to do until he finally decided to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Aptly enough, his last show as curator is wishy-washy and unfocused. Jumbled 
together in this show are the seeds of several discrete exhibitions. The works 
-- by famous artists, local artists, a commercial artist and obscure artists 
from the past -- deal with vastly disparate subjects, only some of which seem 
to have any bearing on heroism or idolatry. 
</P>
<P>
Step right up, folks, and see real people, imaginary people, artists portraying 
themselves, political commentary, demonstrations of the influence of artistic 
styles and symbolic imagery through the ages! 
</P>
<P>
So who has been a hero to the American people? Lloyd has lots of suggestions. 
His lineup, portrayed in paint, pencil, lithography and photo emulsion, 
includes politicians (Harry Truman, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan), film stars 
(Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland), an athlete (Willie Mays), cartoon characters 
(Mickey Mouse, Batman), musicians (singer Ella Fitzgerald, an anonymous trumpet 
player), workers (the archetypal "Ironing Woman," an anonymous steelworker), 
folk heroes (Lennon, abolitionist John Brown), fathers, mothers and -- hey, why 
not? -- some astronomers who are going to be on a PBS special. 
</P>
<P>
The viewer hasn't a clue why the homeless men in Mark Story's wirephotos should 
be perceived as heroes. (Although the photographer demanded Friday that his 
works be removed from the show as his protest against the removal of the 
Leibovitz photo, they were still on view Saturday.) Why does the show contain 
images by Leigh Weiner of the media circus surrounding the rescue efforts for a 
child who fell down an abandoned well? What is Helen Lundeberg's painting of a 
woman named Selma doing here? What was the point of including portraits of such 
an inexplicably random group of artists (Thomas Hart Benton, David Sequieros, 
Andy Warhol, Keith Haring)? 
</P>
<P>
It also makes no sense whatsoever to combine the idea of heroism and idolatry 
on a popular level with the phenomenon of artists' homages to styles and 
mythologies of ancient civilizations. That's a rich subject, but it needs its 
own exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
And how can we believe that Jasper Johns' orange, green and black American flag 
lithograph, "Moratorium" from 1964, has "nothing to do with his commentary on 
the American Flag or patriotism," as Lloyd writes in a wall label. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the piece is a visual trick (if you stare at the white dot on the flag 
and then look at the white wall, you'll see an image of the flag as its usual 
red, white and blue self). It's true that Johns began using the American flag 
as a subject back in 1955 and that he chose ordinary objects as subjects for 
his art because he was primarily interested in the phenomenon of perception. 
And yet by adding his note, Lloyd seems to be protesting too much. Why even 
bother to bring it up? 
</P>
<P>
Possibly Lloyd's statement was intended to placate conservative board members. 
If so, it shows how skewed the Muckenthaler's little world has become. Keep the 
folks happy with the Big Lie; show important American art and deny that it 
might have a political consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all its vagueness and wrongheadedness, the show (alas, so typical of 
Lloyd's nevertheless well-meaning and enthusiastic curating) does contain some 
wonderful works. 
</P>
<P>
Lundeberg's "Selma" and her youthful self-portrait at mid-century are 
broodingly poetic and exquisitely restrained paintings by a major California 
painter. Other highlights include a self-portrait lithograph by Mexican master 
David Alfaro Sequieros, a classic Robert Rauschenberg medley of news makers of 
the moment ("Signs," from 1970), Warhol's blissfully ersatz, exaggerated 
"Marilyn" silk screen from 1963, and Leibovitz's antic image of Haring, now 
dead of AIDS, cavorting in his birthday suit with a protective coating of body 
paint imitative of his well-known stick-people paintings. 
</P>
<P>
On the local front, Costa Mesa artist Frank Dixon is in top form in "New Dads," 
a wall-to-wall lineup of yuppie fathers in jackets and ties, holding ungainly 
packages of baby flesh. And newcomer David Levy's "Blue News" Cibachrome 
photograph series artfully juxtaposes cartoon images and TV news images, both 
bathed in the same eerie blue light, both eerily echoing each other's gestures. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope the next curator at the Muckenthaler carries on Lloyd's mission of 
showing serious contemporary and historical work, but within a more carefully 
reasoned framework -- and with the understanding that the board won't be free 
to perform any curatorial sleights-of-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heroes, Heroines, Idols &amp; Icons" continues through July 8 at the 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave., Fullerton. Hours: 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. Admission: free. Information: (714)

OAKLAND BALLET RECONSTRUCTS 'LE TRAIN BLEU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great secret of the Oakland Ballet's newly reconstructed "Le Train Bleu" is 
immediacy. The setting by sculptor Henri Laurens may slice an ordinary beach 
landscape into exotic Cubist planes and angles, but we instantly recognize it 
and its inhabitants: sleek bathing beauties in designer swimwear (by Coco 
Chanel, no less) and hot musclemen on the make. If we connect with this 
long-lost 1924 "operette dansee" through our own direct observation and 
experience, so do the dancers. "Train Bleu" may be a fabled relic of Serge 
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but it's also the ancestor of every surf frolic 
from "The Boy Friend" to "Beach Blanket Bingo." These young Californians 
understand it perfectly. Cast as seaside "poules" and "gigolos," they revel in 
the witty mock athleticism of Bronislava Nijinska's choreography, along with 
the preening narcissism that she so inventively filters through classical 
style. 
</P>
<P>
The pantomimic sexual byplay devised by Jean Cocteau also seems second nature 
to them -- and that's crucial, because "Train Bleu" is very much concerned with 
people selling themselves to one another. Sometimes the score by Darius Milhaud 
becomes an ironic comment on this lust-and-sand milieu -- rather like 
Nijinska's pointed references to "Giselle" and "The Sleeping Beauty" -- but 
elsewhere the use of familiar '20s idioms makes it sound like pop records 
playing in nearby hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Although both Irina Nijinska (the choreographer's daughter) and Frank W. D. 
Ries (a Cocteau specialist) had to rely on guesswork as well as scholarship in 
assembling their reconstruction, "Le Train Bleu" always feels fully alive in 
the present tense. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this insistently trivial and topical collaboration -- which also 
originally enlisted the contributions of Pablo Picasso and Anton Dolin -- seems 
infinitely closer to us than any of the dance masterworks created by Nijinska 
or her brother, Vaslav Nijinsky. As the irresistible "Beau Gosse" (Dolin's 
character), Michael Lowe can't smoothly switch between mime, gymnastics and 
classical bravura, so the role looks imposed on him rather than a 
custom-tailored tour de force. But Abra Rudisill makes every seductive flapper 
mannerism newly incendiary as "Perlouse" (originally danced by Lydia Sokolova), 
a portrayal exactly on target. 
</P>
<P>
(Oakland Ballet originally announced it would unveil this reconstruction at UC 
Irvine in February, 1989. However, the company withdrew the work following 
complaints from Irina Nijinska that she had not been consulted despite her 
claim to the copyrights of her mother's work.)

A vigorous upper-level storm hatched in the Gulf of Alaska dumped almost half 
an inch of rain in some areas of Orange County this morning, but authorities 
said the amount is not significant in easing the area's prolonged drought. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Haug, a spokesman for the county Environmental Management Agency, said 
about four-tenths of an inch was recorded in some central and southern parts of 
the county this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"This wouldn't do anything to the drought at all," Haug said. "We've given up 
on hoping (heavy rainfall) will solve the drought. We are hoping that, next 
winter, snow in the Sierras will replenish our water supply." 
</P>
<P>
The early-morning showers were blamed for 24 minor traffic accidents reported 
throughout the county before 10:30 a.m., California Highway Patrol Officer 
Linda Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the limited rainfall may complicate this year's "very 
critical" fire season, which is to open within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
"This little rainfall causes some growth, which then dries up very quickly and 
adds more fuel to the already-dry countryside," said Kathleen Cha, a 
spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
There is a slight chance later today of more showers in the mountain regions of 
the county, according to WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Lows tonight will be in the mid-40s to mid-50s. 
</P>
<P>
WeatherData meteorologist Rick Dittmann said clear skies and slightly warmer 
temperatures are predicted for Tuesday.

U.S. AND SOUTH YEMEN TO RENEW TIES AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS

The United States and South Yemen announced today that they are restoring 
diplomatic relations after a lapse of more than 20 years despite U.S. concerns 
that the Marxist country has aided terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made simultaneously in Washington and South Yemen, came on 
the day that the State Department released its annual list of countries that 
support terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
South Yemen was included on the list because of evidence that it has supplied 
safe haven for international terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the decision to resume 
diplomatic relations was made independently of South Yemen's record on 
terrorism and was in line with the U.S. policy to have normal relations with as 
many nations in the world as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said, "We are pleased at this restoration, and seek a useful 
productive relationship." 
</P>
<P>
South Yemen -- known formally as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen -- 
broke relations with the United States in October 1969, accusing the United 
States of meddling in its internal affairs. The restoration of relations comes 
at a time when South Yemen and non-Marxist North Yemen are talking of the 
possibility of political and economic reunification.

No date was given but papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said it will be soon. 
Romanian officials said in Bucharest that ties would be restored in mid-May.

The fall of the hard-line Communist regimes in Central Europe over the past

Attorneys for Manuel Noriega said today that they are filing a motion to 
withdraw from the case because the U.S. government has frozen all their 
client's money. 
</P>
<P>
"There are millions of dollars in bank accounts that are frozen, even though 
under the government's contention, they are not subject to the forfeiture law," 
said Jon May, one of Noriega's four attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking for any funds that would be tainted." 
</P>
<P>
May said the defense has received only "a few thousand dollars" for expenses 
since Noriega's capture, and nothing in fees. 
</P>
<P>
He said the defense now needs money to travel, take depositions and do research 
but lacks the resources because of the frozen bank accounts. "But the 
government is refusing to even negotiate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the attorneys' motion to withdraw is not automatic, and must 
be approved by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler. 
</P>
<P>
May blamed the Bush Administration for the decision to freeze all of Noriega's 
accounts, rather than the U.S. attorney's office in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is spending $20 million to $30 million on their case," said 
another defense attorney, Steven Kollin. "We don't need anywhere near that 
amount, but we may need $5 million to defend Gen. Noriega."

VIDEO FAKED, EXPERTS SAY; CEAUSESCUS KILLED EARLIER

A Romanian government videotape purporting to show the execution of Romanian 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, is faked in part, forensic 
experts here believe. 
</P>
<P>
After examining a 90-minute tape shown last week on French television, the 
scientists doubt the official claim that the couple were killed by firing 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they say the couple were apparently killed hours earlier with gunshots 
in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist dictator and his wife were tried and executed Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Loic le Ribault, director of a private criminal science laboratory in 
Bordeaux, said Sunday that the only signs of fatal wounds on the bodies were in 
the right temples, indicating that the Ceausescus had been shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
In the tape, the Ceausescus, hands tied behind their backs, appear in the video 
to have been gunned down with automatic weapons. But the camera angle is too 
low and the lens is obscured by gun smoke, preventing a clear look at the 
couple being shot, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Later footage shows a medic checking Elena Ceausescu for signs of life as she 
lies in a stream of blood pouring from a wound in her head. 
</P>
<P>
Le Ribault and others say the state of the bodies shows that the Ceausescus 
died hours before the medic checked them. The corpses were stiff with rigor 
mortis, and there was virtually no sign of blood on Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the bullet holes on the brick wall behind the couple are too low for a 
firing squad theoretically aiming at the chest, Le Ribault said. 
</P>
<P>
The director of Free Romanian Television, Razvan Theodorescu, defended the 
authenticity of the tape and called it a historic document.

JUSTICES UPHOLD DRUG TESTING OF TRANSPORT STAFF

The Supreme Court today approved another controversial government drug-testing 
program, allowing mandatory random urinalysis for 30,000 air traffic 
controllers, railroad inspectors and other Transportation Department workers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest ruling in which the nation's high court sided with the 
government since its landmark decision last year upholding drug and alcohol 
tests for U.S. Customs agents and railroad employees involved in accidents or 
safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the Supreme Court allowed drug tests for Justice Department workers 
with top-secret clearance and for Army civilian drug counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nine high court members, only Justice Thurgood Marshall voted to review 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Appealing to the Supreme Court were labor groups representing government 
workers, which argued that the random tests violate the constitutional Fourth 
Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Department officials approved a drug-testing program in 1987. 
Nearly two-thirds of the workers who must undergo the random, periodic 
urinalysis tests are air traffic controllers. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, the justices today refused to revive a lawsuit that sought to 
strip the Roman Catholic Church of its tax-exempt status because of its 
anti-abortion activities. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that abortion rights advocates 
lack the legal standing to sue the federal government for revocation of the 
church's tax exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Among those challenging the church's exemption were Abortion Rights 
Mobilization Inc., the National Women's Health Network Inc. and the Long Island 
National Organization for Women in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said the Catholic Church violated Internal Revenue Service rules by 
lobbying against abortion rights and contributing to political candidates who 
oppose abortion. The IRS generally bars tax-exempt groups from engaging in such 
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, voting 2 to 1, threw out the suit last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said the lawsuit accuses the IRS of creating "an uneven 
playing field tilted to favor the Catholic Church." But the appeals court said 
the abortion rights groups lack standing to make that argument because they are 
not engaged in lobbying or making political contributions.

The Seabrook nuclear power plant has been shut down for the third time in less 
than six weeks, prompting critics to converge on the state capital today to 
call for the reactor to be junked. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had hoped the $6.5-billion plant would produce its first 
nuclear-generated electricity early this week. 
</P>
<P>
But Seabrook spokesman David Scanzoni said that milestone has now been pushed 
back until late May at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Sher, spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee, the utility that runs the plant, 
said the reactor was brought to a halt Saturday night to modify a turbine on 
its non-nuclear side. He said the shutdown will last four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Morrison of the Clamshell Alliance called the plant "a piece of junk" and 
said the shutdown is another example of why Seabrook shouldn't be allowed to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook, which was originally scheduled to begin operating in 1979, has been 
plagued by regulatory delays and cost overruns that drove its owner, Public 
Service Co. of New Hampshire, to seek bankruptcy protection in 1988.

Nationwide Insurance said today that it is holding to its decision to reject 
claims filed by an agency that offers therapy for Alzheimer's disease victims 
in Ohio. A spokesman for the agency said the program will fold. 
</P>
<P>
The company's decision, announced in an unsigned statement, came after the 
company reviewed claims filed by Toledo-based Intergenerational Services Inc., 
a nonprofit agency that offers therapeutic services to Alzheimer's patients in 
66 nursing home in 15 northwest Ohio counties. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus-based Nationwide, which administers the Medicare program in Ohio, 
contends that the activities that Intergenerational offers to Alzheimer's 
patients are recreational and social, not psychotherapy. The services, in the 
company's view, therefore do not qualify for even partial reimbursement under 
the government's medical insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
Intergenerational said today that it will go out of business because of 
Nationwide's policy, because it cannot afford to continue operations during an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they are going to appeal Nationwide's decision, they're going to 
be phasing out the program," Stan Collins, an agency spokesman, said. "They 
just can't stay in business."

BUSH DEFENDS JAPAN FAIR TRADE DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
UNFAIR PRACTICES: PRESIDENT VOWS TO 'USE ALL TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL' TO OPEN 
ASIAN MARKET TO U.S. PRODUCTS.

<P>
President Bush, defending his decision to drop unfair-trade charges against 
Japan, vowed today to "use all the tools at our disposal," including threats of 
retaliation if necessary, to open the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Bush said his decision last Friday 
no longer to cite Japan for unfair-trading practices "does not mean that all of 
our problems with Japan have disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed to recent concessions by Japan as evidence of unprecedented 
progress in easing trade tensions and said Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu "shares our commitment to ensuring that trade strengthens rather than 
undermines the friendship between our nations." 
</P>
<P>
"We know that we could sell more American products if Japan's market were truly 
open," he said, "but we've been working hard on it and I think with impressive 
results." 
</P>
<P>
Under the "Super 301" section of the 1988 omnibus trade law, the Administration 
is required to identify countries targeted for investigations of unfair trading 
practices and the prospect of retaliation in the event that negotiations fail 
to resolve those disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japan, India and Brazil were all designated. Facing an April 30 
deadline for a new round of Super 301 cases, Bush said Friday that only India, 
because of its refusal to enter into negotiations, would continue to be cited. 
</P>
<P>
His decision angered some members of Congress fighting for tougher treatment of 
the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush said the resolution of last year's three specific complaints 
against Japan under Super 301 -- over supercomputers, satellites and forest 
products -- and recent promises of economic reforms that would make the 
Japanese market more competitive and stimulate demand for imported goods 
provide reason to "look forward to substantial progress." 
</P>
<P>
To those members of Congress who accused him of being too quick to accept 
Japanese promises in place of concrete action, Bush told the Chamber of 
Commerce audience, "We're going to continue to press for progress."

The Milwaukee Journal has pulled advertisements featuring Polish leader Lech 
Walesa speaking in broken English after complaints that the ad amounted to an 
ethnic slur. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal used newspaper, television and radio advertisements featuring 
Walesa and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to promote its new page 
designs, unveiled in April. 
</P>
<P>
The Walesa newspaper advertisement on April 23 showed a photo of the founder of 
Poland's Solidarity movement with the words: "Very long I have hoped for 
changes so significant as those in new Milwaukee Journal." 
</P>
<P>
The Thatcher ad pictures the prime minister with the words, "Why yes, the 
American colonies have progressed. Consider the recent changes in your 
Milwaukee Journal." 
</P>
<P>
Both ads involved contrived quotes. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dye, spokesman for the Journal, said that the ads were intended to be 
"lighthearted spoofs" and that both were pulled.

Western Union Co., seeking to avoid bankruptcy court, said today it has filed a 
restructuring plan based on swapping $530 million in notes for new securities 
with lower rates and a longer repayment schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission comes as the company 
faces a June 15 deadline to make a $51-million biannual interest payment. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the plan, the company would exchange up to $530 million in 
principal amount of outstanding debt for new debt securities and common shares 
and for a reclassification of outstanding preferred shares. 
</P>
<P>
Western Union officials told regulators in March that the company might have to 
seek bankruptcy court protection if it could not meet its debt interest 
payments.

Soviet ballerina Natalia Makarova and her husband have their 18th-Century 
violins back, including the Stradivarius that was snatched in a daring burglary 
at their house. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Sunday evening arrested Robert Fisher, 27, of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The recovered Stradivarius was worth more than $1 million. The other violin, a 
Guarnerius, was valued at about $1 million, police spokesman David Ambrose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The violins, jewelry and a pair of Chinese enameled statuettes were among items 
stolen Saturday from the home of Makarova and her husband, Edward Karkar. 
Makarova, 49, recently retired from the American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's 1986 Mercedes-Benz was also stolen. Police said Fisher was 
arrested as he walked away from the car after parking it about a mile from the 
house. Most of the stolen items were in the car, Ambrose said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, he didn't realize what he had taken. For that we can be thankful," 
said Karkar. The violins are his, and he said he practices on them regularly.

The movie "Roger and Me" is a hit in Eastern Europe because it shows audiences 
what 80 years of capitalism have done to the General Motors Corp. company town

But Moore said Warner Brothers, which distributed his documentary film about GM 
layoffs and his comically futile efforts to interview Chairman Roger Smith, is 
happy with "Roger and Me" for reasons different than his. 
</P>

The film has grossed more than $7 million since its release in January and 
still plays in 35 U.S. cities, Moore said Saturday at a fund raiser for a 
legislative candidate.

"Warner Brothers is not promoting the film because they are at the forefront of 
political revolution," he said. "They're doing it because they think it will

of complications from the disease, hospital officials said today.

<P>
Shawn learned that he was infected with the AIDS virus in late 1987 shortly 
before he became the choreographer for "Legs Diamond." He was dismissed from 
his job and sued the producers for $2.75 million in a case that many thought at 
the time could provide a legal precedent for AIDS discrimination cases. But the 
case was settled out of court.

'NINJA TURTLES' SUCCUMBS TO A 'WOMAN'

After four weeks in the No. 1 spot at the nation's box office, "Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles" was finally beaten at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Touchstone's romantic comedy, "Pretty Woman" starring Richard Gere and Julia 
Roberts, had weekend ticket sales of about $7.3 million to edge New Line 
Cinema's green wonders out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
With ticket sales of about $6.7 million, the turtles had to settle for second. 
</P>
<P>
But the turtles are still the apparent victors in the race toward the lofty 
$100-million mark. To date, moviegoers have shelled out about $96 million for 
the Turtles, while "Pretty Woman" has sold about $80 million in tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a critical clobbering, Universal Pictures' "The Guardian," directed by 
William Friedkin ("The Exorcist"), scared up ticket sales of about $5.7 million 
for third place. In release at about 1,685 theaters, the horror entry had a 
per-screen-average of about $3,400. 
</P>
<P>
In fourth place was Touchstone's out-ot-this-world comedy, "Spaced Invaders." 
It earned about $4.7 million at 1,821 screens, for about $2,580 per screen. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures' "The Hunt for Red October" edged closer to the $100-million 
target. With weekend ticket sales of about $2.9 million, it ranked fifth, with 
grosses of more than $99 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star Pictures' gritty police drama "Q &amp; A," directed by Sidney Lumet 
and starring Nick Nolte, had less-than-arresting ticket sales of about $2.8 
million at 912 screens for sixth place -- about $3,200 per screen. This was 
despite largely positive critical notices.

Eastern Illinois University is honoring one of its dropouts, folk singer Burl 
Ives. 
</P>
<P>
The university named an art studio after the 81-year-old folk singer and actor, 
who enrolled at the college in 1929 but dropped out in his third year as his 
grades slipped. 
</P>
<P>
Ives said it felt good to be back at Eastern, despite not having a degree. He 
said he hoped that people who use the building will follow his example and go 
where their creativity takes them. After leaving college, Ives' wanderings as a 
hobo and as a troubadour took him through 46 states, and he memorized about 500 
folk songs.

Lucie Arnaz says her mother, Lucille Ball, kept her television on almost all

</P>
<P>
"I don't think she liked sitcoms very much in general after a while," Arnaz 
said in the May 7 issue of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"But she did like to watch 'Wheel of Fortune.' Every night. Whenever we were 
eating dinner, it was always on. I guess that's a sitcom in itself." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ball died in April, 1989.

Arnaz is the host for tonight's airing on CBS of the 34-minute pilot of "I Love 
Lucy," taped in March, 1951, and never before seen on television.

"I thought maybe the pilot would make me cry or something, but I just laughed,"

RAIDERS WANT HARRIS, QB'S AGENT SAYS

The agent for former West Virginia quarterback Major Harris says the Raiders 
have asked him to suspend negotiations with a Canadian football team. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Abram said Sunday that he and Harris were ready to go to Vancouver for talks 
with the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League when the 
Raiders contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
"They are serious," Abram told the Dominion Post in an interview published 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"(Raiders Coach) Art Shell is going to call me," Abram said. "They have been in 
contact often. . . . Things have changed a little. They have asked us to hold 
off talks with BC until certain things have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Abram said the Raiders' hiring of former Illinois head coach Mike White as 
special projects coach could bode well for Harris, who gave up his final year 
of college football eligibility to seek a professional career. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike White is a quarterback coach," Abram said. "He works well with them. . . 
. What is more of a special project than Major Harris?" 
</P>
<P>
Abram said the Raiders are "extremely serious" about signing Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the Raiders and they go against the grain on a lot of different 
things," Abram said. "All indications are they are not even remotely thinking 
about (paying) 12th-round money. That's one of the things that got our 
attention. We were told not to worry about 12-round money." 
</P>
<P>
Abram said he is pleased with the way contract negotiations have gone with the 
Raiders and the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody seems to be concerned and showing that Major is wanted," Abram said. 
"At this point we are extremely optimistic that by May 7 or 8 Major will be in 
the Raider camp full time or in Vancouver."

DRIVER BARCLAY'S CONDITION IMPROVES

Orange County race car driver Steve Barclay was moved from critical care to a 
regular room today and his condition was upgraded to good, a spokesman at 
Methodist Hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
Barclay, 45, of Orange suffered a concussion and broken arm, wrist, collarbone 
and ribs in a crash Friday during the Rookie Orientation Program at the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said Barclay was continuing to improve, although they gave no 
indication when he would be released, Methodist spokesman Jon White said. 
</P>
<P>
Barclay was originally listed in serious condition after his crash in the 
second turn. He had driven 56 laps with a fast lap at 189.673 before his 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The wreck, which ended Barclay's long-held dream of starting in the 
Indianapolis 500, occurred as his Buick-powered Lola darted to the right in the 
second turn, striking the outside concrete barrier and rocketing across the 
track into the other wall. 
</P>
<P>
The car slid several hundred feet with its bottom pinned against the side of 
the wall. Barclay was knocked unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
A California land developer, Barclay had been racing for only five years, and 
the major achievement for the former UCLA lineman was winning the hard luck 
award in the West Coast Formula Atlantic series.

The U.S. Supreme Court today refused to reinstate an award of nearly $1 million 
won, then lost, by former professional basketball player Ron Behagen against an 
amateur basketball group. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that 
threw out Behagen's award. 
</P>
<P>
Behagen, who sells insurance in the Atlanta area, has been battling in federal 
court since 1982 with the Amateur Basketball Assn. of the United States and its 
executive director, William Wall. The organization is now known as USA 
Basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Behagen said the association violated federal antitrust law and his 
constitutional rights by playing a pivotal role in ending his career with a 
Sienna, Italy, team after he left the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury in Denver agreed and awarded him $684,000. A federal judge 
tacked on $180,476 in attorney's fees and court costs, plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the award, prompting 
Behagen's appeal to the high court.

MELVIN DURSLAG: DAYS OF SORE ARMS ARE GONE; NOW IT'S A LABRUM PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orel Hershiser's surgery seemed to required reconstruction of the anterior 
capsule, reposing in the area of the glenoid labrum. 
</P>
<P>
"I know all about labrum," Tom Lasorda, scholarly manager of the Dodgers, 
explained. "When I was living in Norristown, a judge gave someone in our 
neighborhood 10 years of hard labrum." 
</P>
<P>
With Jay Howell, the problem seemed to be a partial tear in the medial meniscus 
in the left knee. 
</P>
<P>
And Eric Davis, the Cincinnati outfielder currently inoperative? He is 
suffering a sprain of the medial collateral, a disorder not foreign to Lasorda, 
who will tell you that collateral is what you put up when you borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
Tom's colleague, Don Zimmer, manager of the Chicago Cubs, smiles thinly, 
reflecting on today's medical reports. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new world, isn't it?" Don says. "I am glad to have lived during a time 
when guys had sore arms and bum knees." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean no one got a medial menisectomy?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked around with knots on our knees," he says. "And pitchers rested their 
arms during the winter. Maybe conditions are better today, but when I see Nolan 
Ryan throw a one-hitter and strike out 16 at the age of 43, I have yet to be 
convinced that pitching regularly can break down arms. Three days' rest, four 
days' rest, eight days' rest -- I see it mainly as luck." 
</P>
<P>
If Zimmer is wrong, why would Jeff Hamilton, a strong young stud for the 
Dodgers, go out of business throwing only from third to first? 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton is recovering from a damaged rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
So is Pat Perry, a relief pitcher the Dodgers pick up this year. Perry pitches 
only 35.2 innings last year for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
From Pittsburgh, the Dodgers also capture pitcher Jim Gott, and what they get 
in Gott is a have-not, an entertainer with a bad elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Their relief catcher, Rick Dempsey, is out with a bad back, and medical science 
has worked hard but hasn't yet diagnosed fully the case of Kirk Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
In his time, trouble has visited the hamstring, the knee, the calf, the ankle 
and the wrist of Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to problems with the rib cage and the stomach muscles. 
</P>
<P>
No abnormality has been sighted in the area of the glenoid labrum, but Gibson 
has yet to play this year, compounding Dodger frustration in the area of 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
Great hosannas are heard when they unload Pedro Guerrero, who, to management, 
was a pain in the anterior capsule. 
</P>
<P>
They give him to the Cardinals for John Tudor, a pain in the rectus abdominis. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Guerrero hits up a storm in St. Louis and Tudor goes bad in Los Angeles, 
so he is given back to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
At the last inspection, he wins his first four starts this year, ironically at 
the time Hershiser is hurt, Howell is hurt, Gott is hurt and Perry is hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Stuck for a fifth starting pitcher, the Dodgers would go with a rotation of 
four, except it is felt that the arm of Fernando Valenzuela right now might not 
respond to such a schedule. 
</P>
<P>
And what happened to Steve Sax? The Dodgers allowed him to drift to the 
Yankees, for whom he hit .315 last year. 
</P>
<P>
And Mariano Duncan, who shows no promise that is visible in Los Angeles, is 
shifted to Cincinnati, where he is off to the hottest start of his existence. 
</P>
<P>
Incredible things have been happening to the Dodgers; yet, for all their 
crises, they are playing .550, for which apologies aren't required. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of a season," Lasorda is asked, "does anyone pay attention to 
injuries that occurred?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not in the least," he answers. "There are no asterisks that explain you had 
seven guys hurt at one time. You are told everyone has injuries. And no one 
wants to hear you complain. It's like I always have said -- 80% of the people 
don't care about your troubles. And the other 20% are glad you got 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Lasorda, hobbling about on a bad knee, could use a medial 
menisectomy, which isn't related to a vasectomy, but he resists surgery, 
opting, instead, for a program of physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got me swimming almost every day," Tom says. "Exercising in the water 
is supposed to be good for the knee." 
</P>
<P>
In his last days in football, Joe Namath was advised to swim to ease chronic 
knee problems. Joe never returned to his old form as a quarterback, but he was 
always clean. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda uses the pool of the Police Academy, which is close to Dodger Stadium. 
Asked if he is a good security risk, he answers: 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I have never stolen anything except signs." 
</P>
<P>
How the Dodgers will compensate for the loss of Hershiser isn't easy to figure, 
but it is hoped that, after 3 1/2 hours of surgery, the anterior capsule will 
function as it used to and not start trouble with the pectoralis major. 
</P>
<P>
Up until now, Hershiser never had anything worse than an appendectomy, if you 
don't want to count the times he had his teeth cleaned.

JACK CLARK STRUGGLED IN 1989 UNTIL HE RESURRECTED AN OLD BATTING STANCE AND

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Clark has been in baseball 13 seasons, played for 10 managers and been 
employed by four organizations. 
</P>
<P>
He has been an All-Star. He has been a bum. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a town hero; he has been ridiculed by what seemed to be entire 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured there was nothing left, you know, that I already hadn't been through 
before," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
But he never imagined a slump like last season's. It terrified him, frightened 
his family and closest friends, and it left him wondering for the first time if 
he still wanted to play this game. 
</P>
<P>
Few knew the pain and torment that Clark endured. Even his teammates were 
unaware of his anguish. 
</P>
<P>
"I never let on what I was going through," said Clark, the Padres' first 
baseman. "Until now, I never really was able to discuss it. I mean, people knew 
I wasn't happy, but no one knew just how miserable I was. 
</P>
<P>
"The pain was just too much. I just couldn't talk about it. But I'm telling you 
right now, I've never gone through a more miserable time in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Clark remembers waking in the middle of the night, glancing at her 
husband and seeing him staring at the ceiling. The kids remember seeing their 
dad standing in front of a mirror, practicing his weight-shift with an 
imaginary bat. His parents remember the phone calls from Clark's friends and 
acquaintances, all offering suggestions on how he could get out of the slump. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scraping the bottom of the barrel and had such a bad taste in my mouth 
that there were days when I just dreaded coming to the ballpark," he said. "I 
was questioning myself. I was doubting myself. Really, I was just totally, 
utterly disgusted with myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I was even having friends calling me from high school offering suggestions, 
that's how bad it was. I totally had no concept of what I was doing at the 
plate, and even when I got a hit, I had no idea how it happened. I literally 
forgot how to hit. Eventually, I just started looking for a walk every time I 
came up, because I knew I wasn't going to hit my way on." 
</P>
<P>
He was convinced he'd be traded. Maybe even given away. But then he thought, 
who in their right mind would pay $2 million a year to a guy who was hitting 
.219 with only nine homers through June, having already accumulated 90 
strikeouts? 
</P>
<P>
"They probably had no choice but to keep me," Clark said, "with the way I was 
going. I'm sure my market-value had hit the bottom of the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so bad because Jack (McKeon, the Padre manager) did so much to bring me 
over from New York, and here I was, letting everyone down." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were floundering. He was being booed the moment he left the on-deck 
circle for the walk to home plate. And instead of becoming infuriated, Clark 
wondered if he was finished. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we contributed to his problems, too," McKeon said. "We put all the 
pressure on him. We just sat around waiting for him to hit a homer, and when he 
didn't, we had absolutely nothing left to fall back on." 
</P>
<P>
Then one day, maybe it was on June 26, an idea suddenly struck. It seemed 
crazy. Maybe even absurd. "But with the way I was hitting," he said, "how much 
worse could I look?" 
</P>
<P>
Clark reverted to the batting stance he had abandoned almost 10 years ago in 
San Francisco. He squared his shoulders. He stood a little closer to the plate. 
The bat was held higher. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was giving up on what got me my most success," Clark said, "but I had 
to give this a fair chance. Really, that's how desperate I was." 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, it came along. He got two hits on June 27, and before he knew it, he 
had a 14-game hitting streak. He knew he had something special going, but still 
the home runs had yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning on July 18, they came. He launched 17 homers the remainder of the 
season, driving in 55 runs with a .269 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
Jack the Ripper -- the nickname bestowed upon him nine years ago by Vida Blue 
-- was back. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres finished the 1989 season as the hottest team in baseball, winning 29 
of their final 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the team has superstars. It has six All-Star players, one former 
most-valuable-player award winner and eight who have played in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
But this has become Clark's team. There is no title, and there are plenty of 
veterans to shoulder the burden, but Clark has emerged as the team leader, the 
man to whom everyone must answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's why it was eating him up so much last year," said Padre catcher 
Mark Parent. "More than anything, he wanted to be the team leader. But when 
you're struggling, you can't do that. Nobody is going to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see him now. He's not afraid to get on anybody. He'll get on Eric 
Show, (Bruce) Hurst, Benny (Benito Santiago), it doesn't matter who they are. 
He's our enforcer, is what he is." 
</P>
<P>
It's no coincidence this spring that Santiago is much more relaxed and has 
become outgoing in the clubhouse. It's no coincidence that second baseman 
Roberto Alomar is keeping quiet about his talents, refusing to predict his 
stardom as he did a year ago. And it's no coincidence that Mike Pagliarulo, 
Darrin Jackson, Phil Stephenson, Jerald Clark and Parent have accepted their 
backup roles this season without uttering so much as a hint of displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Clark's influence on the Padres comes as no surprise to St. Louis 
Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog. During Clark's three-year stay in St. Louis, 
the Cardinals were in the World Series twice, and Clark was an All-Star twice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's much doubt what he did for us," Herzog said. "We haven't 
been back to the World Series since, have we?" 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who hit 26 homers and drove in 94 runs last year and averaged 29 homers 
and 98 RBIs the past three seasons, remains perhaps the National League's 
best-kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
He's not a glory seeker, starving for media coverage. You won't see him hawking 
goods on the airwaves. He refused to pursue endorsements after his 
pennant-winning home run against the Dodgers in 1985. He never involves himself 
in clubhouse pranks. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Anthony Clark was raised in the old school of baseball. Sweat, dirt and an 
honest day's effort is his calling card. He's not particularly smooth or 
diplomatic when it comes to interviews. 
</P>
<P>
When reporters clamor around him after games, wanting fancy, concocted answers 
on how he was able to hit a ball 475 feet for a homer, the reply is simple: 
</P>
<P>
"When I hit 'em right, they're going to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When his right ankle begins throbbing -- caused by torn ligaments that never 
healed properly in 1987 -- and the pain is unbearable, Clark just tells Padre 
trainer Dick Dent to wrap the ankle a little tighter. There hasn't been a day 
he hasn't played in pain since being with the Padres, he said. But if the ankle 
is the reason he didn't get over and make a play that should have been made, 
you'll never hear him use it as an alibi. 
</P>
<P>
When he learned that McKeon decided to use him in the cleanup spot and bat Joe 
Carter fifth, instead of rejoicing, he wanted to talk to McKeon. He was making 
sure that this was not a gesture to satisfy Clark's ego. He's not concerned 
about where he's batting in the lineup, as long as he's in it. 
</P>
<P>
People learn quickly about Clark: It's not wise to mess with the man. Don't 
come downstairs, wearing suit and suspenders, trying to tell him how to act so 
that your corporate sponsors are happy. Don't tell him what to say, because 
he'll say whatever he pleases. And don't dare try to change the way he plays. 
</P>
<P>
Just give him a bat and glove, surround him by teammates whose main objective 
is winning and weed out the prima donnas. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Clark has played with three teams, in two leagues in 
three regions. His teams have averaged a 90-72 record during the past five 
years. Only once did one of Clark's teams fail to have a winning record. That 
was in 1986 with the Cardinals. It was the year Clark suffered torn ligaments 
in his right hand, limiting him to 65 games. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is a winner," McKeon said, "and in this game that's about the highest 
compliment you can make about someone. He's a born leader, and no matter what 
he does on that field, he's going to make your team better. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I just so happen to believe he's going to have one hell of a season 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Clark and his wife have spent the past three years decorating and furnishing 
their Bay Area home in Danville with every conceivable luxury. There's a 
fountain in the back yard complete with a view of undeveloped green slopes and 
a golf course. There's a saltwater aquarium built into the wall. There's a 
billiard room. There are keypads in every room of the house, allowing anyone to 
listen to the music of their choice from the stereo, cassette deck or 
compact-disc player. He has everything you can possibly imagine and then some. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to move. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is waiting for the Padres to approach him with a contract extension. He'd 
like a four-year deal, five years would be better. The minute the contract is 
signed, he said, the "For Sale" sign on his house will be up, and he will comb 
the San Diego area for a home. Maybe Rancho Santa Fe, perhaps Del Mar, possibly 
Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay right here, finish out my playing career and live here the rest 
of my life," Clark said. "I really love where I am. San Diego is as good a 
place as there is in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm in Europe or Maui or 
something. Really, I just love California, especially Southern California. I 
love the mountains. I love the beaches. I love the weather. I even like the 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where I want to be, and I sure the hell don't ever want to go back to 
the American League. I hate that damn league. This is the real game, that stuff 
is make-believe. Every game of theirs lasts 3 1/2, four hours. No wonder the 
fans are bored over there, because so are the players." 
</P>
<P>
Though Clark says he wants to stay with the Padres, he refuses to initiate 
contract talks. He's been through this so many times before, and it's about 
time, he says, that he is shown respect. 
</P>
<P>
"For once," he said, "I'm going to try to test the system and believe that it 
will be fair to both sides. For once, I'd like them to come to me. I'm not 
going to go begging and pleading for a job. I just want them to be fair to me, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's bitterness for baseball's establishment stems largely from the past few 
years. When he became a free agent after the 1987 season with the Cardinals, 
they refused to give him a raise, offering him a two-year, $2.6 million 
contract. Not only would it be their only offer, Cardinal General Manager Dal 
Maxvill said, but no other teams would even submit one. 
</P>
<P>
Say hello to Collusion III. 
</P>
<P>
"They bad-mouthed me and told me to take it or leave it," Clark said. "I said, 
'Leave it.' They said, 'Well, you've got two options then. Go drive a truck or 
go play for Cleveland.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yankee principal owner George Steinbrenner, who never has been one to go along 
with the rest of the owners, signed Clark to a three-year, $6-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Say goodby to collusion. 
</P>
<P>
Clark played a year for the Yankees, but he felt more like he was in a prison 
than in a ballpark. He requested a trade at the end of the season, and for 
awhile, it appeared he would be heading to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
But as Clark will tell you, "George hates the Dodgers." Clark was traded to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The bitterness of leaving St. Louis still burns deep, and the way he figures 
it, he wasted 1 1/2 years of his career because of collusion. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's ready for a pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
"It tees me off whenever I think about it," Clark said. "One day I'd just love 
to get ahold of one of those . . . owners and let them know what I really think 
of them. I was the one who paved the way for a lot of these guys, and they're 
the ones getting rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at Will Clark's contract (four years, $15 million), and I'm thinking, 
'Give me a break.' How long has the guy been around, four years? And they're 
just giving away money just because the guy's eligible for arbitration. I 
worked my whole life for something like that, and when my turn comes for free 
agency, there's collusion. I didn't get a damn offer until Steinbrenner's. 
</P>
<P>
"And now they're paying a guy like Will Clark like he's in the Hall of Fame. 
People in San Francisco say that he's the best player to ever play for them. 
The Thrill, he's better than Willie McCovey? Right. You've got to be kidding 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why this whole thing gets to me. A lot of guys like myself have had to 
go to war or battle just to get an offer. And now they're giving it away. 
</P>
<P>
"When my day in court comes this winter (for collusion damages), I want some 
pay-back, and I want it good. There's going to be stuff that comes out that 
they never heard before. They keep trying to bust our union, and it's just not 
going to work. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'd love to stay here and forget about all this bull. I want this 
to be my last contract. I paid my dues, now I'd like to get rewarded." 
</P>
<P>
After a hot spring and first 16 games of the regular season in which he hit 
.273, he struggled in the Pittsburgh series this weekend and has tailed off to 
.204, but with four home runs and nine RBIs. The Padres, Clark's team, also 
struggled against the Pirates, losing all three games. 
</P>
<P>
Clark isn't predicting his accomplishments for the season, but considering that 
he feels just as good at the plate as he did at the end of last season, he 
provided a hint of what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hit them," he said, "they're going to go. They're going to go high. 
They're going to go far. They're going to go low. And they're going to go long. 
And when I have that feeling, you have the feeling that you're invincible. You 
feel nothing is impossible."

<P>
At first blush, Nampet Panichpant-M might seem an unlikely lieutenant in Orange 
County's new war on smoking and tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
Petite and manicured and looking younger than 41, she is the scion of a wealthy 
tobacco family from the fertile land of the Golden Triangle, an area where 
Thailand, Laos and Burma meet and where tobacco and opium grow on lush farms. 
</P>
<P>
"My family has been involved in the tobacco plantation for some time. My 
mother's side is still involved," said Panichpant-M, director of the county 
Health Care Agency's immigrant services. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me the Pat Reynolds of Thailand," she quipped in a reference to the 
wealthy R.J. Reynolds tobacco heir who has become a leader in the national 
anti-smoking movement. 
</P>
<P>
In her drab cubbyhole of a county office on 17th Street, Panichpant-M is 
helping to map the county's strategy for a two-year, $2.9-million anti-tobacco 
campaign targeted at minorities. The effort will be paid for with the county's 
share of the Proposition 99 statewide tax, which added 25 cents to the cost of 
a pack of cigarettes in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to build a network of educational and counseling 
services, including a 24-hour multilingual hot line. Panichpant-M will help 
shape the program for the county's 200,000 Asian-born residents -- a diverse 
group with 17 distinct populations. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be a real tough challenge," Panichpant-M said. "It's hard to 
find a really relevant -- culturally relevant -- program for Asians whether it 
be in drugs or alcohol or nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
Panichpant-M was also named last week to a state advisory committee on 
addiction and alcoholism within the Asian community. Panichpant-M, who 
maintains her Thai citizenship despite her high-profile job here, said she sees 
a karmic order to her calling as an anti-smoking advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Karma is the Buddhist precept that one's actions determine one's fate, 
Panichpant-M explained. Her maternal grandfather, she says, became a rich man 
in the Golden Triangle but was killed by a shot to the back by business 
associates who double-crossed him. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, a high government official in Thailand, for a time ran the state's 
monopoly on the production and sale of whiskey. He died of esophageal cancer, 
commonly linked to alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"I have learned from the life experiences of my family," Panichpant-M said. 
"There is some truth to that" Buddhist teaching. 
</P>
<P>
She has had a wealth of life experiences herself. 
</P>
<P>
Panichpant-M has spent time in more than 30 countries, traveling extensively as 
a child, and speaks five languages and many more dialects. After postgraduate 
work in health administration at UCLA, she returned to Thailand for a stint as 
a journalist, working for an international business and political affairs 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
She moved back to Southern California in 1980 rather abruptly, she said, 
shortly after predicting a military coup that came to fruition the subsequent 
autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Since then she has returned only for visits. Back in the United States, she met 
her college sweetheart, whom her parents had rejected a decade earlier as 
marriage material. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, both she and her former boyfriend had been married to 
-- and divorced from -- someone else. Neither had children. Now, they are 
married to each other and have one daughter and one son. 
</P>
<P>
Says Panichpant-M: "Yes, there is a certain order to things." ROSE ELLEN
