SILBERMAN MAY HAVE CONFESSED KEY DETAILS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moments after his arrest April 7 in an alleged money-laundering scheme, Richard 
T. Silberman told federal agents that he gave a reputed mobster $6,500 for 
introducing him to a man Silberman believed was connected to Colombian drug 
dealers, according to testimony Monday in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony by an FBI agent, which came during a probation revocation hearing 
for the alleged mobster, Chris Petti, suggests that Silberman, a powerful San 
Diego businessman and political fund-raiser, acknowledged key details about his 
reported involvement and that of Petti and two others in the money-laundering 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U. S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., interviewed after the court 
hearing, was asked if the testimony indicated that Silberman "confessed" to any 
of the charges against him and the others after he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Reasonable Inference 
</P>
<P>
"That's your inference, not mine," Gorder said. But he added, "That's an 
inference a reasonable person would make." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Goodman, a Las Vegas attorney who is representing Petti and is known for 
his outspoken criticism of federal prosecutors, was unusually closemouthed 
after the Monday court session. He refused to comment on whether Silberman may 
have confessed to some of the allegations in the indictment against him and the 
other three defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say anything about it," Goodman said, leaving the courtroom 
and heading straight for the elevators. "And this is big-mouth Goodman saying 
that." 
</P>
<P>
In other court action Monday, James J. Brosnahan, a prominent San Francisco 
attorney, was presented as Silberman's attorney in the money-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan, 55, who was an assistant U. S. attorney in the Kennedy and Johnson 
administrations, most recently surfaced in the public eye in 1986 when he 
joined several others in testifying against the Senate confirmation of William 
H. Rehnquist for chief justice of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and Petti are charged with conspiring to launder $300,000 that they 
allegedly believed came from Colombian drug traffickers. The money actually 
came from an undercover FBI agent posing as a middleman. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged in the complex case are Darryl Nakatsuka of Los Angeles, described 
as a "bag man" in the money-laundering operation, and Jack N. Myers of Malibu, 
who has been associated with Silberman since both raised campaign funds for 
former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
All four defendants have pleaded not guilty, and all but Petti are free on 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing Monday centered on whether Petti, who remains in the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center, has violated the terms of his probation on an earlier 
bookmaking conviction by not reporting to authorities that he received the 
$6,500 from Silberman during the alleged money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
But Goodman said any money Petti may have received from Silberman was later 
given to Robert Benjamin, a longtime associate of Petti's who turned government 
informant to help the FBI in its 2 1/2-year investigation of Petti. That 
investigation later ensnared Silberman and the other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The judge in the probation revocation hearing continued the matter until 
Friday, when Benjamin has been ordered to testify about the alleged transfer of 
money from Silberman to Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Charles B. Walker, a special FBI agent who supervised the Petti-Silberman case, 
described from the witness stand how agents arrested Silberman on April 7 at 
the Hyatt Islandia Hotel while he was purportedly negotiating to launder $1.1 
million in funds the undercover agent had told him were illegal drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Made a Statement' 
</P>
<P>
Walker said Silberman was taken inside Room 719 of the hotel, told why he was 
being arrested, and advised of his Miranda rights. He said Silberman also at 
that time "made a statement." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Silberman told me that he paid Chris Petti approximately $6,500 for having 
introduced him to the special (undercover) agent, whom he knew as Peter 
Carmassi," Walker testified. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me the $6,500 was given to Chris Petti during a meeting at the Denny's 
restaurant. And he told me he did not give money to Mr. Benjamin because he 
told me Mr. Benjamin would be paid by Mr. Carmassi." 
</P>
<P>
On April 3, federal agents had observed a meeting at the downtown Denny's 
between Petti and Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Petti and Mr. Silberman were observed at the counter at the Denny's that 
day," Walker testified in describing the FBI surveillance of that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Silberman was observed giving a package to Mr. Petti, who put it in his 
pocket. It was a small envelope." 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that that is part of the money paid by Silberman to 
Petti as a fee for Petti introducing him to the undercover agent. The 
government alleges that Silberman never knew the true identity of the 
undercover agent and assumed all along that the man was a middleman trying to 
hide money for his Colombia drug-dealing connections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identity Is Revealed 
</P>
<P>
For the first time Monday, the undercover agent revealed his true name when he 
also took the stand and described his role in the government's case. 
</P>
<P>
Peter J. Ahern, an agent from the Newark, N.J., area, said he assumed the name 
Peter Carmassi and presented himself as a man looking for some way to launder 
money for Colombian drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Ahern said he first met Petti in 1988 when he was introduced to him by Benjamin 
at an Escondido restaurant. And he said he later met Silberman after being 
introduced to him by Petti and Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the beginning of many financial deals we were going to do for money he 
was going to launder for me," Ahern said of Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In a Gold Mine' 
</P>
<P>
He said Silberman suggested that he could launder cash "in a gold mine he said 
he owned," which has since been identified as Yuba Natural Resources, north of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Ahern said he held meetings this year with Silberman in which they discussed 
Petti and Benjamin being paid about $12,500 as a fee for introducing them and 
setting in motion the first $100,000 that was to be laundered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrangements for Paying 
</P>
<P>
"He said this was supposed to be for Mr. Petti and Mr. Benjamin," Ahern said. 
"I told Mr. Silberman I would pay Mr. Benjamin because he was working for me, 
and he should pay Mr. Petti and only Mr. Petti, because I was paying Mr. 
Benjamin." 
</P>
<P>
Ahern also said he later asked Petti if Silberman had paid him. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Petti acknowledged he had received money from Mr. Silberman," the agent 
said. "He said he'd been taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Goodman, the agents said Benjamin received $800 from 
Petti that Benjamin said Petti had obtained from Silberman. They said Benjamin 
turned that money over to the FBI so it could be inspected for fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman contended that Petti did not personally benefit from any money from 
Silberman. He said Petti actually turned money from Silberman over to Benjamin, 
and that therefore Petti did not violate his probation because he had no real 
income to report. 
</P>
<P>
He also sharply criticized Benjamin's character, noting that Benjamin has in 
the past been arrested for perjury and eight other criminal felonies. And he 
suggested that Benjamin may not have been willing to turn over all the money to 
the FBI that he received from Petti. 
</P>
<P>
The agents, however, vouched for Benjamin's character. 
</P>
<P>
"I dealt with him, and I trusted him, and that's all that mattered to me," 
Ahern said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman also criticized the prosecution for not presenting Benjamin on the 
witness stand Monday, as the judge had wanted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Benjamin in Court 
</P>
<P>
Gorder, the prosecutor, said he would prepare to have Benjamin in the courtroom 
on Friday, when the hearing continues. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Monday, Marianne Jones, a probation officer, testified that 
Petti has consistently maintained that he is unemployed, has no income and is 
supported by his longtime associate and roommate, Victor Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that Petti has not paid $2,500 in fines in the prior bookmaking 
conviction. And she said he has associated with eight persons involved in 
bookmaking, gambling and other illegal activities, which are further violations 
of his probation.

It's no fish story. William (Salmon Billy) Ellison has a gift and a message for 
President Bush. Ellison, who caught the first salmon of the season in the 
Penobscot River in Maine, plans to continue a tradition of presenting it to the 
President -- along with his own pitch for the environment. Ellison caught the 
6-pound fish shortly after 5:30, just as the sun was rising over the Penobscot 
on the first day of the season. The tradition of delivering the first salmon to 
the White House was begun in 1912 by Maine fisherman Karl Anderson, who caught 
the first Penobscot salmon of that year and presented it to President William 
Howard Taft. The annual ceremony was discontinued during the Dwight D. 
Eisenhower presidency, when the Penobscot had become so polluted that the 
salmon had stopped migrating. The presentations were resumed in 1981 and, this 
year, Ellison "said he plans to say to Bush that he hopes (Bush) will recognize 
the value of the river and continue protecting it," Paul Fournier of the Maine 
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said. Ellison "lives all summer in 
a tent on the riverbank," Fournier said. "He fishes all summer. . . . "

 -- Donald Rice, head of the Santa Monica-based RAND research corporation, has 
been nominated to be secretary of the Air Force, the White House announced. 
Rice, 49, has been president and chief executive officer of RAND since 1972. 
The firm does extensive research and development work for the Air Force. Rice, 
who served in the Army from 1965 to 1967, was deputy assistant secretary of 
defense for resource analysis in 1969 and 1970. He also spent two years as an 
assistant director of the Office of Management and Budget.

 -- Middle school students in Green Bay, Wis., won their battle for free 
expression and rock 'n' roll. Last week, officials at Washington Middle School 
prohibited the wearing of T-shirts bearing the insignia of the heavy-metal 
bands Guns 'N Roses and Black Sabbath. The ban was enacted because of concerns 
raised by parents, Principal J.T. Landes said. About 150 students protested 
that their constitutional right of free speech was being violated, and about 60 
pupils served one-day suspensions Friday for defying the ban. "Just because 
we're little doesn't mean we don't know about the Constitution," said one 
eighth-grader, Kanong Yank, 14. School administrators decided over the weekend 
to lift the ban, provided there is no display of profanities or other 
violations of a dress code established by the Green Bay School Board, Landes 
said. SHIRLEY MARLOW

SABOTAGE IS SUSPECTED IN ORANGE GLEN CAP SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seniors at Escondido's Orange Glen High School are suspected of "flunking" 
state academic assessment tests on purpose to express their anger at having 
off-campus lunch privileges suspended. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th-grade scores dropped precipitously in December tests, a few weeks 
after the school instituted a locked parking lot policy. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Ed Brand said Monday that he planned to get to the bottom of the 
so-called sabotage, which, according to several teachers and students, was 
common knowledge on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Brand said he has asked the state Department of Education to send him 
individual scores to determine if students purposely marked incorrect answers 
on the multiple-choice test. The test is designed to assess the effectiveness 
of the school's teaching program, not a student's individual achievement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Pattern? 
</P>
<P>
Students reported that some of the seniors had "decorated" their answer sheets 
with Christmas tree designs using random answer spaces as the outline. Others 
allegedly marked their answers using A, C and D answer spaces to spell out 
AC/DC, a popular heavy-metal band. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no proof of any of this," Brand said, "but the state (Department of 
Education) has promised me the information we need within a week to 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't plan punishment for students found to have participated in 
the antic, but would work to assure "that a thing like this does not happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Scores on the California Assessment Program (CAP) test dropped Orange Glen to 
below the state average in reading and math. In 1987, the high school won a 
National Secondary School Recognition Award. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen administrators angered the seniors last October by ordering the 
gates to the campus parking lot locked during school hours, maintaining that 
the measure would cut down on the vandalism that had plagued the parking area 
last year and at the beginning of the school year in September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Down on Vandalism 
</P>
<P>
Brand said the locked gates have cut vandalism but admitted that seniors view 
the action as restricting their rights. Although most students are not allowed 
to leave campus during school hours, seniors with satisfactory academic records 
and parental consent had been allowed off campus during lunch breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was sabotage, pure and simple," one Orange Glen instructor said. 
"The scores reflect directly against the school, its teachers and its 
administrators. The students were angry and they showed their anger." 
</P>
<P>
Escondido High School, where reading scores dropped but math scores improved, 
does not suspect a similar revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Nichols, Escondido High principal, said that "it's not very likely that 
our seniors skewed just one part of the CAP tests and not the rest." Escondido 
High students don't have a locked parking area, she said, but students are 
"monitored" to make sure there are no unauthorized comings and goings during 
the school day. 
</P>
<P>
Similar sabotage of the CAP test is suspected at West High School in Torrance, 
where school officials said students apparently were "sending a message" to 
administrators that the school places too much emphasis on the examination. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen has been rocked by a number of tragic incidents during the school 
year, including an arson, two student suicides and the arrest of three students 
and a teacher's aide in connection with the slaying of the aide's estranged 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Can't Get Much Worse' 
</P>
<P>
"Things can't get much worse," Brand said. "We must turn things around." 
</P>
<P>
A state accreditation team was visiting the Escondido school campus when the 
suspected CAP test scandal became public. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Fong, research analyst with the state Department of Education, said he has 
received Brand's request for a review of the CAP tests but admitted that it 
would not be easy to unmask the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
The state has the raw data from the school CAP tests, he said, but it does not 
include student names. If the school can trace the test-taker from his or her 
birth date and other identifying data, "then I guess they can figure out who 
should have done well but didn't," Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, Fong said, "we could send for the actual test books, which 
are kept by the test firm (Data Recognition Corp.) in Minnesota," to check if 
there were actual Christmas tree designs or AC/DC answer patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Even that proof would not change the school's ranking, Brand said. "We live or 
die by what those students did in December."

LAURENCE PRICE TESTIFIES OF SNUB BY MULTIMILLIONAIRE FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laurence Price, son of multimillionaire businessman Sol Price, told a Superior 
Court jury Monday that he felt ignored by his father and that he was 
particularly hurt when his father refused to attend a party after his son's bar 
mitzvah. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Laurence Price said. "I cried for hours and hours, 
and, when the rabbi came over, I cried on his shoulder, in the bedroom. It was 
the most emotionally high day and emotionally low day. I don't want to ever 
have to go through that again." 
</P>
<P>
Price, 43, is suing his father for $100 million for emotional distress he 
claims his father caused by interfering with the raising of Laurence's sons, 
Jonas, 17, and Benjamin, 15. He is represented by Los Angeles attorney Marvin 
Mitchelson. 
</P>
<P>
He said he still suffers from the bar mitzvah incident, which occurred in 
January, 1985. He said his father attended the ceremony at a temple in the Del 
Cerro neighborhood, but refused to attend the party at Laurence's home 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It still affects me today," he said. "I don't know how you take it back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Serious Rift 
</P>
<P>
Laurence said his father also interfered by helping to buy Jonas a car without 
consulting him and by taking Jonas on a trip to view the campus of Stanford 
University without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Although Laurence and Sol Price were at odds periodically for decades, the most 
serious rift occurred about three weeks before the bar mitzvah episode, 
according to Laurence's testimony. About 11:30 one night in December, 1984, 
Laurence's sons, who were living with their mother, telephoned him and begged 
him to come and get them, he said. He went over to pick them up and took them 
to his house. 
</P>
<P>
He described them as "distraught," but added that he was never able to 
determine why they were so upset. Laurence and his wife, Emma, were divorced 
and she had been awarded physical custody of the boys, although they had joint 
legal custody, which meant that he had a say in major decisions about their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
About a week later, Laurence said, he got a telephone call from his father, who 
said, "Larry, take those boys back to their mother or I'm going to take away 
your business and disinherit you." 
</P>
<P>
Laurence told the jury he was "enraged" and called his father back later to 
tell him "never to threaten me again." 
</P>
<P>
To give in, he said, "would be like abandoning my children. I felt I was 
abandoned by my father. If I had to lose everything, I would lose everything." 
The younger boy still lives with Laurence, but the older one is living with his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Sol and Laurence have spoken only once since then, he said, although on 
cross-examination by Sol Price's lawyer, Gerald McMahon, Laurence conceded 
that, about six months later his father forgave him a $20,000 loan and 
continued to give gifts to the children. 
</P>
<P>
About eight months later, Laurence Price lost his lease to operate a tire 
installation business at his father's Price Club discount warehouses. Sol Price 
had set Laurence up in the business in 1978 after Laurence had been out of work 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Particularly Galling 
</P>
<P>
Laurence quit a job at the Price Club in 1976 in part because he thought the 
$23,000 salary he was making was too low contrasted with that of a cousin, who 
was making $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly galling, however, was the attitude of his older brother, Robert, 
who was paid $40,000 a year as president of the Price Club, Laurence said. 
"Robert had very little patience with me," Laurence said, adding that his 
brother sometimes ordered him out of his (Robert's) office after meetings by 
saying, "That's it. Get out." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe anyone has the right to do that to anyone else," Laurence 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The final straw, he said, was when Robert ordered him to get a hanger for his 
coat and a trash can for his office, Laurence said. "Nobody needs this kind of 
trouble," Laurence said. "It was just two frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
For the next two years, he said, he looked for business opportunities and was 
supported by his father until his father came up with the tire installation 
idea, he said.

It wasn't a very high hill the veterans were trying to take, not at all 
comparable to the steep mountains they fought over at Chosen Reservoir 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
This was instead a sun-drenched knoll overlooking the Pacific in an area of San 
Pedro whose serenity blends with a view of sky and ocean to form an almost 
perfect landscape of peace. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans took the knoll on a day filled with joy and vowed to erect on its 
slopes a monument to those who won the high ground in Korea under far less 
tranquil conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But what a communist enemy couldn't do to these aging warriors without blood 
flowing like ribbons in the snow was accomplished last week by a civic 
committee in a meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans were swept off the knoll without a shot being fired, and we all 
ought to be a little disturbed by the offhanded manner of their dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
They had been attempting to win approval for a war memorial down the hill from 
the Korean Friendship Bell at Angel's Gate Park on land offered by Mayor Tom 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition emerged from those who didn't want a memorial to war near a 
friendship bell or who didn't want a monument bristling with guns, and this one 
does. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Cultural Affairs Commission agreed with the dissidents and in effect 
told the veterans to get another site, get another statue or just get lost. The 
tone of rejection bordered on humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
What appeared certain had suddenly become uncertain, and the monument went down 
with a bullet in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to be a routine appearance," Jack Stites said later. He's 
executive director of the International Korean War Memorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We went into that meeting thinking it involved only a preliminary review of 
monument design and location. But the minute I walked in I smelled an ambush, 
and I was right." 
</P>
<P>
I fought in the Korean War and have strong feelings about friends who died 
there, their lives ended in a twinkling of the time it took to be born. The 
Cultural Commission's dismissal of the veterans defiles their memory and 
rankles me to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
But, even so, I am uneasy about another monument to men at arms. 
</P>
<P>
The dichotomy derives from the fact that statues pay homage to war's grandeur, 
not its horror, and the ethos of violence has already damaged us enough. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Karl is another Korean War veteran who objects not to a monument but to 
a monument that glorifies guns. He resigned as president of the community's 
Friendship Bell Committee because its members wanted no memorial at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe what we did in Korea was right," Karl said, "but that statue is an 
abomination. Why not an eternal flame or a tile walkway bearing all the names 
of those who died? There has to be something else, something without guns." 
</P>
<P>
"Unrealistic," snapped Lawrence Fitzgerald. "How in the hell can you raise a 
memorial to war without showing guns?" 
</P>
<P>
He stood on cane-like half-crutches in the middle of his San Pedro home, a 
warrior crippled by time and history. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we let down the 5,000 people who have supported us so far?" he 
demanded. "How can we abandon 42,000 Americans who died in battle for their 
country?" 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald is chairman of a citizens committee supporting the memorial. He's 
also a veteran of America's last three wars, a holder of two Purple Hearts and 
a man who lives night and day with a legacy of war's explosions that have left 
a ringing in his ears so intense that he sleeps little and hears less. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no war lover," he said to me. "You think I like hopping around on these 
damned pogo sticks? Half my life has been wasted. But, by God, we've got to 
remind people of the agony those men suffered." 
</P>
<P>
"We won't stop trying," Stites said. "You've heard the phrase, 'Retreat, hell'? 
This isn't over." 
</P>
<P>
Men like Fitzgerald and Stites don't give up easily. They'll go up that sunny 
hill again if the devil himself waits at the top. 
</P>
<P>
I won't be with them. 
</P>
<P>
A long time ago we abandoned the practice of carrying the heads of enemies 
around on sticks to glorify the exploits of battle. The day has come to stop 
glorifying those exploits in bronze. 
</P>
<P>
I resent the manner in which the Cultural Affairs Commission trod on the 
sensitivities of those who want a memorial, but Richard Karl was right. An 
eternal flame is better than eternal guns. 
</P>
<P>
The days of drums and bugles belong to the past.

In spite of all the news coverage of the Wright affair, there is one important 
aspect which has been mostly overlooked. The Ethics Committee has been absorbed 
in the investigation for the better part of a year and the evidence considered 
has been voluminous. The committee membership is divided evenly between 
opposite political philosophies. The subject of the investigation is not only 
the man third in line to the presidency, not only a congressional colleague, 
but he is the one who makes committee assignments! In essence he is the boss of 
the panel members. 
</P>
<P>
Yet after all these months the committee has been able to bring in a unanimous 
consensus on 69 counts. That is a monumental tribute to the skill of the 
chairman of the committee, Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles). Walking that 
tightrope for so many weeks demonstrates a rare ability to maintain balance. 
Although a "reason to believe" is not to be confused with a conviction, and 
many more days of hearings and deliberations are yet to come, I think the 
country feels better knowing that the leadership of the committee will be in 
the capable hands of Dixon. We in Los Angeles -- indeed in California -- are 
justifiably proud to count Julian Dixon as one of our own.

Your editorial calling for Wright to resign puzzles me. The charges presented 
so far are, by admission of the Ethics Committee, based on suspicion, not hard 
evidence. If the evidence is produced, then he should resign. 
</P>
<P>
What puzzles me is that there is now emerging from the North trial (evidence) 
that both Ronald Reagan and George Bush were involved in the illegal activities 
and were impeachable. The information emerging is far more credible at this 
point than the charges against Wright. So why aren't you calling for Bush to 
resign? Is it hypocrisy?

VENTURA FREEWAY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Becoming 41 years old was trauma enough, but then the Ventura Freeway 
construction project began! Since I live in Agoura Hills and work in the San 
Fernando Valley, this project scared me. I could see myself in bumper-to-bumper 
traffic day in and day out. I began securing supplies for the ordeal: fresh 
drinking water, crackers, stress reduction tapes, and a new pair of sunglasses. 
I convinced myself that being away from my family that much longer would make 
them appreciate me even more. 
</P>
<P>
Well, to my astonished delight I am thoroughly enjoying being 41 and the 
Ventura Freeway project has been a well-executed and obviously well-planned 
endeavor, so far. The complexities of the project are apparent as I weave my 
way from one side of the freeway to the other and detour to previously less 
traveled roadways under the watchful eye of the Highway Patrol and traffic 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
The most amazing thing of all is that I am actually making better time now than 
before the project . . . so much for absence making the heart grow fonder.

'GEORGIA FOR GEORGIANS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Ronald Grigor Suny's column "Georgia for Georgians Is Suddenly 
Not So Soviet," Op-Ed Page, April 17: 
</P>
<P>
Suny states that Georgians did not experience the "Russification" like the 
Ukrainian, Belorussian or Baltic republics. As far as the Ukrainians are 
concerned, it's rather difficult to throw off the Russian yoke when over 7 
million of its population was starved to death as result of a man-made famine 
instituted by the powers-that-be in Moscow in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, Russians have attempted to destroy Ukrainians. To rob them of 
their historic heritage, Russians managed to see to that that fires "of unknown 
origin" destroyed archives in museums and libraries. In spite of this 
continuous Russification, the Ukrainians still fought back. This is the reason 
that the most common language heard in the slave labor camps is Ukrainian. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian populace was not treated as harshly. One reason may be that 
Georgian natural resources are not as valuable as the ones in the Ukraine and 
the Georgian area is more remote geographically. The Ukraine and Belorussia are 
the two most critical republics within the Soviet Union. The food crops which 
feed Russia are grown almost exclusively in these two republics. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, I applaud the brave people of the Georgian Republic in their 
relentless pursuit of their much-deserved freedom from Moscow.

WHERE'S THE PASSION NOW FOR IRAN-CONTRA REFORMS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN E. GOODMAN, Allan E. Goodman, associate dean of the School of Foreign 
Service at Georgetown University, is co-author with Bruce Berkowitz of 
Strategic Intelligence for American National Security (Princeton University 
Press, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time the American public was told that the Iran-Contra affair was 
an aberration. "Never again," was the assurance by the President, the 
independent review board chaired by former Sen. John Tower and the joint 
congressional committee investigating the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
There were some of us who disagreed with this finding and believed that strong 
action was required to regulate and oversee the use of covert action and secret 
diplomacy. However, as public concern about the scandal waned -- Ronald Reagan 
was fond of saying that it didn't matter at all to the folks living beyond the 
Washington Beltway -- the pressure for reform lost much of its momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The most far-reaching and significant reform was the proposed amendment to the 
National Security Act requiring that the congressional intelligence oversight 
committees be given prior notice of virtually all covert actions. In 
fast-breaking and rare circumstances in which the President determines that 
Congress cannot be informed in advance, the change in the law would require 
that Congress be notified no later than 48 hours after an operation had been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
Vigorously opposed by the CIA, these requirements would have assured that 
Congress received the timely notice of planned covert action operations that 
was missing in the Iran-Contra affair. After passing the Senate by a vote of 
71-19 in March, 1988, and being favorably reported out of the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence in June, the amendment was taken off the 
calendar for a vote in the House in September and -- as a gesture of 
bipartisanship by the leadership of the House -- shelved when Congress 
reconvened in January 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Jim Wright's reasons for doing so were political. He apparently thought 
that he lacked the votes to pass the amendment over a presidential veto and 
that his own alleged breach of security in discussing U.S. covert actions in 
Central America at a press conference last in September had weakened the 
argument that Congress could be trusted to keep secrets. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever motivated the Speaker's decision, the fact remains that under 
present laws and executive orders, Congress still has no way to make sure that 
it is kept fully and currently informed of covert action plans. 
</P>
<P>
Another cause of the Iran-Contra affair was the tendency of the President's 
assistant for national security affairs and the assistants to that official 
(i.e., the NSC staff) to implement and manage policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Tower Commission recommended that these tendencies should be vigorously 
resisted. But the commission also recommended that the national security 
adviser, and not the secretaries of state or defense, should chair the 
top-level interdepartment committees that formulate and decide national 
security policy. President Bush's national security adviser, Gen. Brent 
Scowcroft, was a member of the Tower Commission and has done precisely what was 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the line between chairing such committees and advocating 
policy is easy to breach. Moreover, such advocacy often leads to a desire to at 
least manage, if not implement, the course of action selected. 
</P>
<P>
By putting the national security adviser in charge of the meeting, President 
Bush virtually invites Scowcroft to take over when the inevitable disputes 
between the secretaries of state and defense threaten to stymie U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it can be argued that any system for making decisions in any 
organization can be flawed if the people who participate in it lack integrity. 
The principal finding of both the Tower Commission and the joint congressional 
committee was that the Iran-Contra affair resulted from the failure of 
individuals to observe the law. 
</P>
<P>
True, Oliver L. North is awaiting a jury's verdict, and former National 
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter is soon to go to trial. But the government 
has had to drop the most serious charges against North due to the fear that to 
prove its case, sensitive national security information might have to be 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
The government also opposed the right of North's defense attorneys to require 
former President Reagan to testify. Consequently, the public will never really 
know if North was acting alone and without the approval of higher authority. So 
even if North is found guilty of the charges against him, he will be seen by 
many as a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it is highly questionable that the North trial will act as a deterrent to 
gung-ho officials in the future bent on using covert action as an alternative 
means of conducting U.S. foreign policy.

ARMS-CONTROL INTEGRITY ON THE LINE; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. ACTIONS ON THRESHOLD TREATY COST US THE MORAL GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIDNEY D. DRELL and WOLFGANG K.H. PANOFSKY, Sidney D. Drell is deputy 
director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky is 
director emeritus. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union signed the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in 
1974, but no American President has ever submitted the treaty, which restricts 
underground nuclear explosions to a yield below 150 kilotons, to the Senate for 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
This record has raised doubts about the U.S. role, and even motives, as a 
negotiating partner in arms control. It stands in sharp contrast to recent 
Soviet flexibility and initiatives, and we face a challenge to action if we are 
not to lose to them the moral high ground in arms control. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration now has an opportunity to review the reasons for 
procrastination given by its predecessors. The ostensible reason for 
non-ratification given repeatedly by the Ronald Reagan Administration was that 
we could not measure the treaty's 150-kiloton threshold very accurately -- thus 
constituting an unacceptable risk. 
</P>
<P>
But this makes no sense. When President Richard M. Nixon signed the treaty, 
seismologists had concluded that the 150-kiloton threshold could be measured by 
existing U.S. instruments outside the Soviet Union to "within a factor of two." 
This means that if the Soviets attempted to cheat by releasing nuclear blasts 
at 300 kilotons, the United States would detect a violation 95% of the time. 
They might get away with cheating by a much smaller amount, but not one of 
military or technical significance to either the United States or the Soviet 
Union. (The 150-kiloton limit, observed by both countries despite the lack of 
ratification, was established to satisfy the weapons designers; explosions can 
be detected and identified at yields 10 to 20 times smaller.) 
</P>
<P>
Thus Nixon agreed that verification technology in 1974 was adequate to remove 
any risk to U.S. security from Soviet cheating. Since 1974, seismologists have 
improved their instruments and methods of analysis. The "factor of two" 
uncertainty of 1974 has been reduced to less than a factor of 1.5. Even so, the 
Reagan Administration insisted that this was not good enough, and that further, 
more intrusive observations were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the Soviets gave in and agreed to talks on improving verification. 
Initially the Soviets wanted to talk both about laying the technical groundwork 
for reducing the allowed yields below the 150-kiloton threshold and about more 
precise measurements of the treaty's limit. We insisted on talking only about 
use of the so-called CORRTEX method of verification, proposing it as a "direct" 
yield measurement. The Soviets maintained that CORRTEX, which measures the 
yield of an explosion by determining the speed at which the shock arrives at a 
nearby test hole, was no better than the less-intrusive seismic observation, 
but gave in by agreeing to the joint verification experiments to be carried 
out, using both the seismic and CORRTEX methods, in Siberia and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
These tests have now been concluded, in itself a remarkable exhibition of the 
new cooperation between Washington and Moscow. But now, according to published 
reports, the United States is refusing to release the data obtained from the 
joint tests even though the Soviets have proposed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
This sequence paints an embarrassing picture of American conduct: 
</P>
<P>
 -- We are refusing, giving patently invalid and contrived reasons, to ratify a 
treaty signed by a U.S. President 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We are refusing technical information to the American people that we are 
sharing with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We seem to find it difficult to accept "yes" for an answer when negotiating 
with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '70s, the situation was reversed. The Soviets were intransigent 
negotiators, obsessed with secrecy. Now, in the view of many world observers, 
particularly in Europe, the United States is in the role of the heavy in the 
arms-control process. 
</P>
<P>
Why is all this occurring? Do the results of the joint experiments contradict 
the U.S. positions? Could the data show that indeed, CORRTEX is not enough more 
precise than more-remote seismic measurements to warrant its greatly increased 
intrusiveness? Do some of the signals from U.S. explosions exceed the allowed 
limit by a small amount in the same way as some Soviet tests led President 
Reagan to charge that they were "likely to have violated the treaty?" 
</P>
<P>
The issue we are discussing here is not whether or when the permitted 
explosions should be lowered in size or stopped altogether. The issue is the 
integrity of the United States as a negotiating partner in arms control and the 
responsibility of the U.S. government to inform its own citizens on technical 
facts we are sharing with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gaffney, Reagan's deputy assistant secretary of defense, has written: 
"The more time wasted on discussions and experimentation of (yield) monitoring 
techniques irrelevant to . . . complete prohibition of legal nuclear tests, the 
easier it will be to stave off demands for the more constraining comprehensive 
test ban." Does the Bush Administration wish to continue the pursuit of arms 
control in this spirit? 
</P>
<P>
We suggest that the President immediately release the data on the 
Nevada-Siberia experiments, whether they do or do not support past positions; 
submit the Threshold Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for consent to ratification, 
and continue the joint verification experiments to calibrate the seismic 
methods with CORRTEX, looking forward to measurements oflower-yield explosions. 
</P>
<P>
These steps will recapture some of the moral ground in arms control that have 
been lost to the Soviets in view of the unfortunate record of the Threshold 
Test Ban Treaty cited here.

DEAF JURORS WIN 8-YEAR BATTLE FOR INTERPRETERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County broke a sound barrier Monday that will enable deaf and 
hearing-impaired citizens to serve on juries in municipal and superior courts. 
</P>
<P>
"At least deaf people now have the option of serving on a jury just like 
everybody else," said Nathan Shapiro, 57, a prospective Van Nuys Superior Court 
juror who on Monday became the first person with hearing problems to be 
assigned a sign-language interpreter at county expense. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro and the Greater Los Angeles Council for the Deaf began fighting for 
interpreters for jurors nearly a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, people with hearing problems were excused from jury duty. With the 
addition of the new interpreter program, hearing problems will no longer be 
reason enough not to serve, said Ed Johnson, director of interpreter services 
for the county's courts. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this will encourage other deaf and hearing-impaired people to become 
jurors," Johnson said. "We now have seven others in our jury pool waiting to be 
assigned to a court." 
</P>
<P>
The new service will cost the county $30,000 for a full-time coordinator plus 
$171 a day for each interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Interpreters will be available in municipal and superior courts in Van Nuys, 
Torrance, downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Pasadena, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The service is the result of a settlement reached last October in a federal 
class action lawsuit filed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Council for the Deaf filed the suit after Shapiro, a Northridge engineer 
who has had hearing difficulties since birth, hired an interpreter in 1980 to 
help him serve as a juror in San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro billed the county about $4,000 for the interpreter's fee. But the 
county refused to pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Pay 
</P>
<P>
When Shapiro was summoned for jury duty in 1987, county officials again refused 
to pay for an interpreter, which led the Council for the Deaf to press even 
harder for settlement of the lawsuit, said Marcella Meyer, council executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time that deaf people had the right to serve as jurors if they want 
to," Meyer said. "This is one step forward." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long overdue," said Karen Bowman, 29, of Northridge, who was hired 
earlier this year to coordinate the sign language service. "There are many, 
many people who could serve as well as hearing people." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, who has been deaf since birth, read the standard jury orientation for 
Shapiro in sign language Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Benita Maupin, an interpreter with the county courts, will provide 
sign-language interpretation if Shapiro is selected as a juror. 
</P>
<P>
Maupin, who can hear, said she learned sign language before she learned to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Both my parents were deaf," Maupin said. "So you could say English is my 
second language. Sign language is my first." 
</P>
<P>
Maupin said the courts traditionally have provided interpreters for deaf or 
hearing-impaired witnesses and defendants, but not for jurors. 
</P>
<P>
When other deaf or hearing- impaired people learn of the new service, Maupin 
said, she believes many will want to serve on a jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Isn't Called 
</P>
<P>
As for Shapiro, he failed to be called for a jury panel on his first day of 
duty but said he hopes to serve on a case. He said it doesn't matter whether 
the trial is civil or criminal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important process," Shapiro said of the American jury system. 
"That's why I've put so much into it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes many other hearing-impaired jurors will follow him. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I'm not the last one called," he said.

TAFT STUDENTS HOPE TEAM'S VICTORY WILL RUB OFF ON THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Students at Taft High School prepared Monday for a string of celebrations to 
revel in the school's victory in the U.S. Academic Decathlon, overjoyed not 
only for their brainy classmates, but because they expect the honor to rub off 
on them in the competition to get into college. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to help when we apply to colleges," said junior Elisa Miller, who 
holds the student government office of director of school spirit. She plans to 
apply to fashion merchandising programs at the University of Arizona and 
Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll say, 'She was part of Taft High School.' They'll know now where I go 
to school." 
</P>
<P>
"It will really prove to colleges that when you earn a grade at Taft, it's 
really a grade. There are no easy A's here," student body President Josh 
Stenger said as he rearranged the red letters on the school marquee at the 
corner of Ventura Boulevard and Winnetka Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Message 
</P>
<P>
The messages touting a blood drive and Cinco De Mayo celebration gave way to: 
</P>
<P>
"CONGRATULATIONS DECATHLON NATIONAL CHAMPIONS." 
</P>
<P>
Students whooped, hollered "Alllll Riiiight" and clapped when, just after the 
lunch bell, Assistant Principal Patricia White announced over the public 
address system that Taft had defeated 38 other schools to win the decathlon in 
Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
White had waited all morning for a long-distance call from Principal Ronald 
Berz, who accompanied the team. "I just had the feeling we were going to win 
this year," she said, and after Taft won the nationally televised Super Quiz on 
Saturday, the contest's final event, "it made that feeling stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Stenger, a friend of many of the decathlon members, said the victory was a 
relief because "they wanted it so much." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to hearing their tales of success," Stenger said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Rounded Students 
</P>
<P>
"They're much more socially well-rounded than people think," he said of the 
team members, noting that they include a varsity basketball player, drama 
student and student government leader. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just call them nerds, because they aren't. They all have other 
things to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Chris Allen was staffing the switchboard, which buzzed with calls from 
parents and reporters. Allen, who transferred to Taft this year from a Granada 
Hills school, said: "It's kind of cool to come to a school where they're into 
studying that much. 
</P>
<P>
"People are really into their work. . . . It's easier to learn here." 
</P>
<P>
The band, drill team, cheerleaders, student government leaders and selected 
students will take two buses to LAX today to greet the champions when they step 
off American Airlines Flight 275 at 4:54 p.m. "We want to let them know how 
proud we are of them -- we appreciate the hard work they put in," said Stenger, 
who hopes the school will hold a banquet for the team members and their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airport Welcome 
</P>
<P>
Among the airport greeters will be seniors Jesus Abellaneda and Maribel Aragon, 
who ride a bus a half an hour every morning from outside the Valley to get to 
Taft. They do not know any of the decathlon members but accepted White's 
invitation to go to LAX, because, Aragon said, "we're proud of our school." 
</P>
<P>
"It goes to show we're the smartest school," Abellaneda said. "We can tell our 
kids that we went to that famous school that won the decathlon." 
</P>
<P>
A rally is planned for Friday, White said. She said that Mayor Tom Bradley 
called to say he would visit the school this week to congratulate the team. 
</P>
<P>
Several underclassmen were not as enthusiastic about the news. They did not 
know the team members and, being further from college applications, did not 
feel a personal stake in the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Others were not surprised because, they said, Taft has always been strong in 
academics and because it came in second in the decathlon last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Surprise 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised because they wanted it badly enough to win it," said 
English teacher Nina Pashley, who has taught several of the team members in her 
11th-grade honors class in American literature and composition. The team's 
coach, Arthur Berchin, "goes for breadth and depth" and the students "are 
committed and have good rapport with the coach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping for it, but also expecting it." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Seyong Cho said her parents -- who read about the team in a bilingual 
Korean-English newspaper last year -- will probably be more thrilled than she 
is. "They were really excited and said, 'Oh, I wish you were on the decathlon 
team.' " 
</P>
<P>
She was more blase. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always been number one. We're used to it," she said. "If we came in 
fourth or fifth, then we would talk about it."

The San Diego City Council voted Monday to have the city manager's office draft 
an ordinance that would impose so-called regional impact fees on developers. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the fees is to have developers -- both residential and 
commercial -- pay extra taxes when they build something that would have an 
impact on the entire city or a large part of it. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing is set for June 20.

<P>
A 17-year-old boy suspected of being the triggerman in two slayings in North 
County that authorities believe may have been racially motivated pleaded not 
guilty Monday at his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a gray sweat shirt and jeans, Kenneth Alexander Kovzelove appeared 
before San Diego Municipal Judge Lillian Quon, in his first court appearance 
since last week's ruling that he was fit to be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Quon ordered Kovzelove kept in County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail, as 
requested by Deputy Dist. Atty. Dave Stutz. 
</P>
<P>
Kovzelove of San Diego and 19-year-old Dennis Bencivenga of Rancho Bernardo are 
accused of killing Hilario Salgado, 22, and Matilde de la Sancha, 19, on an 
isolated stretch of Black Mountain Road on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Their preliminary hearing was rescheduled from Monday until May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga was arrested in March and arraigned then, but Kovzelove had to be 
extradited from Fort Benning, Ga., where he was in training as an Army 
paratrooper. 
</P>
<P>
Kovzelove's case was handled in Juvenile Court until Thursday, when Judge Larry 
Kapiloff found that he should be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga, who allegedly drove the pickup truck from which Kovzelove is 
believed to have gunned down the two men with an assault rifle, has posted 
$150,000 bail, and remains free.

LANCASTER CITY COUNCIL ELECTS HARRISON AS MAYOR IN 4-1 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster City Councilwoman Lynn Harrison was elected mayor by a 4-1 vote of 
the council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman George Theophanis cast the lone vote against Harrison, saying she 
would not be able "to pull the council together." Theophanis said he opposed 
Harrison because she and other council members had taken part in closed 
discussions, which Theophanis alleged violated the state law that requires open 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison denied the charge. She said that Theophanis had objected to a closed 
discussion the council held at its April 17 meeting, but that the city attorney 
had attended the session and ruled it legal. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison took over the mayor's post from Councilman Els Groves, whom the 
council elected unanimously last July after the sudden death of former Mayor 
Nicholas J. Maluccio. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Arnie Rodio and Bill Pursley joined Groves in voting for Harrison 
Monday. They said Harrison, whose council term expires next year, would be an 
excellent mayor.

DELEON ZEROS IN ON PADRES; 
</P>
<P>
ST. LOUIS WINS SIXTH CONSECUTIVE GAME WITH 6-0 DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the reasons Jack McKeon pried Jack Clark away from the Yankees last 
October was for Clark's leadership abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, on the opening night of a seven-game home stand, the Padres played 
follow the leader. Problem was, Clark led by swinging -- and missing. 
</P>
<P>
And the rest of the Padres didn't do much better, as their 6-0 whitewashing at 
the hands of St. Louis and Jose DeLeon indicates. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has now faced DeLeon 11 times in his career. He has struck out seven 
times. That counts Clark's plate appearance in the second inning Monday, when 
he swung and missed at strike three. And it counts his appearance in the 
fourth, when he stood and looked at strike three. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kind of found himself -- he's one of the few pitchers besides Nolan Ryan 
that every time he pitches, he's capable of throwing a no-hitter," Clark said. 
"I would compare him to Mike Scott. He's that good." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's teammates didn't do much better. Although the Padres got at least one 
hit in five of the first seven innings, none of the hits came when they were 
most needed. Four double plays erased any threat of a rally and did nothing to 
please a San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium crowd of 31,393 anxious to welcome the 
club home from its 8-5 trip. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, DeLeon was best known for fashioning a 2-19 record in Pittsburgh in 
1985. But his fastball has been balancing nicely with his breaking ball lately, 
the defense behind him has been good, and DeLeon has turned things around. 
</P>
<P>
That's why, entering Monday's game, he led National League pitchers in 
opponents' batting average (.141) and was tied for the league lead in victories 
(4-1). And that wasn't all. He was tied for fifth in the league in earned run 
average (1.96) and tied for second in innings pitched (41 1/3). 
</P>
<P>
And what Padre game would be complete without an error? Three more were 
committed Monday. Although only the second one, John Kruk's misplay of Tony 
Pena's bases-loaded single, led to any of the Cardinals' half-dozen runs, they 
did increase San Diego's season total to 33. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Padres had gotten a few more hits, and even if they had committed 
fewer errors, starter Bruce Hurst's night wouldn't have been easy. The 
Cardinals arrived in town ranked second in the league in three major categories 
-- batting (.268), pitching (3.07 earned-run average), and fielding (.986%). 
</P>
<P>
So it wasn't long, then, before they were on their way to their sixth 
consecutive victory. Hurst (3-2) held them in check for two innings, allowed a 
run in the third, and then was bombed for five runs on six hits in the sixth. 
His evening finished after the seventh inning, after six runs (all earned), 10 
hits, a walk and three strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't very focused," Hurst said. "I was working hard and fast. I have a 
tendency to get going too quickly. I need to back off, slow down and let them 
think about it for a while. When I work too fast, I get elevated in the strike 
zone. And that's when I get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly wasn't the Bruce Hurst who had won his last three decisions. But 
Hurst was driven from the mound by some slap-happy Cardinal hitters -- of the 
10 hits Hurst allowed, nine were singles. Only Vince Coleman's seventh-inning 
double to right went for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a pesky bunch," McKeon said. "They're good two-strike hitters. They 
put the ball in play. You saw the results in that five-run inning." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals did all the things the Padres didn't in terms of putting the ball 
in play. San Diego's best chance to score came in the fifth, when the Padres 
loaded the bases with the score, 1-0, and only one out. The threat ended 
quickly when Roberto Alomar hit a hard grounder to short, which Ozzie Smith 
gobbled up to start an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope some of our guys were watching those guys," McKeon said. "That's what 
I'm talking about. They just put the ball in play." 
</P>
<P>
That was something the Padres had trouble doing against DeLeon, who struck out 
eight and allowed just six hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he could pitch, but I didn't know he was that tough," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Said St. Louis Manager Whitey Herzog: "George Brett told me he would rather 
face anybody but DeLeon." 
</P>
<P>
It was a game that Padre fans should have been able to recognize early on. The 
first error arrived early -- in the first inning. With two out, Terry Pendleton 
grounded to Tim Flannery, who fielded the ball cleanly and then launched a 
rainbow to first. Clark didn't even bother jumping. He just watched the ball 
arc over his head. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton reached second on the error, bringing Pedro Guerrero (.275, three 
home runs) to the plate. But Guerrero didn't even get to swing the bat. On a 
one-ball count, Pendleton took off for third. Santiago snapped a throw to 
Flannery to get Pendleton and keep the game scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
Flannery redeemed himself in the third. St. Louis was ahead, 1-0, and Coleman 
was on first when Flannery made a diving stop on a Smith ground ball, got up 
and threw him out at first. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals increased their 1-0 lead when Tom Brunansky, an old Hurst nemesis 
from their American League days, batted in the sixth. Brunansky, who entered 
the game with a lifetime .577 (15 for 26) batting average against Hurst, 
singled to center to score Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Hurst, it was just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Injured outfielder Shane Mack met with Manager Jack McKeon before Monday's game 
to discuss his return. According to Mack, he told McKeon he could return in two 
or three days. If that's the case, look for him to be optioned to triple-A Las 
Vegas. Mack, who has been out since spring training with bone chips in his 
right elbow, joined the Padres on their just-completed trip to take extra 
batting practice. He took his second cortisone shot April 15 and started 
hitting in Atlanta on April 21. Mack said there is no pain when he swings, but 
he's still working on getting full extension on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Andy Benes' 4-0 record and 0.44 earned-run average in five starts at 
Wichita (double-A), don't look for the Padres to rush him up to Las Vegas. 
"He's put up some good numbers, but there are other reasons why he's still in 
Wichita," Padre Director of Player Development Tom Romenesko said. "The 
development process is much more than just numbers. There are all kinds of 
things. One is his age -- he won't be 22 until August. And he's only pitched 
five times against three different teams. He's adapting very well, don't get me 
wrong, but to say one day we'll turn on the lights and Superman will appear is 
ridiculous." The Padres also want Benes to have a chance to get settled, 
because the last year has been hectic for him. He went from college (the 
University of Evansville) to the U.S. Olympic team to the Padre minicamp this 
winter. Also, his wife has had a baby in the last year.

MORNING BRIEFING: IF NOTHING ELSE, THEY'LL LOOK AS IF THEY'RE A TOUGH TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kansas State football, among the worst that has played at the Division I level, 
is retooling the best way it can, for now. It's redesigning the football logo 
that appears on the players' helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Snyder, taking over a program that has won two games in the last 
three years, has decided that the snarling Willie the Wildcat insignia looked 
"a little bit like a kitten," according to Manhattan artist Tom Brookwalter. So 
he has replaced it with a stark, stylized profile, the Wildcat's mouth open as 
if to attack. 
</P>
<P>
Say what you will about Snyder, at least he's starting at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Annals of Advertising, Part II: Deion Sanders, first-round choice of the 
Atlanta Falcons, plans to have a line of fashions bearing his nickname -- Prime 
Time -- available by July. The line of leather jackets, sweat suits and 
headbands will be distinguished by a lightning bolt, apparently referring to 
another of Sanders' nicknames -- Lightning Man. 
</P>
<P>
Because Sanders has yet to prove himself in the National Football League, and 
because opposing players are glad to pounce on such arrogance, the Lightning 
Man may experience additional natural phenomena this fall. He is likely to hear 
thunder and see stars. 
</P>
<P>
Switch-pitcher: What do you say when your pitcher, who happens to be 
ambidextrous, decides to switch throwing arms in the middle of an inning? It 
happened at Alabama State University when Ricky King figured he would be better 
off right-handed against a Samford batter. 
</P>
<P>
Said the public-address announcer: "Ricky King is now making an equipment 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Lakers was born on the same day -- 
April 16, 1947 -- as what basketball first? 
</P>
<P>
But tractor-pull ratings were up: Perhaps there's hope for our civilization, 
after all. Early returns show that fewer than 1% of the potential pay-per-view 
audience tuned in to watch Robbie Knievel's motorcycle jump over the Caesars 
Palace fountain. 
</P>
<P>
The Real Prime Time: Kevin Mitchell made TV sportscasts everywhere with his 
barehanded grab of a foul fly ball last week. The San Francisco Giant left 
fielder had overrun Ozzie Smith's ball slightly and was not in a position to 
use his glove. So, with his back to the plate, he just snagged it with his bare 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Said an appreciative teammate, catcher Terry Kennedy: "He should have just 
ripped the cover off with his teeth and thrown it to the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago today: Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees did not play against 
the Detroit Tigers at Briggs Stadium, thus ending his streak of 2,130 
consecutive games played. Gehrig never played in another game. 
</P>
<P>
Perspective: Nolan Ryan long ago eclipsed Walter Johnson's strikeout total, a 
record that used to be regarded as a baseball standard, much as Babe Ruth's 
home run record was. But do you have any idea how much distance he put between 
himself and Johnson? 
</P>
<P>
Dave Anderson of the New York Times did some figuring and discovered that 
Ryan's 4,824 strikeouts (and counting) compare to Johnson's 3,508 this way. 
Relative to the other milestone, Ruth's 714 home runs, Ryan would have 980. 
When Ruth's record was broken by Henry Aaron, it was by a mere 41. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Fair Comment: Does Al McGuire live in the past a bit? Well, when 
his three-year contract as a college basketball commentator was announced, Phil 
Mushnick of the New York Post wrote, "It's worth close to $500,000 per year, or 
roughly $100,000 for every current player he's heard of." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The first game of the first National Basketball Assn. 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Catcher Bob Brenly of the Toronto Blue Jays on Canada: "They use 
Monopoly money. Milk comes in a bag. It's a very bizarre place."

ROY'S STREAK ENDS AS CANADIENS LOSE TO FLYERS

<P>
Patrick Roy's home winning streak ended Monday night as the Philadelphia Flyers 
defeated the Montreal Canadiens, 3-1, in the first game of the National Hockey 
League Wales Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Wregget turned in his second consecutive brilliant playoff performance with 
24 saves. Short-handed goals from Derrick Smith and Ilkka Sinisalo also helped 
snap Roy's 35-game home unbeaten string. Roy is 0-9 against the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a dream come true," said Wregget, who was acquired late in the 
season from the Toronto Maple Leafs and was used sparingly behind Ron Hextall, 
who has a strained knee ligament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to be playing," he said. "The guys are playing great in front 
of me, like they've been doing every round." 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers, coming off their worst regular season since 1971-72 -- they were 
fourth in the Patrick Division at 36-36-8 -- were a decided underdog entering 
the best-of-seven series. Montreal was 53-18-9, best in the Adams Division, in 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
But Philadelphia, which played a superb positional game, got the clinching 
score by Rick Tocchet after Montreal's only goal as Wregget played well again. 
Wregget replaced Hextall and beat Pittsburgh, 4-1, in the seventh game of the 
Patrick Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been sitting on the bench, yelling as loud as I can, and now I got a 
chance to contribute," Wregget said. 
</P>
<P>
Game 2 will be played at Montreal Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect them to come out guns blazing in the next game," Wregget said. 
</P>
<P>
The short-handed goals gave the Flyers a 2-0 lead. Shayne Corson then scored 
for Montreal before Tocchet got the final goal 63 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Wregget also had some praise for Roy, who made 23 saves but was victimized on 
breakaways on the two short-handed goals. 
</P>
<P>
"The odds were against him," Wregget said. "But it was a hell of a streak." 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored on a breakaway at 13:45 of the first period. With teammate Scott 
Mellanby penalized, Smith got a loose puck after Montreal defenseman Chris 
Chelios mishandled a pass at the point. Smith went in on a breakaway, faked 
right, making Roy commit, then easily beat the goalie to the left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a real blow when you have a short-handed goal scored against 
you," Montreal's Ryan Walter said. "They're a good short-handed team. We have 
to back each other up out there." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens also were healthy, except for right wing Claude Lemieux's groin 
injury. The Flyers were missing Hextall, Keith Acton and Murray Craven and had 
Tocchet playing with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers also lost one of their leading scorers, Brian Propp, 7:07 into the 
second period when he suffered a concussion and cut lip when elbowed into the 
boards by Chelios. Propp was taken off the ice by stretcher and went to a 
hospital for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like he will be OK," Flyer Coach Paul Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Poulin set up the second Philadelphia goal when he took the puck from 
Larry Robinson and hit Sinisalo breaking over the Montreal line. Sinisalo's 
weak shot trickled under Roy for his first goal.

DIGEST: RESEDA PLAYERS BARRED FOR PART IN BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reseda High officials have barred three players from playing on the baseball 
team following their participation in last week's game-ending brawl with Grant, 
according to Reseda Coach Mike Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Gone for the remainder of the season are senior left fielder Robert Gauteraux, 
senior first baseman Ron Stricklin and junior center fielder Joey Tushnet. 
</P>
<P>
All were starters and all were batting better than .300, led by Stricklin's 
.404 average. Gauteraux was hitting .328 and Tushnet was batting .320. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Coach Tom Lucero has so far taken no disciplinary action against his 
players. City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness is reviewing reports on the 
brawl that ended Tuesday's Valley Pac-8 Conference game after five innings. 
Grant won, 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
Harkness ordered the indefinite postponement of last Thursday's rematch between 
the teams and may cancel the contest. He also has the option of barring players 
who participated in the fight for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Stone objects to what he calls an injustice in the punishment meted out so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand by our administrators and I don't want to see any Grant kids kicked 
off the team," he said. "But I'd like to see some balance, some equality. I 
just want it known that we aren't the only ones punished. I'd really like to 
see our kids back playing, but I don't think that is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Rich Aude, a senior third baseman for Chatsworth High, has signed a letter of 
intent to attend UC Santa Barbara in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Aude, a two-year varsity member, is batting .443 with five home runs -- both 
team highs -- 28 runs batted in and 14 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Samuelson, a senior outside hitter for Cal State Northridge, has been 
selected to the All-Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. second team. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelson, 6-foot-6, was third in the conference in kill average (6.36 per 
game). 
</P>
<P>
Northridge finished 11-20 overall and 5-15 in conference play.

ROBERGE POWERS ST. FRANCIS TO WIN OVER PITCHING-THIN NOTRE DAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J. P. Roberge hit two home runs and drove in six runs as St. Francis defeated 
Notre Dame, 19-14, in a nonleague game at Notre Dame on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 9-2, after three innings, St. Francis scored four runs in the fourth 
inning, nine in the fifth, two in the sixth and two in the seventh to win. 
</P>
<P>
Roberge gave St. Francis an 11-9 lead with a one-out grand slam in the fifth 
and, after Chris Muir walked, Gregg Zaun hit a two-run shot that gave the 
Golden Knights (10-6-1) a 13-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the second in a row for Notre Dame (19-5), which lost to Lakewood, 
4-1, in the championship game of the Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
With sophomores Steve Colella and Cary Wichmann having pitched the previous two 
games, Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville was forced to go with a pitching lineup 
that included shortstop Oscar Macias, left fielder Chris Lohman, first baseman 
Kevin Milligan and second baseman Mickey McGuigan. The foursome was rocked for 
19 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Lohman and Chad Ratliff had three hits and two runs batted in for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
In another baseball game: 
</P>
<P>
Bel-Air Prep 19, Grace Community 9 -- Cal Frost and Chad Hankinson had three 
hits each, but Grace Community was hammered by Bel-Air Prep in the nonleague 
game at Sherman Oaks Park. 
</P>
<P>
Frost hit his third home run of the season -- a two-run blast -- in the seventh 
and had three RBIs for Grace Community (12-6). 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Jensen led Bel-Air Prep with four hits and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Poly 25, Grant 4 -- Jodie Soto had four hits and four RBIs and struck out six 
in four innings to earn a win in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game at Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Cameron had four hits and four RBIs for Poly (15-2, 9-0). Soto walked two 
and improved to 9-0 for Poly, which had 22 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 14, Louisville 5 -- First baseman Kerry Corcoran had three hits and 
four RBIs for Chaminade in a San Fernando Valley League game at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Nikki Mehringer had two hits, threw out three baserunners and stole 
five bases for Chaminade (14-5, 5-2). 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff 2, St. Genevieve 1 -- Tammy Sanchez (8-9) pitched a four-hitter, 
struck out three and walked three for Bell-Jeff in the San Fernando Valley 
League game at Olive Park in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 1-0, Bell-Jeff scored two unearned runs in the bottom of the sixth 
inning on a single, a stolen base and two throwing errors. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Carr singled to open the inning, stole second and went to third on Lisa 
Vasquez's bunt. She scored after Vasquez was safe at first on a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez scored when the St. Genevieve third baseman -- having taken the throw 
back to the infield -- tried to pick her off second base and threw the ball 
into center field. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' TRACK 
</P>
<P>
Channel League prelims -- Running on her home track, Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa 
had the fastest qualifying times in the 100 and 200 meters and teammates 
Danielle Tanner and Shannon Wiebelhaus did likewise in the 400 and 300-meter 
low hurdles.

<P>
The stock market gave ground Monday, faced with news suggesting persistent 
strength in the economy. But after an early selloff, prices recovered much of 
their losses. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed 3.84 points lower at 2,414.96. Declines 
led advances 833 to 577 in thin New York Stock Exchange trading of 138 million 
shares, compared to 158.4 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks sank from the opening bell as investors took a dim view of a survey of 
purchasing managers that suggested the economy rebounded in April, reviving 
fears that the Federal Reserve would further tighten credit to curb growth. 
</P>
<P>
But a late spurt of buying helped blue chips recoup most of their losses, 
leading to the modestly lower finish. 
</P>
<P>
"Sellers felt they had sold everything they wanted to and pulled away," said 
Philip Puccio, manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read. 
</P>
<P>
"The market simply doesn't want to go down," said Tom Walsh, Nikko Securities' 
chief of equity trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials have risen for the past five straight weeks, partly because 
interest rates are not likely to rise further, which has set the stage for 
profit taking, market analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The April purchasing managers' index rose to 53% from 50.4% in March. A reading 
of over 50% in the survey by the National Assn. of Purchasing Management is 
seen as showing that the economy is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said they expected little activity on Wall Street until Friday, when 
the Labor Department releases U.S. employment figures for April. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 3,049.719, down 3.413. 
</P>
<P>
Blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 2,784, compared to 
3,574 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets in Great Britain were closed Monday for a bank holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index finished at a new high. The 
225-issue Nikkei stock index gained 79.82, closing at 33,793.17. The index had 
gained 212.52 to set a 33,713.35 record close Friday.

</P>
<P>
The dollar wound up higher against all major currencies in a thin market Monday 
as the unexpectedly strong economic assessment from U.S. purchasing managers 
triggered buying. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices barely budged. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid 
of $377.45 an ounce, 5 cents lower than Friday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Late dollar rates in New York, compared to Friday's late rates, included: 
134.125 Japanese yen, up from 133.05; 1.89065 West German marks, up from

Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell as a result of the purchases' report. The credit market's

face amount. Its yield rose to 8.99% from 8.92% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
securities were down by 3/32 point to 3/16 point, intermediate governments fell 
1/4 point to 15/32 point and long-term maturities slumped from 17/32 point to 
21/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial data service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 3.05 to 1,129.69. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate issues declined. Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which

</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal

Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of grain and soybean futures rose strongly Monday on the Chicago Board 
of Trade in reaction to long-range forecasts of below-average rainfall in 
several grain-producing states. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, gasoline and crude oil prices rallied, cattle and hogs were 
up, and gold and silver prices gained moderately. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 4 to 6 1/4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in May at 
$4.23 3/4 a bushel; corn was 4 1/4 to 5 3/4 cents higher, with May at $2.74 a 
bushel; oats were 5 to 6 1/2 cents higher, with May at $1.84 1/2 a bushel, and 
soybeans were 12 3/4 to 17 3/4 cents higher, with May at $7.35 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst with Carson Petroleum Co. in Chicago, said traders 
who sold their gasoline contracts last week were buying the fuel and selling 
heating oil, betting that gasoline prices would rise. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 to 24 cents higher, with June at 
$20.66 a barrel; heating oil was 0.18 to 0.31 cent lower, with June at 49.46

'OUTPLACEMENT' COUNSELORS; 
</P>
<P>
HELPING SOFTEN THE BLOW OF HITTING THE PAVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After Jim Easton was told last year that his services as president and chief 
executive officer of a ceramics firm were no longer needed, his company hooked 
him up with an "outplacement" counselor to soften the blow and help him find 
another job. 
</P>
<P>
The counselor, from Irvine-based Executive Horizons, helped him feel "less 
fearful of what's going on in the outside world. He gave me a road map, a 
helping hand," said Easton, now an entrepreneur with his own business in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Easton is grateful that his former employer gave him someone to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually you're in a situation where you're being dumped, and it doesn't feel 
good," said Easton, who asked that his real name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasingly Popular 
</P>
<P>
Outplacement companies such as Executive Horizons, which also has offices in La 
Jolla and Los Angeles, number at least 200 throughout the country and are 
becoming increasingly popular among both employers and employees, according to 
personnel service experts. 
</P>
<P>
Companies may not be responsible for finding new jobs for the people they fire, 
said Charles D. Bearden, Executive Horizons' president and founder, but "they 
feel it's a good move, it promotes good feeling in the existing employees . . . 
and it minimizes the risk for legal action that is so prevalent in California." 
</P>
<P>
People sue employers for wrongful termination for hundreds of reasons, said 
William K. Ellermeyer, president of the Ellermeyer Co., a career development 
and outplacement firm recently acquired by Lee Hecht Harrison of New York. 
"They sue because of age discrimination, or sometimes it's sex discrimination: 
'You fired me and you hired a woman.' " 
</P>
<P>
An argument may not always hold legal water, Ellermeyer said, but often it will 
get the sympathy of a jury. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people very often sue when they're angry, when they think no one 
cares," said Rex Olsen, an Executive Horizons vice president. He said his 
company's services reduce an employee's anger, fear and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
Increased litigation costs were also cited by Jan Thompson, senior vice 
president at Drake Beam Morin, a New York-based career management and 
outplacement company that is widely regarded as one of the founders of the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half a Million for Jury Case 
</P>
<P>
"One local law firm that I work with here (in San Diego) tells me that an 
average settlement out of court for a wrongful termination lawsuit is $100,000, 
and that doesn't include the cost of depositions. If it gets to jury it's 
almost half a million dollars," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Most common are lawsuits in which an employee claims the company failed to 
honor an employment contract, said San Diego labor attorney Rich Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most common mistake that employers make is that they do not sit 
down in advance and prepare the case against (themselves). . . . How is the 
employee going to claim he or she was mistreated? Can we say with confidence 
that we have gathered all the facts . . . and that they really warrant this 
discharge? 
</P>
<P>
"Many wrongful discharge cases are filed not so much challenging the grounds 
for termination as challenging the way in which it was accomplished," Paul 
said. "The very big dollars in wrongful discharge cases have come where the 
jury finds some kind of . . . abusive conduct and the jury literally gets mad 
and awards substantial punitive damages." 
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of mergers and acquisitions has helped improve the 
visibility of outplacement in the past five years, said Bill Stone, president 
of SoCal Personnel Services in Kearny Mesa and president of the California 
Assn. of Personnel Consultants. "Obviously, when one (company) acquires the 
other, there's going to be positions that no longer fit, there's going to be 
duplication." 
</P>
<P>
"They're popping up all over," said Lee Rollins, manager of employee and 
organization development at San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. "I'm contacted on a 
regular basis by outplacement firms wanting to do business with us." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E maintains that few people will lose their jobs in the utility's 
proposed merger with Southern California Edison, but outplacement in some form 
will be offered to those who do. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Smith, vice president of personnel for Computer &amp; Communications 
Technology in Kearny Mesa, a manufacturer of recording heads for computer disk 
drives that recently laid off many employees, said a valuable aspect of 
outplacement is that it provides technical advice on how to get the next job. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, I find that many people don't understand . . . that securing 
another job is a job in itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Outplacement gives flexibility to firms wishing to make staff changes and sends 
a positive message not only to remaining employees but also to prospective 
employees. It can also help salve management's conscience. 
</P>
<P>
For the employee, outplacement often boosts his or her damaged self-esteem. 
Executive Horizons starts by reviewing a person's case with company management 
to make sure the employer will "protect the dignity of the client as much as 
possible," Bearden said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where will the termination take place? Have all of the facts been gathered? 
What will the termination pay be? Will his benefits continue and for how long? 
What will the individual be told and who will do the telling? We want to make 
sure that the employer has covered all of the necessary bases and that they are 
going to conduct this in as dignified an environment as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Employees are asked to complete a written assessment of themselves, 
concentrating on successes in their career and work-related preferences. The 
next step is a three-day workshop in which an Executive Horizon counselor helps 
the employee clarify or focus his objective. 
</P>
<P>
Resume preparation and extensive interview training are also included, as are 
lessons on telephone interviewing, using time effectively, keeping records and 
how to construct a network of business contacts for job hunting. 
</P>
<P>
For its services, Executive Horizons charges 10% of an employee's annual 
salary. For example, to terminate an employee who earns $50,000 a year could 
cost the company $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, of DBM, said her company also helps identify trouble spots in the 
layoff process. For example, some people deal with termination by "crying in 
their beer and telling others what an SOB their company is and blowing their 
references," she said. A company can also use the wrong words when terminating 
someone and wind up facing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"You will have every level of emotion, the full spectrum, from the very stoic 
person who expected it to happen to the person who expresses surprise and 
breaks down," Bearden said. "It's important that the terminated person . . . 
understands that he or she is not in a unique situation but that this happens 
to many people and there is life after his current employment." 
</P>
<P>
Most companies offer outplacement services only to upper managers, Bearden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone who is terminated is a bad employee," said Rollins of SDG&amp;E. 
"There are various reasons an individual is 'downsized,' " a term Rollins used 
to describe an employee laid off because of corporate cutbacks. "The 
probability of using outplacement is slim or none for someone we outright 
fired." 
</P>
<P>
Rollins said outplacement counselors from a series of firms are brought in to 
give customized help to terminated SDG&amp;E executives and high-level managers 
earning $75,000 or more a year. Those managers earning less are told they can 
go to an outside outplacement firm for help -- usually a two-day seminar on 
job-hunting tips -- at SDG&amp;E's expense. 
</P>
<P>
For people who are "way below that, we still provide them with some kind of 
outplacement counseling, but instead of one-on-one, we do it in a group," 
Rollins said.

TYPICAL CLIENT IS 44, MALE AND A VICTIM OF MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The average outplaced executive is a 44-year-old man who has been working for a 
company more than 10 years and has an annual salary of about $70,582. 
Typically, he is laid off as a result of a merger, acquisition or corporate 
cost-cutting measures. 
</P>
<P>
It takes about five months for the average outplaced executive to find a new 
job, but he will probably benefit from the fact that average severance pay 
lasts just over six months, according to a survey last year of nearly 900 
clients by Drake Beam Morin, a career management and outplacement firm 
considered one of the founding companies in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Out-of-work executives were younger, higher salaried and quicker to find jobs 
than they had been in the last seven years, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
The number of women clients, although still in the minority, increased 
slightly, from 11% to 13%, reflecting an increased number of women in middle 
management, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
Before losing their jobs, 25% of the people surveyed were general-management 
types, followed closely by corporate staff members (such as accountants and 
lawyers) and employees in finance, accounting, marketing and sales. 
</P>
<P>
A good portion -- 38% -- found higher paying jobs, 36% took a cut in salary and 
26% reported no change in their salaries. MAUREEN FAN

VALLEY FEDERAL'S STOCKHOLDERS UPSET AT STOCK PRICE, EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual meeting last Thursday of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan was 
marked by plenty of grumbling by stockholders. Then again, the Van Nuys-based 
thrift has given them plenty to grumble about. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal, with $3.44 billion in assets, lost $3 million in 1988 and last 
week reported a first-quarter profit of $178,000, compared with a $1.4 million 
profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
All Valley Acceptance, a loss-ridden Valley Federal subsidiary that provides 
loans for mobile homes, lost another $3.8 million in the quarter. Moreover, 
Valley Federal's management is not optimistic about the S&amp;L's overall 
results for the rest of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate disappointing results in subsequent quarters" if the recent rise 
in interest rates, which has cut Valley Federal's profit margins, does not 
quickly end, Jack Allewaert, chief operating officer, told shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Price Sliding 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal's shares, meanwhile, have been steadily sliding. The stock, 
which traded at $15 a share a year ago, last week sank to a 52-week low of 
$9.25 a share. On Monday, it closed unchanged at $9.75 a share in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
And a takeover of Valley Federal, which likely would provide the stockholders 
with an immediate premium price for their shares, has gone from looking 
imminent a year ago to looking doubtful any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel Holding Corp., the Glendale parent of Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan, has been talking with Valley Federal about a merger and has been 
reviewing the S&amp;L's books for the past several months. But at the annual 
meeting, Valley Federal President Dan E. Nelms reiterated that Citadel still 
has not made a firm offer to buy the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, Citadel offered $18.50 a share for Valley Federal, but the 
bid was never cleared by regulatory authorities, and within six months, Citadel 
abandoned the proposal, saying the S&amp;L was no longer worth that price. 
</P>
<P>
"We have urged Citadel at all of our meetings to complete their investigation 
and provide our board of directors with a firm offer for consideration," Nelms 
said. "We believe it is in everyone's best interest to resolve this issue as 
quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sale Plan 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Valley Federal's stockholders are losing patience with the thrift's 
sagging stock price. One investor came prepared to show Nelms that Valley 
Federal could raise a sizable amount of cash by selling some or all of its 45 
branches. The stockholder first asked Nelms how much a branch office would 
fetch and was told it often is calculated as a percentage of the branch's 
deposits. (Valley Federal's deposits total $2.5 billion.) 
</P>
<P>
The stockholder then sat down, toted up some figures on a piece of paper, again 
raised his hand and told Nelms that selling the branches could raise up to $21 
a share, or $120 million. Nelms did not comment on those figures and said only 
that such a plan is one of the alternatives being considered by Valley 
Federal's board. 
</P>
<P>
Several other shareholders asked not only about Citadel, but also whether other 
suitors are talking with Valley Federal about a takeover. (There have been none 
since early last year, Nelms said). 
</P>
<P>
The question of what Citadel might do continues to shadow Valley Federal. In a 
telephone interview, Samuel C. McCarver, Citadel's chief operating officer, 
said "the situation is still alive with Valley Federal, and we're still 
studying it." But he said Citadel is reluctant to make a bid until it knows the 
outcome of President Bush's plan to require S&amp;Ls to increase their capital, 
or net worth, as part of the administration's effort to bolster the ailing 
S&amp;L industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan won a major victory last week when the House Banking Committee 
voted to toughen capital standards for thrifts. A similar measure is working 
its way through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
At Valley Federal's annual meeting, another disgruntled Valley Federal 
stockholder suggested management consider a stock buyback to boost the price of 
the remaining shares. But Allewaert told the shareholder that is not a viable 
option because of the Bush plan. A buyback might only deplete the capital 
Valley Federal needs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, the stockholders approved management's proposal to 
reimburse businessman James J. Cotter for $347,869, the amount Cotter spent 
last year in a heated proxy fight to win a seat on Valley Federal's board. The 
proposal, which needed a majority approval, won 78% of the stockholders' votes. 
</P>
<P>
Cotter, who has repeatedly urged that Valley Federal be sold to enhance the 
stockholders' investment, did not come to the 45-minute meeting.

TOLUCA PACIFIC TOES LINE ON PENNY STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to his attire, stockbroker Peter Blowitz flouts convention. On a 
typical day, he roams his Toluca Lake office dressed in jeans, tennis shoes and 
an open-collar, long-sleeve shirt without tie. No pinstripes here. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to trading stocks, Blowitz, president and half-owner of 
Toluca Pacific Securities Corp., is a stickler for rules -- not just those set 
by regulators, but also his own. His Rule No. 1? Never trade stocks of new 
companies that were organized in Newport Beach or in Florida. "If they're from 
Florida or Newport Beach, I throw them in the trash," Blowitz said. "It's a 
reflex action. There's just too many bad deals down there." 
</P>
<P>
Blowitz, 45, can't afford to take chances. Toluca Pacific specializes in 
trading over-the-counter stocks, including high-risk, thinly traded "penny 
stocks" that typically sell for $1 or less. The penny-stock market long has 
been marked by manipulation, fraud and sorry investors who were hoodwinked by 
fast-talking brokers and bought worthless shares. 
</P>
<P>
But with the problem getting worse, the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
state authorities and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, or NASD, which 
governs the over-the-counter market, have cracked down on penny stocks, and 
Newport Beach and Florida are hotbeds of foul play, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
There are roughly 300 firms that deal in penny stocks nationwide. But in the 
last three years, the NASD has disciplined 25 of the firms, filed a total of 
182 disciplinary actions against firms and individuals, and handed out 
penalties ranging from expulsion from the NASD to $250,000 fines. An additional 
135 investigations are in progress, said NASD spokesman Enno Hobbing. 
</P>
<P>
Toluca Pacific itself has a pretty clean record. Since Blowitz founded the 
company in 1983, the NASD has cited the firm for only one minor violation: One 
day in 1985, the firm left out a stock when it gave the NASD the firm's trading 
volume for that day, and it was fined $250. The California attorney general's 
office has never taken action against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown if any investors have pursued successful complaints against Toluca 
Pacific, mainly because most stockholder disputes are settled by an arbitration 
panel of either the stock exchanges or the NASD, and those disputes are not 
formally made public. 
</P>
<P>
But Blowitz figures that penny stocks account for somewhat less than half his 
company's $3.5 million in annual revenue, and with all the turmoil in penny 
stocks, he tries to stay out of harm's way by taking the high road with 
low-priced stocks. How? Besides avoiding stock promoters from Newport Beach or 
Florida, Blowitz insists that he or his assistant personally execute every 
trade made by Toluca Pacific -- even though the firm has 90 brokers, five 
branch offices and 3,500 to 10,000 customers a year. This way, Blowitz knows 
every stock handled by his firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The buck rests here," said Blowitz, pointing a finger at himself. Blowitz, 
born and raised in Studio City, started the firm with $250,000 of mostly 
borrowed money. Before then, he had spent 14 years trading stocks in Los 
Angeles for small- and mid-sized brokerage firms, including Wedbush Corp. and 
Morgan Olmstead Kennedy &amp; Gardner Capital, two firms that have since merged 
to become Wedbush Morgan Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Even at those firms, Blowitz specialized in small, over-the-counter stocks, so 
he maintained that specialty with his own firm. Customers rely on Toluca 
Pacific not so much to trade IBM, but to trade such penny stocks as Meditech 
Pharmaceuticals (20 cents a share); United Leisure (87.5 cents), a recreation 
concern, and Warner Technologies (16 cents), a florescent lighting company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Stocks 
</P>
<P>
Toluca Pacific does not underwrite new stocks; that is, it does not buy all of 
the shares from a company and then try to sell them to the public. The firm is 
foremost a broker and trader, but its success in generating commissions rides 
in large part on finding successful stocks that enrich an investor, so he or 
she will come back and do business with Blowitz again. 
</P>
<P>
So Blowitz's brokers hunt for little-known stocks with promise. When a broker 
finds a prospect, three or four of Toluca Pacific's brokers will discuss the 
stock, perhaps invest in some shares and then decide whether to pitch it to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
One of Toluca Pacific's past winners was Air Cargo Equipment, a Long Beach 
maker of conveyor belts and other cargo-handling equipment. Toluca Pacific 
began buying the stock for $3 a share in 1986, and then Zero Corp. bought the 
company in 1988 for the equivalent of about $18 to $20 per share for those 
early investors, Blowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Toluca Pacific does not advertise -- a brief stint in the Yellow Pages drew a 
couple of investors who skipped on their bills -- but rather relies on 
recommendations for new clients. Toluca Pacific rarely makes cold calls, and 
that is unusual for a penny-stock brokerage firm. Such firms often rely on 
salesmen making high-pressured, cold calls to names out of phone books or 
various mailing lists. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone who has more money and more investment savvy is not going to look up a 
broker in the Yellow Pages," Blowitz said. "They're going to ask somebody who a 
good broker is, and then they're going to get our name." 
</P>
<P>
That might depend on whom they ask. Some brokerage executives in Blowitz's back 
yard, including the manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton's Burbank branch, said 
they had never heard of him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respected Among Traders 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of Blowitz's competitors said his approach works. "He is 
well-respected among the traders in our industry," said Norma Yaeger, president 
of Yaeger Securities in Encino. She said Blowitz "does try to associate himself 
with a better quality of people" and that he "keeps his integrity above 
reproach." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Blowitz is only as good as his brokers, since the brokers are the 
ones who serve Toluca Pacific's customers. He often urges brokers not to rush 
into a new penny stock, even if the company looks solid, because the stock's 
initial price is usually inflated relative to the company's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, 'Just wait,' " Blowitz said. Recently, for instance, his brokers 
were hot to buy the stock of a new mining company at $1 a share. "Six months 
went by, and the stock was a quarter. They wanted to buy it. I said wait. Six 
months later, the stock was an eighth," or 12.5 cents a share. "Then we bought 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the authorities' crackdown has meant that some firms have been shut 
down by regulators or have closed shop under pressure -- with both actions 
leaving stockholders with worthless shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Types of Scams 
</P>
<P>
Typically penny stock scams work in two main ways. First, many penny stocks are 
issued by "blind pools," shell companies that sell the stocks to raise cash for 
some unidentified future purpose. Many blind pools are legitimate, but many 
also are simply vehicles for crooks to quickly raise cash and then disappear, 
leaving their stockholders with empty promises. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the guys behind the deals, that put these things together, that are 
making the real money," Blowitz said. "And they just disappear and show up 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases the pool operators need a brokerage firm to peddle their penny 
stocks to the public, and that's where the second major scam occurs. Some penny 
stock firms are nothing more than "boiler rooms" where banks of brokers make 
100 or more cold calls a day to entice people into buying the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Because the market for many penny stocks is often controlled by just that one 
broker, the broker can rip off investors by marking up the stock by 100% or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
If the brokerage is crooked, it might buy thousands of shares of a penny stock 
itself when the stock first appears and help bid its price higher over the next 
few days. That makes the stock's public buyers happy because they have paper 
profits, and it encourages others to buy. 
</P>
<P>
But then the brokerage will sell its shares for an actual profit and refuse to 
sell shares for customers so they can profit too. And when the customers try to 
insist that their shares be sold, frequently they find that the firm has folded 
tent and disconnected its phones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mainstream Stocks 
</P>
<P>
Toluca Pacific, whose other half-owner is Stanley Brooks, its executive vice 
president, is no boiler room. The firm also is an active trader of such 
mainstream stocks as MCA, Walt Disney and Lockheed, and it handles options and 
other traditional brokerage services. Its main office, which is spread over the 
11th story of a modern high-rise, resembles any branch of brokerage stalwarts 
such as Merrill Lynch or Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
And even though Blowitz often focuses on small-ticket stocks, he refuses to 
take a back seat to those firms. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do anything Merrill Lynch can do, including commodities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But if a customer walks in Blowitz's door with his child's piggy bank and 
cracks it open, Blowitz can do business with him as well.

INFORMATICS DEAL IMPROVES STERLING'S PROFIT, NOT STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time it was viewed almost as something of a joke. Sterling Software, a 
computer software company in Dallas with $20 million in annual sales, launched 
a hostile takeover bid in mid-1985 for Informatics General, a Woodland Hills 
software firm 10 times Sterling's size. 
</P>
<P>
Informatics, then the nation's fourth largest independent computer software 
company, was being dragged down by two unprofitable divisions that had caused 
the company's overall profits to tumble. Its stock had plunged as well, falling 
to half of the $34 a share it was trading at in 1983. In addition, the company 
had $40 million in cash on its books, worth about $8 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Still, hostile bids in the software business were, and still are, rare. 
Conventional wisdom says it doesn't make sense to attack a company whose main 
asset -- the people who write the programs -- can bolt if they don't like the 
new bosses. 
</P>
<P>
But conventional wisdom proved wrong, and the gnat swallowed the elephant. 
Sterling bought Informatics for about $135 million, or $27 a share, in the 
first major hostile takeover in the software business. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearly four years since then, Sterling has made the deal into a fairly 
successful one. The company now posts healthy profits on its continuing 
operations. After it bought Informatics it moved quickly to trim nearly 200 
jobs in Woodland Hills and Canoga Park, largely corporate staff posts that 
Sterling's own corporate staff could do in Dallas. Today the company employs 
184 workers in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who had their hands on the business stayed. The people who were 
hangers-on are gone," said Werner L. Frank, a former Informatics executive who 
is now executive vice president at Sterling and heads operations at its Canoga 
Park offices. The belt-tightening has helped one Informatics unit swing from a 
$3-million annual loss before the deal to a $3-million profit today, executives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling also divided Informatics into three units, selling off six former 
Informatics operations with $50 million in combined sales. And Sterling 
restructured its debt to relieve the drain of interest payments to holders of 
the high-yield junk bonds it had to issue to raise money for the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
In the year that ended last Sept. 30, Sterling lost $1.8 million, although the 
main reason was a one-time, $8-million write-off stemming from the sale of 
assets. Its profit from continuing operations in the fiscal year was $4.6 
million on sales of $169 million. And for the six months that ended on March 
31, Sterling announced Monday a $5.3-million profit, up 56% from the same 
period a year earlier, with sales increasing 8% to $85.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
But dividend payments on preferred stock issued to finance the takeover 
continue to take a big chunk of Sterling's profit. For the year that ended 
Sept. 30, Sterling paid out $3.2 million of its net income in preferred 
dividends. For the six months that ended March 31, $1.6 million of its net 
income was paid out in preferred dividends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Stock Price 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the dividend payout is one reason why Sterling's performance has yet to 
be sterling when it comes to its stock price. On Monday, Sterling's shares 
closed at $6.50 a share on the American Stock Exchange, less than one-third the 
$21 a share it sold at three years ago shortly after the Informatics 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if Sterling's officers and directors did not own nearly half of the 
stock, the company might find itself in the same vulnerable takeover position 
that Informatics did before Sterling launched its bid. 
</P>
<P>
"Our stock is at an extremely attractive price," concedes Sterling Williams, 
the company's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling executives say last year's net loss helped depress the stock as did a 
slowdown in the overall computer business. Williams said he believes that 
investors are not very familiar with Sterling's basic operations. He said he 
believes the price will respond in time. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a group led by Sterling's managers briefly considered buying 
Sterling for about $9 to $10 a share, or about $60 million. But no formal offer 
was made. The company instead bought back about one-third of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling supplies software for mainframe computers and minicomputers, mainly to 
users of big IBM machines. Its software is designed for three main 
applications: to increase programmer productivity; for use in banking, retail 
and other businesses, and for defense and National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration work. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling was started in 1981 by brothers Sam and Charles Wyly. The company's 
growth has been something like a smaller version of Computer Associates, a New 
York firm that has also grown through acquisitions and with $1 billion in 
annual sales is the nation's largest software company. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Informatics, most of Sterling's acquisitions have been modest ones. 
Sam Wyly, who was one of the investors in the recent purchase of the Dallas 
Cowboys, is Sterling's chairman. But the company is run by Williams, whose 
first name inspired the name Sterling Software. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Audacious Bid 
</P>
<P>
Sterling's bid for Informatics at the time seemed audacious. But as other 
targets of raids have learned, size doesn't matter when a company is well armed 
with funds that can be raised through junk bonds issued through Drexel Burnham 
Lambert, the investment banking firm whose junk-bond pioneer, Michael Milken, 
is under indictment for securities violations. About $114 million in debt was 
raised by Drexel for the Informatics acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not have taken this step if it had not been for Drexel and their junk 
bonds," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling has since cut its debt from $114 million to $74 million. Sterling 
wanted to trim its hefty annual interest payments, so it refinanced its debt. 
Interest payments, which were as high as $14.5 million in the year that ended 
Sept. 30, 1986, fell to $9 million in the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Bauer, the former Informatics chief executive, said he does not follow 
Sterling's activities since the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, 65, was brought in during 1986 to serve as chairman and chief executive 
for Delphi Information Systems, a fledgling software firm in Westlake Village. 
Bauer has since turned over chief executive duties to Delphi's president, 
Richard Janssen. He says he is hoping to have more leisure time.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: WILDERNESS EXPERIENCE SEEKING SALE OR MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wilderness Experience, a troubled Chatsworth maker of outdoor and camping 
equipment, said it is negotiating a sale or merger of the company with 
unidentified parties because continued losses have left it facing liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Wilderness said its 
financial problems resulted in the company losing a $5.3-million contract to 
make footwear for a major retailer. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness also said additional financing for the company, which it had 
expected since November, did not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Because of previous losses, Wilderness filed for protection from creditors 
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws June 24, 1987, and a 
reorganized Wilderness emerged from Chapter 11 in July, 1988.

VALLEY EARNINGS: 20TH CENTURY PROFIT TRIPLES IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
20th Century Industries, a Woodland Hills insurance company, said its 
first-quarter profit more than tripled from a year earlier, to $29.1 million 
from $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
In recent quarters the company had lost money on its core business of 
underwriting auto and housing insurance, but had offset those losses with 
investment income. In the latest quarter, however, 20th Century reported 
operating income of $20.4 million compared with a year-earlier operating loss 
of $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 20th Century's investment income jumped 27% from a year ago, 
to $15.6 million from $12.3 million, further boosting its overall profit. 
</P>
<P>
20th Century also noted that the latest results compared favorably to last year 
because, in the year-earlier quarter, heavy rain and flooding in Southern 
California -- where 20th Century does most of its business -- led to sharply 
higher claims costs.

NEW PROJECTS PUSH OFFICE VACANCY RATE TO 15% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley office vacancy rate climbed to 15% in the first quarter 
of 1989, the highest it has been in nearly two years, according to a survey by 
the realty firm Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of last year, the vacancy rate fell to 12%, matching the 
five-year low. Howe S. Foster, senior vice president at Grubb &amp; Ellis, 
attributed most the first quarter's increase "to the half-million square feet 
of new office space that came on line in the East Valley" market. The East 
Valley, dominated by the entertainment industry, covers Burbank, North 
Hollywood, Studio City and Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you have that much new space hit the market at one time in one 
quarter, you can expect the vacancy rate to climb temporarily," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, in the first quarter the office vacancy rate was 14% in downtown 
Los Angeles, and 13% in both West Los Angeles and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley survey covers the area from Newbury Park to Burbank. In the first 
quarter, there was 2.8 million square feet of vacant office space from an 
inventory of nearly 18.9 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures, however temporary, mark a distinct change in the office 
market. Since mid-1986, the Valley office market had been tightening, with the 
vacancy rate dropping from 21% vacancy rate to as low as 12%. Real estate 
agents have said the tightening market has meant landlords no longer have to 
make as many concessions to get tenants to sign long-term leases. In part, the 
tightening market has been because of building restrictions along Ventura 
Boulevard and a budding slow-growth movement urged by residents. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey, the Central Valley market, which includes Encino, Sherman 
Oaks, Van Nuys and Northridge, posted the lowest vacancy rate at 13%, while the 
East Valley area had the highest vacancy rate at 16.1% 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Technology Corridor, which includes Calabasas and Thousand Oaks, 
usually posts the highest vacancy rate because of its more remote location. But 
builders there have been convinced that lower rents along the Ventura Freeway 
will eventually attract new clients. In the first quarter, the vacancy rate in 
the Technology Corridor was 16%, down from 17.5% at the end of last year.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TEKELEC PROFIT INCREASES 13% FOR 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tekelec, a Calabasas maker of equipment that tests telecommunications products, 
said its first-quarter profit rose 13% from a year earlier on a 36% jump in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter that ended March 31, Tekelec's net income climbed to $1.24 
million from $1.1 million, and its revenue rose to $9.12 million from $6.73 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Tekelec said that U.S. orders for its equipment were lower than expected in the 
first quarter, but that international demand remained strong. Tekelec said its 
profit gain was limited because of new-product costs and higher engineering, 
marketing and customer-service spending needed to support its increased client 
base.

GEORGE STRAIT'S WHITE-BREAD BRAND OF DISTILLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Let's hope George Strait has had all his inoculations. If not, he's bound to 
catch something from all those flower-bearing babes he kissed between songs 
Sunday at the Pacific Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
But then, the health risk was the only risk the big-grinnin', big-hatted Texan 
took in a show marked by a superficial and safe nature that pretty much summed 
up the sad state of country music, 1989. And there's no vaccination for 
vacuousness. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's show left little doubt that the whistle-baiting hunk's success is due 
as much to his looks as to his music -- a Strait-arrow, white-bread 
distillation of Texas swing and honky-tonk, without a hint of the innovative 
genius associated with such pioneers as Bob Wills and Hank Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't to say that Strait and his solid Ace in the Hole Band are without 
merit. His voice is as shiny as his teeth, and the band has a natural feel for 
the styles. But you'd never know from their version of the Wills arrangement of 
"Milk Cow Blues" or from such facile Strait hits as "All My Exes Live in Texas" 
that Wills' fusion of hillbilly music and swing jazz was explosive and 
inventive. 
</P>
<P>
An even better (?) example of sanitized regression came from opening act 
Baillie &amp; the Boys, which draws not upon country, but its very distant 
relative, '70s California pop a la Karla Bonoff and Wendy Waldman. 
Second-billed Kathy Mattea fared a bit better, thanks largely to her pure alto 
and winning personality. But there's little in her twang-pop to distinguish 
her; these songs would sound the same done by any pure alto with a winning 
personality. STEVE HOCHMAN

Director Francis Coppola ("The Godfather") has been made an honorary citizen 
Monday of Bernalda, Italy, the birthplace of his paternal grandfather. The 
Detroit-born Coppola's grandfather, Agostino Coppola, was a native of the small 
town in the Basilicata region of southern Italy, and emigrated to the United 
States just after the turn of the century. Claudia Puig

A $2.5-million movie that was to be actor Hal Holbrook's directing debut has 
shut down before filming began because its producers ran out of money. "There's 
nothing much I can do about it," Holbrook told the Associated Press Saturday as 
he left Fayetteville, Ark., for New York. "I'm the director of this film and 
I'm out of a job." Filming of "Staggerwing," the story of a real-life bandit, 
was supposed to have begun Wednesday in Bentonville. Filmtrust, a Little 
Rock-based group, was producing the movie. Earl Bond, a co-founder of 
Filmtrust, said Sunday that the principal investor, whom he declined to 
identify, had backed out after committing to spend $1.5 million.Claudia Puig

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN; 
</P>
<P>
NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR LIKE FRESH AIR FOR SYMPHONY 
</P>

<P>
Yoav Talmi's appointment as the San Diego Symphony music director is welcome 
news to the San Diego music community. 
</P>
<P>
In five guest appearances over the past two years with the local orchestra, the 
Israeli musician has established his credentials as a persuasive conductor with 
a refreshing sense of orchestral programming. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi is a musician's musician. He is thoughtful and probing, more concerned 
with substance than with packaging. His track record as an orchestra builder, 
notably with the Israel Chamber Orchestra, where he was music director from 
1984-88, is precisely what the San Diego Symphony needs at this stage of its 
musical recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Others have pointed out Talmi's strong character and the stability of his 
personal life as highly desirable virtues -- especially for a music director 
taking the position vacated by former music director David Atherton, whose 
indiscretions were divisive, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
If there are any apparent shortcomings, it is Talmi's lack of personal 
charisma. The passion he elicits from an orchestra -- and this he does well and 
without histrionics -- is not evident in social situations. Perhaps the Israeli 
conductor's quiet manners and earnest musicianship will endear him to the local 
community much as the decidely unflashy Herbert Blomstedt has won over the San 
Francisco Symphony audiences and the wider Bay Area community. 
</P>
<P>
It is not entirely fair to say that Talmi is clearly a better conductor than 
the other candidates -- two seasons of guest conductors who have come through 
San Diego for the equivalent of musical one-night stands. Regular symphony 
patrons and the local critics simply have had more opportunities to hear Talmi 
than the others. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Klee, a sophisticated German who was through more than once, made the 
local symphony sound quite elegant, and he had a special touch for the music of 
Berg and Webern. Klee, however, claimed he had no desire for the 
responsibilities of the San Diego post. 
</P>
<P>
Another West German whose hat was supposedly in the ring, Christoph Perick, 
would have brought the most cachet to San Diego; in opera circles especially he 
presides over the most prestigious podiums. 
</P>
<P>
Perick will appear twice next season as a guest conductor, presiding over the 
hearty German fare that is his calling card, but not as music director 
designate. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi has won that title. May he wear it well. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvians are coming. Wednesday night the 90-voice women's chorus from 
Latvia, Dzintars, will bring its unique sound to San Diego's First Presbyterian 
Church. Although this ensemble has won many choral competitions in Europe, its 
monthlong California tour is its first North American foray. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have been generous in tossing bouquets to these belles of the Baltic. 
Jesse Hamlin of the San Francisco Chronicle praised their "purity, precision, 
and dynamic subtlety" when they sang earlier this month at Davies Symphony Hall 
in downtown San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Like the popular Bulgarian women's choirs, the Latvian group specializes in 
folk music, but it also champions the choral music of contemporary Baltic 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of each of their American programs, it sings all five verses 
of "America the Beautiful" in both English and Latvian. 
</P>
<P>
And where else will you hear that? 
</P>
<P>
The eyes have it. Scripps Memorial's Mericos Eye Institute in La Jolla and 
Point Loma's National Vision Research Institute see eye to eye on one issue. 
Each organization is holding a musical fund-raiser featuring a noted solo 
musician this season. 
</P>
<P>
On May 6, at La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium, pianist Leonard Pennario will play 
a benefit program for the good folk at Mericos. At 65, Pennario remains the 
keyboard virtuoso who played chamber music with Heifetz and Piatigorsky in his 
heyday. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, classical guitarist Pepe Romero will play a benefit recital for the 
National Vision Research Institute at the First Unitarian Church in Hillcrest. 
Romero's program will feature the Spanish repertory for which he is known, 
including works by Giuliani, Sor, Sanz and Lauro. He will be joined by his 
teen-aged daughter, Angelina, who will accompany him on the piano in a sonatina 
by Diabelli. Angelina's participation in the recital, which marks her musical 
debut with her father, is particularly apt for this event. Ten years ago, 
Angelina was treated by National Vision's Dr. Perry Binder for a traumatic eye 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Just say, "No!" Principal trumpet Calvin Price of the San Diego Symphony 
recently won his audition with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Price joined the 
local orchestra last summer, and his stellar contributions to the performance 
of the brass section have not gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
The pull to return to Pennsylvania is strong. Price grew up in the Philadelphia 
area and toured with the Philadelphia Orchestra on four European tours from 
1982-87. At the moment, Price says he is considering whether he will give up 
his first-chair position with the San Diego Symphony for the position of second 
trumpet and assistant principal with Philadelphia. As Nancy Reagan taught us, 
Calvin, "Just say, 'No!' "

"The Hollywood Chronicles," a 26-episode cable series examining the history of 
the American film industry, is scheduled to begin airing on the Discovery 
Channel this fall. The series plans to give "an overview from the silent era to 
the present" and will consist mainly of old film clips and current interviews 
with older stars reminiscing "about Hollywood in its earlier years," according 
to a spokeswoman. Facets Entertainment Group President Rick Melchior is 
producing the series along with James Forsher ("Hollywood Uncensored," 
"Hollywood's Hidden Secrets") and Gail Melchior. Each half-hour episode will 
focus on a different aspect of Hollywood. Claudia Puig

KLON CONCERT REFLECTS L.A. MUSIC HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Segregation was so much a way of life in Los Angeles in the 1950s that two 
largely separate musical styles evolved. One, predominantly white and low 
calorie, was represented in a marathon concert dubbed "West Coast 
Jazz"presented Sunday by KLON at the John Anson Ford Theater. The other, 
generally more aggressive sound will be represented May 28 at a "Central Avenue 
Revisted" concert with a virtually all-black cast at the same venue. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a value judgment. What was heard Sunday involved nine groups. Only 
two of the leaders were born and raised in Los Angeles, and only five now live 
here, but the opening set by Shorty Rogers' Giants was typical of the neatly 
packaged, good-humored sounds Rogers built around an instrumentation similar to 
that of Miles Davis' "Birth of the Cool" group. 
</P>
<P>
The French horn and tuba were put to good use in "Bunny," with Bill Perkins' 
alto replacing that of the late Art Pepper, for whom it was written. The 
10-piece band came alive more vividly with Bud Powell's "Un Poco Loco," and 
showed its blues credentials in "Martians Go Home," with a minimalist clarinet 
solo by Jimmy Giuffre. 
</P>
<P>
The planning left much to be desired. Three long sets by Bob Brookmeyer, 
Giuffre and Bob Cooper, all using the identical rhythm section, could better 
have been combined into a single, more diversified set using all three horns. 
However, Cooper's solo set was distinguished by his reading of Duke Ellington's 
"Prelude to a Kiss," an eloquent offering that was clearly the crowd's favorite 
of the exceedingly long event. 
</P>
<P>
Hersh Hamel, a bassist, almost brought the show to a halt with his endless gab 
about the Chet Baker years. Finally, he played a decent enough Mulliganesque 
set with Bill Perkins as Mulligan and Bobby Shew as Baker. 
</P>
<P>
The Dave Pell Octet was a trimmed-down version of the laid-back Shorty Rogers 
California trip, with Lucy Ann Polk recalling the era vocally. 
</P>
<P>
A set by trumpeter Jack Sheldon, whose quintet was recently reviewed in the 
Times, was followed by a reunion of the Chico Hamilton Quintet, whose members 
deftly rekindled the spirit of that original group with handsome readings of 
"My Funny Valentine" and Buddy Collette's "Blue Sands." 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Bud Shank had the dubious honor of closing the concert, which was 
running nearly two hours late; but he managed to maintain interest with a 
spirited, if somewhat dated, revival of his 1957 quartet.

'TEEN WITCH': HACKNEYED PLOT UNDER A HEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Try this at home, kids: Watch a really preachy "Afterschool Special," but use 
the remote to switch channels intermittently, being sure to hit the occasional 
MTV rap video, a "Bewitched" rerun or two, and plenty of commercials in which 
pretty young people hold brand names up to the camera. 
</P>
<P>
Congratulations. In less-than-scientific and highly cost-effective conditions, 
you've just reproduced the exact experience of paying $6 to watch "Teen Witch" 
(citywide), complete with teen wish-fulfillment fantasies, condescending 
moralizing, asinine musical montages, horrifying pop songs, French kissing, 
blatant product plugs and Dick Sargent (formerly of "Bewitched"). 
</P>
<P>
Switch witchcraft for werewolves, and the hackneyed plot of "Teen Witch" could 
easily be that of "Teen Wolf" or a dozen others like it: Unpopular 
high-schooler develops magical powers, becomes the most popular kid in school, 
then decides rather unconvincingly at the end to make a stand as a 
garden-variety mortal after all. 
</P>
<P>
Robyn Lively is the plain-Jane type whose 16th birthday brings the power to 
cast spells. High on her list of potential recipients: hunky but unavailable 
Dan Gauthier, who looks as if he's auditioning for GQ. 
</P>
<P>
Be forewarned that this is a high school where, bewitched or not, the youth 
occasionally break into song (or white rap) and dance -- including a memorably 
ghastly "I Like Boys" production number in a locker room that might have poor 
Busby Berkeley doing about 1,600 RPM in his grave. 
</P>
<P>
Among the supernatural vets on hand is Sargent, whose casting as Lively's dad 
is the movie's one good joke. Its one good line goes to its resident psychic, 
Zelda Rubinstein (who else?), who advises her teen charge to go ahead and use 
Love Potion No. 9, explaining, "Falling in love is just a trick anyway -- the 
right hair style, the right music. . . ." But Zelda also has the movie's worst 
line: "The real magic is believing in yourself. If you can do that, you can 
make anything happen!" 
</P>
<P>
Guess the makers of "Teen Witch" (rated PG-13, but aimed at an under-13 
audience) just didn't believe in themselves enough.

OAKLAND BALLET'S 'BILLY THE KID' AT PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
True, 'Billy the Kid" is a beloved icon of Americana. But that doesn't keep it 
from resembling a stylized puppet show. Especially when the stage, a perfect 
jewel-box setting like that of the Smothers Theatre at Pepperdine University in 
Malibu, cannot provide resonating space for the landmark dance semaphores that 
the late Eugene Loring originated 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was to this otherwise ideal platform that the Oakland Ballet brought its 
1976 production of "Billy" on Saturday, staged by the choreographer. Again, one 
had to marvel at his invention no less than his intent. 
</P>
<P>
But when Loring's gallery characters of the old West push across the plains to 
meet their destiny, they need a frame large enough to give dimension to their 
pronounced gestures, so clearly symbolic. And when Copland's miracle score, 
with its long lines of wistful tenderness, suggest distance and solitude, we 
want to see what we hear. 
</P>
<P>
The cast compensated, however. In the title role Michael Myers went from the 
truly bereft and horrified youngster who watched as his mother was shot down to 
the defensive outlaw forever marked by that attack. He made Billy Cagneyesque 
-- a small tough-guy, quick to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
Towering above him was the square-jawed Ron Thiele as the friend, Pat Garrett. 
The size difference between them lent their eventual enmity a touch of pathos 
and underscored Billy's tragic alienation. Michael Lowe, as Alias, met his 
multi-character challenge convincingly and Patti Owen, in the Mother/Sweetheart 
roles stressed simplicity over preciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Other items showed the company to conventionally balletic advantage -- strong, 
supple, fluent and expressive.DONNA PERLMUTTER

'EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE' GLOSSES GRIM MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The message delivered by John Zaritsky's documentary "Extraordinary People" 
(tonight at 9 on Channels 28 and 15, 10 p.m. on Channel 50) is decidedly mixed. 
By choosing to focus on the resilient abilities of three male Canadian victims 
of the deformity-causing drug thalidomide, it tends to emphasize -- even 
romanticize -- the indomitable human spirit, and pushes the meaning of the 
thalidomide tragedy to the background. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this mixed view is expressed by "thalidomide child" Alvin Law, who 
comments that it's no use blaming anyone for what happened, and is then seen 
organizing with other Canadian thalidomide victims to pressure their government 
for compensation overdue by at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Thalidomide was a drug thought to suppress morning sickness in pregnant women, 
but caused horrible deformities in babies, if they lived to birth. More than 
8,000 known victims were born between 1959 and 1962 in several countries 
outside the United States (where it was never approved, due to the resistence 
of Dr. Frances O. Kelsey of the Food and Drug Administration). 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean that the United States was spared. More than two million 
tablets were distributed free, and given to 20,000 patients. Between 10 and 16 
known thalidomide babies -- perhaps more -- were born in the United States. 
These facts were documented by British journalists but appear nowhere in 
Zaritsky's film. The film's rather bald assumption that the thalidomide story 
is well-known, stated here by host Judy Woodruff, results in gliding over some 
of the most crucial and obscure dimensions of the story. 
</P>
<P>
It is certainly remarkable when the camera trains on the armless Law as he 
plays a very mean set of jazz drums with his feet, or when it shows how 
thalidomide children, naturally used to the sensations in their flipper-like 
feet or arms, often successfully resisted being fitted with artificial limbs. 
Law, like the film's other subjects, Randy Warren and Paul Murphy, exhibit a 
humbling sense of honesty, self-esteem and altruism. 
</P>
<P>
But the outrageous thalidomide legacy is more than the gallery of portraits in 
strength that Zaritsky presents. It is the result of governments neglecting to 
watchdog profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, and a stern warning that it 
could happen again.

New York City students barricaded parts of four more City University campuses, 
pushing the total to 14, as sit-ins protesting proposed tuition increases and 
budget cuts entered a second week. State University students in Purchase, N.Y., 
mounted the first serious solidarity protest. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had until 
midnight today to sign legislation authorizing the universities' budgets. By 
vetoing a budget increase, Cuomo would force cuts in faculty and services. 
Leaving the budget language unchanged would allow trustees to enact a proposed 
$200-a-year tuition increase. Full-time CUNY students now pay $1,250 a year.

Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's independent union Solidarity, has accepted an 
invitation from the AFL-CIO to make his first trip to the United States and 
speak at the AFL-CIO convention in Washington in November, the Washington Post 
reported. Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, said this is the third 
time that Walesa has accepted an invitation from the federation. On the 
previous two occasions he was not given permission to leave Poland. However, 
Solidarity regained its legal status this year, and the Polish government has 
allowed Walesa to travel abroad.

An Oakland woman was arraigned for allegedly letting two men sexually abuse her 
6-year-old son for $20 apiece -- money police believe she used to buy cocaine. 
Joanne Brooks, 26, a convicted prostitute who told police she has been using 
cocaine for five years, was charged in Oakland Municipal Court with two counts 
of procuring a child for lewd and lascivious acts. Brooks is alleged to have 
allowed the men to commit oral copulation on the boy. Police said the boy, the 
oldest of Brooks' three children, described the sex acts and told them he still 
loves his mother "but she did wrong, and I won't forgive her." Brooks claimed 
that her son was lying and that she would never do anything to harm him.

Syrian gunners and their Lebanese allies sent rocket and artillery fire arcing 
into Christian areas in a fierce new barrage in the capital city of Beirut. At 
least three people were killed and four wounded. Fires flared from burning 
apartment blocks and cars as shells and projectiles from rocket launchers 
thundered across the Christian enclave, witnesses said. The shelling, the 
heaviest in 10 days, followed the breaking of an Arab League-mediated truce. 
Syrian guns also pounded Christian areas north of Beirut. Druze leader Walid 
Jumblatt, whose forces are allied with Syria, demanded that Christians oust 
their leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, as a condition for peace.

A Kern County waste disposal firm was fined $150,000 by state Health Director 
Ken Kizer and ordered to correct alleged toxic pollution violations at its 
Buttonwillow facilities. Department of Health Services inspectors said 
Petroleum Waste Inc. failed to implement a required emergency contingency plan 
following the exposure of three employees to hazardous wastes, failed to submit 
a written report on the incident to the state and inspectors noted what they 
called poor laboratory management practices. Kizer said most violations have 
been corrected.

A San Diego County prosecutor's son was sentenced to 11 years in prison for 
bank robbery. John Hewicker III, 25, sobbed quietly as U.S. District Judge J. 
Lawrence Irving pronounced the punishment in San Diego. Defense attorney Ramon 
Castro told Irving that his client had unresolved emotional problems and "was 
crying for help" when he committed the robberies. Irving sentenced Hewicker to 
six years in prison for the Dec. 2 robbery of a Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan 
branch in which $800 was taken and the Dec. 16 robbery of a Flagship Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan in which $250 was stolen. Hewicker is the son of Deputy 
Dist. Atty. John Hewicker II.

KAUS EXPECTED TO DIRECT JAILHOUSE INFORMANT PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired California Supreme Court Justice Otto M. Kaus is expected to be named 
shortly to direct a grand jury investigation into whether Los Angeles County 
law enforcement officials misused jailhouse informants, the attorney general's 
office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the impending appointment was greeted with enthusiasm by local 
prosecutors and defense lawyers, who expressed confidence in Kaus' ability to 
conduct a thorough and fair-minded probe. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is expected to center on allegations by informants that they 
have faked confessions -- sometimes with the help of law enforcement personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an outstanding selection," said Robert Berke, a defense lawyer 
who has pressed for the appointment of a special counsel since last year on 
behalf of the 2,000-member California Attorneys for Criminal Justice. "He has 
unquestioned integrity and he is not associated with any of the parties in 
this. He is unquestionably bright and will conduct a thorough investigation. 
That's all we've been asking for." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Thompson, whose office joined the defense 
bar's request in January, said: "We encouraged the grand jury inquiry because 
we think it best addresses the issue of public confidence in the system. To 
this end, Justice Kaus fills the bill. . . . We look forward to working with 
him on what is a very important issue to the district attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp confirmed through a spokesman that he has asked 
Kaus to serve as special counsel for the grand jury "to investigate allegations 
of official misconduct by prosecutors, law enforcement personnel or jailers in 
connection with the use of jailhouse informers in criminal proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
"Van de Kamp," the spokesman said, "is expected to formally designate Kaus as 
special counsel in accordance with the attorney general's statutory authority 
shortly." 
</P>
<P>
A well-placed source said that Van de Kamp was waiting as a matter of courtesy 
to see if the county Board of Supervisors, which must foot the bill for the 
special counsel, objects to the choice of Kaus. The board is not required under 
statute to approve the selection. 
</P>
<P>
Barring an objection, Kaus is expected to head a team of attorneys from 
Hufstedler, Miller, Kaus &amp; Beardsley, the prominent downtown law firm where 
he is a partner. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure on California's high court from 1981 to 1985, when he 
retired, the 69-year-old Kaus achieved a reputation for common sense, wit and 
first-rate legal scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have reportedly agreed to provide him with some investigative 
staff, although no details of this could be learned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Another source said Kaus was selected by the attorney general more than a week 
ago, but that announcement of his being named was held up as a result of a 
dispute over money, with the county counsel's office unwilling to provide the 
funds Kaus wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Counsel Fred Bennett did not respond to a telephone message 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Kaus declined to comment on his selection. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Grand Jury Foreman Robert D. Leland said he had not been 
informed of the impending appointment. "It's news to me," he said. "I'm glad to 
hear it." 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury asked for an attorney to direct a probe of jailhouse informants 
after a longtime informant, Leslie Vernon White, demonstrated for jailers that 
he could gather enough information to fabricate the murder confession of a 
defendant he had never met. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration last fall called into question the district attorney's use of 
jailhouse informants, who have testified in about 200 cases, mostly involving 
murders, in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the district attorney's office advises the grand jury. However, in 
this case, the district attorney's office had a potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, whose term expires July 1, made a series of requests, beginning 
in January, for the attorney general's office to appoint a special counsel to 
direct a grand jury investigation.

TAFT HIGH TEAM WINS U.S. TITLE IN ACADEMIC DECATHLON COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A team of seniors from Los Angeles' Taft High School, after matching wits for 
two days with some of the nation's brightest high school students on subjects 
ranging from physics to fine arts, on Monday were declared winners of the U.S. 
Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three years that a Los Angeles school has won the 
coveted national title. In 1987, a team from Marshall High School in Silver 
Lake became the first Los Angeles Unified School District team to win the 
decathlon. Taft, in Woodland Hills, placed second in last year's competition. 
</P>
<P>
Taft team members leaped, screamed and hugged each other and their parents 
after the announcement at the awards banquet Monday for the nearly 400 students 
who were entered in the 10-subject academic contest. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so high right now, I don't know when we're going to come down," said 
Taft team member Shawn Canter. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, the nine Taft students had studied together in class, after 
school and on weekends, poring over study outlines and preparing for tests in 
geography, mathematics, economics and literature. Students were also required 
to deliver speeches, write essays and be interviewed by judges during the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"After nine months, this is the baby," Canter said. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team scored 45,857 out of a possible 60,000 points to defeat teams 
representing 36 states, as well as Northern Ireland and Brazil. Taft 
represented California in the national competition after winning the state 
title in March for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows the kind of education that is possible in our district," said Dan 
Isaacs, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District's High School 
Division. The Taft team captured the district title in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft victory over second-place Deer Park High School in Deer Park, Tex., 
was particularly sweet, team members said. The team from J.J. Pearce High 
School of Richardson, Tex., narrowly defeated the Taft contingent in the 1988 
national academic decathlon. There were no returning members from last year's 
Taft team, all of whom were seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it was just California's turn," said Ronny Harris, Deer Park High 
School decathlon coach. "When we fell behind in the Super Quiz, I started to 
get concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The national finals appeared to be shaping up as a showdown between Texas and 
California long before the event started Friday. The Texas team had scored more 
points than any other winning team in the state championships, except for Taft. 
</P>
<P>
The only clue of a California victory was Taft's first-place finish in the 
Super Quiz, the only event of the academic decathlon that is held before an 
audience. In the seven years of the contest, winners of the Super Quiz, which 
this year was on the U.S. presidency, have usually gone on to win the national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Scores 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team scored particularly high in essay writing and interviews, as well 
as in fine arts, geography and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
Under contest rules, the teams were divided evenly among students with A, B and 
C grade averages. Taft senior Michael Pocrass scored the highest number of 
points among all C students in the competition, earning $6,000 in scholarship 
prize money. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Sarti earned the fourth-highest point total among all A students, and Andy 
Rosenthal also placed fourth among all B students. 
</P>
<P>
Pocrass said he was surprised by his showing because he, as well as teammates, 
believed that the tests in the national Academic Decathlon were more difficult 
than those in the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coach Surprised 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally surprised," said Arthur Berchin, the Taft English teacher who 
coaches the academic decathlon team. Both the Texas and California teams were 
called to stand in front of the assembled students before the judges announced 
the overall winner. 
</P>
<P>
"They took so long I was going into cardiac arrest," Taft team member Rosenthal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Taft's Rodney Crump, who won four individual medals and followed Pocrass 
with the second-highest number of points among all C students, said all day "I 
had a positive feeling that it was our time to win." 
</P>
<P>
Berchin, who quit an administrative post at UCLA to teach the Taft group, said 
he is relieved that the competition is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be their teacher, and I don't want to be their coach anymore," 
Berchin said. "I just want to enjoy them." 
</P>
<P>
On the Taft campus Monday, there was joy and pride at news of the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"They're much more socially well-rounded than people think," student body 
President Josh Stenger said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the team includes a varsity basketball player, a drama student 
and a student government leader. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just call them nerds, because they aren't," said Stenger, a friend 
of many of the decathlon members, as he arranged the letters in a 
congratulatory message on the marquee in front of the school. "They all have 
other things to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Chris Allen said, "It's kind of cool to come to a school where they're 
into studying that much."

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD HIKES WAGE OFFER TO TEACHERS 1.5% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education on Monday announced that it was increasing 
its three-year wage offer to teachers to 21.5%, an increase of 1.5%. But the 
head of United Teachers-Los Angeles said the new offer was unacceptable, 
leaving the Los Angeles Unified School District on course toward a May 30 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
In a hastily called press conference at board headquarters downtown, board 
President Roberta Weintraub said the district will raise its offer of a 4% 
increase next year to 5.5.% because of unexpected state revenues and lottery 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
The board's last offer -- 8% this year, 4% in 1990 and 8% in 1991 -- provided 
that 60% of any new money that becomes available be added the the second year's 
raise up to a maximum of 8%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Money 
</P>
<P>
School officials determined Monday that the district will receive an extra $10 
million to $12 million from the lottery. In addition, on Friday, the district 
learned that its share of a $660-million state income tax surplus could be as 
much as $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials said they are not sure how much of the money can be used 
for teachers' salaries because the state may earmark the money for specific 
goals, such as reducing class size. 
</P>
<P>
The district estimated that about $16 million of the surplus would be 
unrestricted, and 60% of that amount is about $10 million. Sixty percent of the 
$12 million in lottery funds would bring the total for teachers' salaries to 
about $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
The revised offer shows that "this board honors its commitments," Weintraub 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing this in anticipation that it will avoid (a strike). We're 
doing it because it is what we said we were going to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labor Dispute 
</P>
<P>
However, union President Wayne Johnson said the new offer was insufficient to 
settle the yearlong labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is grandstanding on the part of the board . . . It's an attempt to 
formulate public opinion against teachers," he said. "We want that money 
applied to this year's offer." 
</P>
<P>
The union wants a 21% raise over two years -- 11% this year and 10% in 1990. 
But Johnson has said that a 10% raise this year, combined with concession on 
certain non-monetary issues, could be sufficient to head off a strike. 
</P>
<P>
The board was divided 4 to 3 on the district's earlier offer of 20% over three 
years, as well as on Monday's revision. The district maintains that $80 million 
in budget cuts are needed to pay for the 20% wage package. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Leticia Quezada, Rita Walters and Alan Gershman have largely 
opposed making such deep cuts in other areas to pay higher teacher salaries. 
The union says the district has surpluses in several accounts that could be 
re-allocated for teacher raises. 
</P>
<P>
The union voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike on May 30, which is about 
three weeks before the end of the school year. The district and union officials 
agree that a strike could disrupt graduation ceremonies, promotions and other 
year-end activities. 
</P>
<P>
The union says it will not report final grades to the district if there is a 
strike but will give copies to students to take home. Teachers normally report 
final grades to district offices.

NEW ETHICS PANEL SHUNS TIES TO BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first act of Mayor Tom Bradley's special panel on ethics in government 
Monday was to distance itself as much as possible from the mayor and the City 
Council, in part by seeking outside funding. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member panel of civic and religious leaders, appointed by Bradley one 
day after his surprisingly narrow reelection April 11, agreed at its first 
meeting to organize itself as an independent organization, probably as a 
nonprofit corporation, and not take any funds from Bradley, his political 
action committee or the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stress on Independence 
</P>
<P>
"We will be most effective, most credible . . . if we are independent," said 
Geoffrey Cowan, former state chairman of the political watchdog group Common 
Cause, whom Mayor Bradley asked to head the panel. The group hopes to get its 
estimated $125,000 budget from private foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Formation of the panel was one of several moves by Bradley in recent weeks to 
deflect criticism and restore confidence in the wake of conflict-of-interest 
inquiries into his ties with financial institutions that do business with the 
city. The mayor, citing news reports in the closing weeks of the campaign on 
his relationships with Far East National Bank and Valley Federal Savings and 
Loan Assn. as a factor in his relatively poor (52%) election showing, said the 
city needed a tougher, clearer set of ethical guidelines for city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said the group will not be involved in the city attorney's investigation 
of Bradley's finances or pass judgment on any of the disclosures concerning the 
mayor's activities, concentrating instead on developing a new code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not an adjudicatory body, we're a legislative body," said Cowan. "We're 
writing a code for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The ethics committee's initial meeting, over takeout lunches at the offices of 
the Los Angeles County Bar Assn., came as City Atty. James K. Hahn and City 
Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg were preparing the first official reports on 
Bradley's financial ties for a City Council hearing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear just what the officials will report, but it is likely that their 
remarks will be brief; the committee has allowed just one hour to consider five 
council motions and hear from the two witnesses. A spokesman for Hahn said, "He 
is not going to be in a position to discuss details in order to maintain the 
integrity of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, chairman of the Governmental Operations Committee, has 
scheduled a press conference today to explain what role the committee intends 
to play in the investigation into Bradley's finances. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Police Department identified the two investigators 
it has assigned to help Hahn's inquiry as Gary Ingemunson, 41, with 19 years 
LAPD experience, and Det. James Heisdorf, 59, with 28 years on the force. 
Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth declined to give details on their aspect 
of the investigation. Both men are experienced bunco-forgery detectives, Booth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn has asked for Police Department help because his office lacks the 
resources for such investigations, a spokesman said. The department has helped 
on other investigations, including ones involving the Housing Authority and 
General Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has acknowledged that he was paid $18,000 as an adviser to Far East 
National during 1988, while the bank had $1 million in city deposits. Bradley 
has said he only learned of the deposits this March and had resigned from the 
bank at year end. He has since returned the money he was paid to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inquiries Last Year 
</P>
<P>
But documents obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act 
indicate that Bradley's office made inquiries last year to the treasurer's 
office and to the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency on behalf of Far 
East. The answers to the inquiries showed that the city was doing business with 
the bank and indicate that Bradley was probably aware of the business ties. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Bradley has acknowledged being paid thousands of dollars over many 
years by Valley Federal, while the firm had numerous zoning matters before the 
city. Bradley resigned as an emeritus director of the thrift board the day 
after the election. 
</P>
<P>
At the ethics panel meeting Monday, Cowan, without referring specifically to 
Bradley, said: "Times of crisis of this kind are also times of opportunity. 
When there are lapses of ethical integrity, there is an opportunity to make 
something better." 
</P>
<P>
The committee also includes attorneys Antonia Hernandez, president of the 
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund; Margaret Morrow, president 
of the county Bar Assn.; Gilbert Ray, a partner with the firm O'Melveny and 
Myers; and retired Superior Court Judge Delbert Wong. The other members are 
Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony and Rabbi Allen Freehling of the 
University Synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who spent Monday working in his office, said through a spokesman: "I 
am pleased that the panel is off to a strong and independent start." He said he 
agreed that they should take the steps necessary to be independent, and Bradley 
added, "I hope the City Council is eager to join in the effort" to adopt a 
strong, effective code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting With Ferraro 
</P>
<P>
The panel voted to meet as soon as possible with City Council President John 
Ferraro, whose help it will need in getting its recommendations adopted as a 
city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
But the panel has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said he hopes to complete a draft report by Labor Day and a final report 
by October, but acknowledged that the process could take longer. 
</P>
<P>
Among the immediate hurdles are finding financing, organizing itself as a 
nonprofit corporation or affiliating with an existing group, and selecting a 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
The group's preliminary budget of $125,000 includes $32,500 for an as yet 
unselected executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony called obtaining financing from private firms "the least dangerous, the 
least invasive" way to go.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUILTY PLEA MADE IN DEFENSE FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Northrop Corp. engineer pleaded guilty Monday to participating in a 
defense fraud conspiracy and admitted that he helped fake test results on 
critical stabilization systems for the Navy's Harrier jet. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Hyde, 48, of Yorba Linda, who was a senior engineer in an arm of 
Northrop's Precision Products Division in the San Gabriel Valley, acknowledged 
in federal court that he helped falsify vibration test results for 189 rate 
sensor assemblies Northrop made for the Harrier fighter-bomber jets, which were 
built by McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The government paid $1.6 million for the rate sensor assemblies to stabilize 
the jet, which is capable of vertical takeoffs and landings like a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde, who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United 
States and two counts of making false statements to the government, faces up to 
15 years in prison and a $750,000 fine when he is sentenced by U.S. District 
Judge Pamela Rymer on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde worked for Northrop's Western Services Department, which was located in El 
Monte and later in Pomona and was closed in late 1987 in the wake of 
revelations of the falsified tests.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 14 SCHOOLS STUDIED FOR ETHNIC RATIO HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education voted 4 to 3 Monday to begin a study on 
changing the ethnic ratios at 14 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several months, the district will conduct surveys of parents and 
faculty at each school to determine if they believe that their schools would 
become segregated under a formula that would allow the minority enrollment to 
reach 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Current district policy allows the 14 schools to have enrollments that are no 
more than 60% minority. 
</P>
<P>
The schools that will be studied are Palisades and University High, and 
Chapman, Seventh Street, Fullbright Avenue, Reseda, Shirley Avenue, Winnetka 
Avenue, Gledhill Street, Herrick Avenue, Mayall Street, Plainview Avenue, Tulsa 
Street and Mount Washington elementary schools. District officials say the 
ratio change is needed to enable those schools to receive more students from 
overcrowded campuses in heavily minority areas of the district.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO RULING ON LAW FOR WHISTLE-BLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles declined Monday to rule immediately on a 
constitutional challenge to a federal whistle-blower law, which allows private 
citizens with knowledge of fraud against the government to file lawsuits on 
behalf of the government. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William D. Keller called the False Claims Act "a very 
extensive, very carefully crafted statute," but issued no final ruling and 
expressed no opinion on several points of legal attack. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Parker Hannifin Corp., the subjects of a 
whistle-blower lawsuit alleging $175 million in overcharges on the Apache 
helicopter program, have asserted that the statute is unconstitutional and 
allows private citizens to sue on behalf of the government when they have no 
legal standing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"The private individual comes in and assumes the mantle of the nation to 
prosecute these actions; no control, no accountability, no nothing," complained 
McDonnell Douglas lawyer Robert F. Scoular. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Senate Legal Counsel Morgan Frankel told the judge that dozens of 
similar statutes have been upheld.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE FLEXIBILITY IN SCHOOL CHOICE VOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New permit policies that will allow parents in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District greater flexibility to choose their children's schools were 
unanimously approved Monday by the Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The newly adopted policies expand the number of students eligible for transfers 
to schools closer to child-care facilities and for the first time allow 
transfers to district schools closer to where parents work. 
</P>
<P>
The job-related transfers will be issued only to students whose parents work 
full time, can show proof of employment and have a note from their employer 
that gives permission for the parents to go to the school in case of an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the child-care transfer permits can be renewed annually 
until a student finishes the highest grade at the school to which the transfer 
was granted, but parents will be required to verify each year their need for 
the permit. 
</P>
<P>
Also included are guidelines to ensure that the transfers do not cause a school 
to become racially segregated.

MIDGETS ARE BACK, AND IN A BIG WAY; 
</P>
<P>
RACING'S RETREADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midget auto racing, crippled and almost left for dead by television in the 
1950s, is undergoing a renaissance of sorts -- thanks to the same medium. 
</P>
<P>
During the Depression and the early post-World War II days, when there was 
little air conditioning and TV was still in the future, many folks spent their 
long summer evenings watching the midgets. From 1934 to 1948, excluding the war 
years, there were midget races somewhere seven nights a week from April to 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore Stadium, located where CBS Television City now is along Beverly 
Boulevard, was the showcase for the sport. The track, built around a football 
field, averaged 10,000 fans every Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
And every other night of the week, for 40 cents most places, a fan or a family 
could see racing at Culver City, Atlantic Stadium in South Gate, Southern 
Ascot, Loyola, Huntington Beach, Saugus, Balboa Stadium in San Diego, 
Bakersfield, San Bernardino, Colton and even the Rose Bowl and the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 17, 1946, there were 65,128 spectators in the Coliseum when Sam Hanks 
won a 250-lap midget race. It was the largest midget car crowd in history. 
</P>
<P>
Then, like Saturday morning movies and Hula Hoops, the craze faded. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the people who had watched the little buzz-bombs were sitting at home, 
watching pictures moving in their own living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, Gilmore Stadium was sold and that year's Thanksgiving Night Grand 
Prix, won by Bill Zaring, was its last race. Most of the other tracks had 
already shut down, many to make way for burgeoning housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
The United States Auto Club, formed in 1956, kept midget racing alive, but 
barely. The late J. C. Agajanian promoted the first USAC midget race in the 
country at Saugus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Saugus will host a USAC Western Regional race Saturday night on 
the same third-mile paved oval. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, the only midget race of much significance each year in Southern 
California was Agajanian's annual Turkey Night Grand Prix on Thanksgiving. On 
most occasions, when Ascot Park scheduled other midget races, the fields were 
small and the stands were nearly empty. 
</P>
<P>
Enter TV. ESPN to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of years of experimenting with telecasts of midget races from 
both the Speedrome in Indianapolis and Indianapolis Raceway Park in nearby 
Clermont, Ind., ESPN decided to expand. It is programing 13 weeks of midget 
racing, eight at Ascot and five at IRP. 
</P>
<P>
The ESPN shows are produced each Thursday from Ascot Park and are shown live 
from 7 to 8:30 p.m., with former Indianapolis 500 and Turkey Night Grand Prix 
winner Parnelli Jones as commentator. The 30-lap main events, part of ESPN's 
Caterpillar Thunder Series, are also part of the USAC Jolly Rancher Western 
States championship series. 
</P>
<P>
The response has been highly favorable. 
</P>
<P>
From the drivers: 
</P>
<P>
"Midgets are definitely making a comeback," said Rich Vogler, five-time USAC 
midget champion and a veteran of 18 years of racing in nearly every form of 
car. "There is no comparison between the atmosphere today and five years ago as 
far as number of cars, drivers, places to race and media attention." 
</P>
<P>
From the sanctioning body: 
</P>
<P>
"This year we are getting calls from all over the country from promoters who 
want midget races," said Bill Marvel, USAC vice president. "We have 101 midget 
races scheduled this year, and the expansion into new territory and the 
exposure on TV has made it much easier for drivers and car owners to find 
sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
From race promoters: 
</P>
<P>
"We have about double the number of cars every week that we had five years 
ago," said Ben Foote, Ascot Park vice president. "Because we start the program 
so early (5:30 p.m.) in order to get in the heat races, the crowds have been 
rather small but already we are noticing that spectators are dropping in from 
nearby plants. It gives them a chance to have some entertainment while the 
freeways get unclogged." 
</P>
<P>
From ESPN: 
</P>
<P>
"I think having midgets on the air is good for motor racing," said Larry Nuber, 
motor sports announcer. 
</P>
<P>
"From an excitement viewpoint, if you extract the big-name recognition of 
Unser, Andretti, Rahal, Mears, etc., midgets offer a lot more entertainment 
than an Indy car race. If someone turns on TV and sees Rich Vogler flipping in 
Turn 2 at Ascot and then we close in for a shot of him climbing out of his car, 
it definitely catches their attention. Things happen a lot quicker, and a lot 
more often, in a midget race than an Indy car or Formula One race." 
</P>
<P>
From the fans: 
</P>
<P>
"We close down the shop every Thursday, stoke up the barbecue, and sit around 
and watch those crazy cats in their open-wheel cars," said Richard Petty, stock 
car racing Hall of Famer. "I wouldn't want to get in one, but I wouldn't miss 
watching 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly, midget cars haven't changed much since the first race was held in 
June of 1933 in Sacramento. They still weigh about 900 pounds, have a wheelbase 
around 70 inches and look like scaled down sprint cars. 
</P>
<P>
"They look a lot like they did in the old days, but safety-wise they're about 
1,000% improved," said Vogler, who has been racing them since 1971. "And they 
have about double the horsepower." 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli Jones, who won 25 USAC midget races, including the 1966 Turkey Night 
race -- three years after winning the Indy 500 -- agreed emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
"The full roll cage makes them a whole lot safer," he said. "You see a lot more 
tangles, and more crashes, because the drivers have that cage around them. In 
my day, if you went on your head, you might be hurting for a month. Or forever. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, it's almost commonplace. Guys are driving with a lot less respect 
for what can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Examples are Parnelli's two sons, P. J., who turned 20 two weeks ago, and Page, 
16. They are both racing, P. J. in full midgets and in the American Racing 
Series, a training ground for Indy, and Page in the cut-down three-quarter 
midgets, or TQs. 
</P>
<P>
On April 22, P. J. flipped during a heat in Porterville, Calif., and got 
stuffed into the wall. Two nights earlier, Page had gone on his head in a TQ 
race at Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad called us the Flippers," P. J. said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Parnelli: "Naturally, I was extremely scared at first, like any other 
parent, when I saw them upside down. But I'm getting better with time. Those 
roll cages really help." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Jones boy was hurt in the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The little cars generate about 300 horsepower and run between 85 and 90 m.p.h. 
on the quarter-mile. 
</P>
<P>
"Back when I started, everyone was running Offies (Offenhauser engines)," 
Vogler said. "Then came the Sesco and in 1973, Red Caruthers brought out the VW 
for Bobby Olivero and it had 150 horsepower and blew off all the Offies. Now 
the Cosworth and the Pontiac and the new Aries that I use put out 300 
horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
"Sprint car technology has been transferred to midgets and it has made for 
closer and better racing because there are more cars evenly matched today." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy never hurt any competition and, as a driver, Parnelli Jones had his 
share of it. He punched out Eddie Sachs at the Indy 500 victory banquet where 
he was being honored as the winner, and he was suspended from the first 
Riverside off-road race by the late Mickey Thompson for allegedly practicing 
illegally, even though he was the only marquee name in the event. 
</P>
<P>
His older son, P. J., is like him. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, P. J. engaged in bumping and shouting matches with Sleepy Tripp, 
two-time national champion from Costa Mesa and the dominant driver in the 
Western States series since it was inaugurated in 1983. After a series of 
wheel-banging incidents at Reno, Ascot and other tracks, their feud came to a 
head June 6 at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp spun P. J. out and the youngster retaliated by waiting for the veteran, 
then ramming Tripp's car. USAC officials suspended Jones for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't blame Sleepy so much as I did the officials," Parnelli said. "They 
let things get out of hand until it was too late. Sleepy is a very good race 
driver, but he intimidates the officials and the other drivers. P. J. won some 
races and started to be a thorn in Tripp's side and he tried to bully P. J., 
but he didn't like it when P. J. gave him a pay-back." 
</P>
<P>
So far this year the feud has not resurfaced and all three, Sleepy, P. J. and 
Parnelli, insist they hope it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't pay to hold grudges when you race against the same guy every week," 
Parnelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Tripp and Jones finished 1-2 without a sign of a problem. It was 
Tripp's first victory on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Having his own son in a race he was commentating on had its embarrassing moment 
for Parnelli. 
</P>
<P>
After several cars had run low on the track and lost several positions in a 
recent race, Parnelli said: "That's dumb. You can't drive down there." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, P. J. took his car down low and, like the others, dropped back. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the place to be, for him, either," Parnelli allowed. 
</P>
<P>
You don't get rich driving midget cars, unless, like Vogler, you're on the go 
all week, every week. 
</P>
<P>
Winning the 30-lap USAC regional main event at Ascot, on the quarter-mile oval, 
is worth $625. Winning a national on a half-mile track is worth $1,000 or 
better, depending on the event. 
</P>
<P>
The May 12 Hoosierdome Grand Prix, for instance, will have a $35,000 purse. It 
will have 33 cars lined up three abreast, like the 500 two weeks later, and 
will be 500 laps on a fifth-mile paved oval. Vogler will be there. 
</P>
<P>
He may be racing's busiest driver. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after flipping in a three-car tangle at Ascot Park, he flew home to 
Indianapolis to drive a sprint car Saturday night at Rossburg, Ohio; a midget 
Sunday at Kalamazoo, Mich., and another midget Monday night in Louisville, Ky., 
as part of Derby Week. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to Speedway Scene, Vogler competed in 84 programs at 43 
tracks in 16 states with NASCAR sportsman, CART Indy cars, USAC champ cars, 
USAC sprints, winged sprints and midgets on 28 dirt tracks, 15 paved tracks, 
five one-mile ovals and the superspeedways at Indianapolis, Daytona, Pocono and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
He won 23 midget features and two sprint car events. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't count 'em, I just show up and race," the good-natured Vogler said. 
"Next week I'll be at Indy (for the 500) with the best shot I've ever had 
there. The Machinists Union has two 1988 Marches, with new Cosworth engines, 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Vogler has driven in the last four 500s, but crashed in three of them and 
failed to finish the other. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Fox, of Janesville, Wis., is another Indy 500 driver competing in the 
Thursday night series. Fox finished seventh as a rookie driving for A. J. Foyt 
in 1987, but completed only two laps last year before a broken half-shaft put 
him out. 
</P>
<P>
"A. J. is taking four cars to Indy next week and I hope I'll be in one," Fox 
said. "Of course, after seeing me here the other night he might have other 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Foyt, in town for the Long Beach Grand Prix in mid-April, dropped in at Ascot, 
where he had won the Turkey Night Grand Prix in 1970 and 1971, to watch the 
Thursday night racing. Fox, one of USAC's leading midget drivers, was in Foyt's 
Gilmore-Copenhagen colors. 
</P>
<P>
During the main event, Fox spun out -- twice. USAC has a rule that if a driver 
spins out twice in the same race, he is disqualified. This meant that Fox, whom 
Foyt came to watch, didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the best night of my career," Fox said, laughing.

JIM MURRAY: HE'S NOT OUT TO BE FRONT AND CENTER

I would not want to be Mychal Thompson. Just as I would not want to have been 
George Selkirk, Hunk Anderson, Babe Dahlgren, Gene Bartow or even Gene Tunney. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson probably doesn't know who most of these guys are -- but he 
will. 
</P>
<P>
They are sports figures I think of as guys who weren't. As in, the guy who 
wasn't Babe Ruth, the guy who wasn't Jack Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
George Selkirk is the guy who wasn't Babe Ruth. Hunk Anderson is the guy who 
wasn't Knute Rockne. Babe Dahlgren is the guy who wasn't Lou Gehrig. Gene 
Bartow is the guy who wasn't John Wooden. I think you know who Tunney wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson is going to join this ghostly company next year. He's about to 
become the guy who wasn't Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to be like following George M. Cohan on a vaudeville bill, taking 
over Patton's army or being the guest host on Johnny Carson's show. 
</P>
<P>
He gets the spot on the bill of the guy who came to foreclose the mortgage. 
Count Dracula would be a sentimental favorite by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing a legend is the quickest and surest way to unpopularity, if not 
obscurity. Selkirk, it so happens, was a pretty good ballplayer. He hit .312 
the year he replaced Babe Ruth. But he was no Bambino. He hit only 11 home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
His nickname was Twinkletoes. What kind of name is that for the substitute for 
the Sultan of Swat? Selkirk couldn't win. If he had hit 61 home runs, they 
would have hated him for that. 
</P>
<P>
Babe Dahlgren was a pretty good ballplayer, too. But he was no Lou Gehrig. He 
drove in 89 runs the year he took over for Lou. Not bad -- but Gehrig had 
driven in 184 one year. 
</P>
<P>
Heartley (Hunk) Anderson never got a chance to show whether he was a good coach 
or not. When he replaced Rockne, the Rock's teams had just gone two seasons 
undefeated. Anderson went 6-2-1 and 7-2 but got the gate the next year. 
</P>
<P>
All Gene Bartow ever heard when he was coach at UCLA was how Wooden would have 
done it. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson knows what he's in for. And he doesn't care for the sensation. 
First of all, he's being asked to replace a guy who is the leading scorer in 
basketball history with 38,387 regular-season points. That's 26,571 more than 
Mychal Thompson has scored. He's going in for a guy who has 18,440 rebounds. 
That's not the most in history, but it's 12,174 more than Mychal has. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem also has a half a foot in height and a 35-pound pull in the weight. 
Replacing him might be easier than playing him. 
</P>
<P>
But Mychal doesn't see why he has to do either. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they get someone," he said candidly the other day. 
</P>
<P>
In other forms of show business, understudies are players who secretly can't 
wait for the star to fall down stairs or get hit by a truck so that they can go 
out there and show the public how much better they are. 
</P>
<P>
It's Mychal Thompson's worst nightmare. Thompson is quite content with his 
off-the-bench role, with his role calling for him to jump in the game and give 
the regular center (or forward) a "blow" (respite from the action), drop in his 
9.2 points, suck up a few fouls, not win the game, but keep the team from 
losing it. 
</P>
<P>
He does this as well as or better than almost anyone else in the league. He 
played in 80 of the Lakers' 82 games this season, although he started in only 
eight of them and none last season. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal is not exactly in the famous "Bench me or trade me" frame of mind 
popularized by the late Chico Ruiz, but he would like it if the Lakers would go 
out and get somebody else to be Kareem Jabbar -- or rather not to be Kareem 
Jabbar. Mychal likes being the butler. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope they'd take that million and a half and get someone," he admits 
frankly. 
</P>
<P>
Pro basketball is the only major sport that has a salary cap for its employees. 
The union traded this off in return for getting 55% of the revenues. Its aim 
generally is not so much to save money as to equalize the competition, prevent 
some reckless billionaire from buying up all the available talent. 
</P>
<P>
Under its complicated formula, the departure of Kareem will leave the club with 
$1.5 million to get a pivot man. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson might be distressed to know that his coach wishes that the 
club, instead, would distribute some of that money to Thompson and stay out of 
the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to get for that money?" Pat Riley demands. "You're not 
going to get Patrick Ewing or Akeem Olajuwon or Robert Parish or Mark Eaton. 
For just an established center, they're going to begin the general negotiations 
by asking for a James Worthy or Byron Scott. We're not going to give them up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to tell management what to do, but I'd like to see them spread 
that money to Mychal and let's post him up. Mychal's 33 but he's a young 33." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect does not noticeably thrill Thompson. His attitude rather reminds 
you of the character in Lincoln's life who was tarred and feathered and ridden 
out of town on a rail and, asked how he felt about it, replied: "If it weren't 
for the honor of the thing, I'd rather walk." 
</P>
<P>
Mychal would rather sit. A cheerful fellow who never played basketball till he 
was 17 years old, Mychal's ambition is not to be the next Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
it's to be the next prime minister of the Bahamas, where he was brought up. 
</P>
<P>
But Thompson has had some hard-to-figure career turns before -- picking 
Minnesota as his college, for example. Mychal was bucking a huge trend going 
from the sapphire seas of the Grand Bahamas to the ice fishing holes of the 
Minnetonka. 
</P>
<P>
He'll get to be a trivia answer someday. But those ghostly images in the 
background shaking their heads and saying, "Don't do it, Mike" are guys named 
Selkirk, Anderson, Dahlgren, and maybe even the guy who shot Jesse James. 
</P>
<P>
They don't have to tell Mychal Thompson. He doesn't want to fill anybody else's 
shoes. Least of all, theirs.

MCCASKILL'S START TAKES EVEN MCCASKILL BY SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The job of Angel manager always comes with a few surprises attached and one 
Doug Rader encountered one of the first during a meeting of Angel coaches last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
The topic was pitching -- starting pitching, to be precise -- and Rader asked 
for a rundown of the team's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 starter? 
</P>
<P>
Easy one. Had to be Mike Witt. Even Rader knew that, his initial hunch being 
the perfect game Witt had thrown against Rader's Texas Rangers in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 starter? 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill, the coaches said. 
</P>
<P>
Rader's response? 
</P>
<P>
"Really?" 
</P>
<P>
The reaction was understandable, considering what Rader had to go on. In 1987, 
McCaskill had been 4-6 with a 5.67 earned-run average and one elbow operation. 
In 1988, the numbers had been 8-6 and 4.31, and the physical ailment was a 
nerve irritation that had made McCaskill's right forearm and hand go numb when 
he tried to pitch during the season's final two months. 
</P>
<P>
Then came spring training, 1989. In six games, McCaskill went 1-2 with a 6.49 
ERA, allowing 29 hits, 10 walks and three wild pitches in 26 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a final exhibition tuneup against Edmonton, McCaskill surrendered nine 
runs in 3 1/3 innings as the Angels lost to their triple-A farm club, 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
This was the Angels' second-best starting pitcher? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to tell you," Rader said on the eve of the Angels' season 
opener. "Mac is still a puzzle. I don't want to add to his burden . . . (but) I 
don't know how to straighten it out, other than to be supportive and hope he 
and Lach figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
Lach is Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann. Since then, he and McCaskill 
have tried a few things, thrown out a few others and agreed on a program that 
McCaskill has taken with him to the mound during his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
You might say McCaskill and Lachemann have figured it out. 
</P>
<P>
As the Angels open their second trip of the season tonight in Baltimore, 
McCaskill's record is 4-1. His ERA of 0.74 leads major league starters. He has 
been involved in two shutouts, has run off a consecutive scoreless streak of 18 
2/3 innings and had a no-hitter broken up in the ninth inning Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill's only loss was a 2-0 defeat to the Oakland Athletics on April 23, 
when Mike Moore, Rick Honeycutt and Dennis Eckersley combined to pitch a 
three-hitter against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Continue to color Rader surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what he did this spring and his recent history, this is almost 
inexplicable," Rader said. "I don't think there's any way in the world you 
could have handicapped this." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill has a tough time arguing that one. His march through April has 
stunned everyone in the Angels' organization, including the pitcher who has 
done the stunning. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you have an ERA of point-whatever, well . . . " McCaskill said. "I did 
expect to pitch well this year, but not to this degree. Right now, I just want 
to ride the momentum as long as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Only two starters concluded April with ERAs below 1.00 -- McCaskill and 
Cincinnati's Jose Rijo at 0.87. This is heady territory for McCaskill, who said 
he has led a league in ERA only once in his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, the Sea View Little League," he said with a grin. "I was just knocking 
'em down." 
</P>
<P>
As for what he has done to the American League at 28, McCaskill serves up a 
couple of quick theories. 
</P>
<P>
One is his arm. For the first time since 1986, when he went 17-10 with a 3.36 
ERA, McCaskill is attempting to complete a season without experiencing a 
throbbing elbow or a tingling forearm. He finished both 1987 and 1988 on the 
Angels' disabled list, but so far in 1989, the arm has been trouble free. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 2 is confidence. After 12 victories in two seasons, McCaskill had 
lost much of his, which was evident throughout his ragged training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of my problem in spring training was that I was pressing," McCaskill 
said. "We had a new manager and I was trying to impress him. Every time out 
there, I wanted to be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
When McCaskill found himself to be imperfect, his self-esteem -- and his 
pitching -- took a nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
It hit bottom, McCaskill said, after the exhibition against Edmonton, when he 
got knocked out in the middle of the 10-run fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I was embarrassed," McCaskill said. "I'd let my teammates down. I had to go to 
an Angel function the next day and I dreaded it. 
</P>
<P>
"But then everybody came up to me and said, 'Don't worry about it. No big 
deal.' They were kind of concerned about how I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, McCaskill's funk was killed by his teammates' kindness. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, that went a long way toward me getting mentally prepared for the 
season," McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, he started his first regular-season game against the Seattle 
Mariners and limited them to four hits in seven innings. He won that game, 2-1, 
and by mid-April, his record stood at 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing what a little confidence will do," catcher Lance Parrish said. 
"In this game, you can be your own worst enemy. Most of the time, you've got 
the ability, or you wouldn't be here. But if you're not capable of relaxing, 
you can't use your ability. 
</P>
<P>
"With each start this spring, Kirk got worse and worse, and he pressed more and 
more. Then, in his first start, he pitched pretty well and he's been able to 
build on each start since. He's built himself a pretty darn good base." 
</P>
<P>
Good enough to approach the standards McCaskill set in 1986, Parrish believes. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, I can't see any reason why he can't be a 20-game 
winner, especially if we score runs for him the way we should," Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill, the Angels' second-best starting pitcher? 
</P>
<P>
As of May 1, he has moved up to No. 1.

TRAGEDY HITS RACING FAMILY FOR THIRD TIME; 
</P>
<P>
OLDEST SON IS LATEST VICTIM AS HE DIES FROM CAR CRASH AT KALAMAZOO SPEEDWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Landon died racing. Not in the Indianapolis 500 or at LeMans. He was 
racing in a mini-champ race at the Kalamazoo (Mich.) Speedway Sunday night when 
the car in front of him spun out of control, clipped his car and sent it flying 
head-on into a retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Wayne Landon, and his mother, Ruth, were in the stands and saw the 
crash that caused the death of their oldest son -- their third child to die as 
a result of a car crash. Jerry, 33, of Freeport, Mich., was pronounced dead at 
1:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three years ago it was Wayne who was racing, at the old Hastings 
Speedway, when a wheel flew off his car and into the stands, killing the 
Landons' young daughter, Rita. Ten years ago, their second son, Terry, was 
killed in a crash on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
And now racing has claimed another member of the Landon family. But Wayne 
Landon is not holding that against racing. Indeed, he says he will probably 
race again himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry died with his boots on," Wayne said. "Racing was his life and racing was 
his love. He had just won the first heat of the season and was zeroed in to win 
the feature. He was doing what he loved. It was just one of those things that 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a son on the highway. But we didn't park the automobile and stop 
driving on the highway did we?" 
</P>
<P>
Mick Schuler, the promoter and announcer at the Kalamazoo Speedway and a 
longtime friend of the Landons, explained: "They love racing. Wayne has raced 
for 37 years and is a member of the Michigan Motor Sports Hall of Fame. Jerry 
was around racing, literally, from Day 1. Jerry had raced for 16 or 17 years. 
He loved it. 
</P>
<P>
"Mel Kenyon (a veteran race driver) was here recently and related to us a 
story. He said that he went to his 25-year class reunion and they did a poll 
asking how many people were doing something they really loved. Only five out of 
more than 200 people said they really loved what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Jerry Landon died doing what he loved best. He got a lot out of life. He 
thoroughly enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne told me last night at the hospital that Jerry was always helping his 
competitors, even when they might come back and beat him in the feature. And he 
continued to help people even after the crash. They kept him on life-support 
systems all through the night so the team of doctors could come from Ann Arbor 
for donor organs. 
</P>
<P>
"That family has been through so much, but they were there all night so that 
they could help others. That's the way they are. They are a good, Christian 
family, and that's going to help get them through this." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry's two sons, Christopher and Nicholas, were in the stands with their 
grandparents when their father crashed. Nicholas is 8. Christopher had his 
seventh birthday Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said that the 10 hours he spent at the hospital were the longest of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"Our family is pulling together now as best we can," Wayne said. "We had five 
children, and now we're down to two. Two daughters left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long, tough haul. We've been through it twice before, and we know it 
takes a long, long time. Things will jump out and slap you upside the head to 
remind you of them when you're not expecting it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Landon won the North American Mini-Champ Racing Assn. points title last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Mini-champ cars are miniature Indy-type cars powered by snowmobile engines and 
are capable of running up to 125 m.p.h.

Ben Johnson's doctor, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, bought large quantities of steroids 
for a rancher on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts to increase the size of 
cattle used for human consumption, according to testimony at the Canadian 
inquiry into drugs in sport at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hiatt, described as a U.S. businessman, said he first asked Astaphan -- 
then his physician -- to buy him steroids in 1983 for use on scrawny animals on 
the ranch he managed on St. Kitts. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan has been accused of supplying steroids to Canadian Olympic athletes 
including Johnson, who was stripped of his gold medal and world record in the 
100 meters sprint after testing positive for drugs at last year's Seoul Games. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier testimony from drug companies in Canada established that Astaphan 
bought large quantities of veterinary steroids but was never questioned about 
it.

TRIMARAN ON PACE TO BREAK CAPE HORN CHALLENGE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Georgs Kolesnikovs, sailing the 60-foot trimaran Great American in the Cape 
Horn Challenge from New York to San Francisco, said that if conditions hold, he 
will reach the finish line early on May 27 -- nearly three days ahead of the 
record set in February by Warren Luhrs' Thursday's Child, a 60-foot monohull. 
</P>
<P>
Luhrs finished in 80 days 20 hours, breaking the record of 89 days 8 hours set 
by the clipper ship Flying Cloud 135 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Kolesnikovs, who left New York with Steve Pettengill on March 10, spoke by 
radio telephone from near Robinson Crusoe Island off the coast of Chile last 
weekend. At the time, he said, the boat was running at 12 knots ahead of a 
quartering 20-25-knot wind and was 5,177.1 miles from the finish, according to 
satellite navigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked out our ETA (estimated time of arrival) for the first time today," 
Kolesnikovs said by radio-phone. "It's still a long way to go, so I'm not 
making any predictions." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kolesnikovs said he was more than 500 miles ahead of the pace set by 
Thursday's Child, despite warnings that he had left New York too late to find 
favorable weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, his passage around the horn -- notorious for breaking and sinking 
ships -- was unusually uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
Kolesnikovs said Luhrs might have erred by sailing into light wind when he took 
Thursday's Child too near the Chilean Coast after rounding the horn. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the more conservative approach," he said. "We were being headed in 
light winds, so we went south and west before turning north. Once you get out 
there, there's plenty of breeze." 
</P>
<P>
There have been several problems, Kolesnikovs said -- "Everything from a 
gooseneck (boom-to-mast fitting) cracking to the mainsheet (sail control line) 
pulling out to the roller (sail) furling falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have time for a lot of shakedown sailing, but our approach was to be 
self-sufficient. Steve has great mechanical skills." 
</P>
<P>
Kolesnikovs also said he and Pettengill feel well and have been eating well, 
having consumed about 1,000 pounds of the 3,000 pounds of supplies they put 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"We prepare fresh food and eat freeze-dried food only every other day," he 
said. "We're starting to lighten ship. We'll eventually (jettison) about 500 
pounds in excess food and gear over the next few days."

She says, "When Suzie was dying, we made a commitment to one another. She'd 
never say 'when I die.' She'd always say 'when I get well' but we both knew 
what that meant. She said, 'I don't want other women to go through what I went 
through.' " 
</P>
<P>
Susan Goodman Komen, fashion model and mother of two, died in 1980. She was 36. 
Two years later, Nancy Goodman Brinker founded the Susan G. Komen Foundation 
For The Advancement of Breast Cancer Research. "There were just the two of us 
(siblings)," Brinker explains, "and she also happened to be my best friend." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Difficult Time 
</P>
<P>
The final months of her sister's illness and the months that followed were 
rough for Brinker. There were the pressures of launching the foundation, job 
worries, a divorce and custody battle over her only child. But her marriage in 
1981 to Dallas businessman Norman Brinker after a whirlwind three-week 
courtship was a good one, and, as time passed, she was feeling "settled and 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1984, she recalls, "I was getting in bed one night and I put my hands 
under the sheets and ran over this hard little lump (in her left breast). I 
jumped a mile." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Brinker had had three benign breast lumps and she tried to reassure 
herself this was just another. But her doctor's diagnosis confirmed her worst 
fears: cancer. She was 37. "I sobbed," she says. "It's like someone stabbed you 
with a knife." 
</P>
<P>
Then came "all those flashback scenes," every vivid detail of her sister's 
"very long and painful struggle with breast cancer. I thought that I was going 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
For Norman Brinker, it also was the rerun of a nightmare. His first wife, 
tennis great Maureen (Little Mo) Connolly, died of ovarian cancer in 1969, 
three years after the disease had been diagnosed. She was 34 and left two young 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Today, five years since her diagnosis, Nancy Brinker's doctors tell her she has 
no signs of the disease. But with cancer, she says, "You just pray. You never 
know." She still suffers from attacks of the "checkup crazies." 
</P>
<P>
Brinker underwent a modified radical mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy that 
made her fatigued, occasionally nauseated and, she says matter-of-factly, "I 
was bald as a bowling ball." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Piece of Cake' 
</P>
<P>
Still, she can laugh and say, "People always say, 'Wasn't chemotherapy 
terrible?' It wasn't a piece of cake, but divorce was worse." 
</P>
<P>
And she had an immediate goal, to play in a polo match that summer. Both 
Brinkers are avid polo players -- he was a member of the 1952 U.S. Olympic 
equestrian team and founded the Willow Bend Polo and Hunt Club in Dallas. In 
August, 1985, one month after completing chemotherapy, she did play and 
recalls, "We won the game. To my embarrassment, my mother showed up on the 
field with a little oxygen tank." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Brinker since has undergone reconstructive breast surgery, as well as a 
preventive hysterectomy. A stunningly good looking woman, she has black hair, 
now grown back thick, pulled back in a chignon. Eschewing vanity, she wears 
bold red horn-rimmed glasses. She is 5-feet-10 and slender with a chic honed in 
four years as an executive trainee and assistant buyer with Neiman Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
She has no patience with "women who whine" and, besides, she has no time for 
that sort of self-indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday in Los Angeles, after speaking at a conference on diet and breast 
cancer sponsored by the Nathan Pritikin Research Foundation, she did an 
interview while packing for a weekend in Santa Barbara with her husband. "The 
first day I've had off in three years," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She routinely logs 120,000 air miles a year. Later this week she'll be off to 
New York to do a segment for Phil Donahue on women and crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Brinker is perennially named to "best-dressed" lists in Dallas and to 
committees for the right black-tie events. Norman Brinker, a self-made 
millionaire who stables strings of polo ponies in Dallas and Palm Beach, is 
chairman of Chili's, a Dallas-based chain with 200 restaurants nationwide, and 
former president of Pillsbury's restaurant group, which includes Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Socialite 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderful Norman," she calls him, shaking her head as she thinks about "that 
terrible thing that happened to Maureen." She does not identify with being a 
socialite. She would rather tell about being appointed in 1986 to the 
President's National Cancer Advisory Board, one of only six lay persons on the 
18-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
At home, she typically puts in an eight-hour day as founder-chairwoman of the 
foundation, which has a paid staff of only two at national headquarters in 
Dallas but a group of 1,700 women volunteers who know whom to ask for money. 
The ultimate power lunch may be the annual fall fund-raiser at which the 
foundation presents its Betty Ford Award to an individual who has increased 
public awareness and understanding of breast cancer. Last year's event, 
honoring Nancy Reagan, drew 2,200, including former First Ladies Ford and Lady 
Bird Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years after its founding, the Komen Foundation has raised $6 million to 
fight breast cancer, operates seven screening centers in four cities, has 
satellite groups in San Francisco, Sioux Falls, S.D., Peoria, Ill. and New York 
and supports 22 national research projects. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the foundation was responsible for pushing through the Texas 
legislature a bill requiring third-party insurers to pay for breast cancer 
screening tests for women 35 and over; nine other states, including California, 
have since followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Brinker is driven by one goal. She says, "I don't want other women to suffer 
the way my sister did." 
</P>
<P>
A brochure introducing the foundation, the only national group of its kind 
focusing on breast cancer, offers a startling summary: "During the 10-year 
Vietnam War, 57,000 men died in combat. During the same 10-year period, 330,000 
women died of breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Brinker knows the statistics well, and they are dismaying. In 1960, one in 13 
American women contracted the disease; it is one in 10 today. In speeches, she 
tells audiences, "Look to your right, look to your left. One in 10 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Each year, 40,000 women in the United States die of breast cancer, one every 13 
minutes, most victims of a disease that was well-advanced before detection. 
With early detection, before the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, a woman 
has a 93% chance of surviving disease-free for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Komen's treatment had been, she is convinced, "a botch-up." She speaks of the 
"four wrongs" of that case -- "the wrong city (Peoria, Ill., where Komen 
lived); the wrong doctor, who did not really want her to seek a second opinion; 
inappropriate treatment; and, on her part, wrong attitude." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Was Petrified' 
</P>
<P>
Brinker remembers that, when she and Komen were children, they had visited a 
great aunt in New York. The aunt had had a radical mastectomy and, Brinker 
says, "Suzie saw her undressed. She always carried that burning image in her 
mind. And she was petrified of having a mastectomy." 
</P>
<P>
She had the mastectomy but with neither follow-up radiation nor chemotherapy. 
Only 10 days after the surgery, she had a breast implant, which Brinker says 
was "totally inappropriate." Only after the disease had spread was radiation 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she died, Komen had endured nine surgeries and three courses of 
chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Her mission, Brinker says, is to "empower" women who develop breast cancer, to 
teach them what questions to ask and how to understand the answers. 
</P>
<P>
In her view, weapons in that fight include diet and life style changes, regular 
exercise, fewer fatty foods, as well as regular checkups, including monthly 
self-examination of the breasts, and, after age 35, screening by mammography. 
In Dallas, the foundation has made mammography available to indigent women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Stress Factor 
</P>
<P>
She is convinced, too, that stress plays a role. When she was going through her 
personal crises, she says, "I honestly think my immune system went somewhere on 
a handcart" and she became vulnerable to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Race for the Cure," the foundation's all-women's 5-K run each year in Dallas, 
attracts 2,500 participants. Now, Brinker is writing a book, to be published by 
Simon &amp; Schuster and tentatively titled "My Race for the Cure." She says, 
"It's a story about sisters and daughters and mothers. And a very personal 
story about my struggle with breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, she says, she wants the book, sales of which will benefit the 
foundation, to teach a woman stricken with breast cancer "to be an assertive, 
good consumer," one who can assemble a team -- surgeon, oncologist, radiologist 
-- "and have the three of them sit down with her in a room" and discuss 
options. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much fear out there," she says. She wants women to be armed with 
coping strategies. Among hers: Get your hair cut very short the day before 
starting chemotherapy. "When it starts to fall out, pull it out. I don't think 
anybody should wake up and find their hair on the pillow." And fight back in 
every way possible. "My friends who are fighters do better." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Brinker comes by her activism genetically. In Peoria, where she and her 
sister grew up in a big frame house with a front porch, her grandmother started 
the Red Cross chapter and her mother was president of the Girl Scouts. She 
recalls her mother telling her, "You'll never get anything done sitting on your 
duff." 
</P>
<P>
After graduation from the University of Illinois in 1968, Brinker decided to go 
West, to Dallas. Before her marriage to Brinker, she was a radio and television 
reporter and talk show host there. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the foundation is her job. In 1987, it expanded its scope with creation 
of the Susan G. Komen Alliance for Breast Cancer Research, Education and 
Treatment, a triumvirate that includes the foundation, the University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and Baylor University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance's goal is a national network of researchers, specialists and 
treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the foundation has funded research at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, 
the National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Md., the Peralta Cancer Research 
Institute in Oakland and the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
She does not expect a cure for breast cancer in her lifetime. But she thinks 
that cutting the mortality rate in half by the year 2000 is possible. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, she admits, "I've had enough (of) cancer," sometimes she would like 
turn the work over to others. But then she will hear of someone else who has 
been diagnosed with the disease. "I just can't tell you how many friends I've 
lost," she says. "I just can't tell you."

CUOMO URGES ISRAEL SUPPORT IN L.A. SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo may not have been the obvious choice to speak at a 
gathering of the Los Angeles Jewish community, but he was welcomed with open 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo spoke at the Unity '89 dinner Sunday night at the Century Plaza, 
co-sponsored by the United Jewish Fund, the Jewish Federation Council of 
Greater Los Angeles and the State of Israel Bonds, Los Angeles Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Gov. Cuomo has always been someone who relates to American Jewish causes," 
said Ed Sanders, dinner chairman. "He talks about America being a mosaic, and 
he has spoken about his immigrant parents. Everyone thinks (having him speak) 
is just right, which is unusual. We rarely speak in one voice. Israel is having 
difficult times, and it's important for the Jewish community to demonstrate 
unity." 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining support and strong ties with Israel were the topics of Cuomo's 
speech to about 1,800 people in the hotel's ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Israel Under Fire 
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere," Cuomo said, "do we see the idea of commonality demonstrated more 
inspiringly than in the ties that bind Jews everywhere, in the United States in 
particular, to Israel. . . . Israel is threatened now in an even more 
fundamental way, as you know. And it is time for her friends to speak. . . . 
Now is clearly not a time for silence, because silence at this moment would 
make a wrong statement. . . . America has always and does today call herself 
Israel's strongest friend. That being true, and I believe it is, it is then 
time for America to make itself heard in support of Israel more clearly than 
ever before." 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo added: "It has never been easy to be a friend of Israel -- her enemies 
have seen to that. But it has always been, if not easy, then right for us as 
Americans. We've understood from the beginning that our obligation to the 
Israelis is based not on the shifting sands of geopolitical strategy, nor on a 
need to make shallow propaganda, but on the hard rock of moral obligation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reliable Ally in Middle East 
</P>
<P>
He also listed pragmatic reasons to continue support: "Israel remains the only 
reliable friend and ally of the United States and the democratic nations of the 
Western region of inescapable concern to us. . . . It is vital to our 
self-interest as a nation that we keep her strong -- for our sake, for our 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo emphasized that while America should back Israel, "We need to be very 
clear that whatever solution is possible must come from the Israelis, who as a 
democracy have earned and deserve every right to speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Applauding the governor were George Caplan, president of the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles; William Belzberg, North American chairman of 
the State of Israel Bonds; Herbert Gelfand, general chairman of the United 
Jewish Fund and L.A. County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo, who was given a standing ovation for his speech, made an impression on 
some before that. Said one woman after meeting him at a cocktail reception, "He 
should've run for President. He would've gotten my vote." 
</P>
<P>
The money raised at the event, an estimated $1 million, will go to State of 
Israel Bonds and the United Jewish Fund.

<P>
Cal/OSHA resumed operations for the first time since July 1, 1987, when it 
closed down after Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed its funding. At that time, the 
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration assumed responsibility 
for protecting California's 9.5 million private-sector workers. Last November, 
California voters passed an initiative to restore the state agency. The next 
five months will be a transition period, during which federal officials will 
retain some jurisdiction, while the state agency becomes fully staffed and 
changes some of its regulations to bring them into conformity with federal 
safety standards that were enacted during the last two years.

NEW ARTS ENDOWMENT USING OLD FUNDING PLAN -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first funds from the new Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts are being 
awarded under old guidelines of the city's cultural affairs department, 
scotching an anticipated city council vote on new guidelines that some local 
arts activists had spent months gearing up for. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the (new) guidelines aren't done yet, so we've got to do the 
next best thing, to use existing processes," Al Nodal, general manager of the 
cultural affairs department, said in a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment, which could generate $20 million annually, will not be fully 
operational before July, 1990, and much of its budget -- about $15 million 
expected from fees on municipal and private development -- probably won't be 
available until fall at the earliest, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But $5.8 million from the city's general fund is already available, and 
cultural affairs department officials at one time had planned to deliver an 
interim spending plan for it to the Los Angeles City Council by July. 
</P>
<P>
But because a "needs assessment" study yet to be undertaken by the city to help 
determine the interim plan probably won't be finished until January, cultural 
affairs department officials have opted to use existing department guidelines 
to determine recipients of the $5.8 million, making a July vote by the council 
unnecessary, Nodal explained. 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing guidelines, 165 arts organizations that have applied for 
funds since last year will be awarded a total of $3 million in grants by July 
1, he said, and in January, during the next grant round, the remainder of the 
$5.8 million will probably be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Since February, hundreds in the city's arts community, organized into an 
advocacy group called the Los Angeles Arts Congress, have held several meetings 
to voice their needs for endowment funds and were encouraged by some city 
council members and the cultural affairs department to show up at City Hall for 
the interim plan vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told over and over to prepare for a big show of support," and that the 
community's funding needs would help shape the interim plan, said Susan 
Franklin Tanner, a theater producer and congress planning committee member. 
</P>
<P>
In a small meeting with congress planning committee members last weekend, Nodal 
explained how red tape has delayed the needs assessment study. The process of 
hiring a firm to conduct the study has gone "slower than we thought," he said. 
But the arts community's funding needs are not being ignored, he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole focus of the endowment is the participation of the arts community," 
Nodal said, stressing that the needs voiced at congress meetings, many of which 
he attended, are being considered as officials determine this year's grant 
winners and will influence decisions for January's recipients too, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An endowment advisory committee, made up of more than 100 people, including 
artists from every discipline, ethnic background and area of Los Angeles, will 
soon be appointed, he added, and a monthly newsletter, possibly noting future 
council votes and other endowment business, should debut June 1. 
</P>
<P>
Though some congress members were disappointed by the July vote cancellation, 
committee members at Saturday's meeting seemed to react favorably to Nodal's 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"People are in such a hurry to get this money," said Rabia, a poet, "but if 
(the endowment is not developed) with a real structure, the whole thing will 
tumble down. I feel good knowing that (city officials) are building the 
structure." 
</P>
<P>
Nodal said that a show of arts community support will be needed in September, 
when the council is expected to vote on the largest single source of endowment 
funds, a permanent ordinance requiring a 1% fee on all non-residential private 
development projects over $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The fee, which could generate up to $10 million annually, is now held in place 
by a temporary ordinance, and Nodal and other observers believe that the 
development industry may oppose it.

BATTLE FOR SPACE, LIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH-RISES CAST SHADOW OVER N.Y.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Laura Benson moved into her ninth-floor apartment on West 57th Street, it 
was a light and airy retreat from the pressures of teeming Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, her building is a dwarf in the shadows of the 
steel-and-glass towers that surround it, and Benson's once-pleasant home seems 
more and more like a cave. She can't even read during the daytime without 
turning on her lights. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fun to be in the apartment," Benson complained. "I go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
If Los Angeles' struggles with growth are defined by its clogged freeways and 
choking smog, Manhattan's are most evident in its dwindling patches of sunshine 
and open space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explosive Growth 
</P>
<P>
New York's strong recovery from its fiscal crisis of the 1970s, combined with 
the explosive growth of the financial services industry, has sent Manhattan 
into one of its most prolonged building booms ever. Demand has driven land 
prices to astronomical levels. Developers have nowhere to go but up: There are 
more than 60 buildings of taller than 15 stories under construction in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Air and light are scarcer than ever, and these days, a host of sophisticated 
and well-organized neighborhood groups are fighting to save what remains. Such 
luminaries as actor Paul Newman, violinist Itzhak Perlman and former First Lady 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis have lent their names to the efforts to stop or slow 
various projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe 20 years ago, New Yorkers would say, the bigger, the better, because 
that's what distinguishes us," said state Sen. Franz S. Leichter. "Now, there's 
concern for quality of life, and a realization that bigness isn't necessarily 
goodness. . . . Throughout the city, you are finding a revolt against 
developments that do not harmonize with the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beginning of Tragedy' 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone sees it that way. George Sternlieb, head of Rutgers University's 
Center for Urban Policy Research, described the growing influence of 
development opponents as "the beginning of a tragedy. . . . It is a desperate 
rear-guard action against the city of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can remember the bad times, when New York and New Jersey were competing 
to see which would have the highest unemployment rate," Sternlieb said. "When 
we were scared, anybody who wanted to do anything short of a toxic waste 
disposal site was welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, "there are literally a thousand groups that have the power to 
naysay." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, such organizations have won two important skirmishes in their 
escalating war with developers. 
</P>
<P>
In late March, Albert and Laurence Ginsberg were ordered to decapitate more 
than one-third of their new 31-story Upper East Side apartment building after a 
neighborhood group, Civitas, discovered they had built it taller than the law 
allows. It was the first time such a dramatic penalty had been levied by the 
city, and will mean the loss of 24 apartments that would have sold for about 
$450,000 each, or a total of $11 million. Demolition and related expenses are 
expected to cost $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Ginsbergs are appealing the Board of Standards and Appeals ruling in court. 
Meanwhile, the nearly complete building sits empty, as it has since early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mortimer B. Zuckerman finally reached an agreement with 
neighborhood groups over the skyscraper he plans to build on Columbus Circle. 
During his four-year battle, he was forced to scale down his plans twice in the 
face of public outcry. At one point, thousands gathered in Central Park with 
umbrellas to demonstrate how much sunlight the building would block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fight Over Trump City 
</P>
<P>
Those fights could pale in comparison to what may await Donald Trump, who 
expects to apply within the next few months for city permission to build his 
colossal Trump City on the Hudson River between 59th and 72nd streets. The site 
of an old Conrail yard, it is Manhattan's largest remaining undeveloped tract. 
</P>
<P>
The showpiece of Trump's 18-million-square-foot development would be the 
world's tallest building -- a 152-story tower of offices, hotel rooms and 
apartments rising a third of a mile from the Hudson's bank. Alongside it would 
be a row of 60-story buildings and the city's largest shopping mall. Its daily 
population of workers, residents and visitors would be around 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Trump insists that the development would not be another concrete wasteland. It 
would include 19 acres of parks and public recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to build a project there that is suitable for the site -- suitably 
grand," said Anthony Gliedman, executive vice president of the Trump 
Organization. "We're committed to doing a really great project there." 
</P>
<P>
Westpride, a 3-year-old community group, does not share Trump's enthusiasm or 
his taste. Trump is "the Liberace of development," said Roberta Brandes Gratz, 
one of Westpride's founders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bizarre. It is the size of a whole new city grafted onto what is already 
one of the densest neighborhoods of New York. It's just idiocy," said Gratz, 
who is the author of a recently published book, "The Living City." 
</P>
<P>
"The future of the West Side is being cemented into place for generations, and 
it is a future that has an appalling lack of concern for human scale, human 
values, for a sense of community," added author Robert A. Caro, a West Side 
resident who chronicled the development of modern New York in his Pulitzer 
Prize-winning biography of legendary city planner Robert Moses. 
</P>
<P>
Westpride has estimated that Trump's tallest building would cast a shadow a 
quarter of a mile into New Jersey in the early morning and almost all the way 
across Manhattan on some spring afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
"New York is a city of tall buildings. Clearly, there's nothing particularly 
damaged by (Trump City)," Gliedman replied. "Who would know if it cast a shadow 
to New Jersey? Who would care?" He insisted that the spire would be less 
intrusive to the air and light than the bulky developments of earlier eras, 
such as Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, tall buildings are nothing new to Manhattan. As far back as 1930, 
folk singer Woody Guthrie described it as a place where "the buildings are so 
high the sun don't come out until 1:30 in the afternoon, and then it's visible 
for seven minutes between the Empire State Building and the shoeshine over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backlash Growing 
</P>
<P>
But today's projects, said Sen. Leichter, "are not just big. They're grandiose. 
It's like a game of, 'I Can Top You.' . . . There's a real backlash growing." 
</P>
<P>
Developers claim that in this confrontational climate, it has become harder to 
win approval for a project than it is to actually build it. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Eichner, whose 72-story Cityspire on West 55th Street has been one of the 
more controversial towers to pierce the Manhattan sky in the last few years, 
describes the trend as "the Tokyoization of Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
Few cities in the world restrict development so tightly as land-scarce Tokyo, 
where "sunshine right" is protected as a vested interest in the building code 
and even one dissenting vote in a neighborhood can tie up construction for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verges on Mystical 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Eichner's opponents argue that New York's old zoning 
strictures have crumbled in the era of super-scale developers. Today's giant 
skyscrapers materialize through a process that verges on the mystical. 
</P>
<P>
Eichner's Cityspire is a good example. He was able to build it almost twice as 
big as zoning would otherwise permit by: 
</P>
<P>
* Literally buying air from his neighbor at $32.50 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
* Taking advantage of a controversial city bonus plan. 
</P>
<P>
* And, finally, striking a bargain with city officials when he discovered he 
had accidentally built Cityspire too tall. 
</P>
<P>
His first step was to buy his neighbor's "air rights" -- the vacant space over 
a nearby building. Its owners literally subdivided the air and transferred the 
right to develop it to Eichner. 
</P>
<P>
Stacking such columns of air, a concept that has been used to a lesser extent 
in Los Angeles, is the chief means by which developers have gotten permission 
to build the spires that have elevated the Manhattan skyline in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Makes for Variety 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the concept note that transferring air rights makes for variety, 
far more attractive than developing areas into monotonous and forbidding blocks 
of buildings that are all the same size. Once they've sold their air rights, 
the buildings around a skyscraper are forced to remain small. 
</P>
<P>
But community groups often complain that such dealing can destroy the character 
of a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Another controversial policy has been the city's practice of relaxing its 
zoning code in exchange for builders' providing services and amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Even after he acquired his neighbor's air rights, Eichner could not construct 
Cityspire as big as he wanted it. So he took advantage of a city bonus plan, 
under which he could add 20% to the size of the building, if he gave the city 
something it wanted in return. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, developers have received bonuses for adding atriums or plazas; 
in others, for providing middle- or low-income housing. Sometimes bonuses are 
used to channel construction from densely developed areas to those where growth 
is considered desirable. 
</P>
<P>
Eichner won his bonus by renovating the rundown City Center Theater near the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
But his story did not end there. As Cityspire was nearing completion, Eichner 
discovered he had inadvertently built it 11 feet too tall. So he went back into 
protracted negotiations with the city, and agreed earlier this year to donate 
rehearsal space for nonprofit dance companies in return for the right to keep 
the extra height. 
</P>
<P>
Eichner said the whole process has been a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between the building being 800 feet and 811 feet is of no 
consequence to anyone," he complained. "I cannot for the life of me understand 
what public good was served by this fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
However, New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote that the 
Cityspire saga symbolized a disturbing trend. 
</P>
<P>
Such dealings, he wrote, "turn the natural order of things upside down, and 
suggest that private developers can make their own rules, or at least negotiate 
with the city to revise the rules if they are not happy with them. . . . What 
is to prevent another developer from adding 22 feet to his building and 
offering to build two dance studios?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Ginsbergs, who are facing the prospect of having to demolish the 
top 12 floors of their apartment building on East 96th Street, tried to make a 
similar deal. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that they broke the law through no fault of their own -- they said they 
relied on a faulty city zoning map -- the developers offered to refurbish 
nearby tenements if they could keep the additional stories. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Mayor Edward I. Koch supported their proposal, but he has since 
reversed his position and supports the Board of Standards and Appeals decision. 
</P>
<P>
To Civitas, the group that alerted the city to the violation in July, 1986, the 
board's ruling is an important precedent. Too long, said Civitas president 
Genie Rice, the message to developers has been that if "you break the law, you 
pay your way out. That is part of doing business in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Mayoral candidate and City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin agreed: "The city 
should stop selling municipal indulgences." 
</P>
<P>
Con Howe, executive director of the City Planning Commission, rejected the 
contention that the city has been cutting too many deals with developers. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said that the city has removed many of the bonuses it used to offer -- 
such as allowing bigger buildings in exchange for theater renovations, atriums 
and arcades. In recent years, he said, it has added only one new type of bonus 
-- for developers who include low- and moderate-income housing in their 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, we've moved to 'as-of-right' development. That's the term we use 
where there's no special permission requested or granted," Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that between 1978 and 1982, only 39% of the buildings in mid-town were 
built without special approval, bonuses or variances. In the next five years, 
the most recent for which figures are available, 80% of mid-town construction 
has "followed the letter of the zoning laws." 
</P>
<P>
But in the eyes of its critics, the city has been too eager a partner with 
developers, sacrificing rational urban planning for the sake of expanding its 
tax base and stretching its revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Said Elliott Sclar, a Columbia University urban planning professor: "The only 
thing Mayor Koch had left to sell was the light and the air of Manhattan, so he 
began selling it with a vengeance." 
</P>

GLOBE-TROTTING IN ASIA, QUAYLE A 'HAPPY CAMPER'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard M. Nixon's foreign travels as vice president are remembered mostly for 
his "kitchen debate" with Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev on the comparative 
merits of communism and capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
When George Bush was vice president, he was the official funeral-goer, 
traveling overseas regularly to attend the last rites of such foreign 
dignitaries as Soviet leaders Leonid I. Brezhnev and Konstantin U. Chernenko. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Dan Quayle is putting his personal imprint on the institution of vice 
presidential globe-trotting during a four-nation, 27,000-mile swing through 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, it appears, will be exporting the eternal values of American boyhood: 
cheery optimism, a dislike for routine and detail and a consuming passion for 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
On the very first stop of his trip across the Pacific, a two-hour refueling at 
Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, Quayle donned a sleeveless black T-shirt and 
pale yellow gym shorts for a 3 a.m. game of basketball. The vice president, 42, 
demonstrated an ability to make a jump shot from the foul line. A few hours 
later, at another refueling stop, in American Samoa, Quayle looked out at an 
airport crowd of about 2,000 schoolchildren and uttered his most memorable line 
of the trip so far: 
</P>
<P>
"You all look like happy campers. Happy campers you are, happy campers you have 
been and happy campers you will always be." 
</P>
<P>
To his own considerable delight, Quayle then declared it a school holiday in 
American Samoa. The Samoan children cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, during five days in Australia and a day in Indonesia, Quayle has 
met with a series of foreign leaders and been guest of honor at two black-tie 
dinners. He has jogged, played tennis and golf and gone scuba diving and pub 
crawling. 
</P>
<P>
He has made no weighty foreign policy pronouncements. On the other hand, he has 
made no major errors, at least nothing so lasting or damaging as, for example, 
Bush's 1981 vice presidential visit to Manila, when he told Philippine 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos that "we love your adherence to democratic 
principles." Political opponents of Marcos were infuriated. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Quayle's only gaffes have been inconsequential. He has trouble with 
names and places. Arriving in Australia at the end of his tiring journey across 
the Pacific, he referred to Pago Pago as "Pogo Pogo." 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming vice president, Quayle had been to Asia only once: As a member 
of the House of Representatives, in the late 1970s, he took part in a 
parliamentary exchange program with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
This is his second trip abroad as vice president. The first was a three-day 
visit to Venezuela and El Salvador in February. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle seems to chafe at the lack of spontaneity in an organized vice 
presidential trip abroad and to yearn for free time to enjoy himself as a 
private citizen would. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, on Sunday, the final day of his five-day visit to Australia, Quayle 
and his wife, Marilyn, spent most of the day scuba diving on the Great Barrier 
Reef -- then delayed their departure for Indonesia so that they could get in a 
last quick round of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the luxury resort hotel where Quayle and his party were staying, 
the Sheraton Mirage in Port Douglas, were so annoyed at the Quayles' change in 
plans that they tried to add on an extra night's room charge -- $200 a person 
-- for late checkout. This would have cost the U.S. government an extra $3,000 
just for the 15 Secret Service agents in the party. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle spokesman David Beckwith reported later that after protests from 
Quayle's staff, the hotel agreed to drop the extra fees. 
</P>
<P>
This spontaneity and Quayle's photogeneity and youthful good cheer often win 
him friends. In Sydney last Friday, to the astonishment of Australian security 
officials, Quayle said in the middle of the afternoon that he wanted to visit a 
pub. After quick consultation, Sydney officials took him to a pub called the 
Lord Nelson, where, beer in hand, Quayle made the rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell your friends you met me," he said to Ann Larsen, 25, an IBM administrator 
who was sitting at a table with a girlfriend. "They won't believe you. They'll 
say you've been down at the Lord Nelson too long." 
</P>
<P>
"He's much younger than I expected," Larsen told reporters later. " . . . He's 
so cute." 
</P>
<P>
In press conferences, Quayle has demonstrated a tendency to deflect questions 
with genial humor in a way that is reminiscent of former President Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In Canberra, Australia, a New Zealand reporter asked Quayle why he was not 
visiting her country while he was in the South Pacific. The United States is 
bitterly opposed to New Zealand's anti-nuclear policies, but Quayle avoided the 
foreign policy dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Alaska, Washington, 
D.C.," he told the reporter. "I came from Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, 
Hawaii, American Samoa, Australia. It is a good trip. I'm having fun. And I 
intend to have more fun." The Australian audience laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on his foreign travels, Quayle has demonstrated some other Reaganesque 
qualities, as if he, more than President Bush, were the true heir to Reagan's 
political style. Like the former President, Quayle conveys a sense of wealth 
and optimism. And, as was the case with Reagan, Quayle's reputation for 
simplicity and lack of intellect can sometimes be as much an asset as a 
liability. Because Quayle is so genial and self-deprecating, audiences seem to 
make allowances for his slips of the tongue and non sequiturs. 
</P>
<P>
Also like the former President, Quayle has a strong-willed wife. During the 
past week, Marilyn Quayle has exhibited a disdain, bordering on abhorrence, for 
the press coverage she attracts and the public duties she is asked to perform 
as the vice president's wife. 
</P>
<P>
She avoided speaking to or even looking at the 10 reporters on Air Force 2 for 
the first three days of the trip. Finally, one day she walked to the press 
section of the plane and said, "My husband said I had to come back, that you 
had been complaining." Then, after talking with the reporters for less than 
five minutes, she turned around and walked off. "I've done my duty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At an elementary school in Melbourne, Mrs. Quayle told a group of Australian 
children: "In my original job, I'm a lawyer. But since my husband became vice 
president, I have a lot of duties to perform for him. So I'm not sure I can 
practice law, although I'd like to." 
</P>
<P>
One student asked Mrs. Quayle whether she had ever thought she would be the 
wife of the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she replied. "That was not on my agenda."

MAJOR EXPANSION OF MAGNET SCHOOL PROGRAM OKD IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to pressure to provide more magnet schools, particularly in minority 
neighborhoods, the Los Angeles Board of Education on Monday approved a major 
expansion of the district's prized network of specialized learning centers that 
many parents believe are superior to regular schools. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 6-0 to add 32 new magnet programs to the current 87 over the 
next two years, beginning with eight this fall. The largest single expansion of 
the magnet network since 1982, the new programs could provide space for an 
estimated 6,500 students. Currently, about 27,000 of the district's 595,000 
students attend magnet programs. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they recommended expanding the magnet programs because 
of the huge demand from parents and because of criticism that not enough of the 
specialized programs were located in predominantly minority neighborhoods. 
Magnet schools are heavily concentrated in middle-class, largely Anglo areas of 
the Westside, the West San Fernando Valley and the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"The ethnic pattern of those seats (in magnet programs) tells a story of 
institutional racism," said board member Leticia Quezada. If poor children 
"wanted access to an enriched curriculum, they had to travel to other 
neighborhoods, while other children were told that they could have that 
enriched curriculum in their own neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Magnet schools focus on specific academic areas -- such as science or the arts 
-- or on special teaching methods. There are also magnet schools that are only 
for gifted students. Students in most magnet programs score higher on state and 
district standardized tests than students in regular schools, but there are 
long waiting lists to get into the classes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Response to Desegregation Suit 
</P>
<P>
The magnet programs originated as a response to a desegregation lawsuit against 
the district, with the first schools established in the early 1970s to 
encourage voluntary integration. Any district student may apply, but priority 
for admission is determined on the basis of several factors, including 
ethnicity and whether a student's neighborhood school is crowded or racially 
unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
The programs have been controversial, however, with some critics contending 
that they are elitist and deprive other schools of badly needed resources. In 
addition, as an integration tool the programs have achieved only moderate 
success, with most inner-city magnets enrolling 10% or less Anglo students. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment at most district magnet programs is based on a 60/40 ethnic ratio 
guideline in which neither Anglos nor minorities should hold more than 60% of 
the places. However, the ethnic ratio at the 32 new programs will allow 
enrollment of up to 70% Anglos or minorities depending on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the expansion will provide spaces for 1,624 students this 
fall and as many as 4,900 additional openings in 1990. But the demand for 
magnet schools continues to exceed the supply, even with the expansion. The 
waiting list this year alone has ranged between 10,000 and 19,000 students, 
according to Richard Battaglia, an adviser in the district's magnet office. 
</P>
<P>
It will cost $4.7 million to open the first eight new magnet schools, according 
to district figures. About $3.4 million will be paid by the state under a 
program to reimburse districts for voluntary integration efforts. District 
funds will cover the remaining costs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the eight new magnet programs scheduled to open this September are 
programs for gifted students at Euclid Elementary in East Los Angeles, at North 
Hollywood High School, and at Adams Junior High and Crenshaw High in 
South-Central Los Angeles. Programs emphasizing math and science will be 
established at Teresa Hughes Elementary in South-Central Los Angeles, South 
Gate Elementary in South Gate and Windsor Hills Elementary in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At Allesandro Elementary in Northeast Los Angeles, the district plans a program 
based on a teaching method called cooperative learning, in which students work 
in teams to solve problems and master basic concepts. An increasingly popular 
teaching technique nationally, cooperative learning already is practiced by 
many Los Angeles teachers, an official said. Proponents of the approach say it 
helps build students' confidence and self-esteem and reduce conflicts because 
it teaches students to work together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW MAGNET SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education on Monday approved a two-stage expansion of 
the district's magnet school program. Eight new magnets will open in September 
and 24 others in September, 1990, according to the plan. Below are the schools 
and their locations. Stage I programs include the school's specialized 
curriculum. Areas of emphasis for Stage II programs will be determined later.

JAPANESE BUY HOTEL BEL-AIR FOR $100 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN and ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legendary Hotel Bel-Air, a bougainvillea-bordered haven for show business 
celebrities and European royalty seeking privacy and elegance, is being sold to 
a Japanese investment group for more than $100 million, the hotel's current 
owners announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The per-room purchase price of more than $1.2 million shatters the old record 
of about $757,000 per room, established when the Sultan of Brunei bought the 
nearby 260-room Beverly Hills Hotel for about $200 million in 1987. Investor 
Donald Trump paid $496,000 a room when he bought New York's Plaza Hotel last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of a Trend 
</P>
<P>
With the sale of the Bel-Air, the three most famous hotels on Los Angeles' 
Westside are now under foreign or multinational ownership. The Beverly Wilshire 
Hotel was purchased in 1985 by Hong Kong-based Regent International Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Farmer, a spokeswoman for Rosewood Property Co. of Dallas, which 
purchased the 11-acre Bel-Air Hotel property in the exclusive Stone Canyon 
residential neighborhood near UCLA in 1982 for $22.1 million, said the sale 
should be completed later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The purchaser, Sekitei Kaihatsu, is a 95-year-old firm based in Tokyo that 
operates eight luxury resort hotels in Japan, Rosewood president Atef Mankarios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood, part of the Caroline Rose Hunt Trust estate, formed by the oil 
heiress often described as one of the world's wealthiest women, will continue 
to operate the 92-room hotel for the Japanese investors. The company has 
already spent more than $20 million renovating and adding rooms to the Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Mankarios said the Bel-Air sale will have no impact on the hotel's operations. 
"It's still an American hotel, run by an American company in an American 
style," he contended. 
</P>
<P>
Mankarios said Sekitei beat out about 50 other prospective buyers, not just on 
the basis of price, but also because its management philosophy was most 
compatible with Rosewood's. He would not name the other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Rosewood, Sekitei president Kimio Haneda said the 
purchase of the hotel "is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. . . . It is 
important to us that Rosewood continues to manage this property with the same 
exacting standards of excellence which have made Hotel Bel-Air so exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach officials of Morgan Stanley Realty, who represented Rosewood 
in negotiating the sale, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The rambling Mission-style complex of bungalows and larger buildings was 
allowed amid the mansions and estates of Stone Canyon because several of the 
original structures had served as business offices and stables for the original 
1920s Bel-Air subdivision. Since these structures failed to conform to local 
residential zoning codes anyway, their transformation into a luxury hotel in 
the 1940s met with little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The pink stucco Bel-Air has been described by Travel and Leisure Magazine as 
one of the "10 great hotels in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has an average occupancy rate of 90%, one of the highest in the Los 
Angeles area, Farmer said. Room rates start at about $195 per night, with the 
most expensive two-room suite priced at $1,300 a night, said manager Paul 
Zuest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famous for Weddings 
</P>
<P>
He said as many as five couples get married each weekend alongside the famous 
pond where eight swans are in residence. Among the hotel's 300 employees are 12 
full-time landscapers. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotel has sort of an understated elegance," Farmer said. "That's why so 
many celebrities flock there. Because it's not a showplace, they can be left 
alone there." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Zuest put it, when turning down a request to interview patrons: "We sell 
privacy." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, for example, Zuest nervously whisked reporters through the hotel 
terrace, where former First Lady Nancy Reagan was seen lunching with publishers 
of her forthcoming book. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly, Bette Davis and 
Audrey Hepburn lived in the hotel for months at a time while under contract to 
movie studios, said concierge Phil Landon Jr., a 40-year employee of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, for one, felt so much at home there that the morning after she won an 
Oscar for "Country Girl," she excitedly brought it over to Landon's desk. "She 
was just like a little girl," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, guests have included such celebrities as Don Johnson, Dudley 
Moore, Angela Lansbury, Mick Jagger, Boy George and Dolly Parton, Landon said. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the hotel had a reputation as a high-class trysting spot, since 
every room is accessible through walkways and there is no need for visitors to 
pass through the small lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"We have guests here we've never seen," Landon said. "Their man comes in (the 
lobby) and takes the key, and that's all we ever see of them." 
</P>
<P>
One longtime resident has been actor Tony Curtis, who lovingly described the 
hotel as "the best wife he'd ever had." 
</P>
<P>
"If I could, I would marry the Bel-Air tomorrow," he told an interviewer in 
1987. "She doesn't ask me where I've been all night. She doesn't mind if I 
bring a girl home. She makes my bed every day, feeds me regularly, takes my 
messages faithfully and puts my laundry in those little boxes tied up with 
ribbon."

JEAN TAYLOR RETIRES AS TIMES ASSOCIATE EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Sharley Taylor, who as associate editor of The Times directed the paper's 
features sections for the last 14 years, retired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor came to The Times in 1971 as women's editor and later edited the View 
section. Named associate editor in 1975, she presided over the creation of a 
number of sections, including daily Calendar, the Book Review and the Los 
Angeles Times Magazine. During that period, The Times won three Pulitzer Prizes 
for arts coverage. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, Taylor has been the moving force behind the creation of 
The Times' computerized reading lab and a member of the literacy committee of 
the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>
<P>
She is the recipient of numerous awards, including the 1988 Women Behind the 
News Award from Women in Communications and the Penney-Missouri Award for 
features editing. She also has been a Pulitzer Prize juror and member of the 
Southwest Committee of the Rhodes Scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Los Angeles, Taylor was associate editor of the Arizona 
Republic and also had worked as a reporter for the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
At a retirement reception last week, Editor and Executive Vice President Shelby 
Coffey III cited the growth of the paper's features sections under Taylor and 
described her as "a leader and a lover of all that's best in newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Until a replacement is named, the feature departments will report to Assistant 
Managing Editor John Brownell, Coffey said.

DAVIS, PROTECTING HIS 'OPTIONS,' FILES FOR REELECTION AS CONTROLLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a persistent belief that the Democratic race for governor is wide open 
and languishing for lack of pizazz, one of its most highly charged contenders 
is pulling back. Gray Davis, after quietly exploring a gubernatorial candidacy 
for some months, has now filed for reelection as state controller. 
</P>
<P>
Davis insisted he is not pulling out of the 1990 governor's race for certain. 
He said he acted only to protect his "options." But Davis' willingness to 
plunge wholeheartedly into the governor's race has been questioned for months, 
and this latest move is likely to fuel doubts whether the ambitious state 
controller will be a factor as the campaign unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
That would leave Democrats with former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and 
state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp -- and with the uneasy feeling that things 
are not going well for them in these early but important formulative campaign 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic race for governor is dead in the water. It's a consensus among 
a great many people but is just not being voiced. I think it's now time to 
voice it. . . . And it's time to jump-start it," said Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica). "I don't want to sound negative, but I mean we have to work 
on this." 
</P>
<P>
The foreboding frequently voiced by Democrats is that Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Pete Wilson, California's junior U.S. senator, has taken command of 
the contest to replace two-term Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. Democrats 
see Wilson suddenly framing the issues and claiming the high ground almost 
without challenge. At the same time, Democrats worry that none of their 
candidates has spelled out a platform for the 1990 elections, none has seized 
and become identified with a popular issue and none has emerged with a 
"winning" image. 
</P>
<P>
"We Democrats are allowing Wilson to look like a governor. We should be up 
there talking about change. We should be the party of change," said Democratic 
campaign strategist Kam Kuwata, who has been advising Davis. "So far, all we 
look like is the party of lost opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has lagged in those occasional public opinion polls that have been 
published about this campaign. But he brought to his exploratory campaign 
superlative fund-raising skills, media savvy and the potential for derring-do. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis, although active on the pro-choice front of the abortion issue and 
elsewhere, has failed to crack what he calls "this name ID thing." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he has formed his new reelection committee, Davis will not shut 
down his gubernatorial campaign exploratory committee. He said Monday that he 
had not formulated plans on how he would approach supporters from now on. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Van de Kamp has had only one committee all along -- the one 
raising money for his gubernatorial campaign. But there seem to be increasing 
numbers of Democrats who are critical of the efforts so far by this 
Establishment favorite. "There is the widespread feeling that John should be 
doing better," said one party activist. 
</P>
<P>
Several incidents are listed by the nay-sayers: Van de Kamp made a splashy 
attempt to exert leadership in the campaign to slap controls on the sale and 
possession of assault weapons. But as the debate developed, his role seemed 
stretched and not particularly crucial to the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Then came his highly publicized admission of error in his handling of the 
Hillside Strangler prosecution. In this sensational and long-running case eight 
years ago, Van de Kamp, at the time Los Angeles County district attorney, 
wanted to dismiss murder charges against defendant Angelo Buono Jr. and 
prosecute him for sex crimes. A judge overruled him and state officials 
ultimately obtained murder convictions. 
</P>
<P>
For a candidate who is also anti-death penalty, this admission of error struck 
some as showing vulnerability just where Van de Kamp was supposed to be 
stronger than other Democrats, on the law-and-order issue. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Van de Kamp has failed thus far in his hope of clearing out the field 
of Democratic challengers. In fact, some Democrats, even those with a basic 
inclination to support Van de Kamp, wonder why the attorney general has been 
unable thus far to capitalize on his standing among party brass and take the 
lead in public opinion samplings. So far, through, Feinstein has held an edge 
in the early samplings. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp backers argue that complainers fail to appreciate the value of the 
ground work now being laid down for the real battles to come. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we raising money? Yes. Are we on schedule? Yes. Have we put together a 
team of well respected professionals? Yes. Are we taking our own (poll) 
samplings? Yes. Are they encouraging? Yes," said campaign manager Richie Ross. 
"The inside baseball players would only be happy if you have blown $2 million 
now. And we're not going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, growing concern among Democrats that the would-be governors 
are falling behind Wilson not only in the polls but also in spelling out the 
visions that drive them -- the themes and hopes and dreams that might inspire 
and sway voters. 
</P>
<P>
In a couple of key speeches, Wilson has separated himself from Deukmejian in 
support of new highway taxes, for an activist approach to health care and 
environmental protection, among other things. Even critics give him credit for 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not it's true, there is a perception of Wilson's strength that 
carries with it a self-fulfilling prophesy. If he is thought of as strong, he 
will be strong. And that is the way he is projecting now," said one leading 
Democratic campaign strategist. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp Democrats say they are getting ready to fire back. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next 60 to 90 days you will see -- we're going to be real clear that 
we're setting the pace and taking command," said campaign manager Ross. "When 
he begins to make his statements, he will be thoughtful, interesting and 
offering something different from the normal kind of stuff the public has grown 
tired of." 
</P>
<P>
The Feinstein campaign is starting later, owing to the ex-mayor's early 
ambivalence about the race. Campaign consultant Clinton Reilly said he is 
unconcerned about the expressions of Democratic discontent. 
</P>
<P>
"This is typical stuff. In the early stages, many people long for the ideal 
that never materializes. First and foremost to win an election you've got to 
run. Dianne has now shown the guts to run."

COLD FUSION CLAIM IN ERROR, 2 EXPERTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
'CONVENTIONAL CHEMISTRY,' CALTECH RESEARCHER FINDS IN EVALUATING UTAH TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Caltech and MIT scientists Monday leveled serious new charges at two 
researchers' recent claims of room-temperature fusion in a flask, with the 
Caltech chemist concluding that "there is no evidence for anything other than 
conventional chemistry" in the cold fusion experiments. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech's Nathan Lewis told physicists here for a meeting of the American 
Physical Society that he had re-evaluated the available data of chemists B. 
Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of the University 
of Southampton in England and conducted his own experiments as well. His 
results indicate that the nuclear fusion first reported more than a month ago 
is the result of calculation errors made by Pons and Fleischmann and is not a 
real phenomenon, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis charged that Pons and Fleischmann specifically did not obtain more energy 
from their fusion cell than they put in -- a key component of their claims. 
Instead, he said, they made an assumption about how much heat they should be 
getting out and, when they obtained more, reported that as excess heat. In 
reality, he said, they were recovering only about 20% of the energy they were 
putting into the cell. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' presentation was loudly applauded by a crowd of about 3,000 physicists 
who seemed to agree that reports of cold fusion are illusory. His speech had 
such an impact that half of the audience left the auditorium afterward without 
waiting for other presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, MIT physicist Ronald R. Parker claimed that the Utah 
researchers' measurements of radiation emitted from their fusion cell were in 
error. 
</P>
<P>
The errors in radiation measurement, Parker said, are "a warning not to accept 
all their (Pons and Fleischmann's) claims at face value and to to expect that 
there's an overnight path to nirvana as far as energy is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The Caltech and MIT scientists are among about 15 research groups who were 
expected to report at the society meeting Monday night that they had been 
unable to reproduce Pons' and Fleischmann's results. Several other groups have 
reported in the past two weeks that they have confirmed at least some of the 
cold fusion results, but none of them is scheduled to make presentations at 
this meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann were invited to attend the meeting, but declined. 
</P>
<P>
The Utah and Southampton researchers created fusion fever a month ago when they 
reported that they had obtained more energy from a simple fusion cell than they 
had put in and that the excess energy was produced by fusion. Their cell 
involved simple palladium and platinum electrodes immersed in deuterium oxide 
-- so-called heavy water -- in which each hydrogen atom is replaced by a 
deuterium atom, which has an extra neutron. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that the deuterium ions were forced into close contact in 
the palladium electrode by an electric field, and that contact caused them to 
fuse into helium atoms, releasing large amounts of energy in the process. 
Physicists scoffed at the report, however, because they could not conceive of 
any fusion reaction that did not release large amounts of radiation in the form 
of neutrons or gamma rays. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann reported that they observed only about a billionth as many 
neutrons as would be expected to result if their excess heat had been caused by 
fusion. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and his colleagues reported about two weeks ago that they could find no 
evidence of fusion, and they reiterated that Monday. Mimicking the Utah 
apparatus as closely as they could with the limited information available, and 
using a variety of other experimental setups, Lewis said, "we found no evidence 
of neutron detection . . . and no gamma rays." 
</P>
<P>
They also found no excess heat production. Lewis noted that Fleischmann's 
calculation of the heat output was based upon a hypothetical number, as Pons 
conceded in congressional testimony last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Caltech researchers also cast doubt on some evidence the Utah researchers 
had cited in support of their conclusions. They had, for example, said that 
they had found both helium and tritium in their cell and claimed that as proof 
that fusion had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis noted that helium is present in the atmosphere of most chemical 
laboratories (because it is used in much scientific apparatus) in the same 
concentrations Pons and Fleischmann observed. In fact, he said, "the 
concentrations they observed were much higher than should have been there if it 
were produced by fusion." He also found that chemical reactions in the cell 
could make it appear that tritium is present when it is not. 
</P>
<P>
Concluded Lewis: "We have no reason to invoke fusion to explain any of their 
work." 
</P>
<P>
MIT's Parker did not make many details of his report public before the Monday 
night session. In essence, however, he found that Pons' and Fleischmann's 
report that they had observed neutrons in their experiment contained 
inconsistencies that suggested errors in measurement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asserting that their neutron emission was below what they thought it 
was, including the possibility that it could have been none at all," Parker 
said.

FBI AGENT SAYS SILBERMAN TOLD OF PAYMENT TO PROBE FIGURE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moments after his arrest on April 7 in an alleged money-laundering scheme, 
Richard T. Silberman told federal agents that he gave a reputed mobster $6,500 
in cash as compensation for introducing him to a man Silberman believed was 
connected to Colombian drug dealers, according to testimony Monday in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony by an FBI agent, which came during a probation revocation hearing 
for the alleged mobster, Chris Petti, suggests that Silberman, a powerful San 
Diego businessman and political fund-raiser, acknowledged key details about his 
reported involvement and that of Petti and two others in the money-laundering 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., interviewed after the court 
hearing, was asked if the testimony indicated that Silberman "confessed" to any 
of the charges against him and the others after he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an inference a reasonable person would make," Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment From Lawyer 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Goodman, a Las Vegas attorney who is representing Petti and is known for 
his outspoken criticism of federal prosecutors, was unusually close-mouthed 
after the Monday court session. He refused to comment on whether Silberman may 
have confessed to some of the allegations in the indictment against him and the 
other three defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say anything about it," Goodman said, leaving the courtroom 
and heading straight for the elevators. "And this is big-mouth Goodman saying 
that." 
</P>
<P>
In other court action Monday, James J. Brosnahan, a prominent San Francisco 
attorney, was presented as Silberman's attorney in the money-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan, 55, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Kennedy and Johnson 
administrations, joined several others in 1986 in testifying against the 
confirmation of Justice William H. Rehnquist as chief justice of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and Petti are charged with conspiring to launder $300,000 they 
allegedly believed came from Colombian drug traffickers. The money actually 
came from an undercover FBI agent posing as a middleman. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged in the complex case are Darryl Nakatsuka of Los Angeles, described 
as a "bag man" in the money-laundering operation, and Jack N. Myers of Malibu, 
who has been associated with Silberman since the days when both raised campaign 
funds for former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
All four defendants have pleaded not guilty in the case and all but Petti are 
free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing on Monday centered on whether Petti, who remains in the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center, has violated terms of his probation on an 
earlier bookmaking conviction by not reporting to authorities that he received 
the $6,500 from Silberman during the alleged money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
But Goodman said that any money Petti may have received from Silberman was 
later given to Robert Benjamin, a longtime associate of Petti's who turned 
government informant to help the FBI in its 2 1/2-year investigation of Petti. 
That investigation later ensnared Silberman and the other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The judge in the probation revocation hearing continued the matter until 
Friday, when Benjamin is scheduled to testify about the alleged transfer of 
money from Silberman to Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Charles B. Walker, the FBI agent who supervised the Petti-Silberman case, 
described from the witness stand how agents arrested Silberman at the Hyatt 
Islandia hotel while he was allegedly negotiating to launder $1.1 million that 
an undercover agent had told him were illegal drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said Silberman was taken inside Room 719 of the hotel, was told why he 
was being arrested, and advised of his Miranda rights. He said Silberman at 
that time "made a statement." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Silberman told me that he paid Chris Petti approximately $6,500 for having 
introduced him to the special (undercover) agent whom he knew as Peter 
Carmassi," Walker testified. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me the $6,500 was given to Chris Petti during a meeting at the Denny's 
restaurant. And he told me he did not give money to Mr. Benjamin because he 
told me Mr. Benjamin would be paid by Mr. Carmassi." 
</P>
<P>
On April 3, federal agents had observed a meeting at the downtown Denny's 
restaurant between Petti and Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Petti and Mr. Silberman were observed at the counter at the Denny's that 
day," Walker testified in describing the FBI surveillance of that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Silberman was observed giving a package to Mr. Petti, who put it in his 
pocket. It was a small envelope." 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that the package contained part of the money paid by 
Silberman to Petti as a fee for Petti's introducing him to the undercover 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
The government alleges that Silberman assumed all along that the undercover 
agent was a middleman trying to hide money for Colombia drug dealers.

Maoist guerrillas shot and killed three players at an amateur soccer match, 
police reported Monday, and the government announced it is prolonging an 
anti-guerrilla state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a group of Shining Path guerrillas disrupted a soccer match Sunday 
between neighboring villages in Cullpa, on Huancayo's western outskirts, and 
ordered 100 spectators and players to attend a lecture in the village square. 
The three men were shot when they refused to go along, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Extension of the state of emergency comes during the deadliest reign of 
violence so far in Peru's nine-year fight against leftist guerrillas. Nearly 
1,000 people have been killed this year, including 86 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The extension take force when the current decree expires Wednesday. It affects 
Lima and parts of seven highland and jungle states where more than half of 
Peru's 21 million people live. 
</P>
<P>
The decree suspends citizens' rights to travel and meet freely, and permits 
government forces to conduct searches without warrants and hold suspects for 15 
days without filing charges.

KHMER ROUGE MUST HAVE CAMBODIA ROLE, QUAYLE TOLD

<P>
On the eve of increasingly significant negotiations aimed at resolving the 
future of Cambodia, Vice President Dan Quayle was told Monday by Prince Norodom 
Sihanouk, the Cambodian resistance leader, that the ultra-radical Khmer Rouge 
will have to be given a role in a new Cambodian government. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, who is visiting Indonesia on a tour of Asian nations, met with Sihanouk 
and said afterward that he believes the process of reaching a settlement in the 
drawn-out Cambodia conflict is "moving along." 
</P>
<P>
"It's slow, it's complicated," he said. "There are not going to be any quick 
and easy solutions to the rather intractable problem we've had for some time." 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister of the Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodia, Hun Sen, 
arrived in Jakarta on Monday night for two days of talks with Sihanouk starting 
today. The talks are aimed at achieving a political settlement in advance of 
Vietnam's troop withdrawal from Cambodia. The Vietnamese have announced that 
they will complete the withdrawal by Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Changed Back 
</P>
<P>
In Phnom Penh, the Hun Sen government announced that the official name of the 
country, which since the Vietnamese invasion in 1978 has been known officially 
as the People's Republic of Kampuchea, had been changed back to Cambodia. The 
name was Cambodia when Sihanouk ruled, until his ouster in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The national anthem, flag and state emblem were also changed, and the 
constitution was amended by the National Assembly in an apparent effort to 
compromise with resistance demands that the Hun Sen government be dismantled. 
The changes were widely seen as bargaining chips by Hun Sen on the eve of his 
discussions with Sihanouk, the nominal leader of the three-faction resistance 
coalition fighting the Phnom Penh regime. 
</P>
<P>
According to the official Cambodian press agency SPA, Hun Sen said the changes 
were made "to lay the foundation for rallying all the nation's forces." 
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen reportedly called on Sihanouk to join his government in a coalition and 
promised him genuine power if he would agree to return to Phnom Penh. But Hun 
Sen reportedly rejected resistance demands for a four-party coalition to govern 
until free elections can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told a news conference in Phnom Penh that dismantling the government 
would "open the door for the Khmer Rouge to return to power." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's invasion in 1978 drove the Khmer Rouge government into exile in 
Thailand. While in power from 1975 until December, 1978, the Khmer Rouge 
presided over a brutal Communist dictatorship in which more than 1 million 
Cambodians died of torture, starvation and disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Solution 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which refused to recognize the Vietnamese-installed 
government, has called for a solution that excludes the Khmer Rouge from 
dominating any future Cambodian government. Many Western diplomats feel that 
the Khmer Rouge will refuse to take part in a coalition and will use the 
transition to seize power again. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official traveling with Quayle told reporters that the 
vice president had expressed support for Sihanouk as the leader of a coalition 
government in Cambodia and asked about ways to increase the leverage of the 
non-Communist factions in the resistance coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, describing Sihanouk as "a unique figure in world history," told 
reporters: "We support him, the Soviets support him and the Chinese support him 
as being the leader of a coalition government in Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration official said Sihanouk, whom he described as "cautiously 
optimistic" about the talks with Hun Sen, had discussed the possibility of 
including the Khmer Rouge in the government. He quoted Sihanouk as saying that 
Khmer Rouge participation is essential unless China can be persuaded to abandon 
its support of the radical faction. 
</P>
<P>
The official later suggested that Hun Sen may be ready to propose to Sihanouk 
the creation of a four-party supreme council as a face-saving compromise to 
answer the resistance demand for dismantling the present Phnom Penh government. 
</P>
<P>
"The key question at this meeting is whether Hun Sen dismantles his government 
when he sets up this supreme council or whether that council and the Hun Sen 
government will exist side by side," the Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
The remark appeared to confirm that major new proposals about the future of 
Cambodia are expected to be broached at the Jakarta conference in an effort to 
avoid civil war when Vietnam's estimated 70,000 remaining troops leave 
Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's government has about 30,000 full-time soldiers and a militia of 
100,000 arrayed against resistance forces said to number upward of 35,000 for 
the Khmer Rouge, 10,000 for pro-Sihanouk forces and 15,000 in the non-Communist 
group headed by Son Sann. 
</P>
<P>
The resistance coalition has held two previous rounds of talks with the Hun Sen 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides remain divided over the question of who would hold power during 
the transition period after the Vietnamese withdrawal. There was also 
disagreement on the composition of an international peacekeeping force to 
monitor the Vietnamese withdrawal and keep the peace afterward. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Sihanouk reiterated his desire that an international conference 
should be convened in Paris in August to determine the composition of the 
peacekeeping force.

POPE ATTACKS 'CONTRACEPTIVE IMPERIALISM'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II visited the multi-ethnic, French-administered island of 
Reunion on Monday after ending the first leg of his African tour with a fierce 
attack against "contraceptive imperialism" and "the search for immediate 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
French Premier Michel Rocard, a Protestant, met the white-robed pontiff 
together with thousands of the faithful as he stepped off an Air Madagascar 
jetliner and kissed the ground at the Indian Ocean island's Gillot Airport. 
</P>
<P>
A chorus representing the island's African, Malagasy, Indian, Chinese and 
European ethnicities sang the popular local song, "It Smells Like Banana, 
Vanilla and Cumin," which tells of celebrating Christmas during the summer on 
the island, which lies in the Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Reunion, the most remote of France's overseas territories, remains a stronghold 
of the Roman Catholic Church, with 94% of the island's 500,000 residents 
baptized into the faith. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul flew to Reunion after concluding a four-day trip to the island of 
Madagascar, 600 miles away, by reiterating his strong opposition to any form of 
artificial birth control. 
</P>
<P>
"The teaching of the church appears difficult," the pontiff conceded in a 
homily during a solemn open-air Mass he celebrated at the southern Malagasy 
city of Fianarantsoa. "But many couples bear witness that it is possible to 
follow it, and that it is even a liberation compared with what is called 
'contraceptive imperialism,' which so often is to the detriment of the woman," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope warned that "the search for immediate pleasure counts for more to 
certain people than the more truly human value of giving oneself to one's 
partner for the whole of life."

W. GERMAN AGAIN REJECTS NEED TO UPGRADE MISSILES

West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher rejected again Monday the 
warnings Bonn has received from Washington and London that NATO needs to 
upgrade its short-range nuclear missiles, rather than negotiating to cut their 
number. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and London say it is essential to update the aging Lance short-range 
nuclear weapons, which are based in West Germany, rather than negotiate a low 
East-West ceiling on them. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not new -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had discussed 
the possibility of East-West talks on reducing the weapons in 1987 and 1988 -- 
and should be dealt with now, Genscher told the Frankfurter Rundschau 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"The point . . . is to give reality to the intention stressed in two important 
alliance decisions," Genscher said. "It should be possible to find a way to do 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not doubt the good will of all the alliance partners involved," he said 
in the interview released by the Foreign Ministry ahead of newspaper 
publication today. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher spelled out her interpretation of NATO 
policy to Chancellor Helmut Kohl during a daylong visit to West Germany on 
Sunday, insisting on updating the Lance and avoiding the negotiations issue. 
</P>
<P>
The question of the weapons, which have a range of up to 300 miles, is expected 
to be the main theme at NATO's 40th anniversary summit in Brussels on May 
29-30.

SAILING ON SEINE: PARIS PASSENGER SERVICE LAUNCHED 
</P>

With a powerful rumble from its twin diesel engines, the 10 a.m. river bus 
Rhone pulled away from its moorings Monday on the maiden voyage of what city 
officials hope will become the first regular passenger service along the Seine 
since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
It was a beautiful clear spring day. Girl scouts sold traditional May 1 
bouquets of lilies-of-the-valley on the river banks. Boat pilot Jean-Luc Daled, 
28, delighted with his new occupation as river bus driver, expertly guided the 
60-foot boat between the bridge pillars and maintained a flowing commentary. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep your distance from the bateaux mouches," he said, pointing to 
one of the huge tourist boats with several hundred passengers 50 yards 
upstream. "You can't stop one of these things like a car. Still, the traffic is 
much better down here on the river than it is up on the streets. It's very 
relaxed, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers on this initial voyage were journalists, who busied 
themselves during the 45-minute round-trip interviewing each other and speaking 
for French, Japanese, German and Italian television cameras about the joys and 
beauties of river travel as opposed to the hassles and vulgarities of subway 
and bus transport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Curious Tourists 
</P>
<P>
But as the 158-passenger craft made the circuit of five stops between the 
Eiffel Tower and Paris City Hall, it began to gather a few legitimate fares, 
mostly curious tourists who had seen the ticket booths and tented passenger 
shelters along the river. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger boat service will be operated as an experiment until Sept. 30 to 
test the market, said Jean-Pierre Cuny, director of Bateaux Parisian, the 
private company that won the contract from the city of Paris and the government 
ministry in charge of river traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, two batobus -- a combination name formed by its French government 
sponsors from bateau (boat) and autobus -- will run daily routes between 10 
a.m. and 8 p.m. Tickets are expensive compared to subway and bus fares -- $5 
for a single trip compared to 50 cents for a subway ride. 
</P>
<P>
The river ride is also considerably slower. For example, the trip between Port 
de la Bourdonnais underneath the Eiffel Tower to Quai de Montebello across from 
Notre Dame Cathedral takes 25 minutes, compared to only three minutes on the 
underground train that follows the same route. 
</P>
<P>
"The ground transportation system is so good it is hard to beat," admitted 
Cuny. However, officials are hoping for a steady flow of tourists, who can also 
buy cheaper all-day or weekly passes, and Parisians who want relief from the 
pressures of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said government spokesman Bertrand Duteil in defense of the batobus, 
"We may not be as fast as the subway. But we are able to show that the average 
speed of a city bus is less than 10 kilometers per hour (6 m.p.h.) while the 
batobus can do 12 kilometers per hour (7 m.p.h.)." 
</P>
<P>
The river bus system has many critics, especially among those who run the 
bateaux mouches sightseeing boats. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an old file that keeps popping up," said Michel Bryere, commercial 
director for one of the larger tourist boat companies. "If the idea of the 
system is to make a profit from Parisians by taking them to work, then it is 
not possible." 
</P>
<P>
The last regular commercial transport system on the Seine, the vaporetto boats 
that plied the river between Suresnes and the Marne River, went bankrupt in 
1935. A recent similar attempt -- entitled River Bus -- to provide passenger 
traffic on the Thames in London has suffered financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
However, many Parisians remember fondly several weeks in 1972 when subway and 
train strikes almost brought the city to a standstill. Several of the bateaux 
mouches operators ran regular routes up and down the river. 
</P>
<P>
"During the strikes of 1972, I carried 7,000 people a day in my boats," 
recalled boat operator Jean Brunet. "I'm ready to go again if this proves 
successful."

FRENCH JEWS DEMONSTRATE ON EVE OF PLO LEADER'S VISIT

<P>
On the eve of a two-day visit to France by Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, Jewish groups and sympathizers demonstrated Monday 
outside a delicatessen-restaurant where terrorists killed six people in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of several protests against the "official visit" by Arafat, who 
will meet with French President Francois Mitterrand this morning, protesters 
waved Israeli flags and shouted "Arafat, assassin!" in a Jewish neighborhood of 
the Marais district. 
</P>
<P>
More demonstrations are planned today at a synagogue that terrorists bombed in 
1980. Meanwhile, Arab groups and Arafat sympathizers plan a 
counterdemonstration in another district of the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations reflect the bitter divisions in the French Jewish and Arab 
communities over the visit. Although Arafat met previously with political 
leaders in Italy and Spain, PLO leaders consider the Mitterrand invitation the 
organization's most important acknowledgment since Arafat declared Israel's 
right to exist and renounced terrorism on behalf of the PLO late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision by President Mitterrand is courageous," Arafat said in an 
interview in a French magazine. He called France "the premier power on the 
Mediterranean." 
</P>
<P>
The visit was condemned Monday by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this meeting as an affront to the friendship between Israel and France. 
I also believe this meeting damages the chances of peace in the Middle East," 
Shamir said on Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand, the first French president ever to visit Israel, attempted to 
reassure the French Jewish community with a Passover letter that discussed the 
Arafat visit. 
</P>
<P>
"France will not forget either the victims of the Holocaust or of blind 
terrorism," Mitterrand wrote. "This cruel and despicable past remains in our 
memories as we conduct foreign policy. But this policy is founded on the idea 
of dialogue, which means listening to all the protagonists." 
</P>
<P>
The French government has emphasized that the Arafat visit does not imply 
recognition of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the French Jewish community itself is deeply divided over the visit. 
Marie-Claire Mendes France, widow of former Premier Pierre Mendes France, a 
Jew, said: "I think it is a good idea for Francois Mitterrand to listen to what 
Yasser Arafat has to say." 
</P>
<P>
"Yasser Arafat is my enemy," leading French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy 
said. "He is the enemy of all the Jews. I understand totally those who are 
revolted by the visit. That said, let's get serious. It is with one's enemies, 
not one's friends, that one negotiates." 
</P>
<P>
As the anti-Arafat demonstration raged outside his delicatessen and restaurant, 
the site of an August, 1982, attack in which six were killed and 22 seriously 
injured, owner Jo Goldenberg, 67, seemed caught himself in the same ambiguity 
about the visit. Goldenberg said he is convinced that Arafat or his 
organization was behind the attack, in which two men burst into the restaurant 
and opened fire with machine-pistols. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he is not sure the Arafat visit is such a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very delicate," he said. "On the one hand, it is very awkward and 
embarrassing for the Jewish community in France. On the other hand, I can't say 
I am totally against the visit. I am also French. The best interests of France 
may have nothing to do with Israel."

INVESTORS DEFEND OIL DEAL THAT BENEFITED WRIGHT

<P>
Texas oil investors, breaking their silence on a 1988 deal that provided 
Speaker Jim Wright with a quick profit of about $350,000, defended the 
transaction Monday as "entirely legitimate" and rejected suggestions in a House 
Ethics Committee report that it may have been a disguised gift to the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by their Washington lawyer, the Texans also accused 
Richard J. Phelan, the committee's special counsel, of displaying 
"prosecutorial zeal" in the Wright investigation and renewed their challenge to 
the committee's authority to require their testimony later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Texans' lawyer, Stanley M. Brand, said it is still "an open question" 
whether his five clients will comply with the subpoenas and appear before the 
panel to answer questions under oath Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Straight-Up Deal' 
</P>
<P>
Their statement was issued "to set the record straight . . . to show that the 
deal is a straight-up deal by responsible businessmen," Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial Sabine Lake oil-and-gas investment, rather than being 
worthless as Phelan's report implied, may contain oil and gas valued at $100 
million, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Although two earlier drilling attempts failed to produce any results and the 
well was plugged and abandoned last summer, the statement said, the investors 
now expect to drill a third time at an additional cost of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. John T. 
Myers (R-Ind.), the ranking Republican on the panel, were rebuffed last week 
when they went to San Antonio to take testimony from the five Texans, including 
veteran Democratic Party fund-raiser Morris D. Jaffe and his son, Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
The Jaffes and three others involved in the Sabine Lake deal refused to appear 
and challenged the right of the House committee to investigate the transaction. 
The panel, however, rejected the challenge and demanded that the investors 
appear this week as part of the committee's effort to complete its 10-month 
inquiry into Wright's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investment Company 
</P>
<P>
A 4% interest in the oil well was acquired by Mallightco, an investment company 
Wright had formed with Ft. Worth real estate developer George A. Mallick Jr., 
for about $90,000 on Jan. 12, 1988, the Texans stated. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Mallick had contacted Morris Jaffe late in 1987 to ask about 
possible oil ventures for $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time did Mallick mention that he was acting for Jim Wright, Mallightco 
or anyone other than himself," the Texans' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick's son, Michael, then contacted Douglas Jaffe and bought a 4% interest 
in the Sabine Lake tract that was reflected in a Jan. 12, 1988, letter of 
agreement. Later, the statement said, the younger Jaffe decided to offer a West 
German firm, Union Rheinische Petroleum, a chance to buy a 2.5% interest from 
Mallightco for $440,000 -- which was paid in the form of a loan. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's interest in Mallightco was bought out by his partner last June, using 
funds from the $440,000 loan, yielding the Speaker a profit of about $350,00 on 
his investment in Mallightco. 
</P>
<P>
In his report on Wright's dealings, special counsel Phelan said that, "while 
the 'loan' from URP appears to be a gift to Michael Mallick or Mallightco, we 
cannot yet conclude that any House rules were violated." Phelan noted that 
Wright's holdings in Mallightco were in a blind trust at the time of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging Phelan's interpretation of the complex transactions, the Texans' 
statement rejected his contention that the price paid by the West German firm 
was "dramatically greater" than the value of the oil property last May. An 
April 3, 1988, test of the well showed "phenomenal quantities of oil and gas" 
that the owners believe can be recovered in the future, the Texans said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Prestridge, consulting geologist on the Sabine Lake investment who is one 
of the five people under subpoena, estimated eventual profits of $44 million 
from the well, or roughly $443,500 for each 1% interest, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based upon the Prestridge analysis, which reflected a value of over $440,000 
for each 1% working interest, this seemed to be an extremely favorable deal for 
URP," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
But the drilling ran into problems and, after a second well was started last 
August without any productive results, the two wells were plugged and abandoned 
last Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Wall Street Journal disclosed Monday that Wright gave a warm 
endorsement to a Seattle, Wash., company after it put his wife, Betty, on the 
payroll at a salary of $36,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's remarks about a family-oriented video program by the Pacific Institute 
were placed in the Congressional Record on Dec. 9, 1985. Betty Wright began 
working for the firm in September, 1984, at the same time she was an 
$18,000-a-year employee of Mallightco. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker said the series of 21 videocassettes put out by the Pacific 
Institute were "marvelously useful . . . to promote togetherness" at "a nominal 
price within the range of most American families." 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker is facing charges that his wife's Mallightco salary, along with the 
free use of a car and an apartment in Ft. Worth, amounted to $145,000 worth of 
illegal gifts from Mallick to Wright in violation of House rules. 
</P>
<P>
Wright has denied any wrongdoing and has asked to present his defense as soon 
as possible to the Ethics Committee, which will judge whether the allegations 
are proven or not.

PAIR AGAIN REPORT BABY TAKEN; FIRST FOUND DEAD

Police investigated a report Monday that a masked gunman abducted a baby girl 
from a couple who made the same complaint three years ago about another 
daughter who was found dead only yards from their house. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Robert and Paula Sims reported their 6-week-old daughter, Heather, 
missing from her bassinet after a masked gunman knocked Paula Sims unconscious, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The report was identical to one filed in 1986 in nearby Brighton when the 
Simses' 13-day-old daughter, Loralei, turned up missing. Her body was found 
five days later near the Simses' house. No arrest was made, although the 
parents were considered suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"What are the chances of somebody breaking into your house and taking your 
small infant child once in your life?" police Sgt. Billy Lawrence said. "You 
figure out the odds, and then figure out the odds that it could happen a second 
time in a completely different city. But I'm not trying to say anything." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, police in this Mississippi River city across from St. Louis said 
they were still treating Heather's disappearance as a reported kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything we can possibly do, but we have no idea where the 
child is," police Sgt. Bud Pyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told (Mrs. Sims) was approached by a male outside the home, forced 
back inside the house and knocked unconscious," Pyatt said. "But we have no 
information other than what was obtained yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
The reported timing of the abductions was nearly identical. In 1986, Paula Sims 
said she was knocked out about 10:20 p.m. On Saturday, she told police the 
assailant struck at 10:30 p.m. as she took out the trash.

MWD SHELVES ITS EXPANSION SURCHARGE BILL 
</P>

<P>
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California Monday temporarily 
withdrew a controversial bill that would have cleared the way for the giant 
water agency to levy a surcharge on property in its six-county service area. 
</P>
<P>
The surcharge is one of several revenue sources the district had considered 
using to finance a $3-billion expansion program primarily in San Diego and 
Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Legislature gave the district the authority in 1984 to levy up to 
a $10-per-parcel surcharge, it never provided a mechanism for collecting the 
money. The legislation by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) would have allowed 
county tax collectors to collect the charge for the district. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the bill) had simply become more controversial than we thought it 
warranted," said Jay Malinowski, a spokesman for the district. "In our minds 
the contents of the bill are not significant enough to cause that kind of 
controversy. It really doesn't do anything new except set up a mechanism to 
collect a charge we're already authorized to collect." 
</P>
<P>
Malinowski said that inasmuch as the district had not planned to levy the 
charge for several years, the shelving of the bill would only delay its 
financial planning for the massive expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
He said officials will renew their efforts to pass it next year after its 
critics have had more time to review it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously not going to come up this year in the Legislature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill became controversial when some members of the district's Board of 
Directors complained that the board's decision to push its passage in the 
Legislature had been made hurriedly without adequate public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
And even Monday they complained that the decision to withdraw it was being made 
without public notice by General Manager Carl Boronkay in consultation with the 
board's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it has been made a two-year bill but I think the system stinks," said 
Tom Brick, who represents Pasadena on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Brick said he had hoped that by opposing the bill he could force the district 
to re-examine its proposals for financing the expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
By levying a surcharge, he said the district would be able to force all of its 
14 million customers to pay for expansion that would only benefit about 4 
million water users. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous subsidy really to the outlying areas," he said. "I don't 
think the already developed areas of Southern California should be forced to 
pay for this very expensive expansion." 
</P>
<P>
Brick said the district's decision to charge every user the same rate -- often 
called the postage stamp philosophy -- conflicts with recent trends in local 
government financing. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole direction in municipal government has been to make the user pay. The 
new user should have to pay the price of conveying the facilities to his area," 
he said.

JUDGE HALTS DEPORTING OF SALVADORANS, SAYS INS VIOLATED ASYLUM HELP ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles has halted the deportation of several hundred 
Salvadorans from a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service dention facility 
in Texas, ruling that the detainees have been denied access to telephones and 
lawyers in order to apply for political asylum in this country. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling issued Friday, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon held that INS 
officials were in violation of an April, 1988, order he authored requiring the 
agency to provide help for Salvadorans seeking political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights attorneys had argued that immigration officials routinely deported 
thousands of Salvadorans to their homeland without advising them of their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although INS officials assured Kenyon that all Salvadorans at the INS center in 
Port Isabel were advised of the right to apply for political asylum, the judge 
held otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of a group of 67 Salvadorans deported from Port Isabel on April 20, none 
were represented by counsel at their deportation hearings," the judge said in 
his ruling. "The court finds it difficult to believe that each of these 
individuals learned of knowingly and effectively waived his or her right to 
counsel." 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's order remains in effect until a May 30 hearing on the matter.

FDA PANEL BACKS DRUG FOR AIDS-RELATED PNEUMONIA

Final marketing approval for aerosol Pentamidine, a drug to prevent 
AIDS-related pneumonia, was unanimously recommended Monday by a Food and Drug 
Administration advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said the drug, made by Lyphomed Inc. of Melrose Park, Ill., could 
gain final agency approval "in a matter of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The drug is already widely available to AIDS patients in this country under a 
special FDA effort to cut through red tape when desperately ill or dying 
patients are involved. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing research results and hearing two hours of testimony from the 
public, the committee concluded that aerosol Pentamidine is safe and its 
benefits outweigh its risks in the prevention of AIDS-related pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers who had evaluated the drug in a trial involving 408 patients in the 
San Francisco area told the panel it reduced the risk fourfold when given once 
a month in a 300-milligram dose, compared to a 30-milligram dose. 
</P>
<P>
FDA staff reviewers said more study is needed to gauge the drug's long-term 
side effects and benefits, but recommended approval nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The same panel today will review the safety and effectiveness of another drug 
for an AIDS-related infection. It will examine a drug called Ganciclovir, made 
by Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto.

RIGHT TO USE SECRET POLITICAL DONATION AS PLOY REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday dismissed pro-Israeli activist Michael R. Goland's 
bid to assert he had a constitutional right to make anonymous campaign 
contributions to a minor party candidate to aid the campaign of Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
Ruling that Goland's constitutional challenge was "frivolous," U.S. District 
Judge Ronald S. W. Lew also refused Goland's petition asking the judge to 
remove himself from the case unless he discloses the name of the candidate he 
voted for in the 1986 Senate election. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly have no doubt that I can decide and maintain an appearance of 
fairness and impartiality without having to divulge who I voted for," the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Goland, 41, faces trial this month in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles with 
two co-defendants on charges that they illegally funneled secret contributions 
to American Independent Party candidate Edward B. Vallen with the aim of 
siphoning votes away from Cranston's Republican opponent, Ed Zschau. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual civil action filed shortly after the indictment, Goland's lawyers 
sought to assert a 1st Amendment right to make anonymous contributions in order 
to aid another candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of defeating a major party candidate by getting people to vote for a 
minor party candidate is not a new concept," argued Goland's lawyer, Nathan 
Lewin. "We say, in circumstances where an individual wants to provide an 
anonymous contribution to a minor party candidate who has no chance of winning, 
to defeat a major party candidate, that is constitutionally protected." 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. George Newhouse and an attorney for the Federal 
Elections Commission argued that there is no way of defining what kinds of 
candidates have no chance of winning, nor of determining whether an anonymous 
donor qualifies as a contributor with legitimate interests in remaining 
unnamed. 
</P>
<P>
"The right Goland sought to exercise was the right to conduct political dirty 
tricks," Newhouse argued in court papers. "Whatever else he was trying to 
accomplish by sabotaging Zschau's campaign, Goland, the Donald Segretti of the 
1980s, was clearly not interested in exercising his 1st Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
Goland's lawyers said they would seek an emergency ruling from the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, delaying the trial, now set for May 16, pending the 
appeals court's review of the constitutional issue.

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: CIGARETTE ADS: A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
DOONESBURY STRIP DRAWS AD AGENCY CREATIVE TYPES INTO MORAL FRAY OVER 
ASSIGNMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Doonesbury sometimes seems like the kind of guy whose most pressing problem is 
whether to lunch on Cajun chicken or duck sausage pizza. But the oh-so-hip 
comic strip character has spent the past two weeks wrestling with a question 
that delves -- if not stabs -- into the heart of the advertising business: Do 
people who create commercials have any conscience? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, at least the one reached by Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau, won't 
leave many advertising executives with whiter shirts or brighter teeth. Rather, 
it would seem to leave most with ring around the collar. 
</P>
<P>
In the comic strip, the character Michael J. Doonesbury, who is employed as a 
copywriter at an ad agency, is asked by an R. J. Reynolds executive to create a 
print advertising campaign that will coax more young people to start smoking. 
What's more, Doonesbury is led to believe that his very job at the agency 
depends on accepting the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of soul-searching -- including a dream sequence in which he 
invents an animated pitchman shaped like a cigarette -- Doonesbury finally 
accepts the assignment. And this single decision seems to cast a pretty large 
shadow over the entire ad industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no shortage of people willing to go to work making ads for cigarette 
companies," said John M. Connors Jr., president of the Boston ad firm Hill, 
Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, which creates ads for John Hancock and Wang. 
While his agency doesn't handle any cigarette companies, he says it would at 
least consider it. 
</P>
<P>
But has Doonesbury been presenting an accurate picture of the ad industry? Are 
ad agency workers sometimes asked to put their morals aside and work on 
advertising for products -- like cigarettes or liquor -- that they don't 
condone? And if so, just how many refuse to work on projects for advertisers 
such as cigarette makers? 
</P>
<P>
Well, how about one in five? 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is the case at one New York ad firm that creates advertising 
for Richland and Capri cigarettes, both made by Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco 
Corp. "About 20% of our people might not want to work on our cigarette 
account," said Peter Geer, president of Geer, DuBois Inc., which also creates 
ads for Jaguar. "It's a distinct minority," Geer said of those who won't create 
cigarette ads, "but it's a significant number." 
</P>
<P>
And what happens if they don't want to? Well, Geer said, they are simply 
assigned to a different client. At the same time, however, Geer said that 
before hiring new employees, his agency sometimes asks people if they would 
object to working on cigarette ad business. "But that doesn't mean we wouldn't 
hire them if they said yes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Brandalise says she has turned down lucrative offers to create ads for 
tobacco products. But she is a free-lance copy writer based in Los Angeles. And 
she says it's easier for her to say no than for many of her friends who work 
full time at agencies. "I have nothing to lose," she said, "but they can lose 
their jobs." Of course, many agencies have never faced this problem because 
they've never even had the opportunity to create ads for tobacco companies. 
That situation, however, can change almost over night. 
</P>
<P>
And the biggest ad agency in the Los Angeles area, Chiat/Day, is facing that 
issue right now. In the past, the unwritten policy at Venice-based Chiat/Day 
was not to create cigarette advertising. But now, Chiat/Day, which creates ads 
for Nissan, is purchasing an Australian ad firm, Mojo MDA, that creates 
advertising overseas for a Philip Morris brand. So has Chiat/Day changed its 
tune on cigarette advertising? The company's chairman, Jay Chiat, won't say. "I 
have no comment on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Los Angeles ad executive, however, was willing to comment. "If it's 
legal to sell something, it should be legal to advertise it," said Patrick 
King, AC&amp;R/CCL Advertising Inc. King formerly worked for a large Australian 
firm that created ads for several cigarette brands. 
</P>
<P>
But if someone at his agency has any moral problems working on a tobacco 
account -- or any other account -- they could just work on another, he said. 
And that is where the recent Doonesbury comic strip was off base, King said. 
"It's message was totally not real in the world of advertising agencies," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Doonesbury creator Trudeau declined to be interviewed. But a spokesman for 
Universal Press Syndicate, the Kansas City, Mo., company that distributes the 
comic strip, said too many people take the comic strip literally. "I would hope 
that people don't base their views of the ad world on a comic strip," said Lee 
Salem, editorial director. "Remember, some of Trudeau's favorite tools are 
exaggeration and hyperbole." 
</P>
<P>
Hyperbole or not, R. J. Reynolds executives are hardly humored by the strip. 
"The simple fact is, we don't target our advertising to appeal to young 
people," said David Fishel, vice president of public relations at 
Winston-Salem-based RJR Nabisco. "What's more, advertising has almost nothing 
to do with anyone starting to smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everyone buys that line. In fact, the chairman of one major New 
York ad agency is so certain that advertising can persuade kids to start 
smoking that his firm refuses to create ads for cigarettes. It will, however, 
create ads for non-tobacco products made by these companies. "We will never 
create any cigarette advertisements," said Robert Schmidt, chairman of Levine, 
Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver. "There has to be some social conscience to an ad 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
That social conscience, however, must often expand beyond the issue of tobacco 
advertising, he said. Several years ago, Schmidt's agency was among several 
chasing the $10 million in advertising business for the World Gold Council, 
which is primarily funded by South African gold mining companies. "We were 
really on the fence with this one," said Schmidt, because many people at the ad 
firm had problems with the apartheid policy of racial segregation practiced in 
South Africa. "We backed out after our second meeting. It was a combination of 
conscience -- and not falling in love with the people involved." 
</P>
<P>
But the ad firm does handle a substantial amount of advertising for E&amp;J 
Gallo Winery. And one of the its top art directors recently asked not to work 
on the account for religious reasons. "You have to honor that kind of thing," 
Schmidt said. "Of course, if you're a tiny agency and it's the only copywriter 
in the joint who won't work on a new piece of business, you've got a problem." 
</P>

N.Y. Daily News Pitch Using Yankee Slugger 
</P>
<P>
What was ailing New York Yankee slugger Dave Winfield doing in Los Angeles the 
other day? 
</P>
<P>
Not taking batting practice, that's for sure. While recovering from recent back 
surgery, Winfield was in Los Angeles to star in several commercials for the New 
York Daily News that were filmed by Livingston 5 Inc., a Los Angeles production 
company. The spots will air continually in the New York market until Winfield 
returns to uniform. 
</P>
<P>
The spots portray Winfield as keeping up with the Yankees only through reading 
the sports section of the Daily News. "The good news to my fans is, I'll be 
back," Winfield says in one spot. "The bad news to those other teams is, I'll 
be back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency Covering Broad Field With New Clients 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder about the wide variety of advertisers handled by a single agency? 
</P>
<P>
During the past several weeks, the Irvine-based firm AC&amp;R/CCL Advertising 
picked up five new accounts -- totaling $15 million -- that seem to indicate 
how varied the ad business can be. Its biggest new client is San Jose-based 
Samsung Information Systems America, which wants the agency to create a 
newspaper campaign about its personal computer systems. The firm also picked up 
Unitek/3M, one of the world's largest makers of orthodontic products. And it 
also added a Tustin company called SMI, which sells drug abuse prevention 
products. "Los Angeles is alive and well as an advertising market," said 
Patrick King, chairman of the agency's West Coast office. "And so is Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ad's Point: Boating's Fun -- Without Alcohol 
</P>
<P>
The striking print advertisement shows a lone pleasure boat that looks as if it 
has been front-ended by a big rig on the San Diego Freeway. Above the picture 
is the headline: "Scotch and Water Don't Mix." 
</P>
<P>
The ad will begin running just weeks after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker accident 
in Alaska, which involved a captain whose tests showed he was legally 
intoxicated. The campaign, which was created by the Los Angeles office of 
Hakuhodo Advertising, breaks this month in such magazines as Boating, Yachting 
and Outdoor Life. The campaign was underwritten by Hakuhodo's client, the 
Marine division of American Suzuki Motor Corp., which makes outboard motors. 
</P>
<P>
There's some eerie reality in the ad, too. The boat pictured in the ad was 
pulled from a Los Angeles boat yard after it was involved in an accident, said 
Louis Vega, vice president at Hakuhodo. Some 600 people are involved annually 
in alcohol-related boating fatalities. Two, he said, were killed in that boat.

10,000 ANGRY CREDIT CARD HOLDERS DELUGE EXXON WITH PLASTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Customers have sent back about 10,000 service station credit cards to Exxon 
Corp. as part of an apparently widening nationwide protest of the company's 
handling of the huge oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The returned cards represent only one-seventh of 1% of Exxon's 7 million credit 
cards, but the oil company issued statements expressing concern. A number of 
environmental groups, claiming that Exxon's cleanup efforts have been 
lackluster, have asked consumers to boycott the company's products in the wake 
of the massive March 24 spill, when the Exxon Valdez went aground and more than 
10 million gallons of crude oozed into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 16 Democratic California lawmakers Monday joined legislators in at 
least six other states in urging a boycott of Exxon products. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other groups organizing boycotts is Citizens for Environmental 
Responsibility, a non-profit group that has placed a newspaper ad asking 
consumers to cut their Exxon cards in two and mail them to an office in Los 
Gatos. For those who do not own Exxon cards, the ad carries a checkoff box that 
can be used to pledge support for the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has received 500 cards thus far, said Stephen Nissen, a Los 
Angeles-based spokesman for the group. Nissen said the cards would be forwarded 
to Exxon when more are gathered. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott effort "is one of many brush fires that will grow into a forest 
fire," Nissen said. "It's going to take awhile for the impact to be felt -- but 
it will be felt." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials have said there have been some "localized effects" on business 
at their service stations. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, several Exxon station managers say they have not 
experienced a falloff in business. But they expressed concern about the 
possibility of a growing boycott movement. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Yee, owner of an Exxon station at the corner of Colorado and Eagle Rock 
boulevards in Eagle Rock, said many of his customers have questioned him about 
the spill and Exxon's clean-up efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our fault," he said. "I tell them we don't have anything to do with 
the spill." 
</P>
<P>
Yee said he has tried to keep his customers by offering lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Eytan Rosenberg, who operates an Exxon station at 307 N. La Brea in 
Los Angeles, said many of his customers have talked about mailing back their 
credit cards. But Rosenberg also said he hasn't felt much of the impact of the 
protest yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business hasn't slowed down much because we're in a busy area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Exxon has taken out newspaper ads across the country to plead its 
case. The ads said a boycott would not clean up the spilled oil, and added: 
"But it is going to hurt a lot of small businessmen in your community -- and 
their families and employees. They have nothing to do with the accident in 
Alaska, but they're taking the brunt of the anger. And they stand to lose 
income at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12,000 Exxon stations nationwide, only 5% are owned by the company. The 
rest are individually owned, or operated by independent dealers who own a group 
of stations, Exxon said. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, the group of 16 state lawmakers announced support for a 
nationwide consumer boycott of Exxon oil products. The Democratic legislators 
would join state legislators from New York, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode 
Island, Wisconsin and Connecticut in calling for the boycott, planned for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"All Californians are outraged by the oil spill in Alaska," Berkeley 
Assemblyman Tom Bates, an organizer of the boycott, said in a prepared 
statement. "We want to show Exxon that corporations who harm the environment 
will pay a price in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Bates urged Exxon to roll back recent gas price increases, pay all cleanup 
costs, establish a $1-billion environmental trust fund and pay for safe tankers 
and spill contingency programs.

WPP GROUP BID FOR OGILVY EXPANDS BRITISH PUSH INTO WORLD'S MAJOR AD MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shares of Ogilvy Group jumped more than $17 Monday following an unsolicited 
$725-million bid for the New York advertising concern by the British firm WPP 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
If an acquisition eventually does take place -- as many analysts predict it 
will -- Ogilvy would join the growing list of major U.S. advertising agencies 
that have fallen into British hands. This despite a letter sent Sunday by 
Kenneth Roman, chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy, to WPP chief Martin S. 
Sorrell, which stated: "Ogilvy and WPP have fundamentally different strategies 
and goals." 
</P>
<P>
Expectations that the takeover battle would continue propelled Ogilvy stock to 
close at $49.125 a share, up $17.125. 
</P>
<P>
Just two years ago, WPP purchased the giant U.S. advertising agency, J. Walter 
Thompson. And over the past several years, another British ad giant, Saatchi 
&amp; Saatchi Co. PLC, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase a 
handful of major U.S advertising agencies, now Saatchi &amp; Saatchi 
Advertising, Backer Spielvogel Bates, AC&amp;R and Campbell-Mithun-Esty. 
</P>
<P>
A WPP takeover of Ogilvy, parent of the agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, would 
create the world's second largest advertising holding company after Saatchi 
&amp; Saatchi. Clearly, much of the growth of Saatchi and WPP has come from 
swooping up major U.S. advertising agencies. "It's inevitable," said Carl 
Spielvogel, chairman of the New York ad firm Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, 
which was purchased by Saatchi in 1986. "The U.S. is still the largest ad 
market in the world. They want to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
But the British companies are buying American advertising agencies not so much 
for the agencies themselves, but to get their hands on the clients whose 
advertising billings can be in the multimillions. Some critics say, however, 
these huge British-owned agencies don't always make better advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in the business of business," said Robert H. Schmidt, chairman of the 
New York ad firm, Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver, which creates ads for 
Subaru. "They're not in the ad business." 
</P>
<P>
Some clients share those feelings. And because of that -- or other conflicts -- 
some major clients have left shortly after their U.S. ad agencies were 
purchased by big British holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Clients Concerned 
</P>
<P>
Already, at least two of Ogilvy's largest clients are raising concerns about 
the prospect of their ad agency being owned by a foreigner. Among those clients 
calling to express concerns to Ogilvy &amp; Mather Chairman William E. Phillips 
on Monday were American Express and Ford Motor Co. "They don't like to have 
their business taken for granted," said Jonathan Rinehart, an Ogilvy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ogilvy that created the highly regarded "members" print advertising 
campaign featuring first-rate photographs of celebrities such as Ray Charles 
and Tip O'Neil. But American Express officials were clearly not pleased Monday 
with the current situation at Ogilvy. "Anything," said vice president of public 
affairs Nancy Muller, "that might affect the level of service or the commitment 
we receive or the creative output of the agency would be of great concern to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Said one advertsing executive, "Imagine American Express having its image 
created by a British-owned company." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, clients have walked out on WPP in the past. Two years ago, shortly 
after WPP acquired J. Walter Thompson in a hostile takeover, giant Burger King 
took its $200 million ad business elsewhere. Other clients bailed out, too, 
including Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. and the Slice soft drink business. In 
total, the WPP's Thompson lost nearly $450 million in business after the WPP 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
None of this, however, is stopping WPP's Sorrell from chasing after Ogilvy. And 
many analysts say, with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising is a business that we might have invented," said Alan J. 
Gottesman, analyst at New York investment firm, Paine Webber Inc., "but maybe 
we did too good a job in training everyone else how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Gottesman warned, WPP could be wading into waters 
over its head. "Can a company get too big for its own good? Yes," said 
Gottesman. He noted that in late March, giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi surprised 
some investors at its annual meeting when it announced that it expected 1989 
pretax profits to be lower than those in 1988. "Does WPP lend itself to getting 
into that position?" Gottesman posed. "Yes," he answered his own question. 
</P>
<P>
Top advertising executives generally say that the key to success in British 
acquisitions of U.S. agencies is giving a great deal of autonomy to the 
acquired agency. Some critics say WPP's Sorrell certainly didn't do that last 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no place for autonomy in Martin's set-up," said Richard Lord, 
chairman of the New York ad firm, Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners. Lord 
led a walkout of top executives from the ad firm Lord, Geller, Federico, 
Einstein shortly after WPP took over its parent company, J. Walter Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"The signs were not good," said Lord. "We used to have lists when we met with 
Martin. The first item on the list was always the issue of autonomy. We never 
got past it." 
</P>
<P>
But two top U.S. ad executives, whose agencies are owned by Saatchi &amp; 
Saatchi, insist they have plenty of autonomy -- and the mergers have been good 
for their companies 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, we were a U.S. company that quickly needed access to overseas 
markets," said Spielvogel. After all, Spielvogel's client Philip Morris has 
recently purchased General Foods, and Spielvogel knew his agency would suddenly 
be doing lots of international work. For that reason, the timing of the 
agency's purchase by Saatchi was good, he said. This, despite the fact that his 
company lost some big clients that had conflicts with Saatchi. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing Saatchi now asks from the agency is copies of its monthly 
financial statements, said Spielvogel. And nearly four years since it purchased 
Backer Spielvogel Bates, the chief executive of Saatchi has only visited the 
agency once -- for about 20 minutes, said Spielvogel. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Saatchi has made few demands on executives at the New York ad firm 
AC&amp;R, which it also owns. "I have no British creative directors or account 
executives, and no one has suggested that I hire any," said Patrick King, 
president of AC&amp;R, which creates ads for Burlington Industries and Kinney 
Corp. "About the only time I hear from them is at Christmas, when they send me 
a nice greeting. "

About 10,000 credit cards have been sent back to Exxon Corp. in an apparent 
boycott of gasoline service stations in the wake of the March 24 Alaska oil 
spill, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been "scattered incidents of vandalism," a spokesman said in 
reply to questions about actions taken against the company since the oil spill 
of the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound, the worst in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
The returned credit cards represent less than 1% of Exxon's total of 7 million 
credit cards, but the world's largest oil company is concerned, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has seen some "localized effects" on the business of its service 
stations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, several Exxon station managers say they have not 
experienced a falloff in business but expressed concern about the possibility 
of a growing boycott movement. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Yee, owner of an Exxon station at Colorado and Eagle Rock boulevards in 
Eagle Rock, said many of his customers have questioned him about the spill and 
Exxon's cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our fault," he said. "I tell them we don't have anything to do with 
the spill." Yee said he has aggressively sought to retain his customers by 
offering low prices. 
</P>
<P>
Some patrons of another Exxon station at 307 N. LaBrea in Los Angeles have 
called station manager Eytan Rosenberg to discuss mailing back their credit 
cards, he said. Rosenberg applauded the Exxon advertising campaign, noting that 
most Exxon stations are owned by independent businesses. Rosenberg said his 
company leases Exxon facilities and is not an employee of the oil company. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a personal interest in all of this, so I can't say if I would support 
this kind of boycott under different circumstances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Sacramento, 16 state lawmakers announced support Monday for a 
planned nationwide consumer boycott of Exxon oil products. The Democratic 
legislators said they would join state legislators from New York, 
Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, Wisconsin and Connecticut in calling for 
the boycott, planned for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"All Californians are outraged by the oil spill in Alaska," Berkeley 
Assemblyman Tom Bates, organizer of the boycott in the state Capitol, said in a 
statement. "We want to show Exxon that corporations that harm the environment 
will pay a price in the marketplace."

Fines Proposed in Tunnel Blast: The Labor Department proposed $1.15 million in 
fines for two contractors cited for 115 safety violations in a methane gas 
explosion last year that killed three sewer tunnel workers in Milwaukee. S. A. 
Healy Co. of McCook, Ill., was cited for 68 willful violations carrying fines 
of $680,000 and CH2M Hill Central Inc. of Corvallis, Ore., was cited for 47 
willful violations carrying penalties of $470,000. An OSHA official said the 
agency found that electrical power had not been turned off after workers were 
evacuated from the tunnel Nov. 10 after dangerously high levels of methane were 
detected.

Department Stores Agree to Merge: Midwest department store operators Carson 
Pirie Scott &amp; Co. and P. A. Bergner said they have agreed to merge, with 
Bergner acquiring Carson for $454 million. The announcement ends a monthlong 
courtship of Chicago-based Carson that began when Bergner made a $282-million 
buyout offer. Carson Pirie Scott operates 33 stores under its own name, 391 
County Seat specialty stores and 23 Arcadia shops. With the acquisition, 
Bergner's -- a Swiss-owned chain that has operated in the Midwest for 100 years 
and has 33 stores in Illinois and Wisconsin -- will become one of the top 15 
U.S. department store operations with consolidated revenue of about $1 billion.

EASTERN SAYS IT HAS BIDDERS FOR $1.8 BILLION OF ITS ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Eastern Airlines said Monday that it is moving close to the disposition of all 
of the $1.8 billion of assets that it said last week it plans to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said in an announcement that about $1.1 billion worth of assets are 
already under firm sales contracts or are the subject of acceptable offers 
where a firm contract is expected to be announced shortly. 
</P>
<P>
The strikebound airline, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy March 9, also 
said an additional $300 million in assets "are subject to serious discussion 
where reasonable offers have been received." It said acceptable deals could be 
announced "in weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The carrier said the remaining $400 million in asset sales are being discussed 
"with responsible and interested parties." 
</P>
<P>
The $1.1 billion, an Eastern spokesman said, included the Eastern Northeast 
shuttle, which it has agreed to sell to real estate billionaire Donald J. Trump 
for $364 million, and the sale to USAir of gates and routes at Philadelphia for 
$85 million. 
</P>
<P>
Neither transaction has been closed. The airline also announced last week that 
it was leasing for five years a fleet of 14 Boeing 727 jets for $96.6 million 
to Pan American World Airways. 
</P>
<P>
It would not divulge any other pending deals. It has said its valuable Latin 
American routes are available for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said it planned to announce other deals in the "coming weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, whose unions have been on strike since March 4, had said in its 
business plan that it planned to downsize the airline by two-thirds and would 
pay down $900 million in debt. It vowed that it would emerge from bankruptcy by 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said it had filed its report about the current situation concerning the 
sales with the federal bankruptcy court, which must approve all transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said it had received a bid from Chicago hotelier Jay A. Pritzker, but 
it described the offer "at best a generalized expression of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent, has said the airline is not for sale. It 
vowed to continue to operate the smaller carrier. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday before federal bankruptcy Judge Burton R. 
Lifland to decide whether one creditor's suit -- which seeks to auction off the 
airline to individual bidders -- has any validity. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lawsuit, Eastern has 120 days from the filing of its bankruptcy to 
come up with its own reorganization plan. Thus, it cannot be ordered by the 
court to sell the airline as a whole now if it does not want to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The strike has virtually idled Eastern largely because almost all of the 
airline's pilots and flight attendants refused to cross the picket lines of the 
striking machinists union.

Scherer to Go Private: R. P. Scherer Corp., a leading maker of gelatin capsules 
for drugs, medicines and vitamins, said it will go private in a leveraged 
buyout. The company did not price the transaction but sources close to Scherer 
valued it at $440 million. Scherer will be acquired by RPS Corp., a vehicle 
formed by investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. Scherer, based 
in Troy, Mich., said it decided Sept. 30 to seek a buyer for the company. 
Sealed bids were opened last Wednesday and negotiations with Shearson led to 
Monday's deal. Scherer has about 4,400 employees in 22 facilities in 13 
countries.

MAXICARE WON'T BLOCK MEMBERS SWITCHING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maxicare Health Plans' chairman and chief executive, Peter J. Ratican, said 
Monday that the financially troubled company may not object to employers 
immediately giving Maxicare members the option of switching to other health 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Ratican said Maxicare would, however, want to make a presentation to employees 
before the open enrollment. "We would prefer that they have an open 
enrollment," he said in an interview. "If we could be involved in the process, 
we could support it. If they do it without telling us, then we think that is an 
unfair practice." 
</P>
<P>
Some employers contacted Monday said they would be interested in discussing 
with Maxicare an open enrollment under those circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Ratican's statement represents a change in policy adopted by the health 
maintenance organization immediately after it filed for bankruptcy protection 
on March 16. At that time, Maxicare said it would sue employers that attempted 
to hold open enrollment periods that were not regularly scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Open enrollments -- the only time employees can switch health care plans 
without penalty -- are held in January at most companies. Maxicare argued that 
special open enrollments would violate a federal court order barring doctors, 
hospitals and other health care providers from refusing to provide services to 
Maxicare because of past due debts. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the order also applied to employers who contracted with the 
company for health-care coverage, Maxicare won a restraining order barring the 
federal government from allowing its workers -- the largest single group of 
Maxicare members -- to leave Maxicare. 
</P>
<P>
Although Xerox Corp. pressed ahead and allowed its employees to switch to an 
in-house medical plan, other companies have cited the court order as a reason 
for not holding an open enrollment that would allow employees to drop Maxicare. 
Maxicare didn't seek an order against Xerox, Ratican said, because "we can't 
sue everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare simply wants a chance to make its case that it is "alive and well" and 
continues to make available "quality" medical care despite the Chapter 11 
filing. "We want employers to make the decision based upon the facts, not 
emotion." When Maxicare officials have met with employers, "they have decided 
to stay with us. There are a lot of people that didn't have the opportunity to 
sit with us. In some cases, they have chosen to bolt from the system," Ratican 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Maxicare did not participate in the recent open enrollment held at 
Hughes Aircraft in March, Maxicare still retained more than 6,000 of its 16,000 
members, he said. Hughes was in the middle of a regularly scheduled open 
enrollment when Maxicare filed for Chapter 11, but the company held the 
enrollment open for an extra month after the filing. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Lockheed Corp. has also allowed Maxicare enrollees the 
opportunity to switch plans. About half of the 1,700 to 1,800 enrollees dropped 
Maxicare, according to Earl Mink, Lockheed director of employee benefits. Mink 
said last week that Maxicare had not objected to the changes although it was 
not a regular open enrollment period. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Bank of America, which usually has a January enrollment 
period, said it would consider holding a special open enrollment under the 
conditions Maxicare outlined Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times, which has about 2,000 Maxicare enrollees, also said it 
would consider an open enrollment. However, "I'm not sure it's called for," 
said Cynthia K. Zieminski, employee benefits manager. The Times surveyed 
Maxicare members after the bankruptcy filing, she said. Of some 350 people who 
responded, "we only had 60 negative comments." 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare Chief Financial Officer Eugene L. Froelich said the company currently 
has about 625,000 members, down from about 900,000 at the time of the 
bankruptcy filing. Current membership excludes the 54,000-member Ohio plan, 
which the company intends to sell, and a few smaller plans that have been sold 
or dismantled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Froelich said the company paid all current bills due in April and expects to do 
so in May.

8 TO RETURN PROFITS, PAY FINES TO SETTLE REVCO INSIDER CASE

Eight people have agreed to surrender profits and pay fines totaling $1.68 
million for alleged insider trading in the stock of drugstore giant Revco D.S. 
Inc., the Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court, the SEC said Glenn 
Golenberg, head of an investment firm that advised Revco management, told 
outsiders that management was considering a debt-financed takeover of the 
company before the public announcement of the proposed deal three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The information spread, with seven people or their clients eventually earning 
$735,000 by trading in Revco stock, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal under federal securities laws to trade stocks on the basis of 
non-public information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Admission of Guilt 
</P>
<P>
The SEC said Golenberg and the seven others accused in the case have agreed to 
repay the illicit profits and nearly $1 million in fines without admitting or 
denying guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Revco, based in Twinsburg, Ohio, filed for bankruptcy protection last July 
because it couldn't pay a $1.5-billion debt stemming from its management-led 
takeover, a deal known as a leveraged buyout, that was financed mostly with 
borrowed money. Revco became the first big LBO to run into such serious debt 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Golenberg is a member of Revco's board because of his stock holdings, amounting 
to 150,000 Revco shares as of last May 28, said Kathleen Obert, a Revco 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Golenberg agreed to pay a $470,000 penalty and consented to an SEC order 
barring him from acting as a broker, dealer or investment adviser for at least 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Biggest Deal' 
</P>
<P>
"Revco was the biggest deal of my life," he said in a statement after the SEC 
filed the complaint. "It was constantly on my mind; something I lived and 
breathed. Regrettably, I talked about it with a few people who did not have any 
right to know what was going on. I now realize the seriousness of that lapse of 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
The SEC also accused Golenberg of providing information to Steve S. Saltzman of 
Cleveland about the proposed merger of two smaller firms, Magnetics 
International Inc. and H.K. Porter Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said Saltzman made $6,850 buying and selling 2,000 shares of 
Magnetics common stock and made $27,326 purchasing and selling Revco stock. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have known better," Golenberg said of the portion of the complaint 
dealing with Magnetics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Defendants 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants accused of profiting from inside information about the 
Revco buyout, are: 
</P>
<P>
* Bernard Shavitz of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., a business associate of Golenberg. 
The SEC said Shavitz made $214,000 buying and selling Revco stock and is asking 
that Shavitz repay the money and pay a fine of $214,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Van S. Weinberg of Memphis, Tenn., described as a friend of Golenberg. 
Weinberg is accused of earning $65,000 trading Revco stock and leaking inside 
information to the remaining defendants. The SEC required him to surrender the 
profits and pay a $75,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
* Stephen Lightman of Memphis, accused of earning $215,218 trading Revco stock. 
He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine. 
</P>
<P>
* Lawrence S. Adler of Memphis, an account executive with the former E.F. 
Hutton Group Inc., is accused of earning $38,188 for himself and $141,820 for 
clients. He agreed to pay $180,008 in illicit profits and a $19,992 fine. 
</P>
<P>
* Ray H. Dan of St. Louis is accused of making $31,000 trading Revco stock. He 
agreed to repay the money and an equal fine. 
</P>
<P>
* Carl D. Reiter of Germantown, Tenn., is accused by the SEC of making $2,625 
with the inside information. He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine. 
</P>
<P>
Obert declined to comment on the matter, saying "that's entirely between the 
SEC and Mr. Golenberg." She said the company has prepared a five-year business 
plan for reorganization but it has not been filed with the federal bankruptcy 
court.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported erroneously Monday that Glenn Golenberg, owner of 
Golenberg &amp; Co. of Cleveland, was among eight people who agreed to 
surrender illicit profits for alleged insider trading in Revco stock. Golenberg 
agreed to pay a $470,000 penalty, but the federal government found no evidence 
that he profited from information he gained as Revco's investment adviser.

STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS MULL ACTION AGAINST DREXEL 
</P>

<P>
State securities regulators, who now have the power to kick Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. out of their territory, are seriously considering whether they 
should take action against the investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's agreement to settle massive securities fraud charges with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and to plead guilty to six felonies allows 
local regulators to charge Drexel with breaking state laws. 
</P>
<P>
The Drexel settlement was obviously on the administrators' minds as most 
speakers mentioned it during a recent day-long session titled "The Wall Street 
Scandals: What Are the Public Policy Implications?" 
</P>
<P>
The settlement "opens Drexel up to almost any enforcement action a state wants 
to take against Drexel's license," said John Baldwin, president of the North 
American Securities Administrators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been thinking about this for a long time. I think all of us have," 
Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
States can pursue various actions, the most serious being the revocation of 
Drexel's license in their jurisdictions and heavy fines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think, based on comments I've heard informally here, that anyone is 
out for blood. There is no sense in the exercise of stabbing the dead," Baldwin 
said. "On the other hand, we have to protect consumers." 
</P>
<P>
He said the state regulators have also been impressed with Drexel's efforts to 
be cooperative and straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
While Baldwin has been getting positive feedback from state regulators about 
Drexel, he is getting a very different message from investment bankers and 
brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Groups Angry 
</P>
<P>
"Those industry people are mad at Drexel," Baldwin said explaining that other 
financial houses feel that Drexel's alleged illegal activity reflects on them. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been more anti-Drexel sentiment from industry groups than from the 
regulators. Then again, we haven't been hit in the pocketbook," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Drexel made sweeping changes in its management and compliance 
system as part of its settlement with the SEC. It was also put on probation by 
the government for three years. The settlement must still be approved by a 
federal judge -- a move that is being held up by legal complications. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval of the settlement is necessary before Drexel can plead guilty to 
six related criminal charges and pay fines and penalties of $650 million. Part 
of that sum will be used to repay injured investors. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for Drexel to fire its former "junk bond" chief, 
Michael Milken, after it pleads guilty. Milken is technically still employed by 
Drexel, although he will remain on leave of absence until he is fired. 
</P>
<P>
Informal conversations with securities regulators from Delaware to Hawaii 
revealed they were well aware of the implications of Drexel's settlement. 
However, some said they would wait to see if any investors in their states 
would claim injury before deciding what action to take. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest act so far occurred last month, when the New Jersey Casino 
Control Commission banned the firm from doing further business with casinos 
there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Soften Actions 
</P>
<P>
Also, 18 members of the New York Assembly called on the state's attorney 
general to impose a fine of $150 million or more for alleged violations by 
Drexel of state law. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators' biggest concern is protecting consumers. But Baldwin said 
there are several reasons why states may take less severe actions against 
Drexel. Among those reasons are the heavy penalties the company agreed to pay 
and its decision to sell its retail brokerage unit, which deals with individual 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of flesh has been taken out already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said he does not expect a consensus by the 50 individual state 
administrators on which actions should be taken against Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be a meeting of the minds about mitigating circumstances. . 
. . I hope we'll all be fair," Baldwin said.

HIGHEST LEVEL IN 3 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
INTEREST RATE BOOSTED ON SERIES EE SAVINGS BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rate on Series EE savings bonds has been raised to 7.81%, the highest in 
three years, the Treasury Department announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The rate is up from 7.35% and is the highest since 8.36% for the period from 
November, 1985, through April, 1986. The all-time record is 11.09%, from 
November, 1982, through April, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The rate, revised semiannually on May 1 and Nov. 1, is calculated by taking 85% 
of the average return on five-year Treasury notes over the most recent six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
To earn the new rate, in effect for six months for any savings bonds purchased 
between now and Oct. 31, investors must hold the bonds for at least five years. 
If held less than five years, savings bonds will pay 4.16% to 5.75%, depending 
on how long they are held. In any case, interest is exempt from state and local 
taxes, and federal taxes can be deferred until the bonds are redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
Savings bonds can be purchased for a minimum investment of $25 at savings 
institutions, Federal Reserve Bank branches or through payroll savings plans. 
</P>
<P>
However, perhaps because rates have lagged on certificates of deposit and other 
savings-oriented investments, sales of the bonds have fallen short of the 
record postwar sales paces set in fiscal 1986 and 1987, Stephen Meyerhardt, 
Treasury savings bond division spokesman, said.

IRAQ SAYS OPEC TO RAISE QUOTAS TO CURB OUTPUT 
</P>

<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to raise its 
production quota in June to help return bloated prices to the cartel's 
$18-a-barrel target level, Iraq's oil minister said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East Economic Survey quoted Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi as saying an 
increase in the output ceiling should end overproduction by some of the 
organization's 13 members. 
</P>
<P>
Chalabi said the increase is expected to be formalized at a June meeting of 
OPEC ministers and take effect in the second half of the year. A new output 
level has not been determined, the minister said. However, industry observers 
expect an increase of about 1.5 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Nearly Double 
</P>
<P>
Last November, OPEC set a production quota of 18.5 million barrels a day in an 
effort to raise world oil prices, which had fallen to $10 to $12 a barrel. At 
the time, the cartel was producing more than 22 million barrels, far more than 
the market could absorb. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, oil prices have nearly doubled, although several OPEC members are 
producing above their quotas, putting the cartel above its self-imposed limit. 
OPEC does not want to see prices too high, lest they encourage non-OPEC 
producers to increase production. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have both demanded higher quotas, and the 
U.A.E. has consistently been overproducing since November, oil sources have 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Chalabi warned, however, that there could be no going back on the principle of 
equal quotas for Iraq and Iran, which fought an eight-year war ending in a 
cease-fire last August. He said Iraq will not even discuss the matter.

SHORT INTEREST IN VALLEY STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The table below lists the short interest in various Valley stocks. 
</P>
<P>
In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed stock -- in effect betting the 
price will drop -- after which he can buy back the stock at a lower price and 
return the shares to the lender and pocket the difference. Of course, if the 
stock goes up in price, the short seller loses money. 
</P>
<P>
Short interest is the number of shares that have been borrowed for short sales 
and not yet repurchased. Also listed is the average daily volume of stock 
traded in each company.

The first of this year's litter of dog movies enjoyed a fairly strong opening 
over the weekend. Universal's "K-9," starring James Belushi and, yes, a German 
Shepherd named Jerry Lee, grossed $7.5 million at 1,677 theaters, or $4,455 per 
screen. But moviegoers more partial to dead animals continued to keep the 
horror film "Pet Sematary" in the top spot, even though ticket sales dropped 
31% from last week. Meanwhile, the season's most talked-about movie, 
Universal's "Field of Dreams," continues to build strong word-of-mouth, 
garnering a per-screen average of $14,340 at 110 theaters.

* Sex and political intrigue proved a winning combination for "Scandal," the 
film that barely escaped an X rating from the Motion Picture Assn. of America. 
The Miramax film, based on the Profumo sex scandal that rocked the British 
government in the '60s, grossed $630,000 at 94 theaters, a per-screen average 
of $6,702.

DUERR KILLING LINKED WITH DISPLEASURE OVER DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators now believe that Denise Marie Duerr's displeasure over her 
live-in boyfriend's suspected drug-dealings led to the stabbing death of the 
Garden Grove woman, whose body was found dumped near Corona two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence shows that just before her death, the 21-year-old Duerr got in an 
argument with boyfriend, Clyde Spontak, about drug-dealing -- a subject of 
prolonged friction between the pair that had prompted Duerr to consider leaving 
him, Riverside County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan C. Lough said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The heated argument appears to have turned deadly, Lough said, when Duerr was 
stabbed to death in the garage of her apartment building at the hands of 
Spontak and another man. 
</P>
<P>
The first suggestion of a motive in the killing came as Spontak, 22, and 
Cameron Seaholm, 22, a high school friend of Spontak and Duerr who had been 
staying with them, were arraigned Monday in Riverside County Municipal Court in 
Corona. Both are charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Both pleaded not guilty. A preliminary hearing was scheduled in June. 
</P>
<P>
"My client, Mr. Spontak, has maintained his innocence and is shocked by this 
situation. He has absolutely no idea how his girlfriend was killed," said 
defense attorney Thomas L. Brown of Westminster after the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm has told officers that he stole Duerr's car, but that only after he had 
a flat tire did he discover her body in the trunk, police said. They said 
Seaholm has told them that he did dump the body in a remote area near Corona, 
insisting he had nothing to do with the killing. "It appears that both of the 
defendants were clearly involved in the murder itself -- not just in a 
cover-up, as Mr. Seaholm claims," Lough said Monday. Investigators, basing 
their conclusions on the reports of witnesses, believe that Duerr returned home 
on Sunday night, April 16, found cocaine in the apartment, and became upset 
with Spontak, Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a dispute about drugs being present in the apartment. As far as we 
know, there was no violent altercation then . . . but it appears that she was 
killed later that night or early the next morning in the garage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duerr was stabbed 20 times, perhaps with an ice pick, investigators have said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Seaholm has told them that on the weekend of the killing, he and 
Spontak had a quarter-kilo (about half a pound) of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys for both Spontak and Seaholm said they have seen no 
evidence linking the killing to an argument over drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Told of the prosecutor's comments, Brown said that Spontak and Duerr "seem to 
have been getting along pretty well (in the period preceding the killing). The 
prosecutor is really reaching awfully hard for a motive on this one." 
</P>
<P>
And Brown, noting that Duerr and Spontak had been dating off and on for the 
last 6 years, added: "Even if he were a drug dealer -- and I'm certainly not 
saying he is -- it seems that she would have known that a long time ago -- not 
just 2 weeks ago."

TRIPLETS' BIRTH MARKED BY USE OF NEW PROCEDURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine computer operator Linda Nielsen helped make medical history Sunday 
evening when she gave birth to triplets. 
</P>
<P>
The baby girls, Jennifer Ann, Christina Marie and Katherine Michelle, were 
diagnosed as healthy at only 9 weeks' gestation in an experimental diagnostic 
technique called chorionic villus sampling, which was used for the first time 
on the West Coast in Neilsen's case, according to their obstetrician, Arthur I. 
Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
In the procedure, doctors removed a small sample of tissue from the membrane 
surrounding each of of the three fetuses, and 2 weeks later, Nielsen learned 
her babies did not have Down's syndrome or other genetic defects. The procedure 
is expected to replace amniocentesis, a procedure that is performed much later 
-- at 16 weeks' gestation. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, the babies were reported "doing well" in the special care 
nursery at St. Joseph Hospital, spokesman Dennis Gaschen said. The babies -- 
still called Baby A, B and C because the Nielsens had not decided which name to 
give which child -- were born by Caesarian section at 6:13, 6:14 and 6:15 p.m. 
Sunday, Gaschen said. 
</P>
<P>
Baby A weighed 4 pounds, 8 ounces and was l7 1/2 inches long; Baby B was 4 
pounds, 6 ounces and l7 1/2 inches long, and Baby C was 3 pounds, 13 ounces and 
17 1/2 inches long.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDEN GROVE;

<P>
CHILDREN WITH MATCHES BLAMED FOR HOME FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two 5-year-old children playing with matches Monday morning ignited a fire that 
gutted a home in the 12900 block of Twintree Avenue, officials said. No one was 
injured in the blaze, which caused an estimated $110,000 in damage to the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Left homeless by the blaze were at least 5 people, including the youngsters 
living in the home, Garden Grove Fire Department Battalion Chief Marvin 
Schilling said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross was providing shelter for 
the family, whose name Schilling said was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was not known how the children escaped the burning home, which is 
owned by Rosie Magvaleno. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 8:50 a.m. and began in what Schilling described as a 
"lean-to" that appeared to have been added to the house. Schilling said it was 
not clear how many people actually lived in the home because several "cousins, 
daughters and granddaughters" often visited. 
</P>
<P>
The children were counseled by members of the Fire Department about the dangers 
of playing with matches and fire, Schilling said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the blaze caused an estimated $100,000 damage to the house, and $10,000 
to contents.

<P>
CAR DEALER WILL SETTLE CHARGES FOR $122,910 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A local car dealership has agreed to pay $122,910 to settle charges that it 
misrepresented the histories of some of its used cars, the Orange County 
district attorney's office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Lincoln Mercury, while agreeing to pay fines, restitution and the 
cost of investigation in the case, denied any wrongdoing in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Motor Vehicles investigators charged that the dealer bought used 
cars at auction from such companies as Hertz and Avis, then falsely sold them 
to unsuspecting buyers as "executive cars, cars previously owned by private 
parties, or cars just used around the dealership." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, the Lincoln Mercury dealer also has agreed to a 
permanent injunction requiring it to give all buyers written notice of the 
histories of its used vehicles.

ESCAPEE FLEES IN CAR AFTER ASKING SALESMAN TO CHANGE PLACES; HE'S CAUGHT AFTER 
CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A prison escapee talked a salesman out of a new Corvette convertible while on a 
test drive Monday and led police on a chase through three cities before he was 
captured trying to run into a Costa Mesa office building, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the man was captured, the Corvette was involved in three separate 
collisions involving a total of four cars, but no one was injured, Newport 
Beach police said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of grand theft, auto, was James Robert Hruby, 22, who was 
wanted on an arrest warrant for a recent escape from the state prison at Chino, 
Newport Beach Police Lt. Don Chandler said. He said Hruby's driver's license 
indicated that he lived in Mission Viejo before he was sentenced to 2 years in 
state prison on conviction of multiple counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Because syringes and insulin were found on Hruby and he claimed to be a 
diabetic, officers transferred him to the Orange County Jail, where he was 
being held in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
According to Chandler, a man posing as a customer drove a Corvette out of 
MacPherson Chevrolet in Irvine about 4 p.m. with a salesman riding along. A 
short time later, the customer asked the salesman to drive because his foot 
hurt. When the salesman got out of the Corvette to change places, Chandler 
said, the suspect sped away. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't use force or a gun. He just faked the salesman out of the car," 
Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Officer Kirk Jacobi, who had heard a description of the 
stolen Corvette broadcast over his police radio, first spotted the car on Coast 
Highway near the Rusty Pelican restaurant and followed it while he 
double-checked the suspect's physical description: long, curly blond hair tied 
in a pony tail. The car had paper dealer plates. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobi, a rookie in his first week on patrol, turned on his lights and siren on 
Brookhurst Street just north of the highway, but the driver sped away, Chandler 
said. A Costa Mesa police helicopter entered the chase and officers from 
various cities joined in as its driver traveled back and forth through 
Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was caught, the suspect drove the wrong way on Newport Boulevard, ran 
into four cars and also banged up both sides of the white Corvette as officers 
chased him for 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen Corvette first collided with a car at Adams Avenue and Mesa Verde 
Drive, then hit another car at a filling station at Harbor Boulevard and Adams 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:10 p.m., at the corner of Harbor Boulevard and Sunflower Avenue, the 
Corvette's driver careened into two cars in the parking lot at Digital 
Equipment Corp., where police said the suspect jumped out and tried to run 
inside the office. But employees kept the suspect out by holding the door shut, 
and officers who arrived moments later handcuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
The Corvette had a flat right-front tire and damage to a fender. Police did not 
know exactly how many miles the chase covered, but the Corvette's odometer read 
163 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at MacPherson Chevrolet declined to discuss the theft and would only 
estimate the Corvette's value at $35,000 to $40,000.

REDINGTON PASSES THE TENNIS TEST; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER ESPERANZA STAR KEEPS IMPROVING AT THIRD BASE 
</P>

<P>
The days of tennis balls are past for Tom Redington, former Esperanza High 
School star. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, while playing at Sumter, S.C., the Atlanta Braves' Class-A 
affiliate, Redington underwent an intensive training program to improve his 
fielding skills at third base. 
</P>
<P>
Ned Yost, Sumter coach and a former major league catcher, would hit a barrage 
of tennis balls at Redington to sharpen his reaction time. 
</P>
<P>
Yost would stand about 25 to 30 feet away and hit smashes Andre Agassi would be 
proud of. He hit tennis balls instead of baseballs to prevent bruising 
Redington, whose mission was to stop the balls at all cost, even if it meant 
flopping around like a hockey goalie. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed ridiculous," Redington said. "(But) I was having trouble fielding. I 
think I let my hitting affect my fielding." 
</P>
<P>
If that was the case, then the fielding drills were clearly necessary because 
Redington, in his first full season in professional baseball, hit just .195 
with 11 home runs and 58 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
He had finished his high school career with a .399 career average, 22 home runs 
and a wealth of postseason accolades, including Times' Orange County player of 
the year honors as a senior in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
This season Redington has moved on to the Braves' Class-A team at Burlington, 
Iowa, leaving the tennis balls and his hitting troubles far behind. 
</P>
<P>
After his high school career as shortstop at Esperanza and a little more than a 
season of adjustment in the Braves' farm system, Redington has -- with a great 
deal of relief -- become an accomplished third baseman. In 21 games so far this 
season, Redington is batting .293 with six homers and 17 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Why the improvement? 
</P>
<P>
First of all, Redington doesn't think the turnaround has been that dramatic. He 
points out that he hit .300 with four homers in the final month of the 1988 
season. Redington also thinks the sessions with the tennis balls helped 
greatly, but maturity and a season's worth of experience have been the most 
significant factors. 
</P>
<P>
He has settled into the routine of a professional baseball player. He sleeps in 
late most mornings, runs errands, then returns to his apartment to catch "Days 
of Our Lives" or a Chicago Cubs game on TV. Then it's time to gear up for the 
evening's game. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, getting motivated for each game proved to be as difficult as 
learning his new position. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always easy in high school," Redington said. "Here, it's hard to get 
yourself pumped up. Of course, there are days you don't want to be there. 
That's natural." 
</P>
<P>
So, Redington said, he tries to maintain an even keel, and it seems to be 
paying off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been pretty enjoyable," he said. "I'm a lot more comfortable. It's almost 
like I was back in high school. The pitchers (out of respect for his hitting 
skills) are throwing me a lot of curveballs and trying to make me chase pitches 
I don't want to swing at." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the Braves' organization, which has shown a commitment to youth in 
recent seasons, also has helped to boost Redington's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pitcher or an outfielder in the Mets' organization, you have to 
ask yourself, 'Where am I going to play?' " Redington said. "Most likely, 
you're not going up (to the big club) or you're going to get traded. 
</P>
<P>
"(Atlanta) really isn't all that stable at third base right now." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Gant, the Braves' starting third baseman, is hitting just .173 this season. 
He has struggled after being moved from second base, where he played his rookie 
year. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Redington is making the most of his opportunity at Burlington, even if 
it isn't the most attractive place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only town I've been in where I look forward to the road trips," he 
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Angel update: Mike Fetters, a former Pepperdine pitcher and one of the Angels' 
bright prospects, didn't get the call when the team added a pitcher to the 
roster Monday to take infielder Mark McLemore's spot. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Angels brought up Rich Monteleone, who had a 1-3 record with a 
3.82 earned-run average in five appearances with triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Fetters, a 24-year-old right-hander, could very well get a chance with the big 
club later this season, however. He had progressed rapidly since joining the 
organization in 1986. He is 2-2 with a 4.13 ERA in four starts with the 
Trappers this season. 
</P>
<P>
He split time between double-A Midland, Tex., and Edmonton last season. At 
Midland, he compiled an 8-8 record with a 5.92 ERA in 20 starts. He was 2-0 
with a 1.93 ERA in two starts with Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Meacham, who was released by the New York Yankees before the season began 
as part of the team's ongoing overhaul, has hooked on with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates' organization. 
</P>
<P>
Meacham, a former infielder at Mater Dei High School and San Diego State, has 
been assigned to the Pirates' triple-A affiliate at Buffalo. A shortstop, 
Meacham is batting .121 in 33 at-bats since signing April 5. 
</P>
<P>
He spent six seasons with the Yankees' organization and seemed to have a 
confirmed seat on the Columbus shuttle, moving frequently from the big club to 
the team's triple-A team in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
His best season with the Yankees was 1987 when he hit .271 in 77 games. He also 
spent 40 games at Columbus, hitting .273. 
</P>
<P>
New place, same result: Bob Hamelin, who tore up the Northwest League last 
season at Eugene, Ore., has moved up in the Kansas City Royals' organization. 
He hit .298 with 17 homers and 61 RBIs in the Class-A Emeralds' short-season 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Hamelin, who was the Southern California community college player of the year 
at Rancho Santiago College, is at double-A Memphis this season. 
</P>
<P>
In 23 games, the first baseman is hitting .304 with six homers and 10 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Add sluggers: Keith Kaub, a former Los Alamitos, Golden West and Cal State 
Fullerton first baseman, is batting .409 with two homers and seven RBIs in 
eight games for Rockford, Ill., the Expos' Class-A team. 
</P>
<P>
Kaub hit .344 with 20 homers and 59 RBIs last season as Fullerton reached the 
semifinals of the College World Series.

<P>
Orange Coast and Golden West colleges, less than 10 miles apart, will travel 
close to 500 miles to most likely decide the state women's swimming title this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast, which had won four consecutive state titles before finishing 
second to Diablo Valley last season, is back as the favorite. Golden West and 
Diablo Valley figure to be the only two teams strong enough to challenge OCC. 
</P>
<P>
The meet starts Thursday and continues through Saturday at Diablo Valley 
College in Pleasant Hill, near Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast has qualified seven swimmers, four divers and four relay teams. 
Golden West has 10 swimmers and four relay teams, but no divers. 
</P>
<P>
OCC is led by Patti Reed, Karen Paulitschek, and Erika Reetz. Reed has the best 
time in the state in the 500-yard freestyle (5:05.01.) She also will be in the 
200 freestyle and the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Paulitschek will swim the 500 freestyle, 50 butterfly and 100 butterfly. Reetz 
will be in the 500, 200 and 100 freestyles. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West is led by three sophomores, each of whom qualified for three events 
after qualifying for three last season. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Takayama will be in the 100 individual medley and the 50 and 100 
butterfly. Carolyn Bentley will swim the 100 individual medley, 50 breaststroke 
and 100 breaststroke. Cristi Hugh qualified for the 500 freestyle, 200 
individual medley and the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
This will mark the second time this season that OCC and Golden West have faced 
each other. OCC, which won the Orange Empire Conference, won the Cuesta 
Invitational title in March. Golden West, which won the South Coast Conference, 
finished second and Diablo Valley third at Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
But Golden West Coach Jem McAdams thinks his team still could challenge OCC. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so much room for improvement from Cuesta that it's exciting," McAdams 
said. "We have a chance to really do some things well and be right there." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis regionals: Saddleback, the top-seeded men's team, plays MiraCosta today 
at 2 p.m. at Rancho San Clemente in the first round of the Southern California 
dual-team championships. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast plays Grossmont at MiraCosta College in another first-round match, 
also at 2 p.m. today. San Diego Mesa plays Santa Barbara City, and Long Beach 
plays College of the Desert in the other first-round matches today. The 
semifinal round is Monday. The Southern California Regional championship is May 
10 at Mt. San Antonio College. The Southern California individual regional 
tournament is at Mt. SAC May 11-13. 
</P>
<P>
The state tournament is at West Valley College May 17-20. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback baseball: Saddleback is in motion to hire a full-time baseball coach 
by the end of spring. Jim Brideweser took over the program again this season 
after coaching from 1982-85, but had to step down for medical reasons a month 
ago. Brideweser planned to coach this season only. 
</P>
<P>
Assistants Rich Rommel and Charlie Phillips have been running the team since 
Brideweser stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback Athletic Director Bill Otta, who will head the search committee, 
said there were close to 40 applicants. The committee will start interviewing 
soon after the regular season ends on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reach will be returning to the Rancho Santiago baseball program as an 
assistant coach, the college's sports information department announced Monday. 
Reach was baseball coach from 1975 to 1981 and compiled a 151-92 record. 
</P>
<P>
He then took over the softball program from 1982 to 1987. Reach's softball 
teams had a record of 189-54 and won back-to-back state titles in 1985 and 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Reach will be joining the staff of Don Sneddon, who replaced him in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Willie Barber has to be the hard-luck pitcher of the year. Barber, 
a sophomore right-hander, is 3-10, but has a very respectable earned-run 
average of 3.52. Fullerton has scored 25 runs in his 10 losses and no more than 
five runs in any game. . . . Rancho Santiago shortstop Tim Reynolds has signed 
a letter of intent to play at Chapman next season. Reynolds, who also has 
played second and third base, is hitting .423. . . . Cypress pitcher Rich 
Lodding has made a verbal commitment to play at Pepperdine. . . . Cypress 
softball pitcher Colleen Moore has signed a letter of intent to play at Cal 
State Long Beach. Moore, who is 21-7, helped Cypress to a second-place finish 
behind Fullerton in the Orange Empire Conference this season . . . Vicky Silva, 
who averaged 24 points and 8.6 rebounds for the Cypress women's basketball team 
this season, has made a verbal commitment to play at Cal State Los Angeles next 
fall.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;

<P>
PARSONS FINDS A HOME AS CATCHER FOR LA QUINTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jason Parsons of La Quinta High School can hit. There seems to be no question 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, The Times' athlete of the week, is batting .434 with nine home runs 
and 32 runs batted in. Last week he had three home runs and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
So Parsons can hit. What no one was really sure of was what position he could 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouts and college recruiters think he may be the best hitter in the county," 
La Quinta Coach Dave Demarest said. "They just weren't sure where they could 
put him." 
</P>
<P>
But this season, Parsons believes he has found a home, which is located behind 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I played catcher in the Area Code games last summer, and the coaches up there 
thought it was my best position," Parsons said. "They told Coach Demarest." 
</P>
<P>
Demarest was happy to hear it, considering the fact that both his catchers 
graduated last June. 
</P>
<P>
"We were glad to finally find a spot for Jason," Demarest said. "He could play 
first base, but we had an all-league player (Bob Heyl) returning at that 
position. I feel that catcher is Jason's future. He'll be a good one." 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, who played outfield as a junior, enjoys his new job. He has the arm 
strength to play the position and he's learning the do's and don'ts as he goes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still just getting the basics down," Parsons said. "The footwork is the 
toughest. But I really like it. You can control the game. And I don't exactly 
have the speed to play the outfield." 
</P>
<P>
And playing catcher also has helped Parsons' hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get an idea on each umpire's strike zone, so the next time you hit you 
can be more selective," Parsons said. "You can also learn a hitter's weakness." 
</P>
<P>
Parsons knows about weaknesses. He admits that his is being a perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I should get a hit every time up," Parsons said. "I know it's not 
possible, but that's what I strive for." 
</P>
<P>
Parsons hasn't been perfect, but a .434 batting average isn't that far off. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hard .434; there aren't any bloopers in that," Demarest said. "Once 
he learns that failure is part of the game and stops trying to be perfect, then 
he's going to be really dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Brett Grebe of Westminster was five for eight with three RBIs last week. He 
also was 2-0 as a pitcher with 15 strikeouts in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Folsom of San Clemente had five RBIs, including a three-run homer, in a 
13-6 victory over El Toro Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Nietzke of Capistrano Valley was six for seven, with three runs scored, 
three RBIs, a home run, two doubles and two steals in two games last week. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Montera of Kennedy set a school record with 13 strikeouts in a 3-2 victory 
over Santiago Wednesday. Montera also hit a solo home run in the seventh to win 
the game.

Odetics Inc., an Anaheim technology company, is having a difficult time 
persuading a small New York firm to accept its unsolicited buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Odetics offered to purchase Ithaco Inc., a maker of attitude 
control devices for spacecraft, for $6 per share, or $1.8 million. But Ithaco's 
board of directors has snubbed the offer. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Odetics said it has extended until May 31 the offer to purchase all 
or part of Ithaco's stock, which is held by a relatively small group of 
investors. The offer was originally set to expire Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked to the company about getting together, and they said they didn't 
want to do that," said Jim Pipp, Odetics' controller. "We have had some 
communication with them. I wouldn't say we're in any kind of dispute or fight 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, at least, call it a standoff.

JUST 15% OF FAMILIES COULD AFFORD MEDIAN-PRICED HOME HERE IN MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only 15% of the families in Orange County could afford a median-priced house in 
March, the same as February, while the statewide rate fell to a 5-year low of 
18%. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County rate was down from 26% in March, 1988, about the time when 
home prices began to climb dramatically, the California Assn. of Realtors 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Income of $77,822 Needed 
</P>
<P>
To afford a $238,807 house -- the median price for a detached, single-family, 
resale residence in March -- an Orange County family needed an income of 
$77,822 to make monthly payments of $1,946. 
</P>
<P>
The association's estimates are based on resales of homes listed by brokers. 
They assume that buyers will make a standard 20% down payment, allocate 30% of 
their monthly income to house payments and take out a mortgage at prevailing 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The interest rate used to calculate the payment is an average of fixed- and 
adjustable-rate mortgages. That average was 9.96% in March, the highest since 
September, 1986. A year ago, the median price of a resale home in Orange County 
was $191,191. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's 15% affordability rate was not the lowest: In the San Francisco 
Bay Area, with a median home price of $249,508 in March, only 11% of families 
could afford a house. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, only 16% could afford the median home price of $210,029. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide figure of 18%, is the lowest percentage since the trade 
association began keeping track in 1984. March's figure was down from 19% in 
February and 25% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Condominiums -- which dropped slightly in price statewide -- were slightly more 
affordable last month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Median-Priced Condo 
</P>
<P>
The median-priced condo was $132,850 in March, and 34% of families in metro 
areas could afford to buy one, up from 33% in February. At the median price, a 
family needed an income of $43,300 to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
No condominium figures were available for separate markets such as Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFFORDABILITY INDEX FOR EXISTING HOMES 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of Orange County households could afford to buy the 
median-priced resale home in the county in March, unchanged from the February 
percentage. In March, 1988, 26% of county households could afford the 
median-priced home.

EX-NORTHROP ENGINEER FROM YORBA LINDA PLEADS GUILTY IN JUMP JET CONSPIRACY CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Northrop Corp. engineer from Yorba Linda pleaded guilty Monday to 
participating in a defense fraud conspiracy and admitted that he helped fake 
test results on key stabilization systems for the Navy's AV-8 Harrier jump jet. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Hyde, 48, who was a senior engineer in an arm of Northrop's Precision 
Products Division in the San Gabriel Valley, acknowledged in federal court that 
he helped falsify vibration test results for 189 rate sensor assemblies that 
Northrop made for the Harrier fighter-bombers, which were built by 
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The government paid $1.6 million for the rate sensor assemblies to stabilize 
the jet, which can take off and land vertically like a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde, who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United 
States and two counts of making false statements to the government, faces up to 
15 years in prison and a $750,000 fine when he is sentenced by U.S. District 
Judge Pamela Rymer on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde was one of five current or former Northrop workers named in a 167-count 
indictment handed down last month by a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Marshall Schulman said after the hearing that Hyde pleaded 
guilty because the government has "overwhelming evidence" against him. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very contrite and feels bad about the whole situation and is accepting 
his responsibility," Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde worked at the Western Services Department until August, 1987. The 
department, located in El Monte and later in Pomona, was closed in late 1987 
after reports about the faked tests became public.

President Bush today called for all U.S. allies to condemn anticipated massive 
election fraud in Panama, where the Administration predicts Manuel Antonio 
Noriega will steal Sunday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
"All nations that value democracy -- that understand free and fair elections 
are the very heart of their democratic system -- should speak out against 
election fraud in Panama," Bush said in remarks to the Council of the Americas, 
an organization of business people. "That means the democracies of Europe, as 
well as nations in this hemisphere struggling to preserve the democratic 
systems they've fought so hard to put in place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Noriega Rhetoric 
</P>
<P>
Bush continued to step up the Administration's anti-Noriega rhetoric as the 
Panamanian election nears. He repeated his promise that the United States "will 
not recognize the results of a fraudulent election engineered to keep Noriega 
in power." 
</P>
<P>
The government, controlled by Noriega, is backing the general's close 
associate, Carlos Duque, for president. An opposition coalition is backing 
Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said it took "great courage" for the opposition to enter the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"A free and fair vote in the elections," Bush said, would enable Panama "to 
take a significant step toward ending the international isolation and internal 
economic crisis brought on by the Noriega regime." 
</P>
<P>
But, added Bush, "It is evident that the regime is ready to resort to massive 
election fraud in order to remain in power." 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk accused the Noriega regime of altering 
voter lists, invalidating voter registration cards of opposition supporters and 
firing government workers opposed to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech touching on the economic, political and social situation throughout 
the hemisphere, the President also said that unless Nicaragua's leftist 
government changes the "ominous" actions leading to its elections next 
February, "it will be a tragic setback -- and a dangerous one. The 
consolidation of tyranny will not be peace. It will be a crisis waiting to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
The President blasted the election laws recently passed by the 
Sandinista-controlled National Assembly. He accused the Sandinistas of imposing 
a "stacked deck" against their opposition by unilaterally setting the rules, 
giving excessive enforcement powers to the Interior Ministry and barring 
private ownership of television stations. 
</P>
<P>
But he did not say whether he would accept the results of elections under the 
Sandinista rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid to Contras 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is supplying non-lethal aid to Nicaraguan rebels until 
the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also called for "a new partnership for the Americas." 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned cooperation against drug trafficking and efforts to ease the debt 
burden of Latin American governments, but the speech included no new 
initiatives or policies. 
</P>
<P>
He also renewed his demand that Moscow end its backing of left-wing subversion 
in Central America.

A man suspected of attempted rape was arrested when he set up a meeting with 
the victim to give her a small box containing a finger he had cut off to show 
his remorse, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested Yoon No Yoon, 31, of Los Angeles and booked him at the Parker 
Center jail on suspicion of attempted rape. The finger was booked at the county 
coroner's office as evidence. The victim, a 23-year-old woman who met the man 
in a college English class, reported the attempted rape to police April 19. She 
contacted police again Monday night to report that the suspect had called her 
to say he was sorry and wanted to meet her at a fast-food restaurant and give 
her a gift.

COUNCILMAN FERRARO'S SON ARRESTED IN FALSE EMERGENCY 911 PHONE CALLS

<P>
Gianni Lucke Ferraro, the 33-year-old son of Los Angeles City Council President 
John Ferraro, was arrested at his Studio City home after police said he had 
falsely reported emergencies on the 911 line, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Ferraro was released on his own recognizance this morning after 
being arrested on the misdemeanor count at about 11 p.m. Monday, Officer Bill 
Frio said. Police declined to specifically say what the calls were about or how 
many were placed. 
</P>
<P>
"Officers had been sent to investigate some emergency calls that Mr. Ferraro 
made regarding the conditions at his residence," Frio said. "They were personal 
matters. They were not emergencies. They believed that if he was left 
unattended that the emergency calls would continue so he was arrested for . . . 
false reporting of an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ferraro was sentenced to one year in County Jail and five years' 
probation in the April, 1987, vehicular manslaughter death of a pedestrian in 
Hollywood. Police said Ferraro struck a 69-year-old man while driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, a one-time radio reporter and producer, was also ordered to enroll in 
an alcohol rehabilitation program. According to court records, Ferraro had two 
previous drunk driving convictions, both in 1976.

TENTATIVE ACCORD REPORTED ON KARCHER INSIDE TRADING; 
</P>
<P>
ATTORNEYS TELL OF ONE 'HURDLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Carl N. Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, and 
six of his family members reached a tentative agreement today to settle 
allegations of illegal insider stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers and attorneys for the Securities and Exchange Commission said 
an unspecified "hurdle" still must be resolved before the agreement is final. 
But both sides said they are optimistic that the civil case would be settled by 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came on the same day that their trial was to begin in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Carl N. Karcher, 14 family members and a company employee were accused by the 
SEC in April, 1988, of avoiding losses of at least $310,000 in 1984 by selling 
Karcher securities before public disclosure of a 50% drop in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Karcher and his younger brother, company President Donald F. Karcher, and 
their wives were not accused of trading stock, but they were accused of tipping 
other family members, through a series of phone calls and discussions, about 
the expected drop in profits. 
</P>
<P>
Since the SEC suit was filed, allegations against many of the defendants have 
been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward J. Rafeedie issued a summary judgment in September 
against Carl Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, finding him guilty of insider 
trading. In February, Donald Karcher, his wife and four family members agreed 
to pay $187,560 in fines and penalties to end the case against them. And last 
month, the judge dismissed the government's civil case against Carl Karcher's 
wife, Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the latest settlement were not released, but it was said to require 
that the defendants repay money that the SEC alleges was gained through insider 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Carl N. Karcher, 72, was not in court today. His lawyer, Wesley G. Howell Jr., 
said he was on a Mediterranean cruise until Saturday but could be reached to 
discuss the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the case will be settled," Howell said, adding that his client 
sought a settlement because he "has come to appreciate the costs of trial." 
</P>
<P>
SEC attorney John C. Koutsos said the agreement must be approved by SEC 
commissioners in Washington, D.C. The Karcher family attorneys said they need 
to consult further with their clients. 
</P>
<P>
"There are conditions to be fulfilled," Howell said. "We don't have the 
approval from clients on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached after two hours of discussions in Rafeedie's chambers, 
provided for compromises on both sides. It did not give the SEC all the relief 
it sought. If the SEC had won at trial, it could have won an injunction against 
the defendants as well as orders requiring Carl Karcher to pay up to $996,000. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the six relatives could have been required to repay $332,000 in 
losses they avoided by trading on inside information, plus a penalty of three 
times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin A. DeShano, director of general accounting at Karcher Enterprises, was 
the only one of the civil case defendants to face criminal charges of 
securities fraud through insider trading. DeShano, 53, of Orange, will not 
stand trial for the civil charges until the related criminal case is resolved. 
His criminal trial is scheduled to start May 23.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans today to regulate 38 
contaminants in drinking water on grounds that they pose a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring to detect pollutant levels in the water system is likely to cost 
every household nationwide up to an extra $10 a year. The EPA estimated that it 
will cost 2,500 mostly small public water systems about $360 million to install 
equipment to lower the amount of pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The 38 pollutants added to EPA's list brought to 55 the number of contaminants 
for which the agency has set standards. 
</P>
<P>
Among those named today were asbestos, barium, styrene, mercury, chromium, 
selenium, aldicarb, chlordane and PCBs. Michael Cook, director of the EPA 
Office of Drinking Water, told a press conference that 2 million people will be 
affected by the new list, largely in the Southeast and upper Midwest and in 
farming areas where pesticide use is highest.

A truck carrying military explosives overturned on Interstate 20 just outside 
this West Texas town, and police closed the highway and briefly ordered 
evacuations before learning the explosives were not armed. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities said the truck carried 48 rocket pods containing 644 M-77 
anti-tank grenades and a quantity of rocket fuel, but there was no explosion 
and no fire. Explosives experts from Ft. Sill, Okla., and Ft. Hood, Tex., 
inspected the accident site and determined there was no danger, said officials 
at the scene from the state Department of Public Safety and Dyess Air Force 
Base. The authorities decided to have the explosives loaded onto trucks for 
transfer to Dyess, where they were to be examined further.

HUNGARY DISMANTLING IRON CURTAIN AT AUSTRIAN BORDER

<P>
Hungary today began dismantling a symbolic Iron Curtain that has divided Europe 
for four decades as it started to remove a barbed-wire fence on its border with 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
"With the dismantling of this barrier, an era with our relations with Western 
Europe and particularly Austria is closed," Interior Ministry official Andras 
Kovari told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old barbed-wire barrier replaced a mine field laid after the 
Communist takeover of Hungary in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The phrase "Iron Curtain" was coined by the late Winston Churchill, former 
British prime minister, in a 1946 speech discussing the dangers of Soviet 
expansionism. 
</P>
<P>
"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic," Churchill told an 
audience in Fulton, Mo., "an iron curtain has descended across the continent." 
</P>
<P>
Reformist Minister of State Imre Pozsgay said in October that the fence had 
become outdated historically, politically and technically. 
</P>
<P>
Dismantling began in the no-man's-land near this small town on the main road 
between Budapest and Vienna and at three other points, Koszeg, Sopron and 
Szentgotthard. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists watched as soldiers with sledgehammers disconnected the alarm 
system, lifted six-foot posts and rolled up wires.

Cambodian Premier Hun Sen invited resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk to 
return to his homeland as head of state in a dramatic bid today to end 
Cambodia's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been quite a lot of progress," said Hun Sen after five hours of new 
peace talks with his longtime rival. "We asked Prince Sihanouk to return home 
as the head of state and chairman of a supreme council to organize elections." 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk, head of a U.N.-recognized coalition of three rebel groups, said his 
answer will depend on further unspecified changes in Cambodia's constitution 
and whether Vietnam withdraws its 70,000 troops by Sept. 30, as promised.

Ronald D. Martin, vice president and executive editor of USA Today, was named 
today as editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, five months after the 
stormy exit of Bill Kovach. 
</P>
<P>
Martin will begin work at the Atlanta papers on Monday, said Publisher Jay 
Smith, who made the announcement. Arnold Rosenfeld, who has served as interim 
editor, will become editor-in-chief of Cox Newspapers, the parent company of 
the Atlanta papers, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld said Martin is a "very experienced newspaper person and one I have 
great respect for." 
</P>
<P>
Kovach, a former Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, resigned from 
the Atlanta newspapers last November after a dispute with management over 
control of the Cox chain's Washington bureau. His departure sparked an effort 
by admirers, including a march in downtown Atlanta, to get him back on the job.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney approved $13.4 million today for the increased 
use of National Guard troops in civilian anti-drug law enforcement efforts in 
36 additional states and U.S. territories. 
</P>
<P>
This raises the total number of National Guard anti-drug plans approved by 
Cheney to 48 states and U.S. territories at a cost of $25.2 million. On March 
30, Cheney approved $11.8 million for the plans of the first 12 states, 
including California. 
</P>
<P>
Congress authorized $300 million to the Pentagon this year to increase the 
military's involvement in the campaign against illegal drugs. At least $40 
million of that money has been set aside for use by the National Guard. The 
Guard generally will be used for detection and monitoring through aerial 
surveillance and photography, radar surveillance, assistance in searching 
containers and the transportation and training of law enforcement personnel.

PLO officials in Paris with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser 
Arafat initially said Salem was killed in the attack. But late in the day, 
Arafat told reporters he understood that Salem was in a coma in intensive care.

"We must not let ourselves be terrorized by this incident," Arafat said.

In Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, police said Salem was driving along 
Fakhreddin Street when masked gunmen raked his car with gunfire at 1:05 p.m. 
"Salem is wounded in the head. His chances of survival are very slim," a police

No one was injured in the accident aboard the Boeing 747. Airport officials

sabotage. The state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines jet was 20 minutes into its

BASIC CHANGES TO RESTORE COMPETITIVENESS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
MIT STUDY CALLS INDUSTRIAL WEAKNESS BIGGEST PERIL TO LIVING STANDARD, SECURITY

Restoring U.S. competitiveness demands grass-roots changes by companies, labor 
unions, schools and workers, concludes a two-year MIT study released today. 
</P>
<P>
While government has a role to play, changes that come from the bottom up are 
essential to improving the nation's lagging rate of productivity growth, says 
the study by scientists, engineers and economists at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
The report, called "Made in America," pegs weakness in American industry as the 
biggest threat to the nation's standard of living and security. 
</P>
<P>
"To live well, a nation must produce well," said the study, which is being 
released as a 344-page hard-cover book. 
</P>
<P>
The study differs from many others in that it does not focus on such economic 
issues as the high cost of capital in the United States and the shortage of 
national savings. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it focuses on what it calls an excessive concern with short-term 
profits; outdated corporate strategies that focus too much on mass production 
and the domestic American market; and lack of cooperation within and among U.S. 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
It also blames neglect of people, technological failures in translating 
discoveries into products, and unwise public policies. 
</P>
<P>
For industry, the main recommendation is to focus on steady, continuous 
improvements in the production process. That involves meeting customers' 
demands for higher quality, faster delivery and more custom-tailoring. 
</P>
<P>
To hurry things along, companies should go to work on designing products and 
the processes for making them before the research and development is even 
complete, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
Companies should cultivate a work force that is more involved in the company's 
welfare, less specialized and continuously learning, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
But it also says traditional labor-union stands on work rules, job security and 
compensation "need to be revised to fit a world of changing technologies, 
international competition and a more educated work force."

The Murphy bed, the fold-into-the-wall sleeping convenience, today joined 
aspirin, cellophane and the escalator in the list of brand names that have 
become generic. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that any bed that folds into 
a closet can be called a Murphy bed. In doing so, the panel rejected a 
lower-court ruling on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
However, it upheld an unfair competition ruling against Interior Sleep Systems 
Inc. doing business as the Murphy Bed Co. of America Inc. in Florida and 
Georgia. The court said Interior could not call its own wall beds "originals." 
It ruled that Interior must pay Murphy Door Bed Co. of Amityville $825,000 in 
damages, saying use of the term "original" amounted to unfair competition.

POSTAL SERVICE REVENUES RUN SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS, POSTMASTER GENERAL SAYS

<P>
The Postal Service is facing a financial crunch, with revenues running short of 
what was expected following last year's rate increase, Postmaster General 
Anthony M. Frank said today. 
</P>
<P>
The mail service still expects to finish this fiscal year in the black, but 
with a significantly smaller margin than had been planned, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank told the agency's governing board that changes must be made to hold down 
costs and improve revenues. 
</P>
<P>
So far in the fiscal year, which began in October, the Postal Service took in 
$18.5 billion and spent $17.6 billion, leaving net revenues of $847 million, 
reported Senior Assistant Postmaster General Comer S. Coppie. 
</P>
<P>
That was $104 million less than expected in the wake of the postal rate 
increase that took effect in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Mailers Switched 
</P>
<P>
Because it is required by law to break even over the long run, the Postal 
Service counts on showing a surplus in the period right after a rate hike, in 
order to balance losses which will occur as its costs rise. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, rate hikes have come every three years, and Frank has said he hopes to 
maintain that cycle, with the next increase in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Income has been less than expected because of changes in the "mix" of mail, 
Coppie said. In other words, many large mailers have switched from more costly 
first-class mail to the pre-sorted first or third class, which costs them less 
and brings in less revenue for the post office. 
</P>
<P>
While managers expected some of this switch, it has occurred faster than they 
expected with the resulting decline in revenue, Coppie said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, continuing efforts to cut costs have not been as successful 
as had been hoped for, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressing Automation 
</P>
<P>
Frank told the postal Board of Governors that he is continuing to press forward 
with automation of the postal system as a means of cutting costs and speeding 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, he is trying to improve employee relations and is looking for 
ways to broaden product lines and make prices more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service cannot change its domestic rates without seeking approval 
from the independent Postal Rate Commission.

A Panamanian cargo ship carrying 913 new Toyota and Nissan cars collided with a 
Chinese tanker and sank in the Seto Inland Sea off western Japan this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The 7,628-ton auto carrier Orange Coral collided with the 2,785-ton Shamrock 
Ocho 4 miles off western Japan in a dense fog. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 South Korean crewmen on the cargo ship were rescued by a nearby ship, 
but it will be more than a week before salvage crews can raise the vessel, a 
spokesman for the Maritime Safety Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars will be returned to the car companies, but there is no hope they can 
be used again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese tanker was damaged, but its cargo of light oil did not leak.

Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan continued its financial slide in the first 
quarter with profits of $178,000, compared with $1.4 million the same time last 
year, the Van Nuys-based thrift said. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Acceptance, the S&amp;L's loss-ridden subsidiary that provides mobile 
home loans, lost $3.8 million in the first quarter, the company reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal lost $3 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Allewaert, chief operating officer, told shareholders at their meeting 
last week that the thrift is being hurt by the recent rise in interest rates.

The Indianapolis Colts announced the signing today of first-round draft pick 
Andre Rison, just nine days after the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Rison, the 22nd pick overall in the April 23 draft, is a 5-foot, 10-inch, 
185-pound wide receiver out of Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
He left Michigan State as the school's all-time leader with 146 catches for

The Philadelphia Eagles have offered Reggie White a contract that would make 
him the highest paid defensive player in the game, according to club President 
Harry T. Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble said Monday that club officials probably will meet in the next two days 
with White, considered by many the best defensive player in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"(The offer) doesn't necessarily mean we will bring this thing to fruition," 
Gamble said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Smith of the Buffalo Bills signed the highest contract for a defensive 
player to date in March: $1.7 million a year. White received $400,000 last 
year. He was not at home Monday night to comment on Gamble's offer. 
</P>
<P>
White steadfastly has maintained that unless he gets a new contract that makes 
him the highest paid defensive player in the NFL, he will sit out the season. 
Before Gamble's announcement, White's agent, Jimmy Sexton, said White will miss 
the mini-camp that begins today.

There are clues if you look for them. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Valenzuela arrived Monday, five days before the Kentucky Derby. He is 
here to ride Sunday Silence, the West Coast colt who will be second choice to 
the Phipps family's entry of Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring. He's here to 
familiarize himself with the Churchill Downs racing strip, but five days is 
awfully early. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there are interviews with trainer Charlie Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
Each one includes some variation of the statement, "If Easy Goer isn't a wonder 
horse, he's in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Whittingham upgraded Sunday Silence's standing. "Any horse that beats 
this horse (Sunday Silence) wins the race." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence showed how good he could be when he won the Santa Anita Derby by 
11 lengths. Before that, he won the San Felipe Handicap by 1 3/4 lengths. He 
has lost twice. The first was by a neck in his debut and the second was by a 
head to Houston, who is in the Derby but has not run well recently. 
</P>
<P>
A clue as to how high Whittingham regards Sunday Silence came last fall. While 
most of the racing world was settling in at Churchill Downs for the Breeders' 
Cup, Whittingham was trying to get back to Hollywood Park to see the colt win a 
maiden race. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham had several good horses in million-dollar races, but instead he was 
thinking about a 2-year-old maiden back home. 
</P>
<P>
The colt is by Halo from a mare named Wishing Well. It has overcome a troubled 
childhood to become a star. 
</P>
<P>
Plain and simple, no one wanted the colt. Arthur Hancock of Stone Farm in 
Paris, Ky., wound up owning and racing him almost by default. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a weedy horse," said Hancock. "He reminded you of a skinny teen-ager." 
</P>
<P>
When Sunday Silence and Houston first raced, in a 6 1/2-furlong allowance at 
Hollywood Park last December, Whittingham told trainer Wayne Lukas in the 
paddock, "If I'm ever going to beat you, it'll have to be today." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence led until the last few strides before Houston won at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
And there was then no doubt: Both colts were headed for the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Houston won the Bay Shore so impressively that when he 
returned to Santa Anita for that track's Derby, he was favored. But he dropped 
out of contention after a half-mile. Sunday Silence moved into a top spot. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence won't be favored Saturday. Easy Goer deserves that title. He 
probably will go off at odds of 1-2 or less. If he is bet down to less than 
2-5, he would be the shortest-priced favorite in modern times of the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
But Easy Goer still needs to win on the track. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham won his first Derby with Ferdinand in 1986. Three years later, he 
thinks he has another winner.
