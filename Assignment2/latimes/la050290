After two days of patrolling, the city's Fashion Police have dished out seven 
citations to grubby taxi drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Verboten clothing spotted by the Transportation Department's inspectors 
included white socks, jeans, white pants, striped shirts and one pea-green 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Joel Wachs, sponsor of the dress-code ordinance, joined in a 
stake-out by the Bonaventure Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have tried to do," he said, "is make sure that cab drivers are clean 
and neat, and that they don't have objectionable odors." 
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy. The city has 4,000 cabbies and 15 inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell -- the man who develops a 
much-publicized worst-dressed list -- welcomed the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel socks should be worn," he said. "I don't think you should wear open 
shoes in a cab. I don't think T-shirts should be worn." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like cabbies rank even lower than Cher on Blackwell's list. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago, the campaign manager of L.A. County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner 
proudly disclosed that he calls his boss the Silver Eagle -- because of "his 
silver hair and steady eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general candidate nearly picked up a new nickname, Wrong-Way 
Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner recently boarded a jet at LAX to fly to Sacramento but, after taking his 
seat, overheard a passenger remark that the flight would take 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner launched an immediate investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He soon uncovered the fact that this plane was headed for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The Silver Eagle flew the coop before the takeoff. But the Sacramento-bound 
plane, which had been parked next door, was gone. So he caught a later flight. 
</P>
<P>
An aide later told one reporter: "I think we've all made similar mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gubernatorial candidate John K. Van de Kamp, in his appeal for 
Latino votes, may not have been helped by a sign on Broadway that tried to link 
him with the Cinco de Mayo celebration. It read: "Cinco de Maya." 
</P>
<P>
Oy vey. 
</P>
<P>
The defense in the alleged voice-theft case of singer Tom Waits gave a 
mini-Louis Armstrong concert in federal court Tuesday, trying to show a 
similarity between Waits' and Armstrong's voices. 
</P>
<P>
Waits contends in a lawsuit that Frito-Lay Inc. imitated his voice in its corn 
chip commercials. 
</P>
<P>
When the defense announced it wanted to play Armstrong's version of "Hello 
Dolly" after playing three other Armstrong recordings, Waits' attorney 
objected. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Dist. Judge James Ideman overruled him, noting: "A little more Satchmo 
can't hurt anybody." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't get much more exciting in L.A. than it was Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
McGruff, the canine star of the "take-a-bite-out-of-crime" ads for the National 
Crime Prevention Council, was celebrating his 10th birthday at the L.A. 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Captain Hydro, the red-caped, blue-suited mascot of the Department 
of Water and Power, was visiting City Hall to promote water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
And, Billy and the Recyclones received a scroll from Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
and crooned their waste-management hit, "Do the Recycle": 
</P>
<P>
You do the bottle bop bop bop bop. 
</P>
<P>
 You do the can can can. 
</P>
<P>
 You do the bundle boogie. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the recycle....

<P>
 A positive example of trashy lyrics.

INITIATIVE DUEL VOWED ON SAN DIEGO GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: BUILDERS, SLOW-GROWTH ADVOCATES SQUARE OFF FOR ANOTHER BATTLE OVER 
THE CITY'S FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Setting the stage for another costly, bruising campaign on growth control, the 
San Diego 2000 Committee, a coalition of builders and civic leaders, announced 
Tuesday that it had submitted petitions to qualify its growth management 
initiative for the November ballot in both the city and county of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's slow-growth adversary, Prevent Los Angelization Now!, responded 
that it would revive its signature-gathering campaign to place a rival measure 
on the same ballot in the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups delayed their own ballot initiative drives begun late last year 
pending San Diego City Council deliberations on a separate growth management 
plan. On April 4, the council gave conceptual approval to a strict plan 
limiting construction while it embarks on a 20-year program of solving its 
deficiency in roads, parks, jails, police stations and other public services. 
</P>
<P>
Developers condemned the program as a sophisticated building cap and said it 
could shut down home construction in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Revival of the ballot initiative competition between the two organizations 
could mean another bitter electoral campaign like the 1988 battle that resulted 
in voter rejection of four growth-control measures on the November ballot. Two 
of those measures were sponsored by PLAN's predecessor, Citizens for Limited 
Growth. The council and the county Board of Supervisors also placed measures on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The building industry raised more than $2 million to defeat all four measures. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Tuesday night how passage of any of the initiatives would affect 
the ordinances being developed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego 2000 Committee, whose "Traffic Control and Comprehensive Growth 
Management Initiative" is largely a product of the building industry, said in a 
prepared statement that "our success in collecting 174,916 signatures shows 
that the people of San Diego strongly support San Diego 2000's comprehensive 
regional approach to relieving traffic congestion and managing growth." 
</P>
<P>
But Peter Navarro, chairman of PLAN, responded that the "building industry 
today declared war on the City Council, which is trying to adopt a sensible 
growth management plan." He said that the building industry is "attempting to 
once again divide and conquer the electorate with a phony initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor Maureen O'Connor, said that "if (both groups) 
want to go ahead and do that, every citizen has the right to file an 
initiative. But by the time we get to November, it's (O'Connor's) intention to 
have an ordinance on the books." 
</P>
<P>
By submitting its signatures Tuesday, San Diego 2000 fell within the 180-day 
time period allowed for collection of petitions to qualify an initiative for 
the ballot.

SUPERVISORS OPPOSE CREATION OF BORDER AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County supervisors Tuesday asked state Assembly members to drop consideration 
of a bill that would create a binational border authority with the power to 
undertake and finance projects that would bolster the quality of life along 
California's border with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, acting on a lengthy recommendation from county staff, asked 
state legislators to amend several parts of the controversial bill that 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) recently introduced. Supervisors 
suggested that the agency would needlessly duplicate functions now handled by 
other government bodies. 
</P>
<P>
However, Supervisors Brian Bilbray and George Bailey argued that San Diegans 
should use restraint in opposing the bill because it marks one of the first 
times that state legislators have considered the border as a problem for all of 
California, not just San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray, who acknowledged that portions of the bill are unacceptable, argued 
that supervisors should let Sacramento know that the county appreciates any 
state action that acknowledges "border problems are state problems." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just concerned that every time someone starts to address the (border) 
issue we don't (respond) by attacking," Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to recognize that the state is looking at the border," said Bailey, 
who cautioned that the county should not "shut the state out" of future 
projects along the border. 
</P>
<P>
The Polanco bill would use the power of state government to create a binational 
border authority to help pay for public projects, especially in debt-ridden 
Mexico. Polanco believes the bill is needed because regional and city 
governments on both sides of the border have failed to address myriad issues 
that are wrecking the border's environment and economy. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors argued Tuesday that the proposed agency would needlessly duplicate 
what the county and other local agencies already can do to build roads, sewers, 
water pipes and communications systems along the border. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray, however, suggested the county welcome state involvement, even though 
it might mean a "compromise" along the lines of the proposed "Big Pipe" sewer 
project, which calls for the use of state and federal funds that will be used 
to build a plant to treat sewage flowing from Tijuana to the ocean at Imperial 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
That proposed project is "frustrating" for residents of San Ysidro and Otay 
Mesa, Bilbray said, because it calls for construction of a sewage-treatment 
plant in the South Bay that would service Tijuana.

CITY MAY SUE TO RECOUP LOSSES FROM TROUBLED AIR SHOW ORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN and GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Diego will demand that Air/Space America re-pay about $250,000 
in debts from the 1988 aerial extravaganza at Brown Field and will file suit 
against the financially ailing organization if necessary, the City Council 
decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that there is little chance of ever recouping $100,000 in rent and an 
estimated $150,000 spent on repairs to Brown Field after the 1988 show, the San 
Diego City Council nevertheless voted unanimously in closed session to pursue 
the debts. 
</P>
<P>
"We assume that they don't have any money, but if they did, or if they are 
resuscitated in some form, we want to be on line," said Councilman Bob Filner, 
the council's most frequent critic of the air show's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for a second air show -- scheduled to begin two days from today -- 
collapsed April 18 when Air/Space America announced its cancellation because of 
financial and planning problems. 
</P>
<P>
The show's collapse threatened to initiate a new wave of lawsuits by companies 
that had contracted to perform services for Air/Space America. Nearly a dozen 
lawsuits were filed by unpaid creditors after the close of the debt-ridden 1988 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
Air/Space America founder Bob Wilson, a former Republican congressman from San 
Diego, blamed the "city of San Diego bureaucracy" for thwarting a last-ditch 
attempt to find financing for the 1990 show. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who spent more than $186,000 promoting the 1990 Air/Space 
America show -- money that the city will not attempt to recoup -- called 
Wilson's allegations a "smoke screen" meant to disguise the lack of financial 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
The popular inaugural show two years ago left Air/Space America saddled with a 
$2.7-million debt. The city also filed suit and won a judgment for $30,033.78, 
though the debt has not been paid. 
</P>
<P>
Three Air/Space America creditors have sued the city, seeking repayment of more 
than $1 million collectively in debts from the 1988 show, said Deputy City 
Attorney Deborah Hollingsworth. The first lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial 
in August. The city contends that it had an agreement with Air/Space America 
absolving it from responsibility for such claims, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Air/Space officials did not respond to a message left on a telephone 
answering machine at their headquarters. But in the past two weeks, the 
organization has attempted to contact 170 exhibitors who paid up-front fees to 
display their wares at the planned 10-day trade show. Organizers had said that 
the show would attract thousands of potential buyers from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably out $80 grand," acknowledged Howard Ruggles, San Diego district 
manager for Hughes Aircraft, one of seven companies that in 1988 paid $100,000 
to become a founder of Air/Space America. 
</P>
<P>
Founders used up $20,000 of their initial payment for booth space at the 
premier show in 1988, and expected to use $20,000 at each of the biennial shows 
that Air/Space America had hoped to host during the next decade. Ruggles last 
week said he was uncertain if the company would sue to get its money back. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the cancellation apparently was slow to spread to some exhibitors, 
including the China Great Wall Industrial Corp., which, last week was still 
sending parts of its exhibit to a holding warehouse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I have another shipment coming in this morning," said a Los Angeles-based 
freight forwarder for the Great Wall Corp., which produces rockets that carry 
satellites into orbit. "Nobody told me about any cancellation," the freight 
forwarder said. 
</P>
<P>
Air/Space America evidently has sent letters to some exhibitors, asking them to 
be patient. "We have received a letter that says too many companies are asking 
too many questions right now and they're not prepared to answer them," said 
Guodong Tian, a spokesman for the Great Wall Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The state of South Dakota, which exhibited during Air/Space America's premiere 
show in 1988, learned of the cancellation a week after the show was officially 
cancelled, according to a trade show industry source who asked that his name 
not be used. The governor of South Dakota is now considering legal action to 
win back the state's down payment for the trade show, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
As of last week, Air/Space America had yet to officially inform some 
contractors that the show had been canceled, said Chuck Hoover, whose 
Phoenix-based company had been hired to stage aerial portions of the planned 
air extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover, who heard about the cancellation "through the grapevine," planned to 
turn his Air/Space America contract over to an attorney to determine his legal 
recourse.

GALLEGLY CHALLENGER BEGINS AD CAMPAIGN URGING FBI DISCLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly's challenger in the June primary has launched a radio and 
newspaper advertising campaign urging the Simi Valley Republican to release the 
full record of his contacts with the FBI about an investigation of four Los 
Angeles agents in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Release your FBI file now!" exhorts a newspaper ad for GOP candidate Sang 
Korman in bold white letters on a black background. "Sign the release, Elton." 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which has been running in papers throughout the 21st District since 
Monday, includes a coupon requesting release of the internal investigation 
record. Addressed to FBI headquarters in Washington, the coupon is designed to 
resemble a memo from Gallegly. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly must formally waive his right to privacy before the FBI can make the 
full record available. Portions of the record already have been made public 
under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
If Gallegly refuses to respond, Korman said Tuesday, he will run the ads until 
the June 5 primary and will produce a television spot on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"If he has nothing to hide, he will sign on the papers," Korman said. "I 
believe he has something to hide." Korman said he did not know what Gallegly 
allegedly was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Korman, a Calabasas real estate developer, has seized on disclosures in 
recently released FBI investigative files in his bid to upset the two-term 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
The documents show that Gallegly repeatedly complained to high-ranking FBI 
officials that four veteran agents had threatened him and conspired to defeat 
him in 1988 in violation of a law prohibiting federal employees from working to 
influence the outcome of an election. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, and again in interviews last month, Gallegly denied complaining 
about the agents' actions. The agents, who live in Gallegly's district, were 
investigated by the bureau and eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly could not be reached for comment Tuesday. He repeatedly has sought to 
dismiss the matter as politically motivated and trivial, maintaining that his 
support for law enforcement "has never wavered." 
</P>
<P>
Korman, who was opposing Gallegly in the June, 1988, primary when the FBI issue 
first became public, said he was seeking to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
The radio ad characterizes the FBI imbroglio as "a political mystery story." It 
asks: "Who's telling the truth? What's behind this strange dispute?" 
</P>
<P>
The initial campaign will cost $5,000 and continue for a week, Korman said. The 
ad is appearing in six newspapers and on six radio stations in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties. Korman said he will spend an additional $10,000 to $20,000 to 
continue the campaign for a month if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Korman said he recently loaned his election campaign $100,000 and expects to 
provide additional sums in the future. He loaned his campaign $255,000 in 1988. 
The loan has not been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Korman said he plans to begin a $55,000 television ad campaign May 8, but he 
declined to disclose its focus. The ads will start on cable television stations 
and, beginning in mid-May, air on Los Angeles network affiliates, said Bob 
Lavoie, Korman's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional candidates in the Los Angeles area rarely advertise on television 
because the cost is so high and the ads reach a diffused audience stretching 
across many districts. 
</P>
<P>
In his bid to challenge Gallegly's credentials as a law-enforcement advocate, 
Korman issued a news release criticizing the incumbent's vote against a 1989 
measure that authorized $127 million for 700 additional police officers and 
construction of an 800-bed prison for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another case of Mr. Gallegly's voting record not matching his 
rhetoric," Korman said. "Maybe Mr. Gallegly doesn't feel that the efforts of 
police officers in Washington, D.C., or FBI agents around the nation are that 
important."

SCHOOL STARTING, ENDING BELL TIMES WILL GO ON A ROTATION SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to promote fairness, bell times for starting and ending the school 
day will be rotated every five years, beginning next fall, at almost all San 
Diego city elementary and middle schools that use bus transportation, trustees 
decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 4 to 1, with Trustee Jim Roache opposed, to implement the 
controversial rotating schedule at about 20 schools in the 1990-91 year. 
</P>
<P>
Additional schools will be added each year until almost 90 are on five-year 
rotations. Initially, some will be placed on the generally preferred early 
times and others on the less popular 9 a.m. start schedules. Those schools that 
for years have enjoyed the early times will be the first to rotate to later 
times for five years, and those with late times will be phased in for the early 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Only 12 schools, which are without any bused students, will be exempt from the 
new procedures. Another 7 schools -- Torrey Pines, La Jolla, Fremont, Florence, 
Longfellow, Loma Portal and Freeze -- will remain voluntarily with the late 
start and dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary and middle school start and end times will include: 7:50 a.m. to 
2:10 a.m., 8 a.m. to 2:20 p.m., 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 9:15 a.m. to 3:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Junior and senior high schools, including the atypical secondary schools at 
Gompers, Muir and the School for Creative and Performing Arts, will be anchored 
permanently on 7:30 a.m. to 2:10 p.m. schedules to allow students enough time 
for afternoon extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
The board said it decided to move ahead with the complex and controversial plan 
on the basis of equity. 
</P>
<P>
Because the district has a plethora of special integration and special 
education programs that result in bus transportation of students all over the 
city, schools now start and stop at different times based on the limited number 
of buses available to deliver and pick up students. 
</P>
<P>
The district has been under pressure from federal education officials to begin 
all special education programs at the same time as regular instruction at a 
given school, in order to allow more special education students chances to 
participate in regular classes during part of the day (so-called 
mainstreaming). 
</P>
<P>
But it would cost the district more than $1 million to maintain current 
schedules -- under which most schools begin and end early -- and improve the 
transportation picture for special education children by adding buses. By 
rotating schools at the same time -- and giving those with perennially late 
times preferred schedules -- the district will spend only another $278,000 
because fewer buses will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
However, the plan continued to face vocal opposition from parents at schools 
with longstanding early times. Parents complained Tuesday of the difficulty in 
rearranging child care and car pools every five years, particularly if they 
have work schedules that call for them to leave before their children can be 
driven to school in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Board Vice President Shirley Weber conceded that trustees were influenced by 
the strident opposition from parents, and said her ideal would be to give every 
school its preferred schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But Weber said that with the district facing a possible funding shortage next 
year, trustees could not justify spending additional money for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Roache said the board may have "created a monster" that could come 
back to haunt administrators, much like a computerized bus transportation plan 
that failed in the mid-1980s after costing the district more than $2 million.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter's retrial on fraud and conspiracy charges linked to the 
collapse of the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm, due to begin Tuesday, was 
postponed for a week after a brief hearing in San Diego federal court. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam put off the start of Hunter's trial until 
May 8 to give defense attorney Richard Marmaro, out of state on another case, 
time to finish the other matter. 
</P>

Hunter, a former Del Mar mayor, was convicted in December -- after an

DISABLED MAN SUES RED ONION CHARGING ACCESS VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A paraplegic sued the parent company of the Red Onion restaurants Tuesday, 
alleging that its Woodland Hills restaurant violates laws requiring 
accessibility for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Somers, who is confined to a wheelchair, said in his Superior Court 
lawsuit that he went to the Red Onion restaurant in Woodland Hills last month 
to have dinner and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Somers has won several prizes in dance contests for "upper-body" dancing, the 
lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance to the dining room is accessible only by stairs and Somers 
declined offers by the restaurant's employees to carry him in his wheelchair 
down the flight of stairs, the lawsuit said. Instead, Somers entered through an 
emergency door in the restaurant's cantina that set off a loud siren 
"attracting the attention of most of the patrons," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Somers discovered that the restrooms were not accessible because they are 
upstairs and that the dance floor was inaccessible because it is sunken, the 
lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that the restaurant had been remodeled since it was built in 1970 
and is subject to recent laws requiring accessibility for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph B. Saltsman, a lawyer for Red Onion, said the Woodland Hills restaurant 
is exempt from the accessibility laws because of its age, despite the 
remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
Somers won $1,000 in damages in a similar suit against the Red Onion's Marina 
del Rey restaurant, Saltsman said, and has filed similar lawsuits against at 
least two other restaurants.

CABBIE DRESS CODE

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Taxicab Driver Appearance Guidelines," Metro, April 19: 
</P>
<P>
The Times is quite right, the lot of the city's taxi drivers is indeed tough. 
The new dress code requirement, however, will make it brighter by giving the 
courteous, well-dressed cabbie renewed self-respect, gratitude from the 
taxi-riding public and by all indications higher gratuities.

FINANCIER MICHAEL MILKEN'S PLEADS GUILTY TO 6 FELONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milken's pleading guilty to fraud really does not prove to me that he is. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it a cause for celebration. What it does prove is that federal 
prosecutors have unlimited power and resources at their command. That they can 
coerce, intimidate and threaten anyone into confessing whatever they want, 
without a trial. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sad day for all Americans. Because if someone with the wealth and 
connections of a Michael Milken can be forced into admitting what he does not 
believe, what chance do the rest of us have?

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY SETTLES SUIT OVER POLICE BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials have agreed to pay $65,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a 
Lancaster youth who said he was beaten by a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
sergeant during an arrest in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The county Claims Board voted Monday to settle the suit filed by Stephen Pszyk, 
18, out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Pszyk charged that Sgt. Stephen Nelson hit him repeatedly with a billy club, 
damaging several of the youth's teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Pszyk alleged in the suit that Nelson beat him after he and another youth were 
pursued by several deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies said they suspected the two youths of trying to break in to parked 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
Pszyk's attorney confirmed his client's acceptance of the settlement.

OVERSIZE HOMES BANNED ON SMALL TOPANGA CANYON LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved planning 
regulations Tuesday that will stop the construction of large houses on small 
lots in the rugged Topanga Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Topanga residents had complained that the area was being overbuilt 
by property owners who erected huge houses on parcels that were subdivided more 
than 60 years ago for weekend cabins. 
</P>
<P>
County officials also expressed concern that the buildup was causing septic 
tank problems and posed a fire hazard because inadequate driveways resulted in 
cars being parked on the windy narrow roads, blocking access for emergency 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, a mathematical formula will be used to determine the 
maximum size of a house based on the size of the lot and the average slope of 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines were amended last week, however, to allow existing residents to 
rebuild comparably sized houses if their residences are destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy that the long process has ended and now Topanga has a unified 
set of regulations that can put a stop to the misplaced construction that was 
inappropriate for the steep slopes," said John Leary, attorney for the Topanga 
Town Council and two area homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,600 vacant lots could be affected by the ordinance, said Bob Hoie, a 
county supervising regional planner. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations will take effect in September.

FINANCIER MICHAEL MILKEN'S PLEADS GUILTY TO 6 FELONIES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Charles Dickens were writing "Oliver Twist" today he would likely model his 
character of Fagin on a mixture of Milken, Boesky and several other Wall Street 
manipulators largely consumed by greed. 
</P>
<P>
It is not enough for Milken to consent to a fine of $600 million, a huge sum by 
any standard but a mere pittance to a man who was reported to have made that 
much in one year. 
</P>
<P>
The judge in this case has a golden opportunity to prove to us all that crime 
doesn't pay by inducing Milken to barter some of the 28 years of imprisonment 
-- to which he is subject -- for the untold hundreds of millions of dollars 
this man has already salted away. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street manipulators should never be permitted to keep any of their 
ill-gotten gains.

One need not plead guilty to felonies to be a good family man, nor pay criminal

TAX REVOLT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution were the shots heard 'round 
the world, then this Poll Tax Revolt in Great Britain should trigger a "read my 
lips" revolt against all the nickel-and-dime taxes in the U.S. But it won't 
because Americans have been so lulled that they will endure all kinds of 
political abuse. 
</P>
<P>
We must stop all this foolishness. A progressive income tax properly 
administered should cover all costs of providing services our citizens want and 
need. We must stop special taxes on gasoline, tobacco, alcohol and use taxes 
for purposes not relating to these taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have just paid their various income taxes. Wasn't that enough?

NEW FORMAT ON EDITORIAL PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's difficult to tell one's wife that her new outfit doesn't quite suit her, 
or one's mother that her home-cooked meals are too salty, or indeed to tell the 
editors of The Times that their new editorial page format (introduced April 23) 
sucks. 
</P>
<P>
But I've done it, and I'm doing it. 
</P>
<P>
There is no newspaper west of the Hudson River that has had two pages of 
opinion more readable, informative and deserving of respect than yours; why 
change its dress? The varying type styles heading the editorials are 
confounding and demeaning, making them appear as news stories of differing 
import; the movement of the editorials from the dignified and traditional left 
column to a scattering across the top half of the page shocked me as much as 
the publishers of "new" Bibles did when they abandoned the double columns of 
the old St. James version; the maze of horizontal and vertical lines between 
pieces are as unseemly as they are unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
You may think the changed format will gain some new readers; please consider 
its offense to the old.

SOCIAL POLICY: THERE'S A NEW WAR ON POVERTY AFOOT, AND AT ITS HEART ARE 
CONSERVATIVE IDEAS AIMED AT EMPOWERING THE POOR. WELFARE BUREAUCRATS, LOOK OUT.

If you go far enough to the left in American politics, you may bump into the 
right, and there you will find that America is on the verge of a new war on 
poverty. Leading it are people who never knew each other, let alone talked to 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Wisconsin state Rep. Annette Polly Williams. Williams, a 
black, has been poor most of her life. She still lives in the inner-city 
Milwaukee neighborhood where she raised four children, spent some time on 
welfare and finally, 20 years after graduating from high school, got her 
college degree. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, Williams took on the entire liberal Establishment of Wisconsin 
by authoring a bill that would give poor parents in Milwaukee tuition vouchers 
for their children. Each family that qualified would receive $2,500 per child, 
which would be subtracted from the public school system's budget. The vouchers 
could be used at any city school -- public or private. 
</P>
<P>
To the chagrin of the liberals, a coalition of Republicans and conservative 
Democrats made Williams' bill the law. 
</P>
<P>
Williams did not discover the voucher idea by reading tracts churned out by 
conservative think tanks. She simply concluded that when black parents wanted 
education for their children, the power structure gave them integration. What 
that amounted to was "magnet" schools to attract white students into the city 
and ridiculously long bus rides to take black children out of the city. While 
blacks wanted to "educate," Williams said, the white power structure wanted to 
"integrate and transportat." 
</P>
<P>
Out of frustration, Williams "came up with an idea, and it turned out that what 
I was talking about was a voucher concept . . . People with money were always 
able to buy into an area with good schools." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., the new war on poverty is being waged by Kimi Gray. Like 
Williams, Gray is a former welfare mother. She had the first of her five 
children at age 14 and has lived in public housing for much of her life. She is 
a leader in the movement to allow residents of public housing projects to buy 
their own apartments. To do this, she had to get a federal law changed and, in 
so doing, she hooked up with a conservative -- Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development Jack Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
Like tuition vouchers, tenant ownership of public housing used to be a 
conservative idea. But in the hands of Gray and Williams, ideas that were 
conservative become something else entirely. Gray taught Kemp a thing or two 
about public housing; the bill that permits tenants to buy public housing 
contains provisions that would renovate the properties before sale and would 
reserve the properties for resale to moderate-income people. Thus, the 
conservative notion of privatization became a vehicle for empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
In the hands of Williams, vouchers, which in the classic conservative version 
subsidized rich whites in private schools, were limited to families with 
incomes up to 175% of the poverty level, thus giving poor parents some of the 
choice that middle-class parents have. Says Gray, "Our theme is empowerment, 
empowerment of the people . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
How well can poor people make choices for themselves? "Low-income black 
families," said Williams, "know that the only way out is education . . . They 
(bureaucrats) honestly believe that poor families can't make decisions." 
</P>
<P>
For both Williams and Gray, the enemy is not necessarily the right or the left; 
it is the welfare bureaucracy -- a group referred to by Williams as "the 
poverty industry pimps -- the people in the middle." Both women complained that 
government money was going to the bureaucrats, not poor people. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives have been quick to celebrate and adapt to this new war on 
poverty. Stuart Butler, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, has outlined a 
poverty strategy in the National Review: Reach an accommodation on civil 
rights, adopt a strategy of empowerment, attack the poverty industry and allow 
states to be the innovators of antipoverty policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all registered Democrats," responds Gray, "but we work very closely 
with Republicans because they're the ones that seem to understand that we do 
not want to stay a poor and permanent underclass." 
</P>
<P>
Social policy is an inexact science. Some pieces of the original war on poverty 
were spectacular successes; others weren't. But the new effort has to contend 
with a creation of the original -- an entrenched establishment of middle-class 
people whose livelihood depends on the continuation of certain programs 
regardless of their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Williams laughs at the idea that her voucher bill for 1,000 poor pupils 
is a threat to the public school system, but it is, she admits, a warning. Her 
message to the Milwaukee school system is a message that all big-city systems 
should hear: "It's gonna make it better or it's gonna dismantle it . . . If you 
all are worried about your jobs, try doing them better."

FOR RIOTING'S SAKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG DiFRANCO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOUG DiFRANCO is the editor of the Mustang Daily at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
The Times asked his views of the weekend rioting at the annual Poly Royal 
festival, which the university has decided to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
 They've been trying to pinpoint a reason why this started. None can really be 
found. There's no underlying social conflict that caused this. Over the recent 
months we've seen rioting in China for democracy and in Eastern Europe for 
freedom. In San Luis Obispo, they show rioting for rioting's sake. It just 
doesn't make sense. I don't know if anyone's going to come up with a reason. 
</P>
<P>
As a whole, Poly students are mad that this happened. The past 58 years, the 
whole emphasis (of the Poly Royal festival) was to showcase the university and 
what its students could do. It's kind of ironic, San Luis Obispo getting that 
award for being the best little town, then Poly students are identified with 
rioting. 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the students I've talked to think the police at 
first tried to act calmly and not resort to force, but it became apparent that 
the crowd was not going to listen to them. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the university canceling the entire thing, we feel that it was a 
responsible decision to make. It will certainly quiet the problem. But we do 
think they may have acted too hastily. We think it was meant to calm the rising 
tempers in the community. Was there really a need to announce it the next day? 
Or could they have thought about it over the coming months and come up with 
alternatives?

POLITICS AND JUSTICE ARE A POOR MIX; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: JUDGES WHO BEMOAN THE INTRUSION OF POLITICS INTO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OFTEN 
FAIL TO SEE THAT THEY INVITED THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By W. F. RYLAARSDAM, W. F. Rylaarsdam is a Superior Court judge in Orange 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The relationship between the judiciary and the political process continues to 
fester. The tension was highlighted last month when retiring California Supreme 
Court Justice Marcus Kaufman in effect charged that the court, under the 
leadership of former Chief Justice Rose Bird, set out deliberately to sabotage 
the law that requires capital punishment for certain murderers. Such 
premeditated undermining of a valid law would place the court squarely in the 
political arena. Be it abortion rights under Roe vs. Wade, the death penalty, 
or any one of a large number of politically sensitive issues, the judiciary is 
increasingly viewed as making public policy rather than merely applying the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Until this century, it was generally assumed that it was the sole function of 
the judiciary to apply the law. Where a subject was covered by statute, the 
courts would attempt to ascertain the intent of the framers of the statute; 
where it was not, the courts would search for decisions in prior cases to 
determine what the law was. Neither individual judges' social philosophy nor 
their attitudes toward the particular law were supposed to be a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
This system came under attack by legal philosophers early in the 20th Century. 
Scholars led by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and Harvard's Roscoe Pound gave 
respectability to the ideology that the function of the courts was to "do 
justice" rather than to mechanically apply existing law. This trend toward use 
of the legal process as a "creative" means of solving actual and perceived 
social problems has dominated legal education since the 1940s. Judicial 
decisions are routinely praised or deplored, by the general public, the media 
and the legal profession, not on the basis of inherent correctness but rather 
on the basis of the social policies that the decisions foster or hinder. 
</P>
<P>
In the abstract, the concept that a judge should "do justice" rather than 
"mechanically apply the law" has considerable appeal. In practice, however, 
this means that cases are decided on an ad hoc basis, based on a particular 
judge's subjective interpretation of the result demanded by his or her sense of 
justice. This has resulted in intrusion by the judiciary into the legislative 
function, uncertainty in the law, unreasonable demands on the judicial system 
and attempts at political interference with the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
To decide what the law ought to be in the light of prevailing social policies 
is to make a political decision. This type of decision-making has traditionally 
rested with the legislature. The manner in which legislatures are elected is 
intended to make them representative of the political mores of their electors. 
If the electorate feels that the laws do not reflect prevailing social 
policies, the election mechanism permits them to do something about it. Despite 
its deficiencies, the process does permit an expression of social values and, 
more important, it permits changes in social values to be reflected fairly 
speedily. 
</P>
<P>
Justice, however, demands that judges be impartial. This means that the law 
should apply equally to all persons. It does not demand, and in fact it should 
prohibit, that the judge consider the effect of the law on a particular 
litigant. Nor does justice require that the judge consider whether the law is 
good or bad; that is a political decision for the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
It is because of the mixing of law with social policy that the independence of 
the judiciary from political influence continues to be threatened. If judges 
considered themselves administrators of the law, it would only be necessary to 
consider the legal abilities of judicial candidates, not their political 
biases. However, as long as judges continue to make political decisions, the 
inquiry unfortunately becomes highly relevant. The demand that appointees to 
judicial office pass a political litmus test prevented a candidate as 
well-qualified as Robert Bork from assuming his place on the U.S. Supreme Court 
and it continues to confront other judicial candidates. Members of the 
judiciary are probably more conscious and concerned about this trend than any 
other group. Yet many of them fail to recognize that the problem stems from 
their own result-oriented judicial philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
Judicial independence is a paramount value in our scheme of government. The 
concept is part of the genius of our federal and state constitutions and has 
served our society well. Judicial independence is also one of the most fragile 
concepts in our constitutions. Since the judiciary neither controls its budget 
nor its enforcement power, it must rely to a significant extent on the goodwill 
of the other branches of government, and hence of the voting public, to 
maintain its independence. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, largely as a result of 20th-Century judicial philosophies, 
judicial independence is increasingly vulnerable. From inquiries into the 
personal and political attitudes of candidates for the judiciary to personal 
attacks on judges and justices, our society shows a growing dissatisfaction 
with judicial decisions that are rightly perceived to be political rather than 
legal. As a result, attempts to define the criteria for judicial appointment in 
political terms gain greater acceptance. It is a situation created by at least 
some judges, but which the judiciary refuses to recognize as its own problem.

Does the United States still believe in anything? Does America still stand for 
independence and freedom and human dignity? Evidently not. A half century of 
brave words about "captive nations" has been shown as so much cheap talk as the 
Bush Administration puts its stamp of approval on another "expedient solution," 
the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact that condemned the Baltic states to communist 
enslavement. 
</P>
<P>
Reports that President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have 
entered into a cabal with French President Francois Mitterrand, West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to 
strangle Lithuanian independence in its cradle give new meaning to Lithuanian 
President Vytautas Landsbergis' charges that a new Munich is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically, just when America's ideals have caused a worldwide resurgence in 
democracy, the United States itself is undercutting its own legacy. The Bush 
Administration has somehow gotten into its head the notion that appeasement is 
now the best policy. Those who have tried to bring them to their senses, like 
arms control negotiator Edward J. Rowny, have been eased out of power. 
Agreement at any price is once again the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Don't we ever learn? 
</P>
<P>
We won the Cold War because of our principles. We may end up losing the peace 
because of our lack of them.

CASTRO SEES TO IT THAT SOCKERS WIN

<P>
Eye contact? From the other end of the field? 
</P>
<P>
But seriously, Rod Castro . . . 
</P>
<P>
Castro, a first-year Socker forward, was party to the victory and part of the 
fun Tuesday at the St. Louis Arena, where the Sockers squashed the Storm, 4-1, 
to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five MISL Western Division semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Locker room. Castro is explaining his second goal of the game, when he got 
behind defender Mark Frederickson, took a length of the carpet pass in the air 
from defender Ralph Black and drilled it past goalie Slobo Ilijevski to make it 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Ralph and I made eye contact," Castro says. 
</P>
<P>
Guffaws circulate throughout the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Eye contact?" defender George Fernandez says with a grin. "I'm sure. Eighty 
yards away?" 
</P>
<P>
"No seriously, we did." Castro says. "I signaled him." 
</P>
<P>
Captain Brian Quinn offers his two cents as defender Kevin Crow starts making 
signals like a third-base coach. Hands to the chest, to the forehead and to his 
arm. Crow shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
Says Quinn: "I thought when Juli Veee left, that was the end of bull... But the 
AISA is producing them." 
</P>
<P>
Castro came from the American Indoor Soccer Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers came from San Diego Tuesday morning on a 7 a.m. flight with stubble 
and frowns on their faces following St. Louis' 4-3 overtime victory in Game 2 
Monday. Yeah, this was going to be real fun. Two games in St. Louis and the 
possibility, if they didn't improve their road play, of being eliminated from 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But, really, it was perfect. These situations always seem to bring out the best 
in the Sockers, who can never do any of this neatly and cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota came to life 2:39 into the game, tapping the ball through the 
legs of defender Emil Dragicevic and then drilling it into the top right corner 
to give his team a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Before Castro scored his first goal, he created a stir in the paltry crowd of 
3,426 by kicking Ilijevski in the head while going for a ball. Castro got a 
two-minute penalty but no handshake from Ilijevski when he later tried to 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a veteran," said Castro, shrugging. "To him, for somebody like me to kick 
him, it's like 'Get away from me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Castro didn't. He was right there waiting to finish the job a few 
minutes later, after defender Cacho drilled a shot that bounced off Ilijevski's 
hand. Then he was in Ilijevski's face again to top off the famous "eye-contact 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
If Ilijevski was the one smarting, perhaps Socker goalie Zoltan Toth was 
smarter. He was everywhere, making 25 saves, a club playoff record, for his 
second victory in the playoffs. Among his best was a foot save in the third 
quarter on a shot from forward Thompson Usiyan, who undoubtedly could see the 
whites of Toth's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Toth dished off some credit to his defenders, which was appropriate. Black, 
Fernandez, Crow and Cacho made a host of blocks to keep the goal box 
well-protected. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis' lone goal came 5:22 into the fourth, when forward Dan Donigan got by 
Crow after grabbing his jersey and pulling him down. Donigan wound up taking a 
pass from Usiyan to score. Crow had no problems with the play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a good tackle because he hit the ball first," Crow said. "If I 
had made that tackle, I would have thought it was a good clean tackle." 
</P>
<P>
After that, things were a little tight for about three minutes, until forward 
Damir Haramina gathered a pass from Quinn, waited for two bounces and popped it 
in. 
</P>
<P>
The only entertainment remaining was watching Fernandez jousting good-naturedly 
with a 10-year old who was giving him the thumbs down from the stands. 
Fifth-grade stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Game 4 is here Saturday, time enough, Popovic hopes, for his gang to regroup 
and rest their aching limbs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some guys 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 (years old)," he said. "You play three 
games in four days, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Similar to the trouble the Sockers have had on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can play on the road," said Socker Coach Ron Newman, whose team was 
6-20 away from San Diego during the regular season. "We're not the best team on 
the road, but we're not as bad as we were during the season." 
</P>
<P>
Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
Socker goalkeeper Zoltan Toth now has eight consecutive playoff victories . . . 
John Griffin, director of communications for the MISL, said Tuesday that St. 
Louis Coach Don Popovic has been fined for disparaging remarks made about the 
officiating in Saturday's 3-2 Socker victory in San Diego. . . . Storm forward 
Stan Terlecki, who scored 35 points for the Storm in the regular season, 
returned to action Tuesday after missing the first two games with bursitis in 
his right knee.

ANGELS' PARRISH HAS 4-FOR-4 NIGHT IN ROUT OF ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Only by becoming quiet at the plate did Lance Parrish make some noise. 
</P>
<P>
Bedeviled by a slump that almost cost him his starting status, Parrish worked 
on his hitting approach with Angel Manager Doug Rader and batting instructor 
Deron Johnson. They advised the 33-year-old catcher to be calm without being 
passive, "a very, very quiet approach to the ball (that) generates more bat 
speed," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
The change generated a single, a double, two thunderous home runs and four runs 
batted in for Parrish Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It also gave Angel left-hander Jim Abbott the leeway he needed to challenge 
hitters and gain his first victory of the season, a 7-1 rout of the Baltimore 
Orioles that Abbott called "nothing to start talking championship about, but 
something that maybe will get us started." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, it stopped a stretch of four losses in five games for the 
Angels, who are 4-7 on this trip with a game here tonight and another Thursday 
at Seattle remaining. At the most, it represented for Abbott (1-1) the end of 
the harmful effects of the spring-training lockout and for Parrish, the 
beginning of a resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was trying to do is be patient," Parrish said. "I'd been chasing balls 
out of the strike zone. When you have a tendency to jump at the ball, that's 
the opposite of being quiet. I definitely fell into that category. Hitters in 
slumps are overaggressive, which is opposite of the way they should be. I got 
tired of fighting it the other way and tried this (Monday). Hopefully, I can 
maintain it." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish was two for 24 before Monday, when he was two for five in the series 
opener. He has hits in five consecutive at-bats, raising his average from a low 
of .163 Sunday to .250. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize in this game that you're either hot, cold or somewhere in between," 
Parrish said. "When you're struggling, the manager has an obligation to find 
somebody who can do the job. John (Orton) is an exceptional catcher and I had 
to start contributing, or I'd find my butt on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Max Venable came off the bench to open the game with a home run off Oriole 
starter Jay Tibbs (0-3). Luis Polonia, acquired Sunday from the New York 
Yankees, was scheduled to lead off and play left field but has not yet joined 
the team from New York. Rader told Venable to be ready in case Polonia didn't 
make it. Then, the Angel manager delayed handing in the lineup card as long as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on hold and then I wasn't, I was in the game," said Venable, who hit his 
last home run Sept. 26, 1986, while a member of the Cincinnati Reds. "I don't 
care if he ever gets here." 
</P>
<P>
After getting jump-started by Venable's home run, the Angels took a 2-0 lead on 
Parrish's home run to right on a 2-2 count. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to pitch when you have some runs and every little mistake 
isn't so important," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he made many. Baltimore scored its only run in the second, after Mike 
Devereaux's popup fell between right fielder Dante Bichette and second baseman 
Mark McLemore for a leadoff double. Devereaux promptly stole third and scored 
on Bob Melvin's grounder to short. The Orioles put runners on second and third 
in the third inning on a single by Cal Ripken Jr. and a double by Randy 
Milligan, but Abbott got out of that jam by striking out Craig Worthington. 
</P>
<P>
"The first inning was a little shaky," Parrish said of Abbott, "but he worked 
himself into a position where we could open wide with any pitch. He threw a few 
curveballs, some changeups, and he threw strikes with his fastball." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got him some breathing room in the fourth, on Parrish's three-run, 
405-foot blast into the left-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
McLemore contributed a run-scoring single in the sixth, and Bichette drove in 
the final run with a home run to left in the eighth, his first home run in 12 
games and only his second RBI in 12 games. It helped the Angels score more than 
five runs for the first time since they had seven in a 12-inning game April 14 
against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have runs to work with, you're supposed to throw the ball over the 
plate, and that's what I tried to do," Abbott said. "I felt that my arm 
strength was there. I think the lockout effects are gone for me, and this 
outing was true to form." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish hopes the same is true for him. "Amazing, isn't it?" he said after his 
first two-home run game since July 9, 1986 when he was with Detroit. "I hope I 
can maintain the same thought processes. You can put that down -- amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Agreement, Luis Polonia has 72 hours after the trade to 
report to his new club. That period expires tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher John Orton (sore left shoulder) has improved and was available last 
night, although he did not start. Johnny Ray (right shoulder bursitis) took 
early batting practice and also was available. Bob McClure (sore left elbow) 
threw softly for 15 minutes for the second consecutive day and reported no 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish's eighth-inning double extended the Angels' streak to 19 
consecutive games with at least one double, two short of the club record set in 
1971. . . . The Angels' pitchers don't have a complete game this season. . . . 
The Orioles had won the previous four games from the Angels. . . . Parrish's 
two home runs came one night after Oriole center fielder Steve Finley reached 
above and behind the fence to rob him of a homer. "I told him when he came up 
the first time that I was going to try and hit 'em where he couldn't get 'em," 
Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken played in his 1,271st consecutive game Tuesday, 36 
behind Everett Scott's second-place total of 1,307. The all-time record of 
2,130 was set by Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill entertained his teammates before the game by going through his 
repertoire of impersonations. Throwing left-handed, Hill did a fine Tommy John 
impression, which goes with his Don Sutton and Frank Tanana. He also does a 
good imitation of side-armer Gene Garber, but Sutton and John hold a special 
place in his affections. "I like the old Dodgers," said Hill, who lived in 
Huntington Beach and graduated from Edison High School. "I grew up with the 
1970 Dodgers, John, Sutton and those guys."

NOT SO FAST: ROCKETS SLOW THE LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
GAME 3: HOUSTON KEEPS CONTROL IN FOURTH QUARTER FOR 114-108 VICTORY. L.A. LOSES 
FOR FIRST TIME IN A BEST-OF-FIVE PLAYOFF GAME. 
</P>

HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourth quarters usually belong to the Lakers. That is when their level of play 
soars, when they can arise from even the most daunting of deficits and take 
control. It has become nearly instinctive, especially at playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
That changed here Tuesday night. The Houston Rockets, tired of falling just 
short in this first-round series, staved off elimination with a 114-108 victory 
over the Lakers before 16,611 fans in the Summit. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Lakers' first loss in a first-round series since the NBA switched to 
a best-of-five format in 1984. They had won 20 consecutive first-round games, 
taking the first two from Houston by dominating the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity was there again Tuesday. The Lakers began the fourth quarter 
trailing only 92-90, in good shape considering that they were on the road 
against an inspired team whose coach, Don Chaney, had "guaranteed" two 
consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of becoming forceful in the fourth, the Lakers folded. It was neither 
pretty nor predictable. 
</P>
<P>
In the last quarter, the Lakers made only five of 18 shots and allowed the 
Rockets to shoot 59%. Magic Johnson, double-teamed all night, attempted only 
three shots in the quarter, all were failed three-point tries. James Worthy, 
who had 26 points, made only one of four shots in that span. Those two subdued, 
no other Laker stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Rockets put together a 15-5 run in the first 6:29 of the 
quarter and led, 107-95. The Lakers' fourth-quarter sluggishness was evident 
right away, Houston scoring six consecutive points in the first 1:28. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers did muster their strength and cut the Rockets' lead to 111-108 with 
46 seconds left after Byron Scott's three-point basket, but they could get no 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
Typifying the Lakers' play was a rare five-second violation on Michael Cooper 
on an inbound play with 23 seconds left and the Lakers trailing by five points. 
Cooper tried to pass it to Johnson, who was covered, then Scott, also covered. 
Eventually, he passed to referee Joe Forte, who gave the ball to the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Long before that, though, Houston had taken control. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great game for three periods," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
But, about that fourth . . . 
</P>
<P>
"At the top of the period, that 6-0 run gave them life," Riley said. "We had a 
hard time getting back in it. We got a little out of sync. We took some long 
shots, the same shots we hit the last two games to get back in it in the fourth 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, wary after losing a seven-point lead with 7:46 left in Game 2 
Sunday, seemed determined to prevent a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident by the 6-0 run. Akeem Olajuwon, hampered by foul trouble 
earlier in the second half, began the surge by tipping in Otis Thorpe's missed 
jumper. After a turnover by Orlando Woolridge, Sleepy Floyd drove the lane for 
a basket. Then, after Scott and Worthy failed to connect on a pass, Thorpe 
completed a fast-break dunk to make it 98-90. Timeout, Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers did not score in the fourth quarter until A.C. Green, who had 16 
points, sank an 18-foot jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the run in the fourth quarter like the Lakers made on us," said Floyd, 
who had 23 points and a Rocket playoff-record 18 assists. "We turned up the 
defense a notch, and we responded excellently to the challenge. We showed a lot 
of character." 
</P>
<P>
Despite trailing by two points, Laker players said they felt in position to win 
heading into the fourth quarter. They were at a loss to explain what happened 
and vowed it would not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's statement: "We just have to play better in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy elaborated. 
</P>
<P>
"We just a had a little mental lapse, and they had three of four quick 
baskets," he said. "From that point, we were behind and had to play catch up. 
Any time you get down at that point in the game, it's tough. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple lapses earlier. When we'd get (the deficit) down to one or two 
points, we didn't execute. That's not like us." 
</P>
<P>
Game 3 was very unlike the Lakers at several junctures. 
</P>
<P>
They fell behind by 12 points midway through the first quarter -- no surprise 
there -- but then rallied to trail by one entering the second quarter. From 
there, the Lakers cut Houston's lead to one point three times but failed to 
overtake the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' big break, however, came 26 seconds into the third quarter when 
Olajuwon received his fourth foul contesting Green on a rebound. Initially, the 
Lakers seized the chance. Green made both free throws, then sank a jumper 32 
seconds later to tie it, 60-60. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers took their first lead, 62-60, with 10:40 to play on Johnson's 
fast-break layup after Worthy stole the ball from Vernon Maxwell. Johnson was 
fouled on the drive but, as a harbinger of squandered opportunities to come, he 
missed the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Olajuwon's absence was a time the Lakers could exploit the Rockets. 
Instead, they did their best just to stay close. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe took over Olajuwon's low post obligations and hurt the Lakers more than 
Olajuwon, who finished with 22 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe quickly erased the last Laker lead of the game -- 64-63 with 9:46 left 
in the third -- with consecutive three-point plays in a one-minute span. Both 
were drives inside. He was fouled first by Green, then by Mychal Thompson. 
Neither could adequately defend Thorpe, 6 feet 10 but quicker than either 
defender. Thorpe had 10 of his career playoff-high 27 points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very scary being without Akeem," Chaney said. "Usually, when he's out, 
we decline. We were able to buy some time." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers considered it an opportunity lost. That wasn't all that was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had 17 points and 18 assists, but he made only five of 14 shots. "They 
doubled me; it was nothing new," he said. "But everybody else has got to hit 
the shots, or we're in trouble. There's nothing different I can do. Just make 
the pass. I can't force it. Other people just got to step on up. We know what 
they're trying to do to me. We have to get back to rotating quicker. They got 
some big second shots (12 offensive rebounds)." 
</P>
<P>
All five Rocket starters reached double figures, all but Buck Johnson scoring 
at least 20 points. Floyd and Maxwell combined for 49 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to look at (Houston's backcourt) and make adjustments," Riley said. 
"We may try something different." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, asked if the Lakers are capable of winning at the Summit, said, 'Yes, we 
can win here.' " 
</P>
<P>
A Houston writer asked, "Can you guarantee it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'll see you guys tomorrow," said Riley, walking away.

A CBS producer said his interview with Akeem Olajuwon, during which the Houston 
Rocket center said he might ask for a trade, occurred a day before the start of 
the first-round playoff series, not two months before as Olajuwon later told 
Houston sportswriters.

WEATHER OR NOT, IT WAS A STRONG START

"The catch rates were good; the weather was crummy," said Curtis Milliron, a 
fisheries biologist with the Department of Fish and Game, who monitored the 
opening of trout season last weekend at Crowley Lake in the Eastern Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the weekend could mean good news for fishermen when the weather 
settles into a milder pattern. Those braving winds to 60 m.p.h. Saturday 
averaged 0.6 fish an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"People were staying out there, trying to get their fish, and the fishing was 
very difficult," Milliron said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the effort was not quite as high, but the weather was calm until 
about 11 a.m. Fishermen averaged 0.8 fish an hour that day. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow trout made up 99% of the catch over the weekend, the average fish 
measuring just over 12 inches and weighing 0.82 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Brown trout, which Milliron said typically don't become active until later in 
the season, made up the other 1% of the weekend's catch, averaging 14.8 inches 
and weighing 1 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The catch rates were higher this year than last and the fish that were planted 
last year and are showing up in this year's creel are of an acceptable size and 
quality," Milliron said. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide reduction of the legal take to five fish from 10 was adhered to 
by most, although there were 13 citations for over-limits, as opposed to none 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the reduction is supposed to benefit fishermen hoping for 
bigger fish. Milliron said that planted rainbow trout in "put-and-take" streams 
and reservoirs had averaged three fish to the pound and this season will 
average two to the pound. 
</P>
<P>
Fly fishermen at nearby Hot Creek -- a wild-trout fishery in which only flies 
can be used and all fish must be released -- averaged 2.5 fish an hour on 
Saturday and 1.6 Sunday for a weekend average of 2.2. Of all the fish caught, 
28% measured more than 12 inches and 4.4% more than 15 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen wardens made contact with 3,616 fishermen in the Eastern Sierra, 
issuing 64 verbal warnings and 103 citations for various violations. The 
majority were for using illegal bait or hooks on Crowley Lake tributaries. 
There were 17 citations issued to anglers fishing without licenses and 20 for 
fishing during a closed season. 
</P>
<P>
The Princess Louise, an old cruise ship and more recently a San Pedro 
restaurant, will become the Southland's newest artificial reef today when DFG 
officials sink the 330-foot liner in 90 feet of water about 1 1/2 miles off 
Point Vicente on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The ship has been thoroughly cleaned and anything that might rust has been 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego sportfishers continue to find yellowtail feeding under floating kelp 
paddies in the waters south of Point Loma, and white sea bass are again active 
on the backside of Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
"We went over there last night and got our squid, and woke up (Tuesday) morning 
and the sea bass were underneath the boat at about 5 o'clock," Skipper Bobby 
Taft of the Top Gun said in an interview with Phil Friedman of the telephone 
line 976-TUNA. "And we managed to get limits of sea bass (one a person until a 
three-fish limit is imposed June 15) out if it, one yellowtail and limits of 
calico bass (10 a person)." 
</P>
<P>
Taft said most fish were about 20 pounds, a few at 30-50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Striped marlin fishing remains excellent off Cabo San Lucas, with some billfish 
hitting the scales at upward of 200 pounds -- one at 264. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Mike Daniel, David Forbes and party fished last weekend aboard the 
Tortuga II and Tortuga V, catching and releasing 12 marlin, taking home five 
dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The DFG plans to expand the San Diego portion of the Ocean Resources 
Enhancement and Hatchery Program to include California halibut. The 5-year-old 
program releases thousands of white sea bass into San Diego waters as part of a 
feasibility study on enhancing marine populations through the use of 
hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Game Commission has delayed until June a review of proposed black 
bear hunting seasons and until August reviews of seasons involving nongame and 
fur-bearing mammals. License and tag applications for the newly approved 
seasons for deer, wild pig, pronghorn antelope, elk, bighorn sheep, tree 
squirrels and rabbits -- regulations for which become effective July 1 -- 
should be available at DFG offices and license agents outlets by mid-May.

HIS STYLE IS PICTURE PERFECT FOR LONG BEACH

<P>
Don Barbara and a friend made their way to the visitors' clubhouse at Dodger 
Stadium Monday night where they mugged for a photograph with San Francisco 
Giant first baseman Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to see that picture," said Barbara, who plays first base for Cal 
State Long Beach. "Will Clark is awesome. One of the best." 
</P>
<P>
Clark is high on Barbara's list of heroes, but it's doubtful his picture will 
replace the one Barbara has of New York Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara, a 6-foot-2, 210-pound senior from San Mateo, Calif., has carried 
Mattingly's picture in his uniform pocket for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a superstitious thing," Barbara said. "Wade Boggs eats chicken, and I 
keep Mattingly in my back pocket." 
</P>
<P>
The photo of Mattingly is covered with layers of transparent tape and remains 
untattered despite Barbara's aggressive play. 
</P>
<P>
But pitchers who have faced Barbara this season haven't fared as well. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara is batting .471, best in the nation among players with at least 100 
at-bats. He has five home runs, 50 runs batted in and 23 doubles. He also has 
drawn 42 walks. 
</P>
<P>
"That picture is the first thing I put in my travel bag when we go on the 
road," Barbara said. "A lot of times, I've forgotten to take it out of my 
pocket when I've had my uniform washed. But it never gets ruined because it has 
been covered so much over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara began using Mattingly's picture for good luck when he played at College 
of San Mateo, where he established a school record for hits. 
</P>
<P>
He transferred to Long Beach last season and batted a team-high .366 for the 
49ers, who won the Big West Conference and advanced to the College World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Eye of the Hurricanes: Greg Erickson longed to be a Longhorn from the moment he 
spied the burnt orange color of Texas' uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them in the College World Series on ESPN when I was kid," Erickson said. 
"And I thought, 'Gee, someday it would nice to be in that color.' " 
</P>
<P>
Feeling that proximity might make Texas Coach Cliff Gustafson's heart grow 
fonder, Erickson enrolled at Bacone Junior College in Muskogee, Okla., after 
graduating from Dana Hills High in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he batted .430 with 13 homers and 62 RBIs and, as Erickson hoped, 
the Longhorns came calling with a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson's dream was almost reality -- until he chose the bright orange of 
Miami over Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision," Erickson said. "But Texas was recruiting three 
shortstops. Miami told me I would definitely start." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson is batting .327 with three homers and 42 RBIs. Miami (45-6) is ranked 
first nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Interchangeable parts: There's no shortage of shortstops at Cal State 
Fullerton, where an infield composed entirely of players who played the 
position in high school or community college has helped the Titans to 
first-place in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to get people that could field ground balls," said Fullerton Coach 
Larry Cochell, whose infield committed 89 errors last season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has a .970 fielding percentage in 45 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman third baseman Phil Nevin, who played shortstop at Placentia El Dorado 
High, has 13 errors, but is still learning the position. Nevin missed fall 
practice because he was kicking for the Titan football team. Shortstop Kevin 
Farlow, a junior transfer from USC, has eight errors and junior first baseman 
Steve Sisco, a transfer from Moorpark College, has five. 
</P>
<P>
Senior second baseman Mate Borgogno has been the key performer for the Titan 
defense, reducing his error total from 29 to seven. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is 9-3 in the Big West and has a half-game lead over UC Santa Barbara 
and Fresno State, both 10-5. The Titans play host to UCSB this weekend, play at 
San Jose State before finshing at Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Long shots: Arizona State outfielder Mike Kelly hit three home runs in one game 
against Stanford, but it took him almost a month to complete the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a sophomore from Los Alamitos, hit two homers against the Cardinal on 
March 5 at Palo Alto before the game was suspended after nine innings because 
of darkness with the score 7-7. The game was resumed last weekend at Arizona 
State and Kelly hit a 12th-inning shot over the center-field wall in a 10-9 Sun 
Devil loss. 
</P>
<P>
With 19 homers and 18 stolen bases, Kelly figures to become the second player 
in Pacific 10 history to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases in a season. Former 
Sun Devil Odibe McDowell hit 23 homers and stole 36 bases in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The race is over: Stanford can clinch the Pac-10 Southern Division title this 
weekend when the second-ranked Cardinal plays host to last-place California. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears (3-24) could break the conference record for futility set by USC in 
1985 when the Trojans were 5-25. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (19-5), No. 3 Arizona State (18-9) and No. 6 USC (17-10) figure to 
earn berths in the NCAA tournament, which begins May 24 at sites to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 UCLA (14-16) lost two of three to USC last weekend and has concluded its 
Pac-10 schedule. The Bruins will attempt to catch the eye of the playoff 
selection committee by improving their 18-3 nonconference record in 11 
remaining games. 
</P>
<P>
With three weekends left in the West Coast Conference season, Loyola Marymount 
and Pepperdine are moving toward a showdown for the conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, ranked 12th, is 21-7 and will play host to Santa Clara this weekend. 
Pepperdine (19-8) is at the University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions and Waves will meet in a three-game finale May 18-19 at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
College Baseball Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine first baseman Dan Melendez and Loyola outfielder Joe Ciccarella are 
among the first 10 players invited to try out for the U.S. national team that 
will compete this summer in the Goodwill Games at Seattle and the World 
Championships at Edmonton, Canada. Melendez, the only freshman invitee, is 
batting .347 with nine home runs and 46 RBIs. Ciccarella, a sophomore, is 
batting .368.

LOS ALAMITOS; 
</P>
<P>
APPREHEND MAKES DEBUT TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD McKINZIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the 2-year-old colt Apprehend left Los Alamitos after the 1989 winter 
season, it was certainly no big deal. Apprehend had won only one of nine starts 
and certainly wasn't considered anything special. 
</P>
<P>
But there will be a great deal of attention paid to the son of Merridoc when he 
makes his 1990 local debut in tonight's trials for the Grade I Los Alamitos 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a new and improved Apprehend headlining the first division of the 
trials. The rangy sorrel, who left Los Alamitos last winter as a colt with only 
$18,704 in career earnings, returns tonight as a gelding with $218,264 to his 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
Apprehend has padded his bank account with victories in the El Primero Del Ano 
Derby and the Golden State Derby, a pair of Grade I races held at the recently 
concluded Bay Meadows quarter horse meeting in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
According to his trainer Daryn Charlton, the key to success was the gelding of 
the colt. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year as a 2-year-old, he had his mind on other things besides racing," 
Charlton said. "Now . . . all he has to think about is racing." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's trials have drawn entries from 21 3-year-olds. The 10 fastest 
qualifiers will earn spots in the final of this 440-yard race May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Apprehend figures to be the horse to beat, but will be bucking a great deal of 
history as he goes for his third stakes win. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 years, only one horse, the champion Sgt. Pepper Feature, has 
been able to follow a victory in the Golden State Derby with one in the Los 
Alamitos Derby. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't seem to faze the 26-year-old Charlton, who leads the national 
money standings for quarter horse trainers. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it is with this horse is that if he breaks, he beats them," Charlton 
said. "If he don't, he won't." 
</P>
<P>
Apprehend's main derby rival figures to be a filly he will race in his derby 
trial, Dashin Dee Dee, a multiple stakes winner 
</P>
<P>
A winner of $208,000, Dashin Dee Dee and Apprehend have both drawn the first 
division of the trials, which will be run as tonight's sixth race. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision that has horsemen buzzing, trainer H.L. Hooper has been fined 
$1,000 by the Los Alamitos stewards and suspended for 15 days for failure to 
bring the horse Too Tall Yawl to the receiving barn for a race at the Bay 
Meadows quarter horse meet April 6. 
</P>
<P>
During the suspension, which begins Thursday, Hooper is denied access to the 
grounds at Los Alamitos and he will not be allowed to enter horses in any race 
at the track. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the matter is the condition of the Bay Meadows track. All 
during the recent quarter horse meeting there, horsemen complained about what 
they said was an uneven surface that favored any horse running in one of the 
inside post positions. 
</P>
<P>
When Hooper's horse drew the No. 8 post April 6, the trainer went to the 
stewards and told them he would not run the horse over that part of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Because only eight horses were entered, there were no scratches allowed, so 
when Hooper failed to bring Too Tall Yawl up for the race, he was in violation 
of a California Horse Racing Board rule prohibiting failure to run an entered 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just doing what I thought was best for the horse," said Hooper. "I had 
injured two other 2-year-olds running on the outside of that track and I didn't 
want to hurt another one." 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Danny Cardoza is among those who say that the condition of the track 
should have been taken into consideration in the ruling on Hooper. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, the track at Bay Meadows was as bad as any track I've ever ridden 
on, and I've been riding since 1968," Cardoza said. "Hooper is the wrong guy to 
suspend. They should have suspended the guy taking care of the track at Bay 
Meadows." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper indicated that he would not appeal the decision and will begin serving 
his suspension Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Kip Didericksen is leading the Los Alamitos jockey standings with 10 
victories but it is doubtful that any of them were as memorable as his 
fourth-place finish aboard Dash for Time in the $20,000 Leo Handicap on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Considered one of the top 2-year-olds on the West Coast, Dash for Time was 
leading the 350-yard race when she decided to make an abrupt right turn about 
200 yards from the wire. 
</P>
<P>
She had broken from the outside post in the 10-horse field and by the time she 
hit the halfway mark was racing within inches of the outside rail. 
</P>
<P>
With Didericksen doing all he could to keep Dash for Time from falling over the 
outside fence, the filly still managed to get fourth, just a neck behind winner 
Miss Strikin Jet. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't let her run a jump the last 200 yards and she still only gets beat 
a neck," said a relieved Didericksen after the Leo. "I was thinking of jumping 
off but I couldn't figure out anywhere to land. Besides, she's a good filly and 
I didn't want her going over the rail." 
</P>
<P>
Quarter Horse Notes 
</P>
<P>
For quarter horse fans, insomniacs or both, the replays of the Los Alamitos 
races will be shown each racing night this summer between 12:30 and and 1 a.m. 
on Prime Ticket. The show's host is Steve Arthur. . . . A record triple payoff 
of $26,979.70 was paid to one unidentified triple-ticket bettor last Friday at 
Los Alamitos after he had correctly selected The Dream Date, which paid $23.40 
in the 10th race; Miss Strikin Jet, $19.60 in the 11th race, and Coda Lark, 
$43.20 in the 12th.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS: SAN FERNANDO AGAIN TAKES IT FROM THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key for any team seeking to make it all the way to No. 1 is a batter who 
makes things happen from the No. 1 slot. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three seasons, San Fernando High has had three players who 
excelled in the leadoff position, although in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, outfielder Josh Bergara did it with power, hitting a school-record 
four home runs in league play. Bergara, who now plays at College of the 
Canyons, batted .353, scored 23 runs and stole 10 bases. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, outfielder Jesse Romero did it with a superlative batting average. 
Romero, who plays at Mission College, hit .427 and set a school record with 28 
hits in league play. Romero also scored 29 runs and stole 12 bases. 
</P>
<P>
This year, infielder Richard Sanchez is leading the run-producing charge. 
Sanchez, who is batting .452, has driven in 23 runs and scored 23 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Field of screams: Chatsworth shortstop Tommy Lee should have known that 
something was afoot underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
During practice at home last week, Lee took a bad-hop grounder in the face. A 
day later, in a game against El Camino Real at Chatsworth, Lee took two more 
hard-hit shots to the body, including one that struck him squarely on the chin, 
knocking him down and leaving him temporarily woozy. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said that Lee -- who missed much of the season 
because of an arm injury and rejoined the team over spring break -- already has 
received a season's worth of bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball's really been after his face," Meusborn said. "Maybe he felt like he 
needed an improvement in his looks, but that's a tough way to go about it." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the El Camino Real game, Lee's chin was clearly swollen. 
Meusborn's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to make sure he got all of the rocks out of there," Meusborn said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Oscar goes to . . .: Chatsworth's Reed McMackin might deserve a 
nomination for best acting in a dramatic role. 
</P>
<P>
During Chatsworth's 11-8 loss to El Camino Real last week, McMackin apparently 
was hit by a pitch thrown high and tight. 
</P>
<P>
Or was he? 
</P>
<P>
The sound of impact was a metallic thump, apparently as the ball hit the knob 
of the bat. As McMackin trotted toward first base, the El Camino Real team 
erupted and asked for the base umpire to rule whether the ball had hit the bat 
or McMackin's hand. 
</P>
<P>
As the play was being discussed, McMackin went into his act. He shook the hand, 
cradled it under his arm, bent over in pain, grimaced and swore -- all with his 
back to the plate umpire, who eventually called McMackin back to resume his 
at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
On a last-ditch attempt to convince the plate umpire that he had been hit, 
McMackin held out his arm -- which didn't have a mark on it. 
</P>
<P>
Don't play cards with this guy -- McMackin never cracked a smile. 
</P>
<P>
No luck: Newbury Park's Andy Moffat is one of the few Marmonte League pitchers 
who has challenged league-leading Westlake's disciplined bats. But it hasn't 
earned Moffat any victories. 
</P>
<P>
Moffat, a senior right-hander, pitched eight innings in a 4-3 loss to the 
Warriors on Friday and allowed just three hits and two earned runs. In an 
earlier outing against Westlake, he struck out eight and allowed five hits and 
one earned run. Yet he lost that game, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw two great games," Newbury Park Coach Gary Fabricius said. "He said he 
wanted to pitch against them, so we worked it around in our rotation." 
</P>
<P>
Moffat said he enjoys the challenges posed by Westlake, the top-ranked Southern 
Section 5-A Division team. 
</P>
<P>
"When I pitch against other teams, I don't get into it as much," Moffat said. 
"I like the competition with Westlake, it gets me more excited." 
</P>
<P>
Warriors invited: Westlake's success this season has brought national exposure 
and led to invitations to tournaments as far away as Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (22-1), ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today, has been invited to 
compete in the Colonial Classic in Orlando from April 1-5 and the Upper Deck 
tournament in Anaheim from March 25-28. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera said that the Colonial Classic conflicts with classes and he won't make 
a decision until conferring with administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Homer leaders: Westlake's Mike Lieberthal and Simi Valley's Joe Gordon are tied 
for the state lead in home runs with 13, according to Cal-Hi Sports. 
Fullerton's D. C. Olsen, declared academically ineligible last week, is second 
with 12 and El Segundo's Tate Seefried has 11. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook bleak: Simi Valley (10-11) might miss the playoffs for only the third 
time in Coach Mike Scyphers' 12 years as head coach. Simi Valley (4-6) is 1 1/2 
games behind Royal (5-4) in the battle for the third and final playoff berth 
and must win its final two league games against Westlake (22-1, 10-0) and 
Camarillo (10-11-1, 3-6). 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers failed to qualify for the playoffs in 1979, Scyphers' first year, 
and in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: Dave Landaker, Royal's super sophomore who was hitting .391, 
still is recovering from a pulled groin muscle he sustained in an 11-4 loss to 
Westlake two weeks ago. Landaker, a right fielder, was injured while attempting 
to catch a fly ball on the hill in right field at Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Landaker's loss could prove even more costly as Royal (14-9, 5-4) battles for 
its first playoff berth in at least seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really missing his bat," first-year Coach Dan Maye said. "He may be back 
on Friday, but it's all in the doctors' hands now." 
</P>
<P>
New attitude: Beware of flying objects next fall at Montclair Prep football 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties plan to introduce the forward pass -- seldom used in last season's 
offense -- to their attack in the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely going to throw the ball next year," Coach George Giannini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach will cause some changes, he said. Last year's quarterback, 
5-foot-9 Leland Sparks, will move to flanker and Mike Lincavage, a 6-foot, 
165-pound junior, will move to quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties threw the ball 43 times and ran it 504 times in 13 games last fall 
when Michael Jones and Derek Sparks logged 224 and 210 carries, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has graduated and will attend USC in the fall, leaving Sparks, who gained 
1,944 yards and ran for 32 touchdowns, in the Montclair backfield. Giannini 
assures that Sparks will continue to get his carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's ready for a big year," Giannini said.

WEIL LOSES SCORELESS STREAK BUT TIES RECORD FOR CAREER VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kym Weil tied a Southern Section record Tuesday with her 81st career victory as 
the Hart High girls' softball team coasted to a 9-2 Foothill League victory 
over visiting Schurr. 
</P>
<P>
Weil (20-1 this season), a four-year starter, allowed her first run since April 
3 -- a string of 80 scoreless innings and 11 shutouts -- before Schurr scored 
two runs in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Hart (21-2, 7-0 in league play) led, 3-0, and Weil was en route 
to pitching a two-hitter with 11 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Weil's career record is 81-15. Tuesday's victory tied Weil with De De Weinman, 
who had 81 wins for Gahr High from 1986-89. 
</P>
<P>
Weil, who has 14 shutouts this season, has struck out 240 of the 523 batters

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;

CORONADO BEATS ST. AUGUSTINE, CLOSES ON FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Augustine High is still in the driver's seat, but Coronado just forced the 
driver to take a closer look in the rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The City Harbor League teams were already familiar with one another before 
Tuesday, having met twice in league and once in the Lion's Tournament, with St. 
Augustine winning twice. But Coronado evened the series, scoring three runs in 
the seventh inning to break a 3-3 tie and give the Islanders a clutch, 6-3 
victory that kept them in the league race. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado jumped to a 3-0 lead in the top of the first, then watched St. 
Augustine's creep back into the game with single runs in the second, third and 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them before the game that three (runs) wouldn't win it," Coronado Coach 
Ron Smock said. 
</P>
<P>
By winning, Coronado (14-7-1, 6-3) bought some time in its attempt to catch St. 
Augustine (13-0, 7-2). There are three games left. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us some momentum," Smock said. "This was a big win for us. We could 
have folded, but we hung in there." 
</P>
<P>
No one hung tighter than Smock's son, Kyle, a freshman who had struck out twice 
and popped to second in his first three at-bats. With one out in the seventh, 
Smock, the first batter to face reliever George Inzunza, hit a ball hard to 
left field, and it took a Coronado drop for a double. Jason Fledderjohn was 
intentionally walked, and Joel Franklin hit a triple to right, scoring Smock 
and Fledderjohn. Franklin scored the final run on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"When the little guy can come in and get a double like that, that tells the 
other guys something," said Ron Smock, whose son is 5-feet-4. 
</P>
<P>
Mike (Buck) Bryant pitched 6 1/3 innings for the Saints and gave up three runs 
on five hits before Inzunza, who shut out Coronado, 2-0, the last time they 
played, came in. 
</P>
<P>
"We got some clutch hitting. We didn't let up," said Fledderjohn, who pitched 
an eight-hitter, singled twice, walked twice and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado's other league losses were to Marian Catholic and Clairemont, both 
teams they must meet again. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't panic," said Mike Stephenson, St. Augustine coach. "We just need to 
execute a little better." 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine still has the enviable league-leading record, something 
Stephenson finds relief in. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be in our position than theirs," he said. "We don't have to depend 
on anyone but ourselves, and they need help from someone else. We don't have to 
worry about that." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: TOP ATHLETES EAGER TO TRY FAST TRACK AT UCSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What started out as a "last chance" track and field meet for college athletes 
to gain national qualifying times is turning into an international gathering of 
world-class talent. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego is host for the meet at 10 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It was designed as an opportunity for college athletes to qualify for their 
national meets. But word got around to some top-notch talent that UCSD's new 
state-of-the-art track was again going to be made available. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Brazilian Joaquim Cruz and American Ocky Clark wanted in on the 800-meter 
run. Likewise, Steve Scott, the American record-holder in the mile, and Dub 
Myers, the former NCAA champion from Oregon, wanted to run the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians Ray Lazdins and Rob McManus, conveniently training in the area, 
decided to enter the discus. 
</P>
<P>
But the kicker might be a small contingent of Estonian javelin throwers, who 
came to California to begin training for the European season. Sulev Lepik, 
Meelis Jaarv, Toivo Moorast and Donald Sild will compete in the their 
specialty. 
</P>
<P>
They will also be holding a javelin clinic this afternoon at 1:30 at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Juri Tamm, bronze medalist for the USSR in the hammer throw in Seoul, will also 
be on hand today. He and world-renowned coach Anatoli Bondartchouk conducted a 
hammer clinic Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys (Soviets) are the lords of hammer throwing," said Tony Salerno, 
UCSD throwing coach. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Point Loma Nazarene freshman Ronnie Skold won six events -- the 100, 
200, long jump and triple jump, the 100 hurdles and 400 relay -- at the first 
City Collegiate Championships at UCSD. He could conceivably enter eight -- 
adding the 400 hurdles and 1,600 relay -- in the NAIA District III meet but 
probably will not enter the sprints. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State junior Mike Magruder had just two at-bats with one single and a 
run batted in heading into his first start in Saturday's opening game of a 
doubleheader against Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Magruder responded by going two for four with a double and a home run -- rare 
because of the way it happened. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth inning with two on, Magruder was instructed to bunt to move the 
runners over, but Wyoming was thinking the same the thing and had both the 
first baseman and third baseman charging. 
</P>
<P>
Magruder squared to bunt, noticed what was going on and pulled his bat back. 
The result was a three-run homer over the left center field fence. 
</P>
<P>
What are the odds of such an occurence? Ask Magruder. He's an engineering major 
who graduated first in his class at both Ellensburg High in Washington and Taft 
Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Collins of the University of San Diego was named the District VIII coach of 
the year by the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Assn. Collins is under 
consideration for national coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 years at USD, Collins is 262-119, including 21-5 this year. The Toreros, 
champions of the West Coast Conference, are ranked 17th and should be selected 
for the NCAA Tournament next week. 
</P>
<P>
The women's tennis teams at SDSU (ranked 12th) and USD (14th) are expected to 
receive NCAA bids this week. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU won the Big West Conference title for the fifth year in a row last week in 
Ojai. Carol Plunkett was chosen the Big West coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
USD finished second in the WCC tournament, but not until Pepperdine's Ginger 
Helgeson defeated USD's Sakolwan Kacharoen, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, in the singles final 
Sunday at the San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament was held two weekends ago at St. Mary's, but rain caused the 
delay of the singles and doubles finals. Kacharoen, a sophomore from Bangkok 
and seeded seventh, could have given USD a tie if she had upset top-seeded 
Helgeson, who is ranked fourth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In the two-year existence of the Pacific Coast Volleyball Conference, Nate 
Brown of UCSD has been selected the player of the year twice. And Brown is just 
a sophomore. UCSD went undefeated for the second year in a row and won the PCVC 
Tournament Saturday at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's women's water polo team is No. 1 ranked and seeded first heading into 
the USA National Tournament this weekend at Brown University. UCSD is 21-0-1.

WEDBUSH SALE LOOKS BAD FOR GREAT AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wedbush Corp., Great American Bank's largest shareholder, has sold part of its 
stock in the savings and loan, a move that observers say may be a negative sign 
for the besieged S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
According to proxy materials mailed recently to shareholders, Wedbush had 
reduced its holdings in Great American as of April 17 to 3,657,923 shares, or 
15.3% of the 23,969,968 total Great American shares outstanding. A year ago 
Wedbush owned 4,074,023 shares, or 17% of the total outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush Chairman Ed Wedbush, who is a member of Great American's board of 
directors, and Vice President Philip LoBue were unavailable for comment Tuesday 
on when, why or at what price the shares were sold. Sources close to Great 
American say Wedbush has been selling shares in recent weeks, however. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the sale price, Wedbush has taken huge losses on its investment in 
Great American. The firm is believed to have paid a total of $45 million, or an 
average of about $11 per share, for the 4 million-plus shares it owned a year 
ago. With Great American shares now selling at $3 each, Wedbush's loss on its 
remaining holdings alone could exceed $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Wedbush Corp. is the parent company of Wedbush Morgan 
Securities, a stock brokerage. According to LoBue, all Great American shares 
are owned by the parent company. Wedbush Morgan Securities is separately 
capitalized and in no financial danger, LoBue said, despite the parent's huge 
losses on the S&amp;L stock. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gordon, a stock analyst with PaineWebber investment bankers in New York, 
said Wedbush's stock sale is "clearly a negative" for Great American. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is an insider and he's actively selling, a member of the board of 
directors and he's shrunk his position," Gordon said. "That's an interesting 
issue for the stock." 
</P>
<P>
Shares in Great American, the nation's eighth largest S&amp;L with assets of 
$15.9 billion, have taken a beating in recent months as the S&amp;L has been 
progressively weakened by problem loans in Arizona and elsewhere in the 
Southwest. While shares closed down $.25 at $3 per share in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Tuesday, they have traded as high as $14.875 each over the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Great American reported a 1989 loss of $263.4 million for 1989 and 
said its capital position had weakened to the point where it faces a possible 
regulatory seizure unless it can raise $350 million or sell itself in part or 
whole to an outside institution by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
An insider stock sale such as Wedbush's could lend support to the pessimistic 
view held by many Great American observers that the S&amp;L is having a tough 
time finding a buyer. However, others speculated that Wedbush may have had to 
sell stock to satisfy margin calls or to reduce an over-concentration of 
investment in Great American if some of the shares are held by Wedbush's 
employee pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's annual shareholders meeting will be held May 24 at Copley 
Symphony Hall in downtown San Diego. The meeting could be a stormy event, given 
shareholder dissatisfaction over Great American's stock price slide. A sign of 
that dissatisfaction is the fact that Great American and its management have 
been slapped with five shareholder lawsuits since October 1989, according to 
the proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
The proxy statement also says that Great American Chairman Gordon Luce earned a 
base salary of $598,540 in 1989, a 7% raise from the previous year. But Luce's 
total cash compensation in 1989 declined because he received no incentive 
bonus, which in 1988 totaled $68,371. 
</P>
<P>
Great American President Roger Lindland received base pay of $355,131 in 1989, 
a 9% raise from the previous year. But his total compensation also declined 
because he received no incentive bonus, which in 1988 totaled $29,934.

ALICE KAHN: RENEWING OUR VOWS TO SAVE EARTH 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Earth Day? It's all over now but the polluting. I'm collecting Earth 
Day nostalgia here. Remember your vows to drive less, water your lawn less, eat 
lower on the food chain. How are you doing? Phone: 1-500-EAT DIRT. 
</P>
<P>
I was born again on Earth Day. I'll tell you about it, and then you can recycle 
this column or wrap it around your water heater. 
</P>
<P>
My town celebrated Earth Day a day early. My town is infamous for being a 
little offbeat. According to a recent poll, 37% of the people in my town have 
had sex with a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
My town used to be called The People's Republic of Berkeley. Now, it is simply 
Planet Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Day Minus One started out on Planet Berkeley much as it did in your town. 
I was driving my daughter to her softball game. She would end up hitting a 
homer that day for Plywood and Lumber Supplies. But they would still lose to 
Quantum Consulting. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to the park, she said, "Do I have to go to that stupid Earth Day 
festival with you after the game?" It was not what I had hoped for. I turned on 
the radio and heard something like: 
</P>
<P>
"For the children's sake, don't pollute. This Earth Day message was brought to 
you by the good folks at Douse Chemical, where we make people green." 
</P>
<P>
We picked up Sarah Wilson, 11, for the baseball game. "I know someone who's 
going to Earth Day," she said. "My friend's mother is dragging her." 
</P>
<P>
I left the game and was driving home when my car was stopped by a man dressed 
as garbage. It was the Berkeley Earth Day Parade, a cross between 
situationalist art and hometown pride. Kind of like: "Leave It to Fellini." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the parade were the nursery school kids, whose parents can still tell 
them what to do. They were dressed like trees in greenface and covered with 
branches. They were followed by a squad of tykes on bikes -- moms and dads 
pedaling, kids in backpacks, bike seats and bike carriers. 
</P>
<P>
On one float, a woman scantily dressed as Mother Earth stood inside a globe 
doing her own weird dance thing. The man dressed as garbage ran up to a car 
full of bleached blondes who had wandered onto the parade route. (They were 
probably refugees from one of those towns with obedient kids and manicured 
lawns.) He threw himself on the hood of their car and started screaming, "Save 
the planet! Save the planet!" 
</P>
<P>
I know what they were thinking: Send him back to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The top float prize should have gone to the most unique form of alternative 
energy I've ever seen. It was a car with a woman in black leather and chain 
jewelry riding on the roof. She was cracking a whip lightly on the backs of 
four strong men in loin cloths who were actually pulling the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
On Earth Day morning, I woke up and looked into the back yard. Two strange 
lumps appeared to be moving in the tall, unkempt weeds that I like to think of 
as our Native Plants Area. The man dressed as garbage would feel right at home 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The lumps were smaller than dogs. They were furry and speckled. They couldn't 
stand up. Two baby fawns had been born in our back yard. 
</P>
<P>
I woke the girls, and we spent Earth Day staring out the window. Sometime when 
we looked away, the fawns disappeared, and we saw a proud doe walking down the 
street toward the regional park. 
</P>
<P>
I took it as an Earth Day sign to let Mother Nature do her own wild thing. You 
don't find baby fawns on your cultivated lawns. Here on Planet Berkeley, we're 
saving the urban wilderness.

SEINFELD AMUSES WITHOUT ABUSING; 
</P>
<P>
AS HEADLINER FOR THE WELLNESS COMMUNITY'S BENEFIT SHOW AT THE IMPROV, HE WAS 
FUNNY, BUT STAYED CLEAR OF DANGER.

<P>
Jerry Seinfeld may be the ideal comic for a benefit show. He's a clever 
generalist, relaxed and nice, very nice. He does not offend gray-haired 
mothers, frighten small children or get too wiggy for the working crowd. 
</P>
<P>
As headliner for the Wellness Community's $100-a-plate dinner and show at the 
Improv here Monday, he was funny without jagged edges. His 35-minute 
performance amused but stayed clear of danger. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Kinison fans might have been horrified, but not the organizers of the 
event, who were trying to raise money to open a Santa Ana branch of the Santa 
Monica-based cancer support group (see accompanying story). Seinfeld's 
gentlemanly routine lacked toxic brilliance but had several bright, quirky 
moments. Besides, it kept in step with the, uh, wellness feeling of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Seinfeld's most provocative bit dealt with horses, like how is it we can turn 
them into glue? And what about horse trailers: Do they have to be that 
undignified, with the horse's derriere always hanging out? Doesn't that bother 
them, make them embarrassed? That's about as ugly as it got. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the time, Seinfeld stayed with tried-and-true material. There were 
some takes on Orange County -- particularly Irvine, "the kind of town where 
everybody seems like they got a haircut that day." Strolling up and down Irvine 
streets brings to mind "architects' renderings, where everything's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
From there, it wasn't too far a reach to the Santa Ana Freeway and a bit on 
traffic. Seinfeld wondered about the future: When they say it's going to get 
worse, "do they mean it will start going backwards?" 
</P>
<P>
Other familiar passages centered on shopping, being a kid and the differences 
between men and women. Seinfeld found some interesting slants. When he visits 
the supermarket, for instance, he sometimes reflects while walking down the 
aisles and listening to the music: "Hmmm, I don't think I have that album." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wolfberg served as host for the evening, providing several brief 
monologues during the show, which also featured Steve Shaefer and Hiram Kasten. 
</P>
<P>
Once you got accustomed to Wolfberg's delivery (he does some unsettling things 
with his bulgy eyes, and finishes most of his jokes with a sonic exclamation 
mark that makes it sound as though his vocal chords are looking for a way out 
of his head), there were riffs to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the theme of the benefit, Wolfberg focused on health and 
medical routines, many of which dealt with childbirth. Asserting that the 
Lamaze technique was developed by a "disciple of Josef Mengele," Wolfberg said 
that asking a woman to have natural childbirth is "like asking a man to 
tolerate a vasectomy by hyperventilating." 
</P>
<P>
The husband's role, meanwhile, is to "keep your wife from taking medication. 
When she begs for it, you just say 'no.' "

LOVELESS LEFT POINTLESS AS EMOTIONS ELUDE HER 
</P>

<P>
As Patty Loveless was singing Monday night at the Crazy Horse Steak House and 
Saloon, more than a couple of gentlemen in the audience looked at the 
down-home-glamorous lass and shouted: "You're beautiful!" Between that and the 
ring on her finger, one would guess that hers is not entirely the most apt of 
names. But there was something lacking in Loveless' enjoyable -- but nearly 
entirely forgettable -- 80 minutes of country-lite. 
</P>
<P>
The late Buddy Rich, if memory serves, referred to country as "the sound of 
ignorance," and within the limited confines of his purview, he may have had a 
point. Most country music is simple stuff, with neither lyrics nor notes 
generally requiring a degree in think-ology. But, perhaps because he had no 
particular flair for it himself, Rich never realized that the music could 
contain a wealth of understanding and expression about the human condition. 
Within its simple framework can be shadings and inflections as illuminating as 
any rarefied music. 
</P>
<P>
Those personalizing details were missing from Loveless' show. The Kentucky 
native seemed earnest in her delivery and displayed a capable voice in her 
18-song set. Actually, it may have been those songs, more than a lack of 
emotion on Loveless' part, that hampered things. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn from her three albums and a pending new one, most of the tunes sounded as 
if they had been glopped out of the same Nashville Jell-O mold, being 
indistinguishable and not much to bite into. Among these were "Lonely Days, 
Lonely Nights"; the recent single, "The Lonely Side of Love"; the mock-rock 
"Blue Side of Town"; the new "Blue Memories," and the hit "Timber, I'm Falling 
in Love." Far removed from country's grit, the latter's lyrics ("Right time, 
right place / Right body, right face") would have sounded inane even in a '70s 
disco. 
</P>
<P>
Though still several dry counties removed from the emotional landscape Kathy 
Mattea had explored on the Crazy Horse stage the previous Monday, a few songs 
indicated that Loveless could develop a more individual voice. She has a strong 
upper register, and when she let her high notes fly freer on "The Night's Too 
Long" and the bluegrass ballad "Slow Healing Heart," they came close to 
soaring. Loveless' finest moment came during "Baby's Gone Blues," a moody 
atmospheric number that she infused with a melancholy ache nearly worthy of Don 
Everly.

NEW KENT STATE MEMORIAL STIRS 20-YEAR-OLD ANGER

"It sounded like balloons bursting." 
</P>
<P>
June Romeo had just come out of English class. "I was still carrying my books." 
She gathered with the other students in the commons, the grassy area on the 
Kent State University campus between Taylor Hall and what used to be the ROTC 
building. Two nights before it had been burned down. Now 100 National Guardsmen 
surrounded the site. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bright day. A large crowd was listening as speakers denounced the war 
in Vietnam and the U.S. invasion of Cambodia. When students defied an order to 
disperse, the Guard fired tear gas into the crowd. Romeo started running. 
Everyone was running. Almost 2,000 students. It was wild. The guardsmen 
followed them over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
Allison Krause was there too, running. A day earlier, Krause and some friends 
had come upon a guardsman, one of hundreds called onto the campus to restore 
order after a day of protest and vandalism. Someone stuck a flower in his 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
"An officer of the guard came by and ordered the man to take the flower out of 
his gun," says Doris Krause, Allison's mother, "and Allison yelled back at the 
officer that flowers were better than bullets." 
</P>
<P>
The words, repeated by those who were there, emblazoned later on signs and 
remembered in poetry, are engraved on Allison Krause's tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
Flower power was not yet dead at the start of May, 1970. The '60s were not yet 
over. That epoch, say many who were at Kent State, ended May 4 at 12:25 p.m. 
when the National Guard opened fire on college students with live ammunition, 
killing four and wounding nine. "It was a very important event in United States 
history," says Dean Kahler, whose spine was severed in the shooting, sentencing 
him to a wheelchair for life. 
</P>
<P>
"People say it was the end of the '60s, but it was also the beginning of the 
apathy that followed all into the 1970s and 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a demarcation point, a turning point," says Michael Tarr, a filmmaker who 
was a 20-year-old Kent State student in 1970. "When you look at the '60s there 
was a kind of brilliance and hope . . . . Then you realize that the very next 
year, it was over -- physically and spiritually. Over the last 20 years you 
have Nixon and Watergate, a time of debacle under the Reagan era . . . . This 
was the end of a time. It broke the spirit and period of hope . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Feel Anger 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, the wounds for many have not healed, the anger has not 
faded. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the university will dedicate a $200,000 granite memorial to the 
tragedy, a memorial Doris Krause calls "too little and too late." 
</P>
<P>
"All through the years they have done as little as possible and in every way 
have tried to blot out what happened," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry and I always will be," says Elaine Miller Holstein, whose son, 
Jeffrey Miller, was among those killed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny," she says of the memorial, a scaled-down version of the $1-million 
memorial originally proposed. "It would have made me feel great . . . but it 
took an awful lot of arm twisting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 20 years now. The university has always ducked taking any 
responsibility when the right thing would have been to make peace . . . . It 
has been such a hassle. They have been so ungiving. For every inch they put up 
a fight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students, Guard Clash 
</P>
<P>
The students, followed by the National Guard, ran over Blanket Hill and spread 
onto the football practice field and a parking lot. Hurling curses, insults and 
rocks, the students held their ground at several points. Some threw tear gas 
canisters back at the guardsmen. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the outnumbered Guard members later said they feared students would 
charge them and seize their weapons. "I was scared to death," guardsman Barry 
Morris later testified. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nine students who were wounded that day, Joseph Lewis was closest to the 
guns. He was 20 feet away, near an abstract metal sculpture that still bears a 
bullet hole. "He was giving the finger," says Jerry M. Lewis, a Kent State 
sociology professor who was there and who teaches a course on May 4 and its 
aftermath. "He got shot for giving the finger." 
</P>
<P>
There is a photograph: In it the students are facing the National Guard in the 
commons, before the tear gas canisters were fired, before hell broke loose. It 
is a quiet scene compared to what would follow, a composed tableaux. In the 
student front lines, facing the guardsmen, is Jeffrey Miller, one of the 
protest leaders, a dark-haired youth in a Western-styled shirt. Not far away 
from him, several yards to his left, is Mary Ann Vecchio, a 14-year-old 
runaway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange, isn't it," says Alan Canfora, one of the protest leaders, "that 
they should be standing so close to each other." 
</P>
<P>
In less than an hour, on the other side of Taylor Hall and the tumult about to 
begin, across the chasm that some say divides the '60s from the era that 
followed, Miller and Vecchio would be frozen together forever in memory. A 
Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph by John P. Filo was taken of Vecchio kneeling 
over Miller's body, her arms outstretched, her face contorted in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after Miller's body was taken away and the students were standing about, 
stunned, Tom Miller, Thomas Aquinus to his friends, picked up one of the two 
discarded black protest flags that Canfora had brought to the demonstration. 
Miller dipped the flag in the dead student's blood. 
</P>
<P>
"He soaked his own T-shirt in the blood, too," says Roseann Knepp, Canfora's 
sister and a sophomore in 1970. "He was flinging the blood on people and 
shouting, 'Here, take it! Go home and remember what happened!' " Some details 
Romeo can't remember. Others she can't talk about. She saw a student -- Canfora 
-- taunting the guardsmen. He was marching toward them, waving his black flag. 
"The black flag of anarchy," she calls it. 
</P>
<P>
Canfora says it was something else. Sitting last week on the grassy knoll above 
the commons, within view of the granite memorial he calls a "gross insult" to 
the memory of the dead, Canfora said: "I hadn't yet read . . . the great 
anarchist writers. I was just basically a young kid who was very upset about 
the war. I think, if anything, the black flag symbolized the despair that I 
felt." 
</P>
<P>
He had a friend, Bill Caldwell, who was killed in Vietnam, he says. "He was 19. 
I'd attended his funeral 10 days before May 4. And then when Nixon six days 
later announces he's expanding the war into another country . . . . That's why 
I was out there." 
</P>
<P>
There is another photograph, similar to the famous one of the Chinese student 
in Tian An Men Square facing off the line of tanks, of Canfora almost alone out 
in the practice field facing a line of guardsmen who are kneeling, taking aim 
with their weapons. Canfora is defiantly holding up his flag. He kept it high, 
he says, right up until they shot him. 
</P>
<P>
They did not open fire on the practice field, though. After about 10 minutes 
facing the defiant students, the guardsmen strode back up Blanket Hill to stand 
before a concrete structure called The Pagoda. Then they turned and aimed their 
weapons again. This time shots rang out. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo heard balloons bursting. Everything is jumbled in her mind now. It was 
jumbled then. She did not immediately grasp what was happening. "It was beyond 
belief," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The students were not totally blameless and the National Guard was not totally 
blameless," says Romeo, whose father was in the Air Force and who says she has 
always been "pro military." But there was no reason for the guard to shoot, she 
says. "We were in blue jeans and T-shirts and they were in heavy boots and they 
had rifles and gas masks." Students were throwing stones, she admits. "But the 
Guard was not surrounded. They had avenues of retreat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bullet in Building 
</P>
<P>
The initial shots are believed to have been fired over the heads of the 
students. One bullet was found in an apartment building a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were firing blanks," says Canfora. But just as he ducked behind 
a tree a bullet tore into his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
People were falling to the ground, running, taking cover. Kahler was shot in 
the back as he lay prone. The parking lot was half full of cars. "The cars 
shielded us," says Knepp. "Without them more people would've been killed." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Lewis could tell from the sound and the smoke that it was live 
ammunition. He was an Army veteran. But many of the students did not know; it 
was inconceivable to them that the guardsmen were shooting real bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis ran out of the line of fire and hid behind bushes. After 13 seconds the 
shooting stopped. Sixty-one rounds of ammunition had been fired. "A student 
came up to me and said, 'They're shooting blanks,' " Lewis recalls. "I said no, 
they're real bullets. Then I indicated to him Sandra Scheuer who was lying on 
the ground nearby and who I later learned was dead." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sites of Shootings 
</P>
<P>
"This is Jeffrey Miller's spot," says Lewis, walking through the parking lot. 
"Allison Krause was shot here." Crisscrossing the asphalt, he points to the 
ground near a Toyota Corolla. "William Schroeder was shot here." And then, a 
little further: "Sandy Scheuer was shot here." 
</P>
<P>
Of those killed, only Krause and Miller were active participants in the rally. 
Schroeder was himself an ROTC student who got caught in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. Scheuer was walking to a 1 p.m. class. 
</P>
<P>
A state grand jury found that the guardsmen acted in self defense but concluded 
that the weapons they carried were "not appropriate" for quelling campus 
disorder. Twenty-five people, mostly students, were indicted on charges 
stemming from the disturbances. Two pleaded guilty to first-degree rioting, and 
one was convicted of interfering with a fireman. The other charges were 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
It took three years for the Justice Department to reverse an earlier decision 
and open a federal grand jury probe of the shootings. After 10 days of 
testimony, eight indicted National Guardsmen were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded and the parents of the dead agreed to an out-of-court settlement of 
their civil lawsuit in 1979. They were awarded $675,000, which was split among 
them. In addition, state officials and the National Guardsmen issued a 
statement of regret. "It's a well-known fact that they did give us an apology," 
Doris Krause says. "It's printed and it's signed by all the guardsmen and the 
governor, but it isn't what you would call a complete apology . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still angry that my daughter is dead and their lack, their complete lack, 
of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Persistent Question 
</P>
<P>
How best to remember the dead? This is the question that has plagued the 
university and those close to the four students since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the most visible memorial had been two trees planted in the parking 
lot after the shootings and a nearby tombstone-size granite marker that was 
erected in 1975 by members of the faculty, after a plaque donated in 1971 by 
B'nai B'rith Hillel was stolen. A candlelight march and all-night vigil are 
held on campus each year. And there have been commemorative programs, including 
"alternative" commemorations with speakers such as Jane Fonda, the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson and Ron Kovic, who appeared on stage in 1974 with Kahler -- two men in 
wheelchairs because of the war. 
</P>
<P>
This year the university announced four permanent scholarships established in 
the slain students' honor. But Canfora, who heads an organization that he says 
will hold demonstrations on campus Friday during the dedication ceremony, 
accuses the university of bowing to "conservative pressure" and purposely 
playing down the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
His organization, the Kent May 4 Center, is raising funds for a larger campus 
memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Originally the memorial, which was designed by Chicago architect Bruno Ast, was 
not to feature the names of the dead and wounded. But after Martin and Sarah 
Scheuer, the parents of slain Sandy Scheuer, met with University President 
Michael Schwartz on Wednesday and asked that the names be included, he 
announced that a granite marker would be erected near the memorial 
</P>
<P>
"The plaque will speak to what happened here at Kent, while Bruno Ast's design 
will speak to the larger issue of the disruption going on in our country at 
that time and the impact the events here had on our nation," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
The abstract memorial, erected on a wooded hillside overlooking the commons and 
the parking lot, is designed as a place of reflection. The words "inquire, 
learn and reflect" are carved on its surface. Flowing down the hillside into 
the commons area are 58,175 daffodils symbolizing the U.S. servicemen who died 
in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who co-chaired the memorial commission appointed by Schwartz, says it is 
a mistake to think of the Ast design alone as the memorial. "I think we're 
dedicating a whole memorial complex," he said, indicating the commons, the 
parking lot and Blanket Hill are also included. 
</P>
<P>
Along with guests such as former presidential candidate George S. McGovern, 
Dean Kahler will speak at the dedication Friday, as will the parents of slain 
student William Schroeder. The Scheuers say they will come to campus but will 
likely not take part in planned ceremonies. But Holstein won't be there. "I 
just haven't been able to be as forgiving as Dean Kahler for instance," she 
says. "To me they have taken away a part of my life, my son, his whole life, 
his whole future, any family he might have had. There was no need for that." 
</P>
<P>
Krause will not attend either. When the university in the late 1970s erected a 
gym on part of the site where the incident occurred despite strenuous protests, 
"my late husband vowed never to go back," she says. "And I didn't see any 
reason to go back myself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People as Memorial 
</P>
<P>
How to remember the dead? 
</P>
<P>
"To me," says Romeo, "the true memorial is in the people who go there every 
year and stand on vigil. There is not enough money in the world to buy 
something like that." 
</P>
<P>
To her this year's activities, with all of the media and the controversy, have 
an unappealing "circus atmosphere." All of the activities and the size and form 
of the granite structure do not matter to her. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there are living memorials, wrought from the lives of the people who 
survived May 4. 
</P>
<P>
Tarr, the filmmaker who sees the Kent State shootings as an important signpost 
in American history, still gets emotional talking about it. He made a 
documentary about the shootings in 1970. Now he's returning to the subject in a 
feature film. "For me there's been sort of a continued obsession with relating 
to that time and what went awry and how that time relates to today in terms of 
where the country is, where the people are, what society is like," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Canfora, who has a master's degree in library science, has spent much of the 
last 20 years concerned with May 4 issues, giving lectures and leading 
campaigns for what he considers a suitable memorial. He says he still dreams of 
a resurgence in student activism. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my friends, Jeff Miller, was killed," he says, explaining why he has 
not been able to put the past behind him. "The last time I saw him he was lying 
in an ambulance dead with a bullet in his head . . . . This is the sort of 
situation I have not been able to turn my back on and ignore. I have felt an 
obligation to speak for those who can't speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The shootings have changed Romeo's life too. As a student, she says, she had 
mixed feelings about Vietnam at the time of the shooting, and she left Kent 
State the following year. Partly, she says, that was because of her own 
immaturity, her inability to decide what she wanted to do with her life. But 
also it was because of the emotional pain of dealing with what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came back the following term it was almost as if nothing had 
happened," she said. There still were demonstrations, but now there was a 
subtle difference. Also, she said, she heard comments about the dead that she 
thought were awful. "You hear people saying things like, 'They deserved it.' " 
</P>
<P>
After a stint selling insurance, she enrolled in another college and became a 
nurse. Things changed for her when, while working at a hospital in Cleveland, 
James A. Rhodes, who had been the governor who dispatched the National Guard, 
was admitted to intensive care. "I wanted so badly to go in there and tell him 
things and instill the terror in him that he instilled in us," she says. "I 
went home that day early because I didn't want to be in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
But reliving those emotions made her think about what she had done with her 
life in the years since Kent State. "We tend to fall into our middle-class 
complacency," she says. "I decided I won't be silent again." 
</P>
<P>
Now she's back at the university, seeking a graduate degree in education and 
teaching and also running a literacy program with some of her students in a 
poor Cleveland neighborhood. She says she tries to teach her students about 
social responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
This is her memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm planting seeds," she says.

FIGHT OR TALK? BLACK YOUTHS IN S. AFRICA TAKE HARD LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOWETO, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down the street from Nelson Mandela's home, the prospects for a negotiated 
peace in troubled South Africa seemed especially dim one recent rainy 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is no time to compromise with the enemy," 17-year-old Freedom Kwinana was 
telling two young friends. "If a person treats you badly, don't show him you 
are fair. You show him you are radical." 
</P>
<P>
Briefcases are replacing bombs as the weapons of liberation for Mandela and 
other seasoned leaders of the African National Congress. And the world eagerly 
awaits today's start of the talks between the ANC and the government, hoping 
for the first black-white negotiations in the history of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But in the poverty-stricken townships, and even on Mandela's own middle-class 
block in Soweto, hundreds of thousands of black youths are angry and impatient. 
Hardened by daily clashes with the police, they doubt the professed good 
intentions of a white government that has oppressed the black majority since 
long before they were born. 
</P>
<P>
Now Mandela's ANC faces the difficult task of trying to persuade these 
disgruntled youngsters that the time has come for talking -- and, yes, even 
compromise -- with "the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
ANC leaders admit privately that the country's peace depends on it. 
</P>
<P>
"The youth we have to contend with out there, and the ordinary people too, are 
completely cynical about this government's intentions," said Cheryl Carolus, a 
leader of the United Democratic Front anti-apartheid coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"These youth are not ultra-leftists. They're the people against whom the might 
of the state is still being unleashed," added Carolus, 33, the youngest ANC 
delegate to today's talks. "Peace is quite an alien concept for our young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk has abruptly changed the political climate in 
recent months by removing restrictions on black activists, and he has invited 
his government's enemies to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, freed in February after 27 years in prison, says he has been impressed 
by De Klerk's initiatives, and he and other ANC leaders are willing to talk 
with the government about the ANC's conditions for negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
But for many young radicals who see nothing changing in their townships, this 
sudden willingness to talk seems premature. 
</P>
<P>
"The African National Congress used to say it would never return to this 
country to talk to the government -- only to liberate us," complained Abel 
Zwane, 19, who attends high school on Mandela's block. "But now they are coming 
back to talk. And liberation is no nearer." 
</P>
<P>
Zwane and Kwinana have joined the ANC rival Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), 
whose no-compromise approach to the government's entreaties is appealing to 
increasing numbers of young blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the 71-year-old dean of anti-apartheid activists, "is like a father to 
us, and we respect him," Zwane said. 
</P>
<P>
But children don't always obey their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought when he came out of prison everything would change," Zwane 
explained. "But so far we see nothing." 
</P>
<P>
South Africa today is dotted with signs of youthful distrust of the government 
and discontent with the pace of change. 
</P>
<P>
"Viva No Surrender," reads the freshly painted graffiti on one of the concrete 
walls ringing the expensive white homes in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away, in the township of Tembisa, an ANC-aligned youth organization 
announced the other day that it was reintroducing so-called people's courts, 
the notorious neighborhood tribunals born in the bloody township unrest of 
1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
A private survey of 18- to 25-year-old blacks earlier this month concluded that 
the ANC's willingness to talk to the government "could pose credibility 
problems" for it. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those surveyed said they distrust whites and want De Klerk to step 
down, something he has refused to do. And some said they identify more closely 
with the hard-line position of the PAC than the more moderate ANC. 
</P>
<P>
The black youth of today were in the front line of the ANC's violent 
grass-roots struggle during the 1980s, when thousands died as ANC followers 
used limpet mines, street committees and people's courts to defy Pretoria and 
try to make the country ungovernable. 
</P>
<P>
That uprising was quashed by the South African government, which used an 
emergency decree to break up thousands of political gatherings, detain 
thousands of black activists for months and even years without charge and put 
hundreds on trial. 
</P>
<P>
By relaxing those clamps on anti-government protest, De Klerk has released but 
not cooled the sense of frustration in the townships, where the legacy of 42 
years of racial discrimination is readily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of blacks have marched to protest poor living conditions, high rents, 
unequal education and corrupt Pretoria-supported town councils. Several times 
in recent weeks, police have opened fire on those demonstrators, and more than 
two dozen activists, most of them in their teens, have died. 
</P>
<P>
ANC leaders deny any loss of faith among the younger generation of activists. 
But the nation's primary anti-apartheid movement has yet to complete the 
massive task of re-establishing itself inside South Africa. And disorganization 
at the top, with many leaders suddenly out of jail and exiles preparing to 
return, are making the job more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and the older generation are urging the youth to remain disciplined and 
refrain from undirected violence while at the same time trying to reassure 
whites of the ANC's commitment to peace. 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela's accommodating statements contrast sharply with the fiery rhetoric 
of the ANC's young radical leaders, who support the ANC decision to open lines 
of communication with the government but show little faith in negotiation 
politics and speak often of stepping up the war. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing to negotiate is the transference of power from the minority 
regime to the majority," Michael Dube, an 18-year-old leader of an 
ANC-affiliated students organization in Soweto, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"And the only way to do that is to shoot and talk," Dube added. 
</P>
<P>
ANC youth leaders say police killings of black protesters in recent weeks are 
undermining their attempts to win young people over to the idea of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want negotiations to be successful, you must get the people to support 
you," said Peter Mokaba, president of the ANC-aligned South African Youth 
Congress. "But how do you get people to support you when they see the people 
you want to talk to firing guns at them in the streets?" 
</P>
<P>
Mokaba recently told a cheering throng of supporters that now is the time "to 
wage peace in the communities and wage war on the enemy." Many youngsters in 
the crowd carried replicas of AK-47 rifles, carefully carved out of wood and 
branded with the name of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of 
the Nation). 
</P>
<P>
The rival PAC contends that support for the ANC is slowly draining away among 
young people. The PAC's student organization, formed six months ago and known 
as PASO, now claims 45,000 members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not opposed to negotiations in principle," said Lawrence Nquandela, 24, 
the secretary general of PASO. "But at this juncture we feel the enemy is very 
strong militarily, and we do not believe any capitalistic government will 
voluntarily negotiate itself out of power." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's reform initiatives "are just a ploy to get rid of international 
pressure," Nquandela added. "And you mustn't lie to the young people."

BRADLEY TO UNVEIL PLAN FOR RATIONING OF WATER; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: THE MAYOR IS LIKELY TO CALL FOR A MANDATORY 10% CUT FROM 1986 
CONSUMPTION LEVELS, AIDES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with what aides describe as a now-or-never decision, Mayor Tom Bradley 
will call today for mandatory water rationing to begin as soon as possible in 
Los Angeles, according to his senior advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley will announce details of the plan at a press conference scheduled for 
this morning, according to aides, who scrambled late into the day to pull the 
program together. 
</P>
<P>
The exact provisions of the rationing plan -- which must be approved by the 
City Council -- were not available late Tuesday. But based on proposals made 
earlier by the Department of Water and Power, it is likely that the mayor will 
call for a mandatory 10% cut from consumption levels in 1986, the aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said it is necessary to call for rationing now because waiting any longer 
may mean that the plan could not be implemented before the critical hot summer 
months. "It's either do it now, or wait until next year," said one of the 
mayor's top aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
City water officials earlier had said that it would take at least a month and 
possibly several months to put a rationing program in place. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who a month ago had called for a voluntary 10% cutback, told reporters 
Monday that "the public has not gotten the message" about the critical water 
shortage and that he was determined to "go forward with a water-rationing 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised emergency conservation law that Bradley is expected to 
propose, violators would suffer stiff financial penalties, but would not face 
having their water service disconnected unless they were chronic wasters of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's call for rationing would be one of the most drastic steps yet taken 
in Southern California in response to a projected 10% shortage in water 
supplies from the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
"This may well set the tone" for Southern California, said Carl Boronkay, 
general manager of the MWD. "I think the mayor is taking a leadership position. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we want to leave it up to the individual member agencies how they 
reach the end we all seek," Boronkay added. 
</P>
<P>
The MWD supplies 60% of all the water to Los Angeles and the six-county region 
running from Mexico to Ventura County, but its supplies have dwindled this 
year, the fourth consecutive year of drought conditions in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The MWD has called on the 300 communities it serves to have rationing laws on 
the books in case they need to be implemented, but so far the giant water 
agency has stopped short of asking any city to actually ration water. 
</P>
<P>
Just what kind of reception the mayor's plan will receive in the City Council 
is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude enthusiastically endorsed Bradley's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy the mayor has taken this initiative," Braude said. "I think it's 
apparent we take a mandatory position . . . and it's important for Los Angeles 
to be a leader." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said, "If we wait too long," to implement rationing, 
"we will have to take even more drastic action" than a 10% cutback. 
</P>
<P>
But council member Joan Milke Flores, who chairs the key Commerce, Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee that oversees water matters, said she believes that 
the mayor is reacting to media pressure in calling for rationing at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure if that is good or bad, but I believe he is reacting to the 
media" and not necessarily to the facts now before him, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where this (Bradley's rationing proposal) is coming from," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores noted that she got no indication from DWP staff that rationing was 
deemed necessary at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Some city water officials were also surprised to hear of the mayor's decision. 
Engineers at the DWP have yet to make any recommendation on whether rationing 
is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Caruso, president of the DWP's board of commissioners, said: "We'll wait 
and see what the mayor calls for and we'll respond to it. . . . If the mayor 
calls up, we'll review (the facts) and give our opinion. "I think the mayor's 
concern is that the city take a leadership role," Caruso said. "I think he 
wants us to be out front on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP's opinion on the adequacy of Los Angeles' water supply could be 
important to council passage of any rationing law. 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing law, the DWP would have to make a finding that rationing is 
necessary before the measure could be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley will be calling on the council to pass a new law -- with updated 
features and stiffer financial penalties -- that will probably do away with the 
provision that bases rationing on a finding of the DWP, aides to the mayor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear what prompted Bradley to act at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's own chief deputy said only last Friday that a decision on rationing 
would take several weeks while the mayor reviewed data on water supplies, 
consumption rates and effects of conservation. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a request from Bradley, the DWP commissioners last week prepared 
a list of suggested modifications to the city's existing water rationing law, 
but they stopped short of recommending that the program actually be implemented 
at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bradley said that his rationing decision would hinge on how well 
residents responded in April to his call to voluntarily cut water use by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP reported this week that total water consumption dropped by 14% in 
April, compared to usage in the same month last year. Jim Wickser, DWP 
assistant general manager, said it is unclear just how much of that cut was the 
result of conservation and how much was the result of cooler, wetter weather in 
the Los Angeles Basin this year, compared to April last year. 
</P>
<P>
But yesterday one senior aide to Bradley said, "The DWP has presented the mayor 
with plenty of information that would justify" rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Under the DWP's recommendations, Phase 1 of the water conservation law would be 
amended to include an immediate ban on landscape watering between 10 a.m. and 5 
p.m. and on excessive watering that leads to runoff onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP recommended that it be given the power to shut off the flow of water to 
repeat offenders. Now, only the City Council can order a violator's service 
shut off. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rationing proposal that Bradley will probably propose, residents 
would be limited to using 90% of the water they used in comparable months of 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
That year is being selected in an effort to be fair to those customers who have 
already responded to the the mayor's repeated calls for conservation during the 
last several years. 
</P>
<P>
On the first violation, DWP customers would face a surcharge of $3 per billing 
unit of excess use, plus 15% of the water bill. A billing unit is 748 gallons 
of water. 
</P>
<P>
A second violation would cost $3 per excess billing unit, plus 25% of the bill. 
And a third violation would boost the surcharge to $4 per excess billing unit 
and 75% of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"A 10% cut is doable without any significant lifestyle changes or economic 
dislocations," one aide to the mayor said. In fact, the DWP already has 
estimated that consumers have cut water use by 8% in the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
Under rationing guidelines recently drawn up by DWP, exemptions to water 
allotments could be granted if: 
</P>
<P>
Conservation would result in unemployment. 
</P>
<P>

U.S. TO PROPOSE NEW CUTS IN NUCLEAR ARMS IN EUROPE 
</P>

The Bush Administration, faced with growing anti-nuclear sentiment in Europe, 
is readying a proposal to open negotiations with the Soviet Union to eliminate 
all short-range, ground-launched nuclear weapons from Europe, Administration 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to launch negotiations "on an accelerated schedule" would cover 
the Lance missile and two classes of U.S. nuclear artillery, as well as the 
equivalent Soviet weapons, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative is expected to be the subject of an intense round of North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization consultations beginning later this week, when 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III meets with foreign ministers of the 
alliance in Brussels, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who met with West German Defense Minister 
Gerhard Stoltenberg at the Pentagon on Tuesday, is expected to discuss the new 
U.S. proposal with other defense ministers at a NATO Nuclear Planning Group 
meeting in Calgary, Canada, next week. 
</P>
<P>
Unless snags develop during the allied consultations, U.S. officials could have 
the plan ready to present at the May 30-June 3 summit in Washington between 
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed move would significantly expand the goals and speed up the 
schedule for negotiations restricting the short-range nuclear weapons, which 
have become something of an anachronism in Europe now that East and West 
Germany are progressing speedily toward unification. 
</P>
<P>
The draft proposal calls for elimination of the ground-based weapons, a goal 
that goes well beyond the "comprehensive concept" that NATO adopted last May. 
That alliance position stated that prospective negotiations on short-range 
nuclear forces should be aimed at the "partial reduction" of such weapons 
rather than a total ban. 
</P>
<P>
The short-range weapons were not covered under the 1988 Intermediate Nuclear 
Forces Treaty, which banned ground-launched missiles with a range of 300 to 
3,400 miles. The new category of missiles would have a range of less than 300 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's new position would schedule negotiations on short-range 
systems to begin as early as next fall, when NATO and the Warsaw Pact are 
expected to sign an agreement sharply reducing conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, last year's "comprehensive concept" called for negotiations to 
begin only after the opposing alliances begin to carry out the force reductions 
called for in the Conventional Forces in Europe agreements. By most estimates, 
that would delay the start of short-range nuclear forces negotiations until at 
least 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrust is that there has been a basic adjustment" in the U.S. position, 
said one knowledgeable Administration source. "The calculation has been that 
it's better to get out ahead of this debate than letting the Soviets propose 
the denuclearization of Germany" in the reunification talks set to begin 
Saturday in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
With the May summit already set to address long-range nuclear missiles and a 
conventional forces agreement, the latest Administration proposal would set out 
a process for addressing another major class of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting negotiations would seek to ban the Soviets' deployment in Eastern 
Europe of four types of short-range ballistic missiles -- the Scud, Frog, 
Scarab and Spider -- as well as three kinds of artillery pieces. 
</P>
<P>
However, the American proposal would allow each side to maintain and modernize 
its arsenal of aircraft-carried nuclear weapons, such as air-launched cruise 
missiles and the U.S. nuclear-tipped tactical air-to-surface missile. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of such weapons throughout Western Europe traditionally has 
stirred less controversy than the fielding of ground-based missiles. In 
addition, excluding the aircraft-borne weapons would leave NATO with a potent 
nuclear deterrent capable of reaching beyond Eastern Europe and into Soviet 
territory from bases in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials said that salvaging an air-launched missile force 
from rising anti-nuclear sentiment has been a principal U.S. aim in formulating 
the new proposal. By making concessions on the timing and goals of negotiations 
on short-range nuclear arms, Administration officials said they hope to defuse 
pressures for the removal of all U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"There is tremendous pressure on us to do something, especially from the 
(European) allies," said one U.S. official. "It is not an issue that can be 
iced until 1992." 
</P>
<P>
But to some European anti-nuclear activists, the proposal will merely shift the 
focus of controversy in Europe to air-launched weapons, which have slipped 
virtually unnoticed into and out of European air bases. 
</P>
<P>
"It amounts to turning in two handguns for an assault rifle and calling it arms 
control," said Dan Plesch, an arms control analyst with the British-American 
Security Information Council, a group active in promoting disarmament. The 
air-launched missiles "will do everything ground-based systems can do and a 
whole lot more." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had planned to spend $500 million over the next five years to 
build a new generation of Lance short-range nuclear missiles. But with European 
sentiment running high against the modernization program, Administration 
officials have acknowledged that the new weapons are unlikely to be built. 
</P>
<P>
Technical troubles and congressional opposition also have dogged the Pentagon's 
proposed production of new nuclear projectiles for 8-inch and 155-millimeter 
artillery weapons. More recently, the West German government has balked at 
deployment in West Germany of the projectiles, whose maximum range of 19 miles 
would ensure that any such weapon fired from West German soil would explode in 
East Germany or in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
New democratic governments in those two states and the prospect of German 
reunification make either option politically troublesome.

VETERINARIAN WINS ROUND IN BATTLE OVER CUB

A Superior Court judge Tuesday barred state wildlife officials from seizing an 
abandoned black bear cub from a Big Bear Lake veterinarian, ruling that the 
animal, named Coconino, should remain with her caretaker until a lawsuit over 
the matter can be heard next month. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Rufus Yent, in granting the injunction sought by veterinarian Kent 
Walker, said questions remain about whether Coconino -- an animal raised since 
birth by humans -- can be defined as a "wild" creature and thus subject to 
control by the California Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
Such questions, the judge said, "have never before been litigated in 
California" and must be resolved at trial, which he set for June 4. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled," Diana Carloni, an attorney representing Walker, said of the 
preliminary victory. "The judge basically bought our argument, and we certainly 
feel this is in the best interest of Coconino." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the state Department of Fish and Game, meanwhile, expressed 
disappointment but pledged to continue their fight to return Coconino to the 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still optimistic that the bear has a chance to grow up and live in the 
woods," said Paul Jensen, the department's deputy director. "But our experts 
tell us that the longer the cub remains in close proximity to humans, the more 
you reduce your odds of having a successful reintroduction (to the wild)." 
</P>
<P>
Yent's ruling marks the latest twist in an unusual tug-of-war between Walker 
and Fish and Game officials. The case essentially is a clash of opinions on the 
proper handling of wild animals adopted by humans at birth. 
</P>
<P>
The cub was found Jan. 30 by hikers in a snowy valley north of Big Bear Lake, a 
village in the San Bernardino Mountains. Apparently abandoned by its mother, 
the newborn weighed just seven ounces. 
</P>
<P>
The hikers turned the tiny bear over to Walker, who took it into his home and 
began feeding it a special milk formula from a baby bottle. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting several experts, Walker decided Coco had become too accustomed 
to humans to survive release into the wild. Instead, Walker began planning to 
raise Coco in a fenced enclosure, where, he reasoned, she could serve as an 
educational resource for children and visitors to the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The community responded enthusiastically. A Coconino Trust Fund was launched, 
and the sale of "Save Coconino" T-shirts, bumper stickers and buttons has 
pumped more than $7,000 into the account. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Department of Fish and Game -- which has legal authority over 
California's wildlife -- had a different reaction. The department contends that 
bears, as wild animals, should live in the wild, and wants to send Coco to a 
"rehabilitation" center to prepare her for a return to the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, however, is convinced the rehabilitation process would fail and that 
Coco -- regarding all humans as friends because of her happy experience as an 
infant -- would merely become an easy target for poachers. 
</P>
<P>
In his lawsuit, Walker contends that he may assert ownership over Coconino 
because she has become "tamed" through the three months she has spent in his 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game attorneys say a victory for Walker would set a dangerous 
precedent, allowing others to seize wild animals, hold on to them long enough 
to describe them as tame and claim ownership.

HEALTH CARE FOR THE AGED: 'INVEST NOW OR PAY LATER'; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: STUDY PREDICTS A THREEFOLD RISE IN COST OF CARING FOR THE ELDERLY. 
THE AUTHORS CALL FOR MORE PUBLIC FUNDING OF RESEARCH INTO TREATING DISEASES. 
</P>

<P>
The aging of America will escalate health-care costs in a way that no "cost 
containment" will be able to control, according to a new federal study that the 
researchers say supports the growing demand for more public funding for 
research into diseases of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The study's authors, from USC and the National Institute on Aging, predict a 
threefold increase in Medicare costs by the year 2040. To slow that rise, they 
called Tuesday for increased support for research into treating diseases like 
Alzheimer's and osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trillion-dollar issue," said Dr. Edward L. Schneider, dean of the Ethel 
Percy Andrus Gerontology Center at USC and one of the authors of the study. 
"You can invest now or pay later. The costs for medical care are going to go 
into the trillions." 
</P>
<P>
The study, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., comes 
amid growing demands from some health-policy experts and researchers for a 
shift in the balance of research funding toward conditions that afflict people 
aged 65 and over. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the study, U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said Tuesday that he intends to 
introduce a bill aimed at enabling older people to remain healthy and active 
longer. Among other things, the bill would double federal spending for aging 
research to $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
However, some skeptics question whether increased research spending can really 
help control health-care costs. Some suggest that attention is best focused on 
changing people's lifestyles to improve their quality of life and keep them 
active longer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this wonderful faith in scientific progress benefiting mankind," said 
Daniel Callahan, a prominent specialist in biomedical ethics. " . . . But 
scientific progress, I think, has demonstrated that it becomes very, very 
expensive in the health-care arena." 
</P>
<P>
"Managing old age better is not an issue best handled by waiting for the cure," 
wrote Dr. James F. Fries, an associate professor at Stanford University School 
of Medicine in an editorial accompanying the new study. 
</P>
<P>
"It requires healthy lifestyles . . . environmental improvements . . . and 
(mechanisms) to limit inappropriate and inhumane terminal care," Fries wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider and Dr. Jack M. Guralnik, an epidemiologist at the National Institute 
on Aging, used U.S. Census projections to estimate future costs for Medicare, 
nursing homes, dementia and hip fractures over the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings include: 
</P>
<P>
There could be 52 million to 57 million Americans over age 65 in the year 2020 
and as many as 83 million by the year 2050. There could be as many as 8.6 
million Americans over age 85 by 2020 and as many as 17.8 million by 2040. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare costs -- "a useful reflection of the overall costs for health care for 
older Americans" -- will nearly double by the year 2020. By 2040, when the 
average age of members of the Baby Boom will be 85, Medicare costs could reach 
$212 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing home costs could rise to as much as $139 billion by 2040, with as many 
as 6 million nursing home residents aged 65 and older. (By contrast, there were 
1.3 million nursing home residents in 1985, costing $31 billion.) 
</P>
<P>
As many as 9.8 million Americans could suffer from moderate to severe dementia 
by 2040, costing as much as $149 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The medical cost of hip fractures among the aged is expected to increase from 
$1.6 billion in 1985 to $6 billion in 2040. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider and Guralnik argue that one answer to skyrocketing costs is a 
significant investment in aging research -- specifically, the search for 
treatments or cures for diseases like Alzheimer's that leave people alive but 
disabled for many years. 
</P>
<P>
According to Schneider, federal funding for research into diseases related to 
aging now hovers around $500 million annually. He and others would like to see 
that figure at least doubled. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't address (this) now, we will wake up in 10 or 20 years . . . and 
regret the opportunity that we lost," Schneider said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
That view received support Tuesday from others in the field of aging, most of 
whom say their specialty has been relatively under-funded. Traditionally, heart 
disease and cancer have received a far greater share of federal research money. 
</P>
<P>
But others expressed reservations about Schneider and Guralnik's 
recommendations. Some, like Fries, suggested their projections were overly 
pessimistic. Others questioned whether research would really result in a 
slowdown in the rise of health-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that aging can be solved by magic bullets," said Carroll L. 
Estes, director of the Institute for Health and Aging at UC San Francisco. "I 
think a universal, publicly financed health-care program is what is necessary 
to contain costs." 
</P>
<P>
Callahan, director of the Hastings Center, a research organization devoted to 
ethical issues in medicine and biology, said research may be expected to 
improve the quality of life. But, he said, it will not necessarily hold down 
costs.

SENATE OKS $720 MILLION IN AID TO PANAMA, NICARAGUA; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: AN ABORTION PROPOSAL ATTACHED TO THE BILL RAISES THE PROSPECT OF A 
VETO BY BUSH.

<P>
The Senate, threading its way through a tangle of unrelated amendments, finally 
approved President Bush's request for emergency aid to Panama and Nicaragua on 
Tuesday. But the $720-million package still faces a threatened presidential 
veto over a controversial provision covering abortions in the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The aid package, which contained all but $80 million of the emergency 
assistance that Bush sought for Panama and Nicaragua, was passed by a voice 
vote as part of a $3.4-billion supplemental spending bill. It now must be 
reconciled with a House-approved measure that includes the same amounts but not 
the controversial abortion provision. 
</P>
<P>
While aid for the newly democratic governments of Panama and Nicaragua drove 
the bill along its bumpy ride through the Senate, floor fights over abortion 
and the death penalty and 11th-hour concerns about Lithuania dominated the 
weeklong debate. 
</P>
<P>
Propelled by Republicans, the Senate, on a 73-24 vote, added an amendment to 
the bill advising the White House against seeking Senate approval of a new 
trade agreement with the Soviet Union until Moscow has lifted its economic 
embargo of Lithuania and begun negotiations with the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania and another foreign policy controversy -- military aid to El Salvador 
-- also dominated a session in which Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
appeared before a Senate panel earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying to the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that handles foreign aid, 
Baker came under pressure from several lawmakers who argued that an agreement 
reached in Paris last week to give the Soviet Union "most favored nation" 
trading status was ill-timed in view of the Lithuanian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, defending Bush's "balanced" response as the best approach, said that the 
Administration is committed to helping Lithuania realize its independence but 
only in a manner that does not jeopardize the wide range of "very important 
interests" at stake in the U.S.-Soviet relationship. 
</P>
<P>
While congressional concern over Lithuania dominated the closing hours of the 
Senate's debate of the supplemental appropriations bill, it was the inclusion 
late Monday of the abortion provision that clouded its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The provision, allowing the district to use revenues from municipal taxes to 
fund Medicaid abortions for poor women, was identical to one that the President 
vetoed last year. White House officials have said that, as much as he wants the 
Nicaragua-Panama aid package, Bush will veto the bill if the provision is not 
deleted in the conference with the House. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, the aid package will be kicked back to the Senate. If the veto 
is sustained there, the process will begin all over again, resulting in a 
succession of delays that would make it difficult to predict when emergency aid 
will reach Panama and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Baker appealed to the senators to pass the legislation quickly and not "play 
politics with the future of freedom and democracy in Central America." 
</P>
<P>
However, it was U.S. aid for another Central American ally, El Salvador, that 
Baker defended during most of his time on the Hill on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a House Democratic task force released a report concluding that an 
investigation into the murder of six Jesuit priests in San Salvador last year 
has been brought to a "virtual standstill" because of stonewalling by 
Salvadoran military officials. 
</P>
<P>
The report, whose conclusions the State Department has reluctantly endorsed, is 
expected to greatly strengthen the hands of Democrats in both the House and 
Senate who are proposing to cut military aid to El Salvador by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Baker conceded that future levels of U.S. aid to El Salvador will depend in 
part on how the Salvadorans handle the investigation, which could end up 
implicating senior military officers.

10,500 SOVIET JEWS ARRIVED IN APRIL, ISRAEL OFFICIAL SAYS

About 10,500 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel in April, the largest monthly figure 
since the start of a mass Soviet immigration to the Jewish state last year, an 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Israel had published a figure for Soviet arrivals since 
early March, when such statistics were censored in response to Arab guerrilla 
threats to attack immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Gad Ben Ari, the spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which is 
partly responsible for resettling the immigrants, gave the figure for April. He 
added that Israel's goal is "to bring the maximum amount of people in the 
minimum amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
Before April, the monthly immigration figure for Soviet Jews was between 4,000 
and 6,000, Israeli and foreign reports said. In 1989, 12,000 Soviet Jews 
settled in Israel, and in 1988 only 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The relaxation in the censorship of immigration statistics appears to be a 
result of pressure from overseas fund-raisers, particularly those in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials estimate that up to 300,000 Soviet Jews will emigrate to 
Israel in the next few years. The influx comes because of a loosening of 
immigration procedures in the Soviet Union and tighter U.S. restrictions.

President Bush will meet with Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene on 
Thursday to get a firsthand report on conditions in the rebel Baltic republic, 
but the White House said Tuesday that the talks do not mean a change in U.S. 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The President feels that it's important to get an authoritative readout and 
description of events in Lithuania. . . . He is meeting with her as an 
acknowledged and freely elected representative of the Lithuanian people," 
rather than as "prime minister of an independent Lithuania," spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States has never accepted the Soviet Union's forcible 
annexation of Lithuania in 1940, Bush has refused to recognize the breakaway 
government, which declared independence March 11. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said that he does not want to undermine Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev and possibly set back the rise of democracy in Eastern Europe.

DARMAN URGES OPTIMISM ON U.S. FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In one of his rare public speeches, Richard G. Darman, director of the White 
House Office of Management and Budget, Tuesday attacked the 
"America-is-in-decline" mood that he said he worries has captured the popular 
imagination in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"As history seems to be moving America's way, America is less than fully 
conscious of its own continuing primacy," Darman said in a speech delivered at 
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. "U.S. opinion leaders seem 
less than fully confident of America's vital destiny, its unique capacity to 
move the world toward new frontiers in the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
The speech marks an ironic turnabout for Darman, who himself attracted 
widespread attention in the past for his attacks on the self-indulgence of 
American society in the 1980s and implied criticism of certain policies of the 
Ronald Reagan Administration that he helped to carry out. A text of the speech 
was made available by Darman's office here. 
</P>
<P>
This time, while repeating some of his familiar themes, Darman's emphasis was 
much more upbeat, encouraging Americans to be more optimistic about their 
future by overcoming what he called the nation's "fear of flying." 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically indulging his own taste for mixing metaphors from pop 
culture with historical imagery, Darman challenged those he claimed are 
threatening to undermine the American romantic spirit, with its love of 
freedom, distrust of authority and pioneering taste for heroics. 
</P>
<P>
To Darman, one enemy of the American romantic spirit is the "alluring romantic 
image" of the "simple, bucolic, blue-green planet, untainted by competitive 
industrial advance, unmarked by 'artificial' boundaries of competing 
nation-states." The image, he argued, holds a strong appeal to many 
environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
Darman has emerged as one of the Bush Administration's strongest internal 
skeptics of environmental activism and a harsh critic of Environmental 
Protection Agency head William K. Reilly. While saying that "in the main, 
environmentalism is benign and well-intended," and half-jokingly acknowledging 
that "my wife and children are environmentalists. The President is an 
environmentalist," Darman also argued that it is "a green mask under which 
different faces of politico-economic ideology can hide." 
</P>
<P>
He argued that some environmentalists see the movement as a way to promote an 
anti-growth global management regime that is at odds with the free market, 
progress-oriented approach so popular in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans did not fight and win the wars of the 20th Century to make the world 
safe for green vegetables," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a relatively brief discussion of the challenges facing him directly as 
President Bush's budget director, Darman set out his goals for budget 
negotiations with congressional leaders -- talks widely expected to begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
He ticked off several goals, including a reform of the budget process, a 
slowdown in the growth of benefit programs like Medicare, Social Security and 
farm subsidies, an effort to cap the government's hidden liabilities and reform 
of federal accounting controls. 
</P>
<P>
Darman also repeated recent statements that the Bush Administration might go 
along with certain increases in revenues, but stated more clearly that he means 
by that a cut in the capital gains tax and higher user fees rather than any 
rise in income taxes.

FDA APPROVES IRRADIATION TO KILL BACTERIA IN POULTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government Tuesday approved irradiation, a controversial food 
processing technique, for use on poultry as a way of controlling bacterial 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that poultry producers now 
can employ gamma rays, X-rays or electron radiation as weapons against 
salmonella and other bacteria. Federal officials believe that as much as 36.9% 
of the nation's processed chicken harbors the harmful salmonella bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the announcement was divided. Some industry groups welcomed the 
development, although a few were lukewarm. Elsewhere, a consumer group 
condemned the FDA's action. 
</P>
<P>
Irradiation was first approved by the agency in 1963 for use on flour. Later 
its use was extended to several other types of food for problems as diverse as 
infestation, spoilage or parasites. At present, however, spices are the only 
foods irradiated with any regularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Irradiation is totally safe," said Bill Grigg, an FDA spokesman, who said 
Tuesday's authorization is the first major use of irradiation to control a 
human bacterial disease. "There is no way that the food can become radioactive 
and at these levels (approved for use on chicken) there is not even any great 
change in flavor." 
</P>
<P>
The maximum dose allowed to process poultry will be 300,000 rads. (A rad is a 
dosage of absorbed radiation.) Food treated with irradiation is exposed for 
short times, depending on the processor's objective. 
</P>
<P>
"Adequate scientific studies have not been conducted on food irradiation," said 
Michael Colby, director of Food &amp; Water Inc., a New York-based advocacy 
group. "For instance, there are small toxic properties -- unique radiolytic 
products -- remaining in irradiated food after processing. The FDA is asking 
American consumers to accept these small toxins in an attempt to control the 
salmonella problem. Well, consumers want real solutions to the salmonella 
problem and they don't want another toxic technology." 
</P>
<P>
A representative of Radiation Sterilizers Inc. of Tustin, which operates one of 
Southern California's few irradiation plants, said he is delighted with the 
FDA's approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm enthusiastic not because it may mean new business but because the approval 
shows another place where irradiation can fit (in food processing)," said Wally 
Hall, the firm's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
One meat industry trade group supports the FDA's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, I'm in favor of irradiation," said Rosemary Mucklow, executive 
director for the Western States Meat Assn. in Oakland. "Irradiation is a 
technology that has been very misrepresented by consumer groups. It is a 
technology that should be judged only on the science. And as long as the FDA 
has used good scientific support and investigation in order to find it safe, 
then I'm very encouraged."

REP. PANETTA CRITICIZES EMERGENCY AGENCY AS SLOW TO ACT IN QUAKE

Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) Tuesday criticized the performance of 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Loma Prieta earthquake last 
fall, citing excessive bureaucracy that resulted in a "circle of frustration" 
for victims. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses before a House subcommittee echoed his views, including those 
making similar complaints about FEMA's performance during Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
"In many instances I felt that I had to exert great pressure on these officials 
to have them provide services that should have been provided without my 
intervention," Panetta told a House Public Works and Transportation 
subcommittee that is investigating FEMA's ability to cope with major disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"In my district, it took weeks and months before some of the needed assistance 
reached the victims," he said. 
</P>
<P>
FEMA officials said that the agency's top official for disaster response, Grant 
Peterson, is scheduled to testify before the subcommittee today. He would not 
discuss the criticism of the agency before his appearance, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta said that FEMA's earthquake assistance efforts were marred by poor 
coordination and unnecessary complexity. As a result, he said, people were 
shuffled from agency to agency and victims waited longer to receive assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my constituents asked me why Ft. Ord, located in Monterey, could not 
provide some of the tents, blankets, generators and other necessary and vital 
supplies that were desperately needed," Panetta said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
PRESS HIT FOR SEEKING ATTORNEY DONATIONS

<P>
Bill Press, one of the apparent front-runners in the race for the Democratic 
nomination for insurance commissioner, came under attack Tuesday for soliciting 
thousands of dollars of campaign contributions from attorneys who advertise 
heavily for clients with accident claims against insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Bourhis, another Democrat in the race and an attorney himself, raised 
questions about a fund-raising reception Press will hold next Tuesday at the 
San Francisco home of Arnold Laub, one of the biggest advertisers of litigation 
services. The invitation lists 65 trial lawyers, some of them important 
advertisers in lucrative auto accident litigation, as supporting Press. 
</P>
<P>
Bourhis also said he has been told that the Los Angeles telephone solicitation 
firm of Gordon &amp; Schwenkmeyer, which he said has traditionally been a big 
fund raiser for the California Trial Lawyers Assn., has in recent days assisted 
trial lawyers active in the auto accident litigation business in raising 
$100,000 for Press. 
</P>
<P>
Bourhis said that such big advertising attorneys as Laub, Larry H. Parker of 
Long Beach and Michael Scranton of Pleasant Hill are "famous for profiting from 
this business" and have "vested interests in the state Insurance Department." 
It is not right for Press, he said, to take contributions from them or use them 
to raise money for him if he hopes to be an independent commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Press' campaign manager, Michael J. Ganley, said, "It's sheer hypocrisy for 
Bourhis to accuse Press of taking money from people he's begging from himself." 
He suggested that Bourhis "is just upset he's raised so little support from his 
peers." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we're raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from all of our donors," 
Ganley added. "We're up against a millionaire politician (Democratic state Sen. 
John Garamendi) who's received a half-a-million-dollar bank loan, and we're 
receiving donations from our friends." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Scranton said he was surprised by Bourhis' statements because he had 
also given Bourhis a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am a lawyer, and yes, I advertise, and yes, I contribute to Bill 
Press," Scranton said. "I think these accusations are insane and sour grapes 
for Ray Bourhis." 
</P>
<P>
Bourhis, however, insisted that he is not seeking to raise money from the big 
advertising attorneys and said he will return Scranton's $1,000 contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to distinguish between people who are part of the problem and people who 
are part of the solution," Bourhis said. "Those attorneys pursuing product 
liability cases, consumer complaints against unfair insurer practices, 
representing women and minorities, these are attorneys trying to do a good job 
representing people. 
</P>
<P>
"But to the advertisers, it's a business, and some of these firms are nothing 
more than accident claims mills, closely associated with teams of doctors and 
chiropractors." 
</P>
<P>
Laub, host of next week's fund-raising reception for Press, joined Scranton in 
accusing Bourhis of "sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
"If he says personal injury attorneys should not get involved in the 
commissioner's race, then why is he running?" he asked of Bourhis. "He should 
withdraw himself. We obviously have a right to be involved in behalf of a 
candidate we like." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, credited in a recent Press contribution report with raising money for 
him, was not available for comment. Mike Gordon, president of the Gordon &amp; 
Schwenkmeyer firm, declined to comment on the firm's role.

KIDNAP FIGURE TO TESTIFY IN CAMARENA CASE, U.S. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal prosecutor said Tuesday that a longtime Drug Enforcement 
Administration operative who orchestrated the kidnaping of a Mexican doctor "is 
under government control" and will be made available to testify at the 
impending trial of four men who have been linked to the murder of U.S. drug 
agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure about DEA operative Antonio Garate Bustamante came from 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano during a pretrial hearing in the Camarena 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
Garate, who lives in Los Angeles in a fortified apartment, told The Times last 
week that he plotted the doctor's kidnaping after receiving approval from 
Hector Berrellez, a DEA agent who heads a nine-member team searching for 
Camarena's killers. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Garate said he used 10 Mexicans -- including some law 
enforcement officers -- to kidnap Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain from his 
Guadalajara office April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Garate said he has been working for the DEA on the Camarena case for several 
years and is paid $4,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Although Alvarez is not one of the defendants in the forthcoming trial, he has 
been indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles. Alvarez, a gynecologist, 
is accused of providing drugs to revive Camarena so that he could be 
interrogated and tortured further by drug traffickers and some ranking Mexican 
law enforcement officials at a Guadalajara house. Camarena's mutilated body was 
found in March, 1985, at a ranch 65 miles from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was flown to El Paso, Tex., where he was arrested by DEA agents from 
Los Angeles on April 3. His abduction drew condemnations from Mexican 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico charged in a Los 
Angeles speech that the kidnaping violated his country's national sovereignty. 
Mexico's attorney general on Friday announced that six Mexicans had been 
arrested for participating in the doctor's kidnaping and added that arrest 
warrants would be issued for seven other people, including Garate. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who is presiding over the Camarena case, 
said the manner in which Alvarez was brought to the United States was "of 
considerable concern" to him and he has scheduled a May 25 hearing to determine 
if anything illegal was done. He severed Alvarez from the trial of the four 
other men. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Medrano made his statement about Garate after defense lawyers said 
Tuesday that they wanted to talk to certain witnesses before the trial begins. 
</P>
<P>
Garate's name appears on a list of 11 people that prosecutors have given to 
defense attorneys. The individuals are believed to have information about the 
Camarena case, but prosecutors do not plan to put them on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Edward Medvene said that he wanted access to some of those 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie told the prosecutor that the defendants "cannot be denied access to 
confidential informants." The judge ordered prosecutors to set up telephone 
contacts between the 11 people on the list and the defense lawyers, who will 
ask them if they are willing to talk. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rafeedie warned the defense lawyers not to expect much from the phone 
conversations. "I'm almost certain all of these witnesses are going to decline 
to be interviewed," he said. "That has been the situation in the past." The 
witnesses could be subpoenaed to testify, however. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano said the government did not have access to all the individuals on the 
list. But when Medvene asked him about Garate, the prosecutor responded: "The 
government has access to him. He's under government control and he will be 
available." 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney said he would like to question Garate because the DEA 
operative had allegedly found a confidential informant who will testify against 
his client, Ruben Zuno Arce. Zuno, who has proclaimed his innocence, is a 
prominent Mexican businessman accused of being one of the plotters of the 
Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Garate, according to government documents, also has information about the 
activities of convicted drug kingpin Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, another 
defendant in the case.

A gunman went on a wild shooting rampage early Tuesday, ambushing and killing a 
bicycle rider, wounding two police officers in a sidewalk gun battle and 
critically wounding a man driving on the freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as Paul Bellazain, 46, of Daly City, fled on foot after 
he was wounded in the thigh during a shoot-out with officers near the crowded 
Westlake Mall in Daly City, just south of San Francisco, said Daly City Police 
Detective Jim McHenry. 
</P>
<P>
An officer, who was shot in the left arm during the struggle, tackled 
Bellazain, ending a 45-minute rampage during which the gunman cruised 
Interstate 280 in a brown Cadillac, firing at cars and later took a 
chiropractor and his receptionist hostage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had three guns when he came in and he said he was sorry he didn't have an 
Uzi," the shaken chiropractor, Gene Martin, said later. "I thought I was going 
to die, but he was really after the cops." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting apparently began shortly before 9 a.m. in San Francisco, and 
within 15 minutes, police received a call that the unidentified bike rider had 
been shot to death at John McLaren Park, on the border with Daly City. 
</P>
<P>
Bellazain, a San Francisco Municipal Railway driver and former president of a 
Transport Workers Union local, was in fair condition at a South San Francisco 
hospital, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
One victim, James Newman, 41, was in serious condition at San Francisco General 
Hospital with a bullet lodged in the right side of his chest, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Daly City police officers who were not identified were hospitalized with 
gunshot wounds to the arm. One was in excellent condition, and the other was in 
stable condition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellazain's daughter, Shari, had lost a kidney after being wounded in a 
drive-by shooting outside a San Mateo roller rink two years ago, Bellazain's 
co-workers at the municipal railway said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Bellazain's daughters, worried about their father's behavior, sought 
counseling at Seton Medical Center on Tuesday morning, said Deborah Stebbins, a 
hospital vice president. The daughters feared "he was potentially behaving in a 
way that he might be of harm to himself," Stebbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellazain will be booked for investigation of two counts of attempted murder in 
connection with the shootings of the police officers, Daly City police said. 
And he is under investigation in connection with the slaying and shootings in 
San Francisco, police there said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: CHICKEN SAYS HE'S RUFFLING NO ONE'S FEATHERS NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So what ever happened to Orned (Chicken) Gabriel? 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, Gabriel told The Times that he had been beaten by a "Rambo 
squad" of sheriff's deputies at the El Cajon jail. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-talking martial-arts expert had been jailed for non-payment of child 
support. His allegations of abuse emboldened other inmates to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury investigated. Sheriff John Duffy, after initially branding 
Gabriel and others as liars, punished several deputies and vowed that brutality 
would never again occur. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's once rock-solid popularity was hurt by his blustery behavior and 
out-of-touch management style. Later, he decided to take his 100% pension and 
not seek a sixth term. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gabriel has started to reshape his life. 
</P>
<P>
He just opened a martial arts studio, the United Karate Federation, in National 
City. He's born-again. Also married-again. 
</P>
<P>
He has reconciled with his teen-age son. He's teaching Bible classes at Bethel 
Baptist Church. And preaching a new, upbeat attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt better in my life: mentally, physically and spiritually," said 
Gabriel, 39. "My only battle is with Satan. I pray for those deputies and I 
forgive them completely." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not completely completely. His $2-million legal claim against the county 
is pending, with a court date set for May 30. 
</P>
<P>
He vows to stay out of trouble. In the past he's done jail stretches for 
forgery, assault and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Among those patronizing his studio are longtime friend Sagon Penn and at least 
two law enforcement officers. One, a sheriff's deputy, asks that his name not 
be used. 
</P>
<P>
The other, San Diego police detective Tyrone Crosby, says he's known Chicken -- 
so named because of his head movements during karate bouts -- since they were 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Chicken has turned his life around," Crosby said. "He's taken a lot in 
his life, but he's got a lot to offer to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's going to make it this time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homes on the Range? 
</P>
<P>
Try one of these. 
</P>
<P>
* Look for a head-on collision today when the Board of Supervisors discusses 
requiring property owners to grant easements for horse trails in the 
backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
Horse lovers will be there. 
</P>
<P>
So will the opponents: the Farm Bureau, Cattlemen's Assn., STOPP (Stop Taking 
Our Private Property), and WHOA (Worried Homeowners Organized &amp; Angry). 
</P>
<P>
* North County bumper sticker: God Is Awesome. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was on a mini-truck, and yes, the mini-truck was carrying a surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
* Fully-loaded Flipper? 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Herald reported Tuesday that the Navy is training killer dolphins in 
San Diego, Florida and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
A former civilian trainer says the dolphins are being taught to carry 
.45-caliber guns on their snouts to kill enemy frogmen. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman says the marine mammal program is top secret. But he adds that 
the dolphins are not in any danger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cruise Control 
</P>
<P>
An early brochure for congressional candidate Randall (Duke) Cunningham showed 
the retired Navy fighter pilot with actor Tom Cruise during the filming of "Top 
Gun" at Miramar Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing dresses up campaign literature like a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
But in a recent reprinting, the buddy-buddy picture is gone, replaced by a shot 
of Cunningham's family. 
</P>
<P>
Explanation: Cruise's agent informed Cunningham that Cruise does not endorse 
political candidates and does not want candidates using pictures that might 
imply otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise was sent the brochure by Jim Lantry, one of Cunningham's rivals for the 
Republican nomination in the 44th District. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Lantry informed Cruise that Cunningham is anti-abortion. 
Cruise favors keeping abortion legal.

CITY PROMISES TO CUT BUDGET IF TAX FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Unless Oxnard voters approve a 5% utility tax increase, the city must make some 
drastic budget cuts to avoid a $2.7-million deficit next year, City Manager 
David Mora told the City Council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mora issued the warning during the first of several discussions on the 1990-91 
budget, which is scheduled for final adoption at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of that utility tax is crucial to the survival of the city," Mora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, which voters will consider on June 5, would add about $5 million 
annually to Oxnard's coffers. However, Mora said, the city is going to proceed 
with the budget adoption process under the assumption that the tax will not be 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Without the extra revenue from the tax, the council must consider major budget 
cuts, which could include eliminating jobs and closing several city facilities 
such as a youth boxing center, a day camp, an art museum and a library. 
</P>
<P>
Mora and the city department heads drafted a list of budget cut options, which 
total $3,649,539 in reductions and include the elimination of 80 full-time 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, two citizens urged the council to spare La Colonia Youth 
Boxing Center from the budget chopping block. The center, which annually costs 
the city $43,450 to operate, serves about 400 youths, mostly from Latino 
working-class families, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard resident John Hart said he and other supporters of the center have 
collected signatures from more than 500 residents, urging the council to keep 
the center open. HUGO MARTIN

SCIENCE ROOM DESIGN HEADS FOR BULGARIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
High-tech classrooms meant to make studying science more fun will be built in 
Bulgaria under an agreement approved by the Hueneme School District. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which straddles the cities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard, has 
designed and built two of the high-tech classrooms at Blackstock and O. E. 
Green junior high schools in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Used by the district's 1,720 junior high students, the classrooms contain 
equipment such as satellite dishes for watching educational television programs 
from around the world, built-in computers for researching science subjects and 
robotic arms for demonstrating tasks such as assembling electronic equipment. 
They were built with about $200,000 in state funds, including lottery money. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which is trying to patent the classroom design, has agreed to let 
the Bulgarian Academy of Science of Sofia, which is a junior high school, 
market and distribute the high-tech classroom in Bulgaria. The district has an 
exchange program with the Bulgarian academy that began in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We first want to help them get an edge on education, and it's a way to bring 
hard currency into the district," said Don Cody, an administrator for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bulgarian school makes money from selling the design, then the Hueneme 
district would share in the profits, Cody said. Details of sharing the profits 
will be worked out later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Ronald Rescigno added that the district is trying to set up a similar 
arrangement with other governments. SCOTT LAWRENCE

COUNCIL SEEKS TO MOVE UP TAX VOTE

<P>
Fillmore city officials said Tuesday that they want to move up the date of a 
special election to raise new property taxes that would finance a proposed 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Fillmore City Council decided to propose the new taxing 
authority to Fillmore landowners in a special mail-in ballot July 26. 
</P>
<P>
But if 13 voting landowners agree, their votes could be cast in an earlier 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to make a decision and get the vote over with," said Councilman 
Roger Campbell. He said it was likely that the votes would be cast before July. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's proposed special tax district, Fillmore would levy new 
property taxes to pay off $5 million in bonds that are financing the 
development of an industrial park. Each landowner in the 128-acre area would be 
assessed new taxes to pay for sewer pipes, water lines and storm drains needed 
to develop the park. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore officials want the industrial park to lure business to the small town, 
which relies nearly exclusively on the agricultural industry for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
To approve the special tax authority, two-thirds of the landowners would have 
to approve the tax district. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMENT SOUGHT ON PLANNED RESTAURANT

<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial proposal to build a spaghetti house at the top of Arnaz Grade 
on California 33 in Oak View faces public scrutiny today from Ojai Valley 
residents concerned about increased traffic and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The county Environmental Report Review Committee will hold a public hearing on 
the proposed family-style restaurant with an entrance on a high-accident 
section of California 33. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing begins at 1:30 p.m. in Room 344 of the county government's Hall of 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The committee postponed the hearing last week after finding that a draft 
environmental study failed to cite new restrictions on air pollution for new 
development in Ojai Valley. The valley has the most restrictive air-quality 
standards for new construction in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Vince's Spaghetti House Inc. proposal is the first development to run up 
against the tightened air-quality regulations that took effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But LeRoy Andrews, architect of the proposed spaghetti house, said his client 
John Cuccia and family, owners of the restaurant chain, should not have to meet 
the stricter standards because they filed their application last June before 
the new rules took effect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally unfair," Andrews said Tuesday. He called the new hurdle "the 
standard bureaucratic mess." THIA BELL

OFFICIAL SAYS U.S. MAY NOT FUND VALLEY SUBWAY LINK 
</P>

<P>
The second-ranking official in the U.S. Department of Transportation told a San 
Fernando Valley business group Tuesday that she was pessimistic about prospects 
for federal funding of the third leg of Metro Rail that would bring the subway 
system to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not real optimistic about whether you're going to get it because the 
requirements are so extensive," Deputy Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao 
told a delegation from the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the budgetary constraints at this point, that's a massive undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
Chao, a one-time California investment banker, also pointedly mentioned cost 
overruns on the first phase of Metro Rail construction and cited Valley 
community opposition to the third leg, which would extend the northern terminus 
from Hollywood to North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear there seems to be a great deal of disagreement about where it should 
go, and whether some of the user groups support it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that although elected officials generally support the subway, the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors is split on the issue. Supervisors Mike 
Antonovich and Pete Schabarum are opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Chao's comments did not pertain to the second, 6.7-mile phase of construction 
extending from Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street west to Western Avenue 
and Wilshire and north to Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood. The 
Bush Administration recently signed a full-funding agreement to commit $667 
million in federal funds to this portion. 
</P>
<P>
Congress, which allocated money to the first two phases even when former 
President Ronald Reagan did not include any Metro Rail money in his proposed 
budgets, appears equally supportive. 
</P>
<P>
VICA, which represents 250 Valley firms, has taken a leading role in efforts to 
extend the subway to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the VICA government relations committee, who are in Washington 
meeting with congressional representatives, Administration officials and 
lobbyists, took Chao's remarks in stride. They vowed to continue pushing for 
federal Metro Rail funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Very frankly, she couldn't promise anything at this stage of the game," said 
VICA Chairman David W. Fleming, a Van Nuys attorney. "There's too much up in 
the air." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Fleming mentioned Propositions 108, 111 and 116 on the June 5 
ballot, which would increase the state gasoline tax by 9 cents per gallon and 
allow the sale of billions of dollars in rail construction bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which earlier had 
authorized building the subway from downtown to North Hollywood, voted to 
extend Metro Rail west from its North Hollywood terminus to the San Diego 
Freeway along a railroad freight right of way.

After committing two throwing errors, including one that allowed Savanna to go 
ahead by two runs, Valencia catcher Danette Davis didn't just get mad. She 
didn't just get even. 
</P>
<P>
Davis hit a two-run double in the fifth inning to give host Valencia a 3-2 
victory Tuesday. It was the first Orange League loss for Savanna (16-7, 6-1), 
and it pulled Valencia (15-7, 5-2) within one game of first-place Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually if I get errors or we're just not doing the job, inside I can feel 
myself getting angry," Davis said. "But not to the point where I'm going to 
mess up. Just to the point where I know I'm going to hit it. (Getting mad) 
helps my hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia fell behind, 2-0, in the top of the third after Savanna pitcher Leigh 
Sager tripled to score Irene Zuniga, who had walked. Sager then scored when 
Davis threw wildly on a pickoff attempt at third base. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia loaded the bases with two hits and a walk in the bottom of the inning, 
but the next three batters flied out. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we would let down a bit after that, but the same three kids who were 
on are the ones who scored," Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
The trio scored in the bottom of the fifth. The first two batters, Olivia 
Garcia and Sylvia Batiz, walked. Seig Lo, Valencia's leadoff hitter, bunted. 
But second baseman Danielle Zaleski, who was covering first base, bobbled the 
throw. Garcia went to third on the throw to first and scored easily after the 
bobble at first base. Valencia trailed, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs later, Davis' double scored Batiz and Lo with the eventual winning 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna tried to come back in the top of the sixth but Valencia center fielder 
Lo made two outstanding defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
She came from deep center to make a shoestring catch of a fly that dropped at 
the edge of the infield and, on the next ball, she sprinted to shallow 
left-center to catch another fly that looked like it would drop in for a 
single. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an athlete," Valencia Coach Debbie Fassel said of Lo. "She's the one kid 
on this team who, if you have to rely on somebody, we know she is going to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Like Davis, Lo may have been seeking a little redemption. Sager's run-scoring 
triple sailed over Davis' head in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's Natasha Dumoski (15-7) picked up the victory with a two-hitter, 
striking out 10 and walking three. Sager (7-5) picked up her first loss in four 
league starts. She threw a three-hitter, striking out three and walking four. 
</P>
<P>
"She (Sager) just couldn't find it today," Savanna Coach John Cortez said. 
</P>
<P>
In another Orange League game: 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda 5, Anaheim 0 -- Michelle Munro pitched a three-hitter in the 
victory. Munro (5-6) struck out seven and walked four. Angie Haynes had three 
hits for the Wildcats (10-9, 3-4).

<P>
The Orange Empire Conference baseball title was supposed to be decided 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
First-place Rancho Santiago and second-place Golden West will still meet, but 
the teams will be playing with nothing on the line. 
</P>
<P>
The title race ended Tuesday afternoon with Rancho Santiago winning it without 
taking the field. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West was defeated by Orange Coast, 12-7, Tuesday at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (31-8, 17-5 in conference), which had a bye, has a 2 1/2-game 
lead with two games left, thus winning its second conference title in three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very nice that we were able to win it with as young a club as we 
have," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. "It was our pitching that really 
did it. We led the conference in ERA (3.38) with a staff that was very 
inexperienced at the start of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Although OCC eliminated Golden West from a chance at first, Golden West had 
already clinched second place and a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
The top three teams from the conference will advance to the playoffs, which 
start May 12. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for OCC is that the Pirates avoided being swept in the four 
conference games with local rival Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates had 16 hits, including three each by Joe Pence, Steve Hernandez and 
Sid Maldonado. 
</P>
<P>
OCC built an 8-2 lead after three innings, but Golden West rallied to cut the 
lead to 8-5 in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
OCC (16-19, 9-13) scored four runs in the eighth for a 12-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Hutchins was hit by a pitch to start the one-out rally. Pence tripled and 
scored on a single by Hernandez. Rod McCall tripled to drive in Hernandez, and 
Maldonado's single scored McCall. 
</P>
<P>
John Douris (4-4) pitched the first 7 1/3 innings, allowing seven runs, five 
earned, for the victory. David Turner (4-3) started for Golden West but allowed 
eight hits and seven runs, five earned, in 2 1/3 innings to take the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Robb Carabba had three hits and Mike Willey and Frank Herman had two hits each 
for Golden West (25-11-1, 15-8). 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 5, Riverside 4 -- Saddleback (13-20, 6-16) had five consecutive hits 
and a sacrifice fly in the sixth inning to score four runs and take a 5-4 lead 
at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Ferguson started the winning rally with a single. Jason Thompson and Ted 
Savage singled to load the bases. Tony Wren had a two-run double to cut the 
lead to 4-3 and Neil Carter singled to tie it, 4-4. Brian Hoilman's sacrifice 
fly scored Wren with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Giuliano (7-5) got the victory, pitching the first 5 1/3 innings. Pat 
Norville worked the final three innings for the save. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Blomdahl (9-5) pitched nine innings, but took the loss for Riverside 
(26-15, 11-12). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 5, Cypress 3 (11 innings) -- Visiting Fullerton (22-13, 12-10) moved 
within a victory of clinching third place. The teams were tied, 2-2, at the end 
of nine innings and each scored in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11th, Fullerton's Dave Weckerle doubled and scored on a single by Benny 
Rodriguez. Rodriguez moved to second on a sacrifice by Willy Speakman and 
scored on single by Tom Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Burchit retired Cypress in the 11th for his second save. Tom Kelly (7-3) 
pitched 10 innings for the victory, and Ken Kendrena (4-1) pitched 10-plus 
innings to take the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had scored in the 10th on an error by Cypress third baseman Doug 
McConathy. Cypress (22-18, 8-14) tied it in the 10th on a single by Mark Pak 
and a two-out triple by Terry Tewell.

John Lorge has been appointed the San Diego Symphony's principal horn, 
orchestra officials announced Tuesday. Lorge, who has been the symphony's 
acting principal horn for the past three seasons, and two other musicians were 
named to permanent chairs in the horn section after auditions Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Before Lorge joined the local symphony in 1978, he was the Wisconsin Chamber 
Orchestra's principal horn in his native state. Lorge performs with the Arioso 
Wind Quintet and is a member of San Diego State University's music 
instructional studio faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Ford of Silver Spring, Md., will be the new assistant principal horn, and 
San Diego Symphony player Ethan Dulsky will be third horn. Ford has been 
co-principal horn with the Florida West Coast Symphony and has played with the 
Fairfax (Va.) Symphony. Dulsky came to San Diego in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In another move, American violinist Mark Kaplan will replace Briton Nigel 
Kennedy in Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto on Thursday and Friday at Copley 
Symphony Hall. Earlier this week, Kennedy canceled due to food poisoning. Music 
director designate Yoav Talmi will conduct the symphony both evenings in a 
program that also features Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan has appeared with numerous American orchestras and made his European 
debut as a last-minute substitute for Pinchas Zukerman in Cologne. In 1985, he 
premiered Marc Neikrug's Violin Concerto with the Halle Orchestra in 
Manchester, England, and later played it with the Berlin Radio Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
In the chamber music arena, he performs with pianist David Golub and cellist 
Colin Carr, a trio that has recorded all of the Schubert and Mendelssohn Piano 
Trios.

'FENCES' IS STAR QUALITY, STAR OR NOT; 
</P>
<P>
DRAMA: THE SAN DIEGO PREMIERE OF AUGUST WILSON'S PULITZER PRIZE-WINNER DOES 
JUSTICE TO THIS MAJOR VEHICLE.

<P>
James Earl Jones took such larger-than-life steps on Broadway and in Los 
Angeles as Troy Maxson, the baseball player-turned-frustrated trash collector 
in August Wilson's "Fences," that anyone who saw him might well wonder whether 
any other actor could fill Maxson's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego premiere of "Fences" by Southeast Community Theatre at the Lyceum 
Space proves that this work does not need a star to remain a major vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
It won a Pulitzer Prize and the Tony Award not because of the immensely 
talented Jones -- who was indeed dazzling -- but because "Fences" is a terrific 
piece of work. 
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of Floyd Gaffney, the UC San Diego professor responsible 
for nearly every locally cast African American production in San Diego, a 
strong ensemble cast takes turns aiming at Wilson's rich text, and knocks the 
ball over the fence more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what makes Wilson's work so compelling is that he uses fiction to tell 
the truth. Through Maxson, the play tells the story of the pain of one-time 
black ballplayers who never got the chance at major league baseball before 
1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the color line. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just historical truth that Wilson is interested in, it's emotional 
truth. His Maxson is no hero; he's charming, funny and a great spinner of tall 
tales, but he is also a frustrated man who takes his frustrations out on his 
family. And one can understand why. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio (T. J.) Johnson puts depth beneath the swagger in the role of Maxson, a 
man who was thrown out of his father's house when he was 14. He ends up making 
his way in the world as best he can, marrying young, fathering a child, 
stealing -- and doing 15 years in prison for one of those robberies. 
</P>
<P>
He was sent to prison as a teen-ager, where he discovers he has a love and 
talent for baseball. But like the real-life black baseball slugger Josh Gibson, 
who may have been the model for the role, he is too old for the game by the 
time Robinson integrated the league in 1947. Gibson died in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
As the play begins in 1957, we find Maxson living out the rest of his life on 
the bench. Now 53, he keeps keeps going, but not without dying a little inside 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
He's collecting other people's trash in Pittsburgh after starting a second 
life. He is making a home with his wife of 18 years; his second son; his 
brother, Gabriel, who had part of his mind blown away in World War II, and a 
friend, Jim Bono. 
</P>
<P>
Is he angry? Sure. Does he support his second son, Cory, also a natural 
athlete, when he is recruited to play college football? Not a chance. Does his 
love for his wife help him resist the temptation of other women? Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Maxson is a flawed human being, and yet Wilson's genius lies in making you care 
for the aches of this very complex and sometimes brutish man. 
</P>
<P>
He does this partly through Maxson's wife, Rose, eloquently played by Sylvia 
M'Lafi Thompson. Rose is the moral center through which we judge Maxson. Her 
anger is our anger, her pain at what he's done is our pain, and ultimately her 
love and forgiveness is the signal that it is time for us all to suspend 
judgment for a while. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever Maxson did or didn't manage to accomplish with his life, attention 
must be paid. 
</P>
<P>
Attention is also paid to the technical details in this tenderly mounted 
production. 
</P>
<P>
The set, by Ocie Robinson, is a wonderfully realistic depiction of a poor brick 
house, in front of which the ever-present bat and the ball suspended by a 
string speak volumes about where Maxson's heart still remains. David Coons' 
lighting captures the changing times of day. The costumes by Marian Laubert 
re-create the flavor of the period. The sound by Dirk Mahabir fills the mood 
with mournful to high-stepping strains. 
</P>
<P>
The roles of the sons prove most tentative here; it's as if the actors, like 
the sons themselves, have not quite settled on the best way to relate to this 
troublesome and troubling father. 
</P>
<P>
Shanga K. Parker brings strength and almost too much intelligence to Cory, the 
second son who locks horns with his father. The conflict would have come across 
more clearly had he been more pronouncedly like his father, and like his 
father, had less of a handle on what emotions were driving his life. 
</P>
<P>
Grandison M. Phelps III also stumbles a bit as the first-born son, Lyons; one 
expects him to be a bit more of a hip, street-smart talker, but his anxious 
desire for his father's attention does come across loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Bryant provides backbone to the story as Maxson's best friend Jim Bono, 
who is looking to Maxson -- of all people -- for clues as to how to get through 
his own life as best he can. Joel Brisker brings a touch of the bright-eyed 
supernatural to the part of Gabriel, a crazy who may just have more of a 
pipeline to heaven than the others realize. 
</P>
<P>
This production is an extraordinary play that should put another feather in the 
cap of Southeast Community Theatre, which continues to play a unique and vital 
role in producing the masterpieces of African American theater in San Diego. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: ANNUAL BEACH BOYS-PADRES 
DOUBLE HEADER BAILED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a while it was looking as if there wouldn't be a Beach Boys-Padres 
doubleheader at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium this year, as there had been 
every year since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The popular event, consisting of a baseball game followed by a concert and 
generally held in May, was in jeopardy due to the possibility of a baseball 
strike and scheduling conflicts that resulted in the Beach Boys being booked, 
instead, into the San Diego Sports Arena on May 1 for a special Texaco 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
But last Monday, promoter Mike Fahn, who has produced the annual stadium 
pairing since 1984, surprised many skeptics when 
</P>
<P>
he announced that a Beach Boys/Padres date had, in fact, been confirmed: 
Sunday, Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"There was quite a bit of doubt earlier when the Beach Boys' and the Padres' 
schedules conflicted and wouldn't allow us to produce the show in the 
traditional early May," Fahn said. "But we continued to pursue it just as we 
did in 1987, when a similar situation took place in terms of conflicts of 
scheduling and we did the show in October. 
</P>

And it really is a tradition: People have been asking me about this ever since 
the last one was over."

The owners of the Pink Panther in Bay Park and the Casbah in Middletown, two 
popular hangouts for trendy local rock 'n' rollers, are throwing a Cinco de 
Mayo party Saturday at the Mission Bay Ballroom in the Bahia Resort Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The music alone is reason enough for going. The featured attraction is El Vez, 
the self-proclaimed "Mexican Elvis," whose repertoire of 30-plus Presley 
classics with a Latino twist includes "You Ain't Nothing But a Chihuahua," "In 
the Barrio," and a mariachi-style arrangement of "Love Me Tender." Unlike his 
debut San Diego appearance last February at the Casbah, El Vez -- in real life, 
Los Angeles pop-art gallery owner, and Chula Vista native, Robert Lopez -- will 
be accompanied by a full backup band, the Memphis Mariachis. Also on the bill: 
the Strolling Mariachi Brothers -- consisting of Peter Verbrugge, co-owner of 
the two clubs, and Dennis Borlek and Steve Foth of Carnivorous Lunar Activity 
-- and local psychedelic funksters Daddy Longlegs. 
</P>
<P>
If you're more into the traditional stuff, consider attending the Cinco de Mayo 
Fiesta, Saturday and Sunday at the Old Town State Historic Park. 
</P>
<P>
Among the performers will be 7-year-old Carlitos, singing traditional and 
contemporary Mexican ballads; Huayucaltia, a Los Angeles group playing Latin 
American folk music; and local salsa bands Afro Rumba and the Benny Holman 
Latin Big Band Explosion.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'FUNNY FACE' TO CLOSE AFI FILM FESTIVAL

A fresh print of Stanley Donen's glorious 1957 "Funny Face" closes the AFI Film 
Festival on Thursday and then opens a one-week revival at the AMC Century 14. 
Fred Astaire stars as a Richard Avedon-ish fashion photographer and Audrey 
Hepburn is a mousy Greenwich Village bluestocking transformed into a radiant 
model. 
</P>
<P>
Featuring Gershwin standards, "Funny Face" is even more enjoyable than when it 
was new; they don't make witty, high-style, sophisticated romantic musicals 
like this anymore. 
</P>
<P>
A Norma Shearer retrospective gets under way at the L.A. County Museum of Arton 
Friday at 1 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. with "Marie Antoinette" (1938), a landmark 
costume picture in which Shearer nevertheless gives a remarkably shaded 
portrayal of a frustrated, frivolous but finally gallant and brave queen.

"THE WOMEN ON THE ROOF"(Sweden; Director: Carl-Gustaf Nykvist. Cineplex Century 
Plaza 2, 9:15 p.m.) Spellbinding coming-of-age tale: A menage a trois in 
pre-World War I Stockholm, between a naive young girl, a jaded 
porno-photographer and an acrobatic rover, rendered in tense tableaux, vivid 
performances and nervously romantic colors. An exciting directorial debut by 
Sven Nykvist's son, aided by Sweden's other great cinematographer, Jorgen 
Persson ("Elvira Madigan"). (Michael Wilmington). 
</P>
<P>
"VIENNA IS DIFFERENT"(U.S.; D: Susan Korda, David Leitner. AFI Warner, 7 p.m.) 
As Vienna celebrated 50 years of the Anschluss, its annexation to Germany by 
Hitler, simultaneously with the Waldheim controversy in March-April 1988, 
American documentary filmmakers Korda and Leitner were there. Their interviews 
were frank, verging on rude, but the result is many-layered and mesmerizing. 
Terrific stuff. (Sheila Benson). 
</P>
<P>
"A TRIBUTE TO STANLEY DONEN"(Century Plaza 3, 7 p.m.) One of the two great 
masters of the MGM movie musical joins the audience and faces the music -- 
along with clips from his films. Moderator: Albert Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"FLYING FOX IN A FREEDOM TREE"(New Zealand; D: Martyn Sanderson. Century Plaza 
3, 9:15 p.m.) Although marred by awkward, self-conscious performances from some 
of the nonprofessional actors, this is an affecting, perceptive coming-of-age 
tale, taken from Albert Wendt's novel about a Samoan youth caught in a cultural 
conflict, but sustained by his shaman-like Europolynesian friend. (Kevin 
Thomas) Compiled by Michael Wilmington

PIANO QUARTET PLAYS NEW HARTKE COMPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A concert by the Los Angeles Piano Quartet -- played to a sizable, 
knowledgeable audience at Royce Hall, UCLA, on Sunday -- provided further 
evidence that the LAPQ may be this city's most potent and accomplished resident 
chamber ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
The quartet is to be admired for its polished, penetrating interpretations and 
for enlarging the repertory for its combination of instruments. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion we heard the latest effort in its own behalf: the West Coast 
premiere of an instantly appealing (without populist pandering), handsomely 
crafted work, "The King of the Sun," commissioned from Stephen Hartke, the Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra's composer in residence and a member of the USC 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Hartke's 18-minute-long set of tableaux reacts to paintings of Joan Miro, 
reactions by turns clever-whimsical, as in the stutter-stepping, rhythmically 
complex, faintly jazzy "Personages in the night guided by the phosphorescent 
tracks of snails" (the personages seem to be doing their best not to step on 
the snails) or wistful-warm, as in the final "Personages and birds rejoicing at 
the arrival of night." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way one encounters a medieval hoedown, patches of plainchant and, at 
nearly every turn, rhythmic vitality and respect for the audience's 
intelligence as well as its desire to be entertained. 
</P>
<P>
That the performance was masterful hardly needs saying, but one should 
compliment the players -- pianist James Bonn, violinist Joseph Genualdi, 
violist Ronald Copes and cellist Peter Rejto -- for keeping the staples on the 
program equally spontaneous-sounding. 
</P>
<P>
There were no surprises in the C-minor Quartet of Faure (whose scherzo trio may 
have suggested the finale of Hartke's piece) or Schumann's E-flat Quartet, but 
both were played with such energetic affection and precision that they could be 
received as welcome old friends rather than tiresomely ubiquitous house guests.

HOUR OF COMMERCIALS BREAKS THE MONOTONY ON CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who of us has not proclaimed in fits of frustration that the TV commercials are 
a helluva lot better than these stupid, idiotic shows! 
</P>
<P>
A special tonight, tediously but not-inappropriately called "The World's 
Funniest, Cleverest, Most Imaginative Commercials" (10 p.m. on Channels 2 and 
8), puts that theory to the test. It's a nice break, if only for an hour. A 
nice break from the weary CBS schedule, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Producer/director/co-writer Andrew Solt makes no effort at making any point of 
it all, except that there were/are a lot of car commercials, kids are used a 
lot and, hey, aren't special effects silly? This is simply a hodge-podge from 
here and there, as hosted by comic David Leisure, who -- would I lie to you? -- 
gets to run only one of his car spots. 
</P>
<P>
These may not be the best of the best, because everybody has favorites. "Hey, 
Mikey!" isn't in here, or "Some Spicy Meatball." There are a group from 
commercial auteur Joe Sedelmaier, plus the Mean Joe Greene and the Kid spot, 
the California Raisins' "Grapevine" routine, etc. There's great pixilating and 
anthropomorphizing going on. We love the one where the chairs and tables love 
being caressed by this brand of sandpaper. 
</P>
<P>
There are delicious foreign entries, among them a spot from Zimbabwe that shows 
wild tribal dancers getting severely sore feet, so they all pad to the shoe 
store for their zany colored Bata brands, then resume the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Our special favorite was the Brazilian commercial of a riot scene in which cops 
attack protesters with water cannons, pull, yank and drag them around and lug 
them off -- and mostly the camera focuses on their behinds, which are all 
covered in Staroup jeans. 
</P>
<P>
A thought occurs: Maybe CBS can get back into this ratings race by running all 
commercials.

JUDGE SLAPS GABOR WITH EXTRA HOURS OF SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An angry Beverly Hills Municipal Court judge ordered Zsa Zsa Gabor to perform 
60 extra hours of community service Tuesday, saying fund raising at her Bel-Air 
mansion was not the way to serve time for slapping a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any violation of probation, County Jail will be the sanction," 
Municipal Judge Charles Rubin warned. 
</P>
<P>
He asked Gabor if she accepted his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, what can I do?" Gabor said. 
</P>
<P>
"You could go to jail. Do you want that?" the judge shot back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous," the former Hungarian beauty queen later told about 80 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, 72, was sentenced last year to 120 hours of community service on her 
conviction of slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman who stopped her 
Rolls-Royce last June for expired registration tags. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin originally ordered her to do the service at the Lower Income Elderly 
United Community Assistance Program in Venice, with the time to be completed by 
March 30. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin ordered Tuesday's hearing after he received a sparse account from the 
shelter's executive director, Vera Davis, about how Gabor spent her time. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Gabor spent about 50 hours at the shelter and the rest of the time 
working from her Bel-Air mansion, organiz ing a June 8 fund-raiser for the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to me the defendant had a rather lax attitude about it," Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"(It) means nothing to Miss Gabor, buying community service hours. She is a 
wealthy person," Rubin said after meeting with Gabor and her attorney, Harrison 
Bull, for 3 1/2 hours. "The primary motive was Miss Gabor's promotion, and not 
fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
"I repeated numerous times (at the original sentencing) that she perform 
community service at the center." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor later told reporters: "I served food. Why do I have to promote myself? 
I'm so damned famous it's sickening." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin gave Gabor credit for 34 1/2 hours of community service time from her 
120-hour sentence. He ordered her to serve the remaining 85 1/2 hours, plus 60 
penalty hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Gabor must now document her community service time and there will be 
random, in-person verification," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 145 1/2 hours must be completed by Sept. 28 and the hours will be 
served at several agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"You may not do any fund raising" as a part of the community service, the judge 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any qualms with Miss Gabor's assistance and fund raising," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox, but "there is an aspect of humility that goes 
along with this." 
</P>
<P>
He said community service usually includes handling telephones or serving food.

POLICE UNION LEADERS BACK MANDATORY DRUG TESTING; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: IN A SURPRISE TURNAROUND, THEY AGREE TO PUT THE ISSUE TO A 
VOTE OF MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of Los Angeles' largest police union, in an unexpected turnaround, have 
agreed to allow mandatory drug testing of all sworn officers and will put the 
Police Department's proposal before its membership later this month, the 
union's president said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If the Los Angeles Police Protective League's 7,800 members approve the plan, 
the drug testing could begin as early as June 1, LAPD officials said. 
</P>
<P>
With that target date in mind, the civilian Board of Police Commissioners, at 
the request of Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, on Tuesday agreed to ask Mayor Tom 
Bradley and the City Council for $27,000 to expand the department's current 
drug testing program, which now tests only newly hired officers and officers 
specifically suspected of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Random testing of non-union, command-level officers -- including Gates -- was 
scheduled to begin on Tuesday, but was postponed for a "couple of days" to work 
out some "procedural problems," said department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
The tests for police brass were announced last month after Police Protective 
League President George Aliano expressed strong opposition to a department-wide 
plan, contending that such testing was a contract issue and could not be 
arbitrarily imposed. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Aliano and other union leaders filed an unfair labor practice 
complaint over the testing issue with the city's Employee Relations Board. They 
cited a survey, Aliano said, showing that two-thirds of the union's members 
opposed modifying their four-year contract "in the middle of its term" to allow 
the testing. 
</P>
<P>
Aliano said Tuesday, however, that union leaders and Gates settled the issue 
about two weeks ago after a hearing on the complaint had begun. He would not 
reveal terms of the agreement, saying he wanted the union's membership to get 
that information directly from him rather than reading it in published reports. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say we have terms of agreement that will survive the contract," Aliano 
said. "It's not a reopening of the contract. It has no connection to the 
contract." Booth said the agreement involves "no major changes" in the 
department's original testing plan, "just little-bitty stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Aliano has said repeatedly that neither he nor union members were against drug 
testing in principle, but were concerned only with maintaining the integrity of 
their contract with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Union members, he said late last year, "want to show that they are drug-free 
just like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Aliano said Tuesday that the union leadership will urge members to approve the 
new agreement in a vote he expected to take place sometime this month. He said 
he expects the rank-and-file to adopt the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved, he said, the LAPD will be the first department in 
the country, to his knowledge, to institute department-wide mandatory drug 
testing without a legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of no other that has done it without being ordered by a court," Aliano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the LAPD plan proposed by Gates late last year, the department's medical 
liaison staff would regularly collect urine samples from officers randomly 
selected by computer. 
</P>
<P>
If an officer's test results are positive, the agreement contains provisions 
for retesting by independent laboratories. An individual with a confirmed 
positive result would face termination. 
</P>
<P>
Booth has said that the LAPD, which has about 8,150 members, fires about 10 
officers annually for drug abuse.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESTAURANT MANAGER SHOT TO DEATH BY ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The manager of a restaurant in Playa del Rey was shot to death when one of two 
robbers opened fire for no apparent reason, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Chuck Worthen of the LAPD's Pacific Division station said the robbers 
entered the Bob's Big Boy cafe in the 8000 block of Manchester Boulevard about 
11 p.m. Monday, an hour after closing time. The pair produced guns, walked up 
to the manager, 29-year-old Albert Brodeur Jr. of Redondo Beach, and demanded 
money, Worthen said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Brodeur could respond, one of the men shot him several times, police 
said. Both men ran from the restaurant. It was not immediately determined 
whether any money was taken.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CAMPAIGN TO RESETTLE SOVIET JEWS BEGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley joined a group of local Jewish leaders Tuesday to 
launch "Operation Exodus," a campaign to raise $36 million by 1992 to help 
resettle Soviet Jews in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The protection of human rights is the most noble endeavor in the world," 
Bradley declared. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why I ardently support Operation Exodus, which has, as its foundation, 
the protection of human rights for Soviet Jews who want to resettle in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gunther, a co-chairman of the Honorary Operation Exodus Committee, said 
about 1 million Soviet Jews have applied for exit visas to move to Israel. 
Since the beginning of the year alone, 17,759 Soviet Jews have immigrated. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the American Jewish community hopes to raise $420 million to 
support the resettlement effort.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRW TO SHUT DOWN TEST SYSTEMS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRW Inc. has announced that it is shutting down its Electronic Test Systems 
Skills Center in Redondo Beach, a 160-person unit involved in testing 
spacecraft instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The company said 30 to 60 employees would be transferred to San Diego County as 
part of an adjustment to "this era of defense spending restraints." 
</P>
<P>
"TRW will make every effort to place the remaining employees in other jobs in 
TRW operations in Redondo Beach or elsewhere," said spokeswoman Montye Male. 
"We expect that other assignments will absorb a significant portion of them. It 
is unnecessary for us to move all the people down there, because we have 
people" in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Male said the operations of the Redondo Beach unit will be merged with TRW's 
Military Electronics and Avionics Division, which employs 800 people in Rancho 
Carmel in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Both units are part of TRW's Space and Defense Sector, which has 18,000 
employees in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of similar units will save TRW money because the company 
expects that "concentrations of skills in one area will decrease our costs," 
Male said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CYCLE DEATH RISK PUT AT 20 TIMES THAT OF 
CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorcyclist is 20 to 30 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident 
than a person in a car, according to a study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors described motorcyclists' injuries in traffic accidents as "the worst 
trauma they treat outside of a war combat zone." 
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,661 motorcyclists died in crashes in 1988, said Dr. Elizabeth 
McLoughlin, author of "Fatal Injuries to California Motorcyclists." 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, 
McLoughlin, of the San Francisco Injury Center for Research and Prevention, was 
joined by motorcycle safety advocates who support mandatory helmet laws. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Claybrook, a longtime consumer product safety activist and co-chairwoman 
of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, urged Gov. George Deukmejian to "look 
at the ease of enforcing such a law. Look at the families who have suffered." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has twice vetoed legislation that would have required motorcyclists 
to wear helmets in California. Many motorcyclists opposed the law on civil 
liberty grounds, arguing that a rider should have the personal freedom to wear 
a helmet or not.

ATTEMPT MADE TO SAVE FOOT PATROLS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL: THE EFFORT MAY CONTINUE A POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND 
POLICE CHIEF OVER THE COSTLY PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heeding warnings that Police Chief Daryl F. Gates would end a popular foot 
patrol program in some areas of the city unless he received additional city 
funds, two City Council members Tuesday introduced a motion to provide the 
$407,000 Gates says he needs. 
</P>
<P>
The additional money, to come from the city's nearly depleted reserve fund, 
would enable the Police Department to continue to deploy 60 officers on 
overtime at 13 crime hot spots in selected areas of the city through the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Other foot patrols in such areas as downtown, Venice and Westwood, which are 
not part of the Secured Area Footbeat Program, are funded by the department's 
regular budget and are not in danger of being phased out. 
</P>
<P>
The motion, made by Councilman Nate Holden and seconded by Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, will likely continue the power struggle between the council and 
Gates over funding for the popular, though expensive program. The matter is 
expected to be considered by the council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't place a dollar figure on the lives of innocent people," Holden said. 
"The program has proven to be effective and the City Council has the money. 
Let's spend it on a good cause." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the council received conflicting reports from the city 
administrative office and the Police Department about the availability of funds 
for the program within the police overtime account, which has $4.8 million 
remaining for the rest of the fiscal year that ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Administrative office staff said the money was available for foot patrols, but 
Gates insisted it was already earmarked to keep officers available in patrol 
cars, for homicide investigations and court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Flores to provide $500,000 to police from the reserve fund was 
rejected in a 7-5 vote, one short of passage. 
</P>
<P>
The council subsequently unanimously approved a proposal by Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee, to provide $93,000 
from the general fund and require police to get the remaining $407,000 from the 
overtime account. 
</P>
<P>
Following the vote, Gates angrily berated the council for trying to 
"micromanage" his department and announced he would phase out most of the foot 
patrols due to the lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the money. I've said it over and over again," Gates told 
reporters. "I will deploy the police in this city, and I will deploy them 
according to what I have in the way of funds. Some of the foot beats will come 
off. There are some we think are important to keep, but most of them will come 
off." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Flores acknowledged that the city is facing a major financial 
crunch and possible deficits in the coming years, but she said the foot patrols 
should remain. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question we have a shortage of money right now. But we have to get 
our priorities straight, and I believe the citizens of Los Angeles feel this is 
a priority and it worked. If something works you don't suddenly withdraw it and 
say we can't afford it anymore," Flores said.

JUDGE THREATENS TO JAIL ZSA ZSA, SLAPS HER WITH 60 MORE HOURS OF DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought it was safe to return to Beverly Hills Municipal Court, a 
simple hearing Tuesday over whether celebrity cop-slapper Zsa Zsa Gabor had 
indeed given 120 hours of community service escalated into a four-hour judicial 
extravaganza -- broadcast live and in color. 
</P>
<P>
And when it was over, the man Gabor calls "that nasty judge" had branded her an 
opportunist, slapped her with 60 additional hours of community service for 
probation violation and threatened to send her to jail if she didn't cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
As always, however, the loquacious Hungarian actress had the last word. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so damn famous it's sickening," she said, sweeping out of the courtroom on 
the arm of her husband, the Prince von Anhalt, in a waft of Van Cleef &amp; 
Arpels perfume. Her remark was in response to the judge calling her a publicity 
hound. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, who would prefer to see herself as a wronged heroine, vowed to press on 
with her work for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need his telling me what to do," she said of Municipal Judge Charles 
Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin had sentenced Gabor last October to three days in jail and a psychiatric 
evaluation -- as well as nearly $13,000 in fines and fees and 120 days of 
community service -- after a jury convicted her of striking a police officer 
who had stopped her Rolls-Royce for having expired tags. Her attorney, Harrison 
Bull, has filed an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gabor donated time to the Low Income Elderly United Community 
Assistance Program (LIEU-CAP), a Westside shelter for homeless women for which 
she is scheduled to hold a celebrity fund-raiser next month. 
</P>
<P>
She found an unlikely ally in the program's feisty founder, Vera Davis 
McClendon, who testified Tuesday that Gabor had actually served 138 hours of 
community service -- answering telephones, visiting with the women and 
children, serving food, making public appearances to benefit the center, 
planning the fund-raiser and even personally arranging shelter for a mother and 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that the publicity garnered by Gabor greatly benefited the center 
economically, Davis (who prefers that designation) described her as "not an 
ordinary person" but "the most high-caliber person we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you referring to her notoriety?" asked Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"To her status as a celebrity," answered Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis could only document 34 1/2 hours actually spent by Gabor at the shelter, 
but said she credited the talk-show star with "preparation time" spent on 
travel or makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's attorney called several other witnesses who testified about her efforts 
to help the financially strapped center. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing attracted a large audience of Gabor followers, the idly curious, 
paparazzi and reporters. An all-news network televised portions of the event 
live. At times, it took on the appearance of theater, with the audience 
applauding testimony favorable to Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor kept quiet through most of the hearing. She sat with her back to the 
judge. She wore gold eye shadow, false eyelashes, and a suede riding jacket 
over a leopard-print Dior blouse and an Anne Klein sarong. Her silver-blonde 
hair was tied back with a bow and accented by large diamond earrings. 
</P>
<P>
The judge called witnesses of his own to assess Gabor's performance. In 
addition to Davis, the judge called two employees of the Volunteer Center of 
West Los Angeles, which placed her at the shelter. One of them testified that 
she had explained to Davis that Gabor was to do office work and "specifically 
no fund raising." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Judge Rubin found that the former Miss Hungary had violated 
conditions of her probation. He said that Davis had been blinded by her dazzle. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Gabor led her down the primrose path and that's unfortunate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sanctions, however, he said he would credit Gabor with 34 1/2 hours 
of community service -- "some of which I have gross doubts about" -- require 
her to serve the remaining 85 1/2 hours, and add another 60 hours. She must 
serve all remaining 145 1/2 hours before Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Davis ordered, Gabor must be monitored by the volunteer agency 
responsible for placing her to ensure that she is physically present at her 
community service assignment. No fund raising will be permitted, he said, 
although it is unclear whether she will have to cancel her scheduled benefit 
for the homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Any violations will result in her going to county jail, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, asked about her readiness to go to the women's facility, 
Sybil Brand Institute for Women, Gabor flashed a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Sybil Brand (the still-active philanthropist for whom the jail is named) is a 
good friend of mine," she said, not missing a beat. "I'm having dinner with her 
tomorrow night."

FIRM TO SET UP SCHOLARSHIPS, PAY FINE IN TOXIC FIRE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York-based chemical company pleaded no contest Tuesday to criminal 
charges of mishandling hazardous wastes and agreed to pay a $400,000 fine and 
contribute $350,000 to scholarships at five Los Angeles-area high schools, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles district attorney's office filed criminal charges against Grow 
Group Inc. in 1988, three months after fires in its Commerce plant spewed toxic 
clouds over Southeast Los Angeles and forced the evacuation of nearly 28,000 
residents from Montebello to Monterey Park during the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The company pleaded no contest to one felony count and three misdemeanor counts 
of violating the California Hazardous Waste Control Act, the district 
attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the scholarship funds for 
environmental education at the high schools are unique. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, this has never been done before," she said. "Because the 
money will be put in an annuity, the high schools will receive money in 
perpetuity." 
</P>
<P>
The schools that will receive the funds are Montebello High School, Bell 
Gardens High School, Schurr High School in Montebello, Pioneer High School in 
Whittier and El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Grow Group President Russell Banks said in a statement Tuesday that the company 
and its executives were neither admitting nor denying the allegations by 
settling the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the settlement was deemed to be "in the best interests of the 
company, by avoiding the expenses and distraction of a prolonged preliminary 
hearing and trial and by alleviating the adverse impact the proceedings have 
had on the company's operations since September, 1988, when the fires 
occurred."

15 ARRESTED IN MAY DAY DISTURBANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ and JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A May Day rally in MacArthur Park just west of downtown Los Angeles ended in 
violence and at least 15 arrests Tuesday when members of the Revolutionary 
Communist Party and Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade clashed with about 40 
riot-clad officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One marcher threw a bottle at an officer and fled to a restaurant where he was 
arrested, officers said. Another demonstrator allegedly hurled rocks and a 
five-gallon tar can at officers from a second-story perch and cried, "Shoot me! 
Shoot me!" 
</P>
<P>
Two firefighters climbed a ladder to reach the man, sitting on a signpost mount 
at an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center at 1115 Alvarado 
St., and herded him into the arms of several police officers on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Marchers chained the doors of the center, piled tires in front of the building 
and planned "to set them on fire," said Sgt. Jim Mateer. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when we moved in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, police said, they booked one demonstrator on a charge of assault with a 
deadly weapon, held two for spray-painting the initials "RCP" on walls, 
arrested two others on charges of interfering with a police officer and booked 
10 for various other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started about an hour after approximately 100 people rallied in 
MacArthur Park at midafternoon, waving red flags, blowing whistles and yelling 
to protest resident-only barricades set up a year ago in the Pico-Union area to 
combat drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who live in this area are mostly immigrants, and they are under a 
lockdown," said Lucas Martinez, a spokesman for the May Day Committee 1990, 
which helped organize Tuesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
Residents should not be held "hostage" because of what drug dealers do, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Watched by police, marchers set off at 4 p.m., heading south on Alvarado from 
7th Street. They shouted at officers making an arrest, and four demonstrators 
were taken into custody, two on charges of trying to take a prisoner away from 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Police ordered the marchers to disperse, but they gathered again at the INS 
center. More officers arrived, and a police helicopter flew overhead. When the 
demonstrators refused to disperse a second time, police moved in. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon said several people suffered minor injuries, 
including a sergeant and two officers, who were hit with unknown objects.

INSURER'S EMPLOYEES GET THEIR DIGS IN WITH UNDERGROUND PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An underground needle keeps popping corporate balloons at 20th Century 
Insurance Co. despite the company's best efforts to blunt it. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, workers have stashed copies of an underground newspaper, 
dubbed 20th Century RagTime, in elevators, on desks and even in lunchroom 
refrigerators at California's sixth-largest insurer. The two-page paper is 
packed with mock interviews, spoofs and jibes at what the editors consider 
stodgy management policies. 
</P>
<P>
Management, for its part, is not amused and has tried to discourage the paper 
and ferret out its publishers. According to employees and a former manager at 
the Woodland Hills firm, this effort has included scrutinizing videotapes from 
the company's security cameras, "staking out" certain hallways and searching 
desks. 
</P>
<P>
Only one manager at 20th Century would comment on the newspaper, and his 
remarks were brief. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unauthorized," said Rick Andre, vice president of human resources. "I 
wouldn't even call it a publication. I don't know what you'd call it. It was 
someone's attempt at being humorous. Beyond that, I have nothing else to add." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of RagTime is columnist Myra Atkins, a fictitious 
mailroom-overachiever who appears as a quirky pencil drawing above her column 
of satirical advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Myra," a reader writes. "Isn't charging employees for parking the same as 
giving us a pay cut?" Replies Myra: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Myra," queries another. "Ever since the no-smoking rule went into effect, 
I've noticed that smokers (who must go outside to smoke) get more extra little 
breaks than nonsmokers. What do you think I should do?" Says Myra: "Take up 
smoking." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the company's 1,700 employees began wearing "I Myra buttons" until 
company President Melville P. Windle discouraged the display of allegiance. 
Windle, like other 20th Century executives, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Beaber, a psychologist and attorney in West Los Angeles who has mediated 
employee-management disputes, said underground newspapers, a rare occurrence in 
the workplace, appear when other avenues of expression are closed to employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The very existence of such a newspaper suggests employees feel like they work 
in a repressive environment where open communication about dissatisfaction is 
too risky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees who spoke about the newspaper said they generally regard 20th Century 
as a good place to work but said they are irritated by a constant stream of 
corporate programs -- charity campaigns, incentive and service awards -- all 
delivered with an upbeat tone that they consider patronizing. 
</P>
<P>
One incentive award, immediately lampooned in RagTime, was a a 
hockey-puck-sized medallion with the company emblem on one side and a likeness 
of Chairman Lewis W. Foster on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"It was originally done just for a laugh," a RagTime editor said of the 
newspaper. "I found people could really relate to Myra, so I used her. She's 
one of us, a decent person who has a sense of humor. She's a straight-shooter 
who doesn't use corporate doublespeak. Myra voices what most people think, but 
are afraid to say." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (the administration) understood RagTime's intent," said former 
auditing director Jim Prater. "I think they were intimidated by it." Some 
managers were amused by the publication at first, Prater said, but after 
observing the reaction at the executive level, they realized that the 
publication was not to be openly enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
RagTime has appeared just seven times. But growing circulation of back issues 
and Atkins' widespread popularity prompted administrators to strengthen their 
resistence. 
</P>
<P>
Prater said he used to spend hours screening videotapes from the security 
cameras trying to spot employees carrying large handbags or bulging briefcases 
that might contain bundles of the banned publication. 
</P>
<P>
Other employees said desks have been searched, hallways staked out and several 
suspects questioned, but few solid clues have appeared. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the corporate warnings, RagTime editors have only redoubled 
their efforts. After the second issue appeared, administrators distributed 
memos labeling the paper illegal and libelous. The memo was printed in the next 
issue of RagTime. 
</P>
<P>
The editors simultaneously faxed the April issue -- the latest -- to six 
locations within the home office and to six branch offices. In an effort to 
trace the sender, auditing director Larry Johnson followed a paper trail 
leading to several stores where the faxed copies originated. 
</P>

"He's been here four times in the past week," said Marc Wagman, manager of QIP 
Printing in Woodland Hills. "He was very persistent. He brought in pictures of

Because in-house distribution has grown risky, recent issues were mailed from

"Most callers want back issues or future issues mailed directly to their

"People definitely know where to get it," said an employee who asked to be 
anonymous. "Everybody loves it. We're always waiting for the next issue."

JAMES FLANIGAN: U.S. FIRMS CAN MAKE IT IN GLOBAL MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sadly, just as world markets are opening up, self-doubt has replaced 
self-confidence in America. 
</P>
<P>
Openly and loudly Americans fear foreign investment, while secretly worrying 
whether U.S. companies can hack it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
But both fear and worry are overdone as the example of a Midwestern family 
business will make clear. 
</P>
<P>
This is the story of how Hobart Bros., a medium-sized welding company in Troy, 
Ohio, (population, 20,000) learned to stop worrying and love the global market. 
</P>
<P>
Hobart does roughly $300 million a year in sales of welding equipment and 
passenger-loading systems for airports -- one-third of the sales overseas where 
it has joint ventures in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
At home, Hobart plays the world citizen, too. It was responsible in 1987 for 
persuading Matsushita (Panasonic) to set up a picture tube plant in Troy, which 
is near Dayton in southwestern Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one world market today," says Chairman William Hobart, 65, the third 
generation of his family to run the 73-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
That seems easy for him to say because Hobart is enjoying rising sales and 
record profits and looking forward confidently to a united European market in 
1992 and to new business in Japan, where it has an order to supply passenger 
bridges for Osaka Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But like most companies in the industrial Midwest, Hobart is more a story of 
survival than simple success. It's a company that has come through bad times 
and learned some lessons, and so it sees the world differently today than 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
Until the recession of 1982, Hobart was almost solely a welding company -- 
meaning it sold electrodes and power equipment for fusing steel at temperatures 
of 6,000 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Welding was a secure business, with all of U.S. manufacturing as its customers, 
from the automobile industry to farm equipment and machine tools. Welding 
almost never had a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the 1980s, the U.S. welding business went into reverse; total industry 
sales of $1.9 billion are no higher now than in 1981, according to Welding 
Design magazine -- which means that counting inflation they're lower. 
</P>
<P>
What happened, says Hobart, is that "the whole U.S. economy, maybe the world 
economy, has gone through turmoil and change. Competition is greater." The 
United States got a rude awakening, he says. "As a nation we were living as if 
we had No. 1 status all to ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
That all changed with the 1982 recession and the pressure of foreign 
competition. "The 80,000 rail cars built each year fell to 6,000," says Hobart. 
"Many of the companies have never recovered, they're smaller." 
</P>
<P>
Why smaller? Some shrinkage resulted from broad industrial change. Cars and 
other products contain less metal, more plastic these days; big companies 
farmed out metalworking to smaller job shops. 
</P>
<P>
But some wounds were self-inflicted. "The big capital investors in our business 
-- Dana, Foster Wheeler, Babcock &amp; Wilcox -- stopped investing in 
productivity-increasing equipment," says Hobart. 
</P>
<P>
"Nonproductive capital movements hurt U.S. industry -- you tell me how highly 
leveraged buyouts helped U.S. companies invest in themselves," adds Kim 
Packard, 51, Hobart's president since 1985 and the first non-family member to 
run the company. 
</P>
<P>
As customers shrank, so did Hobart's business. Some U.S. welding companies gave 
up. Union Carbide and Air Reduction, two companies harried by takeover battles 
in the 1980s, dropped out of welding equipment. A Swedish company named Esab 
bought their operations and may now be the world's largest welder. 
</P>
<P>
Only Hobart -- and family-owned Miller Electric of Appleton, Wis., and 
employee-owned Lincoln Electric of Cleveland -- remain U.S.-owned. 
</P>
<P>
But Hobart didn't wait around for U.S. customers to come back. It acquired some 
airport equipment makers -- adding to one of its own product lines -- and 
sought business overseas. 
</P>
<P>
In welding, it formed a joint venture with Yaskawa of Japan to make welding 
robots and other automation products. In Europe, it has formed ventures with 
Swedish, Italian and Swiss companies. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the Ohio company is finding international markets more congenial 
than domestic. For instance, it is having great success overseas with a new 
welding technology that cuts power usage by 25% to 30% -- although it finds 
U.S. customers resisting the innovation, preferring to use old equipment rather 
than make a cost-saving investment. 
</P>
<P>
And Hobart says one of its best breaks in the '80s was a sale of welding wire 
to Matsushita, which fostered the relationship that resulted in the Osaka 
company setting up in Troy. "They're bringing good industry, and they're in for 
the long-term," says Hobart. "I'd trust them a lot more than some U.S. 
investors I know of." 
</P>
<P>
The lesson, of course, is that the world has changed. And either you see that 
as cause for worry about U.S. power and influence, or as fresh opportunity. 
Hobart, seizing the opportunity, has adopted the healthier attitude. Which 
happens to be the traditional American attitude. So why isn't it still?

BANK ACQUISITION WILL GIVE CITICORP JUMP IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citicorp confirmed Tuesday that it plans to buy a small Silicon Valley bank, a 
deal that will allow the New York giant to expand quickly in California once 
the state's interstate banking barriers are eased in January. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of DeAnza Holding Corp. in Sunnyvale, parent of DeAnza Bank, is 
expected to cost Citicorp about $8 million. The acquisition would be effective 
after Jan. 1, the date California's interstate banking barriers are relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
With two branches and only $35 million in assets, DeAnza would be a tiny 
acquisition for Citicorp, the nation's largest banking firm with $230 billion 
in assets. But with a California banking charter in hand, Citicorp will be able 
to move promptly in buying other commercial banks in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp already operates Citibank FSB, an Oakland-based thrift formed by its 
1983 acquisition of the failed Fidelity Savings &amp; Loan in Oakland. But 
Citicorp cannot buy commercial banks in California under the state's current 
banking laws. 
</P>
<P>
The move is a clear signal that expansion in California is one of Citicorp's 
top priorities because of the state's lucrative consumer banking market, 
including credit cards, home loans, home equity lending and car loans. In 
addition, banks in California have more liberal real estate investment powers 
than banks elsewhere. They also are being allowed to sell insurance under 
Proposition 103, the insurance initiative passed by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some banking experts speculated that Citicorp may be buying DeAnza in order to 
fold its thrift operation into the bank next year. But David A. Brooks, 
chairman of Citibank FSB, said Citicorp is still undecided about making that 
move because the advantages of doing it may not be worth the legal and other 
costs required. 
</P>
<P>
California has limited interstate banking laws now that allow banks in most 
Western states to operate full-service branches in California. Under the 
California Interstate Banking Act of 1986, banks nationwide will be allowed to 
acquire banks and operate branches in California if they are based in states 
that allow California banks to operate there. 
</P>
<P>
California banking experts disagree about what will happen after the banking 
laws are eased Jan. 1. Although Citicorp is expected to be active, the 
consensus among bankers now is that the full-scale invasion by giant New York 
and Chicago banks that was once envisioned will not take place because many of 
those banks have been weakened by bad foreign and real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the leader among out-of-state banks in taking advantage of California's 
new laws is Comerica in Detroit. Last year, Comerica agreed to buy Plaza 
Commerce Bancorp in San Jose effective Jan. 1 for about $117 million. It has 
also agreed to buy InBancshares in the City of Industry for about $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
California will ease its interstate banking laws on Jan. 1, opening up the 
state's lucrative banking market to out-of-state banks, including some of the 
nation's largest. The law will allow them to buy California banks or to set up 
new branches here if they are headquartered in states that allow California 
banks to operate freely. Already, banks in 11 Western states may enter 
California unless they are based in states that inhibit California banks' 
operations.

FORMER INSIDE TRADER REVIEWS HIS MISDEEDS; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: DENNIS LEVINE SAYS IN A MAGAZINE ARTICLE THAT HIS DOWNFALL WAS 
WELL DESERVED. 
</P>

<P>
Former inside trader Dennis B. Levine, out of prison now and struggling to 
resume a normal life, has gone public with a breast-beating mea culpa in the 
latest issue of Fortune magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The former investment banker, who in the mid-1980s turned $39,000 into more 
than $11 million from illegal trading, states that his subsequent downfall was 
well deserved. In a first-person, bylined article in the magazine's May 21 
edition, Levine writes: 
</P>
<P>
"I will regret my mistakes forever. I blame only myself for my actions and 
accept full responsibility for what I have done. No one led me down the garden 
path." 
</P>
<P>
In the article, Levine says the experience reinforced his faith in American 
justice. "When I broke the law, I was punished. The system works." 
</P>
<P>
But Levine doesn't dwell much on the chain of events he set in motion when he 
agreed to plead guilty to four felonies in 1986. Information he shared with 
prosecutors touched off the biggest securities fraud investigation in history, 
toppling former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and a slew of other prominent 
financiers, including, most recently, Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Levine merely notes that when he decided to plead, "Everyone else involved in 
(Levine's specific) case also entered guilty pleas and cooperated." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Loeb, the magazine's managing editor, said in a telephone interview 
that the article came about as a result of an offer first put to Levine in 
1986. The magazine didn't hear back from him, however, until late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Levine doesn't reveal much that wasn't already in newspaper accounts and the 
book "Levine &amp; Co." by Times staff writer Douglas Frantz. But he does 
forthrightly retell how he used his access to confidential information about 
pending takeover and merger deals to place personal orders for stock through 
offshore banks. 
</P>
<P>
In a succession of jobs, beginning at Citicorp and then Smith Barney, Harris 
Upham &amp; Co.; Lehman Bros. Kuhn Loeb, and finally Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
Levine was directly involved in advising companies on takeovers or leveraged 
buyouts. He writes that "eventually insider trading became an addiction for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
He also describes Boesky's relentless efforts to lure him into a scheme in 
which Boesky would pay him handsomely for tips about deals at Drexel. "He had 
such an insatiable desire for information that he would call me up to a dozen 
times a day," Levine says. "I turned Ivan down and resisted his overtures for 
weeks." But eventually Levine relented. 
</P>
<P>
Since he was released last year from a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa., Levine 
has opened a financial consulting business and gone on the college lecture 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Levine talks about the toll of his misdeeds and punishment on his family. 
"Saying goodby to your family is painful enough, but imagine having to explain 
to your 5-year-old son why his father is going to prison," he says. Despite his 
acceptance of his own punishment, Levine says he isn't convinced that prisons 
are a cure for society's ills. 
</P>
<P>
Loeb said Levine was paid for the article at the magazine's usual rate for 
free-lancers. He declined to specify how much.

OPEC PRESIDENT CALLS FOR SLASH IN OIL PRODUCTION 
</P>

<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries needs cut to oil production 
by as much as 1.5 million barrels a day to help crude prices recover from their 
recent slide, OPEC's president said Tuesday as cartel ministers arrived for an 
emergency meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The cartel's president, Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena, called the 
meeting for today to try to curb overproduction and boost prices that have 
dropped by more than 20% since January. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether OPEC should lower its official production ceiling or 
alternatively cut its output, thus officially acknowledging violations of 
individual member quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue is whether quota violators should bear the burden of any 
reduction or whether all 13 members should contribute equally. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say violations by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates 
have pushed OPEC output above the cartel's self-imposed ceiling of 22.1 million 
barrels a day for the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
On arriving in Geneva, Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi said OPEC's 
daily output currently was between 23.7 million barrels and 24 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Overproduction has caused a glut during a time of seasonally slackening demand 
in the second quarter. That has depressed prices well below OPEC's minimum 
reference price of $18 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of seven crudes monitored by OPEC stood at $15.37 per 
42-gallon barrel last week. 
</P>
<P>
North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, fetched 
a spot price of $16.45 a barrel late Tuesday in London, unchanged from late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, 
settled at $18.81 a barrel Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The 
near-month contract traded at more than $24 in late January. 
</P>
<P>
Boussena said: "The single target is clear, how to eliminate the surpluses 
existing in the market in order to allow a price recovery. It is a single 
target, and I'm certainly hopeful we can achieve that target." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how much output needed to be cut, he responded: "It certainly is 
something between 1 (million) and 1 1/2 million barrels a day." When asked if 
such a cut would come from current production, he replied affirmatively.

Chevron to Sell Some Assets: Chevron U.S.A. Inc. said it has agreed to sell 
certain Gulf of Mexico oil reserves for about $150 million to a New 
Orleans-based partnership. Chevron U.S.A., the domestic oil and gas subsidiary 
of Chevron Corp., said it will sell its Main Pass 299 shallow oil reserves, 
estimated at 35 million to 50 million barrels of oil, to Freeport-McMoran 
Resource Partners Limited Partnership, an affiliate of Freeport-McMoran Inc., 
to avoid the costs and other problems tied to co-development of oil, gas and 
sulfur resources.

Bottled Water Sales Soar: Sales of bottled drinking water in the United States 
increased 400% during the 1980s, according to the International Bottled Water 
Assn. Consumer fears of pollution and dissatisfaction with the taste of tap 
waters promise continued sales growth of 20% a year, the association predicts.

From Nuclear to Gas: After years of costly delays, CMS Energy Corp. decided to 
switch its 85%-completed Midland, Mich., nuclear plant to natural gas, allowing 
it to recoup some of the $4.2 billion spent since groundbreaking in 1967. Three 
years ago, the company began raising $640 million for the conversion; now the 
plant generates enough electricity for a million people and is selling steam to 
a chemical plant. CMS Chairman William T. McCormick Jr. says $20 billion has 
been invested in abandoned nuclear power plants in the United States, all of 
which could be converted to gas. Toronto Globe and Mail

Future of Fuel Cells: After 32 years of research and testing, Westinghouse is 
beginning to introduce its fuel cell to electric utilities. The company's solid 
oxide fuel cell has already been sold for testing purposes to Japanese natural 
gas companies. Westinghouse soon will build a developmental manufacturing plant 
that will work out the production kinks. The new technology, which squeezes 
oxygen through chemicals and metals to produce electricity and heat, is 60% 
efficient, compared to 50% for gas turbines. However, producing the fuel cells 
at high volume and low cost has yet to be proven. The company expects to begin 
taking commercial orders for the cells in 1992. Pittsburgh Business Times

BAXTER DENIES IT SOLD PLANT TO GET OFF ARAB BLACKLIST

Hospital supply giant Baxter International Inc. on Tuesday denied it sold a 
plant in Israel to get off the Arab League's blacklist of companies doing 
business with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, the world's largest hospital supply company, has agreed to build a 
similar plant in Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Les Jacobson said Baxter learned indirectly of its removal from the 
list in January. 
</P>
<P>
He denied Baxter officials sought to curry favor with the Arabs by selling the 
plant in Israel, a move that would violate a U.S. law forbidding American 
companies from participating in foreign boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders are demanding an explanation from Baxter, which is based in 
Deerfield, Ill., north of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose from a memorandum about Baxter's Middle East operations 
purportedly on file in the Arab League's boycott office in the Syrian capital 
Damascus. The memo suggests the 1988 sale of the Israeli plant and the 
delisting were linked. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson questioned the authenticity of the memo, copies of which were sent to 
Baxter directors and to the Wall Street Journal by Richard Fuisz, a 
Washington-area businessman and former chief executive of Baxter's Middle 
Eastern Medcom subsidiary. 
</P>

Fuisz sued Baxter in 1985 on charges of wrongful termination and defamation 
after he was ousted from his job and demoted, Jacobson said. The lawsuit was 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
Fuisz could not be reached for comment. Telephone calls to his home in Great 
Falls, Va., went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson said company officials probably discussed with Syrian government 
officials their plans to sell the Israel plant, not as a condition of being 
dropped from the blacklist but rather in the context of negotiations that 
resulted in an agreement signed April 13 to jointly build a plant in Syria. 
</P>
<P>
The plant is slated to open late next year. Like the Israel plant, which was 
sold to the Israeli government, it will synthesize intravenous body fluids. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the U.S. Commerce Department nor the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, which are reviewing the company's Middle East activities, would 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The memo says Baxter sought removal from the blacklist through its Swiss 
subsidiary, Baxter AG. It also says another subsidiary, International Medical 
Technologies, documented the sale of the Israel plant and promised not to do 
any more business with Israel, Jacobson confirmed.

GROUP SEEKING PIC 'N' SAVE BID TRYING TO LURE INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The investment group that is attempting to take over Pic 'N' Save said Tuesday 
that it has started trying to lure investors to its side even as the 
Dominguez-based close-out retail chain evaluates ways to boost its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
Girard Partners, led by David H. Batchelder, former strategist for Texas 
corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr., previously has revealed plans to oust 
five members of the Pic 'N' Save board and install three of its own nominees, 
giving the group a majority. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which owns 6.6% of Pic 'N' Save, has said it would then sell part or 
all of the retailer to the partnership or another bidder. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last Saturday between the two camps, Pic 'N' Save said it is 
responding to the threat by "evaluating potential courses of action to enhance 
stockholder value," Girard Partners said in a filing Tuesday with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Girard representatives replied "that they 
believe that a sale of the company is the most desirable alternative," the 
filing stated. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pic 'N' Save refused to comment on the filing. No one from 
Girard Partners could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Girard Partners also said it has asked Pic 'N' Save for access to non-public 
financial and other information about the company and would agree to 
"appropriate confidentiality arrangements."

DOW CLIMBS 12 DESPITE HINT OF NEW INFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prices advanced on Wall Street Tuesday as the stock market shrugged off a 
purchasing managers report that indicated that a new round of inflation may be 
in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 12.16 to close at 2,668.92. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 820 up, 679 down and 467 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 149.02 million shares, up from 122.75 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened higher but began to lose ground after the National Assn. of 
Purchasing Management, which tracks the manufacturing economy by surveying its 
members each month, said its index rose to 50.2% in April from 48.8% in March. 
</P>
<P>
A reading above 50 generally indicates the economy is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers report reawakened concerns in the financial markets 
that a stronger economy would allow inflation to accelerate, and that the 
Federal Reserve would in turn push interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices, which had been up in early trading, surrendered their gains in 
response to the purchasing managers report, and the stock market initially 
followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
But while the credit markets went on to close lower, Wall Street took its own 
path, with blue chips first moving higher in the afternoon and secondary stocks 
catching on later. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's session repeated what has become a familiar stock market response to 
a negative report. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said traders realized that 
much of the bad news had already been discounted by the market. Once the 
initial shock wore off and prices did not drop further, buyers came back into 
the market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Security Pacific, which closed 
unchanged at 36. Both Security Pacific and the second-most active issue, Chase 
Manhattan, were involved in dividend-related trading. Chase was off 1/2 at 24 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
First-quarter earnings reports gave some stocks a boost. Chrysler rose 3/4 to 
15 1/4 after issuing a somewhat better-than-expected earnings report, and 
Boeing was up 2 1/2 to 72 1/4 after announcing Monday that its sales jumped 60% 
and its profits rose 87%. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsico fell 1/2 to 65 3/4 and Coca-Cola rose 1/2 to $76.75 after Burger King 
announced that it was switching to Coke from Pepsi in its U.S. fast-food 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, Tokyo stocks closed moderately higher. Trading was thin 
after a three-day weekend and ahead of market holidays in Tokyo on Thursday and 
Friday. The key 225-share Nikkei index closed up 105.03 points at 29,689.83. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices finished mostly higher, continuing a technical 
recovery. The Financial Times 100-share index finished up 14.5 points at 
2,117.9. 
</P>

<P>
Bond Prices Drop; Interest Rates Rise 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell, pushing a key long-term interest rate over 9% once again amid 
new signs of strength in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 3/16 point, or $1.88 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price declines, jumped to 
9.03% from 8.99% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices turned downward after the National Assn. of 
Purchasing Management reported that its index had risen in April. That was a 
healthy sign for the manufacturing sector but a source of anxiety about 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"That sent me back into my foxhole," said John Sebastian, an executive vice 
president at Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The growth in manufacturing was boosted by strength in new orders, particularly 
exports. Analysts also said the data indicated that inventories were lean and 
that manufacturers were hiring part-time workers in an effort to keep down 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
A healthy manufacturing sector is considered bad for the bond market because a 
growing economy usually means credit demand rises, pushing interest rates 
higher while depressing prices of fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
"All the news is showing increases in the manufacturing sector along with price 
pressures," said Elizabeth Reiners, a money-market economist with Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc. Inflation erodes the value of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Reiners also said a government report Tuesday that construction spending fell 
in March for the first time this year was not interpreted as a plus because 
good weather in January and February produced unseasonably large gains. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.125%, down from 8.188% late Monday.

Dollar Closes Mixed in Light Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended mixed Tuesday in light trading as many European markets were 
closed for the May Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Morrissey, a trader with Bank of Boston, said the dollar traded in a narrow 
range, with little news affecting the market. 
</P>
<P>
Many European markets were closed for May Day, and trading in the United States 
was thin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 158.90 Japanese yen from 159.08 yen on 
Friday. Japanese markets were closed Monday for a holiday. Later Tuesday, in 
London, the dollar fell to 158.80 yen. In New York, the dollar bought 158.85 
yen, down from 158.90 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $1.6385 to buy 
one pound, cheaper than $1.6390 late Monday. In New York, the dollar lost 
ground, with the pound trading at $1.6445, more expensive than $1.6405 late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Monday quotes, included: 
1.6805 West German marks, up from 1.6795; 1.4555 Swiss francs, up from 1.4530; 
5.6370 French francs, up from 5.6330; 1,231.75 Italian lire, up from 1,230.50, 
and 1.1646 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1644. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for May 
delivery settled at $370 an ounce, up $1.60 from late Monday. Republic National 
Bank of New York also quoted a late bid for gold at $370 an ounce, up $1.30.

Soybean Prices Fall in Sudden Reversal 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices fell moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade after a 
sudden reversal in a technically inspired rally that had driven prices to new 
nine-month highs. 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures followed the soybean market and ended mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, energy futures rose sharply; copper futures surged; 
precious metals advanced, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.

CHRYSLER NETS $71 MILLION IN QUARTER; COST CUTS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 U.S. auto maker, said Tuesday that cost cuts 
undertaken last year helped it make a $71-million profit in the first quarter 
of this year even though car sales plummetted. 
</P>
<P>
The results came as a pleasant surprise to Wall Street, where some industry 
analysts had expected the auto maker would barely break even or even post a 
small loss. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler stock closed up 75 cents at $15.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler posted a profit even as sales fell to $7.56 billion, compared to $9.66 
billion in the 1989 first quarter, when the auto maker had net earnings of $351 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems the cost-reduction program really is taking effect," said John 
Casesa, analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., who had expected Chrysler to 
report earnings of about 10 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
The company said earnings were hurt by high incentive costs and lower 
production volume. 
</P>
<P>
"We posted a profit in our automotive operations, despite lower volume and 
incentive costs nearly double what they were a year ago," Chairman and Chief 
Executive Lee A. Iacocca said in a statement. "Our $1.5-billion cost-cutting 
program is certain to become a major competitive advantage to Chrysler." 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Chrysler so far is saving $200 million per quarter 
through its cuts. The company last year established a target of cutting $1 
billion in annual costs this year and $1.5 billion annually when the program is 
fully implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that without the cost-cutting program, the quarter would likely 
have shown Chrysler deeply in the red. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that factory sales are down and incentives are up," said 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst Charles Brady. "There was no reason for good 
news." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in Chrysler's surprising showing was the improvement in its 
per-car profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts credited the increased profit margins to the company's decision to 
discontinue its Omni/Horizon line of subcompact cars in February of 1989 and 
higher sales of its lucrative minivans. 
</P>
<P>
"Chrysler is cutting down on the lower-priced vehicles, which means the average 
value of the cars is going up," said David Healy, analyst with Barclay's BZW. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also reduced its "fleet" sales, or discounted volume sales of 
vehicles to a single corporate customer. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said that in the first quarter, it sold 211,283 cars and 239,216 
trucks and minivans in the United States, giving the company a 9.2% share of 
the domestic car market and a 19.5% share of the domestic truck market. 
</P>
<P>
The company said first-quarter sales of its Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and 
Chrysler Town and Country model minivans were up 15% over the first quarter of 
1989. It said the popular minivans continue to command more than 50% of their 
market segments. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Financial Corp., the auto maker's finance arm, earned $89 million in 
the first quarter, up 37% from the $55 million earned in the first quarter of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the encouraging news from Chrysler, analysts do not have any plans to 
change their first-quarter estimates for Ford Motor Co. and General Motors 
Corp., which will report earnings later this week. 
</P>
<P>
They said the Chrysler improvement was due mostly to internal measures that 
helped offset negative industry factors such as lower production and rebate 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The profit figure from the first quarter of 1989 included a $13-million gain 
from discontinued operations.

MCI Communications Corp. on Tuesday announced the largest contract in its 
history, a $375-million pay-phone agreement with the Navy Resale and Services 
Support Office. 
</P>
<P>
The pact is also the biggest pay-phone contract awarded since U.S. District 
Judge Harold Greene's 1989 court order to open the pay-phone market to 
non-American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. carriers, said MCI President Bert C. 
Roberts Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy agreement will provide MCI with annual revenue of more than $75 
million, or a total of more than $375 million over five years, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
MCI will provide long-distance services to individuals making collect, 
third-party, person-to-person collect and calling card calls from pay phones 
located at Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard sites throughout the contiguous 
United States, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
MCI said it will serve as the prime supplier for NAVRESSO at the local and 
national level and will team with Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell as 
subcontractors to MCI. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will provide military personnel with calling cards.

GAMES: FOCUS ON NATURE; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYING GAMES WITH MOTHER NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The happiest adults," said Picasso, "are doing what they did as kids." 
</P>
<P>
And what do kids do? Play games. If one tableau for the Acquisitive '80s found 
them hunched over Monopoly or the Trump game or the Wall Street game or 
Acquire, a metaphor for the '90s may be a kinder, gentler competition across a 
game board that teaches environmental principals. 
</P>
<P>
The "environmental decade" is spawning an array of games, usually made from 
recycled or recyclable materials, that teach an appreciation of nature. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as Birding! -- developed by Robert Huffman, a copywriter for a 
Detroit publishing company -- are niche games, available only through 
conservation group catalogues or specialty shops. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by his twin interests in bird-watching and game-playing, Huffman, 33, 
spent four years creating his board game, which simulates a day of 
bird-watching in the marshes and wetland woods of Point Pelee National Park in 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"The pawns for my game are made out of wood, because I didn't want to use 
plastic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The game encourages people to stay on trails because groups have destroyed the 
vegetation. It doesn't just teach bird-watching, it also encourages ethical 
behavior that is in again. After the 'me' generation of the '80s, people are 
getting this feeling back." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman isn't sure how widespread this new selflessness is, but "green" games 
that teach people about recycling, geography, animals and plants are showing up 
across the boards. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a lot of new games that create involvement in nature," said 
Donna Baker Schwenk, a reviewer of educational materials for the National 
Wildlife Federation. Its new catalogue features Save the Forest, in which 
players follow a path through a forest, collecting litter, caring for animals 
and learning about their habitats. At the National Geographic Society, Barbara 
Fallon reports that the ongoing success of Global Pursuit -- in which players 
assemble pieces of a world map and answer trivia questions about the globe -- 
has spurred the development of On Assignment With National Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a family game, and you take on the role of a National Geographic 
photographer," she said. "It will be out next October for National Geographic 
members, or can be ordered. It won't be available through stores." 
</P>
<P>
But the games are also sprouting in stores outside the environmental niche. And 
while nobody is suggesting that Save the Forest will edge out Pictionary as the 
game of choice on a rainy afternoon, casual investigation reveals a coming 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trend, I'm telling you it's there," says Diana Huss Green, 
editor-in-chief of the quarterly magazine Parents' Choice. She shopped this 
year's mammoth New York Toy Fair, sponsored by the Toy Manufacturers of 
America, and came away with evidence that toy land is taking on an eco-tinge. 
Green ticked off some of the upcoming entries: 
</P>
<P>
* Pollution Solution, from Aristoplay, in which each player owns a section of 
the township and, confronted with a series of pollution problems, such as 
"overburdened septic tanks pollute lake and drinking wells," has to come up 
with solutions, such as "sanitary sewer system is installed." 
</P>
<P>
* Save the World, from Crown and Andrews, in which players guide endangered 
species across a world map and attempt to develop a better ecological balance. 
</P>
<P>
* Colorful Kingdom, from Family Games, for children, in which players try to 
match exotic animals with their desert, jungle or ocean habitat. 
</P>
<P>
* Endangered, from Family Games, for older children and adults, in which 
participants travel to various countries to help save endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't Bug Me, from Game Inventors of America, in which players race around 
the board, competing with other farmers to grow vegetables and ward off insects 
that threaten crops. 
</P>
<P>
Although the real evidence won't be in until Christmas, when 60% percent of 
toys and games are sold, Green gives the new games high marks for their fun 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
"They are competitive, and that's important. A game has to offer something to 
win, and it's just as much fun for kids if they win at solving pollution than 
at those horrible '80s games when the competition was to get the most money." 
</P>
<P>
She sees the whole board game category as reflective of society. 
</P>
<P>
"These games are telling me about values: that the most educated and affluent 
parents in history want to buy their children the tools of childhood that 
reflect their own values. 
</P>
<P>
"It speaks very well for environmental concern." 
</P>
<P>
At the Nature Company's 40 stores, environmental games such as Eco-lotto and 
Insect Dominos are becoming staples. "They're a trend which we think will only 
go up on the chart," says spokesman Michael Modzelewski. "We can barely keep 
them in the stores." 
</P>
<P>
Nature Company market research shows the typical customer to be a "slightly 
over-educated couple who are very interested in their children," Modzelewski 
said, "and games are important for setting values. I think they realize that 
even the mobile hanging over a crib or the animal painted on the wall are 
educational within themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"As we go toward the new millennium, the '90s are the decade of trying to save 
the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
But in the larger world of commerce, where companies generally acknowledge less 
lofty goals, "green" games are eyed with some skepticism. "A board game where 
everybody who cleans up the garbage wins, doesn't sound like much fun to me," 
suggested one industry expert. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Murray, the manager of Gamesmanship in South Coast Plaza, with 4,000 
square feet of nothing but board games, says he has not seen a trend yet: "To 
get something that gets big-big in this country, you have to have the big money 
-- get the major manufacturer behind it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And at the Toy Manufacturers of America, the industry trade association, Jodi 
Levin reported that "environmental games" do not warrant their own category in 
the $13.4-billion toy industry. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, trends like this sometimes start out very small in our 
industry and end up being huge," she added. "The trivia trend started that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Other observers recall a slew of wholesome "safety" games for children -- with 
titles such as Don't Talk to Strangers -- that were introduced a few years ago 
but never took off. "The play value wasn't there," says Mike Agrelius, director

"My attitude about this racial thing is this," says Yuri Hosoi Fairchild, at 
once feisty and honey-voiced: "When Johnny came marching home from the war, 
everybody was out of step but Johnny. I am Johnny. And I considered everybody 
else was wrong except me." 
</P>
<P>
The war was World War II. The place was Hawaii. Her family was "dead set" 
against her marrying a black man. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet he told you his father owns a plantation in California," they chided 
her, she recalls. "But when you get there, you'll find he has nothing. You'll 
be living on Central Avenue," then the social center of black Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
She looks at her husband as he sips a soda in the living room of their spacious 
home near Crenshaw Avenue and Venice Boulevard. The incessant buzz of a 
gardener mowing the front lawn rattles the air. 
</P>
<P>
"He hadn't told me anything like that, just that he had a postman's job. I just 
had faith in him, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Her family "eventually disowned me," she says. "They had me sign papers that 
said I had nothing coming from the family. So I said, 'Where's the pen?' I 
signed it and walked out." 
</P>
<P>
She could have been "devastated coming out here alone." But, says the woman 
with animated eyes and the gentle expression of a young girl, "I wasn't, 
because, as I told you, I was Johnny, the whole world was wrong. . . . Though 
no one supported me back home, black people have a big heart for all the strays 
that want to come in. So they accepted me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Fairchilds' youngest son, Halford, is a social psychologist by training and 
an expert in race relations. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the black community, in general, has been a lot more 
accepting of racial differences than other communities," he says. 
</P>
<P>
His assessment seems a combination of wishful thinking and fact. Recent 
conflicts between Korean immigrant merchants and African-American patrons in 
inner-city areas suggests that Korean-Americans in particular, and 
Asian-Americans in general, view blacks with unremitting hostility -- and that 
the feeling is mutual. 
</P>
<P>
But such sentiments often belie the complex interactions of those of Asian and 
African descent here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In spots such as Los Angeles' Crenshaw District, blacks and Japanese-Americans, 
in particular, have a long history of contact. Inevitably, their juxtaposed 
lives have led to decades of stories: the tenuous embrace of youths across 
ethnic lines, the bonds of lovers over generations. 
</P>
<P>
Further, new scholarly research undermines fixed views about the perpetual 
hostility between Asians and blacks. Their relationships and perceptions of 
each other have been a mixed bag over time and space, social scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Thornton, a University of Wisconsin sociologist, has engaged in 
pioneering research examining relationships between Asians and blacks and 
African-American perceptions of minority groups in the United States. In 1986, 
he began analyzing black perceptions of Asian-Americans recently and 
historically. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he says, blacks have felt a rapport with Asian-Americans "in terms 
of suffering racial discrimination, being denied access to the legal apparatus, 
and because of the kinds of discrimination Asians have faced" because of 
restrictive immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary attitudes differ, says the scholar, who was born in Kobe, Japan, 
to an African-American serviceman and a Japanese mother. 
</P>
<P>
Based on national data from the University of Michigan Institute for Social 
Research covering the late 1970s and early '80s, Thornton found that "blacks 
don't feel any specific rapport with Asian-American, generally. But there are 
specific groups of black Americans who feel very close to Asian-Americans," he 
says. "Black men, for some reason, feel closer to Asian-Americans than (black) 
women do. Don't know why. No one really has a handle on any of this stuff yet." 
</P>
<P>
Older black Americans also feel close to Asian-Americans, he says. "It may have 
something to do with the period in which they grew up," a time when there was 
widespread, institutionalized discrimination against all people of color. But 
"younger black Americans are more distant from that kind of era. Perhaps it is 
less clear to them why they should feel they have anything in common with 
Asians." 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Fairchild, 78, met Yuri Hosoi, 81, at a USO dance in Honolulu. It was 
April 28, 1943. Flipper Fairchild remembers. It's all in his diary. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just a sergeant on a fling," he says. "I didn't think anything in 
particular when I first saw her, I was just dancing." 
</P>
<P>
"Very insincere," his wife teases. But as soon as she saw him, "I was bowled 
over. He was very charming. I hadn't met anyone like him before," she says 
sweetly, breathlessly, as if 45 minutes, not 45 years, had passed since their 
wedding day. 
</P>
<P>
How soon after they met did they marry? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," answers Fairchild matter-of-factly, "I couldn't afford to ask her to 
marry me. I was already married." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have to tell all that?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's the truth," he says. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next? 
</P>
<P>
He shrugs. "I decided to let nature take its course." 
</P>
<P>
They had a daughter in 1943. "So I said, 'That's it.' " He divorced his wife in 
Tulsa, Okla., and brought his new bride and daughter back to the States in 
1946. Yuri Fairchild says she was cut off from all other Japanese-Americans, 
not just her family, when she moved to Los Angeles with her black husband. 
</P>
<P>
Says her son Halford: "The adult Japanese people tended to be very racist" when 
he was growing up in Los Angeles. "They would look down on my family for being 
racially mixed. It seems the antipathy toward black people is a worldwide 
phenomenon, and very strong in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
But Thornton, of the University of Wisconsin, says that before 1945, 
perceptions of people of African descent in Japan were mixed: "Most people had 
argued that the Japanese were inherently racist toward blacks. But the evidence 
I found indicated that there were a lot of Japanese who felt very positive 
about blacks, while others held very stereotypical points of views about black 
Americans. Now, the pattern after 1945 is intriguing." 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, Japanese perceptions of blacks "very much mirror those of 
Americans," explains Thornton, a professor in Wisconsin's Afro-American Studies 
Department and a member of the advisory committee for the Asian-American 
studies program now being established there. 
</P>
<P>
"After 1945, the U.S. came in and basically took over the educational system 
and revamped Japanese society," he says. In doing so, the Americans also 
"brought in a lot of their stereotypical views about black Americans and 
Africans." 
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of a Japanese-American who grew up in the Crenshaw -- 
"where Queen Bee Soul Food stood right next to Yoko's Sushi" -- there was much 
cultural schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the tug of so many cultures," says Ed Iwata, 32. "At home we got the 
Buddhist and Confucian influence of our parents. In the larger society, the 
overpowering white influence. And out on the streets of the neighborhood, we 
got the African-American culture staring us in the face. I think a lot of us 
Japanese-Americans grew up schizophrenic." 
</P>
<P>
Then and now, Iwata laments, ignorance bred much "mistrust and hatred" between 
blacks and Asians. But there were always exceptions: a Yuri and Flipper 
Fairchild, Iwata in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
"My best friend growing up through grade school and junior high was a black guy 
named Harry Price -- I'd love to hook up with him again," Iwata says. 
</P>
<P>
He and Harry rode bikes together, played "basketball to all hours of the 
night," says Iwata, a free-lance writer based in San Francisco. He shakes his 
head and gives out a nostalgic chuckle worthy of "The Wonder Years": "We 
discovered Playboy together in his father's bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
Back then, circa 1969, the Crenshaw District -- the area roughly a few blocks 
east and west of Crenshaw Boulevard between Pico Boulevard and Florence Avenue 
-- was undergoing yet another ethnic transformation. After World War II, whites 
began to leave the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
From the 1950s to the 1960s, the area was the center of the Japanese-American 
community, says sociologist Harry Kitano, professor of Asian-American studies 
at UCLA. Japanese-Americans had moved west to Crenshaw from the Little Tokyo 
area and East Los Angeles. By the 1970s, they moved to Palos Verdes and 
Gardena. Though the Crenshaw is predominantly African-American now, "remnants 
of older, second-generation Japanese-Americans still live there." 
</P>
<P>
Iwata and his young friend parted company in the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"Our grade school was mostly Japanese-American, Coliseum Elementary," he says. 
But their junior high school, Audubon on Santa Barbara, now Martin Luther King 
Jr. Boulevard, was mostly black. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese-Americans," he says, "came under a lot of attack. A lot of us got 
beat up a lot of the time. And poor Harry, because he hung out with us, was 
attacked several times. His parents finally transferred him to another junior 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
Iwata's parents, who still live in the Crenshaw District, never knew of his 
beatings: "I never told them. It was very frustrating for Asian kids because we 
rarely tell our problems to our parents. Speaking out loud, communicating in a 
frank manner is unusual and uncomfortable for us, even for third-generation 
Asian-American kids." 
</P>
<P>
Even when his mother picked him up after school one day and found him bloodied, 
tears streaming down his face, she said nothing: "Her glance indicated that I 
was up to no good and she didn't approve. She just assumed I'd been in a fight 
and goofing up. She thought I was a rowdy kid because I hung around with this 
black guy." 
</P>
<P>
He had, in fact, been attacked by black street gang members who had designated 
the last day of each semester as "kill Buddha day. Seems funny now," he says, 
"it was terrifying then." 
</P>
<P>
Yuri and Flipper Fairchild's Afro-Asian children caught hell from all sides. 
The memories are so painful for the two eldest children, they decided not to 
speak on the record for this story. 
</P>
<P>
But Flipper Fairchild recalls their childhood differently. 
</P>
<P>
When they were teen-agers, "the children said they'd been ostracized" because 
of their background, he says, a bemused look playing across his face. 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally unaware of such a thing," he says, his head slightly bent and 
moving side-to-side in a motion of disbelief. "We went to Bethel AME church. 
The children were part of the Sunday school, part of the junior choir. I never 
thought they were ostracized. . . . I was shocked when my daughter, as a 
teen-ager, said the colored girls didn't like her, which I think was more of 
her imagination than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
His wife interrupts: "No, it's true, they called her half-breed. . . . She felt 
very ostracized." 
</P>
<P>
In general, people who marry interracially "are not aware of the dilemmas the 
children face. In many cases, they are not denying the fact that these children 
may have these problematic experiences. They just don't have the background to 
understand," says Thornton, who describes himself as BJA, black 
Japanese-American. 
</P>
<P>
Halford, 41, says his identity and rejection by his peers was "quite a bit of 
an issue" early in his life: "In the junior high school years, people are at 
the height of their unfriendliness toward each other. Kids talk about people 
being fat or skinny, light or dark. My own racial background and physiognomy 
made me the target of that kind of adolescent chiding and abuse. I think I was 
scarred by some of that for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
But by high school, things had changed. The time and the school had much to do 
with it, says the scholar, a former president of the National Assn. of Black 
Psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1967, when blacks, Latinos, Asian- 
and Euro-Americans each made up about 25% of the school. The '60s liberal 
social attitudes contributed to the school's interethnic harmony, he suggests: 
"It was a unique time. . . . Everyone seemed color-blind. I think about the 
parties we had . . . lavish parties in Hollywood, Venice, Hancock Park . . . in 
the homes of millionaires, usually whites. But the . . . cultural style that 
predominated among the Latinos, Asians and whites, was black. They were all hip 
in the black style." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that time, he says, "what really tears at my heart is the 
black-Korean interaction in this community, which is not good. It might be that 
the Koreans are first generation and the language difference and cultural 
differences are very pronounced. When I was coming up, most of the Japanese 
kids and Hispanic kids were all second generation, all native English speakers. 
That made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
The belief that cultural differences are at the root of the conflict between 
blacks (who claim they are exploited by Korean merchants who take their money 
and treat them with racist contempt) and Korean immigrant shopkeepers (who see 
blacks as criminals, unemployed loafers and welfare queens) is common. It is 
used to explain tensions between Asian-and African-Americans generally. 
</P>
<P>
But those who make the argument don't see the socioeconomic forest for the 
trees, says Ronald Takaki. The UC Berkeley professor, noted historian and 
author of "Strangers From a Different Shore, A History of Asian Americans," 
says frictions are caused by economic, not cultural, factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Koreans have a class edge. . . . I looked at a study of Korean green grocers 
in New York City and found that 78% came here with college degrees," a big 
class difference between them and most blacks they serve. But it's not 
education alone that helps them succeed, he adds. "They also bring money. . . . 
Many come with $50,000 to $80,000 in cash." 
</P>
<P>
Their success fuels resentment among blacks who can't get loans to start 
businesses, and among the growing black underclass created by the loss of 
manufacturing jobs in America -- historically, the major sector of the economy 
that employed blacks, explains Takaki. 
</P>
<P>
"Asian-Americans, as a model minority" -- he says the phrase with disdain -- 
"have been pitted against blacks as an underclass." 
</P>
<P>
Why? Takaki asks. 
</P>
<P>
"It has very little to do with Asian-Americans and blacks. I think there is a 
nervousness in middle-class white society about its own place and its own 
future. They feel threatened by Asian-Americans. We represent the fastest 
growing ethnic group in society." 
</P>
<P>
But the white middle class also views as "very threatening the rising 
underclass of blacks. (They) feel very vulnerable in public places -- streets, 
subways -- and don't know what to do with this black underclass. . . . They are 
worried that this group may not have a future in America." So they make 
Asian-Americans a "model" minority. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a way of disciplining this black underclass, a way to say, 'Hey, 
they too have been victims of discrimination. But they made it by pulling 
themselves up by their bootstraps, thrift, hard work, emphasis on family 
values.' " 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing wrong with black family values, says Takaki, who taught the 
first black history courses at UCLA and established the Ethnic Studies Centers. 
Those in the underclass want the same quality of life as middle-class 
Americans, but "changes in the American economy (since the '60s) have caused 
the disintegration of the black family," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Where blacks with little formal education could once earn $15 an hour working 
in a factory, they are now locked into the service sector, says Takaki. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about McDonald's, the hotel and restaurant business, where they 
earn the minimum wage. These are not wages that will enable blacks to support a 
family. This has nothing to do with their cultural values." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, African- and Asian-Americans -- who Takaki notes have worked together 
in such varied spots as plantations in Hawaii, Louisiana and Mississippi -- 
have similar values, says Thornton: "A collective identification with other 
members of their own group" is important to both. Part of that may stem from 
their minority status. But generally, it contrasts with the Western as opposed 
to non-Western ways of looking at the world. It's the West's individualism, 
versus the family orientation of those of Asian and African descent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite real and perceived differences among the groups, the record reveals 
that the experience of much of the Asian and African diaspora in the New World 
is embraced by a historical arc filled with parallels. 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, both groups have experienced what could be called unfree 
labor," says Takaki. "Blacks came here as slaves. Asians, for the most part, 
came here as free laborers, wage earners." 
</P>
<P>
But slavery is not the basis for a comparison between Asian- and 
African-American labor; it is, rather, the life of the black sharecropper and 
contract laborers on the Hawaiian sugar plantations. 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Fairchild's mother suffered the neo-slavery of the post-Reconstruction 
era in Arkansas; Yuri Hosoi Fairchild's mother was whipped while working cane 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls: "When I was about 1, (Mother worked on) one of those slave-like 
plantations in Arkansas, sharecropping with my father. A very cruel white man 
was taking advantage of us. She and my father knew they had to get out of that 
place." They fled to Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Fairchild nods silently. Her mother left Japan to be a contract laborer in 
Hawaii, where dozens of laborers on a sugar plantation lived in a "one-room 
cottage in the fields with no running water," she says. They had to build fires 
outdoors to cook and generally "were treated like cattle." 
</P>
<P>
Like the allegedly lazy black slave who saw no benefit in working hard for 
nothing but a whipping, her mother pretended "she had a headache and would not 
work. They got a horsewhip and beat her." 
</P>
<P>
Says Yuri Fairchild: "My mother had spirit, like me. She said, 'I'm not putting 
up with this nonsense.' When she found her opportunity, she escaped." 
</P>
<P>
That path led her to work in the kitchen of a white woman. "There was my 
father, working as a cook in the kitchen. They got married." 
</P>
<P>
The couple opened the Hosoi Funeral Home and grew wealthy. "Anybody who comes 
from Hawaii, they know the name Hosoi," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Flipper and Yuri Fairchild also have done well in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, they moved into their first house on 37th Drive and Normandie Avenue. 
The neighborhood was "partly white, partly mixed," recalls Yuri Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
With their savings, they bought their house on 37th Drive for $10,500. Later, 
they purchased the house next door. The owner wanted $12,000. Yuri Fairchild 
told her husband to offer $8,000. Surprisingly, the owner -- a white woman 
alarmed at the number of blacks moving into the area -- sold it for that price. 
They paid her in a few years, moved into a mansion in Los Angeles' Berkeley 
Square for $21,500, sold it for $46,000 in 1961 when the Santa Monica Freeway 
came, then moved into their present home, a rambling, Craftsman-style house. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Fairchild says with a nod, "Yes, it's true," their net worth is more than 
seven figures -- not from their Los Angeles property only. 
</P>
<P>
Her brother, a wealthy Honolulu physician, realized his sister had made a good 
marriage. Their emotional cold war thawed in 1970 when they met at a party 
thrown by a relative too young to know that Yuri had been cast from the family 
decades before. Five years later, as Yuri's brother lay dying, Flipper 
Fairchild rushed to Honolulu at the Hosoi family's request to help care for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The brother left everything he owned -- including a palatial mansion and a vast 
collection of Asian art -- to his outcast sister. Eventually, she sold the 
mansion to a Korean businessman and had an auctioneer handle the art. 
</P>
<P>
Have the Hosoi clan forgiven her? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I want to forgive them," she says. But, yes, they've reunited. 
"Who would want to kick out a wealthy heiress? " she asks, then cackles long 
and hard.

ALL ABOARD: Anaheim's Snow House Moving Co. -- as its name indicates -- usually 
moves houses and usually rolls them through the streets. . . . But next week 
the company will move a 5,000-square-foot office building by water. . . . 
Because the one-story, modular structure, now being used by the L.A. Harbor 
Department in San Pedro, is too wide to move through the streets, it will be 
dollied to wharfside and hoisted onto a barge for a 1.5-mile trip to another 
waterfront site. Barbie Ludovise and Lanie Jones

FULLERTON ASKS RESIDENTS TO CONSERVE WATER SUPPLY; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: THE CALL FOR LESS CONSUMPTION IS PART OF A GROWING PUSH BY POLITICAL 
SUBDIVISIONS TO TRIM USAGE LEST MANDATORY CUTS BE REQUIRED.

<P>
Fullerton on Tuesday became one of a growing number of Orange County cities to 
ask its residents to reduce their water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council called on residents to cut water use by 10%, and city 
officials warned that mandatory water reductions and fines for people who waste 
water could be imposed this summer if voluntary measures are not successful. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's action came the same day Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder announced that she intends to propose a county ordinance requiring 
developers to comply with water conservation guidelines in order to receive a 
building permit. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, the board's most outspoken advocate of water conservation, said the 
ordinance would help the county grapple with increasingly dire water shortages. 
The guidelines are being developed by a Water Conservation Task Force, which 
expects to make its report in June. 
</P>
<P>
Most cities and water districts in Orange County are considering some type of 
water conservation plan in an attempt to battle worsening drought conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the South Coast Water District called on Laguna Beach and Dana Point 
residents to cut water use by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach City Council is scheduled to vote on an ordinance May 14 that 
would require a 50% surcharge for water used for residential and commercial 
construction and a 10% surcharge for residential consumption of more than 1,000 
cubic feet per month. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente, which faced a water shortage last summer, has in place the 
county's strictest water restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the city imposed a 90-day freeze on new construction in an effort 
to conserve water. A month later, the City Council gave city staff the power to 
cut off service to irrigation systems that use too much water during a water 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's proposed ordinance could make building permits dependent on approval 
of a "water management plan" for any proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
Some area developers already have expressed concern about the proposed water 
management requirement, saying it could increase the cost of housing by adding 
another layer of bureaucracy to the planning and development process. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she hopes that the building community will ultimately support her 
ordinance. The legislation, she added, would help the county achieve its goal 
of cutting water usage by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she intends to draft an ordinance after she receives the work of 
the task force. An ordinance would probably be ready for the supervisors to 
consider in July, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's water problems are less severe than the shortages faced in 
other parts of the state because of a massive underground lake containing 
millions of gallons of water accumulated through centuries of percolation from 
the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
The lake contains several years' supply of water for the county, but only a 
certain amount per year can be drawn off lest seawater mingle with the lake, 
making it saline. 
</P>
<P>
Because the lake is beneath only the northern and central portion of the 
county, South County residents have no access to it.

DISCIPLINE: KICKED OUT OF TUSTIN UNIFIED'S FOOTHILL HIGH, HE CAN'T ENTER A NEW

Last week, Edmund Cronin was kicked out of Foothill High School in the Tustin 
Unified School District after he helped organize a student protest against a 
decision by some teachers to boycott homework assignments. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the Santa Ana teen-ager is trying to enroll at another school. But 
because at least one of Cronin's teachers believes that he was treated unfairly 
at Foothill, the instructor has refused to sign withdrawal papers, delaying 
Cronin's registration at Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Frogue, Cronin's history teacher, said he will not sign the papers 
because the principal made Cronin the scapegoat of a demonstration in which 
more than 1,000 students participated. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Cronin went to Santa Ana High School to enroll on Tuesday but was 
rejected. His father, Alan Cronin, said he will accompany his son today in an 
effort to get things straightened out. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't enroll him without his transcripts and his files and everything, 
which the teachers won't sign," Alan Cronin said. "We're still trying to get 
the paper work squared away." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Huston, assistant principal at Santa Ana High School, said he could not 
comment on the matter. "All of this information about students is classified," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cronin's interdistrict transfer to Foothill was revoked last Thursday after he 
participated in a student sit-in on Wednesday. Cronin and several other juniors 
organized the demonstration because they said their teachers' decision to stop 
assigning homework in protest of stalled contract negotiations is hurting their 
education. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, two days after the demonstration, Assistant Principal Pete Yoder 
asked Cronin to clear out his locker and escorted him to the edge of the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until Monday night that the family learned the official reason 
for the disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
In a closed meeting following a school board meeting, district administrators 
told the family that Cronin was kicked out because he was a discipline problem. 
They cited an argument with Principal James Ryan during the demonstration, as 
well as previous incidents of tardiness, leaving campus at lunch and talking 
back to teachers. Cronin maintains that he did not argue with the principal but 
that he told him the students had a legal right to gather peaceably. 
</P>
<P>
Though Alan Cronin and his wife, Ann, asked the school board to let their son 
continue at Foothill, Supt. Maurice A. Ross told them Tuesday that the board 
had sided with Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said interdistrict transfers can be revoked if a student's scholarship or 
citizenship are not up to par. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to accommodate the needs of the youngsters, but, of course, it's on a 
privileged basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cronin transferred to Foothill High School in his sophomore year because many 
of his friends attend the school. 
</P>
<P>
The board also discussed the punishment of 110 other students, Ross said. The 
principal's decision to place the students on probation and put notices about 
the demonstration in their disciplinary files came under fire at the board 
meeting Monday night. A man whose granddaughter received a notice said it would 
hurt the students for the rest of their lives, making it more difficult for 
them to get jobs or be accepted at colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The board decided to send letters to parents explaining that material in 
disciplinary files does not go to colleges or employers. And if there are no 
further incidents before the end of the school year, the notices will be taken 
out of the files and the students will be taken off probation, Ross said.

OTHER CITY WORKERS USED SHERIDAN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan's real estate firm has represented as 
many as 19 city employees in private land transactions since 1984, her husband 
and business partner said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan's role in representing City Atty. Roger Grable in the sale of his home 
earlier this year triggered an ongoing city inquiry into the practice, which 
was criticized by Councilman Edward A. Dornan as a potential conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a city official also revealed that the inquiry has been expanded 
beyond the Grable transaction to include all business that the Sheridan 
partnership did with municipal employees. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Paul Brady Jr. confirmed that the inquiry, being conducted by a 
San Francisco expert in legal conflicts, has been widened to include all city 
employees at the request of the council. Brady declined comment on the inquiry, 
saying it is scheduled for discussion at a closed session of the council 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan's husband, Donald Sheridan, a broker at ReMax Realty in Irvine, said 
Tuesday that he believes his wife did nothing wrong in her business dealings 
with city employees. He said no more than 20 such transactions occurred in the 
last seven years, and together represented no more than 10% of the Sheridan 
partnership's business. The Sheridans were commonly the listing agents for 
property sales in these transactions, Donald Sheridan said, which entitled them 
to a small percentage of the sale price. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Sheridan also offered to provide detailed information on each 
transaction to the council, through his personal accountant. He declined to 
identify publicly the city employees he and his wife have represented. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan said he said his wife have disclosed all financial information 
required by law, and challenged other council members to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider (the inquiry) a persecution of my wife," he said. "Enough is 
enough. I think we should all be on a level playing field and open all of our 
books." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Anne Sheridan, a candidate for mayor against popular incumbent Larry 
Agran in next month's election, could not be reached for comment and did not 
participate in Tuesday's news conference at the couple's real estate office. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, who first questioned Sheridan's transaction, on Tuesday called the 
press conference "a desperate attempt to camouflage the issue of (Donald 
Sheridan's) representation of city employees." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he will seek to require that all city employees report any business 
transactions with any council member. 
</P>
<P>
"This way, it's right up front and it doesn't prevent people from doing 
anything if it isn't illegal," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Brady has acknowledged selling at least two houses through the 
Sheridans while he served as assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Grable also confirmed that his home was listed by Donald Sheridan in 
a transaction completed on April 13. Last December, Sally Anne Sheridan voted 
to renew a city contract with Grable's law firm, Rutan &amp; Tucker. Grable 
said he is familiar with conflict laws and can see no violations. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Anne Sheridan abstained last week from voting on a matter involving Rutan 
&amp; Tucker. Donald Sheridan said Tuesday that his wife is not allowed under 
state law to vote on any such matter for one year after the sale of Grable's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan said he and his wife plan to continue representing city employees in 
real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should be able to do business with anybody we want to," Donald 
Sheridan said. "Why should we be restricted just because Sally is an elected 
official? We've got to make a living." WENDY PAULSON

CUTBACKS AFFECT NEEDY CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of needy Orange County infants may be deprived of nutritional 
assistance as a result of cutbacks in a county-administered food program, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Program directors on Monday began turning away hundreds of babies of low-income 
families -- including those babies judged at medical risk -- who might 
otherwise have been eligible for the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental 
Food Program. Known as WIC, the 16-year-old, federally funded program provides 
food and educational assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Infants already enrolled in the program will be able to get assistance until 
their first birthday, said Michelle van Eyken, program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Van Eyken said the cutbacks were made because funding has not kept pace with 
the steep increase in the number of women and children using the program. 
</P>
<P>
The WIC program, administered by the County Health Care Agency, is contracted 
to serve 15,500 participants a month. However, caseloads have averaged 
significantly more than that, Van Eyken said. Last month more than 15,800 
participants were enrolled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of low-income people in Orange County and the numbers are 
going up, not down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the state Department of Health Services, which disperses federal 
funds for the program, told Orange County officials they would have to reduce 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's cutback was only the latest in a series of restrictions in the program 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Under WIC guidelines, eligibility extends to all low-income women who are 
pregnant, breast feeding or who have delivered within the last three months. 
Children under 5 who are undernourished are also eligible. However, in Orange 
County, postpartum women who are not breast feeding became ineligible last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the county stopped serving all children. Only medically at-risk 
pregnant women will now be allowed to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
Social welfare officials said the cutbacks could have a dramatic impact on the 
health of poor families which already have limited health and food options. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a statewide funding shortfall in the WIC program prompted a 
meeting among state officials Tuesday to consider possible alternative sources 
of funding to prevent further cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which provides the funding, 
said a higher-than-expected inflation rate for food prices in California, 
combined with increased participation in the program statewide, contributed to 
a shortfall of $14.5 million for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at our options right now, trying to determine if we can 
readjust some other funding mechanism," said state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), who in February -- before the current funding crisis -- 
introduced a bill that would supplement the WIC program with $4 million in 
state money. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, SB 2038, passed the Senate's Health and Human Services Committee last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
WIC is one of the few social welfare programs proven to be cost effective, 
Bergeson noted, citing a Harvard University study that found that every dollar 
spent in the program means a savings of $3 in future health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why the cuts in Orange County are drastic and will have a severe 
effect, especially on children," Bergeson said. CARLA RIVERA

UFW FOUNDER ASKS UCI TO JOIN BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Farm Workers founder Cesar Chavez received a standing ovation from more 
than 430 people who packed a UC Irvine auditorium Tuesday to hear him ask for 
support of the 4-year-old boycott of table grapes. The grapes boycott -- the 
third organized by UFW since it was founded 28 years ago -- is aimed at forcing 
growers to stop using pesticides, which Chavez and other union members blame 
for an alarming increase of cancer among farm workers in the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The East Los Angeles-based roots-rock band Los Lobos made a surprise appearance 
to show its support for the boycott and for Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez is encouraging students at 11 Southern California campuses this week to 
fast for one day in observance of his cause.

COUNCIL APPROVES 5-YEAR HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a state-mandated local housing 
plan that spells out the city's strategy for dealing with housing needs in the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for building 1,823 new dwelling units by 1995, with about 
one-third of those for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
The city also promised to continue its mobile home rent-control program and 
issue loans for home rehabilitation in the Los Rios area. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members noted that severe cuts in federal housing programs, a lack 
of land for development and high property costs made it difficult to meet some 
of the state's requirements regarding affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The housing plan is an element of the city's General Plan, the blueprint for 
local residential and commercial development. The plan must be revised every 
five years and submitted to the state for approval.LAURA MICHAELIS

PARENTS FIGHT NEW SCHOOL BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan that would change the boundaries of three elementary schools in the 
Westminster School District to balance enrollments at each campus will be the 
topic of a public hearing May 17. 
</P>
<P>
The three schools are Iva Meairs, Midway City and H.B. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Student populations at Meairs and Midway City are both overcrowded, while 
Anderson is about 100 students below capacity, said Supt. Keith W. Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Gilmore, principal at Meairs, said her school has added portable 
classrooms but is still overcrowded by about 50 to 60 students. Midway City 
Elementary is overcrowded by about 25 students, Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson Principal John Sessums said his school would welcome more students and 
told parents at a hearing last week about the school's programs. 
</P>
<P>
But at a public hearing last week, parents opposed the boundary changes because 
they would require children to walk further and force them to cross the busy 
intersection at Westminster Boulevard and Newland Street. 
</P>
<P>
The board reached an informal consensus that the school boundaries would not be 
altered without busing the students.

PSEUDO FIRM GIVES STUDENTS REAL SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a typical Monday morning at Universal Insurance. Office manager Adam 
Chavez is fiddling with the copy machine, policy writer Martha Huizar is typing 
up forms and agents are busy in their cubicles with paper work and telephone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a catch to this picture of life in the office: It's all pretend. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, Huizar and the busy agents are really students at Santa Ana High School 
who are running a simulated insurance company through a program called Project 
InVEST, sponsored by the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers Assn. of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The program, now in its second year, is the only one of its kind in Orange 
County. School officials say Project InVEST has been instrumental in helping to 
guide students toward careers in business. 
</P>
<P>
"A good portion of the students now see their futures in a different light, in 
terms of opportunity," said teacher JoAnna Aguirre. "This class is not just 
about what the insurance business can do for them, but it shows them that they 
can do anything they want. They are more aware that they can have a piece of 
the pie." 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said she was attracted to the program by the doors it could open for 
Santa Ana High students, 80% of whom are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't that many Latinos in the business world," Aguirre said. "I 
realized that this could be a good vehicle to attract more students into 
business who, historically, wouldn't be interested." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to learning the ins and outs of the insurance business by 
practicing selling policies to their family and friends, the students have gone 
on field trips to local insurance companies and listened to guest speakers. 
</P>
<P>
A regular speaker is Donna Ferguson, president of Ferguson Insurance. She was 
president of the brokers association two years ago when it was looking for a 
school in Orange County at which to begin the program. The association pays for 
desks, typewriters and other office equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been looking for a suitable school for years," Ferguson said. "Santa 
Ana High School seemed perfect for what we wanted to do because of its Hispanic 
population and we felt this was a place where it could really help. The 
students benefit because they are being trained to go out into the world and we 
benefit because we can hire many of these students. They have young minds and 
are easy to teach." 
</P>
<P>
Although not all of the 65 students enrolled in the program plan to go into the 
insurance business, a job is waiting for them if they do. Those who complete 
the course are guaranteed at least an entry-level job in the insurance field. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Carlos Torres, 18, said he took the class to learn more about his own 
auto insurance but has ended up planning on a career in the business, possibly 
as a policy underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all pretend, but it's very real because you deal with everything that's 
used in the industry," Torres said. "It's different from other classes. We're 
treated like adults and we're in a business environment. You learn other trades 
like banking, accounting and computers." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Fransica Alvarado took the course and has decided to become an insurance 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped that this class would lead me to a better career and it has," 
Alvarado said. "It's given me an idea of what I really want to do down the 
line. I feel like this is my big chance in life." GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
PARKS GROUP CLAIMS SUCCESS ON INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An environmental organization claimed success Tuesday in an initiative drive to 
prohibit the city from selling or leasing public land unless voters agree. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, spokeswoman for Save Our Parks, said the initiative, if passed by 
voters on Nov. 6, would block city plans to lease beach-bluff land for the 
proposed Pierside Village restaurant project. 
</P>
<P>
Cook claimed that the group has gathered 16,500 signatures on initiative 
petitions, enough to require an election. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found out from talking to voters, as we gathered these signatures, that 
they're disgusted with the City Council majority and that they think developers 
have too much influence in this city," said Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays called the Save Our Parks initiative a needless 
circumvention of representative democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"A City Council is elected to make these kinds of day-to-day decisions," Mays 
said. "I think people get tired of decision-making by the ballot box. I think 
people also are tired of the abuse of the initiative process." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Mays, Councilwoman Grace Winchell on Tuesday praised the 
initiative and said she hopes city voters will approve it in November. "I think 
(the initiative) is a rational approach," she said. "I think people of the city 
want to make sure that a council, be it this one or one in the future, doesn't 
lease or sell off parkland in an offhanded way or in time of a financial crunch 
without bringing the issue to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We are elected to the City Council by the people, it is true, but I think 
issues involving the parks and beaches are so near and dear to the people that 
they want double protection, and this (initiative) will provide that." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said Mays and the City Council majority have not heeded the environmental 
concerns of many residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Our Parks initiative, an amendment to the City Charter, reads: "Any 
sale, lease or other disposition of park or beach lands would be subject to the 
prior affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the City Council and of 
the electors voting thereon at an election mandated by the measure. Such 
approval is also required prior to construction of any road, golf course, 
driving range, building larger than 3,000 square feet in floor area or of any 
structure costing more than $100,000 within any city-owned or operated park or 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative was launched last fall after some residents opposed a council 
proposal to lease an undeveloped portion of Central Park to a commercial firm 
to build a golf course. Residents opposed to the golf course formed Save Our 
Parks and spearheaded the effort to gather the 15,302 signatures of registered 
voters necessary to put an initiative on the ballot. If it passes, the 
initiative would also require a vote on the golf course proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said that as of Tuesday, Save Our Parks had gathered 16,500 voter 
signatures. The petitions will be turned in next month. The drive seeks to 
gather 18,000 signatures to provide a cushion when signatures on the petitions 
are verified, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said she is convinced that "99% of the voters are opposed to the city's 
trying to lease or sell off our parks and beaches." She added that she is 
confident that voters will approve the initiative and block any city proposals 
for development of beach or parkland. BILL BILLITER

SCHOOLS RAISE GRADE LIMIT FOR EXTRA ACTIVITIES

After several weeks of study, the Irvine Unified School District Board of 
Trustees voted unanimously Tuesday to increase the minimum requirements to 
participate in most extracurricular activities. Sports are excepted. 
</P>
<P>
Any high school student who fails a class or does not maintain a 2.5 (C+) 
grade-point average will not be allowed to take part in such activities as 
cheerleading and student government. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy will apply to the 5,850 students who attend the district's three 
high schools. Previously, each high school was allowed to develop its own 
standards for participation in extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
The new district policy was prompted by a Woodbridge High School cheerleader 
who complained that she and other pep squad members were discriminated against 
since they were the only ones to whom the "no F" rule applied. Other students 
holding positions of responsibility, including student body officers, student 
council members and athletes, were allowed to fail a class and still 
participate in extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
The school board directed the district staff to divide extracurricular 
activities into two categories based on the time commitment required. 
</P>
<P>
Cheerleaders, other pep squad members and student body officers were placed in 
the year-round category. Those students will be held to the higher standards. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes and students participating in the performing arts were placed into a 
partial-year category. They must only maintain a 2.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the mother of the cheerleader who originally complained 
said she would file suit charging the school district with discrimination. 
"Clearly there is a bias on the part of athletics," said Patricia Passy.

The Atlanta Braves put first baseman Nick Esasky on the 15-day disabled list 
because of vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
The move was retroactive to April 22, one day after Esasky was sidelined with 
an injured right shoulder. He will be eligible to rejoin the roster next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Persons with vertigo experience dizziness and the sensation in which all things 
seem to be swirling. Esasky had a .171 average in nine games this year.

TENNIS; 
</P>

SHE WAS THE PERFECT COMPLEMENT

Bud Collins wears Technicolor pants. They are an explosion of red and orange 
and green and, wearing them, Collins looks as though somebody just grabbed him 
by the arms and dipped him in some pools of paint. He doesn't wear them all the 
time, of course, but often enough to make his point. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he is writing about tennis, as Collins does for the Boston Globe, or 
talking about it, as he does for NBC-TV, he believes that tennis ought to be 
just as much fun and as unpredictable and colorful as he is. With his long gray 
beard and gleaming bald head, Collins has successfully cast himself as a sort 
of tennis Puck, never short of a quip or a line. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Mary Lou Collins was the perfect counterbalance to her husband. If 
Collins was zany and loud, Mary Lou was quiet and reserved. 
</P>
<P>
On a warm June afternoon last year just before Wimbledon, Collins and Mary Lou 
and some friends spent the day in Cambridge, England. They watched the boats on 
Cam River, had afternoon tea and then decided to play croquet. Collins must 
have felt displaced in such a serene setting, for right in the middle of the 
game, he suddenly grew animated. 
</P>
<P>
He became very competitive. He and Mary Lou were on the same team and they were 
losing. Red in the face, he began yelling at Mary Lou, who turned to him and 
replied, in her most dignified manner: "I'll do it my way, thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Friends also relished telling of the time Mary Lou, Collins and friends had 
dined at an Italian restaurant on the upper East Side in New York when Bud was 
there covering the U.S. Open. Mary Lou ordered grappa, a sweet but potent 
brandy, and seemed to be enjoying herself more than usual after several 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
They were married six years ago, when Collins returned to Berea, Ohio, to 
receive an award from Baldwin-Wallace, his alma mater. Redheaded Mary Lou, who 
had been Collins' high school sweetheart, was a widow when Collins came back 
into her life again. At the time, Collins was grieving the loss of his closest 
companion, Judy Lacey, who had died of a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Together at last, Collins and Mary Lou became inseparable. She went with him 
wherever Collins' job took him. Then, she began complaining of headaches. 
Doctors found a tumor in her brain Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou went into the hospital for surgery Jan. 5. Friends sent her grappa. 
She told them she would get well and Collins took her to Toronto, where she had 
experimental treatment. She died there Sunday, at 58. Funeral services will be 
held today in Berea, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the man who has been called the conscience of tennis has much on his 
mind.

STRIKING A BALANCE CAN HELP KEEP ATHLETES ON EVEN KEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sudden lack of desire, an overwhelming fatigue, unreasonable concern about 
one's performance . . . athletic burnout shows itself in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
But there are solutions to this growing problem, sports psychologists say, 
especially on the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a list of questions that coaches, parents and even athletes can ask to 
help understand the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the athlete dread going to practice or competitions? 
</P>
<P>
"That's different from being nervous," said Jonathan Brower, a Westlake Village 
sports sociologist and psychotherapist. "If they're saying, 'Oh, I don't want 
to do this, but I have to.' That's clearly a sign they don't want to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is the athlete in this particular activity? Are they in it to please 
Mom or Dad? The coach? Anyone but themselves? 
</P>
<P>
That is a common question asked by Richard Lister, a Costa Mesa sports 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things I ask a kid is why are they playing?" Lister said. "It 
sounds like a simple question, but they can't always give me an answer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the parent wants it more than the kid, they're in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the coach taking into consideration the athlete's long-term goals? 
</P>
<P>
An athlete who hopes to compete in college -- especially in sports such as 
distance running or swimming -- might be upended by a high school program that 
is far too vigorous, many coaches say. Youth and high school coaches should 
take an athlete's future into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Overall, how enjoyable is the activity for the athlete? 
</P>
<P>
"Some athletes hate the running or the swimming or whatever but like getting 
the medals," Brower said. "That might be an indication that burnout might be on 
the way. Ideally you like the intrinsic activity. Maybe you don't enjoy the 
pain of running 10 hard (laps on the track) but overall you should enjoy the 
activity for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 -- How does the athlete deal with winning and losing? Is he or she patient 
with reasonable progress? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of very good athletes don't like losing but they deal with it quite 
well," Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the 1976 Olympics, Frank Shorter said it was real important to him to 
come to terms with the idea that he might lose as well as win. Those that can 
deal with losing will last a lot longer in the sport than those who have to 
win. People who are really uptight about failure -- and unfortunately losing a 
race is defined as failure by some people -- are going to have problems sooner 
or later." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the athlete balancing his or her sport with other facets of their life? 
</P>
<P>
This, coaches and psychologists say, is one of the most important questions. An 
athlete that keeps his sport in balance with the rest of his life -- academics, 
friends, family, other hobbies -- is far better off in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"The athlete has to be living a total life," UC Irvine track Coach Vince 
O'Boyle said. "If the only words coming out of their mouth is how far they ran 
today, how fast they ran today, what kind of total person is being developed?" 
</P>
<P>
And finally, while "doing whatever I can to be the best," is a noble-sounding 
approach, it can have negative repercussions if the sport becomes an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is the attitude of the athlete," Brower said. "If (the attitude) is to 
do my best, to want to do well, but to fit this in with the rest of my life, 
those people will not burnout."

DEFENSE PLANT SURRENDERS TO O.C. GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: IN AN AGE OF WEAPONS REDUCTIONS, THE SALE OF NORTHROP PLANT SITE 
LOOKS LIKE A BETTER DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a year ago, Northrop Corp. said it would close its electronics facility 
here -- the first major defense plant built in Orange County -- and transfer 
the 1,600 workers elsewhere. Three months ago, the company agreed to sell the 
53-acre property to a Japanese firm, raising questions of what would become of 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is now clear: Weapons will never again be made there. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the sales agreement, Northrop has agreed to wipe the 
Electro-Mechanical Division complex off the face of the Earth. And with the 
$3-million, yearlong demolition that has just begun, another slice of Orange 
County's history will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be sad to see it go," said Robert L. Loring, an industrial and 
maintenance electrician who has worked at the Anaheim plant since the day it 
opened in October, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
The razing represents a rite of passage in the county's continued growth as it 
moves from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy. Just as citrus 
groves gave way to defense and manufacturing plants decades ago, many of these 
aging facilities are now being cleared for new office, retail and housing 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's decision to sell and clear the land is also related to the local 
economy and national and world politics. High land prices made the sale 
attractive. And the apparent end of the Cold War has brought hard times to many 
defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"The same sort of thing happened right after World War II to a lot of the 
little feeder plants that sprung up here to build small parts for the aircraft 
companies in Los Angeles," said local historian Jim Sleeper. "The war ended, 
and they went out of business." 
</P>
<P>
The passing of the county's first full-fledged aerospace facility "is likely to 
end up as a historical footnote, not a whole chapter," Sleeper said, noting 
that a structure has to exist for 50 years before it can qualify as a state or 
federal or even local historical landmark. The oldest parts of the Northrop 
facility are only 39 years old. 
</P>
<P>
While its demolition "is certainly worth mentioning," he said, "as a historian 
I was sorrier to hear in the mid-1950s that they'd torn down the first airplane 
factory in the county. It was built by Glenn Martin around 1911." 
</P>
<P>
When the demolition is done, the initial Northrop building, a sprawling factory 
with huge laminated wooden trusses holding up the roof -- an anomaly in today's 
world of steel beams and precast concrete -- will be gone. So will the acres of 
asphalt parking lots, the landscaping, storage buildings and all additions to 
the campus, including a three-story, 90,000-square-foot office and computer 
facility built just five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Northrop made the Snark missile, the Hawk missile loading and 
launching systems, a variety of mechanical, infrared and laser aiming devices 
and myriad weapons testing systems, including those for the Polaris and 
Poseidon missiles. The complex provided as many as 4,300 jobs in the early 
1960s, the heyday of the county's aerospace boom. 
</P>
<P>
It is not even clear whether there will be a marker left behind commemorating 
the spot on which stood the first of the flood of aerospace factories that 
helped shape Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Northrop facility is going because the company -- after almost four decades 
of expansion fueled by the Cold War, the space race and the Korean and Vietnam 
wars -- has been squeezed hard by the new reality of reduced defense spending. 
And Northrop officials, faced with paying off $1.2 billion in corporate debt in 
the midst of the defense decline, found a reported $40 million in their Orange 
County property. 
</P>
<P>
The purchaser, Taiyo Development U.S.A., a subsidiary of one of Japan's largest 
builders, made demolition of the entire campus a condition of the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Taiyo officials at the company's U.S. headquarters in Torrance won't divulge 
their plans for the acreage, bordered on three sides by Orangethorpe and 
Raymond avenues and the Riverside Freeway. But the company is a commercial and 
residential builder, and Anaheim city officials say they expect Taiyo to seek 
permission for an urban village-type of development that could include a 
high-density residential core surrounded by commercial and retail buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The razing was demanded by Taiyo for environmental reasons: to make sure the 
property is not contaminated with asbestos; polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs; 
leaking underground gasoline tanks, or the byproducts of nearly 40 years of 
machining, plating and degreasing. 
</P>
<P>
Edvin C. Remund, project manager for Holmes &amp; Narver Inc. in Orange, the 
design, engineering and construction firm Northrop hired in April to do the 
demolition, said that a survey of the entire location several years ago found 
that most of the underground gasoline storage tanks had already been removed 
and that there was no ground contamination from gasoline or other hazardous or 
toxic materials. But the buildings, as are most built before the late 1970s, 
are loaded with asbestos-containing materials that must be specially handled. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental concerns mean that you just don't go in with a wrecking ball and 
knock everything down in a week," Remund said. "There is an enormous amount of 
planning and special handling that needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Remund said, Holmes &amp; Narver has proposed that much of the 
material, from copper plumbing and electrical wires to asphalt and concrete, be 
salvaged. That slows demolition but will yield as much as 50,000 cubic yards of 
ground-up asphalt and concrete that can be sold and reused as base material for 
streets and highways. 
</P>
<P>
Remund estimated that recycling could recover as much as 75% of the material on 
the 53-acre site and could fetch as much as $1 million to help offset the costs 
of the demolition. About 100 workers will be needed for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northrop defense work now done in Anaheim, along with the 1,000 
remaining workers, will be relocated to Northrop plants in Hawthorne and El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Some employees, such as Loring, have decided to retire rather than transfer. In 
all, about 400 of the Anaheim plant's workers will retire or take voluntary 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Loring started with Northrop in 1947 in Hawthorne and moved to Anaheim in 1951, 
when the air was sweet with fragrance from the orange groves that surrounded 
the plant. And though the air is now thick with exhaust fumes from the 
congested Riverside Freeway, his memories of his career there are warm ones. 
</P>
<P>
The plant provided Loring, now 71, a good living, he said, and enabled him to 
move from Downey to Brea, where he and his wife raised two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this business a long time and seen a lot of ups and downs, but 
this looks like the biggest crunch, because of the government spending cuts," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This plant is heavily dependent on government contracts. It always has been, 
so it is just good business sense to consolidate the work. There's no use doing 
the same job in two different places." 
</P>
<P>
But the demise of the complex doesn't wipe away the Northrop presence in Orange 
County. Dozens of smaller companies scattered all over the county continue to 
produce parts for Northrop under various subcontracts. 
</P>
<P>
And a Northrop Electro-Mechanical Division unit, housed in a leased facility 
across Orangethorpe Avenue from the main campus, will continue in operation. 
Its 200 employes are producing parts for a 747 jumbo jet under a subcontract 
from Boeing Aircraft Corp.

IRVINE'S ALR EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FIRST DEAL WITH NATIONAL RETAIL CHAIN

Advanced Logic Research, the Irvine-based maker of IBM-compatible computers, is 
expected to announce today that it has signed its first agreement with a 
national computer retail chain to sell ALR computers. 
</P>
<P>
To date, ALR has sold its PCs primarily through computer resellers. 
</P>
<P>
As a relatively small PC maker in an intensely competitive business, the Irvine 
firm has had difficulty gaining space on retailers' shelves as an alternative 
to International Business Machines and Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
The development is yet another boost for ALR, which sold stock to the public 
for the first time on April 11. Last week, the Irvine firm signed a 
distribution agreement with Softsel/Microamerica, a giant PC distributor based 
in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
ALR expects to report its second-quarter results today.

Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America announced Tuesday that it has agreed to 
acquire a majority stake in Value Rent-A-Car Inc. for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi said control of the Deerfield, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
-based rental car firm, which operates 25 rental outlets in six states, would 
provide added exposure for Mitsubishi products and good used cars for 
Mitsubishi's 416 U.S. dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, scheduled to be completed by May 31, calls for Cypress-based 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales to acquire more than 50% of Value's stock and all of the 
company's real estate holdings. Most of Value's operations are in Florida, but 
the company also has facilities in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motor Sales, a bit player for most of the seven years it has been 
selling cars in the United States, has experienced a sales surge recently on 
the strength of a revamped product line. It has advanced to fourth place among 
Japanese car companies in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The company imports cars and light trucks built by Mitsubishi Motor Corp. in 
Japan and also sells vehicles produced by the Diamond Star Motors plant in 
Illinois, a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Fleet sales currently account for about 15% of Mitsubishi's sales, which 
totaled 150,476 vehicles last year. That percentage will not change with the 
acquisition of Value, the company said. But the portion of Mitsubishi vehicles 
in the Value fleet will jump from 10% to 85% by year's end.

BALLET: A SOVIET DIRECTOR IS LEADING THE JOINT PRODUCTION OF 'SWAN LAKE' BY THE 
BOLSHOI, KIROV AND BOSTON COMPANIES. BUT REHEARSALS ARE TENSE.

<P>
It was immediately dubbed the glasnost "Swan Lake," a first-ever collaboration 
among the Bolshoi, Kirov and Boston ballets. Officially opening tonight at Wang 
Center, the production's rehearsal period was more like a tension-filled summit 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The principal figure in this "Swan Lake" is the 81-year-old Konstantin 
Sergeyev, for 20 years the director of the Kirov Ballet and whose 1949 
choreography is drawn upon the classic works of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
A day before the first press performance over the weekend, Bruce Marks, 
artistic director of the Boston Ballet, candidly said: "Sergeyev and I are 
having tremendous differences of opinion about when things should happen on the 
stage, lighting design and all sorts of things. It's a terrible shock to him." 
</P>
<P>
There were also some bad feelings among the American dancers about Sergeyev, 
who had attained the highest rank for a male Soviet dancer, premier danseur 
noble, starting in 1930. "It was a tremendous shock to the dancers because of 
the way he works," said Marks. "We're a lot gentler with our artists. 
(Sergeyev) is kind of rough with them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no undue politeness. No tears, I don't think, in public, but a lot of 
bruised feelings among the dancers. Sergeyev is clearly from the Khrushchev and 
Brezhnev era rather than the Gorbachev era. 
</P>
<P>
"He goes back to a period when he who shouts loudest, wins. He goes back to the 
shoe-banging at the U.N. He bangs his shoes a lot. 'No, no, I won't have it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev did compromise with his American collaborators. At their request, he 
has changed the state-sanctioned ending of the ballet, which happily reunites 
the protagonists. Instead, the tragic ending envisioned by Petipa and Ivanov is 
restored. In this version, Siegfried and Odette take their lives to requite 
their love. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very impressed with the professionalism of Boston Ballet," Sergeyev said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an international company with different schools and we're fitting these 
different styles into a big classical work. . . . All the roles are being done 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
But Marks said he and Sergeyev still disagreed on the stage design: "He doesn't 
understand the scenery; it's not what they did in 1923 in Leningrad, which he 
still wants to reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
"And I keep saying 'No, no, no. Trust me.' American audiences like to see 
magic. We have very advanced stage-designing techniques here and we can't do 
scenery here where the hanging legs come to the ground and you see a little 
line. We have rocks and gnarled trees. And it doesn't look like the sweet 
friendly lake. It's a place of fantasy. This isn't the Soviet look at all, so 
it shocked Sergeyev as well." 
</P>
<P>
The scenery too is a joint venture with the Soviets. Costume and scenic design 
are by John Conklin, but many of the scenic flats were painted in the U.S.S.R. 
by Soyusteatr, the Union of Theater Workers. Soyusteatr is now a private 
company under Gorbachev's 1988 economic decrees, which allows it to negotiate 
international deals and retain profits. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dancers appearing between now and May 20 are Nina Ananiashvili and 
Alexei Fadeyechev of the Bolshoi Ballet and Yulia Makhalina, Tatiana Terekhova, 
Konstantin Zaklinsky and Aleksandr Lunev of the Kirov Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
For the six Soviet soloists, things have been a lot more upbeat, though Marks 
said that there is a double-glasnost situation here: "We have Bolshoi dancers, 
working with Kirov directors. It's never worked that way before. Everyone's 
sort of biting his lip saying: 'My version. My version.' " 
</P>
<P>
The glasnost project began 2 1/2 years ago when Marks' assistant artistic 
director, Anne-Marie Holmes, suggested that the Boston Ballet invite Sergeyev 
to stage a "Swan Lake." Holmes herself was a prima ballerina and spent several 
years dancing with the Kirov in the '60s under the tutelage of Natalia 
Dudinskya, the wife of Sergeyev and former prima ballerina with the Kirov. 
Currently, Dudinskya is principal teacher at the Leningrad Ballet School where 
Sergeyev is director. 
</P>
<P>
"Boston Ballet had a production and it wasn't to my liking at all," Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't to the tradition. I had danced 'Swan Lake' many times and I knew 
Sergeyev's production of 'Swan Lake' was the best I'd ever seen. And so I 
thought we must have this production because classics are the basics of your 
company." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, in 1987 Dudinskya staged "Giselle" for Boston Ballet and was eager 
for another collaboration when her husband's version of "Swan Lake" was 
suggested by Marks and Holmes. Equally important, Holmes serves as interpreter 
for the visiting artists, and peacekeeper of sorts. With such a large number of 
collaborators, rehearsals have been rife with tension. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night's gala press opening was well received. Having also hosted 
the 1988 "Making Music Together Festival" organized by Sarah Caldwell and the 
Opera Company of Boston, the city is forging ahead with artistic glasnost. And 
with 24,000 tickets sold for the run of "Swan Lake," sponsors are hoping that 
despite the rocky rehearsal there'll be more collaboration with Soviet artists 
on future productions.

OLD SCHOOL TIES LED TO THE WELLNESS BENEFIT;

FUND RAISING: COMEDIAN WOLFBERG LINED UP SEINFELD AND OTHERS IN MEMORY OF A PAL

Monday's benefit for the Wellness Community can trace its roots back more than 
25 years to Herricks High School in Long Island, where Dennis Wolfberg became 
friends with Ron Hoffman -- "the slowest member of the social studies class," 
as Wolfberg joked Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two stayed in touch after Hoffman moved to Orange County, where he became a 
successful real estate developer living in Corona del Mar. Wolfberg eventually 
headed West as well, moving to Los Angeles where, a few years ago, he got 
disturbing news about his old friend: Hoffman had cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfberg and Hoffman reunited in the winter of '88, when Wolfberg played the 
Improv in Irvine. Wolfberg spent the next afternoon with Hoffman, whose cancer 
was in remission. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked just great and was feeling great," Wolfberg recalled last week. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman told Wolfberg about the Wellness Community, a Santa Monica-based 
program providing free support and counseling programs to cancer patients (the 
same program was touted by the late Gilda Radner in her book "It's Always 
Something").

Hoffman and others were trying to bring the program to Orange Count. Wolfberg 
offered to do a benefit. Hoffman loved the idea. But his cancer returned, then 
he died in July at age 43. 
</P>
<P>
The other Wellness Community supporters, moving ahead with plans to open an 
interim center in Santa Ana this summer, decided to take Wolfberg up on his 
standing offer. Wolfberg lined up comedian friends Jerry Seinfeld, Steve 
Shaefer and Hiram Kasten, while the Improv donated use of the club. The benefit 
sold out at $100 a head, raising about $29,000 to help staff the Santa Ana 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just more thrilled than anything," Wolfberg said. "Ronnie was just a good 
buddy. I can only imagine the sense of comfort that a support group like (the 
Wellness Community) can offer." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's benefit -- which was videotaped for Hoffman's parents in Florida -- 
was not Hoffman's only legacy to the Wellness Community. On April 17, it was 
learned that the developer gave $100,000 to local efforts to establish a 
center.

ARTS AGENCY PLAN OKD BY SUPERVISORS; FUNDING IS DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
PARTNERSHIP: AN AD HOC COMMITTEE WILL SERVE AS AN INTERIM STATE-LOCAL CHANNEL 
FOR SUPPORT OF PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTY.

The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to develop a 
countywide arts agency to serve as "state-local partner" with the California 
Arts Council. But the board left open the question of how the agency would be 
funded. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board named the ad hoc Committee to Form an Orange County Arts 
Council, a group of local arts leaders, to serve as interim state-local partner 
to the CAC. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of a state-local partnership makes the county eligible for up to 
$80,000 a year in state and federal funds for arts programs, according to a 
local arts official. Orange County is one of only six in the state with no 
state-local partner, unable to receive any state and federal grants for 
redistribution to local arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
The board rejected a proposal to consider funding the agency with $50,000 
normally used for county parks. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said that he supports development of the agency but 
thought that approval of the funding proposal would imply a commitment to 
support the agency with county money. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder agreed. "We've got so many (funding) challenges 
this year and in the coming year," she said. "It's really scary. Let's take 
this one step at a time. . . . Funding (for the arts agency) can be addressed 
in the future." A recent county financial forecast indicated that the county 
may be facing a budget deficit of up to $63 million in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the one vote against developing the agency came from Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley, who had recommended the development in the first place but 
believed that the measure should include the funding proposal. 
</P>
<P>
County funding of the arts historically has been minimal. Riley, after reading 
a report he had requested on the subject from the county administrative office, 
had said he wanted to reasses the county's role. 
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc committee has asked the CAC for $12,500, a request to be considered 
in Sacramento on Thursday. Committee Chairman Charles Desmarais, director of 
the Laguna Art Museum, said the county should take advantage of current 
availability of arts funds instead of waiting for a permanent agency to be 
formed. He said the money, if granted, would be deposited until a permanent 
agency is in place. 
</P>
<P>
According to the supervisors' vote Tuesday, a structural plan for the agency 
will be developed by the county administrative office and the Environmental 
Management Agency in conjunction with the Department of Education, the Orange 
County Public Library and the League of Cities.

PANEL DOES A DOUBLE TAKE, DECIDES KRUGER WORK IS ART; 
</P>
<P>
RULING: BUILDING AND SAFETY COMMISSION REVERSES ITSELF, UNANIMOUSLY DECLARES 
MURAL IS NOT A SIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Building and Safety Commission on Tuesday reversed an earlier 
decision and voted unanimously to declare a huge proposed mural by New York 
artist Barbara Kruger to be a work of art and not a sign. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, which reversed a ruling a month ago by the same five-member panel, 
apparently permits the Museum of Contemporary Art to hire painters to install 
the Kruger mural on a 29-by-218-foot outside wall of the Temporary Contemporary 
museum in Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"Do what you want," museum officials were told by Tim Taylor, a top city 
department permit official, after Tuesday's vote. "Get the paint brushes out." 
The museum said the work might be installed within two months. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the encounter between Taylor and MOCA officials after the hearing 
was jovial, but the commission vote came after City Councilman Joel Wachs urged 
the board not to let the city government Los Angeles involve itself in 
controling the content of artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs' plea came after commissioner Benito A. Sinclair bluntly told museum 
officials that they would have to provide proof that the Kruger work could be 
considered as art in order to avoid jurisdiction of a city sign ordinance that 
would have drastically reduced the size of the mural and altered its contents. 
</P>
<P>
The mural is to be a red, white and blue work in a layout suggesting the 
American flag. In one corner, wording will identify the Temporary Contemporary. 
The area of the flag traditionally occupied by red and white stripes will be 
taken up by a series of nine politically provocative questions. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs asserted that the building and safety commission could cause Los Angeles 
to enter the ranks of communities that have slapped controls on the content of 
artworks. Wachs specifically likened a decision to declare the proposed Kruger 
mural as a sign to the prosecution of a Cincinnati museum on obscenity charges 
over a show of work of the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs also urged the commission to take the action he advocated to avoid 
providing Congress, which may continue or expand content-controls on work 
funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, with additional local precedents 
to justify legal regulation of what an artwork may say. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an extremely important issue for the city," said Wachs, who has 
been an activist on the City Council in favor of ordinances to try to control 
the proliferation of advertising signs in Los Angeles. "No council member ever 
considered the work of artists like Barbara Kruger. We wrote a (sign-control) 
law that never contemplated this issue. It would be ironic if a law drafted to 
enhance the city was the reason for denying contemporary art of greatness." 
</P>
<P>
In its 4-0 vote Tuesday, the commission reversed its own April 3 decision in 
which it upheld a finding by the Department of Building and Safety that the 
Kruger mural should be treated as a sign and thus subject to an ordinance that 
limits the total space in a sign that can be taken up by its written message to 
3% of the sign's total area. The massive Kruger work, with letters six feet 
tall, would be almost entirely devoted to its text message -- in keeping with 
an artistic style with which Kruger has been prominently identified. 
</P>
<P>
The mural proposal, which was approved last December by the city Cultural 
Affairs Commission, had roused controversy in Little Tokyo last year after 
residents and businessmen objected to a plan to include the wording of the 
Pledge of Allegiance. After a series of meetings in the community, Kruger 
agreed to delete the pledge wording, which opponents said would be an bitter 
reminder of the forced incarceration of Japanese-Americans in internment camps 
during World War II.

Fall, 1990, men's wear shown here this spring brought together the talents of 
the top names in Japanese fashion -- Issey Miyake, Hanae Mori, Kansai Yamamoto, 
the Koshino sisters (Junko and Hiroko), Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo for 
Comme des Garcons. 
</P>
<P>
Close behind these stars were the up-and-comers: Kensho Abe, Norihisa Ota, 
Kyoko Higa and Yoshiyuki Konishi who, unlike the others, do not show their 
collections in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The shows, organized by the Council of Fashion Designers, included 45 
collections of men's and women's wear. Two non-Asian designers, Barbara Bui and 
Helmut Lang, both based in Paris, also took part. 
</P>
<P>
While the '80s will be remembered as the decade that brought Japanese 
avant-garde men's wear to world attention, the '90s aren't starting with any 
such promise. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the men's wear designers here, Yoshiyuki Konishi is generally regarded 
as the most important contributor to the men's fashion image. For fall '90, 
however, he is showing the colorful collage-patterned sweaters that he 
introduced in the late '80s as the key to his collection. They've become 
something of a legend here. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most creative men's styles were fur outerwear, especially Tokio 
Kumagai's red and silver fox stoles. He showed other wraps with mink collars. 
</P>
<P>
Suede and leather, always a leading look in Tokyo collections for fall, ranged 
from smart red leather jackets paired with pencil-thin, black leather pants by 
Junko Koshino -- whose men's wear line is Mr. Junko -- to tan suede 
Eskimo-style parkas with hoods by Akira Onozuka for Odds On. 
</P>
<P>
Pants were inventive when they zipped at the side from ankle to mid-thigh, or 
laced up from the ankle to the knee. Quilted trousers in military green were 
shown at Tokio Kumagai Homme de Nuit, Kazutaka Katoh and Pashu. Other shapes 
ranged from jodhpurs at Odds On to stirrup pants at Koshino and shooting 
breeches at Kumagai Homme de Nuit. 
</P>
<P>
Office wear, never the centerpiece of a Japanese fashion given the conservative 
attitude toward business dress, was consistently conservative. Most Japanese 
executives dress as if they stepped off the same production line, in blue 
polyester suits year-round. Fashion individuality is rarely encouraged on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the younger generation, with their considerable disposable 
income, abundant credit cards, and world travels to inspire them, are 
rebelling. Not so much in what they wear to the office as in their evening and 
formal attire. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese men's wear designers see the after-five fashion field as especially 
fertile. For fall, they showed unusual jacket silhouettes, including a black 
gabardine style with buttons that angled from left to right by Koshino. 
</P>
<P>
Koshino opted for softer-line jackets. One for evening had a multilevel hemline 
cut to resemble a piece from a jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the considerable number of quality men's wear collections by 
Tokyo-based designers, there are no plans to make the clothes available in the 
United States. One major factor affecting this decision is the strength of the 
yen against the dollar. Because of it, prices of Japanese designer labels are 
exorbitantly high in American stores. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the Tokyo men's wear market remains strong. And the abundance of 
promising young designers suggests that will continue. But no one person has 
yet emerged as the obvious leader of the new decade.

DESIGNERS CREATE MORE STYLES IN THE SMALLEST OF THE SMALL SIZES TO GIVE PETITE 
ASIAN-AMERICAN SHOPPERS A BETTER FIT

The petite fashion market, for women 5 feet, 4 inches tall and under, has 
become one the busiest in the business. And local retailers say California's 
ever-growing Asian-American population is a major factor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Asians composed about 6.1% of Los Angeles County's ethnic population; 
in 1986, the figure rose to 8.6%, according to a University of Southern 
California study, "A Human Mosaic," by David M. Heer and Pini Herman. 
</P>
<P>
Many Asian women are 5-foot-4 and under, and retailers classify them as 
petites. Stores that cater to the Asian woman who wears designer labels say 
they have a clear sense of her priorities. 
</P>
<P>
I. Magnin's Southern California stores cater to that clientele in virtually 
every department, says Lily Taylor, vice president for the Southwestern region. 
In addition to stocking a wealth of petite clothing, even furs, upscale 
designer departments such as Chanel carry extra-small sizes 2 and 4 in some 
stores. Taylor says the I. Magnin stores frequented by Asian women include 
those in Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Woodland Hills, Sherman Oaks, Palos Verdes 
and La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Asians also have had an impact on Robinson's petite departments, says Chris 
Serafin, vice president and divisional merchandise manager of Pacesetter and 
Petite Sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
"Stores centered in Asian-populated areas have a stronger petite business than 
neighborhoods that don't," says Serafin, citing Robinson's in Costa Mesa, 
Westminster and Cerritos as examples. Among the most popular labels in 
Robinson's petite departments: Liz Claiborne and Jones New York, especially its 
suits and career looks. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California has one of the largest petite markets in the country, says 
Jo Lawley, senior vice president of marketing for The Broadway's Southern 
California stores. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sandy Altman, national petite sales manager for Ellen Tracy, 
shipments sent to the firm's West Coast vendors contain a heavy concentration 
of the smallest petite sizes. Other areas of the country receive a more 
balanced, standard range of sizes. 
</P>
<P>
While retailers are still learning about the needs and desires of their Asian 
clientele, they have noted two main aspects of the fashion look Asian women 
prefer. "Conservative styling is key, and a precision fit is paramount," 
Serafin says. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding alterations is what leads one customer, Donna Kato, to the petite 
department. Kato, a Japanese-American journalist formerly based in Los Angeles, 
has recently been traveling in Japan. She says she buys the bulk of her working 
wardrobe in U.S. stores' petite departments. 
</P>
<P>
She believes the influx of Asian-Americans has influenced the petite market. 
Along with Los Angeles, she says, San Francisco is a good city for petite 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the expanded selection of smaller-size petite clothes here, many Asian 
women believe there is room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more petite clothes around now than there was when I was in high 
school," says Karen Nakakihara, a Size 2 who lives in Cerritos and works in the 
Norwalk district attorney's office. "But the section should still be expanded." 
</P>
<P>
"Finding dress clothes in my size is a pain," says Kim Chan, 20, a part-time 
model and student at the University of California, Irvine. Chan, a Size 3, says 
that when she finds a style she likes, it is either sold out, or is not 
available in her size. Though she can order some things, it isn't always 
possible. She hopes stores will continue to increase the number of tiny petite 
sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I must be competing with many other Asian petites who wear the same 
sizes," sighs Chan, "but if I'm constantly looking for clothes, others like me 
must be in need, too."

Swimsuits are like ice cream this season. There are almost too many flavors 
from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
The newest Hollywood glamour styles are inspired by the '40s. Athletic looks 
are based on surfers' wet suits or competitive swimmers' styles. And the most 
unusual are eclectic beach costumes mixing cyclist shorts or unitards with 
bikinis, exotic sarongs, ethnic jewelry, elaborate straw hats and high-top 
sneakers. The look is anything but store-bought. Like the perfect summer 
sundae, you have to make it yourself.

If you think fashion is just supposed to be fun, fall '90 could be the party 
you've been waiting for. Clothes haven't been such a hoot since Jackie O lived 
in the White House and the peppermint twist was the only dance in town. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the grandest names in the business are flirting with this giddy flame. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Christian Lacroix has regaled the '90s rich hippie with cashmere 
ponchos, poor boy sweaters and op-art tent dresses that collide with op-art 
tights. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Montana has the '90s answer to Beatlemania in his Sergeant Pepper 
pantsuits decorated with fine gold chain. Sixties-inspired capes, halter 
dresses and short, tent-shaped coats by Montana come in Andy Warhol shades of 
red, yellow and violet. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, Gianni Versace is cutting shapes last seen at the garden party in 
Federico Fellini's "Juliette of the Spirits." Fitted bodices expand into bell 
skirts; shaped necklines play against shaped hemlines. And legs are veiled in 
ivory hose. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers Charlotte Neuville, Adrienne Vittadini and Marc Jacobs for Perry 
Ellis are bringing back maxi coats with miniskirts, sleeveless skimmer dresses 
to wear with elbow-length gloves and the color white as a replacement for 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Londoners have reinvented hot pants -- the shortest of the shorts -- and 
fake-fur chubs -- those cropped jackets to wear day or night. Veteran 
fashioneer Vivienne Westwood has the look down pat. Newcomer Rifat Ozbek goes 
'60s for the first time, with his crushed-velvet bell bottoms and 
midriff-baring tops. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles designer Melinda Besnoin for Melivier shows '60s-chic dresses for 
fall. They havejewel necklines and narrow sleeves, and go best with sturdy 
pumps. Tokyo's Norihisa Ota, a trend-setter there, is styling James Bond girl 
clothes inspired by '60s ski wear. The preferred color is Pucci pink.

<P>
For 25 top London designers, fashion awareness is increasingly about much more 
than where to hang a season's hemline. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinated by Arabella Pollen and designer/retailer Joseph Ettedgui, the group 
is organizing a celebrity fashion show May 24 at London's Natural History 
Museum to support the Friends of the Earth Rainforest campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the Friends of the Earth Rainforest group approached us," said 
Pollen, "and it's taken off from there. Certainly, I was aware of the problems 
before I became involved in this protest but I have to say I was ignorant. I've 
learned a lot, and through my own heightened awareness I've made other people 
think." 
</P>
<P>
The group she and Ettedgui have organized includes Joe Casley Hayford, Jasper 
Conran, Bruce Oldfield, Betty Jackson, Anthony Price, Artwork, Caroline 
Charles, David Fielden, Edina Ronay, John Galliano, John Richmond, Katharine 
Hamnett, Marion Foale, Monica Chong, Paul Smith, Richard James, Victor 
Edelstein, Vivienne Westwood and Workers for Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Each will present selections from their fall/winter collections in an informal 
show around the stuffed dinosaur in the museum's great hall. Everyone has 
offered to design an outfit with a rain-forest theme, which will be auctioned 
at some point to raise even more money for the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Ettedgui and Pollen, who are trying to persuade top international models to fly 
in for the show, have come up with a back-to-back limited edition commemorative 
T-shirt, with all the profits going to Friends of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Even before becoming officially involved in the Friends of the Earth movement, 
several British designers were making their ecological sentiments known. Betty 
Jackson used intarsia knit maps on the backs of long knit coats -- her tribute 
to the Brazilian rain forest -- and hat designer Stephen Jones designed Mylar 
caps printed with satellite weather "one world" maps. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Joe Casley Hayford embroidered his clothes with autumn leaves. And 
then there's militant Katharine Hamnett. Since 1985 she has used slogan 
T-shirts to express her views on everything from acid rain to pollution to the 
killing of whales. At a fashion reception hosted by Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher at 10 Downing Street several seasons ago, Hamnett showed up wearing a 
T-shirt which read: "58 Percent Don't Want the Pershing," her comment on 
Thatcher's decision to allow American missiles on British soil. 
</P>
<P>
On June 14, she will be in New York to attend a conference at the United 
Nations to discuss these and other fashion/environmental issues.

THROW-AWAY JEWELRY

<TEXT>
<P>
Lauren Grossman lives in a Seattle neighborhood where "sometimes on a holiday, 
people do a little target practice." Making the most of a difficult situation, 
she collects the empty shells and turns them into jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, whose work is featured at New Stone Age in Los Angeles, is equally 
adept with industrial salvage and discarded Christmas-tree decorations. By 
collecting and turning potential trash into "eco-jewelry," she and other 
artists are giving the word recycled new meaning. And a savvy, receptive public 
is buying. 
</P>
<P>
New York jewelry designer Wendy Gell is another prime example of a designer 
making eco-jewelry fashionable. Five years ago she designed pieces similar to 
those carried now by Nordstrom: combinations of beach glass, bark and living 
bromeliads. "But I kept getting back this dead jewelry," she says with a laugh. 
Store employees and customers didn't realize the bromeliads had to be spritzed 
with water once a week. "Now they do," she says. 
</P>
<P>
For Remi Rubel, whose jewelry is at New Stone Age and Tops in Malibu, bottle 
caps are the metal of choice. She flattens them and inserts her renditions of 
famous art. Second-hand spoons, metal strainers and whisks are the makings of 
Mike Kelley's art, including necklaces and futuristic eyewear. Made in Salem, 
Ore., they're carried at Tops. 
</P>
<P>
California designers Allison Stern and Carolyn Carpenter have their own bags of 
recycled tricks. Stern's jewelry, crafted from electronic surplus, is at Tops. 
Carpenter's pins and earrings, cut from antique-kinomo fabric, are at the Far 
Eastern Corner, Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Art that is "non-traditional and kind of primitive" appeals to New York artists 
Joanna Ruisi-Besares and her husband, Davi Ruisi. For their jewelry, available 
at Faux on Melrose Avenue, they create papier-mache "stones" from recycled, 
unbleached newsprint and color them with nontoxic pigments. 
</P>
<P>
Truly primitive jewelry, such as necklaces made from porcupine quills, bird 
feathers and seeds collected from the floor of the Brazilian rain forest, can 
be found at Nature's Own in the Beverly Center. The fledgling cottage industry 
is being encouraged by zoologist Roxanne Kremer of Rosemead, Calif., who says a 
percentage of the sales goes to the International Society for the Preservation 
of the Tropical Rainforest.

Jewelry designer Deanna Hamro has some unexpected advice for the woman who 
wants the latest accessories for spring: Consider wearing none. 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken, vivacious Hamro, 34, whose sparkling jewelry is in some of the 
best stores nationwide and whose custom accessories are shown with the 
collections of top New York designers, is at this moment a walking billboard 
for the unaccessorized look. She is wearing a black Chanel T-shirt, black 
Azzedine Alaia leggings and a men's khaki blazer by Katharine Hamnett. 
</P>
<P>
But no jewelry. She dons a glass jewel-encrusted cuff for a photo, then takes 
it off when the photographer is finished. 
</P>
<P>
"For day, depending on the mood of the woman and where she is, she can go 
without any accessories or wear some small piece of real jewelry," Hamro 
advises as she eases her slender, 5-foot-10 frame into an office chair. "I love 
to see fashion spreads without any jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
For those who are uncomfortable without a bit of a glimmer, she suggests making 
a point with one unusual piece. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go funky with a big brooch. Or you can put on a pair of jeans and a 
chiffon blouse and a pair of long earrings. But I don't also want to see a 
choker and a cuff and a belt, too. I feel very strongly about not overdoing it. 
I don't see somebody dressed in an Alaia dress full of jewelry. An Alaia dress 
is showing your figure and you're already making a statement." 
</P>
<P>
Evening, she says, is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
"I love piled-on jewelry for evening," she says, then laughs. "But don't pile 
on a ton of makeup on top of that. You've got to do one or the other." 
</P>
<P>
The story of how she rose to the helm of her $2-million fashion jewelry company 
is a haphazard jumble of whim, contradiction and strong opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Hamro grew up in San Clemente, just a couple blocks from the beach. At age 2 
she began discussing her wardrobe with the family, and by age 4 her grandmother 
had taught her to knit. As an independent and commerce-minded preteen of 11, 
she assembled wire and bead earrings to sell at a bikini boutique down the 
hill. She modeled bikinis in her teens. 
</P>
<P>
Without completing high school, she ran off to be a fashion model in Mexico 
City, Milan, Los Angeles and Madrid. She settled, briefly, in Mexico City, 
making suede clothes and accessories studded with rhinestones. She discovered 
she loved the stones but was frustrated by her lack of expertise in 
pattern-making. So, in 1983, she plunged into accessories. A chance trip to a 
hobby store introduced her to the idea behind her first costume jewelry 
collection: rhinestones pressed in papier-mache. 
</P>
<P>
"It was when jewelry was more artsy-craftsy looking," she says. "What I became 
known for was my pointed-back pave." 
</P>
<P>
The technique, which Hamro still uses, requires embedding point-backed Austrian 
crystals into metal to create an overall rhinestone sheen. Other jewelers, she 
says, use less-brilliant flat-backed stones, which are easier to glue down. 
</P>
<P>
Papier-mache gave way to the more sophisticated, 24-karat gold electroplated 
brass that she now uses exclusively. Though she still does her signature paved 
crystals, Hamro's jewelry today includes custom-made, handblown Italian and 
French glass cabochon stones, custom-made chains from Paris, and antique beads 
and handmade glass pearls from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
This season her earrings and brooches are oversized. Some have rope or leaf 
details. Brooches cost $150 to $300, cuffs range from $400 to $500, belts from 
$500 to $700, and earrings average about $250. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I love what I do so much, I've educated myself and tried to make 
things better technically. I'm a great fan of certain people's work, so I've 
tried to emulate their quality," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Among those she admires are Bulgari, Kieselstein-Cord and Elizabeth Gage in 
fine jewelry, and Chanel and Isabelle Canovas in fashion jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who admire her are designers Carolyne Roehm, Carolina Herrera, 
Oscar de la Renta and Mary Ann Restivo. They all faxed her sketches of their 
fall lines so she could make special pieces for their runway shows. 
</P>
<P>
"She's one of our top vendors in the jewelry area," says Lynn Roberts Hover, 
assistant manager of Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills. "We feel she is very 
innovative in her use of the medium. She works magic with her beautiful beads." 
</P>
<P>
Hamro says Neiman Marcus has added her collections to stores outside Beverly 
Hills. She also sells to I. Magnin, Barneys New York, Saks Fifth Avenue and 
Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
Current design influences include the 8 1/2-foot-tall 19th-Century primitive 
blackamoor statues of Nubian slaves that she bought at an antique store. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion trends also sway her. She is making the long earrings that are popular 
and notes they will continue into fall. Her personal favorite earrings for fall 
are a pair of oversized buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Living in California doesn't affect the look of her work, or the way she works, 
she says. "I could pick up my business right now and move it to Italy, Paris or 
Istanbul as long as I have (overnight mail) faxes, Women's Wear Daily and 
Vogue." 
</P>
<P>
California does affect her in other ways. Her brother Jon and sister Cathy are 
involved in her business, and she says she likes the protected and stable 
surrounding of family and longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
California also allows her tremendous freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, you can call your own shots completely and I think that's great. You can 
run around in a T-shirt, shorts and a baseball cap and that's OK. You can go 
out at night in the most eccentric outfit, and if you're comfortable in it, 
nobody here is shocked. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a quote on my wall by Carole Little (that said), 'People in New York 
think if you're in California, you're sitting out there on the beach and you 
come into the office once in a while to do a bright orange something or other.' 
</P>
<P>
"I put that up there a long time ago when I could never make it to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Hamro still doesn't take time to head to the beach. She is ready to launch 
evening-wrap and handbag divisions that she hopes will garner half a million 
dollars each in the next year. They'll be shown to buyers this month and will 
arrive in the stores for fall, priced from $200 to $350, in velvet, charmeuse 
and brocade. 
</P>
<P>
She has also made a line of cocktail dresses with Los Angeles designer James 
Tarantino. The five dresses will have Hamro's touch in the form of gold chain 
and rope straps, or pearl and Venetian glass details. 
</P>

NEW COSMETIC REFILLS SAVE MONEY, THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

Beyond no-frills packaging lies an old idea -- refillable cosmetics. (Remember 
Granny's ornate refillable compact?) Though cosmetic giants such as Estee 
Lauder, Guerlain and Clinique offer refillable compacts ranging in price from 
$25 to $125, with plastic-encased refills selling for $6.50 to $28, powder is 
no longer the lone refillable. 
</P>
<P>
"A variety of companies are offering at least a few refillable makeup 
products," says Diane Consalvi, cosmetic buyer for Nordstrom's Orange County 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
One company that combines makeup products in one component is Intelligent 
Skincare. It offers a refillable, customized system called the Selector. The 
purse-size case, available at Nordstrom, sells for about $15. A variety of 
makeup -- sold separately and priced from $5.50 to $16 -- fits inside. There 
are slide-out blushes, eye shadows and face powders. 
</P>
<P>
At Body Scents in Sherman Oaks, environmentally responsible customers often ask 
for refills of the shop's personal hair and skin products, says Shirley 
Wilkoff, shop co-owner. Though such requests are infrequent, Wilkoff expects 
they will increase as environmental concerns grow. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a good idea, ecologically speaking, but I think it is best to 
start with a new plastic bottle after the second refill," says Wilkoff, 
explaining that freshness and consistency cannot be ensured without an 
absolutely clean container. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Perry, district manager of the Canada-based, cruelty-free Makeup Art 
Cosmetics, agrees that reusing containers is problematic. Still, the firm is 
doing its ecological best to ensure its plastic containers are reused. It 
offers a free lipstick for every six empty Makeup Art containers the customer 
returns to its cosmetic counters -- locally, in select Nordstrom stores. Makeup 
Art then transports the containers to public recycling centers.

School cheating -- An article Tuesday on alleged cheating on standardized tests 
in the Los Angeles Unified School District incorrectly implied that school 
board President Jackie Goldberg had direct knowledge that teachers tampered 
with exams. The district has taken action against employees involved in the 
cheating scandal. But it has not identified the employees or specified whether 
teachers were involved.

CHARLES BARKLEY IS ONE MAKING IT HAPPEN FOR 76ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ALDRIDGE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people hold one clear image of Charles Barkley: that of the wild man, 
standing on a chair after the Philadelphia 76ers' April 19 brawl in Detroit, 
yelling to his teammates: "Hey, fellas! What do we think of the Pistons?" And 
the wild team basically telling Detroit what it could do with its championship 
trophy, with the wild man leading the profane cheers. 
</P>
<P>
That's one aspect to Charles Barkley. Here's another. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see (basketball) as a game," he said. "I see it differently. When I go 
to a hockey game, my wife goes to see the scoring and stuff like that. I just 
am looking at how fast those guys handle the puck, their hand-eye coordination. 
When I go see boxing, I don't see guys go get beat up. I just like to watch the 
combinations and things like that. You just see things differently." 
</P>
<P>
You may think Charles Barkley loud, rowdy, crude. You see the $35,000 in major 
fines he's racked up this season in five separate incidents involving: a) 
cursing; b) slapping; c) gambling; d) shoving; e) a free-for-all melee. And you 
may dismiss him as a thug. 
</P>
<P>
He fights Bill Laimbeer and laughs at opponents and gets technical foul after 
technical foul. He butts heads with teammate Rick Mahorn, his "Bump-n-Thump" 
partner, Cro-Magnon style. Don't ignore it, because it's the bit of madness 
that makes him unique. But it's not all. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing about Charles Wade Barkley on a basketball floor that's any 
different from Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird, or Michael Jordan, or any of the 
others in the league whose talents are such that they can carry a team to a 
championship. They live in that rarefied air where winning is obsessive and 
losing cuts to the bone. And they have power to control that fate somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
"You just see things that other people don't see," Barkley said. "One problem 
(Coach) Jimmy (Lynam) has talked to me about is sometimes I think I'm playing 
along with myself. I'll try things and think, 'Well, he should have had that 
pass.' Jimmy says, 'Well, you would have had that pass, but he can't get that.' 
And that's the thing he's taught me. He says, 'Remember, everybody out there is 
not as good as you. So don't throw a guy a pass that you would catch, because 
your hands are so much better than everybody else's.' " 
</P>
<P>
Is that bragging? At face value, yes. But ask Michael Jordan if anyone can stop 
him one-on-one, and you'd get much the same answer. And, "It ain't bragging," 
former Dallas Cowboys linebacker Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson once said, "if 
you can back it up." 
</P>
<P>
This hasn't been Barkley's best year statistically, but most anyone would 
settle for per-game averages of 25.3 points (sixth-best in the league), a .605 
field-goal percentage (second) and 11.6 rebounds (third), especially when it's 
the base for a 53-29 record and an Atlantic Division title. 
</P>
<P>
In the 76ers' two victories opening the best-of-five first-round series against 
Cleveland, Barkley has improved his game a couple of notches, averaging 35 
points and 14.5 rebounds going into Tuesday night's first road test. There are 
sellout crowds at the Spectrum again, watching his coast-to-coast drives. 
Basketball is fun in Philadelphia again. And Charles Barkley is a bona fide 
most valuable player candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Hall-of-Famer before he even gets in the Hall of Fame," Mahorn said. 
"He's just so intense and that makes everything happen because everybody feeds 
off his intensity. I appreciated him when I was playing against him because you 
give that person that kind of respect." 
</P>
<P>
So if Barkley has to carry the 76ers through the playoffs at the key times, 
that's no problem. For while no one is a bigger fan of Barkley than Barkley, 
neither does anyone expect more.

"When your team needs it, you've got to say, 'Well, damn, you want to do all 
this stuff,' " he said. "So you've got to do it. It's easy to say it, but I've 
got so much confidence that I can do it. ... I didn't like the way (Akeem 
Olajuwon) played (against the Lakers in Game 2 of that series), 'cause I think 
he didn't. ... You see Michael Jordan? That's what you've got to do." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot 4 3/4-inch Barkley is being guarded by Cleveland's 6-11 forward, 
John Williams, on the left side of the basket. Barkley drives. Williams goes 
with him. Barkley dribbles behind his back to free himself. Williams gives 
chase. They both go up, and Barkley hangs just long enough to score from the 
baseline. It is an amazing sequence. 
</P>
<P>
It surprised Barkley too. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I do things it just happens. It sounds like a cliche. I think 
God is in my body," he said. "I mean like the move I made ... when I saw the 
replay, I said, 'How did I do that?' When I took it behind my back and went up 
and brought it down and went on back up, it was like, 'Man, somebody else was 
controlling that shot.' I just believe ... I think it's a belief that you're 
going to make something good happen." 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "I've never seen a guy like that. He's like a one and only. 
People talk about Michael Jordan but I don't think there's going to be another 
Charles Barkley who can do the stuff that he can do." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley says he's played better in the past, only that he didn't have 
supporting players, so no one noticed. This season has brought Mahorn from 
Detroit (via Minnesota), guard Johnny Dawkins from San Antonio and an improved 
Hersey Hawkins. Where the 76ers once had a reputation for talking loudly and 
playing soft, they now foul hard and play mean. 
</P>
<P>
Profane to each other, they protect each other. Barkley says Lynam, whom he 
calls "Little Knucklehead," should be chosen coach of the year, while 
dismissing the possibility that he himself should be MVP. 
</P>
<P>
They are a closer bunch, complete with symbolic gestures to promote unity. They 
took to wearing earrings when they got on a winning streak early in the season; 
now they are donning black shoes, Bulls-style, for the playoffs. Mahorn is 
trying to, in his words, "cram three years of playoff experiences into a week" 
of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
And Barkley is even more effective at the end of games. 
</P>
<P>
"My college coach (Auburn's Sonny Smith) told me once, he said, 'I have never 
seen a player who gets stronger as the game goes on and as the season goes on.' 
I just try to beat my guy up for two quarters, three quarters, and try to have 
something. Just willpower down the stretch. And a lot of it is just emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of players have emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah, that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of players have willpower. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true. It's something special that God has given me. A lot of guys 
can't ... they get tired and they just can't make things happen. ... I feel 
like I can raise my game late in the game. Maybe it's what you just said. Maybe 
the other guys are getting tired. But I believe that I can make plays, and it's 
just strictly desire." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dawkins: "When we get down at that end of the court, his eyes just light 
up. When his eyes light up you know he's ready to go. And his eyes light up 
every time we're at the offensive end." 
</P>
<P>
"You do, I think, find yourself at times standing there saying, 'Well, what is 
he going to do this time?' " Hawkins said. "But that's Charles Barkley." 
</P>
<P>
Bump and Thump are showering. Things are crashing in there. Loud words. Threats 
are being made. The two emerge. There seems to be one towel, but two persons. 
Bump, Barkley, has it. Thump, Mahorn, would like it. Barkley punches Mahorn in 
the chest. Mahorn picks up a basketball. Barkley picks up a scooper filled with 
ice. They stand toe-to-toe. 
</P>
<P>
Lynam is helpless. He pleads for order. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball is tossed. It hits the scooper. Laughter all around. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if Barkley and Mahorn have been together their entire careers, but 
it's only been a few months. The effect has been dramatic. Mahorn takes care of 
the really dirty work underneath, holding off the opposition's bigger 
rebounders and scorers. Finally freed after playing down low alone for so long, 
Barkley can freelance more defensively. Offensively, small forwards try to 
guard him. Very few can. 
</P>
<P>
"To play with him," Mahorn said, "you can't sit back and be in awe of him, but 
you can also sit back and appreciate that he's playing with you instead of 
against you." 
</P>
<P>
The last couple of years have mellowed Barkley everywhere except on the 
basketball court. His marriage 15 months ago and the birth of his daughter 
Christiana late last year have radically switched his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came to the NBA I felt like all my goal was, was to do the best 
that I could," he said. "Have a nice career, and if we win a championship, that 
would be great. And then I think I started listening to other people when they 
said, 'Well, if you don't win the championship, you're not a success.' And 
that's not right. Because everybody's not going to win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is my second legitimate shot. I feel like we do have the talent 
to win it all, and I'd be very disappointed. But like I said, I'm back in the 
thing where it's just fun now. I can live with whatever happens, if we do our 
best. We have beaten everybody in the league. So if we go out and do our best 
we have a shot at it all."

Mormon Switch: The Mormon church in Salt Lake City has dropped wording that 
required women to obey their husbands and that portrayed the clergy of other 
religions as agents of Satan. Women now must vow instead to obey God in the 
"endowment" ceremony, a ritual the church teaches is necessary for members to 
live with God after death. "The changes have allowed me to go to the temple 
with renewed joy," said Lavina Fielding Anderson, editor-elect of the Journal

JIMMY LEE SMITH, 'ONION FIELD' KILLER, SEIZED ON KNIFE CHARGE

<P>
Paroled "Onion Field" police killer Jimmy Lee Smith has been arrested for 
allegedly threatening a man with an 8-inch kitchen knife in mid-April, police 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 59, was arrested in the San Fernando Valley on Tuesday and was placed on 
"parole hold." 
</P>
<P>
No bail was set. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of arrests since Smith was paroled in 1982 after 
serving 19 years in prison for his role in the 1963 slaying of Los Angeles 
Police Officer Ian Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and Officer Karl Hettinger were abducted in Hollywood by Smith and 
Gregory Powell and were driven to an onion field south of Bakersfield. Powell 
killed Campbell and shot at Hettinger, who escaped in the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The April 18 incident evolved from an argument Smith had with his female 
roommate, police said. The woman ordered Smith to move out, and when a male 
friend intervened, Smith allegedly pulled out a knife and threatened to cut 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Powell and Smith were twice sentenced to death for the killing, but the 
sentences were reduced to life in prison when the state Supreme Court ruled the 
death penalty unconstitutional.

DE KLERK, MANDELA URGE END OF APARTHEID AS TALKS BEGIN

<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk and African National Congress leader Nelson 
Mandela today urged the swift abolition of apartheid and began historic talks 
aimed at ending white-minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
The three days of meetings are to remove obstacles to full-scale negotiations 
on a new constitution that would give the 28-million black majority a voice in 
national affairs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk and Mandela, standing on the lawn of a Dutch colonial mansion where 
the talks were held, said South Africans of all races want swift change. All 
political parties must work toward a peaceful solution to racial and political 
divisions, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, the pro-apartheid Conservative Party walked out of a debate in 
Parliament to protest the talks. The Conservative leader, Andries Treurnicht, 
said the government should not negotiate with an organization that has carried 
out guerrilla attacks and still was committed to armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"South African law forbids all these actions," said Treurnicht, whose party is 
the main opposition in Parliament's white chamber. The tri-cameral Parliament 
also has chambers for people of mixed-race and Indian descent. Blacks are 
excluded.

Winnie Mandela's chief bodyguard during the imprisonment of her husband Nelson 
was charged in court today with murdering a teen-age activist. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Richardson, 41, trainer of the self-styled Mandela United Football Club, 
pleaded not guilty to the 1988 killing of 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, whose 
death caused a furor around Winnie Mandela and her entourage. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's appearance in the Supreme Court in Johannesburg came after the 
case had been repeatedly postponed for over a year. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela has said her associates removed Seipei and three other youths 
from a Methodist-run shelter in Soweto township in December, 1988, to protect 
them from sexual abuse by a white priest -- an allegation rejected by the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, a well-known political activist in his own right, was found dead in a 
ditch, his throat slit, the following month.

SANTA ANA YOUTH'S CONDITION CRITICAL AFTER 12,000-VOLT SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Santa Ana youth was in critical condition this morning after 
12,000 volts of electricity blasted through his body when a metal radio tower 
he was trying to install came in contact with a high-voltage power line, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two others who were involved in the incident are hospitalized in serious 
condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Battalion Chief John Chambers said the bolt of electricity that raced 
through Sergio Olguin briefly stopped his heartbeat. The current burst holes in 
Olguin's hands and feet before exiting his body. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics revived him before rushing him to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital 
and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Olguin, his 17-year-old brother, Caesar, and a friend, Carlos Mangana, 24, were 
installing a makeshift 48-foot tower at their home in the 2000 block of Elder 
Street when the metal structure tipped and touched the power lines. 
</P>
<P>
The Olguins' sister, Ana, 21, said the bolt of electricity threw Caesar and 
Mangana into some nearby bushes. The tower crashed to the ground pinning 
Sergio's leg, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried giving him (Sergio) mouth-to-mouth (resuscitation) but he wouldn't 
come back," she said. "Caesar came crawling in the house . . . and we called 
911." 
</P>
<P>
Chambers said Sergio suffered serious exit wounds. Hospital authorities were 
attempting to determine the extent of injuries to his vital organs. 
</P>
<P>
At UCI, doctors were conducting similar tests on Caesar and Mangana, who both 
suffered second- and third-degree burns.

A drug once hailed as helping to restore the memory of Alzheimer's disease 
patients has failed to improve symptoms of the debilitating disorder to a 
significant extent, according to a new study released today. 
</P>
<P>
The study by a group in Montreal assessed the effects of a drug called THA on 
52 patients with the disease, which is characterized by progressive memory loss 
and senility. 
</P>
<P>
The study is published in the current issue of the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug still could be used experimentally to explore how it works and how it 
affects Alzheimer's, but I really can't see it as being marketable," said Dr. 
Serge Gauthier, director of the McGill Center for Studies in Aging, who led the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
"It has not proven effective in large-scale studies and it is known to be 
toxic," he said.

A former Australian beauty queen with an allergy to 20th-Century chemicals has

Debra Paoletto, 26, whose condition was diagnosed in 1988 as an "environmental

Last June the former Miss Sunshine Coast retreated to a coastal hide-out,

HUD: A HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT OFFICIAL CONVICTED OF TAKING BRIBES 
DESCRIBES HOW A GRANT WAS ARRANGED AFTER THE DEVELOPER APPEALED TO THEN-VICE 
PRESIDENT BUSH.

<P>
A former federal housing official, who admits taking bribes, testified today 
that a federal HUD grant was arranged for a project after its developer 
appealed to then-Vice President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
DuBois L. Gilliam, a former deputy assistant secretary of housing and urban 
development, testified today about scandals at HUD and described in detail how 
officials there steered projects to political friends, including members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, who is serving an 18-month federal prison sentence, was testifying 
under a court grant of immunity from further prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House panel 
investigating HUD, Gilliam said HUD officials engaged in a grant swap in order 
to provide $500,000 requested in 1985 to conduct a feasibility study for a 
Latino trade center in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said that Hector Barreto, then president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber 
of Commerce, sought a HUD grant for the project but that he first told Barreto 
that it was not qualified under Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.'s discretionary 
fund for special projects. 
</P>
<P>
He said he got a call that afternoon from Deborah Gore Dean, assistant to 
Pierce, saying Barreto had met with Bush and that "she had received a call from 
the vice president's staff asking about the grant, and indicated her desire to 
try to help get the project funded." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Gilliam said, he persuaded a Kansas City assistant city manager to 
provide the grant from the city's Community Development Block Grant funds, 
provided by HUD, and that in turn he arranged to have a special grant go to 
Kansas City to replace that money. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, let's make a deal -- you do this and I'll do this," Gilliam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He did not name the person in the vice president's office. Gilliam said he was 
unclear about the connection to Bush's office, but said Dean had "indicated 
something . . . about Mr. Barreto going on the vice president's plane." 
</P>
<P>
Lantos, before the meeting, described the case this way: "We will hear 
testimony from Mr. Gilliam about special projects -- how a particular project 
was funded at the request of 'someone' in the office of the vice president, in 
order to get a Hispanic leader to accompany the then-vice president on a plane 
trip to Puerto Rico." 
</P>
<P>
Once a trusted assistant to Pierce during the Reagan Administration, Gilliam 
painted a picture of rampant political abuse at the agency during his initial 
appearance before the House Governmental Operations subcommittee on employment 
and housing. 
</P>
<P>
His second round of testimony involved so-called HUD "special project" grants, 
which were made from the secretary's discretionary fund.

The Senate Budget Committee today adopted a Democratic-proposed $1.2-trillion 
budget for 1991 that cuts defense spending $9.9 billion below what President 
Bush wants. 
</P>
<P>
The package was adopted on a vote of 14 to 9, with all of the committee's 
Democrats joined by a single Republican -- Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) in 
voting for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal mirrors the plan passed by the Democratic-controlled House on 
Tuesday. Both packages are seen by many lawmakers as a prelude to possible 
negotiations between the White House and the Democratic majorities in Congress 
on a spending plan for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal claims to reduce next year's deficit by $43 billion by taking 
credit for $13 billion in defense cuts, $13.9 billion in new tax revenues, and 
$6.2 billion in new user fees and other receipts. The growth of benefit 
programs such as Medicare would be slowed by $5.6 billion while other domestic 
and foreign aid efforts would be cut by $3.5 billion.

Eastman Kodak Co. said today its first-quarter earnings fell 6% in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for the quarter was $199 million, or 61 cents per share, compared to 
$212 million, or 65 cents per share, in the first quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the first quarter dipped 2% to $4.11 billion from $4.21 billion in 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Rochester-based photographic giant began a major restructuring in 1989, at 
a cost of $549 million. The company sold or consolidated about 20 businesses 
and eliminated 7,500 jobs. Chairman Colby Chandler has said he expects to see 
the restructuring translate into better earnings and improved cash flows in the 
second half of 1990.

ECONOMY INDICATORS FOR MARCH RISE 0.9%; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: ECONOMISTS FEAR SLOWDOWN BECAUSE RISE IN INFLATION ISN'T ENOUGH TO 
ENCOURAGE FED TO LOWER INTEREST RATES.

<TEXT>
<P>
The government's chief economic forecasting gauge rose 0.9% in March, its 
biggest increase in nearly two years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The gain in the index of leading economic indicators, designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months in the future, means the gauge nearly 
regained the 1% loss it suffered in February. 
</P>
<P>
It was the steepest increase since a 1.6% gain in June, 1988. Before dropping 
in February, the index had risen three straight months. 
</P>
<P>
But while the gauge was up in March, some analysts were concerned that rising 
inflation, if it does not force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, 
certainly will not encourage the central bank to lower them. 
</P>
<P>
High rates would slow further the already sluggish construction, auto and 
manufacturing sectors of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a slowdown in activity in the second and third quarters due 
primarily to high interest rates," said Paul Getman, an economist with Regional 
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have an extremely sluggish construction sector and lackluster activity 
elsewhere, including business investment, which has been pretty good," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, construction, which relies on low-cost loans, slowed even before the 
start of the second quarter. The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that 
construction spending dropped 1.4% in March, its steepest decline in more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 11 forward-looking statistics contributed to the increase in today's 
leading indicators, led by a gain in new plant and equipment orders. 
</P>
<P>
Other positives were an increase in the price of raw materials, an increase in 
orders for consumer goods, higher stock prices, slower business delivery times 
and a drop in weekly unemployment claims. 
</P>
<P>
Negatives included a decrease in building permits, a decline in the backlog of 
manufacturers' unfilled orders and a drop in the money supply. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the components were unchanged: the average workweek and an index 
measuring consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Although many analysts see slow growth ahead, there is virtual unanimity that 
the economy has avoided a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"The business cycle trough is pretty much behind us," contended Kermit Baker, 
director of economics at Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. "Any risk of 
recession pretty much ended with the first-quarter (GNP) report. You're not 
going to hear too many recession forecasts cropping up over the next few 
months." 
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter gross national product -- the nation's total output of goods 
and services -- rose 2.1%, compared to a 3% increase for all of 1989, according 
to a Commerce Department report last week. 
</P>
<P>
That was much stronger growth than many economists had predicted as the year 
began. At that time, many forecast GNP growth would be little improved from the 
fourth quarter's 1.1% rate, the slowest in three years. Some even said the 
economy could topple into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the surprising strength, the report also contained bad news on the 
inflation front -- a 6.5% annual rate, the steepest increase since 1981 and up 
sharply from the 4.5% in 1989.

Now there's going to be even more Simpsons on the small screen. Acclaim 
Entertainment Inc. announced today that it has acquired exclusive rights to 
manufacture Nintendo video games featuring the wildly popular Bart Simpson and 
his cartoon family. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Holmes, president of Acclaim, said the value of the licensing deal "is 
amplified by the fact that young adults feel a strong attachment to both 'The 
Simpsons' and the video gaming world. By joining the two together, we 
anticipate the result to be an incredibly powerful product." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the family of characters created by cartoonist Matt Groening, the Fox 
Network series draws high Nielsen ratings from a broad range of age groups 
including the core Nintendo customers -- 8- to 16-year-olds. A hand-held 
Simpsons game is expected this fall.

WILLIAMS' SON APPEALS AWARD TO HALF SISTER

Country music star Hank Williams Jr. has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to strike 
down "feel-good jurisprudence" that gave his half sister a claim to the estate 
of their famous father. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' lawyers contended in the filing that the state Supreme Court gave a 
share of the late country music Hank Williams Sr.'s estate to his illegitimate 
daughter, Jett Williams, even though the estate had been closed since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also asked the court to hear an appeal of a New York appeals court 
that, relying on the Alabama case, gave Jett Williams a share of continuing 
music royalties stemming from songs written by her father. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams Sr. died five days before his daughter was born in 1953 to Bobbie 
Jett. The Alabama court noted that her paternity was not suggested to her until 
1974, when she was a 21-year-old University of Alabama student. 
</P>
<P>
For the next few years, her efforts to get documents from the state were 
thwarted because the case had been sealed, along with evidence that lawyers had 
been setting aside part of Hank Williams Sr.'s estate for her. 
</P>
<P>
She launched her music career under the name Jett Williams, although she is 
identified in court documents as Catherine Yvonne Stone.

BRITON ACCUSED OF THREATENING FORMER BEATLE;

<P>
A man who allegedly sent threatening letters to George Harrison was arrested 
today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old ex-Beatle received the letters at his mansion in Friar Park 
near Henley, 35 miles west of central London, where he lives with his wife and 
son. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mirror reported that Harrison has been haunted by fear of an 
assassin's bullet ever since another former Beatle, John Lennon, was slain in 
1980. Harrison is constantly accompanied by a bodyguard, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Thames Valley police swooped down on a South London address to detain the man 
after an examination of the letters' postmarks found they were all sent from 
that area, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have traced the person who sent the letters. Papers will be submitted for 
consideration for prosecution," said a police spokesman, who was not identified 
in keeping with British custom. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Harrison had received five anonymous handwritten 
letters in recent weeks threatening death. 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid said one of the letters stated, "Time you went," and another said, 
"Goodbye, George." 
</P>
<P>
Lennon was slain outside his Manhattan apartment by a deranged gunman Dec. 8, 
1980. The rock music group broke up in 1970 after eight years of success.

Crown Prince Naruhito. Prince Aya, who graduated from Gakushuin University in 
1988, is studying zoology at Oxford's St. John's College in Britain. Aya and 
Kawashima met five years ago on the campus of Gakushuin University. Kawashima, 
the daughter of a Gakushuin professor, is taking graduate courses in psychology

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: EASE POCKETBOOK PAIN FOR PATIENTS TESTING NEW DRUGS

Question: My next-door neighbor is retired and very frugal. She was given a 
prescription for Ceclor for an infection. The price was astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, she only took it for a short time before developing 
diarrhea and a rash. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctor gave her a new prescription, but she was out the money for the 
Ceclor. Why can't doctors prescribe just two or three days' worth to start 
with? If the patient can handle it they can get the medicine refilled. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Physicians should provide patients with a few days' worth of free 
samples whenever they prescribe a new medicine. This will allow patients to 
tell if they can tolerate the drug before spending a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
If that is not possible, the next best thing would be to have the pharmacist 
dispense only a small amount of the medicine and get it refilled if there are 
no serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am looking for a natural diet aid. The health food herbalist recommended 
spirulina. Can you tell me how effective it is for losing weight? 
</P>
<P>
A: Spirulina is blue-green algae -- sort of like pond scum. Some promoters 
claim it will boost energy and help people lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 the Food and Drug Administration concluded that there is no evidence 
that blue-green algae is effective for weight loss. Although this stuff is high 
in protein and minerals, it is an expensive way to supplement the diet. Until 
we see a well-controlled study we would not recommend any kind of algae for 
quick weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell me about Ansaid? My mother has just started taking it for 
arthritis, and now she says she is free of pain. Is this pain reliever 
addicting? 
</P>
<P>
A: Ansaid (flurbiprofen) is a relatively new arthritis medication. Like most 
other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) this type of medicine 
reduces inflammation and swelling in the joints as well as relieving pain. 
NSAIDs are not addicting, but they do have side effects, including stomach 
irritation, ulceration, diarrhea, headache, skin rash, and kidney problems.

LIZ SMITH: HEPBURN GETS ESTIMATED $4.25 MILLION TO TELL ALL

LISTEN CAREFULLY -- $4.25 million. This is the Publishers Weekly estimate of 
the advance being paid to Katharine Hepburn for her coming memoir, "Me." Knopf 
hopes to publish Kate's book next spring, while the company's president, Sonny 
Mehta, says, "I don't want to rush Miss Hepburn." 
</P>
<P>
This could be the highest sum ever paid to any public figure to tell us all 
about it in print. And even if Miss Hepburn doesn't "tell all" -- which would 
be like her -- she'll tell enough, and it should be worth it. The four-time 
Oscar winner has long resisted writing intimately about her life. Now she will. 
</P>
<P>
Although the great Kate was hospitalized last week for surgery on the ankle she 
injured several years ago in a car accident, she is in fine spirits. She has 
told producer Alexander Cohen that she'll definitely serve as one of the hosts 
for this Saturday's massive "Night of 100 Stars III" to benefit the Actors 
Fund, even if she has to show up on stage on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the welfare of fellow actors, the show must go on!

THAT CAT with nine lives -- Elizabeth Taylor -- is making such progress that 
she may be released from St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica by the end of this 
week. Her doctors are cautious, but the violet-eyed phoenix never has been much 
of one for caution. 
</P>
<P>
The star's near-fatal bout with pneumonia has had some positive side effects. 
She received a worldwide wave of love and sympathy that reversed her almost 
two-year backslide. 
</P>
<P>
The illness has cemented her strong relationship with her companion, 
37-year-old construction worker Larry Fortensky, who has been called "a brick, 
a tower of strength." Despite the age and status difference, Elizabeth seems to 
have found herself a regular guy who is loyal. 
</P>
<P>
Miss T. has already agreed to star in a movie for her old friend, British 
producer Norma Heyman, which is tentatively scheduled to begin next September 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN JACKIE Mason opens his third return engagement at the Public Theater in 
New York on May 5 for 11 performances, he'll include in his "try-out" such 
subjects as Bush and broccoli, Lithuania, Donald and Ivana Trump. Then Jackie 
will take his very special views on to Los Angeles and, finally, if all goes 
well, back to Broadway. This time the show is titled "Jackie Mason -- Brand 
New."

IN CASE you think Joan Collins is all washed up, consider this. Harrods and 
Selfridge's of Great Britain are battling for exclusive rights to sell her 
perfume, Spectacular. And it looks as if Selfridge's has won and she'll kick

</P>
<P>
You see, Joan is the third-most-talked about celebrity in England, with only 
Princess Diana and the Duchess of York running ahead of her.

Attorneys for "Tonight Show" host Johnny Carson on Tuesday called the demand

Arkin said in court papers that Joan and Johnny, who met in college at the 
University of Nebraska, have had virtually no contact for years. They were 
married in 1949, separated in 1959 and divorced in 1963. Carson, who is in his 
28th year of hosting the highly successful late-night talk show, is reportedly 
paid more than $6 million a year by NBC. Divorced three times, Carson currently 
is married.

According to court papers, Joan Carson, 61, lives at the Surrey Hotel on 
Manhattan's Upper East Side and can't afford to buy a home, although she puts 
her cash net worth at $388,000. "I don't have a home. I can't afford to buy a 
home. I can't live on this, and I've put this off much too long," she said.

Mats Wilander said today he will miss the French Open, which he has won three 
times, and probably won't play at Wimbledon either this year. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, the former No. 1 player who has dropped out of the top 10, said he 
hasn't played tennis since March and won't be in condition to compete in Paris 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I need at least two or three weeks hard training to compete. After that, 15 to 
20 matches are needed to reach peak form. Physically it would be impossible to 
play in Paris," Wilander said at a news conference publicizing his new 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, denying he is quitting the game, said he intends to stay on the 
circuit another two years. But he said he lacks motivation and is taking life 
easy. He lives in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not bored with being at home yet. Once I am, motivation will return and 
then I will start playing again." he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard when you have won so much, not to be able to win tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has committed himself to only one tournament this summer, the 
Swedish Open in Bastad.

ENGEL FACES 2ND COUNT OF SHOPLIFTING BASEBALL CARDS

<P>
National League umpire Bob Engel has been formally charged with a second count 
of shoplifting packs of baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney entered pleas of not guilty for Engel in Bakersfield Municipal 
Court Tuesday on both petty theft counts and on one count of commercial 
burglary stemming from Engel's arrest on April 21. 
</P>
<P>
After reports of the episode, the manager of Costco Warehouse told police that 
Engel tried to conceal 50 packs of baseball cards in his pockets last January. 
He was questioned after another customer tipped security officers, but Costco 
officials did not report the incident to police at that time. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that led to his arrest involved seven boxes of Score baseball 
cards, containing more than 4,000 cards worth $143.98, that were displayed in a 
store. Police said that Engel, a resident of Bakersfield, took the cards to a 
corner of the store and put them in a brown paper bag he pulled from the 
waistband of his pants. A security guard stopped Engel as he left. 
</P>
<P>
Engel, who has been a National League umpire since 1966, was indefinitely 
suspended by the league after his arrest, with the explanation that the 
suspension would allow him to devote full time to the charges. The league said 
the umpire agreed with the action. 
</P>
<P>
Engel has made no public comment since his arrest. His listed telephone has 
been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakersfield Californian reported that investigative reports filed in 
Municipal Court in the current cases state that Engel admitted to police that 
he was arrested for investigation of shoplifting videocassette tapes in 1986. 
However, the newspaper found no court record of that case and said law 
enforcement officials explained that records can be expunged if a misdemeanor 
offender completes a diversion program.

<P>
Cot Campbell, president of Dogwood Stable, said not all the partners would 
attend the Derby, but there would be a group of 25, including spouses.

SUMMER SQUALL'S PAST SHOWS TOUGHNESS THAT CAN WEATHER STORMS

<P>
His 2-year-old season was shortened by a hairline fracture of the cannon bone, 
and he bled heavily after a workout earlier this year. He could stand to gain 
some weight, and he's run three races in the past 1 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't sound like much of a horse, but he's won seven of eight career starts. 
His name is Summer Squall, and he'll be one of the favorites in Saturday's 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never been a big, strapping horse . . . and he looks littler sometimes 
because he doesn't carry a lot of weight," said Cot Campbell, head of the 
Dogwood syndicate that owns Summer Squall. "But he's got a great engine." 
</P>
<P>
Either Summer Squall or the unbeaten Mister Frisky, winner of a North 
American-record 16 in a row including the Santa Anita Derby, will be favored 
when 15 to 17 3-year-olds are entered on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the field will be Gotham and Wood Memorial winner Thirty Six Red, 
Arkansas Derby winner Silver Ending, Florida Derby winner Unbridled, and three 
colts trained by D. Wayne Lukas -- Land Rush, Real Cash and Power Lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Summer Squall's twisting road to the Derby, his trainer, Neil Howard, 
says his colt is "coming up excellent." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't do anything different," he said. "He had a little bit of a tight 
campaign, but we had to grab what was available. I'm very happy with the way 
things have gone, and if he runs a good race, I'll be thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall worked a half mile in 48 2/5 last Saturday, and Howard said he 
would breeze him again today. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall was part of a five-horse package offered by Dogwood Farm at 
$55,900 each for 40 shares. Twenty-eight people bought those shares and now are 
considered his owners, although Campbell has broad power to administer the 
syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall was unbeaten in five starts as a 2-year-old when he was sidelined 
the rest of the year by the cannon fracture in August. Then, after a workout in 
February, he came off the track bleeding from the nose. Campbell believes the 
bleeding was caused by a fungus, and there has been no recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
The bleeding, however, interrupted his training, and he didn't make his 
3-year-old debut until March 17 in the Swale at Gulfstream Park, where he lost 
for the only time in his career. He was beaten by a length over seven furlongs 
by the ace sprinter, Housebuster. He followed that with victories in the Jim 
Beam and Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
"Neil called me on Feb. 19," Campbell recalled. "I said, 'How's things?' and he 
said, 'Not good. He bled.' I was flabbergasted. There was never any indication 
it was coming. I remember the feeling. It was not a jolly time." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell called the bleeding significant. Bleeding is fairly common among 
thoroughbreds, but normally it is internal and can be detected only through 
tests. This blood was visible. 
</P>
<P>
"But he didn't get sick. He was bright that day. He bled, but he didn't know 
it," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he ran so well in the Swale, it was almost like our Triple Crown," 
Campbell said. "We were ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Probably because of the three quick races this spring, Summer Squall lost 
weight. Campbell guessed he was down to about 950 pounds, and Howard said he 
had Summer Squall on a special feeding program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see 25 or 30 more pounds on him," Campbell said, "but he has added 
some since the Blue Grass. His coat looks good, and he's full of gusto." 
</P>
<P>
The Dogwood syndicate purchased Summer Squall at the Keeneland select yearling 
sale in 1988 for $300,000. Since then, he's earned $785,078.

GLICKMAN REALTY IS LEAVING THE WESTSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: A SLUGGISH MARKET AND STIFF COMPETITION MOVE FOUNDER TO CLOSE 
BRENTWOOD OFFICE AND ONE THAT OPENED IN BEVERLY HILLS A FEW WEEKS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 2 1/2 years after its highly publicized launch into the Westside, Mike 
Glickman Realty Inc. of Woodland Hills said Tuesday that it is closing its 
Brentwood and Beverly Hills offices. 
</P>
<P>
The residential real estate firm founded by Mike Glickman, a brash, 30-year-old 
entrepreneur who began his real estate career at age 15, grew to dominate home 
sales in the San Fernando Valley during the 1980s. But competitors in recent 
months have claimed that Glickman's large Brentwood office, which opened with 
much fanfare in November, 1987, had not lived up to expectations and was losing 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills office was opened just a few weeks ago. Glickman said the 
decision had already been made to pull back from the Westside, but he went 
ahead with the opening because financial commitments had already been made. 
</P>
<P>
About 120 agents will be laid off as a result of the office closures, and 
another 15% of the firm's 1,600-agent work force will be laid off over the next 
several months, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman blamed the closings, which took effect Tuesday, partly on the home 
sales market, which has slowed considerably since the heady days of 1987 and 
1988. When the Brentwood office was opened, he said, the market was booming and 
the affluent, rapidly appreciating Westside seemed the obvious place to expand. 
</P>
<P>
"But as the market slowed down, we realized that without having a multi-office 
chain in the Westside, we weren't going to penetrate the market as we had in 
the Valley," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman, an unabashed self-promoter who until Tuesday denied that the Westside 
offices were in trouble, also admitted that the expansion failed partly because 
of his own tunnel vision. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally might have gotten caught up in the excitement of the '80s, when 
bigger seemed to be better," Glickman said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman also said that since he turned 30 on March 12 he's had time to reflect 
on his past strategy. "It's time to change," he said. "Now I want quality 
instead of quantity." 
</P>
<P>
Just a few months ago, Glickman denied in an interview with The Times that he 
was considering closing the Brentwood office and canceling plans to open in 
Beverly Hills. In a copy of a companywide memo dated Feb. 5 that Glickman made 
available to The Times, Glickman told his employees: "Our expansion in the 
Westside has been very successful." He also said he planned to open more 
offices in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the Brentwood branch, with more than 100 agents and a large, 
high-profile office on Wilshire Blvd., was criticized by many of Glickman's 
competitors when it opened for being overly ambitious. During an interview with 
The Times shortly after the office opened for business, Glickman said he 
planned to launch an office "in every major market in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kaplan, who manages the 90-agent Fred Sands Realtors office in Beverly 
Hills, said Glickman's pullback from the Westside had long been foreseen. "As 
he looks back, he'll see he should have done things differently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said Glickman is known for hiring large numbers of agents, many of whom 
have little training. The tony Beverly Hills and Brentwood communities require 
a very specialized type of service, he said, with clients expecting more 
hand-holding by agents. "I don't think the Westside brokers thought his 
approach would be successful on the Westside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Douglas, chairman of Beverly Hills-based Jon Douglas Co., one of the 
Westside's largest residential real estate brokerages, said he was somewhat 
surprised at Glickman's announcement because Glickman had achieved success so 
quickly in the Valley. But, he said, on the Westside "you just don't take 
10,000-square-foot offices and hire a bunch of agents. You have to be a little 
more focused." 
</P>
<P>
Glickman said the Brentwood office was profitable in the beginning, when the 
market was booming, but it "has been a financial drain on me for well over 1 
1/2 years." 
</P>
<P>
However, Glickman denied rumors that his company was experiencing financial 
difficulties and that he was having trouble obtaining financing. "Financially, 
our only problem was trying to keep the Westside office going," he said. "Now 
we're back in a total profit mode." 
</P>
<P>
Glickman also said Tuesday that his two Sherman Oaks offices have been 
consolidated and the company's fledgling 46-broker commercial real estate 
division, which was to be based in the Beverly Hills office, will now be run 
from Glickman's headquarters in Woodland Hills. The company now has five 
offices, including a recently opened branch in the Conejo Valley. Glickman said 
he plans to open a Studio City office within a year and also hopes to expand 
into the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman said about 30 of his 150 Westside agents will relocate to the Valley, 
and he said he didn't know if he would ever again attempt such an ambitious 
expansion. "Right now I'm only interested in doing what I do best, which is the 
San Fernando Valley," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND Starting in the real estate business at age 15 by delivering flyers 
for local real estate agents, Mike Glickman rose quickly in the 1980s to become 
a dominant force in the Valley home sales market. At age 18, he joined Jerry 
Berns &amp; Associates as a sales agent, and in 1983 he started his own 
company, Mike Glickman Realty Inc. in Woodland Hills. Today, Glickman, 30, 
employs 1,600 agents in five offices in the San Fernando and Conejo valleys.

Lazaro Barrera, keeper of the unbeaten flame known as Mister Frisky, has been 
through two heart surgeries, three countries and nearly every peak and valley 
in almost 50 years as a thoroughbred trainer. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing prepared the ebullient Barrera for the emotional roller-coaster 
ride of the last 15 months. From the depths of a physically debilitating 
depression to the giddy heights of national acclaim, the 65-year-old native of 
Cuba has survived the worst-case scenario of racing's arcane regulations to 
emerge on the threshold of a possible third Kentucky Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera has been holding court at Churchill Downs for the past week, putting 
the finishing touches on Mister Frisky's Derby preparation. The chestnut colt 
with the 16-for-16 record won the Santa Anita Derby on April 7 to place himself 
alongside Summer Squall as co-favorite to win the 116th Derby in Louisville, 
Ky. But it has been Barrera, one of the best-known trainers of the modern era, 
who commands just as much of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
A son of a Havana quarter-horse jockey, Barrera has won the Derby twice, with 
Bold Forbes in 1976 and with Triple Crown winner Affirmed in 1978. He has 
trained nearly 150 stakes winners, statistical territory occupied only by the 
likes of Charlie Whittingham, Wayne Lukas and Woody Stephens. He led North 
American trainers from 1977 through '80, and in 1979 he became the first Latino 
to be elected to racing's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, though, Barrera's pre-Derby interviews this time around have turned 
to the events of early 1989, when his name was linked to the alleged discovery 
of cocaine in the post-race urine samples of six Southern California 
thoroughbreds. Barrera was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, but the 
process was traumatic -- not only for the trainer, but for the entire racing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the cocaine controversies, the California Horse Racing Board was 
criticized by the Legislature, which funds its annual budget of about $8 
million. The seven CHRB commissioners have taken several steps to bring order 
out of the chaos, but the fact remains that Barrera and the other accused 
trainers have gone through public torment. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't think what Laz went through was positive in any respect," 
said Dr. Rick Arthur, a race track veterinarian who has been an activist in 
reforming the state's post-race testing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't think we necessarily had to go through that to get where we are 
today. I think what happened to him was a reaction by the CHRB staff that they 
felt they had to show they were doing something. Unfortunately, it showed 
exactly what we'd contended all along -- that they didn't know what they were 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to Laz was the point of no return. After that, the commissioners 
could no longer drag their feet about the problems in the drug-testing 
procedure. There was no confidence in their negative tests, just as there was 
no confidence in their positive tests." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the botched cocaine accusations, the racing board reduced the 
power of its executive staff and added an equine medical director to the 
process of evaluating all post-race test results. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a second laboratory was contracted to run parallel tests on 
post-race samples, using advanced technology. At the same time, procedures in 
the collection of post-race samples have been tightened, and referee samples 
are being split off to give trainers a separate specimen to conduct independent 
tests if an illegal substance is discovered by the official lab. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera said he welcomes the changes, especially if they protect the innocent. 
But nothing will erase the memory of Feb. 10, 1989, when the trainer was told 
by the Santa Anita Board of Stewards that one of his horses, a colt named 
Endow, tested positive for a small amount of cocaine after a retest of a frozen 
urine sample taken more than five months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Barrera still was reeling from the announcement just two days 
earlier that his son, Albert, had a filly that allegedly tested positive for 
cocaine after a race on Feb. 2. Two other trainers -- Anthony Hemmerick and 
Bryan Webb -- were similarly implicated. On Feb. 10, it also was revealed that 
Wayne Lukas' colt, Crown Collection, was flagged for what the lab called a 
cocaine positive, based on a retest of a frozen specimen. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Leonard Foote, executive secretary of the CHRB, brought 
formal charges against Barrera and the others, based on a racing rule that 
holds trainers ultimately responsible for everything involving their horses. 
They all faced the same six-month suspension and $2,000 fine that was levied 
against trainer Roger Stein in October, 1988, when his horse, Emperor's Turn, 
was alleged to have tested positive for cocaine. At the time of the new 
incidents, Stein received a stay of his penalties and was in the midst of an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements triggered a firestorm of protests and recriminations. Foote, 
the board's spokesman and chief investigative officer, was accused of acting 
precipitously. Truesdail Laboratories, the official testing firm, was accused 
of shabby procedures. Paranoia spread among trainers, who feared either 
sabotage or contamination of post-race samples. And the cynics in the media and 
on the backstretch had a field day. 
</P>
<P>
"No wonder Barrera and Lukas win so many races," went the wise guy line. "Their 
horses are flying." 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, the charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to pressure from the state attorney general's office, which 
essentially saw the cases as unwinnable if challenged in court, Foote took the 
trainers and the board off the hook by citing a lack of evidence based on "the 
accepted standard for the identification of cocaine." In other words, the rules 
were changed after the game was well under way. 
</P>
<P>
Truesdail, now bidding for a renewal of its testing contract, continues to 
stand by its original findings. Dr. Norman Hester, Truesdail's technical 
director, has repeatedly stated that their analysis was based on existing 
guidelines and their results were confirmed by the equine drug-testing facility 
at Ohio State University. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barrera and his attorney, Donald Calabria, maintain that the only way 
cocaine could have been found in a urine sample taken from the trainer's horse 
was through outside contamination. According to Calabria, extensive independent 
tests conducted at the University of Utah revealed no cocaine in the specimen 
taken from Endow. The same negative result, the attorney said, was obtained for 
the Lukas horse. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Barrera has sued Truesdail for $25 million in damages, although 
the lab reportedly carries barely $500,000 in liability protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the money," Barrera said earlier this year as he 
contemplated the suit. "If a lab can do this to me, they can do it to anybody. 
Let them go out of business. Let them use their building for the homeless 
people to sleep in." 
</P>
<P>
Barrera, known for his ready sense of humor and an endless round of tall tales 
from his colorful past, was serious. During his period in limbo -- between the 
Feb. 10 announcement and the May 30 dismissals -- he became alarmingly morose, 
and his health deteriorated drastically. 
</P>
<P>
A robust 6-footer, Barrera dropped as much as 30 pounds. His diabetic condition 
became aggravated, threatening his vision. His doctor warned him that the 
combination of stress, depression and exhaustion was taking its toll on a heart 
that had gone through bypass surgery in 1979 and a bypass replacement in '84. 
</P>
<P>
"He took it too hard," recalled Carmen Barrera, Lazaro's wife of 40 years. "It 
was like watching him die a little bit at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Hal King, a fellow trainer who first met Barrera in Mexico City 36 years ago, 
was not surprised that the cocaine allegations weighed so heavily on his 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very prideful man, and for his entire life the only important things to 
him have been his horses and his family," said King, who retired from training 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He had trained for 46 years in three different countries without so much as a 
single ruling against him . . . and considered himself a role model for Latin 
American people everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"So when this (cocaine) thing came out, it just about destroyed him. The most 
difficult thing to do is prove your innocence. And on top of that, he became 
paranoid about even the people he knew. If somebody didn't talk to him, he 
would think, 'Do they think I really gave my horse cocaine?' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Barrera, whose daughter, Blanchita, is married to a Mexico City attorney: 
"In Mexico, there was even an article accusing me of using cocaine. Kids were 
asking my grandchildren about their grandfather and cocaine. Can you imagine 
how that made me feel? I was so embarrassed, I wanted to die." 
</P>
<P>
On the professional side, Barrera's stable was already struggling when the 
cocaine allegations surfaced. He lost his major client in December, 1988, when 
Oregon lumberman Aaron Jones decided to hire a private trainer. The 
once-flourishing Barrera barn was down to about 20 horses, very few of them 
stakes-class and many owned all or in part by Barrera himself. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Garcia, Barrera's assistant at the time, attempted to keep the staff 
running smoothly while the boss coped with the CHRB accusations and their 
aftermath, but morale around the barn clearly suffered. At year's end, the 
Barrera horses had won only 31 races and earned just $1,562,562, his lowest 
total since 1973, when he first made the North American top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Mister Frisky came into Barrera's life. The Florida-bred colt won his 
first 13 races for owners Jose and Marta Fernandez in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
then was shipped to Barrera at Santa Anita in January. For Barrera, Mister 
Frisky was a four-legged miracle tonic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm alive again," said Barrera, who never dodges a chance to be dramatic. "And 
I don't hold anything against the racing board. But you know something? Nobody 
has ever come up to me and said, 'I'm sorry we did this to you.' Nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Foote, who retired in February, sympathizes with Barrera. 
</P>
<P>
"But the one thing that can't be done, because there are lawsuits all over the 
place, is to say, 'I'm sorry,' " Foote said this week from his Sacramento home. 
"That's an expression that would imply there was some negligence involved. And 
actually, there was not. The one basic error made throughout was that no one 
had ever established a standard for what constitutes a positive. And California 
is not alone in this." 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarian Arthur, on the other hand, said the reason for the cocaine 
controversy is not that simple. He and several colleagues in the Horsemen's 
Benevolent and Protective Assn. maintain that there was and is an ongoing 
threat of cocaine entering the system of racehorses and that the racing board 
of 15 months ago was not equipped to respond to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Trainers do have to be very afraid of cocaine positives, because it is a drug 
of abuse," Arthur said. "There's always the potential of personnel in the barn 
getting involved with something like that. When Laz said, 'If I've ever touched 
cocaine, you can cut off my hand,' undoubtedly he meant it. The investigations 
should have been looking elsewhere all the time, but because of the trainer 
insurer (responsibility) rule, the trainer was the focal point." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur is confident that the system has been changed to prevent a recurrence of 
the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is now being overseen by someone in an independent scientific 
manner," he said. "The entire process is under constant review. Procedures have 
been implemented that would prevent someone being accused publicly before all 
the facts are in. These are things that the HBPA was recommending for a long 
time, and I think it will end up positive in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't think Laz had to be embarrassed the way he was," Arthur 
concluded. "I think the whole thing demonstrated exactly what we had been 
talking about -- that the California Horse Racing Board drug-testing program 
was a disaster waiting to happen. And it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, ridden by Gary Stevens, worked five furlongs Tuesday in 1:01 
4/5. The Santa Anita Derby winner, who will be ridden by Stevens in the 
Kentucky Derby, finished especially strong, covering the last eighth of a mile 
in :11 2/5. "That's the way you win the race," trainer Laz Barrera said. . . . 
Unbridled, the Florida Derby winner, worked in the same time. . . . The track 
was fast before heavy rain made it sloppy for the races in the afternoon. . . . 
More rain is possible through Friday. The forecast Saturday is for clearing, 
with no rain and temperatures in the 60s.

Listen to the grandfather: "I remember my first baseball glove. Cost me $2.9 -- 
and I saved more than four months to get it." Imagine him back then, a black 
and poor teenager in Tennessee during the early 1930s, having fallen in love 
with academics and athletics but knowing neither would be possible beyond high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to the son: "I was a high school all-American halfback (in 1960). Had 
about 75 or 80 scholarship offers. Yet I could not go to college in the 
southeastern or southwestern portions of this country." See him now, prosperous 
from sport, a member of three National Football League championship teams and 
in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to the grandson: "My dream is to play baseball professionally." An 
infielder, like his grandfather, he can climb as high as his abilities allow on 
the field. Off it, will he be able to run the team for whom he ran? 
</P>
<P>
So often the evolution of America's playground gets explained only in weighty 
and complicated ways. Franchise movement. Race relations. Free agency. Salary 
escalation. Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
What if we could examine most of those issues and concepts through some 
flesh-and-blood humans who experienced them? What if we got lucky and found 
three generations of a single family that could tie 60-some years of sport 
together simply by talking about themselves? 
</P>
<P>
Spend some time with the Warfields of central and northeastern Ohio and the 
abstract comes alive. Sadness for 74-year-old Dryden Warfield and hope for 
17-year-old Malcolm Warfield. Denial, opportunity and glory for the link, Paul 
Warfield, a son and a father at 47. 
</P>
<P>
As the Warfield story unfolds, from Dryden to Paul and to Malcolm, so do the 
attitudes Americans have about sports -- and about ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Six decades ago, major league baseball was a small triangular slice of the 
United States, extending from Boston to St. Louis, back to Washington, D.C., 
and up the East Coast. The National Football League was a loose collection of 
teams that included the Milwaukee Badgers and Staten Island Stapletons. Pro 
basketball was even less stable. Worse for Dryden Warfield, the chalky lines on 
his field of dreams might as well have been barricades. 
</P>
<P>
In the den of a home in Columbus that would be elegant in all but a few 
neighborhoods nationwide, Paul Warfield used his wide receiver's hands to 
illustrate progress from generation to generation to generation. 
</P>
<P>
My father's chances were this limited, he said, one palm almost touching the 
other. My chances had improved this much, he went on, spreading his hands 
perhaps two feet apart. Malcolm's chances are this grand, he was pleased to 
acknowledge by throwing his hands almost as far apart as they would go. Only 
upper management positions in corporations, and corporate sport, still are 
limited for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the first players in the National Football League paid enough not 
to have to work in the offseason," Paul Warfield said, adding with a smile that 
the rookie salary, in 1964, that made leisure an option was $20,000. This 
season, 27 major league baseball players will earn at least $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie in the 1930s was a town of about 1,500 split both by race and the 
Kentucky-Tennessee border. Dryden Warfield was born and raised on the Tennessee 
side. Anticipating a girl, his parents had decided on the name Lena Dryden 
weeks before his birth and stuck with it, Dryden being the first name of the 
doctor who delivered his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"We were baseball crazy," Dryden said. "Played baseball on Christmas if the 
weather was nice. Baseball. Baseball. I didn't think I could love anything more 
than baseball, until I got into football." 
</P>
<P>
That came later, in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was segregated," Dryden said. "But, really and truthfully, where we 
were from, whites and blacks got along. Never diehard segregation like in the 
Deep South. Everything amiable as long as you took care of your own affairs. 
You knew your road; you took that." 
</P>
<P>
At age 12 or 13, Dryden knew he had to have the baseball glove that all but 
crooked a leather finger at him from the window of a store offering things both 
practical and dreamy. To a youngster, a glove is a necessity of life; to Ed 
Warfield, trying to support a wife and 10 children on a railroad yardman's pay, 
it might as well have been the Hope Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it a little before Christmas," Dryden said. "Think I finally bought it 
early in April. If you wanted something, well, you put the money back and 
waited until you got enough. I worked at real little jobs. White people wanted 
you to do this, that and the other." 
</P>
<P>
With that glove, Dryden and his buddies occasionally played white teams. Twice 
a year at least. So even then some barriers in sport were stretched, if nowhere 
close to broken. Never was Dryden at shortstop able to look to his right and 
see a white third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Harder to deal with than baseball and race for Dryden was baseball and 
religion. That was a black-and-white issue on which most blacks and whites 
agreed: no sport on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that in the mid '20s and early '30s much of America was rural and 
small town, connected in large part by the railroad and the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
Until he left for work in Warren, Ohio, in early October 1936, Dryden never 
ventured more than 20 miles from Guthrie. His daily routine as a youngster was 
nearly as confined, weekdays being for school and baseball and Sundays for 
morning and evening worship. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how boys are," said Dryden, about to explain small devilment. 
"Sundays (after noon) were our free day. One time, I might have been 12 or so, 
six or seven of us went down Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed. The experience, still vivid, might only have been three quarters of 
a mile from home, but that's what youngsters from the Tennessee side called it. 
Down Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Dryden and his buddies this Sunday afternoon came upon some other boys 
playing baseball -- and everyone was having a fine time. His friends wondered: 
Can anything so pure and pleasurable as baseball ever be a sin? They decided no 
and, with some coaxing, Dryden shortly joined them. 
</P>
<P>
Dryden was a fine player, a right-handed-hitting shortstop with power, 
something on the order of a shorter and slightly more compact Ernie Banks. 
Quietly, he offered a comparison with his son, considered a major league 
prospect 30 years later before choosing pro football: "Paul never could hit a 
ball as far as I could." 
</P>
<P>
That Sunday, Dryden was powerless in every way you could imagine. Powerless 
against temptation; powerless at bat. 
</P>
<P>
"Popup, groundout," he said, mystified to this day. "That wasn't my nature. It 
looked like something was in the way. I couldn't concentrate. Just something 
about Sunday ball. It was bred in me." 
</P>
<P>
Boys being boys even when they officially are young men, Dryden gave Sunday 
baseball another go several years later, at about age 18. He fared fairly well 
in two games, but had run out on his duties with the church choir to play in 
them. Ed Warfield talked with his son one evening and said a decision had to be 
made: quit the church or quit baseball. The choice being so rigidly either-or, 
Dryden said: "I never played any more baseball on Sunday." Which mostly 
explains why Paul Warfield has no memories of Dryden Warfield at play. 
</P>
<P>
When he went to high school, he became infatuated with a new game called 
football. "I fell in love with it," he said. "Because of the contact. Boy 
against boy; muscle against muscle." 
</P>
<P>
Football was 12 miles from home, that being the distance to the closest black 
high school in Tennessee, Burt, named for the man who financed its 
construction. Monday through Friday, Dryden would ride a Louisville &amp; 
Nashville train to and from the Clarksville school. 
</P>
<P>
During three years with the Burt varsity, Dryden played left guard on offense, 
then stayed along the line of scrimmage and played left guard on defense. 
Bursts of the kind of speed Paul would flash for the Cleveland Browns and Miami 
Dolphins during a dozen seasons in the NFL were frequent enough for Dryden to 
drop off into pass coverage now and then. 
</P>
<P>
"All that was wrong with football was that the season was too short," he said. 
"After Thanksgiving, it was over. I just hated to see Thanksgiving come." 
</P>
<P>
Much more upsetting was the end of high school, in 1934, for it ended not only 
sports for Dryden but also the education he had taken to with almost as much 
enthusiasm. His father had been retired two years earlier; his seven older 
brothers and sisters had left home. Still, Ed's railroad pension was not nearly 
enough to keep the dwindling family going without help. No way was college an 
option, although Dryden did take time to talk with his high school principal 
about finding one. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," he said. "We were too poor. Just couldn't do it. I couldn't 
go." Had the times not been so tough, Dryden would have followed the rail line 
to Nashville and attended Tennessee State or Fisk. Football? Dryden Warfield 
didn't even own one. 
</P>
<P>
"After high school," he said, "there was no work. Period. It was just a matter 
of trying to exist, really. If something didn't happen to pass through, or some 
job was created, well, you just didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
An older brother, William, had gone to Warren and gotten a job with Republic 
Steel. In the summer of 1936, home on vacation, he told Dryden steadier work in 
the mill at far better pay was available. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of months later, two years out of high school, Dryden and his new 
wife, Omelia, took the train about 550 miles and joined William in the Ohio 
mill town near the Pennsylvania border. Twenty-four years in the future, 
Dryden's son would bring a small measure of lasting fame to Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at Guthrie, Dryden said: "My life doesn't sound exciting. But I 
had a great time. I had a great childhood. There just wasn't the money." 
</P>
<P>
Half a generation before Jackie Robinson broke the color line in the major 
leagues, there was opportunity for young blacks in pro baseball. And many a fan 
in Guthrie pegged Dryden Warfield as a future star in the Negro league. 
</P>
<P>
"But those teams were far away," he said. "And I don't think I would have liked 
the lifestyle. Eating and sleeping on buses. Up all night and playing the next 
day (including Sunday). I was comfortable at home. That way of living wouldn't 
have suited me at all." 
</P>
<P>
Dryden chooses to look more kindly on Guthrie and its ways than Paul. The son 
recalled his first time there, in the early '50s, when he was about 11. Inside 
a movie theater, striding toward front row center, he had his arm gently tugged 
by a cousin. We must go this way, he was told. Upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
The father shook his head and said, as that memory and another flashed into his 
mind: "I used to clean up that theater." It was one of the ways he stayed 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of of 1959 and the winter of 1960, Woody Hayes and lots of coaches 
only slightly less famous made their way east on Park Street in Warren, Ohio, 
turned right on Federal and immediately into a double-car driveway. Inside a 
small house, they all but begged Paul Warfield to accept their offer of a 
college scholarship -- courtesy of football. What sweet irony that was to 
Dryden, for whom structured sport and formal education had not been possible 
after high school. 
</P>
<P>
By happy coincidence, the area that provided steady work and decent wages in 
the mid '30s for the father had, a quarter-century later, given the son maximum 
athletic exposure in high school. Elite Ohioans in football, baseball and track 
and field also crack the national who's who lists -- and Paul Warfield was 
exceptional in all three. 
</P>
<P>
"He got the love of the games from me," Dryden said. "His mother didn't care 
for sports. And my father had no athletic ability at all. Never thought of 
sports. Too busy trying to support his family." 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseball and football in the late '50s were becoming 
coast-to-coast businesses. Advances in airline travel were such that even 
Southern Cal felt there was a chance Paul would accept its offer of a football 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"But there was not the ghost of a chance I could consider schools like the 
University of Alabama," Paul Warfield said. "I recall very vividly Governor 
Wallace standing on the schoolhouse steps, defying a U.S. marshal (to admit 
black students). I was pretty much restricted, in big-time college football, to 
the area of the Big Ten." 
</P>
<P>
Dryden remembers a handwritten letter from Darrell Royal pitching the 
University of Texas, so the Deep South was not totally off-limits. But Paul 
felt most comfortable near home, with Woody Hayes and Ohio State. The Warfields 
turned down tempting offers from the Tigers, Indians and White Sox out of high 
school; Paul walked away from baseball his second spring in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the coach one of the reasons I wouldn't be playing baseball was because 
of a 14-day swing the team took each season through the Deep South," Paul said. 
"I said there's no way you can guarantee me I won't face an embarrassing 
situation. Or a threatening situation. As a youngster, I was terrified of the 
prospect of going into the Deep South." 
</P>
<P>
Paul's offseason sport at Ohio State was track and field, specifically the long 
jump. In 1962 he and a black sprinter from Purdue stayed in a dorm at the 
University of Houston while taking part in a meet prior to the NCAA outdoor 
championships. They thought little of it, until students at Texas Southern, 
with whom they visited while in town, made such a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
Warfield and his wife were denied an apartment that caught their fancy his 
first year as a professional football player, in Cleveland in 1964. He and 
three Browns teammates could not get their shoes shined in Birmingham two years 
later, even though the men who would be doing the job also were black. That and 
some other reasons were why his son would be named in honor of Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
Paul got his degree from Ohio State, but not until four years after he left. 
Dryden pushed him to earn the few remaining credits; the main motivation came 
from Hayes, who greeted his former star so similarly for Paul to think his name 
had been changed to Did You Graduate Yet. 
</P>
<P>
There was competition between the American and National leagues when Paul 
turned professional, although the big money started a year later, in 1965, when 
Joe Namath bestrode Broadway. Paul did hit football's lottery, about a decade 
later, when he, Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick bolted the Dolphins for a fling with 
Memphis of the quickly deflated World Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"My base salary was four times what I'd been getting" with the Dolphins after 
winning back-to-back Super Bowls, he said. "Here we were, three top players on 
the best team in the NFL and none of us was making six figures. And our bonuses 
were astronomical. We were in disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
So in addition to playing better than all but a benchful of players in the 
history of pro football, Warfield was among the few who had control, however 
briefly, of his career. But he also was traded, in 1970, from the Browns to a 
team that didn't exist when he turned pro, the Dolphins. And Miami "isn't 
exactly the Deep South." 
</P>
<P>
Since retiring in 1977, Warfield has worked in television and in personnel with 
the Browns and currently does commentary on Ohio State football. He owns a 
temporary-employment services business, which means he has an easier time 
attending Malcolm's games than Dryden had breaking free for his. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm began to fully appreciate his father when he watched him being inducted 
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Only 11, he had not realized Paul's 
immense impact on the NFL and it made being "son of" much easier to tolerate. 
But his sport of choice was baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Paul cannot recall his father in an athletic moment, mainly because Dryden 
often worked the night and overnight shifts at Republic. Saturday was for 
keeping up the house, Sunday devoted to church. Even if there had been time 
for, say, bowling, Paul recalls, they probably would not have been comfortable 
in many alleys. Also, fathers of Dryden's generation are not inclined to brag 
about themselves. Paul's exploits are as close to Malcolm as a tape popped into 
a VCR. 
</P>
<P>
For an 11th-grade speech required for graduation, Malcolm a few weeks ago chose 
life with a former NFL player and executive. The bright side was obvious, being 
around famous players, fooling around with the computer on Paul's desk that 
stored every salary in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I also talked about Don Rogers," the Browns safety whose death by drug-related 
causes came not long after Len Bias's in 1986, Malcolm said. "I was a big fan 
of his; my father and he were close. When he died, that showed me athletes 
really aren't immortal. I'd always thought of them as being superior to 
everyone else ... I really grew up after that." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up as an infielder majoring in third base just now, Malcolm is almost 
certain to be recruited heavily by college baseball teams. Only football and 
basketball scholarships were prevalent when Paul was a teenager; college 
baseball more and more is becoming an accepted path toward the majors -- and 
Deep South colleges unwilling to recruit Paul may be anxious to woo Malcolm. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm will be eligible to play as a freshman, the restrictive academic hurdle 
called Proposition 48 almost surely easy for him to leap over. In his college 
era, Paul could not play varsity sports as a freshman -- and is grateful for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
For Dryden Warfield, Paul's induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame was a 
proud day made more emotional because Omelia had passed away almost exactly 
seven years earlier. Still, fathers never strut quite so airily as when their 
sons excel in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all new then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dryden recalled walking through the parking lot after the Warren G. Harding 
Panthers of Warren had gone across the nearby Pennsylvania line and beaten a 
team from Sharon. To a Harding woman who did not know him, Dryden could not 
help teasing: "That Warfield isn't so great. He had a terrible game." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the woman all but went for his throat. How dare you say anything bad 
about Paul Warfield? She was white. 
</P>
<P>
Paul's middle name is Dryden, same as his father's; serious consideration is 
being given to changing Malcolm's middle name from Joseph to Dryden. Still 
firmly ensconced about 130 miles away in Warren, the grandfather stretches on 
an easy chair in his den and declares: "I am 74. My father was 99 years and 6 
months when he died. I hope to top him." 
</P>
<P>
That offers the chance for another Warfield generation, the fourth, to grow and 
mature. Who knows what wonders Dryden might find available for a 
great-grandchild.

Lazaro Barrera, keeper of the unbeaten flame known as Mister Frisky, has been 
through two heart surgeries, three countries and nearly every peak and valley 
in almost 50 years as a thoroughbred trainer. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing prepared the ebullient Barrera for the emotional roller-coaster 
ride of the last 15 months. From the depths of a physically debilitating 
depression to the giddy heights of national acclaim, the 65-year-old native of 
Cuba has survived the worst-case scenario of racing's arcane regulations to 
emerge on the threshold of a possible third Kentucky Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera has been holding court at Churchill Downs for the past week, putting 
the finishing touches on Mister Frisky's Derby preparation. The chestnut colt 
with the 16-for-16 record won the Santa Anita Derby on April 7 to place himself 
alongside Summer Squall as co-favorite to win the 116th Derby in Louisville, 
Ky. But it has been Barrera, one of the best-known trainers of the modern era, 
who commands just as much of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
A son of a Havana quarter-horse jockey, Barrera has won the Derby twice, with 
Bold Forbes in 1976 and with Triple Crown winner Affirmed in 1978. He has 
trained nearly 150 stakes winners, statistical territory occupied only by the 
likes of Charlie Whittingham, Wayne Lukas and Woody Stephens. He led North 
American trainers from 1977 through '80, and in 1979 he became the first Latino 
to be elected to racing's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, though, Barrera's pre-Derby interviews this time around have turned 
to the events of early 1989, when his name was linked to the alleged discovery 
of cocaine in the post-race urine samples of six Southern California 
thoroughbreds. Barrera was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, but the 
process was traumatic -- not only for the trainer, but for the entire racing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the cocaine controversies, the California Horse Racing Board was 
criticized by the Legislature, which funds its annual budget of about $8 
million. The seven CHRB commissioners have taken several steps to bring order 
out of the chaos, but the fact remains that Barrera and the other accused 
trainers have gone through public torment. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't think what Laz went through was positive in any respect," 
said Dr. Rick Arthur, a race track veterinarian who has been an activist in 
reforming the state's post-race testing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't think we necessarily had to go through that to get where we are 
today. I think what happened to him was a reaction by the CHRB staff that they 
felt they had to show they were doing something. Unfortunately, it showed 
exactly what we'd contended all along -- that they didn't know what they were 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to Laz was the point of no return. After that, the commissioners 
could no longer drag their feet about the problems in the drug-testing 
procedure. There was no confidence in their negative tests, just as there was 
no confidence in their positive tests." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the botched cocaine accusations, the racing board reduced the 
power of its executive staff and added an equine medical director to the 
process of evaluating all post-race test results. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a second laboratory was contracted to run parallel tests on 
post-race samples, using advanced technology. At the same time, procedures in 
the collection of post-race samples have been tightened, and referee samples 
are being split off to give trainers a separate specimen to conduct independent 
tests if an illegal substance is discovered by the official lab. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera said he welcomes the changes, especially if they protect the innocent. 
But nothing will erase the memory of Feb. 10, 1989, when the trainer was told 
by the Santa Anita Board of Stewards that one of his horses, a colt named 
Endow, tested positive for a small amount of cocaine after a retest of a frozen 
urine sample taken more than five months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Barrera still was reeling from the announcement just two days 
earlier that his son, Albert, had a filly that allegedly tested positive for 
cocaine after a race on Feb. 2. Two other trainers -- Anthony Hemmerick and 
Bryan Webb -- were similarly implicated. On Feb. 10, it also was revealed that 
Wayne Lukas' colt, Crown Collection, was flagged for what the lab called a 
cocaine positive, based on a retest of a frozen specimen. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Leonard Foote, executive secretary of the CHRB, brought 
formal charges against Barrera and the others, based on a racing rule that 
holds trainers ultimately responsible for everything involving their horses. 
They all faced the same six-month suspension and $2,000 fine that was levied 
against trainer Roger Stein in October, 1988, when his horse, Emperor's Turn, 
was alleged to have tested positive for cocaine. At the time of the new 
incidents, Stein received a stay of his penalties and was in the midst of an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements triggered a firestorm of protests and recriminations. Foote, 
the board's spokesman and chief investigative officer, was accused of acting 
precipitously. Truesdail Laboratories, the official testing firm, was accused 
of shabby procedures. Paranoia spread among trainers, who feared either 
sabotage or contamination of post-race samples. And the cynics in the media and 
on the backstretch had a field day. 
</P>
<P>
"No wonder Barrera and Lukas win so many races," went the wise guy line. "Their 
horses are flying." 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, the charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to pressure from the state attorney general's office, which 
essentially saw the cases as unwinnable if challenged in court, Foote took the 
trainers and the board off the hook by citing a lack of evidence based on "the 
accepted standard for the identification of cocaine." In other words, the rules 
were changed after the game was well under way. 
</P>
<P>
Truesdail, now bidding for a renewal of its testing contract, continues to 
stand by its original findings. Dr. Norman Hester, Truesdail's technical 
director, has repeatedly stated that their analysis was based on existing 
guidelines and their results were confirmed by the equine drug-testing facility 
at Ohio State University. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barrera and his attorney, Donald Calabria, maintain that the only way 
cocaine could have been found in a urine sample taken from the trainer's horse 
was through outside contamination. According to Calabria, extensive independent 
tests conducted at the University of Utah revealed no cocaine in the specimen 
taken from Endow. The same negative result, the attorney said, was obtained for 
the Lukas horse. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Barrera has sued Truesdail for $25 million in damages, although 
the lab reportedly carries barely $500,000 in liability protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the money," Barrera said earlier this year as he 
contemplated the suit. "If a lab can do this to me, they can do it to anybody. 
Let them go out of business. Let them use their building for the homeless 
people to sleep in." 
</P>
<P>
Barrera, known for his ready sense of humor and an endless round of tall tales 
from his colorful past, was serious. During his period in limbo -- between the 
Feb. 10 announcement and the May 30 dismissals -- he became alarmingly morose, 
and his health deteriorated drastically. 
</P>
<P>
A robust 6-footer, Barrera dropped as much as 30 pounds. His diabetic condition 
became aggravated, threatening his vision. His doctor warned him that the 
combination of stress, depression and exhaustion was taking its toll on a heart 
that had gone through bypass surgery in 1979 and a bypass replacement in '84. 
</P>
<P>
"He took it too hard," recalled Carmen Barrera, Lazaro's wife of 40 years. "It 
was like watching him die a little bit at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Hal King, a fellow trainer who first met Barrera in Mexico City 36 years ago, 
was not surprised that the cocaine allegations weighed so heavily on his 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very prideful man, and for his entire life the only important things to 
him have been his horses and his family," said King, who retired from training 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He had trained for 46 years in three different countries without so much as a 
single ruling against him . . . and considered himself a role model for Latin 
American people everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"So when this (cocaine) thing came out, it just about destroyed him. The most 
difficult thing to do is prove your innocence. And on top of that, he became 
paranoid about even the people he knew. If somebody didn't talk to him, he 
would think, 'Do they think I really gave my horse cocaine?' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Barrera, whose daughter, Blanchita, is married to a Mexico City attorney: 
"In Mexico, there was even an article accusing me of using cocaine. Kids were 
asking my grandchildren about their grandfather and cocaine. Can you imagine 
how that made me feel? I was so embarrassed, I wanted to die." 
</P>
<P>
On the professional side, Barrera's stable was already struggling when the 
cocaine allegations surfaced. He lost his major client in December, 1988, when 
Oregon lumberman Aaron Jones decided to hire a private trainer. The 
once-flourishing Barrera barn was down to about 20 horses, very few of them 
stakes-class and many owned all or in part by Barrera himself. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Garcia, Barrera's assistant at the time, attempted to keep the staff 
running smoothly while the boss coped with the CHRB accusations and their 
aftermath, but morale around the barn clearly suffered. At year's end, the 
Barrera horses had won only 31 races and earned just $1,562,562, his lowest 
total since 1973, when he first made the North American top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Mister Frisky came into Barrera's life. The Florida-bred colt won his 
first 13 races for owners Jose and Marta Fernandez in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
then was shipped to Barrera at Santa Anita in January. For Barrera, Mister 
Frisky was a four-legged miracle tonic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm alive again," said Barrera, who never dodges a chance to be dramatic. "And 
I don't hold anything against the racing board. But you know something? Nobody 
has ever come up to me and said, 'I'm sorry we did this to you.' Nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Foote, who retired in February, sympathizes with Barrera. 
</P>
<P>
"But the one thing that can't be done, because there are lawsuits all over the 
place, is to say, 'I'm sorry,' " Foote said this week from his Sacramento home. 
"That's an expression that would imply there was some negligence involved. And 
actually, there was not. The one basic error made throughout was that no one 
had ever established a standard for what constitutes a positive. And California 
is not alone in this." 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarian Arthur, on the other hand, said the reason for the cocaine 
controversy is not that simple. He and several colleagues in the Horsemen's 
Benevolent and Protective Assn. maintain that there was and is an ongoing 
threat of cocaine entering the system of racehorses and that the racing board 
of 15 months ago was not equipped to respond to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Trainers do have to be very afraid of cocaine positives, because it is a drug 
of abuse," Arthur said. "There's always the potential of personnel in the barn 
getting involved with something like that. When Laz said, 'If I've ever touched 
cocaine, you can cut off my hand,' undoubtedly he meant it. The investigations 
should have been looking elsewhere all the time, but because of the trainer 
insurer (responsibility) rule, the trainer was the focal point." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur is confident that the system has been changed to prevent a recurrence of 
the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is now being overseen by someone in an independent scientific 
manner," he said. "The entire process is under constant review. Procedures have 
been implemented that would prevent someone being accused publicly before all 
the facts are in. These are things that the HBPA was recommending for a long 
time, and I think it will end up positive in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't think Laz had to be embarrassed the way he was," Arthur 
concluded. "I think the whole thing demonstrated exactly what we had been 
talking about -- that the California Horse Racing Board drug-testing program 
was a disaster waiting to happen. And it happened." 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, ridden by Gary Stevens, worked five furlongs Tuesday in 1:01 
4/5. The Santa Anita Derby winner, who will be ridden by Stevens in the 
Kentucky Derby, finished especially strong, covering the last eighth of a mile 
in :11 2/5. "That's the way you win the race," trainer Laz Barrera said. . . . 
Unbridled, the Florida Derby winner, worked in the same time. . . . The track 
was fast before heavy rain made it sloppy for the races in the afternoon. . . . 
More rain is possible through Friday. The forecast Saturday is for clearing, 
with no rain and temperatures in the 60s.
