NEWSMAKERS: HIROHITO LEAVES $15.4 MILLION

Despite having been stripped of much of his holdings after World War II, 
Japan's late Emperor Hirohito has left his family $15.4 million in stocks and 
savings accounts, according to news reports. Hirohito never wrote a will, but 
his aides have come up with a plan to divide his estate between his widow, the 
Empress Dowager Nagako, and his eldest son and the new emperor, Akihito, 
according to the reports. Hirohito's estate would have been worth billions more 
if reforms imposed on Japan after the war by Allied occupation authorities had 
not forced him to relinquish holdings, including the Imperial Palace and 
several imperial villas, to the state. The palace declined comment, saying a 
public announcement now would be premature. Under Japanese law, heirs to 
property must claim their inheritance within six months of the owner's death 
and the tax administration office must announce the claims within four months 
after that. It will be the first public accounting of the imperial family's 
private finances since shortly after World War II. Hirohito died Jan. 7 at age 
87.

 -- In New York, the Anti-Defamation League paid tribute posthumously to 
another Japanese man, Sempo Sugihara, who helped thousands of Jews escape the 
Nazis during World War II. The league presented its "Courage to Care Award," 
which recognizes exceptional acts of rescue made by non-Jews in behalf of Jews, 
to Sugihara's widow, Yukiko, and his son, Hiro, during a Holocaust remembrance 
ceremony. Sugihara, who died in 1986, saved about 4,000 Polish and Lithuanian 
Jews in August, 1940, by issuing them Japanese transit visas enabling them to 
travel across the Soviet Union. The ADL said that as the 39-year-old consul in 
Kovno, Lithuania, Sugihara continued to issue the visas "despite repeated 
objection by his government," which was weeks away from an alliance with Nazi 
Germany. He stopped issuing visas only when he was ordered out of the country 
Sept. 1.

 -- First Lady Barbara Bush came clean about the goings-on in the White House. 
During a visit to The Learning Bank, an adult learning center in Baltimore, 
Mrs. Bush told reporters that the family dog, Millie, likes to shower in the 
bathroom in the presidential suite. "Millie, of course, doesn't take them 
alone, because she's too short to reach up," the First Lady said. "But someone, 
a very high public official, elected to office, takes a shower with Millie 
every week or so. They took one yesterday," she said. As she left the center, 
Mrs. Bush said: "I hope that same public official won't be sore at me." SHIRLEY

MARVIN HIME, 69; BEVERLY HILLS JEWELER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marvin Hime, whose expertise in jewels was used by police departments needing 
to establish authenticity and by Hollywood stars seeking the perfect gift, died 
at his Beverly Hills home Friday of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the longest-established jewelry shop in Beverly Hills was 69 and 
over the years had designed and sold jewelry to such celebrities as Barbra 
Streisand, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Sylvester Stallone, Julie Andrews and many 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Hime belonged to the prestigious Diamond International Academy and was a 
four-time winner of the Diamond International Design Awards, while his designs 
have been the focal point of museum displays. 
</P>
<P>
He started his relatively modest-appearing shop in 1948 shortly after service 
in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
He had $2,000, he told The Times in 1968, no job and a wife to support. 
</P>
<P>
"I started looking through the Yellow Pages trying to find a business to get 
into. Between janitor and junk I found jewelry. It cost me $1,700 to open a 
showroom and with the $300 I had left I invested in novelty jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I was stupid. I should have sold cars or cigarettes or refrigerators 
-- things people had gone without during the war." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his "stupidity," Hime managed $24,000 worth of business his first year, 
doubled that his second and doubled that again his third. 
</P>
<P>
He had opened his shop originally in downtown Los Angeles but with his 
new-found success moved to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modest Ways 
</P>
<P>
But he kept modest ways. Rather than displaying a single stone in a single 
tray, Hime crowded expensive diamonds into cases that might more appropriately 
belong to a dime store. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Hime's creations have included such diverse trinkets as 1,000 
heart-shaped key rings for Frank Sinatra, who used them for a benefit in Palm 
Springs, to the crest ring worn by Richard Boone as Paladin in television's 
long-ago favorite, "Have Gun Will Travel." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, he began sharing his expertise with law enforcement, teaching 
officers and customs agents how to evaluate stolen property, to see if a stone 
being brought into the country at a "declared" $10,000 might be worth 10 times 
that, or if a victim had paid $5,000 for a piece of glass. 
</P>
<P>
He had many unique policies, loaning jewels to stars for Oscar night or to 
their studios for filming. Customers who received jewelry as a gift but did not 
wear jewelry could exchange it for future credit for their wives or husbands. 
Customers who received jewelry they did not like exchanged it for something 
they did, regardless of where it was purchased. 
</P>
<P>
He operated at minimum profit (Louella Parsons called him "Hime the honest 
jeweler") but earned enough to become a major donor to charities and managed to 
make friends out of most of his customers. Many of them became the source of 
some of the better stories around town. 
</P>
<P>
Like the man who ran into Hime's store one day, put $500 cash on the counter 
and said, "Hurry up, give me something worth $500. Maybe she'll like it." 
</P>
<P>
When Hime asked why the rush, the man explained he only had two cents in the 
parking meter and didn't want a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Ann, a son and three grandchildren. Services were 
private.

HAROLD GEBHARDT, 81; SCULPTOR, ARTS TEACHER AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Gebhardt, an artist and academician who began carving wooden horses when 
he was a young man on his father's Wisconsin farm and became a leading sculptor 
and professor emeritus of fine arts at USC, died Friday in Sylmar. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Known primarily as a sculptor in wood and stone, Gebhardt also had a reputation 
for small acrylic paintings. He had exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American 
Art in New York, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, the Los Angeles 
County Art Museum and institutes and museums in Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, 
Portland, Santa Barbara and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Gebhardt studied at the Layton School of Art in his native Wisconsin before 
moving to Los Angeles about the time of World War II. He maintained a studio in 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
He headed the sculpture department at the old Los Angeles County (now Otis) Art 
Institute from 1943 to 1957 and at Occidental College from 1941 to 1961. He was 
a professor of fine arts at USC from 1957 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in 1976 of his paintings, Times art critic William Wilson said, "They 
seem to represent a late love affair by a man set from both academic 
responsibility and the weighty strictures of sculpting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Evelyn, two sons, a daughter and three grandsons.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOTEL'S OPERATOR ACCUSED ON TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The operator of the Radisson Plaza Hotel &amp; Golf Course in Manhattan Beach 
deducted thousands of dollars from employee paychecks but failed to pass the 
tax money on to the state, the district attorney's office has charged. 
</P>
<P>
Horst Dieter Osterkamp is scheduled to appear May 10 in South Bay Municipal 
Court to answer misdemeanor criminal charges that he failed to turn over to the 
state $120,000 in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations are among a set of problems that besets the management of the 
hotel, including a labor dispute and previous misdemeanor charges that the 
Radisson has not paid more than $200,000 in hotel bed taxes. If convicted of 
all the criminal allegations, Osterkamp could be sentenced to up to seven years 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Osterkamp, 48, is president of US Hotel Properties, which operates the 364-room 
Radisson and about a dozen other American hotels. US Hotel leases the Radisson 
from a partnership headed by the investment firm of Shearson, Lehman, Hutton.

Californians are famous for their love of vehicles and propensity to drive and 
drive and drive and drive. But very few can hold a steering wheel to James 
Monroe Moore, a man who truly knows his vehicle -- in this case, an 
80,000-pound cement mixer truck. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 65, who drives for Werner Corp., has covered more than 4 million miles 
on the job without a single accident since he slipped behind the wheel back in 
1948 in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he was named Southern California's best driver by the National 
Safety Council and was inducted into its Million Mile Club. Only one other 
recipient of the award has ever logged that many miles. 
</P>
<P>
Art Arbizu, director of the Irwindale-based Teamsters and Rock Products 
Industry Training Program, which provides schooling for cement truck drivers, 
noted, "His record is very unusual. The mixer truck is the most complicated 
truck to drive because it's so top-heavy and easy to topple." Moore learned 
tricks of the trade on his first job. "We made 60 cents an hour then, and they 
gave drivers $10 extra at the end of the month if they didn't have an 
accident," he explained. "Those were heavy dollars, so I drove defensively." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "It's like a horse. You can't be afraid of the trucks, but you have 
to have respect for them. And once in the saddle, you are the boss." 
</P>
<P>
Another vehicle competition will be held next week, when more than 200 regional 
drivers vie for recognition in the 52nd Annual Truck Driving Championship. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Olympics, the Super Bowl, the World Series all rolled into one," 
said George Reid, president of Con-Way Western Express, which is hosting the 
May 13 meeting in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Companies from all over Southern California are sending their top drivers to 
perform fancy maneuvers, such as gliding through lanes with only a three-inch 
clearance on each side, making tricky turns from one alley to another, backing 
up to docks and executing serpentine turns. 
</P>
<P>
While truckers are trying to make the highways safer, criminals are going to 
make the streets a cleaner place, thanks to a new court program. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn Tuesday kicked off an alternative sentencing 
program under which those convicted of misdemeanors in West Los Angeles 
Municipal Court may have to spend 10 to 20 hours sweeping streets and 
performing other civic jobs such as cleaning police stations, repairing cars 
and doing clerical work. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, up to 700 offenders a month deemed by the judges not to 
be a threat will work off their time by working for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials believe that many offenders commit crimes because 
they feel no ties to the community. "We're going to show them we expect them to 
behave as members of the community," said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who 
suggested the program. 
</P>
<P>
And while street sweeping may seem like a piddling price to pay for a crime, 
Hahn noted that people who now are sentenced to 37 days or less in county jail 
actually serve less than a day behind bars because of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
And yet more car news: 
</P>
<P>
Cal Worthington, a car salesman most famous for appearing in commercials with 
his dog Spot, was told by the Long Beach Planning Commission that it didn't 
like the spot where he was storing and selling trade-in cars. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy started when residents complained about a steady stream of cars 
through their neighborhood to a storage lot at 23rd Street and Euclid Avenue. 
The peace was also disrupted, they said, when dealers combed the lot, barking 
about trade-in prices. The lot is not zoned for such business, city officials 
ruled, and Worthington, who subleases the land, was ordered to stop the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
He applied for a conditional use permit to change the zoning, but the Planning 
Commission wouldn't let Worthington off the leash and denied his request.

OFFICIALS CALL JAIL CRISIS AN 'IMPOSSIBLE' SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Painting a bleak picture of San Diego County's ability to build jails without 
the half-cent sales tax that has been struck down by a court, county officials 
said Tuesday that, even if the county eliminated a wide range of social, health 
and law-enforcement programs, only a small portion of the needed jails could be 
funded. 
</P>
<P>
Without funds from Proposition A, a half-cent sales tax projected to raise $1.6 
billion for jails and courtrooms over the next decade, the county will be 
"placed in an absolutely impossible position," Assistant Chief Administrative 
Officer David Janssen told the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In a glum message aimed more at the public than the supervisors, who are 
already aware of the county's severe fiscal constraints, Janssen pointed out 
that the board has total discretion over only about $40 million of the county's 
$1.3-billion budget. The rest of the budget, he explained, consists of funds 
for programs mandated by state or federal laws -- money for which the county 
serves essentially as a financial funnel. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the county's discretionary revenue is being spent on programs that 
include the Sheriff's Department's street gang and narcotics units, probation 
honor camps, parks, health services and programs for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Far, Far Short' 
</P>
<P>
Even if those and other programs were dropped from the budget, the $40 million 
in savings would only equal about 16% of the annual amount that would be raised 
under Proposition A, which was narrowly approved by voters last June but ruled 
invalid by a Riverside County Superior Court judge in March. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is you could eliminate all of these programs -- and I don't 
think anyone would suggest that's very desirable -- and it still would be far, 
far short of what we need for jails and courts," Janssen said. 
</P>
<P>
In his March decision, Judge Gordon Burkhart ruled that San Diego voters' 50.6% 
support for the half-cent sales tax fell short of the two-thirds margin for new 
taxes mandated by Proposition 13, the landmark property-tax cutting initiative 
approved by statewide voters in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Should Burkhart's ruling not be overturned on appeal -- a process that could 
last up to two years -- the county "frankly would have no way to build jails," 
Janssen said.

MENTAL HEALTH'S PROPOSED CUTS STIR PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 250 mental health advocates gathered in front of the County 
Administration Building on Tuesday to protest Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed 
$200-million cut in state mental health funding, a move that could shrink San 
Diego's $45-million share by up to one-third next year. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the San Diego Coalition for Mental Health, carrying homemade 
signs that read: "This Could Be You" and "Mental Illness is a No Fault 
Disability," rallied during a county supervisors meeting that was held outside 
to accommodate the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lerner, a county spokesman, said the supervisors wanted to join the rally 
to "make a statement" showing their support. All five supervisors, amid cheers 
and applause, signed a resolution opposing the proposed reduction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Throw It in State's Lap 
</P>
<P>
If the cut is approved, Supervisor Susan Golding said, the county could decide 
to turn over operation of San Diego's mental health programs to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"If requirements put on mental health programs operated by the county are so 
stringent . . . then we can't operate them. We're really at the limit," she 
said. "That's very dramatic, but the state has the ultimate responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposed cut would reduce the county's mental health budget by 
up to $16 million. Describing the situation as a "state of emergency," Golding 
said reductions in an already tight mental health budget would mean putting 
more mentally ill on the street and cutting back on outpatient care. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how we can continue to do it. I'm not interested in running (a 
county mental health system) without adequate funding," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We remain 57th out of 58 counties (in per capita state financing for mental 
health), while being the second-biggest county in the entire state," she told 
coalition members. "San Diego is not alone, but we're just about the worst 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Brian Bilbray said: "The state of California thinks equality is 
giving each person in San Diego a little over $13 for mental health . . . . 
This is not just a mental health issue, this is not just a money issue, this is 
a civil rights issue." By contrast, San Francisco receives about $41 per 
capita. 
</P>
<P>
The county filed suit against the state three years ago, alleging that the 
state's allocation of money for mental health care and drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation programs violates the constitutional rights of San Diego County 
citizens. The suit, which is still pending, says people in San Diego have less 
access to these services than Los Angeles or San Francisco citizens.

The driver had been going about 70 m.p.h. when she missed a curve on Soledad 
Mountain Road and crashed into a motor home, setting off a chain-reaction crash 
and fire. 
</P>
<P>
Barbey, a 41-year-old Pacific Beach resident, didn't hesitate. He stopped his 
van and ran across the street. He said his only thought as he went to the 
woman's aid was, "God help me." 
</P>
<P>
The driver got out of the car, but left behind was an unconscious and bleeding 
passenger. Barbey broke a window and pulled the 17-year-old girl to safety. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Barbey and 21 other heroes were honored at the San Diego Burn 
Institute's 16th annual Spirit of Courage award banquet. The awards are given 
to people who risk their lives attempting to save others from fiery deaths, 
said Judith Copeland, executive director of the Burn Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Barbey, who is studying to become a minister, said his attempt to save the girl 
was instinctual. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about once every three seconds that something was going to 
explode or burn us up, and I knew I had to go as fast as possible. . . . I was 
totally geared on getting her out, and I'm glad God put me together to do it," 
Barbey said. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland said that Barbey's response to danger is typical of the more than 180 
heroes the institute has honored in the past. Barbey "was surrounded by fire on 
three sides. It was truly heroic. But they always say to us, 'We'd do it again 
in a moment, I'm not a hero. I did a job that had to be done.' That's been a 
common thread. They're always so humble . . . . I think Todd Barbey's (story) 
is pretty incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Copeland added that a special honor, the Exceptional Service Award, will be 
given to Victor Gonzalez, Mark Grow, David Lones, Forrest Kuhn and Andrew Parr 
of the Lakeside Fire Department. The five were almost killed June 10, 1988, 
when a burning house began to collapse as they were trying to rescue a man and 
woman trapped inside, Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
They got the woman out and "stayed inside an absolute inferno to get a man 
out," Copeland said.

PUT PLUG ON WASTING OF WATER, AUTHORITY URGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you hosed off your back-yard deck or sidewalk this morning, members of the 
San Diego County Water Authority forgive you. But, if you hose it off tomorrow 
. . . well, shame on you. 
</P>
<P>
Amid hoopla, flag-waving and a pledge by a contingent of Girl Scouts to 
conserve water, Water Awareness Week officially kicked off Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego County has yet to face mandatory water rationing, as some of 
its counterparts in Northern California have, water officials here are urging 
residents to voluntarily cut back water use by 10% this week. Officials hope 
the initial effort will become a habit. 
</P>
<P>
The program, part of a statewide effort to inform the public about the scarcity 
of water, runs through Sunday. On Saturday, residents will be asked to shut off 
all water for one hour -- from 2 to 3 p.m. -- as a reminder of the need to 
conserve. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials don't want residents to stop showering or wash their dishes in 
a bucket, but they do want people to curb water-wasting habits, said Dale 
Mason, water authority chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that, if residents don't curtail use now, they could find themselves 
facing mandatory measures later. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be urged to stop running the water while brushing their teeth, 
leaving the hose running while washing their cars and soaking their lawns when 
not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Despite projections of an adequate water supply through summer, San Diego 
County is far from certain to avoid a shortage, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
Water authority figures show that the average person uses about 110 gallons of 
water a day at home. San Diego County imports about 90% of its water from the 
Colorado River, via the Colorado River Aqueduct, and from Oroville, Calif., 
about 600 miles to the north via the California Aqueduct, Melton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Without water, San Diego could return to its desert state that it once was," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
To help in the effort, a free water conservation kit is available by contacting 
the County Water Authority. It includes a tip sheet on 25 ways to save water.

MINIMUM WAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By his refusal to allow not even a nickel raise in the minimum wage of $3.35 
throughout his two terms, President Reagan added immeasurable suffering to the 
bleak lives of millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
That moral obtuseness is now being addressed by Congress. However, in spite of 
his vision of a "kinder, gentler America," President Bush has vowed to veto the 
proposed increase which will gradually reach $4.55 by 1991. This promised veto 
speaks more clearly than the catchy rhetoric of his speech writers. It looks 
like America's poor are going to have another tough four years.

GUN-CONTROL LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is to address the key point of the personal weapons issue. 
</P>
<P>
This point is the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was written to 
ensure a means to overthrow the government by force of arms if necessary. The 
right to overthrow the government is mandated in the Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
The Founding Fathers possessed great wisdom by including this safeguard measure 
knowing that limited government as they established, tends to become unlimited 
government as we have in this country today. 
</P>
<P>
This point established, the conclusion drawn is that personal weapons for 
defense against the state should be military-type weapons. 
</P>
<P>
This poses a certain degree of risk of misuse of these weapons, one Patrick 
Purdy being the most recent example. But liberty can only be maintained by 
making the imposition of tyranny too perilous for the would-be Hitlers or 
Stalins in public office to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
I, for one, will take the danger.

<P>
In response to John Paul's letter on the stand of the NRA as outlined in its 
March full-page ad in The Times: 
</P>
<P>
The five changes in the law called for by the NRA are an attempt at (in Paul's 
words) "stopping criminals" from further violations -- but largely after a 
crime has been committed. Proponents of gun control want to prevent crimes from 
being committed. Too many guns are being purchased by people without any 
criminal record who then go on to maim and kill innocent people. Citizens don't 
need assault rifles and hunters don't need semiautomatic weapons to pursue 
their sport (how sporting is it for their targets?) 
</P>
<P>
NRA members are "zealots" and "gun fanatics," and no apology is due them.

THE ZIP-CODE ROUTE INTO UC; 
</P>
<P>
GPA COUNTS, BUT WHERE YOU LIVE MAY BE JUST AS CRITICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN E. BROWN, Susan E. Brown is director of higher education for the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and a member of the San 
Francisco Civil Rights Commission. Her commentary was written for Pacific News 
Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's system of higher education has been celebrated as the nation's 
model system, providing equal access to the American dream. But a look at who 
is admitted to the prestigious University of California campuses shows that ZIP 
codes may be as critical as grade point averages in determining who gets in and 
who stays out. 
</P>
<P>
This is how the system works: The top 12.5% of the state's high school 
graduates are eligible for the University of California; the top 33.5% are 
eligible for the state universities; for everyone else there is open access to 
community colleges with the option, after two years, of transferring into a 
four-year institution. 
</P>
<P>
California's goal has been a democratic one of making higher education 
available to one and all. The reality, however, reveals a system that favors 
the rich and the few. The list of the feeder high schools that send more than 
100 students each to UC reads like a social register. It includes Beverly 
Hills, Palos Verdes, Santa Monica, Rolling Hills, Palisades and, in the San 
Fernando Valley, Granada Hills, Birmingham and Taft. With the exception of San 
Francisco's Lowell and University high schools, the UC feeders are in 
predominantly, if not exclusively, white, affluent enclaves. Not surprisingly, 
the mean family income for freshmen at UC Berkeley last fall was nearly 
$60,000, well above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Both the California Master Plan and Education Code are structured in such a way 
that students not originally eligible for a state university may be able to 
transfer after two years at a community college. But to the extent that 
transfer from a community college to UC works at all, it works primarily for 
the select, the affluent -- and principally the white -- community college. The 
top 10 community college feeder campuses to UC for fall, 1986, were mainly in 
affluent residential communities: Santa Monica (252 transfers), Diablo Valley 
(241), Santa Barbara (227), Orange Coast (207), Cabrillo (151), El Camino 
(143), De Anza (139), San Diego Mesa (138), American River (132) and Saddleback 
(132). 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, consider Fresno City College, which serves large numbers of 
minority students from a predominantly agricultural region: Only one black and 
four Latinos (out of a total student body of 13,000) transferred to UC in 1986. 
Imperial Valley Community College, serving a similar student body, sent only 
three Latinos to UC campuses out of a freshman class of 1,341 that year. At 
predominantly black Compton College, only two blacks transferred to a UC campus 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the 106 community colleges in California sent a total of 189 blacks 
and 485 Latinos to the eight UC campuses, an average of six minority students 
from each college. Yet approximately 80% of underrepresented minorities who 
enter college in the state begin their studies in a community college. 
</P>
<P>
While it is surely important to maintain high standards, the goal of a 
tax-based state educational system should be the development of talents and 
skills from all socioeconomic groups. Public education by its very nature must 
reflect the entire population that supports it. What California has, instead, 
is a perfectly correlated system of family income to educational benefits -- 
that is, the wealthiest are rewarded with access to the University of 
California; middle-income students end up at the California State University; 
low-income students begin and end their higher education at community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
One possible solution to the perpetuation of a hereditary elite is to expand 
eligibility to UC and CSU to the top 12.5% and top 33.5% of students at every 
high school. There is nothing in state law or the California Master Plan to 
prevent this more egalitarian approach. Without such a remedy, California will 
merely continue to favor students from those schools with honor courses, 
enriched curriculums, well-equipped science laboratories and optimal learning 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't a serious student at an inner-city school who graduates in the top 
10% of his or her class have the same access to the benefits of California's 
postsecondary system as his or her counterpart in an exclusive private or 
magnet public school? If not, we should recognize that we are rewarding 
accidents of birth and that our current system of admissions to the University 
of California is, in truth, determined by ZIP code.

A FLAWED VIEW OF FUTURE EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
CLASSIC EXCLUSION OF SOVIETS WEAKENS SECURITY OF OUR 'HOME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY F. HOUGH, Jerry F. Hough is director of the Center on East-West Trade, 
Investment and Communications at Duke University and a senior fellow at the 
Brookings Institution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry A. Kissinger has begun to vigorously push a concept of a Europe extending 
from the Soviet-Polish border to the Atlantic. He is fuzzy in his public 
statements about the place of Germany in this Europe, but virtually everything 
he says implies that the division of that country would remain. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger's notions need the deepest scrutiny and debate. The former head of 
Kissinger Associates, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, is now the top specialist on 
East-West relations in the State Department. The former head of the Washington 
office of Kissinger Associates, Brent Scowcroft, is President Bush's national 
security adviser. Their general approach has been heavily influenced by 
Kissinger, and if the Bush Administration is guided by this vision, the result 
will be disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Kissinger view of the future stems from a clear perception of an obvious 
truth: The postwar period has been very good for the United States. The Great 
Depression of the 1930s was not repeated, and the Soviets were successfully 
contained during the virulent period of their history. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, the divisions between England, France and Germany that produced 
two world wars in this century were ended. The Atlantic community, including 
the United States, ended 400 years of war and created a "common home" of 600 
million Europeans from the Elbe to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the United States does have an interest in the preservation of this 
status quo -- perhaps, if necessary, with a controlled increase in East 
European autonomy. The problem is that the Soviet Union has benefited far less 
from the postwar era. It is now determined to change things. Like it or not, we 
have to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger has always had a keen sense of 20th-Century geostrategy and a very 
weak sense of economics. He correctly understands that the Soviet Union today 
has a geostrategic interest in the continuation of European stability, even if 
this does require a North Atlantic Treaty Organization with a strong American 
military presence. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, two problems with his analysis. First, the 21st Century 
will be much different geostrategically. In 30 to 40 years, both China and 
India will be superpowers on the Soviet border with a billion people each. The 
Soviets have every interest to join with the other Europeans and create a 
"common European home" all the way from Vladivostok to Los Angeles as the 
nature of the potential threat changes. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the division of Europe and the economic isolation of the Soviet Union 
has meant total protectionism for Soviet manufacturers -- and protectionism has 
meant economic disaster. Moscow must have an export strategy, large foreign 
investment in the Soviet Union, large Soviet investment abroad and the 
international exchange of components found in the modern transnational 
corporation. This is incompatible with the foreign perception of Soviet threat 
-- or the level of Soviet military spending found in the past. Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev will be ruthless in reducing both. 
</P>
<P>
The Kissinger talk about a free Europe from the Polish-Soviet border to the 
Atlantic, but including a divided Germany, is not only hopelessly utopian; it 
also would lead directly to the instability he fears. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is determined to integrate into Europe and will never accept 
its border with Poland as the dividing line for Europe. It will not be left 
isolated to face China and India alone. 
</P>
<P>
An American policy designed to promote freedom for Poles, Hungarians and 
Czechs, but to preserve slavery for East Germans, will have disastrous 
propaganda consequences in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The strong reluctance to have troop reductions demands that German youth 
continue to serve through a military draft even as Gorbachev seems to be ending 
the threat of East-West confrontration. That is simply unrealistic. Meanwhile, 
Americans have every interest in reducing military spending to reduce the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
What must we do? First, we must insist that we (and Latin America) speak a 
European language and have a European culture. We must preserve the European 
home we have created over the last 40 years. Europe cannot end at the Atlantic, 
but at the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
We also must accept that Russians are Europeans. The Russian Orthodox religion 
comes out of the Judeo-Christian and Greek traditions. Their literary and 
artistic achievements in the tradition of Tolstoy and Tchaikovsky are part of 
modern European culture. We cannot make them deny their tradition, and we 
should not. 
</P>
<P>
Our policy should be of one Europe, from Vladisvostok to Los Angeles. It will 
be good to add the 350 million Russians and East Europeans to our 600 million 
and have a billion Europeans in a world in which the other superpowers have a 
billion people as well. Indeed, we should be struggling to get the Japanese in 
our common home, too. 
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the postwar era were real accomplishments. The statesmen of 
that era, including Henry Kissinger, were very skilled. A new generation needs 
comparable skill to solve new problems, but the one recipe for disaster is 
simply to follow the old rules that worked in an era that has now passed into 
history.

WHEN ANONYMITY OF CALLER IS LOST, WE'RE THAT CLOSER TO A SURVEILLANCE SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY T. MARX, Gary T. Marx, a professor of sociology at MIT, is author of 
Undercover: Police Surveillance in America. (University of California Press, 
1988) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people who brought us call-forwarding and call-waiting have done it again 
-- this time in the form of call-identification. Telephone customers in many 
parts of the country who are willing to spend an extra $6 a month will soon be 
able to know the number from which an incoming call was dialed before they pick 
up their phone. This service requires purchasing a video display device that 
keeps a record of the time and phone number of incoming calls. 
</P>
<P>
The system offers many advantages. It can deter (or determine the origin of) 
crank calls and false alarms. It will provide the location of persons who 
request emergency help. It can mean faster consumer services (a sales 
representative can have your record displayed even as the phone is being 
answered). Burglars who telephone to be sure that no one is home may be 
identified by the phone number they unwittingly leave. Call-identification 
permits screening calls (you don't answer if it's a tiresome relative). 
</P>
<P>
People calling know your number; isn't it only fair that you should know 
theirs? 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. There may be times when an imbalance in the relationship is 
desirable. Anonymity has positive as well as negative consequences. Persons 
with unlisted phone numbers may involuntarily have to reveal them. The calls to 
law- enforcement and counseling hot lines may decline because of the suspicion 
that anonymity is no longer guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Those calling for information about goods and services may receive an avalanche 
of unwanted phone and mail solicitations, particularly if their names are 
distributed by a mass-marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
The new visibility encroaches on white lies, spontaneity and quiet personal 
detective work. Our sense of autonomy and self are enmeshed in a complex web of 
privacy, secrecy, diplomacy and fabrication. Anything that curtails social 
maneuverability and alters these delicate relationships, whatever its other 
benefits, is likely to be morally ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
The increased ease of verifying location might be thought to make people more 
honest, but this is balanced by the fact that a record will be left of the act 
of verification. Thus, if you invite friends to a party and they say they can't 
come because of an obligation at home, you may be less likely to call to check 
if they were telling the truth since there will be a record that you called. 
Knowing that, they may be more likely to lie. 
</P>
<P>
Supervision in the home will become more intensive and democratic. Spouses, 
parents and children will find it easier to check up on each other. The spouse 
who is visiting a friend can no longer call home and say that he or she is 
working late; the teen-ager prohibited from associating with a certain person 
will find it more difficult to take calls from that person, while pretending to 
be talking to someone else. Gone is the freedom to hang up if a person we do 
not want to talk to answers, or if we develop second thoughts about making the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of the service will depend partly on how it is offered. 
Callers could be told that the line they have reached has call-identification 
and be given the option of hanging up before their number is revealed. Or 
callers could be told that they can block call-identification by entering 
several digits. Or callers could be denied any controls and their number 
displayed without their knowledge or consent. The latter will be the case for 
callers in New York and New England served by Nynex. The interests of the 
receiver are put above those of the caller. In the system proposed by Pacific 
Telesis for its West Coast customers, callers will be able to block the display 
of their number. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast offering is far superior. It preserves the caller's privacy, but 
not at a cost of being unable to make the phone call. Those receiving the call 
would be given some information that the party calling did not want his or her 
number revealed. Crank callers could still be identified through another new 
phone company service -- call-tracing. 
</P>
<P>
In their marketing research the phone companies discovered that West Coast 
customers were much more concerned with privacy protection than were East Coast 
customers. But when matters of principle are at stake, marketing research ought 
not to prevail. There are important questions of informed consent and privacy 
here. As phone company customers, we are both callers and receivers and the 
interests of both ought to be served. 
</P>
<P>
Call-identification is a small eddy in a torrent of new information-gathering 
technologies that are turning us into a transparent or surveillance society. 
Liberty to do good or evil partly resides in the cracks of inefficient 
technology. As these are patched, our vigilance must increase.

COMPATRIOT HOLDS THE KEY TO DANCING AT THE GREAT GREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fate of Sherman Oaks' Great Greek is in the hands of Tarzana's "great 
Greek." 
</P>
<P>
The first is a popular Ventura Boulevard restaurant whose owners are applying 
for a city permit that will allow their customers to continue conga-line-style 
Greek dancing around dinner tables. 
</P>
<P>
The second is Greek-born Nick Patsaouras, a member of the Los Angeles city 
Board of Zoning Appeals, who was called upon Tuesday to break a deadlock among 
other panel members over whether such a permit should be issued. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the 5-year-old Great Greek restaurant have applied for a city 
entertainment permit that would legitimize the "spontaneous" dancing that 
breaks out nightly at the eatery when the music of a Greek bouzouki sets 
waiters singing. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby homeowners have opposed the permit on grounds that the restaurant has 
failed to live up to customer parking requirements imposed by the city when the 
first permit was issued in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
When an associate zoning administrator approved the dancing license three 
months ago, homeowners appealed. Their protest triggered a 2 1/2-hour City Hall 
hearing before four members of the zoning board. But Patsaouras, a Tarzana 
resident who heads the panel, was absent. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner John Allen told the board that the restaurant has failed to come up 
with 60 off-street parking spaces that the original city permit demanded. He 
displayed large photographs he said showed a Great Greek employee illegally 
parking his car on a residential street a block south of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leases Negotiated 
</P>
<P>
But restaurant co-owner Vicki Criezis testified that she has negotiated leases 
that allow her valet parking attendants to park the required 60 customer cars 
during nighttime hours on neighboring businesses' property. She said attendants 
for other area restaurants do park customers' cars on the street, however. She 
came armed with large color photographs of similarly dressed attendants that 
suggested homeowners are confusing hers with those of her rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Board members John W. Mack and Joseph D. Mandel voted against the permit after 
criticizing the restaurant for dancing around the parking issue and ignoring 
the city's earlier requirements. "I'm not going to countenance someone thumbing 
their nose at the city," Mandel said. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues James D. Leewong and Ilene Olansky voted for the permit, however, 
after suggesting that the restaurant's 119-person occupancy be reduced by 10%. 
Both said they'd eaten at the restaurant and found dancing around the dinner 
tables fun, if somewhat crowded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unrealistic' Position 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unrealistic to deny an act that will happen in any event," 
Leewong said of the dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Leewong said Patsaouras, whom he called "the real great Greek," must listen to 
a tape of Tuesday's meeting and can then cast the deciding vote. If Patsaouras 
does not vote, the permit will automatically be granted. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, he once told an interviewer that his favorite pastime is dancing alone 
Greek-style in a taverna because the bouzouki "makes my whole body awaken."

AROUND THE VALLEY: IT LOOKED LIKE KING KONG'S ARMY VERSUS MOMMY AND THE KIDS 
NEXT DOOR.

Basketball versus murder. 
</P>
<P>
A game against death. 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't make sense. But then again, why not? 
</P>
<P>
The problem human beings have had with death, probably since the first bright 
ape stood up, flexed an opposable thumb and figured out that death was a Great 
Truth, has been how to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
Powdered ocher, hymns and chants, ranks of torch-bearing warriors, art, 
religion, massive pyramids of stone, slaughtered bulls, phalanxes of priests, 
poetry, statues, cathedrals, memorials, gravestones, crypts, hermetically 
sealed coffins, blazing pyres, urns of ash, perpetual trust funds, eternal 
flames and the wail of a solitary bagpiper, all have been used as a reply to 
death, as a comment or a comfort or a defiance. 
</P>
<P>
Puny responses by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
But what else is there? 
</P>
<P>
So it was as sensible as these things get for Hal Arthur's colleagues and 
students at Grant High School in Van Nuys to hold a basketball game in his 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have developed a tradition of doing things they enjoy doing but 
ennobling the fun by frolicking in the name of a higher cause: jog against 
cancer, tennis for the homeless, roller skate against ignorance, drink 
champagne for the blind orphans. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this game was to raise funds for a scholarship fund in Arthur's 
memory, money that will go to Grant students who go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is that a generation from now, there will still be students who know 
Arthur's name and feel some gratitude to him. 
</P>
<P>
That may or may not be of interest or concern to whoever it was who ambushed 
Arthur in the driveway of his home on Good Friday, pumping three bullets into 
him from a nearby car in the kind of cool, slick assassination that is 
thrilling in spy movies and nauseating in real life. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur's killing left a sizable mystery, plus a large number of former students 
who remember his history and government classes as a major event of their high 
school years. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the scholarship fund, not many of them turned up for the 
game, even with the Los Angeles Raiders football team as a draw. 
</P>
<P>
Only 200 tickets were sold at $5 each, raising $1,000. Only about 170 
spectators turned up, including the high school band and cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders play charity basketball games in their off-season to keep their 
reflexes tuned and to generate halo-polishing PR. 
</P>
<P>
For the scholarship fund, they faced off against the "Media All-Stars," an 
anomalous label for as motley a crew of hoop hobos as could be found outside a 
midnight pickup game on a padlocked playground in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the team was a group of sportswriters and sportscasters, who run 
surprisingly well for people who make their living sitting down, throwing stuff 
that is lighter than a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Backing them up were seven players from Grant High, plus Ann Meyers, who was an 
all-American on the UCLA women's team in the late 1970s. She is married to 
former Dodgers star Don Drysdale. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers brought her 21-month-old son, Don Drysdale Jr. He toddled about the 
sidelines in a T-shirt labeling him "Champ," trying to dribble a basketball 
with about as much success as anyone his age. 
</P>
<P>
The high school boys and Meyers made a strange combination against the 
massively muscled pro football players. It looked like King Kong's army versus 
mommy and the kids next door. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers was the player most likely to take charge on the court, snapping out 
orders and womanfully defending her space from the galloping behemoths. 
</P>
<P>
She took command because "I played against these guys three years ago, and 
sometimes I can see what they're up to," she said. "Sometimes they play 
basketball the way they play football. They'll just crowd you out of the way if 
you let them." 
</P>
<P>
The high school players had some advantages over the adults, both cumbersome 
pros and panting amateurs, she observed. "They're faster, they jump better and 
they have younger bodies." 
</P>
<P>
So they did in the first half. It ended with the "All-Stars" holding a 55-44 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Meyers observed, "The Raiders have the advantage of being 
professional athletes, which makes an enormous mental difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders made her a prophet as soon as play resumed. They quickly pulled 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Grant students rooted one-sidedly for their classmates, but the Raiders had 
their own borrowed cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
It's not often that 17-year-olds get a chance to come out of retirement, but 
Grant has a two-squad cheerleader system. The Girls of Autumn, who ended their 
careers some months ago, were asked to come back as perhaps the youngest 
Raiderettes ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no choice," said Susanne Maltzman, 17, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"The new cheerleaders wanted the other team because our players are on that 
side. We were going to wear our Retired Cheerleader sweat shirts but decided 
not to. Everybody knows we're retired." 
</P>
<P>
To distinguish themselves, the over-the-hill squad put Raider bumper stickers 
on their chests. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans had more to cheer about as the game ended with the Raiders running 
away, 103 to 89 (or maybe 102 to 88, or something like that). 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Robinson of the Raiders spent the last full minute of play running a 
victory lap around the court, a shirt wrapped around his head streaming behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age spectators hurried out to get in some gossiping and necking in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Death had been answered, at least as effectively as by building a pyramid or 
slaughtering a bull.

DONATIONS TO PICUS, WOO PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPERS MAY HAVE VIOLATED $500-PER-PERSON LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators are looking into multiple developer contributions accepted by 
recently reelected City Council members Joy Picus and Mike Woo as possible 
violations of Los Angeles' strict $500-per-person limit on campaign 
contributions, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Since voters passed the campaign limit in 1985, there have been repeated 
accusations that candidates and contributors seek to circumvent the law through 
various strategies. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Elias Martinez confirmed Tuesday that his office is probing both 
Picus' and Woo's campaign statements at the request of the city attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Although Martinez would give no details, Woo campaign manager Steve Afriat said 
the investigation centers on fourteen $500 contributions accepted by the 
councilman from seven executives of the Lycon Group, a development firm, and 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contributions Returned 
</P>
<P>
"We returned half of the contributions, those from the children, because they 
seemed to go against the law, because the money actually appeared to come from 
the parents," Afriat said. 
</P>
<P>
"But Mike didn't catch it right away, so the returns didn't show up on our last 
campaign statement in late March. So I guess someone complained." 
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that investigators would drop the case once they 
examine the canceled checks by which the seven contributions from children of 
executives were returned. 
</P>
<P>
The Picus probe stems from a letter sent to City Atty. James Hahn by Paul 
McKellips, one of five candidates Picus edged out in the April 11 primary. 
</P>
<P>
McKellips said Tuesday that he urged investigators to look into $500 
contributions to Picus from Sherman Oaks developer Edward L. Saunders, his 
wife, and son Brad, who lives at the family home in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"When a child lives at home, it raises the question of whether he put up the 
money or whether his parents did it using him as a figurehead," McKellips said. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad is swimming in money," Anita Harkavy, an executive assistant at Saunders 
Development Corp., said Tuesday. "He is very wealthy on his own without mom and 
dad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enthusiastic Supporter' 
</P>
<P>
She termed Brad Saunders, 22, an "enthusiastic supporter of Picus in his own 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Also questioned by McKellips were three $500 contributions from Selleck 
Properties Inc., a Woodland Hills development firm. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the checks were sent in the name of other firms with the same address -- 
Sherman Way-White Oak Associates and Tampa-Saticoy Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the law also limits business entities to $500 each per candidate, 
McKellips asked, "Are these really separate businesses? I think that should be 
checked into." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Selleck, managing general partner and brother of actor Tom Selleck, said 
Tuesday he is convinced that the three firms, each of which is a different 
partnership, "are separate under the law's definition. We thoroughly reviewed 
that before making the contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Schuster, Picus' chief deputy, said she had "no doubt" that 
investigators would conclude that "we have followed the letter and spirit of 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
She said that in the recent campaign, Picus returned more than $30,000 in 
contributions that exceeded the $500 limit, out of a total of $280,000 in 
contributions.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SANTA CLARITA SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUE TO BLOCK 
HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Santa Clarita Valley school districts have sued the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors to block a 2,500-unit housing development in Saugus, an 
attorney for the districts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The William S. Hart Union High School and Saugus Union Elementary School 
districts contend in the suit, filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, that 
the board and the county Planning Commission should not have approved the 
project because it will overburden the already crowded school systems. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors in December approved the 602-acre project, proposed by 
Shapell-Monteverde. The project, just outside the Santa Clarita city limits, 
calls for 1,297 houses and 1,302 condominiums and apartments east of Plum 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell-Monteverde will still need county approval when it submits detailed 
plans, but the developer was guaranteed the right to complete the project over 
12 years. The lawsuit also asks the court to throw out this guarantee, said 
Wendy H. Wiles, an attorney for the Hart and Saugus districts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is similar to one filed by the districts against the 
Shapell-Monteverde development approved by supervisors a year ago, Wiles said. 
That suit, concerning a 700-home project, argued that the supervisors should 
compel the developer to pay for new schools. 
</P>
<P>
The first lawsuit against Shapell-Monteverde was dismissed by a Los Angeles 
Municipal Court judge Feb. 27. The judge agreed with county attorneys, who said 
the supervisors could not force developers to pay fees exceeding those already 
required by a state school-financing law. The Hart and Saugus districts 
appealed the judge's ruling Friday, Wiles said.

PITCHING COLLAPSE PERPETUATES SKID IN MEMORIAL STADIUM

It had to happen sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel pitching staff, proud owners of the best earned-run average (2.69) 
and the fewest number of walks (61) in the American League before Tuesday, saw 
the magic of April evaporate during their first outing of May. 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitchers took a walk on the wild side Tuesday night, sending 10 Orioles 
to first via the base on balls -- including five in the seventh inning -- as 
the Orioles came from behind to beat the Angels, 4-3, before 17,688 in Memorial 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels led, 3-1, when starter Chuck Finley walked Billy Ripken and Brady 
Anderson with one out in the seventh. Then came reliever Greg Minton, who got 
Phil Bradley to fly out to center on his first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Minton threw 13 more pitches, 12 of which were balls, one of which was a wild 
pitch. And the Angels, who are 13-0 when leading after seven innings, let one 
get away. 
</P>
<P>
"(Catcher Lance) Parrish came out to the mound and said, 'The ball's moving 
great, just throw strikes,"' Minton said, managing a smile. "I thought, 'Good 
idea, Lance, but I'm not trying to bounce these to the backstop.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the blame for this one. The whole game hinged on a few outs and I 
didn't get them." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Bob McClure came to the mound, the score was tied and the Orioles 
still didn't have a hit in the inning. McClure got the final out of the seventh 
and Willie Fraser worked a 1-2-3 eighth. But Fraser gave up a leadoff double to 
Anderson in the ninth and, a sacrifice bunt and sacrifice fly later, the 
Orioles were alone atop the AL East standings. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg didn't miss by that much, but the bottom line is (the calls) went the 
other way," Manager Doug Rader said. "As well as he's pitched for us this year, 
I certainly hope no one is overly critical of him." 
</P>
<P>
Minton, whose nickname is Moon Man, acknowledged that he fell into a crater 
this time, but he has been getting the key outs all season. He had allowed a 
run in only two of his first nine appearances and last night's was the first 
save opportunity he has blown. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was low," Minton said. "After the first few balls, I started 
thinking, 'I've got to get this one up.' Then I thought, 'Wait a minute, I 
can't throw a high sinker. 
</P>
<P>
"The Moonie just vapor-locked this time." 
</P>
<P>
For the first 6 1/2 innings, the Angel machine appeared to be running as 
smoothly as it has all season. Finley struggled a bit, but had given up six 
hits and only one run when Billy Ripken singled to left, Anderson walked and 
Bradley singled to score Ripken in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The sweet music of April then struck a sour chord when the Angel pitchers 
couldn't find the strike zone. They walked seven Orioles in the last three 
innings, including two intentional walks to load the bases with one out in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
That's when pinch-hitter Jim Traber, after fouling off a half dozen pitches, 
hit a fly ball to the warning track in right. But Anderson wasn't able to trot 
home with the winning run. Rookie right fielder Dante Bichette, who had thrown 
out Larry Sheets trying for a double and almost got the speedy Anderson in the 
same situation in the ninth, cranked up and fired the ball over Parrish's head 
at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Olson, who pitched two innings in relief of starter Jose Bautista, got 
the victory for Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Traber's at-bat was one of the better at-bats of the season," Oriole Manager 
Frank Robinson said. "There were three key plays in this game -- Anderson's 
double, Bradley's sacrifice and Traber's fly ball." 
</P>
<P>
Rader, however, pointed to the Angels' inability to keep Billy Ripken, who had 
two walks and a single, and Anderson, who had two walks and a double, off base. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in this game was we couldn't get out the No. 9 hitter (Billy 
Ripken) and the No. 1 hitter (Anderson)," Rader said. "That's the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels went ahead, 2-0, in the fourth inning when Wally Joyner and Johnny 
Ray found a spot on the right-field wall to their liking. Joyner missed a home 
run by about two feet -- in two directions -- with a drive that hit next to the 
360 sign on the 14-foot high wall. 
</P>
<P>
Two feet higher and it would have been over the fence; two feet more toward 
center and it would have hit the yellow area that designates a home run where 
the outfield fence veers away from the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner had to settle for a double, but he scored in a hurry when Ray followed 
with a slightly shorter shot that cleared the glove of a leaping Mike Devereaux 
and bounced off the wall for a triple. Ray scored on Devon White's single to 
right. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles cut the lead to two in the fifth, but Brian Downing, leading off 
the sixth, hit his fourth homer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have easily won this one," Finley said. "When Brian hit the homer, we 
should have won it. But it all comes back to those walks. Like they say, walks 
will haunt you." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who haven't won a season series in Memorial Stadium since 1978, 
always seem to find a weird way to lose in this park. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was the spectre of the base on balls that scared up another 
Oriole victory. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Claudell Washington flew home to Orinda, Calif. before Tuesday's 
game to be with his 15-year-old daughter, Camille, who was hospitalized after a 
household accident Tuesday afternoon. Washington departed in a rush and club 
officials had only sketchy details. . . . Right-hander Rich Monteleone, who was 
recalled from triple-A affiliate Edmonton on Monday, was 1-3 with a 3.82 
earned-run average, but the Trappers were shut out in his three losses. "I was 
pleased with the way I was pitching," Monteleone said. "I was in a groove as 
far as what I wanted to do with the ball." Monteleone acknowledged that he was 
surprised to be called up, especially considering the way the Angel pitching 
staff has performed. "It's not like they need pitching, the bullpen hasn't had 
much work," Monteleone said. "I'm just happy to be here, though." 
</P>
<P>
The question now is whether Monteleone will remain with the Angels when 
shortstop Dick Schofield, on the disabled list because of a minor tear of a 
chest muscle, returns. Trainer Rick Smith said Schofield should be ready for 
the four-game series against the Blue Jays that begins Thursday in Toronto. "I 
hope I'm not just here for a couple of days," Monteleone said. Manager Doug 
Rader isn't ready to announce a decision, but he opened the season with an 
11-man staff and said Tuesday that Monteleone was brought up and second baseman 
Mark McLemore was sent down to "protect" the pitching. "Our pitching has put us 
where we are," Rader said, "and I feel working with your strengths is a better 
way to go than attempting to shore up your weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Armas continues to feel tightness in his strained left hamstring when he 
runs and the Angels are taking no chances with the 35-year-old outfielder. "I 
think it's still going to be 10 days to two weeks," Smith said. "He's had 
problems with his legs before and we don't want 3 1/2 weeks of therapy to go 
down the drain because we tried to get him back one or two days early."

HERSHISER GETS HELP, FOR A CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
DODGER OFFENSE PROVIDES SEVEN RUNS AS HE BLANKS PIRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After struggling offensively, the Dodgers provided 12 hits in support of Orel 
Hershiser in their 7-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing unusual about a Hershiser shutout, of course, but the seven runs 
matched the total the Dodgers had scored in their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
And tonight they plan to stage an equally unusual event, honoring former Dodger 
Pedro Guerrero despite his spring criticism of Manager Tom Lasorda and 
Executive Vice President Fred Claire. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony that precedes the first of two games with the St. Louis Cardinals 
was planned in late March, after Guerrero had questioned Claire's baseball 
knowledge and said Lasorda did not have the respect of his players. 
</P>
<P>
"What Pedro said didn't change my assessment," Claire said Tuesday night, 
alluding to the appropriateness of the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at Pete's career here, his accomplishments with the Dodgers, the 
fact that he was on two world championship teams, I think he fits well with the 
type of player we've honored before -- Steve Garvey, Ron Cey, Davey Lopes, 
Dusty Baker, Don Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of Pete's reaction, I believe, has been out of emotion. I really think he 
understands the opportunity Tommy and the organization gave him. 
</P>
<P>
"As for what he said about me, I regard it as one man's opinion. I fully 
understood when I took this job that I'd be judged by a variety of people. 
</P>
<P>
"I can appreciate that Pete was hurt by the trade. That part of it isn't a 
surprise. On the other hand, I don't regret the trade. We acquired a pitcher 
(John Tudor) we needed very much." 
</P>
<P>
Claire said he would participate in the ceremony, making a presentation on 
behalf of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said he wasn't sure whether he would participate. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows I treated Pete like one of my own sons," Lasorda said. "I 
didn't deserve the things he said. He really hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger victory before 29,310 at Dodger Stadium eased some of Lasorda's most 
recent discomfort and brought the club back to the .500 mark at 13-13. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser allowed only six hits, walked none and struck out six in pitching his 
20th career shutout and first of this season in which he is 4-2 with a 1.58 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
A 1-0 loser to the Chicago Cubs' Greg Maddux in his last start, Hershiser has 
allowed only that one run in his last 20 1/3 innings, helping lower the team 
ERA to 2.34, best in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said Hershiser was like a surgeon, disputing the opinion of Pittsburgh 
Manager Jim Leyland that Hershiser lacked his best stuff and simply "took 
advantage of some not-so-smart hitting" by his injury decimated team. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave in to him," Leyland said. "We gave away a lot of at-bats. When you 
give up that many at-bats, everybody looks like Cy Young. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take anything away from him, but he wasn't unhittable." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser agreed to an extent, saying he lacked his best stuff early but found 
a groove after the third inning, allowing only two hits over the final six. 
</P>
<P>
And the offense helped make it easy for a change, raising the team's league-low 
batting average from .225 to .230 in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Catcher Rick Dempsey broke open a 1-0 game with a three-run homer in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Marshall, with four hits in his last 30 at-bats coming in, doubled in 
the Dodgers' first run in the third and doubled again in the seventh, 
eventually scoring the sixth run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mariano Duncan, a late lineup addition at shortstop, drove in two runs with 
a double and single. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Gwynn, who had been hitless in five at-bats since his recall but 
could have easily been five for five, had three singles as he drove in one run, 
scored another and prompted Lasorda, alluding to Tony Gwynn, to say that Chris 
"hits like his brother." 
</P>
<P>
 -- And Eddie Murray extended a hitting streak to 11 games with a single and 
double. He is 20 for 39 in the streak and has lifted his batting average to 
.306. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the Dodgers' dozen hits came at the expense of starter Neal Heaton, 
who went 5 2/3 innings and emerged with his third defeat of a winless season. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marshall of the Dodger attack: "Hitting is contagious. Hopefully this will 
get us started." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey hopes his homer has another effect. He hopes it keeps him in the 
lineup. He is batting .208 for the season, but has driven in 36 runs in 191 
at-bats in his two seasons with the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd definitely like to play more," he said. "Tommy knows that. Everyone knows 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"But I understand the situation and know it's something I have to accept. All I 
can do is try to impress Tommy every chance I get, but I don't get down on him 
when I don't play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I'm a young guy whose career is passing quickly. I'm an older 
guy trying to hold on. I used to fight it, but I understand it now, and I think 
that's made me a better player." 
</P>
<P>
A valuable player, certainly. Said Lasorda, of the contributions made by 
Dempsey, Duncan and Gwynn: "That's what has made this club so good the last two 
years. The talent coming off the bench makes that one of our strongest 
departments now." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan started at shortstop, replacing Dave Anderson, who had been 
scheduled to replace Alfredo Griffin. . . . Griffin sprained his right thumb 
when he slipped and fell leaving the batter's box during Monday night's game. 
X-rays taken Tuesday were negative. The thumb was wrapped, but Griffin was able 
to take batting and fielding practice. He is on a day-to-day basis, Manager Tom 
Lasorda said. . . . Anderson was a late lineup scratch because of shoulder 
discomfort, a Dodger spokesman said. . . . Ramon Martinez continues to roll at 
Albuquerque. He is 5-0 with a 1.48 earned-run average.

MORNING BRIEFING: STAR(R)ING MOMENT COMES IN A PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What kind of man pinch-hits for Ted Williams? How about Bill Starr, a career 
minor leaguer who played only 13 games in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
According to Starr's book, "Clearing the Bases," it happened in 1937, when both 
were playing for San Diego in the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a tie game with Seattle. We had a man on first with nobody out in 
the last of the ninth, Ted Williams at bat, facing a righty pitcher. Our 
manager, Frank Shellenback, had Williams swinging, and he hit a foul -- Strike 
1. Shellenback then pulled Williams, who was never called upon to bunt, and 
sent me up." 
</P>
<P>
Starr bunted foul and then struck out. He went on to a lackluster career as a 
player, although he later owned the PCL Padres. Forever after, though, he could 
silence critics by saying, "I was good enough to pinch-hit for Ted Williams." 
</P>
<P>
Bet the IRS knows: Manager Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds, the subject of a 
gambling investigation, professes to be amused by the allegations of his 
betting habits, allegations that vary wildly. 
</P>
<P>
"One week, you owe someone $700,000," he said. "The next week, I win money at 
the track. Do I owe it or own it?" 
</P>
<P>
You call this a goon? Donnie Poole is a journeyman fighter whose claim to fame, 
so far, is that the Washington Capitals once hired him to "instruct" their 
hockey players during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Poole told Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post that player response was 
varied. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Pivonka, for instance, fresh from Czechoslovakia, where fighting on the 
ice is forbidden, couldn't even make a fist. On the other hand, Dwight 
Schofield was so willing a student that he immediately challenged Poole to a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield, one of the few Capitals who did not figure to need instruction, at 
6-foot-3 and 195 pounds, compared with Poole, 5-5 and 150. Schofield was the 
resident goon. 
</P>
<P>
"I agreed to fight him," Poole said. "He was all prepared for it. He had 
headgear, boots and a cup. I had nothing. I said, 'I'll box you, but just don't 
hit me in the mouth, because I don't have a mouthpiece.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schofield's first punch was at Poole's mouth. Poole ducked, came up with a left 
hook and knocked Schofield cold. Schofield was traded a week later. 
</P>
<P>
It's only a dream: Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda has lost 22 pounds since he began 
his diet. But at some cost, of course. He told Scott Newman of the Pasadena 
Star-News, "I see giant clams in my sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Now he knows how those clams used to feel. 
</P>
<P>
What no-hitter? Not just anybody breaks up Nolan Ryan's no-hitters in the ninth 
inning. So far the panel includes Dick Allen, Reggie Jackson and Mike Schmidt. 
Oh, also Nelson Liriano, whose career batting average is .256. He's the only 
other guy, besides Ted Williams, Bill Starr could hit for. 
</P>
<P>
Liriano would have stood in: Was Ryan always an intimidating pitcher? We'd have 
to say yes. As a high school senior he once began a game by splitting the 
batting helmet of the first hitter and breaking an arm of the second. 
</P>
<P>
"The third guy," Ryan remembered, "begged not to hit." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Cleveland Indian reliever Doug Jones, asked if he goes into another 
state of mind when he's in a save situation: "I don't know anyone who goes into 
another mental state, except that Oil Can Boyd."

KNICKS COMPLETE SWEEP WITH OVERTIME WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gerald Wilkins' 18-foot jumper with six seconds left in overtime gave the New 
York Knicks a 116-115 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Tuesday night and a 
sweep of their first-round Eastern Conference playoff series at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, who won the first two games of the best-of-five series at New York, 
will meet the winner of the Chicago-Cleveland series. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks trailed, 115-114, with 12 seconds left when Charles Oakley threw the 
ball inbounds to Wilkins, who took several dribbles, pulled up and scored over 
the 76ers' Maurice Cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley, who led Philadelphia with 29 points, got one more shot for the 
76ers, but the ball caromed off the rim as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Jackson led the Knicks with 24 points, including three from three-point 
range. He got help from Wilkins, who had 22 points, and Johnny Newman and 
Oakley, who each had 17. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the overtime period, Wilkins and Newman scored on layups to 
give the Knicks a 110-106 lead. But jumpers by Ron Anderson and Barkley tied it 
with 3:42 left. Barkley then took a pass underneath from Anderson and dunked it 
to give Philadelphia a 112-110 lead with 2:40 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
New York's 7-foot center, Patrick Ewing, who scored only eight points and was 
in foul trouble most of the game, made two free throws for a tie with 2:17 to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
With 54 seconds left, Tucker made a jumper from the corner that gave the Knicks 
a 114-112 lead. Gerald Henderson's three-pointer put the 76ers back on top with 
45 seconds left and then came Wilkins' winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 100, Boston 85 -- It was only the second time in 36 playoff seasons 
that the Celtics, who have a National Basketball Assn.-high 16 titles, failed 
to win a postseason game. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit outscored Boston, 27-8, in the last 9:17 at Boston and, behind Vinnie 
Johnson's 25 points, completed a 3-0 sweep that ended the Celtics' shortest 
playoff season since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit held Boston to fewer than 100 points for the third consecutive game, 
and limited the Celtics to 30 points after they led, 55-51, at halftime. The 
Celtics had only 12 points in the fourth quarter after leading, 73-71, entering 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Celtics failed to survive the first round was 33 years ago, 
when they lost, 2-1, to Syracuse. They were swept for the first time since a 
4-0 loss to Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 117, Atlanta 113 -- Ricky Pierce scored a career-high 35 points and 
converted a go-ahead three-point play with 32 seconds left in overtime at 
Milwaukee as the Bucks took a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five Eastern Conference 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
After Pierce's three-point play gave Milwaukee a 112-109 lead, Atlanta's Reggie 
Theus scored with 19 seconds to go. But Milwaukee's Fred Roberts scored on a 
dunk and then made a free throw after a break-away foul to put the Bucks ahead, 
115-111, with 13 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Antoine Carr scored for Atlanta with five seconds left, but Sidney Moncrief 
made two free throws with three seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 130, Denver 121 -- The Suns' resurgence continued through the first 
round of their Western Conference series as they completed a three-game sweep 
at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers, recovering from a miserable first half, scored 19 of his 32 
points in the fourth quarter, and Phoenix rallied from a 23-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns played poorly in the first half, and trailed, 72-54, at halftime. 
Denver extended its lead to 84-61 early in the third quarter on Michael Adams' 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
But Phoenix closed the deficit to 101-88 at the end of the period and then 
rallied in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Nuggets, 42-20. The Suns made 
their first 13 shots and shot 17 for 22 in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Denver, playing without injured starters Fat Lever and Danny Schayes, was led 
by Walter Davis with 26 points. Alex English and Adams each had 22. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, who had only five points on one-of-nine shooting in the first half, 
shared scoring honors with Kevin Johnson, who also had 32 points, 15 in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, scoring on jumpers, dunks and free throws, had 15 points in the first 
five minutes of the fourth quarter, helping the Suns close the gap to 114-109.

<P>
METS' OJEDA GETS FIRST VICTORY SINCE ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Ojeda pitched a five-hitter through eight innings for his first victory 
since nearly severing his left middle finger last September as the resurging 
New York Mets beat the struggling Atlanta Braves, 7-1, Tuesday night at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Mets' eighth victory in nine games, and the Braves' eighth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Ojeda (1-3) almost severed the upper portion of the finger on his pitching hand 
with an electric clipper last Sept. 21. He had a 6.38 earned-run average 
entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ojeda, who also had two singles, struck out two and walked one. He lost the 
shutout in the eighth when Jeff Blauser hit a single, went to second on Darryl 
Strawberry's fielding error in right field and scored on Lonnie Smith's double. 
Don Aase pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry gave the Mets a 2-0 lead in the first inning with his sixth homer 
after Howard Johnson walked and stole second. The homer came off Pete Smith 
(0-4). 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Cincinnati 4 -- Otis Nixon's two-out RBI single in the eighth 
inning broke a 3-3 tie and led the Expos to victory at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Spike Owen doubled just inside the first base bag off reliever Kent Tekulve 
(0-1) to start the decisive rally. Nixon then hit a single to right and scored 
on Tim Raines' single. 
</P>
<P>
Raines went to second on the throw home and scored on Tom Foley's single to 
make it 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Griffey homered in the ninth for Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 12, Philadelphia 4 -- Glenn Davis hit a two-run homer and an RBI 
single, and Kevin Bass was four for five and scored two runs as the Astros won 
at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Doran had three hits and three RBIs in Houston's biggest offensive game of 
the season. The loss was the Phillies' sixth in their last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Deshaies (3-2) allowed nine hits, struck out three and walked three in 
eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, which had 17 hits, scored a run in the first on Doran's RBI double. 
But Philadelphia got two in the bottom of the first on Mike Schmidt's home run 
after Von Hayes walked. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros scored four times in the second, knocking out starter Floyd Youmans 
(1-3). 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 7, St. Louis 1 -- Jack Clark got his first hit against his former 
Cardinal teammates, a three-run homer, and Ed Whitson pitched a six-hitter at 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Cardinals' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who went 0 for 4 in San Diego's first game against St. Louis Monday 
night, drove Scott Terry's pitch over the center-field wall to ignite the 
Padres' five-run third inning. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego sent 10 batters to the plate against Terry (3-2), who gave up six 
hits and two walks, one intentional, in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who left St. Louis as a free agent after the 1987 season to sign with 
the New York Yankees, boosted his home run total to five, all since April 14. 
He came to San Diego last October in a trade with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Chicago 0 -- Kevin Mitchell hit his seventh home run and Rich 
(Goose) Gossage got his first save as a Giant in this game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Gossage, released by the Cubs during spring training, signed with the Giants 
just before the season began. He came on for Rick Reuschel with the bases 
loaded and one out in the eighth. Gossage got Vance Law to pop out and Shawon 
Dunston to ground out. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Gossage struck out two, and earned his 303rd save, the most of 
any active pitcher.

GRAND SLAM BY WOOD SPARKS RAIDERS' GAME-WINNING RALLY IN NINTH, 9-4 
</P>

<P>
Loyd Wood expected to get a pitch that he could hit and he was not 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Wood blasted a Leif Christoffersen offering over the right-center-field fence 
for a grand slam to lead a five-run, ninth-inning rally that powered Moorpark 
College to a 9-4 victory Tuesday over College of the Canyons in the first round 
of the Western State Conference Shaughnessy playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The loss eliminated the host Cougars (23-13), co-champions in the WSC with 
Ventura, from the five-team tournament. Valley, a 13-5 winner over Oxnard in 
the other playoff game, will play host to Moorpark at 2 p.m. Thursday for the 
right to meet Ventura in the championship game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Wood's blast capped a dramatic display that gave Moorpark its second win over 
the Cougars at Canyons this season. The win could not have come at a more 
opportune time for Coach Ron Stillwell, whose resignation becomes official at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't ask me how we win here," Stillwell said. "I haven't been able to win 
here for years. It was sweet today." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars almost escaped the ninth inning unscathed, but third baseman Alex 
Bartarse's throwing error with two out gave the Raiders new life. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 4-4, Moorpark had runners on first and third with two out 
when Craig Pearson grounded to Bartarse, who threw wildly to second base, 
allowing Don Smith to score the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had led off the ninth with a single, advanced to second on Dan Smith's 
sacrifice bunt and moved to third on Darin Furlong's ground out. Steve Sisco 
was walked intentionally before Pearson grounded to Bartarse. 
</P>
<P>
After Pearson's grounder, Christoffersen hit Kris Kaelin with a pitch to load 
the bases. Wood then worked Christoffersen to a three-and-one count before 
unloading on his next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"With that pitcher, I knew he couldn't throw it by me," Wood said. "I was 
expecting a fat one and I got it." 
</P>
<P>
Wood's homer spoiled Canyons' game-tying rally in the eighth. Designated-hitter 
Pete Washington blasted a two-run homer over the left-field fence to tie the 
score, 4-4. The loss also snapped the Cougars' eight-game win streak and ended 
Canyons' season only a day after the Cougars had clinched a share of their 
ninth consecutive WSC title. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman right-hander John Chiaramonte (6-3) went the distance for the win. The 
Raiders turned double plays in the fifth and the eighth and Chiaramonte pitched 
out of trouble several times to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a battler and he did a good job," Canyons Coach Len Mohney said of 
Chiaramonte. "We had some chances against him, but he pitched tough in the 
clutch." 
</P>
<P>
Canyons took a 1-0 lead on Don Pedersen's run-scoring single to right in the 
first, knocking in Gary Morgan. The Cougars' leadoff batter reached base in 
four of the first five innings, but Canyons capitalized only in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark moved ahead, 2-1, on Kaelin's two-run home run to right in the sixth, 
but Canyons tied the score on Chris Joy's homer to left, his 16th of the 
season, later in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Sisco's two-run homer to left with two out in the seventh gave Moorpark a 4-2 
lead. Sisco had two singles and a homer to lead Moorpark (23-15).

CHATSWORTH'S WALLACE HURLS NO-HITTER, 6-0; 
</P>
<P>
CHANCELLOR PITCHER OVERCOMES WILD STREAK TO SHUT DOWN KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Funny game, baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Tuesday's performance by Derek Wallace, a senior right-hander at 
Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace walked five batters, hit three others with fastballs -- one smack 
between the shoulder blades -- and shaved the chins of several others with a 
slider that often seemed to be slip-sliding away. 
</P>
<P>
"One just slipped out of my hand," Wallace said, explaining one beaning. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't give up a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wallace considered the effort a "lousy" performance. Even Chatsworth 
Coach Bob Lofrano remarked afterward, "That's as bad a control as he's ever 
exhibited in two years." 
</P>
<P>
But what's so funny? Manny Alvarado and the Kennedy Golden Cougars are not 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"He no-hit us," Alvarado said, seemingly at a loss for words. "He pitched a 
great game." 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, Wallace did pitch a no-hitter. But let's leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth (18-4, 11-2 in league play) blanked Kennedy, 6-0, in a Northwest 
Valley Conference game at Chatsworth. Wallace (9-1), who struck out five, 
survived control problems to become the first Chatsworth player to throw a 
no-hitter in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Said a perplexed Lofrano: "There are no answers to this game." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, his own worst critic, described his performance in a word: 
</P>
<P>
"Brutal" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kinda disappointed in my mechanics, just the way I'm throwing the ball." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter how Wallace was throwing, the Golden Cougars weren't hitting. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (16-6, 10-3) had runners on base in five of the seven innings, loading 
the bases in the first and putting two runners on in three other innings. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, however, slammed the door each time. 
</P>
<P>
He escaped the first inning by retiring Danny Gugler on a soft bouncer to third 
baseman Rich Aude. With one out in the third and runners at the corners, Aude 
gloved a hard grounder by Travis Bourne to begin an around-the-horn double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace struck out Gino Tagliaferri swinging with the bases empty to end the 
fifth inning, and second baseman Vince Simili and center fielder Kevin Chong 
each snared ropes to keep the Golden Cougars hitless in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit the ball sharply a few times," Alvarado said, "but we couldn't find any 
holes. One timely hit, one timely break . . . we couldn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, things became so quiet you could hear a foul ball drop -- which 
one did, off the bat of Kennedy's Mike Murray. The ball fell just four feet 
from the right-field line and a certain bloop double. Murray fouled away three 
full-count pitches before drawing a walk to place runners at first and second. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought to myself, 'Just throw hard,' " Wallace said. "I think I just threw 
fastballs that last inning." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace then got Pat DeBoer, striking him out on three pitches to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano, ordinarily reserved in victory, charged onto the field and embraced 
Wallace, who joined Brian Wood in the Chatsworth record books. Wood hurled a 
rain-shortened, five-inning no-hitter against Reseda in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course you want to see him get it," said Lofrano, who paced the dugout and 
barked encouragement in the final inning. "But the game's the important thing." 
</P>
<P>
The win snapped a two-game losing skid for the Chancellors, who remained two 
games ahead of Taft in the West Valley League race with four games to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to look at this thing in the overall scheme and not get all bent out of 
shape," Lofrano said. "But we obviously needed something after struggling a 
little. We put the bat on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Chancellors collected 11 hits off senior Mitch Cizek (7-3), whose personal 
seven-game winning streak was snapped. Aude, who was two for three, lofted a 
sacrifice fly to cap Chatsworth's two-run first. He also had a run-scoring 
double in the third and a run-scoring single in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Aude, who entered the game batting a team-high .443, finished the game with 31 
runs batted in, tops in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth scored three times in the third to take a 5-0 lead. After Aude drove 
in Simili, Eric Johnson, Wallace and Reed McMackin followed with singles.

STATWATCH: CORRALES, TAGLIAFERRI DUEL FOR NORTH VALLEY RBI TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both are seniors and both are shortstops. They play in the same league and both 
bat third and wear uniform No. 15, but Bobby Corrales of San Fernando and Gino 
Tagliaferri of Kennedy are decidedly different hitters. They are, however, neck 
and neck in the race for the North Valley League leadership in runs batted in 
with five regular-season games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into this week's games, the power-hitting Tagliaferri had five doubles, 
two triples, eight home runs and a .371 average in 70 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Corrales, a contact hitter who had two doubles and no home runs, was batting 
.437 and had struck out just twice in 71 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Although their methods have been different, the results have been the same: As 
of Monday, Corrales had 29 RBIs and Tagliaferri had 28. 
</P>
<P>
All-around: Pat Bryant is surely Cleveland's fastest player -- in fact, he is 
second among Valley-area City Section players with 17 stolen bases -- but he 
also shares or holds the team lead in six additional offensive categories. 
Bryant, a junior outfielder, leads the team in hits (24), batting average 
(.453), runs scored (17), extra-base hits (eight), doubles (three) and home 
runs (three). He also ranks second with two triples, and, despite batting in 
the leadoff position, is tied for second in RBIs with 11. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he is at the plate or on the mound, Chris DeCristo of Chaminade is one 
reason why the Eagles (9-11, 4-2) are tied for first with Notre Dame and La 
Salle in the San Fernando Valley League standings. DeCristo is batting .316 
with three home runs and 10 RBIs in league play, including game-winning RBIs 
against Harvard and St. Genevieve. The left-handed senior is 2-0 with a 1.04 
earned-run average in league play. In 6 2/3 innings, DeCristo has given up two 
hits, struck out six and walked six. 
</P>
<P>
Home runs: Chatsworth's failure to hit a home run in two losses to San Fernando 
last week undoubtedly made the Tigers' upset sweep easier. The Chancellors 
entered the series with 18, and four players had hit three or more. At the 
other end of the spectrum, catcher Rudy Sanchez led San Fernando in home runs 
with one. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: Ponder the production of junior first baseman Ryan McGuire of El 
Camino Real. McGuire, last season's Cal-Hi Sports sophomore Player of the Year, 
has only eight hits and is batting just .211. Yet his on-base percentage is 
.490. McGuire has reached base 25 times in 51 plate appearances and has scored 
eight runs. He has 13 walks and has struck out six times. 
</P>
<P>
Hart is batting .346 and has four players hitting better than .400. The Indians 
have 66 extra-base hits -- 41 of which are doubles -- a .465 on-base percentage 
and 58 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus' Matt Tull is batting a team-high .460 -- a .593 average in Golden 
League play -- and has an overall on-base percentage of .748. He has walked 20 
times, leads the team with nine doubles and has struck out only four times. 
</P>
<P>
In his past seven games, Royal center fielder Jason Jones has 15 hits in 21 
at-bats, including four home runs, nine RBIs and 11 runs scored. With three 
games left, Jones has 32 hits, eight shy of the school record set by Dan 
Russell in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Cohen of El Camino Real was six for seven last week, raising his average 
from .387 to a team-high .473. Cohen had three doubles, one triple and five 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching: Saugus' team earned-run average is 2.28 but the combined ERA of 
starters Roger Salkeld (0.72) and Scott Warr (1.65) is only 0.95. . . . Hart 
pitchers have a combined ERA of 1.99, 103 strikeouts and 31 walks. 
</P>
<P>
Records: This has been a record-breaking season at Newbury Park (17-2-3), No. 1 
in The Times' Valley poll. Danny Madsen has set the single-season RBI record at 
30 but is being chased by Geoff Black (29), who also has tied the record for 
home runs (6) and runs scored (31). Black, a senior outfielder, has seven 
doubles, three short of the school mark, and his 36 hits are four shy of 
another record. 
</P>
<P>
Stolen bases: Westlake's Tim Falsken was caught stealing for the first time 
this year when he was thrown out by Mark Contreras of Channel Islands last 
week. His 19 steals are a school record and four shy of the school career 
record. 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve has stolen 63 bases in 72 attempts (87.5%). Mike Cassidy is 14 of 
16, Carlos Concha is 12 of 14 and Joe Cascione is perfect in 10 attempts.

PECK SHAKES OFF ILLNESS AND PLAGUES OPPONENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Chrissy Peck of El Camino Real High set some lofty goals for herself before the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The first was to help the Conquistadores (18-2) win their second consecutive 
City Section title and sixth in the past seven years. The second was to throw a 
no-hitter and the third was to pitch a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
While Peck considered all three goals attainable, she never expected to 
accomplish the second one -- a no-hitter -- two days after returning to school 
from a two-week bout with chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to pitch the entire game," said Peck (17-2), 
who struck out nine and walked two in beating Canoga Park, 15-0, last Tuesday. 
"I'm really out of shape right now. I didn't have much velocity on the ball and 
I really got tired in the later innings." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after blanking Canoga Park, Peck pitched 6 1/3 innings of no-hit ball 
against Taft before finishing with a two-hitter and a 26-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Although she lost to Newbury Park, 5-0, in the Thousand Oaks tournament 
Saturday morning, Peck pitched a one-hitter and struck out 14 in an 11-1 
victory over Redlands that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"She actually pitched stronger in the tournament than during the no-hitter," El 
Camino Real Coach Neils Ludlow said. "Her velocity was better and she had more 
endurance as the week went on." 
</P>
<P>
Peck transferred from El Camino Real to Bel-Air Prep as a freshman to 
concentrate on her studies but returned to the Woodland Hills campus for this, 
her junior season. 
</P>
<P>
But Ludlow, in his fifth year at El Camino Real, reckons that the 
Conquistadores' storied past might have influenced Peck's decision to return. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more people are going to know about Chrissy if she's pitching here than 
if she's pitching at Bel-Air Prep," Ludlow said. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Silverman, who graduated last June, might be the best-known player in El 
Camino Real softball history. She pitched the Conquistadores to City titles in 
1985 (over Banning), '86 (Canoga Park) and '88 (San Pedro). 
</P>
<P>
Ludlow said that Peck, with 182 strikeouts in 125 innings and an 0.50 
earned-run average, is like Silverman in many respects. 
</P>
<P>
"Beth and Chrissy both have very good velocity on their fastballs," Ludlow 
said. "They both throw the rise, the drop, the changeup and the curveball with 
equal efficiency."

SAN FERNANDO SQUANDERS 4-RUN LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino Real rallied for two runs in the sixth inning, then four in the 
seventh and erased a four-run deficit to shock San Fernando, 6-4, in a 
Northwest Valley Conference game at San Fernando on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando led, 4-0, through five innings behind senior right-hander Frank 
Serna (6-3). After scoring two runs in the sixth, the Conquistadores banged up 
Serna and relievers John Najar and Hector De La Cruz in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Geller and Ryan McGuire opened the seventh with doubles to make it 4-3. 
After Jason Cohen singled McGuire to third, Serna was relieved by Najar, who 
gave up a game-tying single to Bobby Kim. 
</P>
<P>
Del Marine followed with an run-scoring double, driving in Cohen. After De La 
Cruz relieved Najar, Jeff Marks drove in Kim from third with a squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Patrick Treend (3-3) pitched his third consecutive complete game 
for the Conquistadores. San Fernando (15-4-1, 9-3-1 in league play) stranded 10 
baserunners, including two in the the seventh. The Tigers remain a half-game 
behind Kennedy in the North Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
In other Northwest Valley Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 12, Canoga Park 1 -- Gabe Miller pitched a five-hitter and had 
three hits as Granada Hills won its first conference game of the season, at 
Lanark Park. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 3-1, after six innings, the Highlanders exploded for nine runs on 
seven hits in the top of the seventh. Bill Biers and Tom Condos both had 
two-run singles in the inning for Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 7, Cleveland 6 -- Designated-hitter Geoff Ruch's two-out blooper to center 
fell between Cleveland outfielders Sean Burwell and Pat Bryant for the 
game-winning RBI in the eighth inning at Cleveland. Ruch's double scored Brett

WILLIAMSON SETS PACE IN MARMONTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks High had the leading qualifying times in the 
800 and 1,600 meters to highlight the Marmonte League boys' track and field 
prelims Tuesday at Camarillo High. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, runner-up in last year's state Division I cross-country 
championships, ran a personal best of 1 minute, 58.8 seconds to win the first 
heat of the 800 and took the second heat of the 1,600 in 4:29.2. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson originally was expected to run in the 1,600 and 3,200 in the league 
finals at Camarillo on Friday evening but he might run in the 800 as well, 
according to Thousand Oaks assistant Jim Dunlap. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't decided for sure, but he'll probably run in all three events," 
Dunlap said. "We're looking to win the team title, and Mike could get us some 
big points in the 800 as well as the 1,600 and 3,200." 
</P>
<P>
The top three finishers in each event in the league finals qualify for the 
Southern Section 4-A Division prelims the following week, but Dunlap said that 
Williamson will drop the 800 if he qualifies in that event. 
</P>
<P>
Hurdler Charles Brown of Channel Islands and sprinter David Brownlee of 
Westlake also had leading qualifying marks in two events. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the defending league champion in the 110-meter high hurdles and the 
300-meter intermediate hurdles, ran 14.4 seconds in the highs and 39.8 in the 
intermediates to win his heats. 
</P>
<P>
Brownlee ran 11.0 in the 100 and 22.1 in the 200 to win the first heats in 
those events. Jack Bellamy of Thousand Oaks and Phillip Antoine of Newbury Park 
also ran 11.0 to win the second and third heats of the 100. 
</P>
<P>
In other prelims: 
</P>
<P>
Channel League -- Patrick Van Scoy of host Rio Mesa set a school record of 55 
feet, 1 1/2 inches in the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
Van Scoy, a sophomore, improved his personal best by 13 inches and also led 
qualifying in the discus (157-5). Teammates Eric Thomas and Lester Smith also 
had leading qualifying marks. Thomas leaped 6-6 in the high jump and Lester 
Smith bounded 45-2 in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
Other Spartan qualifiers included Scott Guerrero in the 400 (51.3) and 800 
(2:01.4), Jeff Garner in the high jump (6-2) and Jeff Betancourt (46-9 1/2) in 
the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
Del Rey League -- Russell White of Crespi and Tony Borquez of Alemany had the 
fastest qualifying marks in the 100 and 400 meters at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
White won the second heat of the 100 in 10.8 and Borquez won the first heat of 
the 400 in 48.7. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany freshman Brian Brison ran 10.9 in the 100 and Jim Nau of Crespi ran 
39.8 to win the first heat of the 300 intermediate hurdles.

Torrey Pines 8, Orange Glen 0 -- John Lynch threw 113 pitches, struck out 11

DeFrancesca went two for three. Orange Glen fell to 10-12, 3-5.

Mt. Carmel 2, Poway 1 -- Two runners, one for each side, were thrown out at the 
plate in the sixth inning. Mt. Carmel finally won it in the seventh. After John 
Tejcek opened the inning with a triple, the next two batters were intentionally 
walked to load the bases. A.J. Forlano then hit a sacrifice fly to score Tejcek 
with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook 7, Vista 4 -- Fallbrook scored all of its runs in the fourth, three 
of which came in on Erik Larson's double. Mike Gainsborough went three for four

the season. 
</P>
<P>
City Central League 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine 6, Hoover 5 -- Albert Canedo's grand slam home run in the fifth

</P>
<P>
City Western League 
</P>
<P>
USDHS 19, LaJolla 5 -- Tom Shanner (6-0) remained undefeated at the mound for

VALHALLA, SAN DIEGO HIGH SOCCER TEAMS WILL PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be an interesting preliminary to tonight's opening-round MISL 
playoff game between the Sockers and Dallas Sidekicks at the Sports Arena: The 
boys' soccer teams from Valhalla and San Diego High Schools will play at 4:40 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It's a rematch of their grueling, 100-minute (including overtimes) San Diego 
Section 2-A championship game, which was played two months ago and ended at 
1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Stoff, Sockers' publicity man, suggested the game. The problem was that 
players from both teams had other commitments -- mostly to the State Cup Youth 
Soccer -- and couldn't agree on a date. Another problem now is that high school 
soccer is out of season, so CIF rules prohibit either team from officially 
representing its school. 
</P>
<P>
So tonight, San Diego and Valhalla will "unofficially" play. San Diego will 
wear blue jerseys, and Valhalla will wear white. The game will last an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a fun thing, but still, that co-championship is hanging over 
everyone's head," San Diego Coach Milton Hidalgo said. "I suppose there will be 
some bragging rights afterward, but it's pretty informal." 
</P>
<P>
The game is supposed to be so informal that Stoff invited the coaches to play 
as well. Hidalgo said he will probably sit out unless the Valhalla coaches 
participate. He doesn't want to take the spotlight away from the players. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I said I'd play, but now I think I'll stay back," Hidalgo said. "When 
you're (high school) age, you're competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the Sports Arena will be different than playing on a high school 
football field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different game," Hidalgo said. "You can't decide outdoor championships 
indoors." 
</P>
<P>
No, but bragging rights can be had at either place. 
</P>
<P>
Final plans are being made for the AAU-Soviet Basketball Tour's May 13 stop in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The game between the Soviets and the San Diego Select All-Star team will begin 
at 7:30 p.m. at Peterson Gym at San Diego State. A preliminary between the San 
Diego County Sheriffs and the San Diego Police Department will begin at 5 p.m. 
Opening ceremonies for the main event -- a gift exchange, presentation of the 
flags and national anthems -- will begin at 7:10. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-player San Diego team roster includes Brooks Barnhard (Escondido High 
School, senior, 6-feet-9), David Berteaux (La Jolla, senior, 6-0), Tony Clark 
(Valhalla, junior, 6-7), Kevin Flanagan (Torrey Pines, senior, 6-9), Terrence 
Hamilton (Patrick Henry, senior, 6-6), Clark James (San Diego, junior, 6-6), 
Chris Johnson (Crawford, senior, 6-2), Ray McDavid (Clairemont, senior, 6-2), 
Joe McNaull (Monte Vista, junior, 6-9), Eric Meek (San Pasqual, sophomore, 
6-10), Courtie Miller (Torrey Pines, senior, 6-7), Milton Miller (San Diego, 
senior, 6-6), Todd Swanson (El Camino, senior, 6-1), Joe Temple (Lincoln, 
senior, 6-3) and Aaron Wilhite (Lincoln, senior, 6-7). 
</P>
<P>
Tickets, priced at $25 and $10, are available at Police Athletic League 
headquarters (121 Broadway, Suite 339) or by calling PAL at 231-9567. Proceeds 
benefit PAL. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego high school version of the Yankees' 1927 Murderers' Row can be 
found at Crawford, where the Colts are averaging 9.9 runs a game, 13.5 in City 
Central League play. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Eric Turner is batting .506, outfielder-pitcher Chris Townsend 
.443, second baseman Todd Davis .421, third baseman Manny Gagliano .418, first 
baseman John Edge .339, outfielder-designated hitter Joe McWilliams .381, 
catcher Josh Neil .368 and shortstop Jeff Thrift .379. Gagliano leads the team 
with six home runs and 32 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we've certainly scored our share of runs," Crawford Coach Roger Engle 
said. "And it's not like we're nickel-and-diming people. Our slugging 
percentage is .534. But there isn't a lot of real great pitching in our 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's 8-0 victory over Christian was the first time Crawford (18-3, 10-0) 
hadn't scored in double figures in seven games. Before Christian, Crawford 
defeated San Diego, 17-2; Hoover, 18-5; St. Augustine, 18-6; Lincoln, 19-9, and 
Christian, 10-4. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Board of Managers met Tuesday and took care of a few items that 
will be on the agenda Friday at the State Federated Council meeting in 
Berkeley: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They decided to vote against a referral at the state meeting to divide the 
boys' and girls' state basketball championships into separate venues. 
</P>
<P>
Playing all five boys' division championships at the Oakland Coliseum and all 
five girls' championships at a site in Southern California has been discussed. 
The San Diego Section voted to not only vote against separating the boys and 
girls but also to vote against separating Divisions I, II, III from Divisions 
IV and V in both the boys' and girls' championships, as was the case this year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They voted to support Plan C regarding a baseball pitching limit, which 
states that no pitcher will be allowed to throw more than 10 innings in a 
three-day period. The national federation has mandated that each state must 
enforce a pitching limit beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
High School Notes 
</P>
<P>
The section Board of Managers also voted to accept Fundamental Baptist Academy 
(Escondido) as the 76th member school in the section. Commissioner Kendall Webb 
said he expects Fundamental Baptist, which only has 20 students in grades 
nine-12, to field cross country and junior varsity basketball teams. . . . The 
San Diego Section 3-A and 2-A baseball championships will be held at the 
University of San Diego's Cunningham Stadium.

SPORTS ET CETERA: CHARGERS SIGN SEVEN FREE AGENTS, INCLUDING NEW QUARTERBACK'S 
FAVORITE RECEIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers announced the signing of seven free agents Tuesday, including wide 
receiver Wayne Walker, who was Billy Joe Tolliver's prime target at Texas Tech 
last year. The Chargers selected quarterback Tolliver in the second round of 
the April 23 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Walker caught 100 passes for a Texas Tech record 2,007 yards in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other six free agents signed was safety Shawn Hicks, formerly of 
Kearny High School and Chico State. 
</P>
<P>
The other five: safety Michael Brooks of North Carolina State, tight end Craig 
Davis of Southern University, USC linebacker John Moore, inside linebacker Bob 
Sebring of Illinois and defensive end Ed Washington. The Chargers listed no 
college for Washington, who played three seasons with the Los Angeles Express 
of the defunct USFL. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College dropped a Golden State Athletic Conference 
doubleheader to visiting California Lutheran, 6-2 and 7-5. Cal Lutheran scored 
two runs in the 10th inning to win the nightcap. Cal Lutheran is now 29-15 and 
15-7; Point Loma Nazarene dropped to 20-26 and 8-16. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nine runs scored in University of San Diego's 7-2 victory over UCSD, 
only one was earned -- and even that came in on a passed ball. USD's Paul 
Thornton scored on the fifth-inning passed ball and when batter Andy Roberts 
later singled, the run was considered as earned. Roberts finished with three 
hits and two RBIs. UCSD's Gene Northway also had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State lost to Utah, 5-1, in the semifinals of the Western Athletic 
Conference tournament in Albuquerque, N.M. Tole Marinkovic was SDSU's lone 
winner, defeating Brendan Bowyer, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, at No. 2 singles. The Aztecs 
will play Air Force today for third place. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Kelvin Means, a sophomore guard for the University of San Diego, has decided to 
transfer to to another school to play football. He said he most likely will go 
to Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Means (6-feet, 170 pounds) was an All-State receiver his senior year at St. 
John Bosco High in Bellflower. Bosco went 13-1 that year, the only loss coming 
to Crespi High in the Big 5 Conference championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Means will have three years of eligibility in football. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision out of high school whether to play football or 
basketball," Means said. "I chose basketball, but football never left my mind. 
If I was going to try it, I had to do it now." 
</P>
<P>
Means chose Fresno State because he was heavily recruited by the university out 
of high school. 
</P>
<P>
"When we recruited him, I knew he was more talented as a football player than a 
basketball player," said Hank Egan, USD coach. "I was surprised he chose 
basketball, but I was also surprised when he came and told me (a month ago) he 
wanted to leave." 
</P>
<P>
This season Means started 15 of 28 games and averaged 2.3 points and 1.3 
rebounds for the Toreros.

JILL IRELAND: HER STORY OF RESILIENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
Life Lines by Jill Ireland (Warner Books: $19.95; 352 pages) 
</P>
<P>
By now, you've probably seen a lot of ink about actress Jill Ireland and her 
new book, "Life Lines," an account of her son's struggle with drug addiction. 
In these very pages, we've learned that Ireland is again battling for her life 
against cancer -- a once-successful battle that was the subject of her 1984 
best seller, "Life Wish." Even so, she is making plans to play herself in a 
movie based on "Life Lines." Now, after all the hype, comes the chance to 
actually read the book itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Pain is inevitable," Ireland writes of the break-up of her marriage to actor 
David McCallum and her love affair with Charles Bronson -- but the phrase also 
describes each of the hurts and losses, great and small, that are recounted in 
"Life Lines." From her short prologue -- an unattended miscarriage in a German 
hotel room -- to the sustained account of her son's heroin and cocaine 
addiction, Ireland has composed nothing less than a fugue of excruciating but 
poignant memories: her distant recollections of a stay in a hospital at the age 
of 11 months ('The sense of loss, the loneliness and isolation were more than 
my little girl's mind could absorb"); the imagined outrage of her adopted son, 
torn from his natural mother at birth and handed to a stranger ("Small nostrils 
flared, seeking the smell of her, but he could not find it. The yearning grew 
worse"); the death of a beloved friend ("Her face was made up in a way that did 
not seem quite right," she writes of the open-casket funeral. "I redid her 
hair, pulling it forward over her brow the way she used to wear it."). 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Ireland tells two tales of grief in parallel narratives. One is 
about the devastating ill health -- "ulcerated colitis and Crohn's disease . . 
. a colostomy, three intestinal surgeries, a trio of heart attacks, open-heart 
surgery involving five bypasses, and subsequently a series of strokes" -- that 
afflicted her charming father, Jack Ireland, whose "touch of the streets spiked 
my blood and strengthened my character." And the other is about the alcohol, 
cocaine and heroin addiction that tormented her adopted son: "A malevolent star 
had cast a shadow on the light that should have shone protectively around 
Jason." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short Bursts of Prose 
</P>
<P>
Ireland writes in short, intense bursts of prose, and each brief chapter is 
full of observation and incident: a remembered fragment of song, an endearing 
family ritual, a naughty limerick recited by the cherished grandfather. 
Surprisingly, the book is not a dirge -- Ireland is a doughty and vivacious 
storyteller who is quick to reassure us with moments of tenderness and joy. But 
she is also a virtuoso at playing the heartstrings. And, sometimes, it's all a 
bit too contrived, as when she sets up a 70-word chapter in order to depict her 
young daughter crying over a fearful separation from mother: "But, Mama, I'm 
just a little girl," young Zuleika pleads. "You are my lifeline." 
</P>
<P>
At center stage in "Life Lines" of course, is Jason. Of the seven children that 
she has raised, Ireland writes, "Jason was the only serious casualty, an 
innocent bystander, shot by the stray bullets of decisions made years before he 
was born -- marriages that did not work out, concepts of child-rearing passed 
on from different eras and cultures. . . ." Young Jason was a bedwetter, an 
asthma sufferer, a victim of dyslexia and hyperkinesia and -- much later -- a 
drug addict. And Ireland torments herself over why Jason was so afflicted -- 
was it because he was separated from his natural mother at birth? Or because 
Ireland so readily acknowledged that he was adopted "in my 
let's-keep-everything-out-in-the-open idealistic attitude"? At the end of "Life 
Lines," however, we are given other, far more squalid and terrifying 
explanations of Jason's ill fate. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he reached adolescence, Jason "spun out into the world with the 
abandon of a banshee." We witness his first love affair, at the age of 16, with 
an older married woman who introduced him to champagne and cocaine, among other 
pleasures of the flesh -- Ireland hired a private detective to "bust" the 
real-life Mrs. Robinson. Later, while Ireland was undergoing chemotherapy 
during her first bout with cancer, she received the fateful telephone call: 
"The kid's on the needle," a doctor said of Jason. "He's an addict." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trials Eerily Alike 
</P>
<P>
The account of Jason's attempt to kick his habit is no less harrowing and 
horrific than Ireland's fight against breast cancer. Indeed, many of the 
medical and emotional trappings are eerily alike -- and the recurrence of 
Jason's addiction now strikes us as an augury of Ireland's own renewed struggle 
with cancer. "Although the cancer monster still sat on my shoulder, I carried 
my burden more easily," she writes. "The weight I could not and would never 
carry easily was the knot in my soul, the knowledge that my middle son was now 
and forever a drug addict. But for now, Jason was clean and I was taking a 
necessary respite from apprehension." 
</P>
<P>
The real hero of "Life Lines" is Jill Ireland herself. She mostly resists the 
temptation to depict herself as a rescuer or a martyr, but we come away from 
the book with the sense that she is a woman of tremendous strength and 
resilience, charm and courage. As her father said (in the last words he uttered 
before suffering a stroke): "You've been a real brick through all of this."

JOFFREY BALLET RENEWS SAN DIEGO ROMANCE WITH DIAGHILEV PROGRAM AS CENTERPIECE

<P>
When the Joffrey Ballet returns to San Diego tonight for a four-performance run 
at the Civic Theatre, it will be a homecoming of sorts for the company and an 
opportunity for San Diego balletomanes to renew an ongoing love affair with the 
first world-class dance troupe to include the city on its regular touring 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Joffrey started here (with the San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts) 
the same year it started the bicoastal arrangement with Los Angeles, so we've 
had a special bond since 1983," said Suzanne Townsend of San Diego 
Performances, local sponsors of the Joffrey. "After the glitz and glamour of 
L.A., and all the rigors of touring, they like to come here. It's like a safe 
haven." 
</P>
<P>
"We've always loved dancing in San Diego," said Joffrey artistic director 
Gerald Arpino by telephone from Houston. "Our romance with 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is an extension of our bicoastal commitment, and the audiences are 
wonderful to us." 
</P>
<P>
When Joffrey began its association with San Diego, Townsend and Danah Fayman 
were the dynamic duo who made it happen. Their pioneer efforts to package 
big-league dance as a series in San Diego are "very special" because of the 
scale and scope of their undertaking, Arpino said. 
</P>
<P>
What's on tap from the Joffrey this week? 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the Joffrey to do an all-Diaghilev evening because that 
reconstruction was so important to Robert Joffrey," said Townsend, who prides 
herself on taking an active role in selecting the repertory shown in San Diego. 
"The company wasn't here last year when it was their major artistic purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, a Diaghilev program is the centerpiece of this visit. Among the 
treasures on the historic program are "L'Apres Midi d'Un Faune" and "Le Sacre 
du Printemps," both by Vaslav Nijinsky, and Leonide Massine's "Parade." All 
three works are San Diego premieres, scheduled for 8 p.m. performances 
Wednesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's mix (repeated at 2 p.m. Friday) will feature the local debut of 
Eugene Loring's classic, "Billy the Kid," Frederick Ashton's "Monotones II," 
and a pair of works by Arpino never seen in San Diego before: "Sea Shadow" and 
"Viva Vivaldi." 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of shuffling, but you need to be thinking about growth when you 
plan the programs," Arpino said. 
</P>
<P>
Because he likes to think of his troupe as a catalyst for growth in regional 
dance, Arpino was ecstatic to learn that local troupe Three's Company will make 
its maiden appearance in New York this week, and that newcomers like Malashock 
and Company are emerging on the San Diego dance scene. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why Bob (the late founding director, Robert Joffrey) and I accepted the 
arrangement," Arpino said, referring to the troupe's getting involved with San 
Diego or any community. "Our vision has always been bigger than the company. 
It's about the American dance scene. It had to be." The company was created by 
the only two American directors of a major American ballet company, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe is dedicating this season to Robert Joffrey, who died in March, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Joffrey will enter into an agreement that will keep the company on 
the West Coast for six more weeks each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had friends at Cal State (Los Angeles) for years," Arpino said, "and 
recently the chancellor, said, 'What if I could offer you a residency here?' So 
they built a magnificent studio for us on campus, and we'll be mounting new 
works there. We won't be working with the students, but they'll have the 
ability to observe and learn and study -- and we'll have the ability to work 
without disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked in Iowa (at the University of Iowa) for four weeks, and we were able 
to mount our 'Nutcracker.' Of course, they helped underwrite it. It's a 
tremendous gift." 
</P>
<P>
As Arpino sees it, this kind of kinship with a university can be a boon to 
under-funded dance troupes. 
</P>
<P>
"Joffrey is always a pathfinder, looking for new ways of raising money for 
dance companies," he said. "Once the smaller companies see us doing it, it 
starts to catch on."

'SPUNK' SPINS SOME TERRIFIC YARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name Zora Neale Hurston is not a household word. But anyone who has read 
Alice Walker's "In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens," couldn't forget Walker's 
account of her pilgrimage to Hurston's grave or her placing of a headstone on 
it as the repayment of a literary debt -- and fulfillment of a personal 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
Hurston was a writer, anthropologist, folklorist, feminist (or, as Walker might 
prefer it, "womanist") and an altogether iconoclastic figure in her time 
(1903-1960). 
</P>
<P>
She was example and inspiration for Walker and novelist Toni Morrison, among 
others. And now playwright George C. Wolfe ("The Colored Museum") has done his 
thing to retrieve Hurston from the relative obscurity in which she has 
languished. Under the title "Spunk," Wolfe has put together a staged reading of 
three of Hurston's short stories (from a collection of her writings by the apt 
same name) for the Mark Taper's Sundays at the Itchey Foot. 
</P>
<P>
Run, don't walk -- but call first. 
</P>
<P>
The Itchey Foot is not large and word of mouth is going to spread like mercury 
on this one. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple: the stories are terrific yarns, the writer knows how to 
spin them -- and the five actors charged with reading them get so carried away 
they all but fall off their stools, pumping their vivid characters for all the 
juice that's in them. 
</P>
<P>
Hurston was a listener. She passionately believed in the inherent poetry of 
that idiosyncratic mixture of coined words and cajoling speech patterns we call 
black American. She defiantly secured her point by referring to herself as 
"Queen of the Niggerati." And she knew how to write in that language. The 
stories selected by Wolfe -- "Sweat," "The Gilded Six Bits" and "Story in 
Harlem Slang" -- crackle with the rhythms and effusive imagery of this rich, 
black speech. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweat" is a story of providence and vindication, wherein the hard-working 
washerwoman Delia (Loretta Devine) is saved from a life of unmitigated abuse 
and humiliation by her surly husband Sykes (Hawthorne James) through the 
backfiring of his own connivance. 
</P>
<P>
Who could wish for more providential or more poetic justice? 
</P>
<P>
"Story in Harlem Slang" is less story than it is jazz riff. As the title spells 
out, this is a lip-smacking collection of boasts and bravuras, delivered in a 
fugue of zesty Harlemese by competing hustlers (played to a fare-thee-well by 
Harry Waters Jr. and Bruce Beatty) -- until a woman they both target (Devine) 
comes sauntering down the street and, with a panache at least equivalent to 
theirs, proceeds to deflate their egos. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, Wolfe saves the most linear and compelling story for the last. 
In "The Gilded Six-Bits," we find wisdom, pain, growth and comedy cleverly 
compressed into the tale of a giddy young married couple whose happiness is 
momentarily spoiled by a deceitful intruder (James). 
</P>
<P>
How the husband Joe (Waters) sets about recovering his young wife Missy May 
(Charlaine Wood-ard), while rescuing their dignity and the marriage, is 
Solomon-like in its forbearance and in its generosity of spirit. This is a 
universal story, deliciously told. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the obvious quality of the acting at the Itchey Foot, Wolfe is to be 
commended for the liveliness of his direction. Clearly, he was able to infect 
his performers with his own exultation in this material. The stories are 
presented almost intact (with minor abbreviations here and there), but Hurston 
has created such living, broad-brush portraits that there is little to do in 
lifting them off the page but go with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
Some people may find Hurston's people bordering on caricature and, had they not 
been written by a savvy black woman, even perilously close to racist. There is 
arguably an Amos 'n' Andy quality to the bully, Sykes, or even those dandified 
blowhards in "Story in Harlem Slang." But Hurston was recording sounds and 
reporting on the human condition as she observed it, at a time when the truth 
was less concerned with stereotypes and more with archetypes. 
</P>
<P>
To have come through the mire of ethnic sensitivity and emerged on the other 
side -- as Wolfe demonstrably has -- with a healthy ability to laugh at one's 
ancestral strengths and foibles, is the sweetest maturity of all. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Itchey Foot Ristorante, 801 W. Temple St., Sundays at 6 p.m. until May 
28 (doors open at 4 p.m.). Tickets: $6 (213) 972-7273.

PHOEBE SNOW: BACK TO LIFE AT THE ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Isn't she dead?" asked a friend upon learning of the long-absent Phoebe Snow's 
return to town Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the perils of the comeback trail. 
</P>
<P>
The Snow show was not booked into Forest Lawn but rather the Roxy, a dead 
giveaway that the songstress is indeed still among the living. Not that it's 
been easy to tell during the last eight years. The recorded output of this 
unlikely but unforgettable star, who had her first and biggest hit 15 years ago 
with "Poetry Man," has been limited during most of the '80s to one vocal track 
on a Dave Grusin LP and anonymous advertising jingle work. 
</P>
<P>
Snow is back with a lovely new record, "Something Real," her first album since 
1981 and her first good one in a much longer while than that. At the Roxy, the 
sly, self-deprecating and surprisingly cocky singer seemed to feel obligated to 
explain just what tragedies or banalities have kept her out of the loop all 
those years. 
</P>
<P>
The only allusion to a serious illness she endured were repeated thanks to two 
doctors in the house. She did make touching reference to her 
"multiply-handicapped" 13-year-old daughter in introducing her version of "At 
Last," a bluesy number Etta James sang on the score of "Rain Man." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Snow dryly informed the sold-out crowd, "In the last eight years 
I've been doing a lot of laundry . . . sorting socks . . . baking bread . . . 
just hanging around the house and cutting cheese" -- a beat for a laugh -- "for 
hors d'oeuvres." 
</P>
<P>
Snow has not returned without an agenda -- largely aimed at letting the world 
know she has no designs on retaining the throne of "the Angst-ridden, aging 
hippie queen of folk guitar." To that end, once past the gentle opener, "Poetry 
Man," the 80-minute set took a much tougher turn, with her four-piece band 
providing punchy backing on tunes touching base with both funk (Sly Stone's 
"Thankful and Thoughtful") and rock (her own new "Cardiac Arrest"). 
</P>
<P>
Other misconceptions also bit the dust -- such as her celebrated "jazz-scat 
abilities." Alone with her acoustic guitar, Snow teased the audience with a bar 
of that ability before gravely intoning, "I'd rather be stark naked on Rodeo 
Drive during rush hour with a film crew, and then go home and watch it on the 
11 o'clock news, than scat-sing." Oh. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the woman doth protest too much about her desire to be less genteel and 
more of a rock 'n' roller; the set could have used more of the quiet moments 
that fill up much of her current album. But she left no doubt about her energy 
or ability, and she's hardly uncomfortable in a more upbeat, R&amp;B-centered 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when good popular singers (like Whitney Houston) feel compelled to 
hit every note on a scale, and weak ones (like Paula Abdul or Samantha Fox) 
scarcely seem to know what a scale is, Snow stands out much more than she did 
in her defining era. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't use (or overuse) her precious instrument in predictable ways; those 
inhuman-sounding high notes aren't necessarily used as glass-shattering 
balladic climaxes, but more often as midpoint transitions into more charged-up 
codas. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably unchanged for all intents and appearances, Snow also seems 
surprisingly undated -- and the bravado of this former "shy girl" who flexed 
her bicep at show's end was not undeserved. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the show alone on piano with prerecorded backing tracks was Grayson 
Hugh, who has a hit on adult contemporary radio with "Can't We Talk It Over in 
Bed," formerly a flop for Olivia Newton-John. 
</P>
<P>
A terminally middle-of-the-road singer trying hard to be hip, Hugh seemed to be 
attempting to play soulful, gritty music aimed at people who don't like 
soulful, gritty music -- in other words, a self-defeating kind of thing. His 
pointlessly histrionic version of "Bring It On Home to Me" was a truly 
irritating thing.

STRONG PRINCIPALS MASTER HURDLES OF 'ROMEO AND JULIET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In directing California Ballet for 21 years, Maxine Mahon has never suffered 
from an inferiority complex. 
</P>
<P>
Besides tackling highly daunting subjects ("Dracula") and scores ("The 
Miraculous Mandarin"), Mahon has matched her San Diego dancers against 
medal-winning Soviet virtuosi and even the filmic perfection of Fred Astaire 
and Ginger Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
So it's no surprise to find her attempting "Romeo and Juliet," although her 
company now can muster only eight male dancers -- none of them exactly a 
classical firebrand or danseur noble. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Without a home-grown Romeo at her disposal, Mahon recruited former 
Ballet West principal Mark Lanham to partner the Juliet of San Diego's own 
Denise Dabrowski. 
</P>
<P>
Lanham may not be the most boyish or passionate Romeo in ballet history, but on 
Saturday at the East County Performing Arts Center in El Cajon, his faultless 
professionalism freed Dabrowski to give a performance so right that it 
outweighed everything wrong in the choreography by associate director Charles 
Bennett and the dancing of her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Dark, willowy and recklessly emotional, this Juliet believed so strongly in her 
love for Romeo that her dancing in their duets had extraordinary daring. She 
would launch into what would become a lift or supported turn, trusting that he 
would be there, taking big chances with speed, force and especially balance. 
This is a secret the Soviets have perfected -- how to make classical dancing 
look spontaneous, from the heart -- and Dabrowski had clearly mastered its 
deepest expressive implications. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Nollett made a conventionally nasty, intriguingly feline Tybalt and 
David Crookes a lively, sympathetic Mercutio. 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1980, Bennett's condensed version eliminated Escalus, Rosaline, 
Benvolio, the marketplace harlots and much of the showpiece dancing to 
concentrate on the Capulet family tragedies. Often resourceful in dramatic 
passages, it suffered in lyrical sequences from a lack of flow: a tendency to 
stop for emblematic poses and then begin anew against the uninterrupted surge 
of Prokofiev's score (on tape). 
</P>
<P>
In the last third of the ballet, Bennett even staged scenes to the wrong music 
-- setting mime and dancing to the highly specific accompaniment composed for 
other moments -- and this alone undercut the credibility of the whole 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
As a curtain-raiser, California Ballet danced Mahon's "Holberg Suite" (to 
Grieg), a fluent, neoclassic vehicle for three couples that required more 
accomplished cavaliers than the company could provide. However, it did suggest 
the refinement that Karen Evans-Poolos, Sylvia Poolos and Debora Rumney have 
achieved and might fully reveal with partners of Lanham's caliber.

Ringo Starr will make his first U.S. concert tour this summer, with a Los 
Angelesappearance likely in August, sources have confirmed. Exact dates and 
sites are still being determined, but speculation is centering on the Universal 
Amphitheatre, the Greek Theatre, the Forum and the Sports Arena. The tour, for 
which the former Beatles drummer will be backed by guitarist Peter Frampton and 
former Cream bassist Jack Bruce, is reportedly being produced by David Fishof, 
who put together the Monkees reunion tours, the "Dirty Dancing" concert tour 
and several other oldies package shows. Fishof was unavailable for comment. 
Fellow ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, whose "Flowers in the Dirt" album is scheduled 
for June 6 release, is also considering a U.S. tour in the summer. Claudia Puig

A state appellate court in New Jersey, ruling in the divorce case of actor Joe 
Piscopo, says that the price of fame can be calculated and its value split 
between divorcing spouses. A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of 
Superior Court upheld a lower court's ruling that Piscopo's ex-wife is entitled 
to 48% of the comedian's "celebrity good will." The total value of that good 
will, determined by both sides in the case, who accepted the lower court 
judge's calculation, is $98,708.60. Monday's appellate ruling means that the 
former Nancy Piscopo stands to collect more than $47,000 for her part in 
advancing her comedian husband's career while they were married. Lawyers in the 
case said the ruling is the first appellate decision in the United States that 
celebrity good will is an asset subject to equitable distribution in the 
breakup of a marriage. Claudia Puig

While speaking of peaceful coexistence with NBC's new cable network, CNBC, the 
president of the rival Financial News Network nonetheless disputed Tuesday the 
number of subscribers that CNBC said it had when it began operations April 17. 
FNN chief David Meister told reporters in New York that after looking at the 
newcomer's work for several weeks, he feels that "CNBC is really not trying to 
compete with us." He also said FNN's research shows that CNBC is in only about 
5.3 million homes, not the 13 million homes it claims. NBC's response: "We 
stand by our (subscriber) figures and are confident they will grow." Claudia

Striking musicians ratified a proposed contract with Starlight Monday, which 
the theater's executive committee is expected to be approved at a 3 p.m. 
meeting today, management says. Seeking more job security, the musicians went 
on strike April 17. The agreement, which runs through Jan. 31, 1990, offers a 
4.5% pay raise to the players. It also calls for Starlight to employ 96 
musicians at some point during the season, although Starlight employs only 
about 20 musicians for each of its five musicals, said Joseph Pallazola, 
president of Local 325, American Federations of Musicians. The pact, which 
received less than unanimous approval by the musicians, was hammered out during 
two days of meetings last week.

RIVETING 'MEETING' ON 'AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"Malcolm." 
</P>
<P>
"Reverend." 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary dramatists are inevitably intrigued by the "what ifs" of history, 
ranging from a merging of Che Guevara and Evita Peron in "Evita" to a fictional 
conversation between Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that forms 
the basis for Jeff Stetson's play, "The Meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The "American Playhouse" production of the latter airs at 9 tonight on Channels 
28 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Although essentially a replay of civil rights rhetoric from the 1960s, "The 
Meeting" is a fascinating exercise in speculative theater, featuring stellar 
performances by Dick Anthony Williams as Malcolm X and Jason Bernard as King in 
a contained environment perfect for TV. 
</P>
<P>
This is that fine actor Williams' third turn as Malcolm X, the first coming in 
the miniseries "King," the second in the Off-Broadway production of "The 
Meeting." Effectively directed here by Bill Duke, he and Bernard tap the 
conflicts that separated and the common denominators that joined these civil 
rights leaders from clashing worlds. 
</P>
<P>
King, the Southern, small-town Baptist minister who answered racism with 
nonviolence, now looms as an epic figure in American annals. Malcolm X, the 
street-bred leader whose relative militancy terrified the white Establishment, 
is today a blurry footnote. 
</P>
<P>
Both were assassinated at age 39. Would they have ultimately united? Stetson 
apparently thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
"The Meeting" takes place on Valentine's Day, 1965, the day after Malcolm X's 
house has been bombed. The setting for the meeting, requested by Malcolm X, is 
a Harlem hotel room where a nervous Malcolm X awaits King with his scary, 
suspicious bodyguard Rashad (Paul Benjamin). 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights leaders begin by parrying. Malcolm X to King: "Still the 
dreamer." King to Malcolm X: "Still the revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
They arm wrestle. They word wrestle. They lecture. They shout. They implore. 
Malcolm X to King: "At least -- at least -- get angry!" King to Malcolm X: "You 
want to free blacks; I want to free Americans!" 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the meeting itself becomes a sort of liberating experience, 
with the acrimony between the two men ebbing and softening. They share 
laughter. They share dreams. They share mountaintops. They share a goal. And 
looming above all else, they will share a grim fate. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the fates of the children whom King and Malcolm X, in their 
different ways, sought to free from the cycle of poverty keeping them in 
economic bondage? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question you ask yourself while watching Karen Goodman's wonderful 
short film, "The Children's Storefront," which immediately follows "The 
Meeting" tonight. 
</P>
<P>
It's a brief but profound glimpse at a nonprofit, independent storefront school 
in Harlem for "the very, very poor urban black children" who have already been 
written off by the rest of society. Some were born to drug-addicted parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The Children's Storefront" is a sparsely narrated documentary that omits basic 
information about the school's financing, its process of selecting students and 
its record of achievement or failure in its 13 years existence. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, what Goodman does do is capture hope tempered by realism. You 
see inquisitive young children wanting to learn. You see intelligence. You see 
spirit. You see bright eyes. And you wonder if the brightness will remain. 
</P>
<P>
Is the school too little too late? "At what moment is the die cast?" asks the 
narrator. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, "The Children's Storefront" shows us how far we've 
come since the year of that fictional meeting between King and Malcolm X. And 
how much further we have to go.

TROUBLED BY SCANDAL; 
</P>
<P>
SOME IN JAPAN FEEL LOST ON MORAL MAP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kiyoshi Kishimoto was trained to sing folk ballads, the kind with morals 
attached, in which virtuous samurai are rewarded in old age for their earlier 
acts of benevolence. 
</P>
<P>
Words failed him, however, when he tried to write contemporary lyrics in the 
tradition of the Kawachi ballad, which is named for his native region near 
Osaka. Things were just not the way they were supposed to be. The golden rule 
was no longer in evidence. Everything had been turned around. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do bad these days, you're rewarded," Kishimoto lamented the other day. 
"If you cheat, you'll make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Pragmatic People 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are a pragmatic people. They are notorious tax evaders, and they 
have long been inured to seamy politics, dirty business and institutional 
corruption -- partly because they feel that nothing can be done about it, 
partly because just about everyone sees that the system can sometimes work to 
one's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But with the advent of the Recruit scandal, the sordid affair of insider 
trading and influence peddling that is unraveling Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita's administration, some Japanese are asking whether their moral 
compass might have gone haywire somewhere in the economic miracle of the past 
four decades. 
</P>
<P>
Kishimoto, for one, found his muse when he decided to write satirical songs, 
lampooning corrupt politicians and other shady characters in the news. 
</P>
<P>
He started a trilogy on the Recruit scandal with a ditty, "Arrest Ezoe," which 
ridicules Hiromasa Ezoe, founder of Recruit Co., an employment services and 
publishing concern. 
</P>
<P>
Ezoe is the man who doled out billions of yen in political "donations" and hot 
stock to grease the track for the expansion and diversification of his 
corporate group. Takeshita and his aides got about $1.5 million of the money in 
the form of donations, loans and stock profits. 
</P>
<P>
The sarcastic bard, who is known by his stage name, Kikusuimaru, delves into 
Ezoe's childhood and concludes, "He's the owner of a hungry soul." The lyrics 
are set to bouncy Japanese folk music, giving a decidedly absurd tone to what 
is by Japanese standards a scathing attack on malfeasance. 
</P>
<P>
Another song goes: "These bigwigs make piles of money, using their state 
authority. . . . In one second, they can collect as much cash as it takes a 
wage-earner a year to make." 
</P>
<P>
Kikusuimaru may not be a Japanese Bob Dylan in terms of lyricism, but he has a 
similar message: that the times are changing. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, political satire attracts scant notice in Japan, where popular humor 
tends toward slapstick rather than subtle irony. But Kishimoto has become a 
minor celebrity of sorts, touching a national nerve with his songs about the 
Recruit scandal, and there is a two-week waiting list for his cassette 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to know for sure whether the public outrage over Recruit will 
mark a watershed in the way people examine ethical standards, or whether the 
noise will simply die down and fit into an established pattern of ritual 
atonement and renewed malaise. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a fair number of Japanese have reacted to the disclosures of corruption 
with a fatalistic sigh, a cynical yawn or a shikata ga nai -- "it can't be 
helped." 
</P>
<P>
Still, when Takeshita took responsibility for his fund-raising irregularities 
and announced last week that he would soon resign, a whiff of fundamental 
change was in the air. At the very least, it is a time to pause for some 
serious public hand-wringing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our politicians are a disgrace," said Kei Aiko, 59, an office worker 
interviewed in Tokyo's Otemachi financial district. "But after all, the blame 
lies in Japanese society. We created them." 
</P>
<P>
Takashi Ishihara, chairman of Keizai Doyukai, the Japan Assn. of Corporate 
Executives, suggested in a speech that perhaps too much emphasis has been 
placed on sales and profits in the past and that the "egocentric way of 
management" has caused problems with overheated competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business 'Breeding Ground' 
</P>
<P>
"I think we cannot deny that the business community more or less provided the 
breeding ground for (the Recruit) scandal," said Ishihara, who is also chairman 
of Nissan Motor Co. His call for Takeshita's resignation was believed to have 
been instrumental in the prime minister's capitulation after months of stubborn 
resistance to the growing furor. 
</P>
<P>
The Recruit excitement comes at a time when new affluence has given the 
Japanese more time to step off the economic treadmill and ponder the concepts 
of wrong and right, unfair and fair, dirty and clean. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the population has gotten so angry about a scandal," 
said Seijiro Watanabe, a lawyer and former prosecutor who has for many years 
waged a lonely campaign against rampant fraud in Japan's securities markets. "I 
always thought Japanese had a poorly developed concept of fairness, but in the 
Recruit affair people have been reacting the way Americans might." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say the Japanese are becoming more like Americans, or even that 
they should. In fact, that is a prospect many reasonable people here would 
abhor, viewing the abject poverty, violent crime any many social injustices in 
the United States and other advanced Western industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's low crime and relatively equitable income distribution is predicated on 
an ethos of social harmony that undeniably has a high degree of moral 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
The frame is different, though. Rather than adhering to absolute concepts of 
morality, to which Judeo-Christian cultures subscribe, Japanese society moves 
on the rails of something anthropologists call "situational ethics." The golden 
rule here concerns itself with particular results, not an abstract and 
immutable concept of law. A crime occurs when there is a victim, and the 
perpetrator is caught, not when an immoral act is committed. 
</P>
<P>
That is why a Japanese can spend time in jail for causing a fatal traffic 
accident but receive a suspended sentence for rigging prices in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese have been slow to embrace the idea that securities fraud is wrong, 
critics say, because the postwar boom in the stock market has enriched even 
small investors to the point where it is not clear who has been victimized by 
collusion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Betrayed Sense of Fairness 
</P>
<P>
Righteous indignation over shady stock dealings in the Recruit scandal had 
perhaps more to do with a betrayed sense of situational fairness than with 
alleged moral turpitude among the more than 150 politicians, bureaucrats and 
businessmen who had the privilege of buying Ezoe's hot stock at artificially 
low prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Recruit insiders were revealed to have made huge, tax-free profits at a 
time when the general populace was recoiling from the ruling party's unilateral 
imposition of an unpopular 3% consumption tax. 
</P>
<P>
The real rub was that the opportunity gap between the haves and have-nots 
seemed grossly unfair, not that the stock transactions might have constituted 
bribes or that members of Parliament were up to the same old dirty tricks in 
raising political funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't really surprised about the scandal," said Yutaka Sakamoto, who owns 
a small toy store in the Tokyo residential district of Ebisu. "The feeling was, 
'Oh, they're doing it again.' But still, it didn't seem right that these people 
should be allowed to make a killing when we have to work for our living." 
</P>
<P>
The same value of situational fairness accounts for why the Japanese are 
world-class tax scofflaws. More than 90% of self-employed taxpayers are caught 
hiding income; in a government audit of 2,206 large companies last year, all 
but one cheated on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese have a completely different sensibility (than Westerners) about 
upholding the law and paying tax," said Toshio Ogawa, another former 
prosecutor-turned-lawyer. "Historically, authority has never been vested in the 
people; it's all been promulgated from above. So there's no shame in breaking 
the law, especially when it comes to hiding income from the tax authorities." 
</P>
<P>
Tax matters aside, the average Japanese is generally subservient to officialdom 
and not inclined toward petty graft. Few individuals would dream of attempting 
to bribe a traffic cop or pay off a building inspector. Japanese also maintain 
an uncanny pact of mutual trust, and this country is a good place to lose a 
wallet, because it will probably be returned. Last month, hikers found two bags 
of cash in a bamboo grove in Kawasaki -- totaling some $1.4 million -- and 
immediately turned them in to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giving Lavish Gifts 
</P>
<P>
But it sometimes seems that personal bribes have a place in Japanese society. 
Most people are accustomed to lavishing gifts on social benefactors, and at 
times this has overtones of buying influence. 
</P>
<P>
A gift cannot be too generous when important decisions are being made, such as 
a child's entrance into a private school. Scandals periodically emerge where 
eager parents get caught bribing administrators at medical or dental colleges 
with piles of cash. 
</P>
<P>
It is at the corporate level, however, where a pattern of bribery emerges 
clearly. As in most Asian societies, and in some Western ones too, kickbacks 
are the norm. The corruption spreads to the political world when it comes to 
the pork barrel -- police say about half of all bribery arrests involve payoffs 
between construction companies and politicians, mostly provincial, who have 
influence over how public works contracts will be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
There are some signs that the prevailing social mood is generating more 
sympathy for formal law and order. 
</P>
<P>
In this spring's batch of graduates of the Legal Training and Research 
Institute, which is Japan's single passageway to the legal profession, the 
number choosing to become prosecutors instead of judges or lawyers increased by 
25% over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14 Arrested So Far 
</P>
<P>
That happens during most major political scandals, when sudden glory is 
bestowed upon the Public Prosecutor's Office. Special prosecutors have arrested 
14 people in the Recruit scandal so far, including one of Japan's most 
venerable businessmen, two former elite bureaucrats and Ezoe. Prosecution of 
politicians has not progressed beyond the rumor stage. 
</P>
<P>
Suicide is yet another element in what the Wall Street Journal's Stephen 
Kreider Yoder dubbed the "Kabuki drama" of the Recruit scandal. Ihei Aoki, 
Takeshita's trusted aide, took his own life, presumably to shield his boss. 
Aoki handled Takeshita's finances and dealt in the unlisted stock issue of the 
Recruit subsidiary that was at the core of the case. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen other political aides have committed suicide as the result of 
postwar scandals. Suicide is considered a virtuous act for a loyal retainer who 
has potentially incriminating evidence against his lord -- and an appropriately 
logical thing in terms of situational ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Where the morality play will go from here is anybody's guess. The indictment of 
money politics stops short of serious debate on how to draw the line between 
graft and good will in the context of a pervasive system of gift-giving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wedding Gifts Expected 
</P>
<P>
In their defense, members of Parliament complain that they must raise large 
sums of money to meet their constituents' expectations that, when they attend 
weddings and funerals, the politicians will invariably arrive with envelopes of 
cash in hand. 
</P>
<P>
And constituents are all too willing to oblige politicians needing campaign 
donations, because they know this is how they will get bridges built, licenses 
granted and regulations changed. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are to blame too," said Kikusuimaru the singer. "But not many of us 
understand that. It's a lot easier to just dump the blame on the Liberal 
Democrats."

6 S. KOREA RIOT POLICE KILLED IN RESCUE RAID

<P>
Six South Korean police officers were killed early today when protesting 
students set fire to a campus building as riot police stormed it to free 
captured colleagues, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from the scene at Dongui University in Pusan, the major port about 200 
miles southeast of Seoul, said the death toll could rise. The police spokesman 
said 15 officers and at least one student were in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said most of the victims died from smoke inhalation. Some 
of the injured suffered burns or hurt themselves leaping from the nine-story 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The drama began when radical students captured five plainclothes officers 
Tuesday evening during an off-campus demonstration called to protest the action 
of police in firing more than 20 warning shots the previous night to beat back 
a radical student attack on a police post. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials negotiated unsuccessfully through the night for the hostages' 
release, and authorities then ordered a raid. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 police launched the campus assault shortly before dawn today to free 
their colleagues, who were being held blindfolded on the seventh floor of the 
library building. 
</P>
<P>
As they rushed up the stairs, students splashed gasoline over barricades they 
had set up earlier to block doorways and fled to the roof with the hostages. 
When police reached the seventh floor, students set the barricades alight with 
gasoline bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic Yonhap News Agency said that several officers, after suffering 
burns, dropped to their deaths after hanging briefly from a window ledge. Other 
reports said the victims leaped from the windows. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 88 students were arrested at the school, a police spokesman said. 
The university administration immediately canceled classes and barred students 
from entering the campus. All of the hostages were later freed when professors 
intervened and persuaded the students to let them go, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was by far the deadliest incident in recent years in a country that has 
become used to almost daily violence on campuses and in strike-bound factories. 
National police headquarters in Seoul said it was the worst loss of police life 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recent weeks by 
radical students and dissidents demanding the overthrow of President Roh Tae 
Woo's government. But protests rarely result in deaths in South Korea despite 
the fury of street clashes in which protesters battle riot police with 
firebombs and rocks. Riot police are normally armed only with tear gas and 
batons. 
</P>
<P>
Today's heavy toll on a police force already stretched nearly to the breaking 
point by continuous riot duty seemed certain to strengthen the hand of 
rightists in President Roh's administration who have been calling for all-out 
war on leftists.

<P>
The United States and West Germany are moving painfully toward a solution to 
their dispute over short-range nuclear missiles and may patch up the rift in 
time for the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to celebrate 
their regained unity at a summit meeting this month, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials said that they have proposed several solutions to 
the quarrel within the alliance, which some U.S. and European diplomats have 
called the most serious dispute in the 40 years of NATO history. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also signaled new flexibility on Tuesday, 
saying that he is "very optimistic" a compromise can be reached by the time 
President Bush travels to Europe in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to make a contribution to that compromise and see good chances of 
one," Kohl told reporters during a visit to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Agreement on Terms 
</P>
<P>
But American and German officials said that, while both governments want to end 
their embarrassing dispute in time for the summit, no agreement has been 
reached on the terms of the reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, they said, the Bush Administration is still resisting West 
Germany's call for negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce the number of 
short-range missiles -- although some officials said they believe a compromise 
on that point will be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
And the acid tone of some officials' comments made it clear that between the 
West's two most powerful allies, feelings are still bruised. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't need this problem right now," a senior U.S. official 
complained of the Germans' actions. "It has put these issues under a microscope 
at a time when we wanted to be talking about the unity of the West." 
</P>
<P>
Further, the Reagan Administration's top arms control adviser said Tuesday that 
Bush was making a grave mistake in refusing to open talks with the Soviet Union 
on the short-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Paul H. Nitze, in an interview with the New York Times after he left office 
Monday, indicated that he sharply disagreed with the current Administration on 
the divisive issue. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran negotiator said that he believes negotiations on reducing the 
weapons would be in the military interest of the West because such talks would 
provide an opportunity to eliminate a large Soviet advantage. He also said the 
Bush approach is "politically impossible for much of Europe," according to the 
New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government has broken with the United States on two issues dealing 
with NATO's short-range nuclear missiles -- those with a range below 300 miles, 
most of which are based in West Germany. Kohl wants the alliance to delay any 
decision on whether to build a more modern missile until after his country's 
next election in 1990, and, last month, he reversed his own position and called 
for early negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce the number of missiles 
on both sides of Europe's East-West divide. 
</P>
<P>
The West German public is strongly in favor of eliminating all short-range 
nuclear missiles, in part because most would explode on German soil if they 
were ever used. But NATO military planners believe that the missiles are 
essential to counter the Soviet Bloc's advantage in conventional military 
forces in Europe and say that the current missiles are quickly becoming 
obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6 Countries Support Bonn 
</P>
<P>
The issue has divided the alliance into two sometimes-contentious camps, with 
six countries including Italy and Norway supporting the German stand while 
Britain and the Netherlands have backed the United States. Others, including 
France, have taken no clear position. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and West German officials said that at least four possible solutions have 
been discussed in quiet consultations among the 16 NATO governments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An announcement that the United States would unilaterally reduce NATO's 88 
aging Lance short-range missile launchers while it is installing a smaller 
number of more modern missiles, coupled with a challenge to the Soviet Union to 
reduce its estimated 1,400 short-range launchers to the same level. The Bush 
Administration suggested this approach last week in talks with the visiting 
West German foreign and defense ministers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A call for negotiations with the Soviet Union on short-range missiles, as 
soon as substantial progress is made in the current Vienna talks to reduce 
conventional armed forces in Europe. This was proposed by the Kohl government, 
but the Administration is resisting the idea. U.S. officials say they fear 
that, once such talks begin, the pressure for eliminating all short-range 
nuclear missiles will prove irresistible -- and give the Soviet Union military 
superiority on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreement by West Germany to develop an accurate and powerful non-nuclear 
missile that eventually could replace the short-range nuclear force. Some 
Administration officials have proposed this as part of a solution, but a West 
German official said that the Kohl government does not favor the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The appointment of a special NATO committee to study the issue further -- 
essentially, an agreement simply to ignore the problem for the short run and to 
allow the alliance's leaders to meet in Brussels on schedule May 29 and 30. But 
officials on both sides admit that this would be an admission of failure to 
solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greatest Sticking Point 
</P>
<P>
The greatest sticking point remains the German government's desire for some 
kind of NATO endorsement of early negotiations over short-range missiles, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a mandate for these talks," a West German official said. "The question 
is, how do we condition the mandate? We could say that we want these talks, but 
with all deliberate speed, as the American phrase goes" -- a reference to the 
1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ordered school desegregation but failed 
to order a specific timetable. He added: "We could take into account the 
progress of the talks in Vienna," the negotiations on conventional armed forces 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Bush Administration officials have said that they could agree to 
negotiations on short-range missiles -- but only after ending the East-West 
imbalance in conventional armed forces, which the missiles are intended to 
counterbalance. The Vienna talks are aimed at that issue, but negotiators there 
do not expect to reach an agreement for several years. 
</P>
<P>
So sensitive has this point become that State Department spokesman Margaret 
Tutwiler and other U.S. officials refused to repeat their own previous position 
-- because, said one, "we don't want to entertain the idea of negotiations at 
all" in the face of the Germans' demands. 
</P>
<P>
In public, the Administration has been unyielding, reflecting continuing 
annoyance at the Germans' highly public dissent from U.S. policy -- a dissent 
that some U.S. officials charged was intended for Kohl's internal political 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Our Views Have Not Changed' 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize that our views have not changed," Tutwiler said. She 
said that the Administration is seeking "a solution acceptable to all allies" 
-- but not a "compromise," that could imply a softening of the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials, on the other hand, spent much of the day stressing their 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a position but it's our starting position for negotiations within the 
alliance," said one. "We are not like Martin Luther, saying 'Here I stand, I 
cannot otherwise.' " 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official took some satisfaction at that and suggested that the Germans 
might be ready to back down in the face of the Administration's resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball's in their court," the official said. "They look like they're tearing 
up the alliance, and I don't think they want that on their heads."

TIMBER GROUP SEEKS SOFTER LOGGING RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK A. STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A timber industry group Tuesday proposed several new regulations that would 
make it easier for loggers to fell trees and harder for conservationists to 
challenge controversial logging practices. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals, which the Timber Assn. of California said would simply make 
clear what is and is not required by the state to approve timber harvesting, 
were introduced before the state Board of Forestry in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member board is authorized under state law to adopt the specific 
logging regulations needed to implement general guidelines outlined in the 
state Forest Practice Act. The board, which critics say is sympathetic to the 
logging industry, Tuesday acknowledged the industry suggestions but did not say 
when it would decide what to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists were swift to criticize the industry's proposals, arguing the 
recommended rules would kill the last remnants of environmental protection left 
in the state's logging laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Timber harvest plans as they read now are virtually worthless," said one 
Sierra Club lawyer, Joseph J. Brecher of Oakland. "They give (regulators) so 
much discretion . . . almost any kind of horrible logging practice is 
approved." 
</P>
<P>
"There are, however, a few rules that we were able to use to stop some of the 
worst plans, especially where old-growth was concerned," he added. "The 
industry has been collecting all of those decisions in our favor, and now they 
want to do away with the (regulatory) provisions we used." 
</P>
<P>
The timber association said in introducing its proposals that it simply sought 
to clean up "some vagueness in the forest practice rules" and "some confusion 
and capriciousness in legal interpretations of them." 
</P>
<P>
The industry group denied that a string of legal setbacks suffered recently by 
its members were the result of loggers breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the adverse court decisions are based primarily on the failure to 
respond adequately to significant environmental points raised during the THP 
(timber harvest plan) review process," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the timber association acknowledged that changes in forest 
practice rules are needed to offset the string of legal victories by 
environmentalists, who have blocked a significant amount of logging that could 
threaten the rare spotted owl or sensitive fish-spawning streams. 
</P>
<P>
As discussed in its 48-page report to the board, the timber association 
proposals would: 
</P>
<P>
* Officially elevate logging to be "paramount among all competing uses" in 
timber-production zones, and forbid regulatory agencies to presume that logging 
has "significant adverse impact on the environment." 
</P>
<P>
* Automatically reject any effort to mitigate environmental damage caused by 
logging if the environmental protection measures would "significantly detract 
from growing and harvesting timber." 
</P>
<P>
* Redefine the analysis of cumulative logging impacts to exclude areas which 
will be logged more than five years in the future and timber operations planned 
by other companies. Studies of cumulative impacts would be "guided" by 
undefined standards of "practicality and reasonableness." 
</P>
<P>
* Restrict requests for additional information beyond what is submitted by a 
timber company in its original timber-harvest plan. Information requests would 
have to be made through the state Department of Forestry and would be answered 
only if found to be reasonable and not too costly to answer. The timber harvest 
plan could be approved before the additional information is provided. 
</P>
<P>
* Modify protection of threatened and endangered species by limiting logging 
restrictions only to those habitats where endangered species are known to live 
now, not to habitats that might be suitable for such species in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The new rules will still sound like they have protection," said Brecher, "but 
because of the wiggly language they contain -- and because the Department of 
Forestry is solidly behind this industry -- they can and will be interpreted to 
support any kind of logging." 
</P>
<P>
Brecher added that industry proposals were so radical that environmentalists 
could revive the controversial notion of requiring lengthy, costly 
environmental impact reports for timber harvests. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement hammered out in the 1970s found California's timber laws to be 
"functionally equivalent" to the tough California Environmental Quality Act. 
Since then, timber harvests have been exempt from the law's more arduous 
analysis requirements.

SAN JOSE TOPS S.F. AS STATE'S 3RD BIGGEST CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Jose, a small farm town down the road not too many years ago, has passed 
San Francisco in population to become California's third most populous city, 
the state reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Finance on Tuesday put the population of San Jose at 
738,400, ahead of San Francisco, at 731,700, for the first time ever. In the 
last year, San Jose has added 10,100 people, while its now-smaller city to the 
north lost 4,800 residents. 
</P>
<P>
For San Jose, it has been a rapid climb up to the list of major cities. In 
1950, while San Francisco had long been the major West Coast port and financial 
center, San Jose had a mere 95,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
In the post-World War II era, San Jose has been one of the fastest-growing 
cities in the country. At the same time, San Francisco's numbers have slipped 
and it has also lost much of its preeminence on the West Coast to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figures Are Estimates 
</P>
<P>
The population figures are estimates, calculated by the state to help divide up 
tax revenues and fill the 10-year gap between the national census conducted by 
the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco was still almost 50,000 ahead of San Jose when the government 
last counted officially, in 1980. And it is conceivable that next year's 
federal census will return San Francisco to third place. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials intend to make a stronger effort to count illegal immigrants, 
the homeless and minority group members who tend to be under-counted in the 
state survey. San Francisco, with a more diverse population than San Jose, 
stands to gain from a more accurate tally of the population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Grows by 2.4% 
</P>
<P>
The report Tuesday also showed that California grew by 2.4% -- 666,000 people 
-- last year to increase its lead as the country's most populous state. About 
28,662,000 people -- about 11% of the U.S. population -- live in California. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles tops all cities in California, with an estimated 3,400,500. San 
Diego is second with about 1,086,000. After San Jose and San Francisco, the 
state ranks in order Long Beach, Oakland, Sacramento, Fresno, Anaheim and Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The fastest-growing large cities were Corona, in Riverside County, which added 
16.8% to its population, and Fontana in San Bernardino County, which grew by 
11.6%. The fastest-growing city in Los Angeles County was Palmdale, at 17.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Among cities under 50,000 population, the most rapid growth was counted in 
Corcoran, in Kings County. Primarily because of a new state prison, whose 
inmates count as residents, Corcoran grew 43% to 11,000 people.

BROWN ASSAILS DEUKMEJIAN'S ASSAULT GUN FINES PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown on Tuesday declared his opposition to a proposal 
by Gov. George Deukmejian that current owners of assault guns who do not 
register their weapons should merely be fined instead of charged with a 
criminal offense. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like a parking ticket," said Brown (D-San Francisco), asserting that 
"some of us (Democrats) will not vote to make the possession of an assault 
rifle an infraction." 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Brown's opposition would be enough to torpedo the 
assault-gun ban, which has been strongly promoted by law enforcement leaders, 
teachers and neighborhood activists fed up with street gang terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian's chief of staff, Michael R. Frost, who is helping craft an 
expected compromise version of legislation to ban most semiautomatic weapons, 
suggested that Brown might not be up to date on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Frost told a reporter, "There is going to be a fairly stiff fine associated 
(with failure to register). I would expect (the Speaker) would support the 
final version of the bill." 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman for Brown later reiterated his determination to oppose 
any bill "that makes it an infraction to (illegally) possess . . . any assault 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
As currently written, bills by Assemblyman Mike Roos and Senate President Pro 
Tem David A. Roberti, both Los Angeles Democrats, would make it either a felony 
or misdemeanor for current owners of assault guns to fail to register them with 
the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
The governor maintains that the criminal penalties would be too tough on 
otherwise law-abiding gun owners who refuse or neglect to register their 
weapons. He has insisted that the penalty for failing to register an assault 
weapon be an infraction, punishable with a fine much like a traffic citation. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the pending legislation would require owners of assault 
weapons who want to keep them to register the firearms by Jan. 1, 1991. To 
qualify, the guns would have to be acquired lawfully by this June 1. 
</P>
<P>
The bills would make illegal the possession of about 60 military-style assault 
rifles, pistols and shotguns. Punishment could range from a $1,000 fine and one 
year in the jail to a term in state prison of up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Each measure has passed both houses in different forms and is awaiting final 
action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Time 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian announced his opposition to criminal penalties for failing to 
register the weapons shortly after he asked Roberti on April 19 to hold up 
expected final passage of his bill. The governor said he needed more time to 
study the measure and offer amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Roos, Roberti and Deukmejian have met privately once to discuss 
their differences. Their staffs, however, have conducted a series of 
negotiating sessions in an effort to reach a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now in the area of dealing with technical aspects of the bill," Frost 
said Tuesday after a negotiating session. "I don't think there are substantive 
major policy differences at this point. It is really in the fine-tuning area." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown, who has mostly played a cameo role in the Legislature's effort to 
ban assault guns, told a press conference that he opposes the infraction 
penalty as "watering down the bill." 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker did not, however, indicate that his opposition to the infraction 
penalty would be enough to kill the proposal. He did voice concern that 
negotiations tend to "reduce the urgency and courage quotient" in many 
legislators who have supported the measure. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brown's press secretary, Susan Jetton, the Speaker believes that 
while some Democrats would not vote for the bill with the infraction provision, 
Republicans who previously opposed it would vote for it because it would bear 
the governor's clear-cut endorsement.

HUTTENBACK STILL COLLECTING PAY AT SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten months after being convicted of embezzling about $250,000 in campus funds 
to renovate his private home, former UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Robert 
Huttenback is still being paid about $6,800 a month by the university. 
</P>
<P>
Huttenback was suspended indefinitely last September from his post as a tenured 
professor in the history department, and a campus discipline review process was 
initiated to determine his future. Almost an entire school year later, no 
decision has been made, and Huttenback continues to draw his salary. 
</P>
<P>
Many professors and students have expressed outrage that the university 
Huttenback embezzled funds from should continue to pay his salary. And, they 
say, during a period of budget cutbacks on campus, Huttenback's $81,700-a-year 
salary is sorely needed for other campus programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This year there are 2,400 freshmen who are unable to take required freshman 
English courses because the university is too short of money to provide those 
courses," said John Reiff, who teaches freshman composition. "So it's terribly 
puzzling and distressing to pay a convicted felon for not teaching." 
</P>
<P>
After Huttenback was suspended, a faculty committee, following campus 
regulations, began reviewing his case in order to make a recommendation to 
Chancellor Barbara Uehling. 
</P>
<P>
Huttenback's suspension at full pay "was not an arbitrary matter," said John 
Myers, chairman of the five-member Committee of Privilege and Tenure. All 
suspended professors, according to the faculty code of conduct, he said, must 
be given full pay while their future is determined. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has not yet made a recommendation to the chancellor, he said, 
because "this is a very complicated matter that has to be done with a great 
deal of thought. A person's reputation and livelihood are at stake. Something 
like this has to be done carefully with due regard to all parties." 
</P>
<P>
But other faculty members said a decision should have been made long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to defend this kind of foot-dragging. . . ," said Thomas 
Harding, a professor of anthropology. "The university should at least hold his 
salary in escrow until this whole thing's resolved. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I have a friend who's a member of a tennis club in town, and whenever he sees 
Huttenback playing tennis he's furious. Huttenback's getting paid and all he's 
doing is playing tennis." 
</P>
<P>
A number of faculty members and students say the university has a 
responsibility to resolve the matter quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the kind of example the university should be setting for young 
people," said Gerald Horne, chairman of the black studies department. "Students 
read about Watergate and the Teapot Dome scandal in their classes. So when they 
see $81,000 handed out to a person involved in another scandal, it sends the 
wrong message to them. This kind of thing breeds cynicism." 
</P>
<P>
Huttenback resigned as chancellor in July, 1986, after controversy erupted over 
his expenditures on his home, but he continued to teach history at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
He was later convicted of embezzlement and income tax evasion in connection 
with the funds spent on his home, but was spared a prison sentence. He was 
ordered to pay a $60,000 fine, serve five years' probation and perform 1,000 
hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Huttenback, who is appealing his conviction, still faces several levels of 
review before his future at the university is determined. Even if the faculty 
committee decides that Huttenback should be demoted or dismissed and Chancellor 
Uehling accepts the committee's recommendation, the University of California 
regents must make the final decision on Huttenback's teaching future. 
</P>
<P>
Javier LaFianza, president of the UC Santa Barbara student body, said students 
are incensed that Huttenback's future at the university has taken so long to 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"The faculty has been talking about this for eight months and they're no closer 
to a decision than when they started," LaFianza said. "It's disgraceful that we 
continue to pay a man who has been convicted of stealing from us."

The Chinese government this morning rejected an ultimatum from pro-democracy 
student activists who are threatening another protest march for Thursday if not 
granted a formal dialogue between their association and top leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Class boycotts by tens of thousands of university students continued in Beijing 
today, while about 8,000 Chinese students staged a pro-democracy protest march 
in Shanghai on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Give Us Democracy and Freedom," "Down With Bureaucratic Profiteering" and 
"Media Must Tell the Truth," proclaimed banners carried by the demonstrators in 
Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, a group of about 60 student protest leaders from more than 30 
schools delivered copies of a petition to state and Communist Party offices 
Tuesday afternoon seeking legal recognition for their unofficial student 
association and the opening of a formal dialogue between at least one top 
government leader and the association. 
</P>
<P>
They threatened that if they did not receive an answer by noon today, they 
would "reserve the right" to stage another protest demonstration Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday is the 70th anniversary of student protests in 1919 that launched a 
campaign for science and democracy called the May 4th Movement. The current 
pro-democracy campaign has consciously modeled itself as a successor to that 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
State Council spokesman Yuan Mu, at a press conference this morning, rejected 
the students' demands. He charged that the students are being incited by "a 
handful of people engaged in political struggle and negating the leadership of 
the Communist Party and the socialist system." 
</P>
<P>
Yuan said the government is willing to engage in dialogue with students through 
official student associations, as it has already begun doing, but will not 
recognize the ad hoc association that has organized the protests. He urged 
students to return to classes and forgo protests, but also implied that the 
government does not intend to use force against demonstrations Thursday if they 
do occur. 
</P>
<P>
The government mobilized thousands of police and soldiers in an attempt to 
intimidate protesters last Thursday. But about 50,000 students marched in 
defiance of government warnings, accompanied by tens of thousands of Beijing 
residents, while hundreds of thousands of supportive spectators saw them on 
their route. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the government has adopted a conciliatory but firm attitude, 
seeking to separate the mass of students from their most radical leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not like to see any more demonstrations that are harmful to social 
stability," Yuan said this morning. "If such demonstrations do take place, we 
will continue to abide by the correct attitudes and practices we have adopted 
the past few days." 
</P>
<P>
Yuan implied that there may be arrests, but not immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people . . . who have engaged in behind-the-scenes activities 
who are very vicious, and at present they are also involved in the current 
events," Yuan said. "But at present we are not planning to take action against 
them because now the good and the bad are mixed together, so the circumstances 
are not favorable for direct action such as detentions or arrests. If we do 
that, it would be too stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Among the demands of the students in Shanghai is reinstatement of Qin Benli, 
former editor of the World Economic Herald, a weekly newspaper that under his 
guidance was one of the most liberal and most informative publications in 
China. Qin was fired last week, at the orders of Shanghai Communist Party 
officials, for trying to publish material deemed too supportive of protesting 
students. 
</P>
<P>
In another conciliatory effort to cool protests, Hu Qili, a member of the 
Politburo Standing Committee, issued a call Tuesday for the gradual growth of 
political democracy simultaneously with economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Hu said that "one should not precede the other," according to a New China News 
Agency report on his comments, which were made in a meeting with a visiting 
Bulgarian delegation. "The most important work for China to do at present is to 
maintain political stability. Of course, stability doesn't mean that people 
cannot voice their opinions." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leadership is believed to be especially sensitive about the 
possible demonstrations Thursday, in particular because the Communist Party has 
long honored the May 4th Movement and finds it humiliating to have the 
progressive nature of that struggle turned against it.

POPE DECRIES APARTHEID IN ZAMBIA VISIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Landing in one of the capitals of anti-South Africa activity, Pope John Paul II 
on Tuesday delivered a strong anti-apartheid message, praising Zambia for its 
"commitment to protect and promote each individual's rights." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Pope acknowledged that poverty, which has struck as hard 
here as anywhere in Africa, threatens the strength of the church itself. And he 
also put in a strong word for inculcation by the church of the "obligations of 
marriage and family life" -- this in a land where sexually transmitted AIDS may 
have infected as much as 20% of the urban population. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's arrival from the French island of Reunion on an Air France 
supersonic Concorde -- the first time a pontiff's plane has broken the sound 
barrier and the first time the luxurious jet has landed in this country -- may 
have suggested some unintended ironies. 
</P>
<P>
For the standard of living may have fallen faster here since independence in 
1964 than in any sub-Saharan African country not afflicted by war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staple Food Shortages 
</P>
<P>
Shortages of such staples as maize, wheat and sugar are nearly constant. To 
keep their employees from spending most of their work days in line waiting to 
buy food, many foreign businesses and embassies buy staples in bulk and resell 
them to workers. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the lines have turned ugly; on several occasions police have 
fired tear gas at wait-weary shoppers who were on the point of storming empty 
government shops. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties have focused more attention on the economic policies of 
Kenneth D. Kaunda, who has led Zambia since independence, creating a nation of 
remarkable political stability and equality but of economic decline. Kaunda has 
failed to develop Zambia's potentially rich agricultural land, allowing the 
nation to become dependent on copper mining for 90% of its foreign income. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, to the extent they touched at all on economic matters, the Pope's 
homilies on his first day in Zambia focused more on the exterior causes of 
poverty in this area. 
</P>
<P>
These include regional instability fomented by South Africa and perennially low 
prices for African agricultural exports. 
</P>
<P>
"I am aware that events in this region in recent years, and world events beyond 
your control which affect all developing countries, have brought economic and 
social difficulties in their wake," he said upon landing at Lusaka airport to a 
joyous welcome from a crowd of tens of thousands, tribal dancers, choirs and a 
military honor guard. 
</P>
<P>
Both the pontiff and Kaunda acknowledged Lusaka's status as headquarters of the 
African National Congress with firm denunciations of South Africa's racial 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"We face the affliction of apartheid, an all-round human degradation declared 
by the international community as a sin against humanity itself," Kaunda said 
in his welcoming speech. 
</P>
<P>
While on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion earlier Tuesday, the Pope beatified 
a 19th-Century French missionary considered the apostle of the island's slaves, 
the Associated Press reported. The beatification represented a first step 
towards possible sainthood for Jean-Bernard Rousseau, known as Brother 
Scubilion, who died in 1867. Rousseau spent 34 years on the island, teaching 
catechism to the African slaves taken to the island by the French colonists.

HUNGARY TEARS DOWN SECTION OF 'IRON CURTAIN'

<TEXT>
<P>
Frontier guards on Tuesday began dismantling part of Hungary's portion of the 
symbolic "Iron Curtain" that has divided Europe for four decades as they 
started to remove the electrified barbed wire fence along the border with 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The removal began outside the border village of Hegyeshalom, 85 miles northwest 
of Budapest, and at Sopron and Szombathely farther south, the three busiest 
crossing points into Austria. 
</P>
<P>
"The political conditions are ripe," Col. Balazs Novaki, deputy chief of staff 
of the National Command of frontier guards, told a news conference. 
"Restructuring in Hungary and the process of democratization does not make it 
necessary to maintain it." 
</P>
<P>
Novaki said that Hungary, once a partner in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, has 
"traditionally good relations with Austria," and the presence of the menacing 
watch towers and barbed wire fences has disturbed local inhabitants since they 
were erected in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
The move is also likely to improve Hungary's image. 
</P>
<P>
About 160 miles of the eight-foot-high fence along Hungary's western border 
with Austria will be removed by Dec. 31, 1990. The border is actually 225 miles 
long, but roads, rivers and rail tracks take up about 75 miles where no fence 
has been raised. 
</P>
<P>
Watchtowers and other control facilities will also be removed in the project 
estimated to cost $700,000 to $800,000. But periodic border patrols will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Hegyeshalom, Zoltan Vincze, said residents are "pleased to see the 
fence going because its removal restores the unity of the landscape." 
</P>
<P>
The barbed-wire fence runs between one and 1 1/2 miles east of the geographical 
border along the Danube plain. It was built in 1949 after the Communist 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Hungary consulted neither Austria nor its Warsaw Pact allies 
about its decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Nor did we consult our Western neighbor when we decided to erect the fence," 
Novaki noted. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, Foreign Ministry spokesman Walter Greinert said Austria regarded the 
dismantling of the fence a "very positive sign." 
</P>
<P>
But Austrian government sources fear that other East Europeans, especially 
Romanians now flooding into Hungary because of ethnic strife, could use Hungary 
as an easy transit route to the West by simply walking into Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-line Czechoslovakia and East Germany, both heavily resisting Soviet-style 
reforms, are likely to resent the removal of the physical barriers along 
Hungary's western border for fear it will attract their citizens who might 
escape while on vacation in Hungary.

Israeli soldiers forced a Palestinian teen-age boy to sit on the front of their 
jeep in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, apparently as a human 
shield to prevent attacks by Arab stone-throwers. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was filmed by Visnews, the London-based international television 
news agency, and screened for reporters. The footage showed three soldiers 
shooting rubber bullets toward stone-throwers in the town center. 
</P>
<P>
The film then showed the troops driving through Ramallah in a jeep with a 
Palestinian teen-ager sitting on the jeep's hood, grasping a metal bar and 
looking frightened. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters monitoring army radios in the area said they heard a soldier say: 
"It's OK now. We have a kid on the front of the jeep. We won't get stoned." 
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said a soldier has been summoned to a disciplinary hearing in 
connection with the incident.

DRIVER GETS 10 YEARS FOR DEATH CAPTURED ON TAPE 
</P>

After hearing two hours of emotional testimony, a judge Tuesday sentenced Danny 
David Ornelas, 19, to 10 years in prison for running down and killing a Newport 
Beach mother of three while a passenger inadvertently videotaped the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It is with a heavy heart that I do this, Mr. Ornelas, but I must do what I 
must do," said Orange County Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas was convicted by a jury March 20 of gross vehicular manslaughter in the 
death of Debbie Killelea, 37, in an alley behind her Balboa Peninsula home. Two 
young sons, who were with her, narrowly escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas was found to have a blood alcohol content of .18 at the time of the 
Sept. 1 incident, almost twice the level at which a person is considered to be 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
The crime drew wide interest, largely because of an eerie videotape made by a 
passenger in the speeding car. The videotape showed Killelea trying to run out 
of the car's way as it bore down on her. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, who did not testify at his trial, told the judge Tuesday that he was 
sorry for the incident, which he described as "tragic." Ornelas, who appeared 
to be weeping, said he would do everything he could to try to make up for the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's husband, Brian Killelea, 40, testified that his family had been 
"devastated" by the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a vindictive person; however, I represent the American family, and 
all I want is justice served," Killelea said. He broke into tears on the 
witness stand as he spoke about his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, of Huntington Park, was charged with second-degree murder in 
Killelea's death, based on the allegation that he did not brake the speeding 
car, despite seeing Debbie Killelea and her two sons walking in the narrow 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
After five days of deliberation, the jury convicted Ornelas of gross vehicular 
manslaughter while intoxicated. Had Ornelas been convicted of second-degree 
murder, he could have been sentenced to up to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas will be eligible for parole in about five years.

6 RIOT POLICE OFFICERS KILLED IN BATTLE WITH STUDENTS AT S. KOREAN UNIVERSITY

Six riot police officers were killed in fighting with radical students today 
when police raided a university in the southeastern port of Pusan to rescue 
five officers being held hostage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 other officers and students were injured in the fighting, 10 of them 
seriously. The national Yonhap news agency said the death toll could rise 
because seven officers were hospitalized with serious burns. 
</P>
<P>
Police said about 700 officers launched a dawn raid on the library building at 
Dongui University to rescue the officers, who were seized Tuesday after a clash 
between students and riot police. 
</P>
<P>
Students on the seventh floor of the school library set fire to inflammable 
liquid. When troopers burst in several were set on fire, the officials said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Yonhap said the students, who fled to the roof of the building with the 
hostages, later released them. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the officers, wrapped in flames, leaped out of windows and others 
choked to death on the smoke or were badly burned, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Korean Broadcasting System, the state television network, said 88 students were 
arrested in the raid. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from the South Korean government, which has 
issued increasingly dire warnings in recent weeks of the dangers of what it 
calls leftist extremism in campus and labor protests. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Roh Tae Woo hinted he might have to take emergency powers 
to quell the violence.

Two Jackson Pollock drip paintings expected to fetch millions were among the 
offerings Tuesday in the first night of a 12-day, $600-million auction of art 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock's "Number 8, 1950," estimated at $8 million to $10 million, and "Number 
19, 1949," estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million, were expected to ring up 
the largest prices at the opening of the sale by Sotheby's and Christie's, the 
city's biggest auction houses, and Habsburg, Feldman, a Geneva-based 
auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous amount of interest and purchasing power around the 
world," said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America. "There is 
heavy buying from Europeans and tremendous interest from the Far East, 
especially Japan. Korean buyers are now emerging. And I would not count the 
Americans out, either." 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's and Christie's were to auction 4,472 works, starting with 
contemporary art sales this week, and hope to bring in $572 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Among the works to be auctioned Tuesday was "Triptych May-June," completed by 
Francis Bacon in 1973 and inspired by the suicide of the artist's close friend, 
George Dyer. It was expected to bring $3 million to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the auction block was Andy Warhol's "Red Jackie," portraying a 
ruby-lipped Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as First Lady in 1963. Its estimate 
before Tuesday's sale was $300,000 to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Red Marilyn," a 1964 depiction of Marilyn Monroe, will be offered at 
Christie's tonight. The estimate for the signed, synthetic polymer silk-screen 
on canvas is $1.5 million to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Sotheby's sale next Tuesday features Gaugin's "Mata Mua," completed in 1892 
during the artist's first trip to Tahiti. Estimated at $20 million to $25 
million, it is being sold by Jaime Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin 
fortune, and Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza.

The Navy has found the mechanical problem that caused a Trident 2 missile to 
explode last March, and corrective design changes will contribute to a 
three-month delay in deployment, a military official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said a Navy board of inquiry had 
blamed the failure on a mechanical linkage in the first-stage nozzle. The 
Pentagon previously had disclosed preliminary findings, made final by the Navy 
board. 
</P>

"We now expect the first operational missiles to be at sea on the (submarine)

The Navy's investigation began March 21, shortly after a Trident 2 missile 
fired from the Tennessee blew up four seconds after launch.

IOWA GUN TURRET DAMAGED IN BLAST CALLED REPAIRABLE

Navy engineers have determined that the 16-inch gun turret involved in a 
powerful explosion on the battleship Iowa April 19 can be repaired, Pentagon 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon still has not decided whether to fix it or how much it would 
cost. Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said that Navy workers Sunday succeeded in 
moving the turret's middle gun to its "center line," or normal position, 
indicating that the foot-thick steel walls of the structure have not been bent 
beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as investigators sifted through debris from the blast in an effort 
to pinpoint its cause, Navy officials confirmed that at least one of the 58 men 
in the turret apparently recognized that something had gone wrong moments 
before three successive explosions ripped through the six-story structure, 
killing 47 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said that just before the explosions, which occurred during a 
routine gunnery exercise, a crew member inside the turret said through a 
voice-activated telephone system, "Uh-oh, we've got a problem here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
550 Pounds of Explosives 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, some 550 pounds of explosive propellent ignited, instantly 
filling the chamber with hot gas that burned and asphyxiated its victims. 
</P>
<P>
Navy sources said that it still is not known whether there were defects in the 
bags of nitrocellulose mix used to propel 1,900-pound projectiles from the 
Iowa's guns or whether they were mishandled in the intricate and dangerous 
process of loading and preparing the gun for firing. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier firing of the 16-inch guns aboard the Iowa on April 19, a gun in 
another turret suffered a "hung round," or misfire, Gunner's Mate Kendall L. 
Truitt told the Virginian-Pilot recently. But Navy officials said that any 
malfunction of explosive powder in that chamber -- Turret One -- is likely to 
be unrelated to the blast that occurred in Turret Two, since the bags of powder 
came from different lots.

The toll of injured West Berlin police officers rose to 322 from a May Day 
march that erupted into the city's worst riot in several years, police said. A 
police spokesman said that about 2,000 marchers left the parade in the city's 
Kreuzberg district and pelted officers with stones, bottles and firebombs. 
Demonstrators, many of them masked, smashed windows of banks and shops, looted 
food and liquor stores, overturned and set fire to cars and built blazing 
barricades. Police, who used tear gas and water cannon to quell the 
demonstration, arrested at least 16 people.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has approved plans of another 36 states or 
territories to step up use of their National Guard units in fighting drug 
trafficking, the Pentagon said. The additional approvals bring to 48 the number 
of such plans now in place. The action makes the states eligible for extra 
federal funds from a congressional appropriation of $40 million approved last 
year to finance such Guard operations. Cheney announced the first approvals 
March 30, concentrating then on 12 high-priority border states, including 
California. Those 12 states together were authorized to use $11.8 million.

The United Mine Workers agreed to federal mediation in an effort to resolve its 
strike in Virginia against the Pittston Coal Group. Virginia Lt. Gov. Douglas 
Wilder said UMW President Richard L. Trumka agreed to accept a representative 
of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service at the bargaining table. The 
Pittston Co., the parent company of the coal mining firm, has already agreed to 
mediation. Trumka also sought a seven-day cooling off period in the 27-day-old 
strike, including a halt to Pittston operations, and immediate negotiations. 
Meanwhile, state police arrested 140 miners trying to keep coal trucks from 
leaving Pittston's Moss No. 3 preparation plant in Russell County and reported 
seven miners hurt when struck by a truck leading a convoy.

Gov. Mario Cuomo vetoed proposed legislation that would have permitted tuition 
increases at the four-year colleges of the City University of New York and the 
State University of New York. His action followed student protests that have 
all but shut down the City University system, but Cuomo insisted his decision, 
which came little more than an hour before a midnight deadline, was not a 
response to the protests but was based on what he called his "firm and 
long-standing opposition" to increasing tuition. CUNY student protests over the 
past week had included the seizure of more than a dozen college buildings in 
New York City.

About 70 people have been arrested during the last several months at truck 
stops in Fresno, Kings and Kern counties as part of a campaign against the sale 
and use of illegal drugs by truck drivers, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp 
said. Similar undercover operations have been conducted in the Southern 
California and Sacramento areas, he said, with the statewide arrest total in 
the campaign now about 250. Van de Kamp said he was surprised by how openly 
methamphetamines and other drugs are sold at truck stops in California.

Construction of two residential developments that would destroy old-growth pine 
trees used as perches by bald eagles at Big Bear Lake has been halted by order 
of San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge LeRoy Simmons. His order came in 
response to a complaint filed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp alleging that 
environmental impact reports prepared for the projects by the Big Bear 
Municipal Water District failed to comply with the state's Environmental 
Quality Act. Simmons, who ordered a halt until new reports can be prepared, 
also concluded that the water district must consider alternative sites and 
modifications to reduce the projects' impact on the environment. The developer, 
Big Bear Properties, could not be reached. But Jeri Mitchell, director of the 
water district, said the order could delay construction of 80 to 100 
residential sites on the northern and southern edge of the lake for "a year or 
longer." Federally endangered bald eagles migrate to the lake each winter from 
nesting grounds in the Pacific Northwest.

Lebanon's Christian leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, said he may compromise with 
Muslim militias to end the fighting in Beirut but will pursue diplomatic 
channels to oust Syrian troops from Lebanon. Aoun, commander of Lebanon's 
mainly Christian army, said he will consider lifting a blockade of three ports 
operated by Syrian-backed Muslim militias to try to end the current round of 
bitter fighting. As he spoke at a news conference, shelling duels continued 
between Christian gunners and an alliance of Druze militia and Syrian troops 
who have ignored Friday's cease-fire call by the Arab League. Police said at 
least two people were killed and eight wounded in the day of conflict.

A government task force recommended that physicians spend more time counseling 
patients on healthy living and less time doing routine screening tests. The 
task force, which reviewed more than 2,400 scientific studies, also concluded 
that some tests are ineffective as routine screening tools and should be used 
only on patients with symptoms or at high risk for the disease. The U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force, a 20-member panel of health-care experts 
appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services in 1984, compiled a 
nearly 300-page report on the effectiveness of more than 100 screening 
procedures.

The "Star Wars" missile defense program has selected five sites for 
consideration for an experimental system for storing huge amounts of electrical 
energy, the Defense Department said. The sites, in Wisconsin, New Mexico, Texas 
and Washington, will be studied more closely for their environmental 
suitability and a final decision will be made sometime next year. The project, 
known as the Superconductive Magnetic Energy Storage program, or SMES, will 
involve the construction of coils the size of a football field. The magnetic 
coils would hold electricity that can be "pumped in" when demand is low, then 
discharged when needed. The coils would utilize breakthroughs in fashioning 
materials that can conduct electricity with little or no loss of current. "Star 
Wars" officials are interested in the idea because of the problem of powering 
large, ground-based lasers that are being studied as a defense against 
missiles.

The United States has agreed to move its military headquarters in South Korea 
from central Seoul to rural areas, the South Korean Defense Ministry announced. 
It said the headquarters and other U.S. facilities in Seoul will be moved by 
the mid-1990s. South Korea wants to relocate the facilities to provide space 
for new offices and homes in the crowded capital. The headquarters of the 8th 
U.S. Army and other American forces have been in Seoul since the Korean War in 
1950-53.

KINGS' SUCCESS DOESN'T SAVE FTOREK'S JOB; 
</P>
<P>
WITH LACK OF PLAYERS' SUPPORT, CONTROVERSIAL COACH IS FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Kings fired Coach Robbie Ftorek on Tuesday, inviting him to a noon meeting 
with General Manager Rogie Vachon, who informed him that his contract would not 
be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
It was a move that had long been expected, and not even Ftorek was very 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek was not fired because of the Kings' record this season or because the 
Kings did not win the Stanley Cup. Their regular-season mark was 42-31-7, their 
third-best ever, good for fourth place overall in the league, up from 18th the 
previous season. 
</P>
<P>
After coming from a three-games-to-one deficit to win a seven-game playoff 
series against the defending champion Edmonton Oilers, the Kings lost in the 
second round to the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek was fired after his first full year as coach because he did not have the 
support of the players. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky was at odds with Ftorek this season, and many of the other Kings 
were frustrated with him at one time or another, voicing their feelings at 
their end-of-the-season meetings with Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, though, has been at the center of the criticism of Ftorek. Ftorek was 
not fired because of one confrontation with Gretzky in Detroit last November, 
but he was fired for reasons that are demonstrated by that confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Nov. 23, the Kings were beating the Red Wings and Gretzky was 
having what might have been a record night for points. When Gretzky felt that 
he had lapsed and contributed to a Detroit goal toward the end of the second 
period, he hit his stick on the back of the net in his anger at himself. 
</P>
<P>
In the dressing room between the second and third periods, Ftorek announced 
that Gretzky would be benched at the start of the third period because Ftorek 
wanted to teach the team to be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky fired back at Ftorek: "Robbie, if you want to teach, go back to New 
Haven. We're here to win the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
When Ftorek was brought up from the Kings' American Hockey League affiliate, 
the New Haven Nighthawks, in December of 1987, the Kings were a young and 
struggling team. But after trading a lot of young talent for Gretzky and 
several other veteran players, the team changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing that Ftorek's contract was not being extended, Vachon said: 
"Robbie is a teacher, a good technician, but now we have a team that is older, 
we have a lot of players who have been in the Stanley Cup finals, and it 
becomes a more difficult team to manage . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Our next coach is going to have to know how to deal with stars. We have a lot 
of stars. . . . Communication will be very important." 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek has also been widely criticized for his inability to deal with the 
media. But on the day that he was fired, a day that most coaches would feel was 
the best day to duck out the back door, Ftorek stood and faced the cameras. Not 
at the press conference, which took place in the Kings' dressing room. He was 
not scheduled there because people in the Kings' front office did not think it 
would be "appropriate" for him to appear with Vachon. Ftorek made himself 
available in the lounge of the hotel across the street from the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he agreed with the assessment that he had not communicated well with 
the players, Ftorek said: "If that's a flaw of mine, then it's something that 
I'll have to work on. But I don't know that that's true." 
</P>
<P>
And asked if he harbored any hard feelings against the players, Ftorek seemed 
stunned. "The players?" he asked. "No! We have a great group of players." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Gretzky had been consulted concerning the decision to fire Ftorek, 
Vachon said: "Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
As for whether the players had been happy playing under Ftorek, Vachon said: 
"Now everything is emphasized because of 99. But it happens every year that you 
can't keep all of the players happy all of the time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This year we made a lot of changes. We have a lot of new players, like 12 of 
them. Robbie was doing very well with the kids, but then we came in with a lot 
of different players." 
</P>
<P>
It was the member of the staff who the players liked best, Cap Raeder, who was 
told Tuesday that he would be kept on. Bryan Maxwell, a holdover from the staff 
of Mike Murphy, was told that his contract would not be extended. Murphy had 
been fired and replaced by Ftorek. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a wise decision for them to keep Cap," Ftorek said. "He's a 
good coach. It's good to have somebody around who knows the players and who 
knows what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings gave no indication who the next coach will be. Team owner Bruce 
McNall was in New York for meetings of the NHL's expansion committee and was 
not available for comment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, too, was in New York, reportedly getting ready for a taping of the 
television show "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
Vachon said that the interviewing process would begin soon and that the Kings 
intended to hire a new coach before the NHL draft and meetings in mid-June. 
</P>

WARRIORS USE A FULL NELSON TO SWEEP JAZZ

<P>
The series was a sweep, just like most everyone predicted. Three games and 
done. Broom, broom, out go the lights. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State Warriors had already cast themselves as the little team that 
could, Don Nelson having coached his shorty lineup to a 23-game improvement 
from last season, but now they are something else. They are in the Western 
Conference semifinals after stunning the Utah Jazz -- and the entire National 
Basketball Assn. -- with a 120-106 victory Tuesday night at Oakland Coliseum 
Arena to take the first-round series, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Something else, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before it would be a miracle if we win it," Nelson said afterward. "But 
miracles do happen, and one just happened tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around a long time. I can't ever remember being more proud of a team 
or remember a bigger win." 
</P>
<P>
Three Warriors scored 20 points or more -- Chris Mullin with 35, Mitch Richmond 
with 26 the day after being named the league's rookie of the year, and Terry 
Teagle with 24 off the bench -- and two others broke double figures. In the 
biggest game for the franchise in years, contributions came from almost 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe even above. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it was a miracle," Nelson said, continuing with a theme that will no 
doubt be retold in these parts for a long time. "For us to win three straight 
against such a good team, against a team that almost beat the Lakers in seven 
games last season, for us to do what we did, we had to have had help from 
somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
The capacity crowd of 15,025 cut loose with 2:37 remaining -- in the third 
quarter. "Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!" they chanted, proclaiming a notion that no one 
would have dared even dream a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, the fourth-place team out of the Pacific Division with a 43-39 
record, led at that point, 71-66, and were in the midst of a 12-0 streak. When 
Golden State finished the third quarter with a 7-0 run, it was 82-71. A close 
game had turned into a double-digit deficit for the Midwest Division champions, 
and it would get worse in the fourth quarter, reaching 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
When Utah made one last run and cut the lead to 94-88 with 5:25 left, Manute 
Bol, Golden State's 7-foot-7 string bean of a cult hero, hit what has become 
his obligatory three-point shot with 5:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Higgins hit another three-pointer and it was over, for good. 
</P>
<P>
The kid who held up a home-made sign in the front row had it right: A 
poster-size envelope, addressed to Bol was stamped in red ink, "Return to 
Sender." The return address was Karl Malone at 0-3 Dead End Street. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't dream about sweeping a team like Utah," said Warrior guard 
Winston Garland, who contributed 11 points. "They're too good." 
</P>
<P>
A playoff upset of this magnitude hasn't happened in the NBA since the New 
Jersey Nets knocked off the Philadelphia 76ers, the defending champions, in the 
first round in 1984. What made Utah-Golden State all the more improbable -- 
beyond the fact that the Jazz is one of the most talented teams in the league 
-- is that the Warriors closed the regular season with six consecutive losses, 
two coming against teams that didn't make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Then they won the first two games of the series at Salt Lake City, breaking a 
five-game losing streak there in the process. Mullin scores 41 and 22 points, 
respectively, Richmond gets 30 and 21, and Bol blocks a combined 13 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Warriors returned home, where they went 29-12 during the regular 
season, and played Utah just about even in the first half. They trailed, 49-48, 
at the intermission, but had a couple impressive stretches and shut down the 
Jazz inside game despite the usual size disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State used a 17-2 run (including a 12-0 spurt) midway through the second 
quarter to take a 40-32 lead with 5:41 left in the half. Karl Malone's hook in 
the lane ended the drought for Utah and started the Jazz on a 17-8 surge to 
close the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors took control from there, earning a trip to the best-of-seven 
conference semifinals to meet the Phoenix Suns, beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
To Arizona they go. For at least one more series, heaven can wait.

JEALOUS MOUTHS THAT ROAR DON'T FLUSTER THE LAKERS 
</P>

<P>
This playoff series has been far too tranquil for Mychal Thompson's combative 
nature, so the free-thinking and fast-talking Laker center is trying to change 
that with perhaps his most potent weapon -- his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for tonight's third game of the best-of-five National Basketball 
Assn. first-round series, which the Lakers lead two games to none, Thompson 
said he believes that the Trail Blazers genuinely dislike the Lakers and are 
jealous of their dominance in recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"They hate us," Thompson said. "I know that just from talking to them all 
summer. They don't respect the Lakers one bit. There's a jealousy there." 
</P>
<P>
A former Trail Blazer, Thompson keeps a summer home in nearby Lake Oswego. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he has seen evidence of disrespect in the first two playoff games, 
such as Portland center Kevin Duckworth body-slamming Magic Johnson late in 
Game 2 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some Trail Blazers, and some Lakers, laughed off Thompson's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you take anything Mychal says seriously?" Portland guard Terry Porter 
asked. "That's the guy who wants to be prime minister of the Bahamas." 
</P>
<P>
But other Portland players said that Thompson knows what it is like because he 
used to hate the Lakers, too, before joining them during the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I came up here to play (1978-79), the Blazers would always come 
close to the Lakers but never beat them," Thompson said. "It drives you crazy. 
After a while, you'd build up a hatred. They get sick of seeing us. 
</P>
<P>
"I lift weights (in Portland) in the summer with Jerome (Kersey), Steve Johnson 
and Terry (Porter), and all they talk about is how they are going to overtake 
us. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see that lack of respect in the way Duckworth knocked down Earvin and 
how Clyde (Drexler) was knocking around A. C. (Green) at the start of last 
game. That's what I mean by hating us. They don't look intimidated at all." 
</P>
<P>
Those minor incidents aside, it almost appears as if the Trail Blazers have 
shown too much respect for the Lakers during this series. 
</P>
<P>
They hardly have put up a fight in the first two games at the Forum. They never 
led either game and had only brief surges of strong play, such as the 23-8 run 
in the last six minutes of Game 2 to avoid another 20-point blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, at least, Portland's players and coach, Rick Adelman, have praised 
the Lakers' dominance thus far. But the Trail Blazers say that playing at home, 
where they lost twice to the Lakers during the regular season, will improve 
their play significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Kersey, asked if the Trail Blazers dislike the Lakers, said: "I think we do, 
more or less. In my five years here, you're always being compared to the 
Lakers. They are the top echelon, and you get tired of hearing about them. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mychal says we don't respect them, it's because we can't respect them. 
Three or four years ago we were like that and we got intimidated when we played 
them. Now we try to do the opposite. We can't let them think they're better 
than us. 
</P>
<P>
"People always try to compare us. Any time you mess up, you hear the same 
thing. It's like, 'Well, the Lakers wouldn't have done that.' But you have to 
realize that we're not the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
The disparity between the teams never has been more evident than in the first 
two games of the series. The closest the Trail Blazers came to leading during 
the second half of either game has been three points. 
</P>
<P>
Portland has made 42.9% of its shots, the Lakers 51.8%. The Lakers hold a 95-86 
rebounding advantage over the taller, more physical Trail Blazers. The Laker 
bench, considered a weak link this season, has outscored Portland's reserves, 
57-48. 
</P>
<P>
Such lopsided statistics are hardly fuel for a feud, especially since the Trail 
Blazers have lost seven straight games to the Lakers this season, including all 
five regular-season meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trail Blazers say they don't like feeling inferior to the Lakers and 
that the feeling serves as motivation, even during regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a hatred like Detroit-Cleveland," Porter said. "It's a respect-hatred 
type of thing. We're trying to get respect. They get up to play us. They do 
that against any team trying to beat them. But I think we get up more for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler, the team leader who is averaging 29 points and slightly fewer than 10 
assists in the two playoff games, took it upon himself to clarify Thompson's 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we hate them," Drexler said. "But we don't like them, either. 
That's the general consensus. It's not resentment. It's a lack of respect. 
You'd like to beat the . . . out of them." 
</P>
<P>
Laker players did not seem particularly upset when told that the Trail Blazers 
are not exactly fans of theirs. In fact, they seemed more annoyed at Thompson 
for speaking out than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just Mychal," Johnson said. "He's the one who spends time with them and 
lifts weights with them, so I guess he knows. I'm only close with Clyde, and he 
seems like he likes us." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riley, the Lakers' coach, simply shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't the only team that feels that way about it," Riley said. "But I 
don't really see (hatred) on the court. It isn't hatred, it's envy. If that is, 
in fact, what's coming from them, I think they are channeling it in the wrong 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"They may be (envious) because they look at us and see a team that's playing 
together, that's won for a long time, that's got all the pieces together . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
And one that has won 17 consecutive first-round playoff games and is one 
victory from advancing to the Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had all 12 players practicing Tuesday at the Coliseum for the first 
time in two weeks. Reserve center Mark McNamara, rehabilitating a badly 
sprained right ankle, participated and ran for the first time since suffering 
the injury. . . . Byron Scott, playing despite a sore right hand, said a day 
off Monday helped the condition. Scott has been receiving daily treatments of 
ice and electronic stimulation. "A couple of days ago it got so bad that I 
couldn't even use it to open the refrigerator," Scott said. "It got all purple 
and swollen around the palm. It would hurt when I'd go to shoot the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Portland Coach Rick Adelman said that he hasn't settled on a starting lineup. 
He might again start Danny Young at guard and move Clyde Drexler to a forward 
to improve the Trail Blazers' running game. Adelman's other option is to start 
Sam Bowie at power forward to give the Trail Blazers another 7-footer to go 
with center Kevin Duckworth. Bowie, bothered by a chronically sore right ankle, 
did not practice again Tuesday but probably will play. "We've got to get off to 
a good start (tonight)," Adelman said. "We used the small lineup (Young 
starting) the other day to try to do that, but Clyde got in foul trouble and we 
couldn't use it. But I like that lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said he expects to see Portland's small lineup again. 
"Rick never got what he wanted out of that lineup because of the foul trouble, 
so we don't know how it would've worked," Riley said. "All I know is that 
they'll play better at home. They'll be more relaxed." . . . Adelman said that 
it is a mistake to believe that the Trail Blazers have given up, which is the 
sentiment among many in Portland. "That's a natural assumption, but I can't 
concern myself with that," Adelman said. "I don't think it's over, but I can 
understand people's logic. We've lost seven straight to them. But we're a much 
better team at home. I think the Lakers will want to finish us off quickly. But 
once we win a game, then you can't tell me we won't win again on Friday night 
(in Game 4). Then, in a fifth game, anything could happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have airline reservations for Thursday and Saturday, pending the 
outcome of tonight's game. "We want to win the first game, take care of 
business and get outta here," Scott said. "We didn't come up here thinking we 
have to win one of two. Let's win and go home." . . . If the Lakers win 
tonight, it will be the sixth consecutive season in which they have swept a 
first-round playoff opponent. . . . In the last three seasons, the Trail 
Blazers have lost four of six home playoff games.

Now, less than two years later, Finley is one of only seven 1987 draft picks 
playing in the major leagues. Five of those were first-round selections. The 
sixth, Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Steve Carter, was taken on the 17th round. 
</P>
<P>
Finley's rise wasn't simply meteoric; it was astonishing. The most incredible 
aspect of his story, however, is the reason he slipped through baseball's 
massive scouting network virtually unnoticed: 
</P>
<P>
Clubs questioned his intensity. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Braves drafted Finley in 1986, but he chose to finish his degree 
rather than turn pro. It is clear his decision turned off many teams. It is 
just as clear that very few people did their homework on Finley. 
</P>
<P>
Only four current players reached the majors as quickly from Finley's draft 
position or lower -- Carter, Texas Rangers catcher Mike Stanley, Kansas City 
Royals pitcher Bret Saberhagen and Oakland A's pitcher Rick Honeycutt. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for their swift promotions were varied; Finley benefited from the 
Orioles' switch to a youth movement. Still, it's worth noting that Jose Canseco 
(15th round) and Don Mattingly (19th) are among those who required more time 
than Finley in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
Finley possesses the requisite tools -- he can run, throw and hit -- but more 
important, he exhibits an intensity rarely seen in young players. That is why 
Orioles hitting coach Tom McCraw said he saw greatness in Finley this spring. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw offers no guarantees -- "A thousand things can change a young man's mind 
between now and then," he said -- but the Orioles remain enthralled with their 
rookie phenom. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, 23, is batting only .217 after coming off the disabled list with a 
sprained right shoulder, but he already has five RBI in 23 at-bats, including 
two game-winners. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in Oakland, he threw out a runner at second from right field and made 
a sliding catch in center to help preserve a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"His reputation preceded him," Orioles Manager Frank Robinson said. "You have a 
little bit of a feel for him, but you still held a little reservation -- you 
say this just sounds too good to be true. Then you see him do things, and you 
say let's wait a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"But the more and more you see him, you can't believe it. You just shake your 
head. This is the type of makeup great players have when they first step on the 
field. It doesn't matter what level they play at, it's the same type of 
instincts, the same type of results." 
</P>
<P>
It seems so obvious now. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, who knew? 
</P>
<P>
The first Orioles communication regarding Finley was a note exchanged between 
two scouts in the spring of 1986, Finley's senior year at Southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Uhlman Sr., now a special assistant to general manager Roland Hemond, saw 
Finley play one game in Florida. He sent word to Mike Ledna, the Orioles' scout 
in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Ledna, too, saw Finley play just once, on a cold, rainy Sunday in Peoria, Ill. 
Impressed, he filed a report, just as he does on 25 to 30 potential draft picks 
each year. Then he began checking into Finley's background, never once meeting 
with the player himself. 
</P>
<P>
That's not unusual, but things were different before the inception of the draft 
in 1966. Scouts prowled their territories for talent, signing players at will. 
The process was far more personal, Hemond said, and scouts often visited 
players in their homes, just as college coaches visit recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to know a player's makeup than it used to be," Hemond said. "Maybe 
no one from your organization has talked to him. You figure you may not get a 
shot at him. You only get one pick every 26. We've all made some mistakes not 
knowing young players well enough before drafting them. You have to have some 
degree of luck." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles got lucky with Finley, but they did some checking, too. First, 
Ledna consulted with Southern Illinois coach Richard "Itchy" Jones, who played 
a critical role in Finley's development. Then he called a friend in the Braves' 
organization, asking why Finley did not sign after his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted to complete his degree, largely because of the influence of his 
family. His father, Howard, is the dean at Paducah (Ky.) Middle School. His 
mother, Fran, works at Paducah Tilghman High. Finley grew up in a home that 
stressed the value of education. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point in his thinking, however, occurred when he broke his leg in 
West Virginia playing in a summer league after his freshman year. "He learned 
from that experience that nothing is a sure thing, that in a moment your life 
can change," Fran Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
Finley was accepted into chiropractor's school after majoring in physiology at 
Southern Illinois. "It was worth my while to finish up my last year of school," 
he said. "I knew what I wanted to do. I didn't really care." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ledna, the Orioles' scout, "It's always a concern when a kid after his 
junior year in college turns down good money, fair money. But the Atlanta 
people told me up and down the kid was serious about education. I didn't see 
that as a problem. This kid wasn't jacking anybody around. But I'm sure teams 
and scouts shied away because he didn't sign after his junior year." 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, it became evident to the Orioles that Finley wasn't an ordinary 14th 
round pick. He spent the summer at Class A, began the '88 season at the same 
level and finished with the International League batting title. Ledna, for one, 
was stunned by how quickly he adapted from the aluminum bats in college to the 
wooden models used by the pros. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen all the minor-league players," McCraw said, "but if I had to 
pick two guys that were going to be great ballplayers over a 10-year stretch, 
that's Gregg Jefferies and Steve Finley." Jefferies, an infielder for the New 
York Mets, is another phenom whose work habits are legendary. McCraw instructed 
him in the Mets' minor-league system.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mood Monday was hardly one of fear or desperation. Nothing that transpired 
on the Boston Garden floor would lead an onlooker to think that it might be the 
last practice of a long season for the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Parish, kept out of shooting drills because of his tender right elbow, 
mercilessly mocked teammates Kelvin Upshaw and Ron Grandison. Larry Bird 
perspired like Moses Malone and stayed for some three-on-three with the scrubs. 
He is still on hold until the next series, or next season, whichever comes 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gamble and Dennis Johnson watched from the sideline in sweat suits, 
hoping their bodies would do the impossible in 24 hours: stop hurting. 
</P>
<P>
And the coach? Did he feel as if he were standing on a trap door with Detroit 
Pistons stars Isiah Thomas or Dennis Rodman holding the lever? 
</P>
<P>
"We're three victories away from winning this series," Jimmy Rodgers said. 
"That's the way we're approaching this." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, however, are only one victory away, having held serve in the 
Palace with defensive-oriented 101-91 and 102-95 victories. They can close out 
things Tuesday night with a victory, which would make them only the third team 
to sweep the Celtics in a playoff series (Milwaukee 4-0 in 1983; New York 2-0 
in 1951). 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics don't have to be told what it's like to be up 2-0 in a best-of-five 
series; they were in such a position in 1984, '85, '86, '87 and '88. In three 
cases, they dropped Game 3 before administering the coup de grace in Game 4. In 
the other two, they finished off their prey in the third game. 
</P>
<P>
"They definitely can smell blood now," Parish said of the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
And the Celtics? They hope to awaken Wednesday, smell the coffee, and head back 
to Boston Garden for another practice instead of to clear out their lockers. 
They have been eliminated in the first round of a playoff series only four 
times in 35 post-season forays, the last time 33 years ago to the Syracuse 
Nats. 
</P>
<P>
And, despite Pistons Coach Chuck Daly's typically pessimistic pronouncements 
("I expect this to go five games"), the Celtics would need something akin to a 
miracle to avoid a fifth first-round exit. 
</P>
<P>
They can take some solace from the site. They were 30-8 in Boston Garden this 
season and had won 12 straight in the 60-year-old home until their April 18 
defeat to the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a psychological lift to be at home, a pride thing," Parish said. "Plus, 
the mood now is very relaxed. No one is up-tight, although we do know we have 
our hands full." 
</P>
<P>
And even the best of road teams (such as the Pistons, who were an NBA-leading 
26-15) have had trouble away from home in the playoffs. For instance, the 
1985-86 Celtics were 27-14 on the road; in the playoffs they were 5-3. The 
1986-87 Los Angeles Lakers were 28-13 on the road and also were 5-3 on the road 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
So, there is hope, even if neither of the above lost a game in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely in for a dogfight there," Mark Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics can also be optimistic about their chances given their play in each 
of the first two games. The problem each time has been one lousy quarter 
undoing three pretty solid ones. Against Detroit, that's too much to give away, 
however.

JAMES FLANIGAN: MERGER MANIA AT AD AGENCIES JUST WON'T SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hype strikes again. Another big buyout looms in the advertising world with the 
$725-million bid by Britain's WPP Group to take over Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which 
would be the latest of half a dozen U.S. ad agencies to be bought by British 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. companies have bought British agencies, French 
advertising companies are threatening to buy the British -- and Dentsu of 
Japan, one of the world's largest ad agencies, hasn't even entered the fray. 
</P>
<P>
What's behind it? The concept of global media. That's the idea that because 
hundreds of millions of people in many countries now buy similar, if not 
identical products -- a Toyota in France being little different from one in 
Bangkok or Baltimore -- the communications media have a growing value. 
</P>
<P>
The spirit driving advertising mergers is similar to the thinking behind Time 
Inc. merging with Warner Communications, or Sony buying CBS Records, or Rupert 
Murdoch owning newspapers on three continents and launching satellite TV 
channels. The idea is that a global communicator can reach more customers 
economically than a national one. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty is in deciding which medium to put your money on. Newspapers 
have survived competition from TV, but now worry about direct-response 
advertising through the mails and computers. Broadcast television is worried by 
cable, and cable is worried by potential competition from telephone companies 
stringing fiber optics into the home. 
</P>
<P>
The only certainty, it seems, is that an advertising agency will be part of the 
process of reaching customers. No matter what medium is used, the agency will 
channel the advertiser's message. 
</P>
<P>
As Alan Gottesman, analyst for the Paine Webber investment firm, sums it up: 
"If you're not sure which spoke will bear the weight, it always makes sense to 
bet on the hub." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Behind the Scenes Fees 
</P>
<P>
That's the concept, and financial markets are buying it. But a caution here for 
investors who might think that advertising firms are sure-fire merger 
candidates: There's a flaw in the concept and a weakness in the current 
takeover wave. 
</P>
<P>
So be wary as you see consolidation in the ad business continue, as it will. 
For there are reasons smaller firms are merging into larger holding companies. 
It has to do with fees and services behind the scenes, where the money really 
is made in the ad business. 
</P>
<P>
The ad game may be known for creative symbols, from the Volkswagen bug to the 
California raisins, but the money is made in less glamorous production 
services, in fees for filming and printing, for distribution, for this and that 
service. Ogilvy's attraction for WPP in fact may lie less in its stylish ads 
than in its No. 1 position in direct response advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's merger makers are not ad people," says Jerry Della Femina, head of 
Della Femina, McNamee WCRS Inc., "they're building communications companies." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but if that's such a good idea, why aren't big American investors -- the 
Bass brothers or the Pritzkers -- being more aggressive about it? 
</P>
<P>
Simple. Because advertising is becoming a less profitable business. That's 
where the flaw is. The big companies being created are not inherently more 
profitable than the smaller firms they're gobbling up. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising companies as a rule made higher returns on capital years ago than 
they do today. That results, says Gottesman, from international giants adding 
staff and costs at the same time that advertisers are driving down the rates 
they're willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
So costs are growing but not profits -- guaranteeing that someday soon the very 
companies now being put together will be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, if you're small, you're at a disadvantage in bidding for 
business, says Della Femina -- a creative legend who recently gave us the Joe 
Isuzu commercials. Della Femina sold out last year to a British firm, White, 
Collins, Rutherford &amp; Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The British have been most prominent in advertising mergers: Saatchi &amp; 
Saatchi owns Ted Bates, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample and Backer &amp; Spielvogel; 
WPP owns J. Walter Thompson and now wants Ogilvy. 
</P>
<P>
But an accounting anomaly helps explain that prominence, and therein lies 
another weakness in the current takeover wave. British accounting rules allow 
firms to increase reported profits through mergers faster than would be the 
case for U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
That makes British ad firms look more profitable than they otherwise might be 
and also indicates that the economics behind those takeovers is artificial. To 
the extent that it is so, the merger wave is vulnerable to correction in the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
But correction may not come immediately. The latest news is that French 
advertising agencies are threatening the British with takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
So the buyout game will go on until that moment when somebody wakes up and asks 
whether merger prices make sense -- that moment, as Madison Avenue might put 
it, when they run up the flag and nobody salutes.

DAVIS CALLS TIME OUT IN BID TO TAKE CONTROL OF NWA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wealthy Los Angeles oilman Marvin Davis, in an abrupt about-face, declared a 
truce Tuesday in his battle for control of NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Davis agreed to drop his campaign to unseat NWA's board with his own slate of 
directors and to postpone purchases of NWA stock under his outstanding 
$90-a-share tender offer. In return, NWA agreed to give Davis confidential 
information about the company's financial condition to assist him in making a 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire between Davis and NWA is a sharp turning point in Davis' 
aggressive, monthlong pursuit of the airline company, which is based in Eagan, 
Minn. Until Tuesday, Davis had employed a wide range of tactics to gain control 
of NWA, which twice rejected his $2.7-billion cash offer. 
</P>
<P>
Investment analysts speculated Tuesday that Davis sought the truce with NWA 
because he faced an uphill battle to replace the airline's board. Also, with 
NWA's shares trading at about $102 each, Davis' tender offer stood little 
chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was fighting "a losing battle," said Daniel A. Hersh, an airline industry 
analyst with the Los Angeles investment firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards 
Inc. "It's clear that his bid would not be approved, and the proxy battle would 
not be won." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis' attorney said both sides sought the agreement. "It's fair to say 
that it was mutual," said George A. Vandeman, a partner with Latham &amp; 
Watkins in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who owns 3% of NWA's shares, had initially balked at signing a 
confidentiality agreement with NWA because he believed that the terms were too 
restrictive. In return for confidential information, NWA demanded that 
prospective bidders not make a hostile bid for the company or accumulate 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's agreement allows Davis to resume a hostile bid for the company after 
June 30, if NWA has not decided to sell the company by then. The agreement 
allows Davis to buy shares under his tender offer after June 30 and also allows 
him to launch a second effort to unseat NWA's board after that date. For its 
part, NWA said it would give Davis 10 days' notice if it plans to pursue 
"non-sale" alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement protects and preserves our rights to deal directly with our 
fellow NWA stockholders should we become convinced that the process is not 
moving in a direction which we believe truly serves stockholders' interests," 
Davis said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Hersh, the Bateman Eichler analyst, speculated that NWA agreed to modify the 
terms of its confidentiality agreement to avoid a disruptive proxy battle. 
Davis and NWA also agreed not to proceed, at least temporarily, with lawsuits 
filed against each other in courts in Minnesota and in Delaware, where NWA is 
incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
NWA's board is exploring a number of options for the company, including a 
special dividend, a stock buyback or a sale of the airline. NWA Chairman and 
Chief Executive Steven G. Rothmeier has said he hopes to find an investor who 
is willing to act as a "white squire" by taking a large stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Davis, NWA has been approached by up to four other investors who are 
interested in a "friendly" takeover of the airline. They have been asked to 
sign confidentiality agreements that bar a hostile bid for the company. 
</P>
<P>
One of the friendly investors is known to be Alfred A. Checchi, a Los Angeles 
investor who leads a group that owns 4.9% of NWA's shares. Among the others are 
thought to be two New York investment firms that specialize in leveraged 
buyouts -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. 
Also named as a possible NWA investor is Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of 
Revlon.

Act III Completes Purchase of Theaters: Act III Communications, a Los 
Angeles-based communications firm controlled by veteran television producer 
Norman Lear, completed its purchase of Luxury Theatres, a chain of 293 theater 
screens in 87 locations in the West and Northwest, for an estimated $150 
million. With its other holdings, its Act III Theatres subsidiary now has 473 
screens in 114 locations in seven states, making it the ninth-largest U.S. 
motion picture exhibitor, the company said. Extensive real estate ownership was 
a major factor in the purchase, according to Scott C. Wallace, president and 
chief executive of Act III Theatres, which is based in San Antonio.

Judge Won't Trim Sentence: A federal judge rejected a request to cut the 
eight-year sentence of self-styled financial adviser David Bloom, who admitted 
diverting $10 million of investors' money to fund a lavish life style. Bloom, 
24, of Manhattan, is serving two consecutive four-year sentences at the 
Allenwood, Pa., federal prison camp after pleading guilty to one count each of 
mail fraud and securities fraud. He asked U.S. District Judge David N. 
Edelstein to reduce the prison term because it was "harsh," compared to the 
sentences of other white-collar criminals and because Bloom is remorseful and 
undergoing psychological treatment. But Edelstein noted that Bloom's crime 
"involved cheating friends and colleagues," while other convicted white-collar 
thieves were charged with "crimes that, although they involved more money, 
involved fraud on the system, not particular individuals."

AMR to Order Commuter Planes: The parent of American Airlines confirmed 
published reports that it will order up to 100 commuter aircraft to equip its 
regional airlines. The airline company, based at Dallas-Ft. Worth airport, is 
reportedly leaning toward the Swedish manufacturer Saab for the order, although 
the airline is still evaluating different aircraft types. AMR said it will 
place firm orders in a few weeks for 50 36-seat turboprop aircraft with an 
option for purchase of an additional 50.

TAKEOVER ARTIST BILZERIAN CALLED 'PHONY' AT TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
Takeover artist Paul A. Bilzerian was a "phony" who deceived investors, 
corporate targets and the government to make millions in hostile raids, a 
federal prosecutor charged Tuesday at the opening of Bilzerian's securities 
fraud trial. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian, who is chairman of Singer Co., borrowed other people's money to make 
himself appear formidable to corporate targets, Assistant U.S. Atty. David 
Brodsky said in his opening statement. On top of that deception, Bilzerian hid 
his ownership of stock under the name of former securities executive Boyd L. 
Jefferies to strengthen his hand in raids, Brodsky charged. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the lies brought him lots of money," the prosecutor said. "Today, 
they bring him to the bar of justice." 
</P>
<P>
The case is the latest to go to trial from the family of Wall Street corruption 
cases that grew from the leads provided by imprisoned stock speculator Ivan F. 
Boesky. As with the trial of GAF Corp. and one of its executives, it will rely 
heavily on the testimony of Jefferies, the founder and longtime head of the Los 
Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co. securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian is charged with 11 counts of violating securities and tax laws by 
failing to disclose his stock holdings. The case centers on failed corporate 
raids against four companies: apparel maker Cluett-Peabody &amp; Co., the H. H. 
Robertson construction concern, steelmaker Armco and Hammermill Paper Co. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian has asserted his innocence since he was indicted in December. One 
charge against him has been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Brodsky said that in 1985 Bilzerian didn't have nearly enough money to make the 
public think he should be taken seriously as a corporate raider. So he 
"concocted a formula for instant credibility" by borrowing large sums from 
investors, including shopping center magnate Edward DeBartolo, according to the 
prosecutor. Bilzerian made it appear that the money was his own, Brodsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian promised that he would split his profits evenly with investors and 
that they would be shielded from any loss, Brodsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Brodsky described Bilzerian as "a man of relatively modest wealth willing to 
put other people's wealth on the line -- in a word, a phony." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Bilzerian deceived the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the Internal Revenue Service about the source of his wealth and his 
ownership of stock. He used several means for hiding its ownership, Brodsky 
added. 
</P>
<P>
But Arthur Mathews, a Washington lawyer for Bilzerian, said the case should not 
have been brought and had come to trial only to justify the plea agreement 
prosecutors had reached with Jefferies. "The government strains to justify the 
bad bargain they made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mathews, apparently referring to Bilzerian, said Jefferies could not turn in 
anyone above him but had "implicated a few scapegoats." But Mathews insisted 
that "there has been no one hurt -- no one has been deprived of any money or 
property." 
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to call about 20 witnesses in the trial, the first 
of whom is due to testify today. Prosecutors declined Tuesday to disclose the 
identity of that first witness. 
</P>
<P>
The trial will be another important test of the credibility of Jefferies, who 
was strongly challenged by defense attorneys in the GAF Corp. stock 
manipulation trial. That case ended once in a mistrial and a second time with a 
deadlocked jury.

USA TODAY EXECUTIVE NAMED EDITOR OF ATLANTA PAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald D. Martin, one of the chief architects of USA Today, has been named 
editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, five months after the stormy 
resignation of editor and former New York Times Washington bureau chief Bill 
Kovach prompted protest marches in the streets Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Rosenfeld, who has served as interim editor, will become editor-in-chief 
of Cox Newspapers, the parent company of the Atlanta papers. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement signals an apparent return in philosophy at the Atlanta 
papers, which had consciously imitated USA Today's use of color and short 
stories before hiring Kovach from the New York Times in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Kovach promised to bring Atlanta "world class newspapers." The 
Journal-Constitution recently won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative 
reporting. But his efforts soon sparked conflict -- both with downtown business 
interests and those championing "redneck culture" -- a conflict that seemed to 
some to mirror the growing pains of Atlanta and the New South. 
</P>
<P>
When he suddenly resigned last fall, after disputes with management for control 
of budgets, philosophy and Washington coverage, the staff paid for a full-page 
ad in protest and later marched through the city's streets to get him back. 
</P>
<P>
In Martin, Atlanta will get the editor who headed the planning group that 
designed USA Today and was one of the "Gang of Four" Gannett officials who 
oversaw its early implementation, as they were known to USA Today staff. 
</P>
<P>
According to "The Making of McPaper," an in-house history of USA Today, Martin 
was initially bitter when he was passed over to be the paper's first editor. 
John Curley, now Gannett chairman, got the job. But Martin eventually was 
persuaded to stay. He has remained in the post of executive editor ever since, 
and in 1987 was given the title of vice president as well, in charge of 
coordination with Gannett papers. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said in an interview that while he thought some of USA Today's 
principles might translate to Atlanta, it also must be "the memory of the 
place, the paper of record to a degree" and thus do "a lot of things that are 
not terribly glitzy." 
</P>
<P>
Said Atlanta Publisher Jay Smith: "It would be a terrible mistake to infer that 
we are going to become an Atlanta version of USA Today any more than we ever 
intended to become an Atlanta version of the New York Times." 
</P>
<P>
Martin apparently was a late choice as replacement. Talks with him did not 
start until a few weeks ago and got serious only within the last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal-Constitution publishes in the morning as the Atlanta Constitution 
and in the afternoon as the Atlanta Journal on weekdays and in a combined 
edition on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspapers have a combined reporting staff but separate editorial staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Martin previously was editor of the Baltimore News-American and US magazine and 
was managing editor of the Cocoa (Fla.) Today, the Rochester Democrat and 
Chronicle, the Miami Herald and the New York Post. THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL

SECURITY PACIFIC SCRAPS PLAN TO BUY CENTRAL BANK IN BAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Security Pacific has canceled its plan to buy Central Bank, a 46-branch 
operation in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific agreed in December to acquire Central Bank from its holding 
company -- Central Banking System -- for $62.7 million in stock. Under the 
agreement, Central was required to have a net worth of at least $43.9 million 
if the merger were to be consummated. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was canceled Monday because the net worth of Central, headquartered in 
Walnut Creek, was $41.2 million as of Dec. 31. The figure was determined by 
auditors during a routine pre-merger examination of Central's financial status. 
</P>
<P>
Problem loans lowered Central's value, according to Grace Foster, a vice 
president of the bank. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1988, Central charged off 
$20.2 million in problem loans. Central Banking System registered a loss of 
$27.3 million for 1988, contrasted with a profit of about $10 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Central expects to report additional loan-related losses, according to a 
statement issued by Michael G. Rafton, chairman of the holding company. The 
bank is examining its loan problems and plans to announce the findings in the 
near future, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Central is the 17th-largest bank in California. Security Pacific, based in Los 
Angeles, is the state's second-largest bank. The banks said they agreed to 
cancel the merger because it was unlikely that the terms of the agreement could 
be met.

BIG LENDER PULLING OUT OF STATE STUDENT-LOAN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's largest and most controversial maker of government-guaranteed 
student loans announced that it is pulling out of the program, throwing into 
further disarray California's already chaotic student-loan market. 
</P>
<P>
The lender, First Independent Trust Co. of Sacramento, which has made $1.5 
billion in student loans nationwide since 1980, cited recent financial turmoil 
in the state's $6-billion student-loan market as the reason for its decision. 
That turmoil, it said, includes the drying up of money in the "secondary 
market" where lenders sell the student loans. 
</P>
<P>
What First Independent Trust did not mention in its announcement late Monday 
was that it has been given formal notice that it is about to be banned by state 
officials from making government-guaranteed student loans in California. The 
officials are alleging widespread and continuing violations by the trust 
company of student-loan program rules. It would be the first time a lender has 
been banned from making student loans, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said they have found that First Independent Trust failed to pay 
at least $4.5 million in fees owed to the federal government during the first 
six months of last year and another $1.25 million in refunds owed to investors 
holding student loans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about nit-picky things. We are talking about paying your 
bills when you are supposed to pay them and making your refunds when you are 
supposed to refund them. And we are talking about millions of dollars," said 
Samuel Kipp III, executive director of the California Student Aid Commission, a 
state agency that administers federal student-loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
But Jon D. Smock, a lawyer for First Independent Trust, said the company's 
decision to withdraw from making student loans is not related to the state 
action. 
</P>
<P>
He said the trust company disputes the state findings about its operations and 
plans to appeal the state's move to ban it from making student loans in the 
future. Smock said that as a result of First Independent's decision, about 
4,000 students will have to look elsewhere for their loans. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a private nonprofit 
group in Minnesota that guarantees student loans nationwide, said it will stop 
guaranteeing student loans made by First Independent Trust. The foundation 
guaranteed about 60% of First Independent's student loans, nearly all of them 
made to students out of state. 
</P>
<P>
First Independent Trust's action is the latest mess for the 
government-guaranteed student-loan market. The problems started when an Encino 
company, United Education &amp; Software, failed to properly "service" more 
than $1 billion in student loans. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, federal officials reviewed United Education's servicing operation 
and found the biggest foul-up ever in the history of the program. It included 
failing to send out thousands of letters to delinquent borrowers, sending 
letters to wrong addresses and stuffing hundreds of drawers full of documents 
waiting to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Because of those problems, U.S. Department of Education officials have decided 
that the government will not pick up the bill when students default on their 
loans. That has left on the hook some of the world's biggest banks, most of 
them based in Japan, which backed with letters of credit the bonds that were 
issued to buy the student loans from various lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, nine of those banks sued Bank of America, trustee for the bonds, 
alleging that they have lost more than $350 million in the fiasco and may lose 
up to $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
First Independent Trust has been California's largest student-loan lender in 
the past three years and among the top five nationwide. As it has grown, the 
company has become increasingly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
The company's aggressiveness in making student loans, primarily to vocational 
school students who have the highest default rate of any student group, has 
made some state and federal student-loan officials increasingly uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
One source of controversy has been First Independent Trust's supplying of 
computer equipment linking vocational schools with its offices. 
</P>
<P>
The company contends that that was done for convenience, but federal officials 
have said they consider it a way of inducing schools to send students for loans 
to the trust company and told First Independent to start charging for the 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said Tuesday that the company has not properly documented that 
it is charging for the equipment. However, Smock said this problem has been 
resolved.

POLAROID CHIEF SAYS FIRM TRIED TO BUILD OWN NICHE 
</P>

<P>
Polaroid Corp. took pains to avoid competition with Eastman Kodak Co., the 
Polaroid chairman testified Tuesday in the opening testimony in a trial over 
the amount of damages Kodak should pay for infringing on its rival's 
instant-photography technology. 
</P>
<P>
In U.S. District Court, Polaroid Chairman William J. McCune Jr. began to 
outline the steps that led to head-to-head competition with Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid, based in Cambridge, Mass., is seeking $12 billion in damages from 
Kodak for infringing on instant photography patents. An earlier court decision 
found that infringement occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak says it should pay $177 million, equal to 5% 
royalties on the instant cameras and film Kodak sold from 1976 until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
McCune said Polaroid and Kodak had a productive working relationship for 
decades. But it soured in the late 1960s, he said, when Polaroid was working on 
its revolutionary SX-70 camera. 
</P>
<P>
Kodak, which for years had manufactured film for Polaroid, was asked to produce 
the new, complex negative that Polaroid had developed for the instant color 
camera. But Kodak demanded a license from Polaroid, McCune testified, which 
would have allowed Kodak to develop its own instant photography. 
</P>
<P>
"There was considerable reluctance to undertake the project unless we gave them 
license," McCune said under questioning by Polaroid attorney Herbert Schwartz. 
"A stumbling block was always that we couldn't see how giving Kodak a license 
to make products competitive with ours would allow us to stay in business." 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Instant photography, McCune said, "is all our bread and butter and that's 
everything we've got." 
</P>
<P>
McCune's testimony before Judge A. David Mazzone ranged widely from the origins 
of instant photography after World War II to the introduction of the SX-70 
camera in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The story began during the war, McCune said, when Polaroid founder Edwin Land 
was in Santa Fe on a family trip. "He took photographs of his daughter and she 
asked why she couldn't see (them) right away," McCune said. "He wondered, too." 
</P>
<P>
By 1963, with manufacturing help from Kodak, Polaroid developed the first color 
instant photography. 
</P>
<P>
"The business grew rapidly in that period," McCune said. Revenue of $129 
million in 1963 jumped to $571 million in 1972. Polaroid's profits after taxes 
increased from $25 million to $75 million in that time. 
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of the SX-70, McCune said, Polaroid hoped for a dramatic 
increase in its business. 
</P>
<P>
"We viewed it as a revolutionary step and thought it was going to dramatically 
increase the business of the company and increase the life of the business," 
McCune said.

ANALYSTS DOUBT RULE WILL SLOW TRUMP'S PLANS 
</P>

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least one casino industry observer believes that Donald J. Trump was 
unfairly condemned when state regulators restricted his future investments in 
competing gaming companies. 
</P>
<P>
But other gaming analysts predicted Tuesday that Trump will not be frustrated 
by the restriction, part of a stipulation imposed Monday at Trump's casino 
re-licensing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In the stipulation, Trump agreed that neither he nor his affiliates would 
acquire directly or indirectly any securities of any holding or intermediary 
company with a New Jersey casino without the prior approval of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The stipulation affects future acquisitions and does not affect Trump's 
proposed purchase of Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel, which the billionaire 
developer has proposed converting into a luxury hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"He's making a nice cash flow on his investments in Atlantic City. I don't see 
why he would ever want to leave," said Harold Vogel, an analyst with Merrill 
Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said, however, that the state Casino Control Commission's restriction 
might frustrate Trump's interest in developing gaming halls in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wanted to make a run at Caesars World out there, for instance, and he's 
not permitted to buy stock here, it might affect his future in Las Vegas," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Roffman, a gaming analyst with the Philadelphia investment firm of 
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said Trump probably already has as much as he 
wants in Atlantic City. He already owns Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino 
hotels, and once he completes the massive Taj Mahal casino project, he will 
control 31.4% of the resort's gaming space, he said. Under state law, no one 
can own more than three casinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a 'Disgrace' 
</P>
<P>
But Roffman said the commission's restrictions on Trump's investments in other 
casino companies "was a disgrace. It was a closed-door kind of thing where the 
commissioners said, 'We think you're dominating the Atlantic City skyline and 
we won't license you unless you make the following pledge.' 
</P>
<P>
"This should have been subject to a formal hearing and aired in public," 
Roffman said. "You just don't condemn a guy without an open hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Saul Leonard, a gaming analyst for Laventhol &amp; Horwath of Philadelphia, 
said Trump knows he must bare his soul when appearing before the commission for 
his casino license renewal. 
</P>
<P>
"The casino license is a privilege, not a right," Leonard said.

BETTER ON-JOB TRAINING VITAL, MIT STUDY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CALLS IT KEY TO MATCHING JAPANESE IN PRODUCTIVITY

<P>
Better on-the-job training, even more than better schools, is the key to 
helping U.S. workers catch up to the Japanese and others in productivity, 
concluded an MIT report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Young Americans receive most of their job skills in institutions of formal 
learning, and what they pick up on the job is usually of a limited nature, 
gathered from watching a colleague," said the report, "Made in America." 
</P>
<P>
Taking only small or partial steps to improve the nation's competitiveness will 
doom the United States to steady slippage in the standard of living, according 
to the two-year study by scientists, engineers and economists from 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese and West German corporations invest far more than most U.S. firms in 
training and retraining workers over a lifetime. The payoff, said the study, is 
a work force prepared and flexible enough to adapt to changing styles and 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started From Scratch 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies that are doing well today often are ones that have started from 
scratch or come through crises, the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
They cited Xerox Corp., which fought back after losing most of the world copier 
market in the 1970s and early 1980s, and Ford Motor Co., which has rebounded to 
become the nation's most profitable auto maker after losing $3.3 billion from 
1980 through 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"The management trick is, can you change before you have a crisis?" said Lester 
Thurow, dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management. It can be done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Chaparral 
Industries Inc. do provide effective training, the report said. But many small 
and medium-sized companies feel they can't afford to establish extensive 
training programs. Or they are concerned that if they do, they'd lose their 
investment when workers transfer to other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Changing this "would require a kind of national political leadership that has 
not yet appeared," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neglect of Human Resources 
</P>
<P>
The study was produced by a 16-member MIT Commission on Industrial 
Productivity. 
</P>
<P>
The 344-page report's principal authors were Michael L. Dertouzos, professor of 
engineering and computer science, Richard K. Lester, associate professor of 
nuclear engineering, and Robert M. Solow, professor of economics and Nobel 
laureate in economics. 
</P>
<P>
Neglect of human resources may be the United States' biggest failing, Dertouzos 
said at a news conference on the report. 
</P>
<P>
Unless something is done, he said, "The nation will become progressively more 
impoverished in relative terms." 
</P>
<P>
While critical of U.S. public schools and vocational schools for turning out 
children ill-equipped in math, science and other disciplines, the report said 
school reform is only a first step toward a more productive work force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Job 
</P>
<P>
"Even if American schools were to be improved, there are reasons to believe 
that learning work skills on the job might be preferable to learning them in 
schools," the report argued. 
</P>
<P>
Skills developed on the job tend to be broader, more flexible and more relevant 
to the future needs of the corporation. Such skills are general enough so that 
they can be useful even if the worker switches jobs. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, for example, offers young workers apprenticeships in 400 
occupations. The apprentice, usually 16 years old, spends an average of three 
years working in a firm under a supervisor. The training curriculum is 
negotiated with government, employers' associations and trade unions. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, workers rotate between research, manufacturing, sales and other 
areas. They spend several days a year in corporate training centers and are 
also encouraged to take correspondence courses. 
</P>
<P>
The report disputed the notion that U.S. workers are being outdone by foreign 
competitors because of a decline in the work ethic.

MAN GIVEN MAXIMUM OF 10 YEARS IN KILLELEA DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young man who drove into a Newport Beach mother of three, killing her in an 
alley on Balboa Peninsula last Sept. 1, was sentenced to 10 years in prison 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas pronounced the sentence 
after hearing 2 hours of emotional testimony that included tearful courtroom 
statements from both the victim's husband and the driver, 19-year-old Danny 
David Ornelas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is with a heavy heart that I do this, Mr. Ornelas, but I must do what I 
must do," Cardenas said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Debbie Killelea, 37, had been involved in local community efforts 
to slow speeding traffic on the crowded Balboa Peninsula, and her violent death 
just before 
</P>
<P>
Labor Day weekend in an accident involving a drunken young man caused an 
uproar. 
</P>
<P>
The case later took a bizarre twist when it was learned that a passenger in 
Ornelas' car had recorded the accident on a video camera. The eerie tape showed 
Killelea trying to run out of the car's way as it bore down on her. Her two 
young sons are seen in the videotape watching in horror as the car nears their 
mother. They escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, who was found to be legally drunk at the time of the accident, has 
been in Orange County Jail since his March 20 jury conviction for gross 
vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Killelea, 40, the victim's husband, took the witness stand Tuesday 
morning to tell the judge how the tragedy had affected him and his three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Killelea did not testify during the 3-week trial in March. But the father said 
Tuesday that he wanted to be a witness to how drunk-driving, such as in 
Ornelas' case, can devastate the family of a victim. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a vindictive person; however, I represent the American family, and 
all I want is justice served," Killelea said. He broke into tears on the 
witness stand as he spoke about his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, of Huntington Park, who did not testify at the trial, also spoke for 
the first time in court Tuesday. The boyish-looking teen-ager, who was wearing 
an orange-colored County Jail jumpsuit, said that he was sorry for what 
happened, calling the death "tragic." Ornelas, who appeared to be weeping, said 
he would do everything he could to try to make up for the offense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Rejects Study 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas rejected a defense motion to have the matter studied by the state 
Department of Corrections before sentencing. The judge said he already had 
ample information. He had the option of giving Ornelas a 4-year, 6-year or 
10-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas appeared pale but stoic when the sentence was announced, but members of 
his family broke into tears and loud sobs. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals, later told reporters that 
he thought the sentence was fair. He said Ornelas must serve at least 5 years 
in state prison before being eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas' attorney, Ralph Bencangey of Beverly Hills, said he will appeal the 
sentence, the conviction, or possibly both. "I haven't decided, but I'll 
probably appeal the sentence rather than the conviction," Bencangey said in an 
interview. "It was an unfair sentence, but I think it's what the community 
wanted. After all, this is Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
In court, Bencangey argued that wide media coverage of the Ornelas case had 
unfairly prompted community pressure for a tough sentence. Had it not been for 
the unusual videotape, Bencangey said, the fatal accident would not have drawn 
such widespread attention and "never would have resulted in a murder charge 
against my client." 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas was charged with second-degree murder in Killelea's death, based on the 
allegation that he did not brake the speeding car, despite seeing Debbie 
Killelea and her two sons walking in the narrow alley. 
</P>
<P>
After 5 days of deliberation, the jury rejected murder and convicted Ornelas of 
gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. The jury at one point declared 
itself hopelessly deadlocked before finally reaching its verdict. Had Ornelas 
been convicted of second-degree murder, he could have been sentenced to up to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In court Tuesday, Bencangey pleaded with the judge for either probation or the 
minimum sentence for Ornelas. Goethals argued for the maximum penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is an all-American nightmare," Goethals said. "A mother, a pillar in 
the community, leaves her house and is killed as she walks near her home. . . . 
This case strikes a broad nerve in everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bencangey noted that Ornelas had no prior criminal record. The defense lawyer 
said the strong alcoholic beverages that Ornelas and two young companions were 
drinking at the beach on Sept. 1 were the root of the tragedy. The three men, 
according to testimony, had been drinking 151-proof rum and strong malt liquor 
during the day. Ornelas was found to have a 0.18 blood-alcohol level, which is 
almost twice the 0.10 level that state law mandates as proof of intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence in this case was that a very decent person did a very horrible 
thing in a few minutes that day," Bencangey said. Bencangey also claimed 
repeatedly that intense media coverage blew the case out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said he was not influenced by media coverage. "Whether the media takes 
an interest in a case is not a factor," he said. "The court sentences according 
to law and to the facts." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the severity of the crime was something that he could not 
overlook. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a life is extinguished, it is irretrievable," Cardenas said. "I think 
that is the factor in this case which highlights the catastrophic nature of 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered Ornelas to stand as he pronounced sentence. A female relative 
of the young man broke into hysterical sobs in the courtroom as the judge gave 
the maximum sentence. Ornelas' father and mother clasped each other and bowed 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Sentence Was Just 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Brian Killelea told reporters that he thought the 
judge's sentence was a just one. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel what the judge said truly hit home," Killelea said. "It doesn't need to 
be your second crime to be able to be punished to the maximum. A definite 
statement has to be sent to these young people." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Ornelas, the father of the convicted man, said outside of court that he 
was sad and disheartened. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a good work record, and my son has a good record," Ornelas said. 
"Something like this has never happened before to my family. Danny is not a 
criminal. He does not deserve jail."

CONVICTION OVERTURNED IN DISNEYLAND MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appeals court has overturned the second-degree murder conviction of a 
reputed gang member who fatally shot a rival gang member in a Disneyland 
parking lot in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana ruled that jurors who convicted 
Keleti Naea, 20, were not properly instructed about the lesser crime of 
involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors must give Naea a new murder trial or reduce his conviction to 
involuntary manslaughter, the justices said in the ruling issued this week. 
</P>
<P>
Naea was sentenced to 17 years to life in state prison last year after his 
conviction stemming from the March 17, 1987, shooting during a midnight gang 
clash in the Disneyland parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Salesi Tai, 15, a reputed member of a Compton street gang, was shot four times 
-- three in the back -- and later died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Naea contended that he thought the gun, which belonged to the victim, was a toy 
when he picked it off the ground and fired at Tai.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAGUNA HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
3 HELD ON KIDNAPING AND ROBBERY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Laguna Hills men were arrested Tuesday in connection with the kidnaping 
and robbery of a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, Gorgonio Acosta and Martin Velasco, both 21, and Rosendo Velasco, 
28, were being held in Orange County Jail in the Monday night kidnaping and 
robbery of a 17-year-old boy, who was abducted near a local video arcade, 
Sheriff's Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name was being withheld because he is a juvenile, told 
officers that he and some friends were playing games at a video arcade at Ridge 
Route Drive and Muirlands Boulevard when he went for some change about 9 p.m., 
Sheriff's Department Lt. Bob Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Three men "just saw him, went over and grabbed him and pulled him over to a 
vehicle and forced him in," Rivas alleged. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects took the boy's $40 and drove him around the south Orange County 
area for about 45 minutes, striking him several times in the face, Rivas said. 
When they stopped the car and threatened to throw the youth into a ditch, he 
managed to run away. 
</P>
<P>
The three men were arrested after the teen-ager provided investigators with a 
description of the suspects' car, Rivas said. Authorities were looking for a 
fourth man in connection with the incident but would not elaborate.

ANAHEIM TEACHERS TO VOTE ON 1-DAY STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of difficult contract talks, teachers in the financially troubled 
Anaheim Union High School District will vote Friday on whether to stage a 1-day 
strike next week to demonstrate their displeasure with the district's latest 
salary offer. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Lahtinen, president of the Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn., said talks 
with district representatives collapsed last week after a disagreement on 
salary increases for the next 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lahtinen said teachers could vote to accept the district's latest offer, which 
is far from what the association is proposing, or they could vote to walk out 
on May 10, which is also Teacher Appreciation Day. 
</P>
<P>
"One day is sufficient to indicate to the district that we're serious about 
rejecting their offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' contract expired last August and, Lahtinen said, talks officially 
reached an impasse in January. 
</P>
<P>
During negotiations, district officials have maintained that declines in 
enrollment since 1972 have left them unable to afford salary increases teachers 
have been requesting. 
</P>
<P>
That position was reiterated Monday in letters signed by the district's five 
trustees and the superintendent that were sent out to 900 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Whose fault is it that the district is in financial difficulty?" the letter 
asks. "It is no one's fault. Population growth and residence patterns are the 
root cause." 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy L. Kellogg, assistant superintendent for administrative services, said 
Tuesday that "in spite of our best efforts, our fixed costs continue to erode 
the district's revenue reserves." 
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, each student lost translates into a loss of about 
$3,200 a year for the district. During the 1987-88 school year, that meant the 
district operated with a $4.8-million deficit, and a deficit of $1.5 million is 
projected for the 1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The district's latest salary offer would hold teacher salaries in the next 
school year to the same proportion they now represent of the total budget, 
after a reserve fund of 2.5% is set aside. Anything left over would be given as 
a salary increase up to a maximum of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, any increase would come after a 3% reserve fund was set aside, 
with a cap at 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, on the other hand, are seeking a guaranteed salary increase for this 
year of about 3.2%, which corresponds to the inflation rate, plus 41% of what 
is left after a 2.5% reserve is set aside for the district. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives rejected the district's proposal, Lahtinen said, because 
there are no guarantees any money will be left over for salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
"The result could be no salary increase for two years in a row," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said the district hopes teachers will not go out on strike, but said if 
they do, school will not close down. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan on keeping the schools open," Kellogg said. "We plan on providing an 
educational program for the kids."

ATTORNEYS BILL COUNTY FOR $307,982 FOR LAWSUIT THAT SHERIFF GATES LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys who won a civil rights lawsuit against Sheriff Brad Gates have 
submitted the bill for their services -- $307,982.50 -- and under federal law, 
the county must pay. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers representing the county say the amount is "outrageous." The 
attorneys' fees, plus about $13,000 in court costs, amount to about 70% more 
than the jury awarded the attorneys' client. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the fees they're asking for are not supportable, and we're going to 
challenge them," said Janine K. Jeffery of Los Angeles, one of the attorneys 
who defended Gates and the county. 
</P>
<P>
The fees were specified in a motion filed by attorneys Michael J. Cisarik of 
Santa Ana and Meir J. Westreich of Glendale, who represented private 
investigator Preston Guillory. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory's suit was filed in 1985 and alleged that Gates used his investigators 
and influence to arrange for prosecution of Guillory on charges of 
impersonating an officer and illegally carrying a concealed weapon. Guillory 
was acquitted of all charges in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Gates wanted to discredit Guillory, who had filed a 
previous suit against Gates, charging that Gates handed out concealed weapon 
permits as rewards to friends and campaign contributors. That suit is still 
pending is federal court and is scheduled for trial later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last March 15, after 4 years of trial preparation and 6 weeks of trial, a 
six-member jury awarded Guillory $144,894 for actual losses, such as lost 
wages, and $45,000 for suffering. Under federal law, if a plaintiff wins a 
civil rights suit, the loser is obligated to pay reasonable plaintiff's 
attorney fees and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
In their motion filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Cisarik declared 
that he worked 1,143.9 hours on Guillory's suit and Westreich declared that he 
worked 616 hours. Both billed their time at $175 per hour, bringing the 
attorneys' fees to $200,182.50 for Cisarik and $107,800 for Westreich. 
</P>
<P>
Added to the fees are about $13,000 for such costs as taking depositions, 
serving subpoenas and transporting witnesses to Los Angeles, where the trial 
was held. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the motion has been scheduled May 22 before U.S. District Judge 
Richard A. Gadbois Jr., who presided over the trial and has discretion in 
deciding how much Guillory's attorneys will be paid.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: STOP TINKERING WITH BASEBALL'S SUBTLETIES -- REPEAL DH RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pox on 1976, the year the National Federation of State High School Assns. 
said yes to the designated hitter. I still get queasy thinking about it: one 
one-dimensional player after another stepping up to the plate to swing a bat. 
Nothing else. No throwing skills required. No fielding necessary. You don't 
even need a mitt -- just a batting glove. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about your tools of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it bad enough when the NFSHSA (whew!) approved the use of metal bats in 
1974, forever inflating batting averages and egos everywhere, as well as 
ruining some perfectly good dugout chatter? After all, who wants to hear, "He's 
off at the clang of the bat," or, "Attaboy, Eddie, way to get good aluminum on 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
But the bureaucrats weren't satisfied; tinkering with the game's subtleties 
gave them something to do. Two years later, they introduced the DH to the 
nation's high schools and the rest, as they say, is depressing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's one of our more popular rules in high school baseball," said Brad 
Rumble, assistant director of the NFSHSA. "The intent is to get more people in 
the game. A lot of times in high school baseball, the best players get to play. 
This created another chance for players." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine that -- the best players get to play. What an awful idea. 
</P>
<P>
But with the DH, you don't have to be among the best. In fact, you don't even 
have to try to be among the best. Learn how to turn the double play? What's the 
point? Learn the proper cutoff men? Maybe later. Figure out how to charge a 
ball? Uh, perhaps after a turn in the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
The DH comes with its own safety net: It is easily defended. It is well-liked. 
It seemingly has no faults. 
</P>
<P>
Rumble, like those coaches in favor of the designated hitter, says the whole 
point of the rule is to "create as many opportunities as possible for the kids 
to participate. We are coming from a level different (than the major leagues). 
Our philosophy has been to give the kid a chance. It should be for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, I'm all for fun. And nothing wrong with a little participation too. The 
problem is that the DH has one itsy, bitsy inherent problem: It cheapens the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, what's the advantage of including another player -- 
one-dimensional, at that -- when it means sacrificing a certain amount of 
strategy? And why is hitting so important? Why can't there be a designated 
shortstop? Or center fielder? Or catcher? If you really want to include more 
players, why limit it to a lug who can clang away? Put a premium on the other 
parts of the game too. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Boone, the former Angel catcher, was fond of saying that a manager wouldn't 
win you many games, but then again, he sure could lose some for you. With the 
DH -- on all levels (pro, college or high school) -- a manager's role is 
diminished. Coaches don't have to coach as much. Players don't have to play as 
much. The DH alleviates the art of second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
Should a coach pinch-hit for his team's worst hitter? 
</P>
<P>
Should a coach let his worst hitter hit away or bunt? 
</P>
<P>
What happens if his best fielder is also his worst hitter? Then what? 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. The DH takes a lot of the guessing (and second-guessing) out of 
the game, which is too bad, because that's what makes baseball so interesting 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
I love baseball, but I think I respect the other sports more. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: 
</P>
<P>
You play your best five in high school basketball and take your chances. You 
substitute on occasion, but every change is considered a calculated risk. 
</P>
<P>
You play your best five in tennis and golf, but with the understanding that a 
player can challenge another player for his place on the team. 
</P>
<P>
You field your best track or swim team by what the second hand says. But times 
can change, can't they? 
</P>
<P>
You choose your football starters by what they do on the practice field, which 
seems fair. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, don't tell the NFSHSA this. Before you'd know it, there would be 
designated free-throwers in basketball, designated servers in tennis and 
designated putters in golf. Decathletes could skip an event and use their, say, 
designated pole vaulter to clear 16 feet. The same goes for a swimmer, who 
could call on a designated freestyler to finish the final leg of the individual 
medley. Wide receivers could make remarkable catches and then have their 
designated runners complete the rest of the play. 
</P>
<P>
I've had it with specialization. I'll take the high school player who hits 
.250, owns a mitt and a position over the guy who thinks pine tar and a .330 
batting average is the same thing as knowing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
And one final suggestion about the DH to the good folks at the NFSHSA: 
</P>
<P>
It's not too late to change.

KENNEDY HIGH'S FRANCO LIVES TO HIT; 
</P>
<P>
HE PACKS HIS BAT TO CLASS AND BACK HOME FOR THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kennedy High School's Ernie Franco doesn't mind sitting on the bench for most 
of seven innings, getting only three or four at-bats as the designated hitter. 
It means he gets to hit. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't mind catching seven innings either, because he knows he gets to hit 
too. 
</P>
<P>
He likes going to practice; he knows he gets to work on his hitting. 
</P>
<P>
After practice, as all the other bats are put in a sack and locked away for the 
night, Franco's goes home with him . . . so he can hit at the batting cages. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Ernie Franco gets to take his swings, he's happy. 
</P>
<P>
"He stays out there for as long as he can and takes batting practice," said his 
coach, Chris Pascal. "He loves to swing the bat. Sometimes I'll be coaching 
third, and I'll hear someone mumbling in the dugout. It will be Ernie, talking 
to himself about hitting." 
</P>
<P>
While most other students tote a book bag to class each morning, Franco has a 
bag with his bat in it too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my strong point," Franco said about hitting. "Whenever I have time, I'm 
always hitting. I like having my bat with me. It's like part of me." 
</P>
<P>
Franco is hitting .368 with five home runs and 30 runs batted in. He's hitting 
.433 in Garden Grove League games for first-place Kennedy (18-4 overall and 9-1 
in league play) with four regular-season games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
As strong as his numbers are, they are still short of the goals he set for 
himself and wrote inside the bill of his cap at the start of the season. Franco 
wants to hit .400 with 10 home runs and 40 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I may fall a little short of my goals," said Franco, a senior. "But as long as 
the team does well, then it will be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Franco's 30 RBIs this season give him a Kennedy career record of 57. His five 
home runs leave him one short of the school's single-season record of six set 
by Alan Bannister in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
But is he satisfied? 
</P>
<P>
"He comes to me the other day and asks me what he's doing wrong," Pascal said. 
"He puts that kind of pressure on himself. He is really pressing, maybe too 
much, to do well at the plate every time." 
</P>
<P>
Franco, a left-handed hitter who is 6-feet-2 and 225 pounds, played mostly as 
the designated hitter as a sophomore, his first season on the varsity. He hit 
only about .200 that first season. 
</P>
<P>
The summer before his junior season, he injured his left knee in a 
summer-league baseball game and was bothered by the injury throughout football 
season. He was a lineman. 
</P>
<P>
The sore knee forced him into the role of the designated hitter at the start of 
his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks into the season, he got mononucleosis and missed three weeks. When he 
came back, he was limited to playing only as the designated hitter because he 
was still weak from the illness. 
</P>
<P>
Franco excelled, hitting .400 in league games and .340 overall. He was voted 
the Garden Grove League's first-team designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Franco started as a lineman in all of Kennedy's football games last fall and 
has remained injury free this season in baseball. He started the season as the 
designated hitter, but when catcher Scott Wood injured his knee in practice 
three weeks ago, Franco became the starting catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He works very hard on his defense too," Pascal said. "He's out there 
practicing on blocking pitches in the dirt. I demand a lot out of my catcher. 
They have to call all the pitches. Catching takes something away from a 
player's hitting because it takes so much concentration, but Ernie has been 
able to adjust pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Because he knows it means he will get a chance to hit.

WESTMINSTER BLANKS OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A dominating performance by pitcher Brett Grebe helped Westminster remain in a 
tie for first place in the Sunset League as the Lions defeated Ocean View, 3-0, 
Tuesday at Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster (16-6-1, 8-4), which began the day tied with Ocean View and 
Fountain Valley, is now tied with Fountain Valley for first place. Westminster 
plays Fountain Valley Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Grebe came into the game with the third highest number of strikeouts (77) among 
county pitchers. He added six while giving up two hits and walking two. 
</P>
<P>
He threw only 97 pitches, the fewest number of pitches he has thrown for seven 
innings, Westminster Coach Ken Ostrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just overpowering. He had the good stuff," Ostrowski said. "He was 
strong. He felt good. He was on, and the rest, as they say, is history." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster scored in the third inning. Jim Slagle singled, then stole second 
before first baseman Ryan Klesko singled down the third-base line to score 
Slagle and put the Lions up, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Lion third baseman Joe Tiano led off the fifth with a double. Brent Heredia 
laid down a sacrifice bunt, to Ocean View pitcher Brent Woken, but Woken's 
throw went over the first baseman's head. 
</P>
<P>
Tiano scored from first on the error to make it 2-0, with Heredia reaching 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Lopez's ground ball up the middle scored Heredia for the final run of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 3, Edison 2 -- Mark Dodd walked with the bases loaded in the 
bottom of the seventh inning to give host Fountain Valley (15-7, 8-4), which 
scored three runs in the inning, the come-from-behind victory. Edison pitcher 
Rick Alvarez had walked the first three batters of the inning, before Don Smith 
took over and gave up one run on a groundout and the tying run on a squeeze 
bunt by John Orcher. Jeff Daniels then relieved and walked Dodd on five 
pitches. Steve Montgomery went the distance for Fountain Valley, giving up two 
unearned runs on five hits while striking out 12 and walking one. Edison drops 
to 7-10-2 overall and 5-7 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Marina 4, Huntington Beach 2 -- Robin Lindsey had two hits and two RBIs for the 
Vikings (11-12, 4-8) at Marina.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
MAY BOWL IS NOT-SO-SERIOUS BUSINESS TO THESE TITAN COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Texas, the old joke goes, they have two major sports -- football and spring 
football. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Fullerton, they have their own classifications for the same games 
-- football and slapstick football. 
</P>
<P>
The intent, of course, is that all the slapstick should come in the spring, and 
for the most part it does, thanks to the now-traditional coaches of the spring 
intrasquad game known as the May Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the spirit of the game, consider one of its standing rules: 
"Unethical trick plays meant to deceive the opposition are legal. Blatant 
cheating is not permitted unless you can get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly, Lloyd and Hatter are alternately co-conspirators in various scams 
and plotters against each other. One is "Gasoline" to the other's "Matches," as 
sports information director Mel Franks put it. 
</P>
<P>
Inwardly, they are among the best-informed on the inner workings of the 
athletic department, plus they daily perform two of its most basic but crucial 
duties. What would a team be without clean uniforms and well-taped ankles? 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gene Murphy turned over the May Bowl coaching to Lloyd and Hatter in 
1987, making the game their moment under the lights. 
</P>
<P>
The focus this year is on Hatter's rather odd tactics. After losing the first 
two games to Lloyd's Boys, 21-17 and 17-7, the Mad Hatters are taking a 
decidedly low-key approach to Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"Overconfidence on their side is part of our game plan," Hatter said. 
</P>
<P>
Given the option of a coin toss to decide who would choose first between the 
two supposedly even teams divided by the football staff, Hatter demurred, 
suggesting Lloyd take first choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, maybe he felt he'd let me outsmart myself," Lloyd said. "Maybe I 
did, but I took the best team." 
</P>
<P>
That's rather clear. The Lloyd's Boys roster includes returning quarterback Dan 
Speltz, who threw for 1,924 yards last season, and his favorite target, 
receiver Rocky Palamara. Leading rusher Mike Pringle also is on the team, as 
well as defensive standouts Mike Schaffel (safety) and Chris Wright (outside 
linebacker). 
</P>
<P>
Hatter's team counters with backup quarterback Paul Schulte, a redshirt last 
year whom Murphy says had a fine spring, plus three-year letterman fullback Tim 
Byrnes, receivers Tony Dill and Mark Hill and outside linebacker Harold Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Hatter says the pressure is all on Lloyd, and that's the way he likes it. 
</P>
<P>
"By all rights, if they don't win by five touchdowns, they should be very 
disappointed," Hatter said. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the spirit around campus the past year or so, Hatter says he is 
emphasizing academics this year. With three days to whip his team into shape, 
Hatter says he might give the players Friday off "so they can go to all their 
classes and study." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, to whom academics is likewise important, is wary of such talk. Will 
Lloyd's Boys be off on Friday in order to do some extra studying? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," Lloyd said. "As far as I know, Cliff's team could go down to 
a park and work out. We're going to stay within ourselves and prepare as we 
always do." 
</P>
<P>
Hatter thinks there's a good chance that Lloyd will spend Friday installing an 
illegal play -- illegal, that is, under the standard rules of football. 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK," Hatter said. "That's the kind of person he is. He'll stoop to any 
level to win. Basically that's because he's an insecure person and has an ego 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd refuses to be suckered in by Hatter's approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I still know Cliff well enough to know how competitive he is," Lloyd said. "He 
may give that old song and dance about just being happy to be here. But you 
know when game time comes, he'll be fired up." 
</P>
<P>
May Bowl IV begins at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Fullerton High School District 
Stadium. All tickets are $5 general admission. 
</P>
<P>
Two returning senior lettermen, quarterback Carlos Siragusa and receiver Carlos 
Ward, have left the team in the face of limited playing time, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Tousley, a 5-foot-10 forward from Mesa High School in Mesa, Ariz., has 
signed a national letter of intent to play women's basketball at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Tousley, who averaged 13 points and nine rebounds a game at Mesa this season, 
is the fifth player to sign with the Titans for next school year. Aggie Garcia 
and Cheryl Hightower, both of Reseda, Heidi James of Mesa and Stacy Oughton of 
West Covina signed with Fullerton in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so happy to get (Tousley) in our program here at Cal State Fullerton 
because she will add class and fill the gap at our big forward position," 
Fullerton Coach Maryalyce Jeremiah said. "Tracy is very smart and has a 
respectable work ethic. Her rebounding skills are outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton women finished with a 21-9 record last season, qualifying for the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament for the first time in the 
program's history. The Titans lost to Montana in the first round.

CYPRESS CLIMBS INTO FIRST-PLACE TIE

The Cypress College baseball team started Tuesday thinking it was playing to 
hold on to second place. The Chargers appeared to do that with an 9-4 victory 
over Golden West in an Orange Empire game at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the news that last-place Riverside had upset Rancho Santiago, 5-2, 
putting Cypress back into a first-place tie with the Dons with two games left 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't worry about what anyone else is doing," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler 
said. "We still have two tough games left and that is what we have to focus 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitcher Jeff Patterson (8-3) allowed seven hits and no runs over seven 
innings and Cypress used seven consecutive hits in the fourth inning to score 
six runs and take an 8-0 lead. Patterson, who also pitches in relief, was taken 
out in case he is needed again this week. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Kaylor opened the game with a double and scored on a single by Doug Yates 
as Cypress took a 1-0 lead in the first. Terry Tewell hit his sixth home run in 
the second to give Cypress (29-13, 15-7) a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Gregory opened the fourth with a single for Cypress. Ken Kendrena then 
singled and Joey Gonzales had an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scott had an RBI single, and Golden West starter John Gonzales was 
replaced by Todd Long. 
</P>
<P>
Long gave up RBI singles to Tewell and Kaylor and an RBI double to Steve Gill. 
Jason Friedman then grounded back to Long, who threw to the plate, but Kaylor 
knocked the ball loose from Golden West catcher Dan Villegas to score the final 
run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress scored on an RBI double by Bobby Thome in the fifth to take a 9-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Robb Carabba had a two-run single and Jeff Repoz had a two-run double for 
Golden West (19-14, 13-9) in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago plays host to Golden West Thursday and is at Saddleback 
Saturday. Cypress plays at Saddleback Thursday and plays host to Fullerton 
Saturday in the final conference games. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the conference gets an automatic berth into the Southern 
California Regional playoffs, which start May 19. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire games: 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 5, Rancho Santiago 2 -- For the second time this season Riverside 
(7-25-1, 4-18-1) upset Rancho Santiago (26-14, 15-7) in Riverside. Jack Bailey 
(10-4) took the loss but had six strikeouts to set both the single-season and 
career strikeout record for Rancho Santiago. Bailey has 97 this season and 159 
in his career. Riverside scored twice in the eighth to take a 5-1 lead. Tim 
Reynolds doubled to open Rancho Santiago's ninth inning but Conrad Colby struck 
out. John McTaggart was hit by a pitch, then he and Reynolds worked a double 
steal. Sean Ramos hit a sacrifice fly and then Marty Neff popped out to end the 
game. Mike Garcia (2-11) got the victory for Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 9, Saddleback 0 -- Ryan Thibault (9-1) pitched a five-hit shutout,

Disease Detection International Inc. said it has received U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration approval to market blood tests that can measure the presence of 
antibodies to viruses that cause rubella, herpes, cytomegalvirus or toxoplasma 
within 7 minutes in a doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Current tests, which typically are conducted in clinical laboratories, require 
blood samples to be diluted and take several hours to complete, the Irvine 
diagnostics company said. 
</P>
<P>
The tests, called SeroCard tests, use plastic cards embedded with membranes on 
which doctors place a drop of blood from a patient's finger. DDI President H. 
Thad Morris said the appearance of a blue spot on the card indicates a positive 
test. 
</P>
<P>
A positive test means that antibodies to the viruses are present in the 
bloodstream and that the patient has developed an immunity to further 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the tests are most often conducted to determine if pregnant 
women are susceptible to the viral infections, which can cause birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Rubella, also known as German measles, causes enlargement of lymph nodes in the 
neck and a rash. Herpes is a skin inflammation characterized by small blisters. 
Cytomegalvirus is a disease involving abnormal cell enlargement. Toxoplasma is 
a parasitic organism sometimes found in uncooked pork products. 
</P>
<P>
DDI said it has developed a similar 7-minute physician-conducted test to detect 
the presence of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which 
causes AIDS. A positive HIV test indicates the presence of antibodies, however 
the antibodies have not successfully fought the virus. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that later this year it will seek FDA formal clinical approval 
for the HIV test. 
</P>
<P>
The HIV test was developed jointly with Ferring Pharmaceuticals in Sweden. DDI 
said that, so far, it has tested more than 2,000 clinical specimens using the 
SeroCard. And it is selling the test for research and investigative use by 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the company expects to receive Swedish regulatory approval to 
market the product later this spring. If U.S. approval is not received, he 
said, Ferring will begin production in Sweden, and DDI will seek marketing 
approval in other European countries and in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the FDA has told him there are "many questions that must be 
answered" before approval will be granted.

HEAD OF DEFUNCT RAMONA SAVINGS WILL BE FREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John L. Molinaro, the former head of the defunct Ramona Savings &amp; Loan in 
Orange who has been jailed for nearly 2 years, has been deemed eligible for 
parole and could be released from prison this week. 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro, 48, is being held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles on 
charges including bank fraud and conspiracy in connection with the collapse of 
Ramona, which was taken over by regulators in September, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal trial based on those charges is scheduled to begin May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon ordered Molinaro be held without 
bail after prosecutors argued he might flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro was convicted in 1987 of passport fraud after he tried to leave the 
United States by applying for a passport under the name of a Santa Clara man 
who had been dead for 30 years. Incarcerated since July 22, 1987, Molinaro has 
completed his sentence for passport fraud, but has remained in custody because 
of Kenyon's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his application for a passport, Molinaro was carrying $400,000 
in cash and jewelry along with a loaded gun. Federal prosecutors have alleged 
that Molinaro stashed $3 million in a bank in the Cayman Islands and that he 
was trying to get out of the country in order to retrieve that money. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco 
overturned Kenyon's refusal to set bail. On Friday, Kenyon complied with the 
higher court's decision and ordered Molinaro set free if he posted a $250,000 
bond and agreed to surrender all passports. Molinaro is also restricted from 
traveling outside of Southern California and must spend at least 30 days at a 
halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald V. Scotti, Molinaro's attorney, said he expects his client to be 
released by Friday.

ALLERGAN NAMES BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS SPINOFF FROM SMITHKLINE NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Allergan Inc. won't be spun off from its parent SmithKline Beckman Corp. until 
this summer, but the Irvine eye- and skin-care product company has already 
named its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline, a Philadelphia pharmaceutical giant, plans to distribute shares in 
its Allergan and Beckman Instruments Inc. subsidiaries to SmithKline 
stockholders before SmithKline merges most of its operations with the British 
firm Beecham PLC. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton-based Beckman created its board last year when SmithKline spun off 
14% of Beckman's stock to public investors. But Allergan remained a wholly 
owned subsidiary, so it had no board of directors until now. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Allergan's nine-member board: 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Gavin S. Herbert Jr., who joined Allergan in 1955, seven years after 
his father founded the company. Herbert is also a director of SmithKline 
Beckman and Beckman Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
William C. Shepherd, Allergan president since 1984. He joined the company in 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Flamson III, chairman of Security Pacific National Bank. His other 
directorships include Northrop Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Grant, chairman of New York Life International Investment Inc. He is 
also a director of SmithKline Beckman and Irvine-based Fluor Corp., and he is a 
general partner of Amster &amp; Co., a risk arbitrage firm. 
</P>
<P>
Harry C. Groome III, president of SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratories, another 
SmithKline subsidiary. He joined SmithKline in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth N. Kermes, executive vice president of corporate finance for 
SmithKline. He is a director of Beckman Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Handel E. Evans, executive chairman of Walsh International, a supplier of 
information services to the health care industry. He is also a director of 
SmithKline. 
</P>
<P>
Louis T. Rosso, president of Beckman Instruments. 
</P>

Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beckman. He is also a member of the board 
of Atlantic Richfield Co.

TAKING AN INDEPENDENT PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For some time, independent film companies have been frustrated by the vast 
reservoirs of untapped movie audiences who will take a chance only on a film 
accompanied by the reassurance of heavy advertising, extensive promotional 
campaigns and a lot of hype. 
</P>
<P>
In "Scandal," which averaged almost $7,000 per screen on its opening weekend 
last week, Harvey and Bob Weinstein, co-chairmen of independent Miramax Films, 
have dared to tread in a land inhabited mostly by studio giants. 
</P>
<P>
To get there, the Weinsteins applied the seat-of-the-pants techniques they 
learned from promoting concerts in Buffalo, N.Y., by barroom rockers such as 
Lynyrd Skynyrd to marketing art-house films by the likes of Claude Lelouch. 
</P>
<P>
"Marketing is not a dirty word," said Harvey, 34, in a conference call from New 
York with his 37-year-old brother. "Although we market artistic films, we don't 
use the starving-artist mentality in our releases. Other distributors slap out 
a movie, put an ad in the newspaper -- usually not a very good one -- and hope 
that the audience will find it by miracle. And most often they don't. It's the 
distributor's responsibility to find the audience." 
</P>
<P>
There's a basic element to the two Bronx natives that places them more 
naturally in a recliner with beer nuts cheering for their hometown Yankees than 
jetting to the South of France to purchase avant-garde art films at Cannes. Yet 
the brothers are relentless in their pursuit of quality films. From polling 
audiences for marketing ideas to writing ad copy, there is no facet of 
operations over which they do not maintain tight control. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one part of our organization we're never going to delegate," said Bob, 
who is the businessman of the two; Harvey is the fast-talking negotiator. 
"Using a baseball analogy, we're player-managers. We don't want to be managers. 
There's no fun in it for us if we're not involved in the day-to-day 
</P>
<P>
activities." 
</P>
<P>
"Our staff calls us Israeli generals," Harvey added, "because in the Israeli 
armies the generals go out in front and are often the first casualties." 
</P>
<P>
The Weinsteins, who have turned a profit with more than 100 offbeat films 
including "I've Heard the Mermaids Singing," "Aria," "The Thin Blue Line" and 
"Pelle the Conqueror," have found their broadest audience yet with "Scandal" -- 
produced by Miramax and Palace Pictures in London -- about Christine Keeler's 
affair with British defense minister John Profumo that toppled the British 
government in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
When the film received an X rating last month from the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America for a sexually explicit orgy scene, the Weinsteins hired prominent 
First Amendment attorney Martin Garbus to appeal the narrow 8-7 decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys run from the controversy, we run toward it," Bob said, and then 
paused before clarifying: "We don't seek controversy -- we have enough problems 
with theater chains -- but if we feel the cause is just, we'll meet it head 
on." 
</P>
<P>
The Weinsteins lost the mock courtroom battle, which Harvey likened to the 
famed Scopes trial, and re-edited the controversial sequence for an R rating. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat was a minor setback; the avalanche of publicity ignited by the 
controversy has catapulted "Scandal" into the national spotlight. The film is 
booked in 94 theaters nationwide, including several major theater chains -- a 
first according to a Miramax spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
"Scandal" print advertisements feature a nude Joanne Whalley-Kilmer as Keeler 
draped seductively and strategically over a black chair. Last month, Miramax 
flew the real Keeler in from London to do the TV talk-show circuit to promote 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
While some laud Miramax's promotional antics, others feel the Weinsteins' raw 
treatment of sensitive and artistic films is harmful to the independent film 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
John Pierson, a producer's representative in New York who finds distributors 
for independent film producers, contracted with the Weinsteins two years ago to 
distribute Lizzie Borden's "Working Girls," a gritty, businesslike look at life 
in a Manhattan bordello. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing but respect for Harvey's sense of daring, adventure and 
willingness to walk a fine line in terms of finding what's exploitable in a 
film," Pierson said. " 'Working Girls' is a fantastic illustration of that. He 
found just the right touch. . . . The campaign was a model of how to be 
intelligent and sleazy at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
But when Pierson commissioned an independent audit of Miramax's handling of 
"Working Girls" -- a fairly common practice that producers have the right to 
exercise once a year -- he found distribution charges he claims were unrelated 
to the film. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate, but a lot of their competitors in the specialized film field 
would like to be able to dismiss them as a pair of crooked, former 
rock-and-roll bookers from Buffalo, New York," Pierson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Weinsteins began promoting concerts in 1972, when they belonged to a 
student council at the University of Buffalo that had booked Stephen Stills. 
When school funding suddenly came up short, they borrowed a friend's wedding 
gift of $2,500 and some money from a local pizza hangout and produced the 
concert themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey took out a loan and bought the Century Theater, a dilapidated, 
3,000-seat movie house in downtown Buffalo. They renovated it and spent the 
next five years booking national tours with artists such as Genesis, Billy Joel 
and the Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
"To pay for the heating bills we needed another source of income," Bob said. "I 
went downstairs and found some broken-down, unused film projectors. We 
refurbished the projectors and started to run film festivals on Friday and 
Saturday nights. Two thousand kids would show up and live at the theater on 
weekends." 
</P>
<P>
The Weinsteins formed Miramax (from their parents' names: Miriam and Max) in 
1979 and took turns conducting city-to-city campaigns for a Genesis concert 
movie. Tom Sherak, president of domestic distribution and marketing for 20th 
Century Fox, was with General Cinema when first approached by the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"They were these two young guys who wanted in the worst way to get their movies 
out and run midnight shows," Sherak said. "Normally when you pick up a midnight 
show from a major, they ship you a print, you take out a newspaper or radio ad 
and then you send it back. But Harvey and Bob did it all, and they genuinely 
cared about their films." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers' break came in 1982 when they purchased a film of a live benefit 
concert for Amnesty International featuring Monty Python comedy bits and music 
by several rock performers. There wasn't enough footage for a feature film, so 
they bought a second film of the concert tour and edited the two into "The 
Secret Policeman's Other Ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Weinsteins received sprinkles from the impending storm of controversy that 
would stay with them when their TV commercial for the film, in which Monty 
Python trooper Graham Chapman satirized the Moral Majority, was banned by NBC. 
Still, hard-core Python fans would not be denied, and the film grossed more 
than $6 million at the box office, more than any other Miramax film to date 
(most independent features gross well under $2 million). 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a surge in independent productions resulted in what one insider 
described as a "next batter up" syndrome -- too impatient to milk slow-starting 
independent features for profit, theater owners sent the next film in line up 
to the plate and hoped for a hit. 
</P>
<P>
To worsen matters, video retailers passed over smaller films with limited 
releases in favor of well-known, heavily endorsed commodities from the studios, 
cutting into the profits independents rely on to make up for a poor box-office 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
While competitors such as the Cannon Group, Island Pictures and Cinecom 
Entertainment Group struggled to maintain a foothold in the burgeoning market 
last year, Miramax confidently stepped forward with two releases the other 
distributors had balked on: "The Thin Blue Line," a stylized documentary that 
helped release a convicted murderer last month after 13 years in prison, and 
"Pelle the Conqueror," which won top honors at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival 
and an Oscar as best foreign-language picture at the 1989 Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the industry told us we were crazy at first," Harvey said. "They 
said nobody would pay money to see 'The Thin Blue Line' because it was a 
documentary, or 'Pelle the Conqueror' because it was 2 1/2 hours long and 
depressing." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Miramax is one of a few independents holding strong -- and perhaps the 
only one to show consistent growth -- in a field where a company's life 
expectancy is as long as its most recent box-office receipt. Miramax currently 
has a solid release schedule that includes several co-productions and the 
recent acquisition of domestic theatrical rights to the highly sought-after 
psychological drama "Sex, Lies and Videotape" for $1.1 million plus a 
commitment to spend $1 million in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"We chose Miramax as our distributor based upon Harvey's bid, his marketing 
plan and the level of enthusiasm he showed for the film," said producer Bobby 
Newmyre of Outlaw Productions in Studio City. "He came in and showed a religion 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
"We look at ourselves as a Rolls-Royce dealership," Harvey said. "We'll sell a 
few good cars a year and take care of them, as opposed to General Motors who 
will put out a million cars and not worry if they break down."

PARALLEL FEATURE AND TV PROJECTS ARRIVE AT ALMOST THE SAME TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On Friday, Orion will release "Lost Angels," a film about a teen-age boy 
wrongly placed in a psychiatric hospital by his fully insured, oblivious 
parents. Nine days later, CBS will broadcast "Out on the Edge," a TV movie 
about another boy who finds himself in exactly the same position. 
</P>
<P>
Producers of the film and the TV movie say the nearly simultaneous appearance 
of two nearly identical dramas is completely coincidental. They recount 
different starting points and separate development histories of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
Muckraking zeal motivated the TV producer, Steve Tisch, who set his project in 
motion after seeing a news show segment on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Personal identification with troubled teens spurred "Lost Angels" co-producer 
Howard Rosenman, who commissioned a script after reading an article about the 
problem in the L.A. Weekly and seeing a film treatment touching on the issue. 
"I'd been counseling runaways in New York, and that started me thinking," 
Rosenman says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the independent development of the two projects, their coincidental 
arrival highlights the increasing competitiveness among film makers and TV 
producers for up-to-the-minute source material. 
</P>
<P>
Analogs to the "Lost Angels"-"Out on the Edge" synchronism in this decade 
include the Frances Farmer bio-pics that appeared two months apart in 1982 and 
1983, "Frances" in theatres and "Will 
</P>
<P>
There Really Be a Morning?" on TV. There were also two Dorothy Stratten 
treatments, "Death of a Centerfold" on TV and "Star 80" in theatres, seen less 
than two years apart in 1981 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Another recent example of parallel thinking by TV and film producers was HBO's 
TV movie about minor-league baseball, "Long Gone," which aired in 1987, a few 
months before Orion started shooting "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
In such instances, accusations of copycattism may be heard, but industry 
decision-makers generally deflect such criticism by saying that similar 
antennae pick up similar signals. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the producers were getting signals about parents turning 
teen-agers over to special-care facilities whose financial motivations don't 
necessarily coincide with the child's best interest. 
</P>

"We're seeing today a breakdown in society," "Lost Angels" co-producer Thomas 
Baer says, "where the traditional values of parenting are being supplanted by 
economic motives, while our leaders are saying 'everything is terrific; this is 
a great country.' " 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989," says "Out on the Edge" producer Tisch, "it's naive to think there's 
not a high school in America where students aren't exposed to drugs. Parents 
who can't communicate with their kids can get scared by the TV ads for these 
profit-making institutions that say, 'If you can't deal with your child, we 
can.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the TV movie, Rick Schroder plays a boy who can't get along with his 
divorced mother's new romantic interest and feels abandoned by his father. 
Schroder's angry rebellion takes fairly mild forms, but his mother, urged on by 
her boyfriend, agrees to commit him. Insurance will cover most of the cost. The 
boy has no real psychiatric problem, but he is detained against his will, his 
only allies being an understanding therapist and another patient who becomes 
his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
In "Lost Angels," Beastie Boy leader Adam Horovitz makes his film debut as a 
boy whose recently remarried mother is too distracted to understand him and 
whose father is too angry to care. Horovitz gets involved with a gang headed by 
his violent half-brother and is jailed while his mother is away on her 
honeymoon. She returns and commits him. She, too, is insured. The boy attempts 
escape but is caught. The only bright spots are an understanding therapist 
(Donald Sutherland) and another patient who becomes his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Horovitz says of his character: "It's not like he's crazy, he just doesn't know 
what he wants to do. He's looking for something." Schroder says of his 
character: "He's a good kid in bad circumstances. His problems are no worse 
than what I've had in my life, but he doesn't have parents who take time to sit 
and talk and tell him they're behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Both productions take dead aim at laws and medical practices that are "just as 
likely to solidify anti-social qualities as to improve kids' behavior," as Baer 
puts it. 
</P>
<P>
Both producers dismiss the suggestion that the films' simultaneous appearances 
will hurt each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried," Rosenman says. "TV is TV." 
</P>
<P>
Tisch, whose TV credits include "The Burning Bed," says: "I think TV movies can 
be pretty important. The audience is much bigger, and if delivering a message 
is part of your intention, TV is a better way."

It's time to relieve the frustration, to release the aggression. It's time to 
complain, to revolt, to snarl, to cry foul, to spit out venom. Once again, it's 
time for that arena of protest like no other. 
</P>
<P>
The Gripe Line. 
</P>
<P>
Promos for movies or miniseries you are about to see. These are far worse than 
movie trailers. Designed to draw viewers to the tent, they immediately precede 
the production and inevitably ruin it for you by telling too much and blowing 
key scenes. 
</P>
<P>
It's like hearing the punch line before you've heard the joke. 
</P>
<P>
TV's brutalization of theatrical movies. No, not colorization, but the butchery 
of movies through thoughtless, almost arbitrary insertion of commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, commercials are necessary. But I've seen a commercial break interrupt a 
sentence. I've seen a commercial break interrupt a murder in a thriller. I've 
seen a commercial break interrupt a song in a musical. 
</P>
<P>
What I've never seen -- and would love to see -- is a movie interrupt a 
commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
Misleading ads for TV programs. For example, the print ads for ABC's recent 
"Hallmark Hall of Fame" movie "My Name is Bill W." featured James Woods 
alongside James Garner, evoking memories of their brilliant collaboration in 
the 1986 "Hallmark Hall of Fame" drama, "Promise." 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was that Woods' co-star in "My Name is Bill W." was not Garner 
but JoBeth Williams, whose name did not even appear in one ad for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
The popular Garner had a key role, but a relatively small supporting one. He 
was featured in the advertising instead of Williams because he was considered a 
bigger draw. 
</P>
<P>
Good business, bad ethics. 
</P>
<P>
An actor who passes himself off as an authority on an issue solely by virtue of 
having played a prominent role in a movie about that issue. Check out talk 
shows, morning shows and newspaper stories for this one. 
</P>
<P>
The routine goes something like this: Actor X stars in a movie about autism. 
Now it's time to promote the movie, and suddenly Actor X is the last word on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the fault is less the actor's than the star-dazzled media's for 
lacking the enterprise to find a genuine expert. 
</P>
<P>
A commercial for C&amp;R Clothiers. You know the one: A guy enters an elevator, 
turns to the guy on his right and smugly says, "Nice suit. C &amp; R?" 
Arrrrrgh! 
</P>
<P>
I admit the commercial does sell me. It sells me on the exquisite idea of doing 
something terrible to the arrogant twit who asked the question in the elevator. 
Like hitting him in the face with a pie. 
</P>
<P>
Nice goo on your face. Banana cream? 
</P>
<P>
News anchors who repeatedly go through that weary charade of attributing the 
weather to weathercasters. Did they personally make it rain or something? 
</P>
<P>
Weather radar and all the goofy video paraphernalia that weathercasters use to 
make their weathercasts absolutely incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't they admit that these are all gimmicks whose sole purpose is to 
dazzle, not inform viewers? Yes, nothing is more exciting than a visual of a 
"low" unwinding. 
</P>
<P>
What I love best, though, are those white blobs that represent cloud covers, as 
if this were somehow meaningful. Instead, it looks like someone blew his nose 
on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who alter the meaning of quotes through editing. The culprit Monday 
was KABC-TV Channel 7 sportscaster Jim Hill, in his report on former 
heavyweight champ George Foreman on the comeback trail. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed after destroying his latest patsy in Galveston, Tex., Foreman faced 
the camera and began ranting and raving, claiming that current heavyweight 
champ Mike Tyson and contender Evander Holyfield were afraid to fight him. Then 
Foreman quickly turned to the reporter interviewing him and added with a grin: 
"That was pretty good, wasn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
KNBC's Fred Roggin and KCBS-TV's Keith Olbermann provided the right context by 
using Foreman's entire quote. Hill, however, put a different spin on the story 
by using only the tirade. 
</P>
<P>
Nice suit, though. C &amp; R?

The jury trying Oliver North on criminal charges is still out, but the verdict 
on him in entertainment terms is in: Thumbs down. The first part of CBS' "Guts 
&amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall of Oliver North," ran third in its time period 
Sunday night, ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed Tuesday. CBS' two-hour 
drama attracted viewers in about 12.7 million homes, compared to 16 million for 
NBC's "Bionic Showdown" and 13.7 million for ABC's "My Name Is Bill W." The 
full list of ratings for last week can be found on Page 8.

<P>
* Lucille Ball went out a winner in the TV ratings. The news special that CBS 
broadcast about her on the night she died last Wednesday was seen in about 13.7 
million homes, compared to 11 million for ABC's "China Beach" and 10.5 million 
for NBC's "Nightingales."

APOLOGY IN ATTEMPTED RAPE CASE INCLUDES GRISLY SOUVENIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The janitor and the young woman met in an evening English class at a local high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Both were Korean, and they soon became friends, studying their English lessons 
together. On April 19, Yoon No Yoon asked her for a ride to work, telling her 
his car was broken, sheriff's deputies said. Yoon had to drive, he said, 
because the directions were so difficult. He drove instead to a spot near Zuma 
Beach, deputies say, where he began "making advances" at knifepoint, ripping 
her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
She fought him off, police said, and when he took her home, she called the 
Rampart Division police station. 
</P>
<P>
The attempted rape report was duly passed along to Malibu sheriff's deputies, 
and there matters lay until Monday, police said, when the 31-year-old janitor 
telephoned the young woman's home and said he wanted to apologize. According to 
police, Yoon asked the woman to meet him at McDonald's in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the young woman called the Rampart station. On Monday night, she 
and her father went to the restaurant. So did police. The janitor from Seoul 
was already there, waiting to talk. 
</P>
<P>
He never got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrested Yoon, they found he had brought with him a manila 
envelope. Inside were two contrite letters written in Korean to the woman and 
-- encased in an opaque crystal box -- a more substantial token of his remorse. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers opened (the box) up," said Sgt. Alex Salazar, and inside, in a 
glass vial surrounded by a ring of small black glass beads, "there was a little 
pinky finger floating in some liquid." 
</P>
<P>
Yoon, whose left hand was bandaged from the amputation between the joints of 
the finger, was arrested and booked on suspicion of attempted rape, police 
said. His bail was set at $100,000. The fingertip is being kept as evidence by 
the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
When Yoon was arrested, "he was confused that after he did what he did, cutting 
his finger and giving her this remorseful token, that she would get the police 
involved," Salazar said. Yoon reportedly indicated as much to a Korean-speaking 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a way for him to express his remorse," Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Tradition 
</P>
<P>
Although one police officer surmised that the act was a cultural ritual, 
experts say such a mutilation is no more a Korean cultural tradition than 
Vincent Van Gogh's act of cutting off his ear for a woman was a Dutch or French 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Cutting off a finger, or self-mutilation in any form, is not a normal cultural 
act," said Susan Chung, a psychiatrist at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in 
Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
"In apologizing for some misbehavior, clearly, people don't go through this 
kind of serious action," said Chung, who counsels Korean patients, many of them 
recent immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the possibility of Yoon's agitated mental state, Chung said that 
such an extreme act might also stem from a cultural belief that someone who 
commits a shameful act should not require outside punishment in order to feel 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, in Korean culture, a shameful act should be handled inside the family 
or inside a very small circle of people," Chung said, or "as in this case, 
apparently the individual was taking responsibility for criticizing and 
punishing himself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern Accounts 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Byung-yul Yoon (no relation), clinical psychologist at the Asian Pacific 
Counseling and Treatment Center in Hollywood, said such behavior -- cutting off 
half the small finger and offering it in apology -- has been romanticized in 
modern accounts of Japanese gangster or "yakuza" activities, the only occasion 
the practice has surfaced recently. 
</P>
<P>
Yoon No Yoon was being questioned by sheriff's and district attorney's 
investigators Tuesday evening. He was expected to be arraigned this morning.

SEWAGE SPILL SHUTS BEACH FROM VENICE TO EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sewage spill near the San Diego Freeway prompted Los Angeles County health 
officials Tuesday to close almost four miles of beaches between Venice and 
Imperial Highway at El Segundo as a precautionary measure in the event polluted 
water reached the ocean through flood control channels. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 gallons of sewage escaped Monday night from an Inglewood pumping 
station into the Centinela concrete channel, but sandbagging efforts kept all 
but about 1,000 gallons from leaking into Ballona Creek and flowing to the 
ocean, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
County health technicians were analyzing the bacteria count along the beaches 
and said that a decision to reopen the popular swimming areas could be made as 
soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really fortunate we were able to get almost all of it," said John 
Redner, the county's sewer superintendent, who oversaw sandbagging operations 
in Centinela Creek. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage reached the channel just a few minutes after six county workers had 
piled 800 50-pound bags at the channel's edge at about 10:15 p.m., he said. The 
sewage flowed from the nearby Vesta Street sewer pumping station in Inglewood, 
which was knocked out of commission at 6:22 p.m. by an electrical power 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
"The water surged and we could smell it," Redner said. 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for closing the beaches on Tuesday -- a sunny, warm day -- fell 
to county health official Jack Petralia, who said he was warned about the spill 
at 9:30 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning Signs 
</P>
<P>
Because the spill appeared to be relatively minor, Petralia said he was 
"tempted" not to take any action. But at 8 a.m. Tuesday, as a "precautionary 
measure," he called the county Department of Beaches and Harbors and ordered 
that agency to instruct lifeguards to post yellow sandwich-board signs on the 
beach. They read: "Beach Closed: Avoid Water Contact." 
</P>
<P>
Some local residents were angry Tuesday morning that it had taken more than 10 
hours for Petralia to make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Why wasn't the beach closed early this morning before people started swimming 
in the water?" asked Venice resident Vince Desmond, 48, who said he swims at 
the beach every morning. 
</P>
<P>
Petralia, who directs the county Department of Health Services' environmental 
protection bureau, said that given experience with leaks, sewage takes far 
longer than 10 hours for the fouled water to reach the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Take Days 
</P>
<P>
"It could be days," he said, before the approximately 1,000 gallons of sewage 
that escaped reaches the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
By the time an alarm alerted officials to the spill Monday night, a portion of 
the county sewer system had already backed up and sewage was gushing out of 
manhole covers just north of where La Cienega crosses the San Diego Freeway, 
about 40 feet from the pumping plant. From that point, the sewage flowed into 
Centinela Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Avila said, the Vesta Street plant is one of six county sewage 
pumping plants scheduled to receive emergency power equipment that would have 
prevented a spill like the one that occurred Monday night. But delivery of that 
equipment is still two months away, he said.

Lawyers for Night Stalker defendant Richard Ramirez raised the possibility 
Tuesday that they may not call any defense witnesses in the serial-murder 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The possible trial strategy was disclosed shortly before Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Michael A. Tynan granted the defense attorneys several days off to 
further consult with one another and with Ramirez and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Outside court, Ray G. Clark, one of Ramirez's lawyers, said only that he and 
co-counsel Daniel V. Hernandez need the additional time for "trial preparation" 
and to reconcile their "differences in style, approach and techniques." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Clark nor Hernandez said outright that there would be no defense 
witnesses. But during a bench conference among the judge, Clark, Hernandez and 
co-prosecutors Phil Halpin and Alan Yochelson, the defense attorneys mentioned 
the no-defense approach as one alternative. The trial will resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Further Discussion 
</P>
<P>
After granting the extension, Tynan ordered the lawyers back in court Monday 
morning for further discussions about the defense lawyers' intentions. The 
judge instructed the 23 jurors and alternates to return that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution rested its case Tuesday after recalling a final witness, Felipe 
Solano, to clarify his earlier testimony, which he admitted had been less than 
truthful. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Hernandez were to have begun their case after the witness was 
excused. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, Solano said he had lied earlier when he said he never 
bought stolen goods from anyone other than Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Solano said, he has bought stolen goods from at least three other 
people. But Solano stood by his earlier testimony that Ramirez had sold or 
given him many of the items that were later linked by other witnesses to seven 
of the 15 Night Stalker attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine percent of what I bought, I bought from him," Solano said, 
referring to the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Solano said he had lied in order to protect a woman who also had sold him 
stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
Solano was the 138th prosecution witness to testify in the trial, which began 
Jan. 30. Prosecutors also have introduced more than 500 pieces of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
After the prosecution rested its case the first time, on April 13, Clark said 
the main thrust of the defense would be that Ramirez was a victim of mistaken 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Hernandez have refused to say -- most recently on Monday -- whether 
they would call Ramirez to testify on his own behalf. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Clark said the defense lawyers might call up to 12 
new witnesses as well as recall some who had testified earlier on behalf of the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
But until Tuesday, neither Clark nor Hernandez had raised the possibility that 
they would not call any witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys in criminal trials sometimes call no witnesses of their own, 
hoping to win the case merely by arguing that the prosecution failed to prove 
the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harsh Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's unusual court session also was characterized by harsh words between 
Halpin and Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney suggested that Halpin had knowingly allowed Solano to lie 
under oath. Halpin rejected that charge and characterized Hernandez's failure 
to have discovered Solano's untruthful testimony, which Halpin himself brought 
out in court on Monday, as "glaring incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
Solano was called back to testify after Halpin, a deputy district attorney, 
disclosed Monday that a prosecution witness had withheld information in earlier 
court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Damage 
</P>
<P>
Halpin admitted that the exposure of Solano as a liar might damage the 
prosecution's case because it opens the possibility that the jury could be 
ordered to disregard Solano's testimony altogether. But the prosecutor noted 
that Solano's testimony comprises only a part of the case against Ramirez, 
which also includes shoe prints, fingerprints and witness identifications. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, 29, is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies in a string of 
night-time attacks throughout Los Angeles County, mostly in the spring and 
summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said his client was "very upset" over Solano's perjury.

2 GRANDCHILDREN WITNESS SLAYING OF DRIVER BY MAN FROM OTHER CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Padilla, a 57-year-old restaurateur who loved to spend time with his 12 
grandchildren, was driving two of them home in the Florence area when a car cut 
him off in an alley, according to the sheriff's deputies who investigated the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
They said Padilla honked his horn, a short argument ensued and suddenly, as his 
11-year-old granddaughter and 9-year-old grandson watched in horror, a 
passenger in the other car got out, pulled a gun and shot Padilla dead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally senseless," Padilla's daughter, Lori Lashinsky, said Tuesday. 
"It happened just because someone wanted to drive in front of him. It happened 
for no reason at all." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said it had been years -- 25 or so -- since Padilla first opened the 
small restaurant -- named Lupita's, in honor of his wife, Lupe -- on Compton 
Avenue in the Florence area. 
</P>
<P>
They said the restaurant, which specializes in Mexican food in a largely Latino 
neighborhood, wasn't a huge success, but it did all right. And the Padillas, 
who lived a block away, on Makee Avenue, in a tidy, modest home decorated with 
family photos, were said to be one of the best-known and best-liked families in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a really nice guy," said his son-in-law, Tom Lashinsky. "He was always 
laughing, always happy." 
</P>
<P>
"He loved to be with the kids," Lori Lashinsky said. "They all called him 
'Grandpa,' and they loved him. He used to take them to the pizza place, where 
they have the rides and the slides and the pinball machines." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was the day Padilla's 11-year-old granddaughter, Karina, was graduating 
from elementary school, and he wanted to make sure he got pictures of the 
event. So, on his way back to their nearby home Monday night, after they'd 
stopped by the house on Makee Avenue, Padilla took Karina and her brother, 
Charles, to a drugstore to pick up some film. 
</P>
<P>
"We were back in the car, heading out the alley from Thrifty's, when this car 
went in front of my grandfather's," Karina said Tuesday. "My grandfather 
honked. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The car stopped, and the passenger got out and came up to my grandfather's 
window," she said. "Grandpa tried to close it, but the man held it open. . . . 
</P>
<P>
" 'What's your problem?' the man asked. 'Nothing,' Grandpa said. The man asked 
him that several times, and Grandpa said the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the man pulled out a gun and shot him." 
</P>
<P>
Karina's brother ran from the car in one direction as the assailant fled on 
foot in another, according to Karina. Moments later, she said, a 14-year-old 
boy ran up and tried to help the mortally wounded man. 
</P>
<P>
Karina said she ran after her brother, eventually finding him in a nearby 
restaurant. Meanwhile, she said, the other boy drove her grandfather to the 
nearby Firestone sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very brave boy," Charles Padilla Jr. -- the father of Karina and 
her brother, said later. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the stricken man was rushed to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 9:10 p.m. Monday. Investigators 
described the man who shot Padilla and the man behind the wheel of the car that 
cut him off as in their late 20s or early 30s. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Lashinsky, who lives with her husband and their children in Victorville, 
said crime has been increasing in the Florence neighborhood where she grew up 
and she has been increasingly worried about her parents' safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted him to sell that restaurant because we were afraid something would 
happen there," she said. "Now this happens, and it has nothing to do with it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MIDWIFE SENTENCED IN 3 INFANT DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unlicensed midwife accused of murder in the deaths of three infants she 
helped deliver pleaded guilty Tuesday to involuntary manslaughter and received 
probation, but not before she was ordered by a judge to "stay as far away from 
pregnant women as you possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
Delores Doyle, 36, of Montclair, received a suspended eight-year prison 
sentence and was released on five years' probation. Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Judith C. Chirlin told Doyle not to provide any type of health care or 
work for anyone who does. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you nowhere near anybody or anything that anybody could interpret as 
your practicing medicine," Chirlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle entered the plea during the first month of her trial with co-defendant 
Dr. Milos Klvana, 48, a Valencia obstetrician, who faces nine murder charges. 
The prosecution contends that Klvana and Doyle did not recommend hospital 
treatment in cases where deliveries involved high-risk complications.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAROLEE CAPTURED AFTER BANK HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state prison parolee wanted in a series of bank robberies was captured 
Tuesday in Torrance after allegedly holding up a Wells Fargo bank for nearly 
$4,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Mooneyham, 41, was arrested after he was stopped in a car that witnesses 
said was used as the bank robber's getaway vehicle, Torrance Police Sgt. Jack 
McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred at 10:30 a.m. when a man walked into a Wells Fargo Bank 
branch at 21300 Hawthorne Blvd. and presented a teller with a threatening note, 
McDonals said. The teller handed about $3,900 to the robber, who fled in a car 
parked outside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses relayed the license number to police, and a motorcycle officer 
stopped the car in the 17900 block of Hawthorne Boulevard. Inside, 
investigators found $3,900 in cash, a hold-up note and a pistol, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Mooneyham, on parole from state prison, is suspected of at least nine other 
bank robberies in Southern California, McDonald said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY'S ADMINISTRATOR ABRUPTLY DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pomona City Administrator A.J. Wilson, who was lured out of retirement a year 
ago to revitalize the city, has been fired unexpectedly by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant was joined by colleagues Nell Soto and Tomas 
Ursua, who was elected in March, in voting to oust Wilson at an executive 
session of the council late Monday. Mayor Donna Smith wanted Wilson retained, 
and Councilman Mark Nymeyer left the meeting in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said Wilson usurped council authority and would not follow directions. 
Wilson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 47, was a former city manager of Kansas City, Mo., where he eventually 
resigned under pressure. Earlier, he spent three years in Santa Ana as city 
manager, helping to initiate an aggressive redevelopment program. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Patrick J. Sampson was temporarily named to the manager's post.

L.A. PROBING DONATIONS BY DEVELOPERS TO PICUS AND WOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators are looking into multiple developer contributions accepted by 
recently reelected City Council members Joy Picus and Michael Woo as possible 
violations of Los Angeles' strict $500-per-person limit on campaign 
contributions, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Since voters passed the campaign limit in 1985, there have been repeated 
accusations that candidates and contributors are seeking to circumvent the law 
through various strategies. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Elias Martinez confirmed Tuesday that his office is investigating 
both Picus' and Woo's campaign statements at the request of the city attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Although Martinez would give no details, Woo campaign manager Steve Afriat said 
the investigation centers on 14 contributions of $500 each accepted by the 
councilman from seven executives of the Lycon Group, a development firm, and 
from their children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returned Some Donations 
</P>
<P>
"We returned half of the contributions, those from the children, because they 
seemed to go against the law, because the money actually appeared to come from 
the parents," Afriat said. 
</P>
<P>
"But Mike didn't catch it right away, so the returns didn't show up on our last 
campaign statement in late March. So I guess someone complained." 
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that investigators would drop the case once they 
examine the cancelled checks by which the seven contributions from children of 
executives were returned. 
</P>
<P>
The Picus inquiry stems from a letter sent to City Atty. James K. Hahn by Paul 
McKellips, one of five candidates whom the councilwoman edged out in the 
election April 11. 
</P>
<P>
McKellips said Tuesday that he urged investigators to look into $500 
contributions from Sherman Oaks developer Edward L. Saunders, his wife and son 
Brad, who lives at the family home in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raises Question 
</P>
<P>
"When a child lives at home, it raises the question of whether he put up the 
money or whether his parents did it using him as a figurehead," McKellips said. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad is swimming in money," Anita Harkavy, an executive assistant at Saunders 
Development Corp., said Tuesday. "He is very wealthy on his own without mom and 
dad." 
</P>
<P>
She termed Brad Saunders, 22, an "enthusiastic supporter of Picus in his own 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Also questioned by McKellips were three $500 contributions from Selleck 
Properties Inc., a Woodland Hills development firm. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the checks were sent in the name of other firms with the same address -- 
Sherman Way-White Oak Associates and Tampa-Saticoy Associates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Businesses? 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the law also limits business entities to $500 each per candidate, 
McKellips asked, "Are these really separate businesses? I think that should be 
checked into." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Selleck, managing general partner and brother of actor Tom Selleck, said 
Tuesday that he is convinced that the three firms, each of which is a different 
partnership, "are separate under the law's definition.

REVIEW OF BRADLEY'S STOCK DEALINGS REFERRED TO SEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A review of Mayor Tom Bradley's stock transactions has been referred to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission for investigation, City Atty. James K. Hahn 
revealed today. 
</P>
<P>
The transactions include several profitable investments handled by Drexel 
Burnham Lambert and Michael Milken, who headed the firm's high-yield junk bond 
operations and has since been indicted on charges of racketeering, insider 
trading and securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn made the disclosure after a hearing of the City Council's Government 
Operations Committee on allegations that Bradley violated conflict-of-interest 
restrictions by acting as an adviser to Far East National Bank and joining the 
board of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg told the committee that a $2-million 
investment in certificates of deposit at Far East, which paid Bradley $18,000 
in consulting fees in 1988, was made without influence by or pressure from the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg also took responsibility for a "screw-up" that resulted in a loss to 
the city of about $12,000 in interest on $600,000 in federal transit funds left 
in a non-interest-bearing account for three months at Far East in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, this office was notified in mid-August (of 1987) that that money 
was deposited in Far East," he said. "This office then was extremely negligent 
-- and I guess I'll have to take responsibility for that -- in that we did not 
move that money out of Far East National Bank until Nov. 9." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's office released a letter from the Community Redevelopment Agency to 
Anton Calleia, the mayor's chief administrative assistant and the man who 
controlled the account, informing him that the Urban Mass Transit 
Administration grant had been received. The letter is dated June 19, 1987. In 
another letter dated June 22, Calleia instructed City Controller Rick Tuttle to 
deposit the money in a city account, then transfer it to the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chandler, press spokesman for the mayor, said the letters establish that 
Calleia thought that the money would be sent where it belonged.

WITNESS TO PALMDALE STABBING AIDS VICTIM, PURSUES, SEIZES SUSPECT

<P>
A witness to a stabbing in Palmdale Tuesday night did more than just watch. 
</P>
<P>
When Hank Adame, 34, saw one man stab another during a street fight, he aided 
the victim, then chased the attacker a mile to a bar and subdued him with the 
help of patrons until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Harris, 30, of Lancaster, was charged with attempted murder and was 
being held without bail today at the Antelope Valley sheriff's substation. The 
stabbing victim, 21-year-old Keith Harper of Palmdale, underwent surgery for 
five stab wounds to the chest and abdomen at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. 
He was in stable condition today, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ron Bozeman said Harris is suspected of stabbing Harper at about 10:30 
p.m. Tuesday after an argument over a woman escalated into a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Adame, a Rosamond resident who was in a nearby parking lot, saw the stabbing 
and helped Harper into a car that Harper's cousin drove to the hospital, Sgt. 
Ron Shreves said. Adame then pursued Harris to the Wel-Com-Inn bar, where he 
told patrons of the stabbing. They helped him subdue Harris and called the 
police, Shreves said.

The jogger who was severely beaten and raped by a gang of youths in Central 
Park has awakened from her coma, though she remains delirious, doctors said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Metropolitan Hospital said the 28-year-old woman was able to talk in 
a whisper to relatives and staff members, raise two fingers when asked and read 
large signs. Though she has little facial expression, she has smiled, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She has been emerging gradually over the last couple of days or three days," 
said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz. "We would still say . . . she is in a delirium. 
People in this stage will fluctuate."

Six teen-agers have been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy 
and assault in the April 19 attack.

RETURN BOY TO TUSTIN, SWEDEN SAYS

<P>
A Swedish court today ordered that a 3-year-old Tustin boy be returned to his 
mother after her estranged husband took the child to Sweden after staging a 
boating accident about seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Marci Steele picked up 3-year-old Schyler Steele from the Swedish foster home 
where the two of them had been staying and left for Stockholm, from where she 
plans to leave for the United States today or tomorrow, according to a worker 
at the foster home. Marci Steele was awarded custody of Schyler when the couple 
separated last year. 
</P>
<P>
The father, Scott Steele, remains in a Swedish jail pending his extradition to 
the United States on criminal charges alleging grand theft, forgery and bad 
checks in Riverside and Orange counties. Steele said in an interview from jail 
that the Swedish custody hearing was unfair and that he plans to appeal the 
custody when he returns to the United States.

<P>
An 18-year-old Los Amigos High School student was arrested this morning on 
suspicion of stabbing a fellow student in the chest on a school parking lot 
after the two argued, Fountain Valley Lt. Larry Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel G. Bonghanoy of Santa Ana was arrested about 10:33 a.m. at his job in 
Santa Ana after he allegedly stabbed a 16-year-old student in the chest about 
7:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Griswold said witnesses said the stabbing followed an incident in which a car 
occupied by the victim was cut off by another in the lot. Bonghanoy, who was 
driving nearby, laughed at the victim and several friends after the incident, 
Griswold said. An argument ensued, and the suspect allegedly stabbed the victim 
once in the chest, Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name is being withheld because he is a minor, suffered a 
one-inch wound and was treated by paramedics and taken to Fountain Valley 
Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
When trying to flee the scene, Bonghanoy allegedly injured another student by 
running over his foot in the school's parking lot, Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonghanoy was booked at Orange County Jail on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon. His bail was set for $10,000.

AREA TOO DIVERSE, JUDGE SAYS

<P>
In a setback for the federal government's campaign against major distributors 
of pornography, a judge today dismissed racketeering charges against a Woodland 
Hills video distributor, saying he could not find that the graphic films he 
sold violated community standards. 
</P>
<P>
Granting an acquittal in the only Los Angeles case brought in the Justice 
Department's crackdown on obscenity, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon said 
he could not conclude that films such as "Kneel Before Me" and "Beyond DeSade" 
were "patently offensive" in an area as diverse as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The great majority of people in this town would be incensed by this," the 
judge stated in his oral decision. "I just do not believe that unless you have 
positive evidence of what the entire community believes in this area, that any 
judge could say what goes on in the so-called edge of this area, whether it's 
obscene, or (merely) pornographic." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers said the decision may make it more difficult for prosecutors to 
bring obscenity cases in metropolitan areas. "In a way, what the court did, 
which is of nationwide significance, is call into question the Supreme Court's 
assumption that you can tell if material is patently offensive just by looking 
at it," defense attorney Stanley Fleishman said. "The historic fact as I see it 
is that in America today, the American people tolerate virtually any sexual 
material." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4th Case in Nation 
</P>
<P>
The case against Rubin Gottesman, owner of X-Citement Video Inc. and R. G. 
Sales Co. in Van Nuys, was the fourth obscenity case in the nation to be filed 
under federal racketeering laws, which allow prosecutors to seize the assets of 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the statute, prosecutors had sought to seize Gottesman's Woodland Hills 
home, his stock and ownership interests in both companies, his personal and 
corporate bank accounts and office furniture and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment was one of a series returned in a campaign prompted in part by 
the 1986 report of a Justice Department commission that found a link between 
some sexually explicit material and violence. 
</P>
<P>
The four films alleged to be obscene in this case included graphic depictions 
of group sex, oral sex, beatings and bondage. One included a gang rape scene in 
a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has held that only materials that are "patently offensive" 
when measured against community standards and that appeal primarily to 
"prurient interests" can be adjudged obscene. But the defense argued that in 
metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, it is virtually impossible to determine 
what may be offensive to the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors presented one expert witness who testified that materials such as 
those cited in the indictment are not readily available on video shelves in Los 
Angeles, an indication, perhaps, that even regular purveyors of pornography 
consider them outside the scope of most films. But Kenyon said that may only 
indicate that distributors " would say it's not worth the risk" of potential 
prosecution.

Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist urged Congress today to give the nation's 
federal judges an immediate 30% pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Calling inadequate salaries "the most serious threat to the future of the 
judiciary," Rehnquist sought support for legislation providing the raise and 
regular cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not, in my view, fairly termed a pay raise," Rehnquist said in a 
statement to the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee. "This is 
instead a partial recapture of the tremendous decline in purchasing power that 
has affected judicial salaries over the last 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
He said he recognizes that there was "widespread public opposition" to a 
defeated proposal for a much larger 51% pay raise for senior government 
officials, including members of Congress and federal judges.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today played down an apparent disparity between 
his assessment of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chances of 
implementing reforms and the opinion held by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"The President and I were in a meeting yesterday and frankly chuckled at what 
has developed by way of press commentary on views that we have expressed. We do 
not perceive a significant difference in terms of our views of the situation 
with respect to the Soviet Union," Cheney told the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary, who has been on the job for less than two months, 
created a stir last week when he predicted that Gorbachev would fail at 
instituting reforms in the Soviet Union and would be replaced by a hard-liner. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the United States should not take any unilateral steps, such as 
removing some of the U.S. troops stationed in Europe, in response to the Soviet 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and White House Chief of Staff John 
H. Sununu quickly offered more hopeful assessments about Gorbachev's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary conceded today that he "responded previously the other 
day perhaps with more candor than was warranted about my view . . . somewhat 
pessimistic concerning Mr. Gorbachev's prospect for achieving his reforms."

The judge in Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra trial said today he ordered longer 
working days and shorter lunches for the jury deciding the fired White House 
aide's fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt there was time being wasted in the sense that when they came in in the 
morning they were not starting as early as they could have," Judge Gerhard A. 
Gesell said at a hearing to answer attorneys' questions. "I simply told a 
marshal to get them in here by 9 and not to take them home before 5." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell refused a prosecution request to intervene to see what was taking jury 
members so long to reach a decision. The panel deliberated for an 11th day 
today.

Soviet trade unions, long closely controlled by Communist authorities, will be 
given the right to strike under a draft law to be adopted in the next few 
months, union leader Stepan Shalayev said today. 
</P>
<P>
The draft law, which sets out a broad range of powers for unions, follows 
sporadic reports from across the country of wildcat strikes by miners, bus 
drivers and carpet weavers demanding better pay and conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The right (to strike) is being considered as a means to press management to 
speed up the resolution of labor disputes," Shalayev said in an interview with 
the trade union daily Trud. "But it is an extreme measure which should be 
applied only in exceptional cases." He said work stoppages should "not be 
considered a normal phenomenon in our society."

Cosmetics giant Avon Products Inc. today disclosed that corporate raider Irwin 
Jacobs and door-to-door home products seller Amway Corp. together bought 10% of 
its stock, but Avon said it is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Avon stock jumped $4.875 to $37 in initial trading after the news was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Avon refused any further comment on widely circulated market rumors that Jacobs 
and Amway have made a buyout proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The company said only that it "has been notified" that the partnership owns 
their stock, but Avon would not say who approached the company. 
</P>
<P>
Avon is a worldwide cosmetics and direct selling company with sales of $3 
billion in 1988. But it lost $404 million in the year due in part to the costs 
of a restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
While declining to comment on whether an actual buyout proposal had been made, 
the company said, "We believe that Avon can provide the best value to its 
shareholders by remaining independent." 
</P>
<P>
For several days Minneapolis-based Jacobs has been rumored as a possible suitor 
for Avon and its stock has been actively traded. The entry of Ada, Mich.-based 
Amway was a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs was not immediately available to comment. Other parties rumored to be 
interested in Avon include Unilever PLC of Britain and Revlon Group Inc. chief 
Ronald Perelman. 
</P>
<P>
Unilever has declined comment and Perelman was not immediately available to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Takeover talk surfaced about Avon after Unilever last week said it ceased 
negotiations over the purchase of U.S. toiletries firm Faberge, analysts said.

AMERICA WEST BIDS FOR EASTERN'S SHUTTLE;

America West Airlines Inc. said today it has submitted a proposal to buy 
Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle and 10 Boeing 757 planes for $726 million 
in a deal that would top an offer from developer Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive regional carrier based in Phoenix said it would pay $390 million 
cash for the shuttle. Eastern has already agreed to Trump's $365-million bid 
for the profitable Boston-New York-Washington shuttle, plus 17 smaller, older 
Boeing 727s. 
</P>
<P>
However, all sales of Eastern assets must be approved by the federal bankruptcy 
court overseeing the airline's Chapter 11 reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy Proceedings 
</P>
<P>
America West said it submitted the proposal as part of Eastern's bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle -- the name the developer plans to use 
for the shuttle -- said, "We have no comment. We don't know anything about it," 
referring to the America West proposal. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "We have a signed contract with Eastern." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern filed for protection from creditors five days after its machinists, 
pilots and flight attendants unions walked off the job March 4. 
</P>
<P>
The airline began moving ahead with plans to sell $1.8 billion in assets and 
rebuild on a much smaller scale after attempts to sell the entire company 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has pushed to have Eastern sold in its 
entirety and scheduled a hearing today for arguments over why such an auction 
should not take place. 
</P>
<P>
Billionaire hotel executive Jay Pritzker, former baseball Commissioner Peter 
Ueberroth and takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, who owns Trans World Airlines 
Inc., are among the investors who have expressed interest in Eastern at various 
points during the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Noted 
</P>
<P>
America West has indicated its interest in buying Eastern's shuttle or other 
assets several times since the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as April 28, America West Chairman Edward Beauvais said the company 
was interested in buying the shuttle if the sale to Trump fell through. 
Beauvais said then that America West had lined up tentative outside financing 
and was prepared to bid $600 million to $700 million for the shuttle and a 
number of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
America West is the nation's 10th-largest carrier and serves 46 destinations 
throughout the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The company turned a $45-million loss in 1987 into a profit of $9.4 million 
last year.

Bell Helicopter Textron will begin layoffs next week unless the Pentagon 
restores funding for the Osprey V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, a company spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Defense Department, Bell said it would halt work on the 
program Friday and begin laying off about 2,000 employees beginning Monday. 
Bell has been threatening to lay off employees since last week when it became 
clear the Osprey was in trouble. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Tuesday 
announced $10 billion in defense cuts, and among the items eliminated was the 
$1.8-million V-22 program. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the V-22 remains intact through Sept. 30, but in a letter to the 
Naval Air Systems Command dated April 28, Bell said it would stop work on the 
program Friday and begin layoffs Monday unless the Defense Department comes up 
with more money.

CLIPPERS TOLD TO ARBITRATE WITH WALTON

<TEXT>
<P>
A judge ordered the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team today to meet with an 
arbitrator to try to settle a contract dispute with former player Bill Walton 
amid allegations of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Clippers publicly alleged that Walton had used 
illegal drugs while under contract, which the team said hampered the player's 
recovery from basketball injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, 36, who was accompanied by a lawyer in court, denied using drugs while 
he played for the team, which moved from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arguments Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski rejected arguments by Clippers lawyer Gary 
Platt that the team's dispute with Walton should be settled before a judge 
rather than through arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski said Walton's contract required the team to try to resolve the 
dispute first in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers contend that they should no longer have to make deferred payments 
to Walton, whose contract calls for him to receive $200,000 a year through 
1996, or $1.6 million.

The San Francisco 49ers have waived running back Doug DuBose, who finished the 
season on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
DuBose, in his second year out of Nebraska, injured his knee against the Los 
Angeles Rams on Dec. 18. He rushed 24 times for 116 yards and two touchdowns 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
DuBose, waived Tuesday, was suspended for four weeks of training camp before 
the 1988 season after failing a drug test. General Manager John McVay declined 
to say if the waiver was drug-related.

A Klamath Falls group has withdrawn its request that the 1998 Winter Olympic 
Games be held in the southern Oregon city. 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal came Tuesday in a meeting here between the Klamath Falls Winter 
Games Organizing Committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee's site selection 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason is we can't meet their requirements for data, which are required by 
Friday," said Linda Grover, a member of the organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
She said the site team wanted explicit data on funding facilities, traffic 
flows, revenue sources and studies on projected income from the facilities 
after the Olympics, among other information. 
</P>
<P>
"They want a mountain of information," said Michael Hartfield, a city 
spokesman. "Nobody knew they wanted that kind of information just to make the 
initial decision." 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member site selection team toured Klamath Falls and the surrounding 
ski areas, including Mt. Bachelor ski resort and Diamond Lake Nordic skiing 
area, on Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Klamath Falls was the last stop on the team's 21-day tour of the five U.S. 
cities in the running as the U.S. entry for the 1998 Winter Games.

The Associated Press reported erroneously Monday that Glenn Golenberg, owner of 
Golenberg &amp; Co. of Cleveland, was among eight people who agreed to 
surrender illicit profits for alleged insider trading in Revco stock. Golenberg 
agreed to pay a $470,000 penalty, but the federal government found no evidence 
that he profited from information he gained as Revco's investment adviser.
