Congratulations on your first edition of the World Report (April 24)! Well over 
half of my business is conducted overseas and I have always found The Times to 
be a little short on international coverage. 
</P>
<P>
A suggestion: Would you include a table of currency exchange rates like you did 
for the economic indicators? An even better idea would be to have the exchange 
rates listed daily in the Business section.

Major newspapers come under fire for exposing fat content of McDonald's 
products; told to "check with company" before printing ad.

Headline -- April 19, editorial, "That Wonderful Big Mac Attack"! Public

The article by Cynthia Ozick on the story of two Jewish cousins who will never 
meet makes me sad (Op-Ed Page, April 17). She tells of anti-Semitism in Russia 
and by the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds hopeless. Then I think about a Beyond War Award ceremony I attended 
last fall. One of the recipients was a village in Israel. In this village 
Palestinians and Jews are living together, working together, cooperating and 
relating to each other as very good friends. It was astounding to see how the 
Jewish and the Arab representatives of the village spoke of their respect and 
love for each other. 
</P>
<P>
If people are given half a chance they will work together. They will solve 
their mutual problems. I think that the best way that we can help people to 
work together is to provide the framework for nations to work together. We now 
try to solve things unilaterally. We should instead work to strengthen the 
United Nations. Then problems that cannot be resolved by individual people and 
nations would at least have a legal framework for doing so.

EVEN RATS GET THE BETTER OF THE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider one advantage of being born into the world as a kangaroo rat in 
Riverside County: You're exempt from malathion spaying. Now it's we humans who 
are saying "rats." 
</P>
<P>
Only the guests at an outdoor church event a couple of months ago in Orange 
County have ever gotten a spraying exemption. The Crystal Cathedral got its 
reprieve when the Medfly Project made an exception it later came to regret. 
State officials received howls of protest and later pledged that there would be 
no more exemptions from the aerial application of malathion over Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But now, it seems, the kangaroo rat also has friends in high places. When it 
appeared that malathion would be sprayed near Woodcrest, where the rats cavort 
on the grasslands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stepped in. The agency 
worried about the safety of an endangered species. State agricultural officials 
were compelled to retreat on their pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Given these developments, what can humans worried about malathion hope for? 
That the human race itself be elevated to the status of an endangered species, 
and thus exempted by law from malathion spraying? Or, if the ancient theory of 
reincarnation has merit, perhaps humans might return to Riverside County as a 
protected kangaroo rat? Short of these solutions, they can hope the spraying 
stops, or resign themselves to living with the unsettling conclusion reached by 
an anti-malathion activist in Burbank: "This says to me that kangaroo rats are 
more important than humans."

How hopeful it is to find side-by-side articles by (former) Israeli Gen. 
Harkabi and high-ranking Palestinian Hassan -- and to find them in such close 
agreement! But Hassan made one disturbing statement. 
</P>
<P>
Defining justice he wrote, "Justice for us is to have a homeland; justice for 
the Jews is to live in peace." To my senses this difference is more significant 
than mere nuance. Why not say squarely that justice for the Palestinians is to 
have a homeland and live in peace; justice for the Jews is to have a homeland 
and live in peace!

The editorial accolade for McDonald's promotional campaign to recycle its 
enormously polluting products is naive. Despite the overkill of commercialized 
sentiment regarding Earth Day, environmental awareness did not hatch yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
It has been warned about for at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, in 1971, our 8th-grade ecology teacher at Palms Junior High inspired our 
printing of ecology T-shirts, which we wore on our weekly bike rides to Marina 
del Rey to dig aluminum cans out of trash bins for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's may not have known about the problems of plastics and landfills 
then, but it surely knows that decimating rain forests so cattle can be raised 
to produce its (and Burger King's) beef is an unconscionable decimation of my 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's is able to insulate itself from bad press by stuffing dollars into 
leaking dikes. 
</P>
<P>
The good journalists and editors at The Times should be able to see the forest 
for the sake of the trees.

General Motors units: Detroit-based GM Hughes said its first-quarter profit 
fell 13% to $182.8 million as revenue dropped to $2.02 billion from $2.03 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
It cited defense spending cuts and a sharp drop in demand for automotive 
components. At Dallas-based Electronic Data Systems, first-quarter profit rose 
11% to $109.8 million as revenue climbed 10% to $1.42 billion. General Motors 
Acceptance Corp.'s income fell 6% to $336 million, which the Detroit unit 
attributed to lower financing income and earnings from insurance underwriting 
that offset lower borrowing costs. General Motors is to report overall results 
today.

South Carolina corrections officials say a May 16 performance by Brown was not

Mr. Brown and some of his associates . . . and does not fall within the scope

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: LATINO DIET ITEMS CAN BE MODIFIED TO REDUCE THEIR 
CHOLESTEROL CONTENT 
</P>

When Carol Franco learned she had high blood cholesterol, it came as "good 
news." 
</P>
<P>
At 39, Franco had been afraid that she was developing diabetes. "Every other 
member of my family has the disease, so I was relieved when my doctor told me 
that I only had a cholesterol problem," Franco said. Diabetes afflicts 14% of 
the Hispanic community but only 5% of the general population, according to the 
American Diabetes Assn. 
</P>
<P>
And although Franco's blood cholesterol is 270 milligrams per deciliter, which 
places her in the high-risk category for heart disease, she is optimistic. "If 
I watch my diet, I can lower my cholesterol," she said. "Diabetes would have 
been more difficult to control." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago Franco began modifying her menus to bring her cholesterol level 
closer to the desirable 200 milligrams per deciliter. She replaced many 
traditional Latino foods -- enchiladas, sweetbreads, quesadillas and avocados 
-- with whole grains, poultry and fish, and is seeing positive results. "Of 
course, I miss real Mexican dishes, some of my favorites," Franco said, "but I 
feel much healthier." And she is even able to treat herself to a bit of her 
favorite candy. 
</P>
<P>
The number of health-conscious Latinos like Franco appears to be growing, and a 
new program operated by the UC San Diego Cancer Center hopes to attract even 
more. Comida Da Vida (Food Gives Life) aims to teach Latino women how to 
improve their health by adjusting meal-planning and shopping habits. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other community nutrition plans, Comida Da Vida has been developed with 
cultural differences in mind, according to registered dietitian Joan Rupp, 
coordinator of epidemiology, prevention and control at the San Diego center. 
Written by Latino dietitians for Latino consumers, the program hopes to improve 
the ethnic group's food buying habits through a series of cooking 
demonstrations, brochures and recipes available at supermarkets in the San 
Diego area. And by changing long-held Latino ideas about what tastes good and 
what is healthy, the program could eventually decrease the number of Latino 
deaths due to chronic illness. 
</P>
<P>
"Most nutrition information (available in this country) is written in English 
and is designed with Middle America in mind," Rupp said. "The few materials 
available in Spanish are usually direct translations from English and don't 
take cultural differences into account. Consequently, few of our health 
messages are reaching non-English-speaking populations. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the accepted terminology sometimes works against us. For example, whole 
milk in Spanish is leche entera," Rupp explained. "Therefore, low-fat milk is 
viewed as missing something, or inferior, by many Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
Comida Da Vida emphasizes low-fat, high-fiber foods: lean beef, low-fat milk 
and cheese, apples, bananas, broccoli and cabbage. Tomatoes and red peppers, 
excellent sources of Vitamin C and major ingredients in Mexican cuisine, are 
highlighted. 
</P>
<P>
Following are a few of the program's serving suggestions and lower-fat Latino 
recipes: 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa can serve as a side salad if tomatoes, onions and peppers are cut into 
larger, bite-size pieces and are presented on a lettuce leaf and garnished with 
a wedge of lime and fresh cilantro. And in place of deep-fried chips with dip, 
the program recommends an appetizer of jicama and other vegetables served with 
salsa. 
</P>
<P>
Avocados can fit into a lower-fat diet, despite their high fat content. 
Moderation is the key: an average avocado contains about 300 calories and 30 
grams of fat. However, more than half the fat is monounsaturated, the type 
recommended by health experts. 
</P>
<P>
Corn tortillas are preferred over flour, which have slightly more fat. When 
buying flour tortillas, Comida Da Vida recommends those made with whole-wheat 
flour and vegetable oil instead of lard, a highly saturated fat. To reduce 
calories and fat, steam, do not fry, tortillas for soft tacos and enchiladas. 
</P>
<P>
Meat is a vital part of any diet, even a low-fat one. Leaner cuts, which are 
often tougher than fat-marbled meats, can be tenderized by marinating them in 
lemon juice, herbs and spices. Broiling the meat instead of frying will allow 
fat to drip off. The program also suggests ways to slice lean meats into cuts 
familiar to Latinos, such as those used for carne asada and bistek. 
</P>
<P>
Although lard contributes its own distinct flavor to Mexican dishes, it is 
highly saturated and should be avoided. A very small amount of vegetable oil 
can be used to fry fideo. And refried beans may be mashed with milk to provide 
texture and a creamier taste. 
</P>
<P>
Cheese is another high-fat ingredient popular in Mexican cuisine. Rather than 
eliminating it entirely, select queso fresco, a soft crumbly variety, and 
substitute low-fat Cheddar and Jack for regular cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
"Hispanics drink a lot of liquadas (a traditional fruit drink) in Mexico," Rupp 
said, "but in this country they tend to drink a lot of soda." As an alternative 
to soft drinks, she suggests a combination of frozen orange juice concentrate 
-- or other fruits such as mangoes, strawberries, blackberries, papaya or 
raspberries -- a banana, ice cubes and low-fat milk. When blended until frothy, 
the drink is a refreshing way to increase daily intake of fruit and calcium, 
both of which are poorly represented in many Latino diets.

ABOUT WINE: AT NEW ORLEANS TASTING, EVERYONE RAISED A GLASS TO VINTAGE 
BURGUNDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was one of the greatest wine events ever staged. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 20 wine connoisseurs experienced one of the greatest Burgundy 
tastings ever staged in this country. 
</P>
<P>
They learned two things: Some of the best wines of the past may have been 
tinkered with, making a wine that was technically illegal but nevertheless 
superb. And there is some evidence that red Burgundy may be, slowly, making a 
comeback to former glory. 
</P>
<P>
Tasting great Burgundy that has been properly aged, bottles that have attained 
that sublime richness nearly impossible to describe, is a rare treat. It is 
possible only for those who had the foresight to stash away some of the great 
wines while they were still being made and sold for reasonable prices. And in 
the view of many collectors, that was a long time ago. Today, prices for such 
old bottles are so high that buying them is unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, it's possible to buy young wines and age them yourself. Burgundies 
from the 1985, 1988 and 1989 vintages have gained great accolades. But after 
tasting the wines in New Orleans, I'd say that given the high prices and 
negative comments about some of the current vintages, even that is pretty 
dicey. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, praise for the recent vintages is looked on with great skepticism by 
people like Lloyd Flatt and Dr. Marvin Overton, two people with an abiding 
passion for great Burgundy who helped stage the April 21 event here. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five older red Burgundies, ranging from the 1942 through the 1959 
vintages, were served. The wines showed precisely why well-made old red 
Burgundy can be the greatest experience any wine lover could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
After the first few wines had been served, Overton, a Fort Worth, Tex., 
neurosurgeon, said, "What you want all your young Burgundies to smell and taste 
like are these front wines. There is a kinship between these wines and very 
young wines, because you see the fruit that was here when the wine was young." 
</P>
<P>
He said the humidor / tobacco, leather, charred rubber and cherry / beet aromas 
we saw in some of the wines were elements never seen when the wines were young. 
"It takes 20, 30 years to get these characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
He and Flatt, an aerospace engineer, both said today's red Burgundies simply 
don't match up to the wines of the past. Flatt said, "I don't feel the quality 
of the wine making today is the same as it was in the 1940s and 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
The two collectors spoke candidly about Burgundy's problems over the decades. 
World War II was not kind to Burgundy, they said; the war was literally fought 
in the vineyards and the vines took a devastating toll. When the war ended, 
major replanting was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"But the growers listened to the university people, who told them what to 
plant, and they planted the wrong clones," said Overton. He pointed out that 
instead of planting the older clone of Pinot Noir, one that trailed along the 
ground, they opted for one that grew upward, leaving a nice clear path in the 
vineyard for tractors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to making for easier tilling of the soil, the so-called Pinot Droit 
clone produced a larger crop. 
</P>
<P>
The Pinot Droit clone was indicted by Anthony Hanson in his 1982 book 
"Burgundy" as leading to thinner, less concentrated wine: "Some brokers and 
merchants believe that even in careful hands, Pinot Droits give inferior 
quality; that the generally big grapes produce wines lacking in character and 
short in life span." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in years past, worldwide demand for Burgundy was modest, and small 
production was not a concern. But as demand rose to its current frantic peak, 
prices jumped and there was great incentive for growers to make more and more 
wine from the same soil. It's simply not possible to produce more wine from the 
same acreage while simultaneously maintaining its depth and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
Also, both men said some older wines may have been made illegally, but that the 
results nearly always were superb. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the wines we tasted had a faint Port-like or brandy-like element to 
either the aroma or taste. Overton and Flatt pointed out that it was not 
unknown for some wines to have a dollop of brandy or port added before bottling 
to "fortify it for the long trip" (the aging cellar). 
</P>
<P>
The famed Dr. Barolet wines, collected in the cask by a merchant over many 
decades, are a case in point. (In the past some wine was shipped to England or 
Amsterdam in cask and bottled by a merchant, and the merchant could make such 
additions after tasting the wine. Such a task was usually left to a master 
blender, and it was considered a high art.) 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. (Arthur) Barolet was a colorful character who spent a lot of time 
accumulating some great old wines, and in the 1970s I bought a considerable 
amount of Dr. Barolets at auctions," said Flatt. "And I have tasted all of them 
many times and I question whether they've been played with, doctored" with the 
addition of port or brandy. "I've heard that even DRC (the Domaine de la 
Romanee-Conti) had added a little brandy now and then. But even if they do 
doctor them, well, who cares? The wines are great." 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans event ended with wines from the 1959 vintage, which Flatt said 
was "the last classic heavyweight vintage of Burgundy." Some of the tasters 
questioned that, and Overton said, "Well, you still can find a few great wines 
in the 1960s, but after 1969 you can forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Overton and Flatt said that a number of Burgundy houses began in the mid 1970s 
to replant vineyards with the better clones of Pinot Noir, which may account 
for a measure of the better quality of the more recent vintages. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Gladden, who staged this event for Martin Wine Cellars, noted that a 
number of Burgundy producers have made strides to create classic wines again, 
including Pierre Bouree, Domaine Dujac and "one we've been happy with, Jean 
Gros. The intensity of his wines is very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Another exciting element of this event was a tasting of the last 11 vintages of 
Salon Champagne. Salon is made only in great vintages -- in the last 60 years 
only 20 vintages have been made -- and these dated to 1948. The older Salon 
Champagnes showed well, especially the amazing 1976 and 1979, and the 
astounding 1969 and 1964. The intensity of the fruit of these all-Chardonnay 
sparkling wines was heady, the tastes rich and layered with complexity. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess this answers those folks who say Champagne doesn't age well," said 
Overton. 
</P>
<P>
Overton said the elegant 1982 Salon, the current release, followed in the 
footsteps of prior vintages and needed another few years to become as great as 
its older cousins. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, when a couple of the Salons had lost all their bubbles, the wine that 
remained was marvelous. (I asked myself, "Who needs bubbles if the wine 
underneath is this well made?") 
</P>
<P>
The best red wine of the tasting? There was no consensus in the room, although 
everyone felt the 1945 Corton Renardes from Doudet-Naudin was amazingly fresh 
and round with intense fruit, but I also gave perfect scores to two 1959s and a 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
The amazing thing was that every wine was superb, nothing was considered a 
clunker or an "off bottle." 
</P>
<P>
Summing it up, well past midnight, Overton said, "If you study Claret 
(Bordeaux) and study Burgundy, you realize you have to open a lot more Burgundy 
to do a function like this." 
</P>
<P>
Flatt agreed: "It's harder to do a tasting like this than any Bordeaux event," 
because of the scarcity of such great wines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1988 Hanna Sauvignon Blanc ($8.75) -- Wonderful spicy lemon-grass and melon 
aromas with a trace of fresh figs and vanilla make this wine a most complex 
offering. The entry is almost sweet, and the richness on the palate -- due to 
13.5% alcohol and oak aging -- complete the package. Hanna has made some 
excellent Sauvignon Blancs and this may be the best yet.

Photo, SCLERODERMA BENEFIT -- While high-energy paparazzi waited outside City 
Restaurant Monday night to focus their cameras on arriving celebrities such as 
Linda Gray, Leslie Ann Warren and Sally Struthers, inside supporters of 
Scleroderma, a disease affecting body tissue, sat down to dinner. The fund 
raising event, "Cool Comedy Hot Cuisine" began with exotic potato bhujia 
(cakes) with mint chutney and yogurt, went on to marinated tuna with seaweed 
and ginger, braised duck with Thai red curry and basmati rice, and ended with 
good old American German chocolate cake with coconut ice cream. Guests began 
the evening at the adjacent Jan Baum Gallery with a selection of appetizers and 
California wines and champagnes. City restaurant chef-owners Susan Feniger, 
left, and Mary Sue Milliken, show off samples of the appetizers, including, 
lamb loin on naan with skordalia, pate on black bread, citrus gravlax on corn 
blinis, Vietnamese marinated mussels on skewers with orange, mint and cilantro 
leaves, and oysters with shallot and tomatillo sauces. Food, wine and services 
of City restaurant staff, comedic entertainment by Richard Belzer, Ellen 
deGeneres, Paul Provenza and Reno, and music by the Freeway Philharmonic band 
were donated. ELLEN JASKOL / Los Angeles Times

It looks like cauliflower dyed green. 
</P>
<P>
It has a pleasing taste, sweeter than cauliflower, milder than broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called Broccoflower. It's a cross between cauliflower and broccoli and is 
America's newest vegetable," Joseph Montecalvo explained. 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo recently completed several weeks of nutritional tests on the plant. 
He heads up the food science and nutrition department of California Polytechnic 
State University here. 
</P>
<P>
"It has more Vitamin C than oranges," Montecalvo said. "And it's high in folic 
acid, which is important to the maintenance of red blood cells carrying oxygen 
through the human body." 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo conducted the nutritional profile at the request of Rick Antle, 
president of Tanimura and Antle Co., headquartered in Salinas. The produce firm 
has 20,000 acres in lettuce, broccoli and cauliflower in Salinas, the San 
Joaquin Valley, Yuma, and Obregon, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Antle, 33, a fourth-generation California grower and 1979 Cal Poly graduate, is 
a member of the school's crop science advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
In October 1988 Antle sent a few cases of Broccoflower to his customers on a 
trial basis. Now his company is shipping 20,000 to 25,000 boxes a week (12 to 
16 heads to a box) throughout the country and Canada. Broccoflower sells for 
about the same price as cauliflower. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a major grower of both cauliflower and broccoli. Wild crosses occur 
between the two crops. About 10 years ago we began breeding the two vegetables 
on an experimental basis," Antle recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't do much with it. Then, on a trip to Europe three years ago he 
discovered seeds for a cauliflower-broccoli cross at a seed company in Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought some of the seed, planted it in Salinas, liked what I saw and then 
bought as much of the seed as was available from the Holland seed company. I 
learned that the plant was grown commercially on a small scale in Europe, but 
in all my travels I had never seen it in this country," Antle said. 
</P>
<P>
The seed was expensive -- $1,500-a-pound. "But I knew I was onto something. 
Growers are always looking for a new crop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Antle called the vegetable Broccoflower and has taken out a trademark 
application on the name. He sells the product to his regular customers, who are 
located for the most part along the Eastern Seaboard. About 10% of his 
production of Broccoflower is distributed in California. It has been sold in a 
few markets in Southern California the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"It has really caught on. The demand far exceeds the supply so far. Last year 
we were growing Broccoflower on 300 acres. This year we are increasing the 
acreage considerably," Antle noted. He said many other growers are now doing 
test trials on the crop. 
</P>
<P>
"Broccoflower is the talk of the vegetable commodity industry. There is an 
obvious niche for it in the market. And everybody's trying to get on the 
bandwagon. We feel fortunate because we've got a head start," he added. 
</P>
<P>
He said the first big public display of Broccoflower will take place at the 
Food Marketing Institute Trade Show in Chicago the first week in May. 
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 Broccoflower plants donated to Cal Poly's crop science department 
were planted on the San Luis Obispo campus April 21 by James Greil, professor 
at the school's crop science department, and four agriculture students. 
</P>
<P>
"The plantings are part of Cal Poly's enterprise program underwritten by the 
Cal Poly Foundation. Students involved will earn 67% of the profits from the 
crop toward their education, with 33% of the profits returned to the 
foundation," Greil explained. 
</P>
<P>
Both the grower and the students benefit as students will be doing continuous 
research on the new crop under Greil's direction. 
</P>
<P>
During the height of President George Bush's broccoli brouhaha, George Gowgani, 
head of Cal Poly's crop science department, shipped a case of Broccoflower to 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a thank you note from a member of the White House staff and were 
informed that Broccoflower was served raw as a dip at two receptions attended 
by President Bush. But, we don't know whether the President tried it. Of 
course, we hope he did and hope he liked it," Gowgani said.

THE STARS COME OUT AT MICHELIN; 
</P>
<P>
GOURMET: EUROPE'S TOP-SELLING GUIDE, WITH ITS CORPS OF GASTRONOMIC SLEUTHS, CAN 
BRING RICHES OR RUIN TO A RESTAURANT.

<P>
Their comments can provoke ruin -- even suicide. These are the Michelin men, 
whose taste buds are trained to uphold the highest standards of French 
gastronomy. Their job is as lonely as a spy's. 
</P>
<P>
"Having Michelin stars is like having a sword of Damocles over your head," said 
a slightly soured Jean-Andre Charial, the only three-star chef demoted in this 
year's edition of the Michelin guide. He was finding it hard to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
"Having stars means constant tension, being obsessed with food, never leaving 
the kitchen, never seeing friends or family," he said. "Then they go and take 
one away." 
</P>
<P>
Michelin didn't tell Charial exactly why L'Oustau de Baumaniere, in southern 
France, lost one of the stars first won 35 years ago by his grandfather, 
Raymond Thuillier, who at the age of 94 still hovers in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it would give us publicity," Charial said. "The worst is: They were 
right." 
</P>
<P>
The thick, red guide has gone a long way since its launch by the Michelin tire 
company in 1900 as an aid to the intrepid drivers of the world's first 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Distributed free of charge, it listed bakeries and hardware stores that sold 
gasoline, gave a recipe for a home-made eye ointment to combat the effects of 
dust and discussed the trouble caused by horseshoe nails littering the roads. 
</P>
<P>
With 650,000 copies now sold each year, it is Europe's top-selling guide as 
well as the traveler's bible on the finest restaurants and hotels of France and 
of some of its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But how the book, which now runs to 1,200-pages, awards its stars and selects 
its prime establishments is a secret Michelin enjoys cultivating. 
</P>
<P>
"Discretion is part of the company ethic," Bernard Naegellen, director of the 
famed guides, told Reuters. "Why should we reveal our trade secrets? What would 
be the point? 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that matters to us is to keep our readers happy by producing an 
excellent guide." 
</P>
<P>
Naegellen, a soft-spoken hotel school graduate of about 50, made clear that, 
while he had agreed to a rare interview, there was absolutely no chance of 
meeting one of Michelin's legendary inspectors -- a corps of secret sleuths 
whose identity is about as well protected as that of a spy. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes seven or eight years for an inspector to cover the whole of France," 
Naegellen said in explaining how the identities are kept secret. "By the time 
he returns to his point of departure, people have forgotten his face." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men whose persnickety tastes can bring ruin, riches or even suicide 
-- as in the case of one restaurateur who lost his star in the 1960s -- are 
hotel school graduates with 10 years professional experience, Naegellen said. 
</P>
<P>
"They must be robust enough to cope with the many meals, fired by passion and 
not be afraid of solitude." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their lonely crusades across the land in quest of "that extra-special, 
out-of-the-way gem of a place," as Naegellen put it, the Michelin tasters get 
no perks. 
</P>
<P>
"We never reimburse liqueurs or aperitifs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for their probity, one of Michelin's proudest qualities, new recruits are 
scrutinized during months of training. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes without saying that our inspectors are honest," he said. "Our 
reputation is such, however, that no French restaurateur or hotel-keeper would 
ever dream of paying a bribe or even offering a free meal or drink. We always 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
But how does Michelin give and take away its prized stars? What does it take to 
be in the top league of 19 three-star restaurants? 
</P>
<P>
Naegellen explained that the 600-odd restaurants awarded a star -- along with 
potential candidates -- are visited incognito every 12 to 18 months, at least 
once but sometimes several times by a different inspector. 
</P>
<P>
"They often don't even know we've been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the same time span, another of his food sleuths will call, eat, pay the 
bill, then show his card for an on-the-record chat about the owner's plans for 
brightening the decor or the food. 
</P>
<P>
Notes are carefully compared at lengthy meetings in the Paris headquarters and 
a final decision taken collectively. 
</P>
<P>
"What we look for is regularity. The food must be perfect all year-round, any 
time, because the bill is always the same," Naegellen said. 
</P>
<P>
"A three-star will stand out because of the finesse of the cooking, the quality 
of its products and the savoir-faire of the chef." 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 more mundane hotels and non-star restaurants get an official visit 
about every 18 months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep abundant files on restaurants. If there is a unanimous feeling about a 
place, we take a decision, but it can take several years." 
</P>
<P>
Although critics have questioned whether Michelin has enough inspectors to keep 
tabs on so many establishments, Naegellen refused to confirm popular rumors he 
had no more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
He likewise shrugged off queries on Michelin's often contested choices, such as 
why Tour d'Argent in Paris -- not a gourmet favorite -- was still among the 
heady top 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We can feel whether a place is on the slide or on the up and up. We have a 
long tradition behind us, a special savoir-faire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the guide put a lot of stock in letters it receives from its 
readers -- up to 300 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, what was his favorite restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
"I won't tell you that either," he laughed. "I believe a restaurant is a little 
like the theater -- a place where you can set the stage according to your mood. 
</P>
<P>
"A grand three-star restaurant will be ideal for a birthday, a small bistro for 
a friendly chat."

San Diego County's population topped 2.5 million as the county gained 92,300 
residents during 1989, according to state estimates released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Finance population estimates show that 2,509,900 people were 
living in the county as of January, up 3.8% from the previous January's 
2,417,600. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest share of the newcomers -- either through birth or relocation -- 
went to the city of San Diego, which added 30,500 residents. The San Diego city 
population is now 1,118,300, the estimates say. 
</P>
<P>
Rural and unincorporated areas of the county now have 414,600 residents, 
reflecting a gain of 23,400. Unincorporated areas now account for 16% of the 
county's population. 
</P>
<P>
After San Diego, cities with the biggest growth were Escondido (5,400), Chula 
Vista (3,700), San Marcos (3,200), and Encinitas (2,000). Among the cities with 
the least growth were Solana Beach (50), National City (200), and El Cajon 
(200). 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the state's population increased from 29.7 million to 29.47 million, 
or 2.7%. The gain of 772,000 people was the largest annual increase since the 
state's beginning.

U.S. BORDER PATROL SUSPENDS AGENTS FOR RACIAL TAUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three U. S. Border Patrol agents, including a supervisor, were suspended 
without pay for their roles in an incident last summer when an officer taunted 
hundreds of Mexican migrants with racial and sexual slurs amplified over his 
vehicle's public address system, an official confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The statement Wednesday by Ted A. Swofford, spokesman for the U.S. Border 
Patrol in San Diego, was the first official acknowledgement that the incident 
had occurred, although it was witnessed by three U. S. journalists, including a 
Times reporter, and was widely reported in the press. 
</P>
<P>
The three agents, who were not identified, all served their suspensions within 
the past two months and are back on the force, said Swofford. He described the 
disciplinary action as severe. 
</P>
<P>
Citing privacy concerns, Swofford did not identify the offending agents. He 
also would not elaborate on the terms of the suspensions, other than to 
characterize them as "substantial." One knowledgeable official said two weeks 
was a likely term for the suspension of the supervisor, although that could not 
be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Agents charged with administrative violations can face a range of penalties, 
from verbal reprimands to firings, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
"The patrol's feeling is that we are a professional organization and we pride 
ourselves on that," Swofford said. "Any activity that is not professional will 
not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, news of the broadcast slurs drew angry responses from Latino 
groups, who cited the actions as evidence that U.S. agents were provoking 
violence along the border. Less than two hours after the taunts were broadcast, 
a Border Patrol agent posted near the same area shot and wounded a 15-year-old 
Mexican boy, who agents said was about to hurl a rock at another agent. 
</P>
<P>
The taunts occurred on the evening of Aug. 27 along the banks of the Tijuana 
River, a principal crossing point for undocumented immigrants. That evening, 
hundreds of border-crossers had gathered along the border fence and atop the 
river's southern levee, waiting for an opportunity to slip farther into U. S. 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
The agent spoke from a Border Patrol vehicle parked at the bottom of the mostly 
dry Tijuana River channel, about 250 yards north of the waiting migrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Your mothers are all whores!" the agent said over the loudspeaker, speaking 
crude border Spanish and occasionally punctuating his comments with a cackling 
laugh and tapes of Mexican music. "All Mexicans are whores!" 
</P>
<P>
The agent continued with a series of crude and sexually explicit comments. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts provoked incensed responses from the massed migrants, who hurled 
insults back. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear if more than one agent had been involved in the actual taunts, 
or if the others had only abetted the effort. 
</P>
<P>
The taunting continued for at least an hour. Migrants interviewed at the time 
said such broadcasts are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford, the Border Patrol spokesman, said he had never heard of a similar 
incident.

VISTA'S DEBATES TOBACCO BAN FOR MINORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vista City Council had a lukewarm reception Wednesday for a proposal to 
make illegal the possession of cigarettes and other tobacco products by minors, 
and decided to ask for further input from the public before taking action. 
</P>
<P>
"It needs more investigation, obviously," Councilwoman Nancy Wade said at the 
meeting. "I just think we're getting so restrictive on everything. I certainly 
don't want youngsters to smoke . . . but, at the same time, I just find that it 
is getting to be a very restrictive life." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gene Asmus disagreed, saying, "When you're dealing with minors, I 
think you've got to be a little more restrictive and tell them what the rules 
are." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to ban possession of cigarettes and other tobacco products by 
persons under the age of 18 is the first of its kind in California, according 
to Rick Dudley, senior management analyst for the city and author of the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be a real pro-active thing, it's going to be more of a tool 
that juvenile officers would use," Dudley said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would also ban cigarette vending machines in areas accessible to 
minors, including gas stations, restaurants and entertainment centers. In 
November, Duarte became the first city in California to pass such a law, which 
went into effect April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Vista's proposal arose from the city's Crime and Substance Abuse Prevention 
Commission as a way of denying minors access to "gateway drugs" such as 
cigarettes that may lead to dependency on other, "harder" drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicotine is a gateway drug and it leads to other drugs," said Detective Carmen 
Martinez of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. "A youngster's body is 
not fully developed. . . . An adult's body can handle it much better than a 
juvenile's, especially before the age of 15." 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to minors, but 
possession of those products by youths under 18 is not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry opposes the law because of the potential for police 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is going to enforce this? Does that mean if a police officer sees a 
young-looking person with a cigarette, he can detain that person? This law may 
have the police burden without getting the job done," said Thomas Lauria, a 
spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Tobacco Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"While none of us want kids to smoke, what precedents are being set? People are 
using kids to get at adults." 
</P>
<P>
Lauria said the law does not get to the heart of the problem and that focusing 
on peer pressure and role models would be more effective in preventing kids 
from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal received strong support from the Sheriff's Department, which sees 
it as a tool for officers dealing with juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
"We would use it as another lever to get kids away from illegal substances," 
Sheriff's Lt. Scott McClintock said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock said the proposed ordinance would be used in the same way the state 
uses the seat-belt law: a person would be cited only when found in violation of 
another, more serious offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't specifically go out and target kids with cigarettes," McClintock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Possession of tobacco by a minor under the proposed law would be an infraction 
of a city ordinance, and the minor would be subject to a fine. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Hinojosa, manager of the Vista Entertainment Center, the city's only 
bowling alley, said his establishment would have no difficulty complying with 
the ordinance if it were to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"In the event that they ask us to remove the vending machines from the underage 
children, we can always put them in the lounge, where only adults are allowed," 
Hinojosa said. 
</P>
<P>
Hinojosa said the center has long had a policy prohibiting minors from smoking 
inside the building, and it has not been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
In Duarte, only two business owners have complained about the ordinance, saying 
their customers have lost the convenience of buying cigarettes at their 
establishments, said Manuel Ontal, assistant to the city manager.

FUGITIVE HELD IN TIJUANA WRITER'S DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE EX-SECURITY CHIEF AT CALIENTE RACETRACK, CAPTURED IN L.A., IS BACK 
IN MEXICO TO FACE CHARGES IN THE SLAYING OF THE COLUMNIST KNOWN AS EL GATO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A central suspect in the sensational slaying two years ago of Hector Felix 
Miranda, a prominent Tijuana journalist widely known as El Gato, or the Cat, 
was in the custody of Mexican authorities Wednesday after his arrest by Los 
Angeles authorities this week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Vera Palestina, former chief of security at Tijuana's Caliente 
Racetrack, was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon as he arrived near the 
Greyhound bus terminal in downtown Los Angeles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police and U.S. immigration officers arrested the longtime fugitive 
after receiving a tip from Baja California authorities, who have been 
investigating the journalist's April, 1988, slaying. Vera went to the station 
to meet a friend, according to a statement by the Los Angeles Police 
Department, which set up surveillance at the site. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Vera, a former police officer in Mexico City, was in the United 
States illegally and was consequently turned over to U.S. immigration 
authorities. On Tuesday evening, he was returned to the U.S.-Mexico border, 
where he was turned over to state police agents and jailed in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest culminates two years of doubt and intrigue surrounding the slaying, 
which became a heated political issue in Baja California, testing the Mexican 
government's stated commitment to a free press. 
</P>
<P>
Felix was one of two dozen journalists killed in the six-year term of former 
Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid. Most of the slayings remain unsolved, 
according to Mexican journalism groups. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, 47, was killed on April 20, 1988, as he drove to work down a 
rain-slicked street in Tijuana. A vehicle blocked his path, and an assassin 
pumped two rounds from a 12-gauge shotgun through the driver's window of his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants had observed his path to and from work and waited for him at the 
assassination spot, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Felix's killing sparked anti-government protests and large-scale mourning in 
Tijuana, his adopted city. 
</P>
<P>
The perception that authorities were covering up Felix's slaying was widely 
credited with contributing to the decisive electoral victory last year of 
opposition Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the first-ever opposition governor in 
modern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only a first step, but it is a very important one," said J. Jesus 
Blancornelas, Felix's longtime colleague and co-worker, after news of Vera's 
arrest. "From here comes the most difficult part," he added, referring to the 
upcoming court proceedings against Vera. 
</P>
<P>
Although grateful for Vera's arrest, Blancornelas said during a Wednesday night 
press conference that he believes the masterminds of the killing are still at 
large. He voiced the hope that Vera's arrest will finally resolve the mystery 
surrounding his colleague's death. 
</P>
<P>
Blancornelas and Felix founded the muckraking weekly Zeta, in which Felix's 
pointed barbs appeared in a must-read column called Un Poco de Algo (A Little 
of Something). Felix, using a telltale combination of puns, double meanings, 
crude words and other verbal stunts, regularly took shots at a wide range of 
public officials in Baja. His titillating, gossipy missives were savored by the 
powerful and powerless alike. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Blancornelas, probably the most prominent journalist in 
Tijuana, has repeatedly used his publication to demand a thorough investigation 
into his colleague's killing. He has reprinted old columns by Felix and 
featured full-page, black-bordered advertisements asking three successive Baja 
California governors what they planned to do with the case. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly Zeta, under Blancornelas' direction, has pointed its finger directly 
at Jorge Hank Rhon, the president of the Caliente Racetrack, who employed Vera. 
</P>
<P>
Vera was also the longtime personal bodyguard for Hank, who is the scion of a 
wealthy and influential Mexico City family. Hank, the race track owner, was an 
acquaintance of the slain journalist but toward the end of the journalist's 
life, Hank emerged as a frequent target in Felix's column. 
</P>
<P>
Hank has repeatedly denied any involvement in the case. His father, Jorge Hank 
Gonzalez, former mayor of Mexico City and now Mexico's minister of agriculture 
and water resources, a cabinet-level post, has also publicly denied that his 
son played any role in the slaying, or that any cover-up was perpetuated to 
protect his son. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Baja California Gov. Ruffo held a press conference in the state 
capital of Mexicali to announce the arrest. During the campaign, Ruffo, 
standard-bearer of Mexico's opposition National Action Party, had vowed to 
pursue the case and clear up the unsolved slaying, a promise that he repeated 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation will be pursued to its ultimate consequences, no matter who 
is involved," a statement from the governor's office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vera, who authorities said was living in El Monte, east of Los Angeles, was 
arrested without incident. He had been sought since the killing, and sightings 
of Vera had been reported everywhere from San Diego to Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Vera appeared before Baja California State Judge Miguel Angel Barud on 
Wednesday and, at a preliminary hearing, denied the charges against him. The 
judge has 72 hours to determine whether there is sufficient proof to retain 
Vera in custody, something that is considered a virtual certainty considering 
the wealth of evidence garnered during the two years since an arrest order was 
issued for Vera. 
</P>
<P>
Vera could face up to 30 years in jail on the murder charge. The suspect, 
sporting a beard, was led into the courtroom in handcuffs, under tight 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Victoriano Medina Moreno, a former security guard at the race track, was 
convicted last August of being the triggerman in the slaying. He is serving a 
27-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
However, Blancornelas, the slain columnist's longtime colleague, has argued in 
print that Vera was the actual triggerman and that Medina only drove the 
getaway vehicle. Blancornelas and other journalists have said that Medina, 
although sharing responsibility, was being offered up as a scapegoat for the 
entire murder scheme -- an allegation denied by Baja authorities. Medina 
himself contended that he was tortured into making a confession. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities never presented an adequate explanation as to why they 
believe Vera and Medina killed Felix. Officials said one of his columns cost 
Medina his former job, but Felix's former colleagues said neither Medina's or 
Vera's names ever appeared in any of Felix's columns.

LANDMARK STATUS REJECTED FOR VAN NUYS AIRPORT HANGARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city panel voted Wednesday not to designate two World War II-vintage hangars 
at Van Nuys Airport as cultural-historic landmarks, clearing the way for 
redeveloping a 38-acre parcel at the city-owned facility. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-2 vote, the Cultural Heritage Commission declined to issue a protective 
designation sought by Volpar Aircraft Corp. President A. E. Saava, a Canoga 
Park resident. The parcel on which the 126,000-square-foot hangars sit is 
leased by Saava's firm from the Los Angeles Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
Hangars 901 and 902 were built in 1943 by Lockheed Corp. for the manufacture of 
B-24 Liberator bombers, one of the aviation workhorses of World War II. A 1979 
publication by the airports department identified the hangars as having a 
"whole bunch of history." 
</P>
<P>
John Malloy, city airport real estate agent, said the heritage board's action 
will enable the department to raze the hangars and remove underground hazardous 
waste storage facilities on the property as a prelude to leasing the land to a 
private developer. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been leasing the land and the hangars to Volpar for more than 
$875,000 per year. Malloy said a new tenant, operating under a permit to 
redevelop the property, would pay up to $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Groundbreaking for a redevelopment project can be expected within a year, 
Malloy said. Developer bids are being solicited. 
</P>
<P>
At a prior board meeting, city officials had accused Saava of seeking landmark 
status only as a ploy to salvage his company's lease. The designation would 
have protected the hangars from destruction for a year. 
</P>
<P>
During his testimony before the board, Malloy said he had surveyed other Van 
Nuys Airport tenants and pilots about Saava's proposal. To his surprise, Malloy 
said, he found that many had the "mistaken belief" that the department's grand 
plan calls for transforming the airport into an industrial park and that 
designating the hangars as official landmarks would help preserve aviation uses 
at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Malloy said the department plans to reserve 10 acres of the site for general 
aviation purposes. The remaining land could be used for any purpose, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural heritage board chairman Armajit Marwah said he found no cultural or 
historic significance to the hangars. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Harold Becks argued that blocking or stalling airport 
redevelopment plans would unnecessarily burden taxpayers after Malloy testified 
that redevelopment would double the city's income from the property. 
</P>
<P>
But San Fernando Valley board member Helen Madrid-Worthen sided with Saava, 
saying the hangars had housed many aircraft-manufacturing enterprises, 
including a maintenance facility for the U-2 spy plane, and thus were the scene 
of important elements of the Valley's industrial growth. 
</P>
<P>
Saava told the heritage board that Volpar will soon move from Hangers 901 and 
902 to another part of the airport, subleasing a site from another tenant. The 
sublease is subject to airport department approval.

POLICE ROUTINELY RELOCATE TRANSIENTS, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police officers, under pressure from downtown merchants, often pick 
up transients and relocate them to remote areas, an attorney for one of two 
officers charged with kidnaping and robbing illegal aliens said in court 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
James Gattey, an attorney with the Police Officers Assn., said Officers Lloyd 
J. Hoff and Richard P. Schaaf were simply following general police practices 
when they removed transients from the downtown and are not guilty of kidnaping 
and robbing a small group of undocumented Latino workers last August. 
</P>
<P>
"They will locate them to areas that they know they will stay," he said in his 
opening remarks at the trial in San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a practice," Gattey said. "There is not an official sanction. It's not 
something you read about. It's employed and has been employed by San Diego 
police for many years. It is a common police practice." 
</P>
<P>
However, his contention that the Police Department condones such a policy drew 
ire from at least one civil rights and Latino activist, who called the practice 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"Those policies are racist, and it's the manifestation of selective law 
enforcement on the part of the San Diego Police Department," Herman Baca, 
chairman of the Committee on Chicano Rights, said in a telephone interview 
after Wednesday's court proceedings. "It's standard policy and has been for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
Hoff, 27, and Schaaf, 29, both on voluntary leave from the department, face 
maximum sentences of life in prison if convicted on the felony charges. They 
are accused of kidnaping three illegal aliens for the purpose of robbery, and 
of robbing two of the men. 
</P>
<P>
But Gattey, who represents Hoff, told the jury that "nobody was transporting 
anybody for the purpose of robbery." 
</P>
<P>
With crowded jails and complaining shopkeepers, Gattey said, officers working 
the downtown beat often face a dilemma in dealing with known troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
"What do they do in response to the department's saying we have got to get 
these people out of here?" Gattey asked the jury. "What do we do? They will 
locate them to other areas." 
</P>
<P>
However, one of the plaintiffs, Arturo Romero Garcia, testified that Hoff and 
Schaaf took him from a downtown trolley stop, stole $35 in cash from his 
wallet, and abandoned him in a dark, isolated area near railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who is in jail for auto burglary, has given police a variety of 
pseudonyms and birth dates on various occasions, and he admitted during a 
preliminary hearing that he was once a heavy heroin user. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Carrera Reyes, an undocumented worker, is expected to testify today 
that the two officers, in separate incidents, took him from downtown, robbed 
him and dropped him off in a remote area. Like Garcia, he has a criminal record 
and was arrested at the preliminary hearing on six outstanding warrants, 
including one for possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing, Carrera Reyes testified that Hoff struck him 
several times in the testicles with his flashlight, tossed his shoes in a 
puddle and then pushed him into the water. Another alleged victim, Ramiro 
Rodriguez, has not been located. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Bobbitt, the attorney for Schaaf, did not give an opening statement. 
But he has objected to Schaaf's involvement in the proceedings, saying that no 
one testified against his client during the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and Carrera Reyes claim that Hoff was the key perpetrator. 
</P>
<P>
But Gattey cited discrepancies in the accounts given by Garcia and Carrera 
Reyes: The amounts of money they said was stolen has changed on different 
occasions, and they have given conflicting birth dates and places of birth.

LANCASTER SHIFTS 2 CAMPUSES TO ALL-YEAR PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: THE MOVE IS AIMED AT SEEKING RELIEF FROM CROWDED CLASSROOMS IN THE 
10,000-STUDENT ANTELOPE VALLEY DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lancaster School District, seeking relief from crowded classrooms, has 
decided to begin moving toward a year-round calendar by converting two of its 
14 campuses to the controversial schedule this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The change will mean an early end to summer vacation for students at Lincoln 
and Nancy Cory elementary schools, both of which opened last fall. Year-round 
classes there will begin Aug. 6, about a month ahead of other schools in the 
10,800-student district. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to approve the switch, which 
will expand the enrollment capacity of the two schools. Parents will have the 
choice of keeping children in those schools or transferring them to schools 
with traditional calendars. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster's switch to a year-round calendar is the latest in a series of such 
moves by school districts in the fast-growing Antelope Valley, which are faced 
with spiraling enrollments but little money to build new classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The topic of year-round classes has been controversial in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, which is turning to such a schedule to relieve 
crowding. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster's year-round calendar, like some of those that have brought 
objections from parents in Los Angeles schools, has no common summer vacation 
period for all students. But Lancaster officials said most parents have 
supported the switch thus far. 
</P>
<P>
"There are parents who want their kids to go year-round. It's more 
educationally sound," said Alyce Ellis, principal of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say year-round programs help students retain what they learn 
because they are not out of class for three months during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster district's year-round schedule is expected to increase the 
capacity of the two schools by about 33% because students will be divided into 
four groups -- called tracks -- and at any given time, one of the groups will 
be on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Each group will have three 60-day school periods broken up by three 20-day 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment at the two schools is expected to climb from about 750 students each 
to as many as 1,000 next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Students already attending the two schools will get priority to re-enroll. 
District officials hope that transfers from other schools, students whose 
parents want them in a year-round program, will ease crowding at the other 
schools. School officials promised to try to keep brothers and sisters on the 
same tracks to avoid splitting their vacations. 
</P>
<P>
The neighboring Palmdale School District already has one year-round school and 
plans to add two more this fall, but Palmdale's schedule keeps July as a common 
vacation month for all. Antelope Valley high school officials are considering 
converting at least one campus to a year-round calendar by the fall of 1991.

WARRANT ISSUED FOR 'CHEERS' ACTOR OVER MISSED COURT DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Kelsey Grammer, who was slapped with arrest warrants twice previously in 
connection with a 1988 drunk-driving conviction, was again ordered arrested 
Wednesday after he missed a court appearance in Van Nuys on an unrelated drug 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer, 35, who plays the brainy psychiatrist Frasier Crane in the "Cheers" 
television series, was scheduled to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court to prove 
he was participating in a drug rehabilitation program offered as an alternative 
to standing trial after his arrest for cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys resident did not enroll in the program, according to a probation 
report prepared for Wednesday's hearing. Grammer had requested that he be 
placed in the program to avoid trial on the charge, which carries a maximum 
sentence of three years in prison, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a foolish error" not to have taken part in the program, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Andrew W. Diamond said. "This is a good program for first offenders, for 
people who want to clean up their lives without a criminal conviction." 
</P>
<P>
Grammer was driving east on Riverside Drive near Whitsett Avenue on April 14, 
1988, when he was pulled over by police because his license plate tags had 
expired, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The actor was arrested on the drug charge after a packet containing about a 
quarter of a gram of cocaine worth about $25 fell from his pocket as he sat in 
a patrol car on the way to the police station, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Judge Aviva K. Bobb denied a request by Grammer's attorney, 
Robert L. Diamond, to suspend the bench warrant until his client returns to Los 
Angeles from a trip. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer, who had been free on his own recognizance, was also ordered to post 
the $7,500 bail set after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Grammer missed a court appearance on the drug 
charge. He showed up two days late in October for a hearing on whether he 
should be allowed to participate in the drug program. Diamond said at the time 
that his client was confused about the date of the hearing and on whether he 
had to be present. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same thing he did last time," Bobb said Wednesday. "I see no reason 
to revoke the bench warrant this time." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond said he did not know where his client was. He said Grammer might have 
failed to enroll in the drug program because he believed his attendance at an 
alcoholic rehabilitation program -- ordered after his drunk-driving conviction 
-- also met the requirements of the drug program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to missing the two drug charge hearings, Grammer failed to attend 
two hearings after his arrest in 1987 for drunk driving, court records show. 
Bench warrants for his arrest were issued after each absence. The first warrant 
was withdrawn after he posted $1,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent warrant in that case was issued Feb. 6 after Grammer missed a 
hearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court to show that he had completed 10 days of 
community service and had graduated from the three-month alcohol program. The 
warrant is still in effect, court records showed. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 10, 1989, Municipal Judge Lloyd Nash ordered Grammer to perform the 
community service as a penalty for failing to show up in court to prove that he 
was enrolled in the alcohol rehabilitation program, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer was arrested July 17, 1987, after Los Angeles police officers saw his 
Cadillac weaving on Fulton Avenue in Van Nuys. His blood-alcohol level, tested 
after his arrest, was 0.18% -- nearly twice the 0.1% legal definition of 
drunkenness in effect at the time, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer pleaded no contest to drunk driving on July 13, 1988, and was sentenced 
to three years probation. He was also ordered to pay a $390 fine and attend the 
alcohol program.

'ONION FIELD' KILLER JIMMY SMITH ARRESTED IN ASSAULT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE PAROLEE IS ACCUSED OF THREATENING A MAN WITH A KNIFE. HE SERVED 19 
YEARS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE 1963 SLAYING OF OFFICER IAN CAMPBELL.

<P>
Paroled "Onion Field" police killer Jimmy Lee Smith was arrested in Van Nuys 
after he allegedly threatened a man with a butcher knife, Los Angeles police 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 59, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, 
two weeks after a man complained that Smith had threatened him, Lt. Warren 
Knowles said. Smith, who police said was under the influence of heroin at the 
time of his arrest, was held without bail because the arrest violates 
conditions of his parole. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of arrests for Smith since he was paroled in 
February, 1982, after serving 19 years in prison for his role in the March, 
1963, slaying of Los Angeles Police Officer Ian Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and his partner, Officer Karl Hettinger, were abducted in Hollywood by 
Smith and Gregory Powell and driven to an onion field south of Bakersfield. 
Powell killed Campbell and shot at Hettinger, who escaped in the darkness. The 
crime and ensuing trial were recounted in Joseph Wambaugh's best-selling 1973 
novel "The Onion Field," which was made into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Since his parole eight years ago, Smith has been arrested five times, three 
times on drug charges. He was convicted of selling heroin in 1984, and he was 
returned to prison three times, for periods ranging from six months to a year, 
for violating his parole. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the latest arrest followed a dispute between Smith and his former 
roommate, Marcia Peltier, 49, of Van Nuys, who had ordered him to move out of 
her apartment in early April. 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said that on April 17 Peltier found all four of the tires on her car 
flat and later confronted Smith, who threatened her. The following day, when 
Peltier approached the car with a friend, Dana Ruvolo, 37, of Van Nuys, they 
saw Smith standing next to it, Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
"They challenged him on what he was doing there," Knowles said. "He pulled a 
rather large butcher knife from his waistband and lunged at Ruvolo." 
</P>
<P>
Ruvolo picked up a brick to defend himself. Smith backed off and fled, Knowles 
said. A police report was taken on the incident and Powell was arrested Tuesday 
when patrol officers who knew him from previous encounters saw him on Zombar 
Avenue near Saticoy Street. 
</P>
<P>
Powell and Smith were twice sentenced to death for the police killing, but the 
sentences were reduced to life in prison when the state Supreme Court ruled the 
death penalty unconstitutional. Powell is still serving a life sentence.

MUNOZ QUITS AS DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irma Munoz, whose chairmanship of the San Diego County Democratic Party saw the 
party strengthen its ties with organized labor and smooth relations with its 
elected officials, announced her resignation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, a self-described "take-charge lady" guided by what she characterized as 
a "big-umbrella approach" in her attempts to broaden the local party's base, 
said she decided to step down in order to concentrate on her job as chief of 
staff to Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Chacon faces a strong challenge in the June 5 Democratic primary from former 
San Diego City Councilwoman Celia Ballesteros, and Munoz said that, by stepping 
down now -- rather than next month, when a new county Central Committee will be 
elected -- she hopes to avoid accusations that partisanship might influence her 
actions as party leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I am involved on a daily basis with dozens of community groups," Munoz said. 
"That work is important to me and to Assemblyman Chacon, and I don't want it to 
be subject to campaign-based accusations that I am involved with it for 
partisan purposes. I've enjoyed this time of service, but it is clearly time to 
move on." 
</P>
<P>
As highlights of her nearly four-year tenure, Munoz cited a "stronger working 
relationship" with organized labor -- historically, one of the party's most 
significant allies -- and voter registration drives aimed at "providing 
political empowerment to communities of color." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Munoz's position on Chacon's staff enhanced her role as a liaison 
between the local party apparatus and Democratic elected officials, easing 
tensions that stem largely from each group's belief that the other does not 
understand its needs or do enough to accomplish mutual goals. 
</P>
<P>
"She made the party a more vital force," said political consultant Larry Remer. 
"Perhaps not as vital as I and some others would like, but there was definite 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz fell short, however, of the voter registration targets she identified as 
her top priority when she took office in July, 1986, when local Republicans had 
surpassed the Democrats in registration within the city of San Diego for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Democrats now hold a slim registration lead within the city -- 43.3% 
to 43% -- the party's countywide position slipped during the past four years. 
Over that period, the Republican edge in countywide registration widened from 
5.9 percentage points to the current 8.3 points, 47.3% to 39%, according to 
figures from the county registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Another disappointment, Munoz conceded, involves the local party's failure to 
significantly improve its candidate development program. In next month's 
primary, for example, there will be no Democrats on the ballot in two local 
congressional districts and one state Senate district held by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to attract candidates to run in a strong, 
Republican-dominated county," Munoz said. But it probably will require an 
infusion of money and other resources from the state party, she added, for that 
to begin to change. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Munoz's resignation, the local party's vice chairman, Henry 
Auerbach, will serve as party head until July, when the newly elected Central 
Committee will select a new chairman to serve a two-year term.

As members of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, Burt and Sheila Galper 
have been counseling other parents for several years. There was a time when 
Burt Galper refused to attend the meetings. The Galpers, parents of four grown 
children, live in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 My 28-year-old son's name is Mitchell. When he was 19 years old, he came home 
from UC Santa Barbara for Christmas vacation. He called my wife into the room 
for some reason or other, and about a half hour later they called me in. My son 
threw a book on the bed, and the title of it was, "Loving Someone Gay." 
</P>
<P>
I looked at it and I asked him, "Why are you showing me this book?" And he 
said, "Because I'm gay." And I fell apart. I just couldn't believe it. We never 
had any idea that he was gay. My first thought was that I was very ashamed of 
him. I was uneducated about gays and I thought that he had made a bad choice. 
</P>
<P>
We started talking about it, and I was crying, and he kept on saying, "Dad, I 
was born this way and there's nothing that I can do to change. You're going to 
have to learn about gays." And I said, "I don't want to learn about gays. As 
long as you're in my house I don't want you to be gay." And we argued. It took 
approximately nine months of torture between the two of us arguing, and Sheila 
and I arguing. 
</P>
<P>
I cried a lot. I was depressed a lot. When Mitch was home during the summer, 
I'd come home and go to my room, I'd watch television, I wouldn't talk to him. 
I wanted him to date girls. He said, "Dad, it doesn't interest me." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila heard about an organization called Parents and Friends of Lesbians and 
Gays. And they said it's very important to bring your husband to a meeting. I 
was stubborn, and I wouldn't go. My wife said, "Mitch isn't going to change. 
Why don't we go to this meeting for him and see?" Finally, I said, "OK, I'll go 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
Each month that I went to a meeting I felt better. I realized that I can't have 
my son live the life that I want him to live. He has to live the life that he 
has to live. I called him up, he was in college, and I said, "I want to tell 
you something. I'm going to accept you completely. I love you, son, 
unconditionally. Everything you do is OK, because conditional love is no love 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
We found out about AIDS in 1981. I brought it up to my son and and he said that 
he was taking care of himself. So I've never really had the fear of him 
catching AIDS. I tell other parents, "Your gay son is probably educated about 
this but your heterosexual daughter is not, and you should educate her." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is a dentist now in the Hollywood area and he does very good work. He 
works one day a week with AIDS Project Los Angeles in a clinic for AIDS 
patients who cannot afford to go to a regular dentist. 
</P>
<P>
He has a lot of friends who are dying. He's very much involved in the AIDS 
Project buddy system. The buddy system is where they become a buddy of an AIDS 
patient. If the AIDS patient is having a problem, he's there to help him. It's 
a great organization and they do good things for AIDS patients. He's lost a 
couple of buddies, and that hurts. 
</P>
<P>
I am a lot smarter than I was years ago and more compassionate. I feel better 
about myself. Maybe I was outside looking in before and now I get involved. If 
it wasn't for my son, we would never have met the people in this organization, 
whom we really love. 
</P>
<P>
We now help other people and we support him 100%. We walk in the parade during 
Gay Pride Week and I carry a big sign that says, "My son is gay and that's OK." 
When we turn the corner on Santa Monica Boulevard, the crowd just stands up and 
start screaming, "We love you, parents. We love you. You're wonderful." It 
brings tears to your eyes; the roar is just unreal. There's so much love from 
them for the parents. A lot of it is because they don't get it from their own 
parents.

CAWTHORNE PETITIONS COURT TO BAR URBAN LEAGUE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former San Diego Urban League President Herb Cawthorne Wednesday asked a 
Superior Court judge to halt the black service agency's lawsuit against him, 
contending that the Urban League breached his contract by not first submitting 
their bitter financial dispute to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne, in documents filed Wednesday, asked the judge to impose unspecified 
monetary penalties on the Urban League, claiming that the filing of the lawsuit 
April 6 "appears to have been motivated solely by a desire to poison the 
community against me, pre-try the case and injure my reputation." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing in the case is scheduled for July 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Urban League is seeking more than $25,000 in damages from Cawthorne for 
allegedly diverting more than $13,000 of its money to personal use, including 
the purchase of airline tickets, hotel rooms, meals, auto expenses, dental work 
and a $1,395 painting. The Urban League also accused Cawthorne of giving away 
at least one of two 1988 Super Bowl tickets purchased for a fund-raiser with 
$2,400 of the organization's funds. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne -- who has conceded "poor judgments" and admitted giving both Super 
Bowl tickets to a friend when efforts to use them for a fund-raising event fell 
through -- suddenly resigned as head of the prominent black social service 
organization June 7 amid circumstances that remained mysterious until the 
lawsuit was filed last month. 
</P>
<P>
Urban League attorney Beatrice Kemp, who drew up Cawthorne's employment 
contract, said Wednesday that the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute 
only if one party requests it in writing. Neither Cawthorne nor the Urban 
League ever made such a request, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Contract terms cited in Cawthorne's filing Wednesday say that any dispute 
between him and the Urban League "shall on the written request of either party 
served on the other be submitted to arbitration." 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne also contended in the filing that he resigned "under pressure, 
without time to consult with my legal counsel and without due process of the 
law." In a news conference April 11, Cawthorne said the Urban League actually 
owes him two months pay because it failed to wait the 60 days required by his 
contract before accepting his resignation.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego city schools trustees voted 3 to 2 to accept the decision of a 
special committee of parents, students, teachers and residents at Patrick Henry 
High School to keep the campus open, meaning students will continue to have 
permission to leave campus during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was the first established under a new Board of Education policy 
that allows the communities around the 16 high schools in the San Diego Unified 
School District to consider changing an open-campus policy. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier internal school committee at Patrick Henry had voted last year to 
keep the campus open, leading to protests from parents and residents that the 
panel was biased. 
</P>
<P>
The school board, with Trustees Jim Roache and Shirley Weber opposed, accepted 
the latest report. Roache and Weber argued that the committee vote is 
inconsistent with informal surveys of parents, the community and school staff, 
which showed overwhelming support for a closed campus. 
</P>
<P>
A committee at Serra High School in Tierrasanta is also considering a change in 
school policy. Many parents and residents believe a closed campus would cut 
down on lunchtime truancy and tardiness, drug and alcohol use, and traffic and 
litter in adjoining neighborhoods.

WILCOX GAINS SUPPORT IN ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican State Assembly candidate Rob Wilcox gained several endorsements 
Wednesday, including those of Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and 
the Los Angeles Police Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by Wilcox, who is an aide to retiring Assemblywoman 
Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), Bernardi described Wilcox as "a 
knowledgeable, experienced, energetic leader." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Grimes, vice president of the union that represents Los Angeles police 
officers, said the group made its endorsement after meeting with Wilcox and his 
chief opponent in the June 5 Republican primary, Granada Hills businesswoman 
Paula Boland. 
</P>
<P>
The police union decided to endorse Wilcox because of his support of additional 
prison construction, Grimes said. He said the union preferred this over 
Boland's position, which blamed the Legislature for not passing laws to toughen 
criminal sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox also received the endorsement of the California Young Republicans, the 
California Republican League and the California League of Conservation Voters, 
the candidate announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Rodriguez, a campaign strategist for Boland, said she has been endorsed 
by Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and Los Angeles County supervisors 
Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich.

CITIES TURN TO PORT FOR REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayors of the five cities in the San Diego Unified Port District -- San 
Diego, Imperial Beach, Chula Vista, Coronado and National City -- appeared 
before the port commissioners Tuesday, asking for money in the form of greater 
reimbursement for public services now provided on port property. 
</P>
<P>
By a 6-0 vote (Commissioner Dan Larsen was absent), the board agreed to draft a 
proposal, to be presented to the state attorney general's office, that would 
allow the Port District to pursue the possibility of paying the cities more for 
such services as police and fire protection and street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The cities have long provided such services on or near Port District tidelands, 
but, in the words of San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, they now need to turn to 
"any and all" revenue sources because they are strapped for money. 
</P>
<P>
Port District Director Don Nay recently said the port's annual revenue now 
exceeds expenditures by more than $40 million, and the port supports "in 
principle" the idea of paying the cities greater fees for public services. 
</P>
<P>
However, he and some of the commissioners have cited outstanding litigation 
against the port as a drawback, as well as demands by the America's Cup 
Organizing Committee to help fund that event, and state guidelines and laws 
that govern the distribution of port revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to be an answer to our problems," O'Connor said, in 
reference to San Diego's $60-million budget deficit, "but certainly it will 
help." MICHAEL GRANBERRY

EL CAPITAN GETS NEARER TO GROSSMONT TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been a long time since El Capitan has won a Grossmont League baseball 
title. So long that El Capitan Coach Steve Vickery would rather not bring it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
But if his Vaqueros keep winning, he just might have to mention it. After a 
come-from-behind, 7-5 victory over host Granite Hills Wednesday, eighth-ranked 
El Capitan (16-7, 4-0) needs to win just two of its final four 3-A league games 
to clinch its first Grossmont title since 1975. Granite Hills (15-8-1, 2-2) and 
Helix (13-8-1, 2-2) are two games back. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to take care of business right now," Vickery said. "We want 
to put the pressure on somebody else. We'll talk about what we've accomplished 
June 10th at our banquet." 
</P>
<P>
If El Capitan does wind up as champion, a good topic of conversation might be 
the six-run sixth inning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With El Capitan trailing, 3-1, catcher Jeep Tharp tied it with his first home 
run of the season, a hit that cleared the center field fence some 370 feet from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Two walks and an error by first baseman Rob Sharkey loaded the bases for 
ninth-place hitter Ryan Ransom, who grounded a single to right to score two 
runs. Sid Melero's RBI single and Mike Farrell's sacrifice fly scored the other 
two runs. 
</P>
<P>
El Capitan starter David Rios (7-1) allowed a two-run double to Granite Hills 
designated hitter Tom Koontz in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Rios, who was victimized by five errors, struck out four and gave up eight hits 
before he was replaced after six innings by Jason Reed. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of kicked the ball around early, but we kept ourselves in a position 
to win the game," Vickery said. DAVE McKIBBEN

WEDBUSH SELLS MORE S&amp;L STOCK; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: COMPANY CONTINUES TO REDUCE ITS HOLDINGS IN TROUBLED GREAT AMERICAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wedbush Corp., which recently disclosed that it had reduced its holdings in 
Great American Bank, has sold off still more of its stock in the troubled 
savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
According to a filing with the federal government, Wedbush sold 263,600 Great 
American shares between April 16 and April 20 for $914,000, an average net sale 
price of $3.47 per share. Moreover, sources close to the S&amp;L say Wedbush 
has sold an additional but unspecified number of Great American shares since 
April 20. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with a previous sale of 416,000 Great American shares disclosed this 
week, the sale left Wedbush with control of 3,394,323 Great American shares, or 
14.2% of the total outstanding. That is down nearly 680,000 shares from the 
4,074,023-share, 17% holding it owned a year ago at this time. Wedbush is still 
Great American's single largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush Chairman Ed Wedbush, who is also a member of Great American's board of 
directors, was unavailable to comment on the reasons for the stock sales. Great 
American stock closed unchanged at $3 a share in light New York Stock Exchange 
trading Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Insider stock sales, or those by corporate officers and directors such as 
Wedbush, are generally a negative sign for a stock. Word of the sale comes at a 
time when capital-deficient Great American is trying to avoid government 
seizure by raising outside capital or by selling itself in part or whole to 
outside financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation that Wedbush's stock sale could be prompted by a "margin 
call," an event prompted when a brokerage or lender demands payment from an 
investor for shares acquired with borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
Margin calls are sometimes triggered by a steep decline in a stock's price and 
Great American's stock, which closed Wednesday at $3, has traded as high as 
$14.875 over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush's filing details the heavy losses that it has taken on its Great 
American investment. According to the documents, Wedbush paid $41.2 million or 
an average $12.22 per share for the Great American shares it still holds. That 
investment is now worth $10.1 million, meaning Wedbush's paper loss on its 
remaining Great American stock is $31.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators have given Great American until Dec. 31 to raise additional capital, 
drastically shrink assets or find a buyer. A handful of outside investors and 
banks, including Security Pacific Bank, Bank of America and the Robert M. Bass 
Group, owners of American Savings, are known to be interested in Great 
American, which has 211 branches and $15.9 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
However, the threat of a government seizure remains real, particularly if Great 
American reports a large enough first-quarter loss to further weaken its 
tenuous capital base. As of Dec. 31, Great American's tangible capital was down 
to $85.9 million, roughly one-third the amount that regulators like to see in 
an S&amp;L its size.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: OLD RADIOS ARE BECOMING POPULAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I collect old radios and would like to get in touch with other 
collectors in this area. -- T.D. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: About a year ago, we answered a collectible question that showcased the 
Southern California Antique Radio Society and its interesting journal. 
Recently, we received a letter from one of the group's directors, Floyd Paul, 
who wrote that the club's membership has climbed to approximately 800 members, 
mostly in this area, but that it also includes about 100 members nationally 
plus a handful abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Paul says there is great interest in collecting antique radios. He writes: 
</P>
<P>
"The club continues to meet quarterly in the Southern California area. New 
members seem to relate to the '40s and '50s. Collectibles include tape and wire 
recorders, TVs, solid-state radios, tube radios, horn speakers, battery radios 
and test equipment, among other items. 
</P>
<P>
"The club invites new members who share an interest in preserving old radios 
and associated equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The club's quarterly journal -- the California Antique Radio Gazette -- has 
been published for the past decade, said Paul, who is the editor. He says that 
the nonprofit organization currently is searching for a museum site to display 
some of its more notable collectible items. 
</P>
<P>
"Most collectors," he says, "enjoy wood/plastic radios of the '30s, '40s and 
'50s, which may be worth $10 to $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of old radios yet to come out of attics and garages, and the 
Gazette helps identify these and give history about them." 
</P>
<P>
Individuals interested in joining the society should write the membership 
secretary, Mary Ireland, 24100-E Avenida Rancheros, Diamond Bar, Calif. 91765. 
</P>
<P>
The group's next meeting, on May 19, will feature its annual auction, including 
radio sets, equipment, magazines and books. It's a luncheon scheduled for the 
Velvet Turtle restaurant, 3210 W. Sepulveda Blvd., Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
In the May issue of the Gazette is a piece on the history of the Zenith 
Trans-Oceanic radio, which generated a recent question from a collector who 
thought he had one of the earliest models. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Glenview, Ill.-based firm, John Taylor, said collectors can 
tell the approximate year of manufacture by checking the radio's model numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the workhorse," he said, noting that of the "tens of thousands" that 
were manufactured over a four-decade period, a large number are still providing 
good service. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an original sitting in my office and it still works," he said in a 
recent telephone interview. "It's one of the most long-lived products in the 
consumer electronics industry." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, its last year of manufacture, the Trans-Oceanic -- by then produced in 
Taiwan -- was battling foreign competitors, who were dramatically underpricing 
it. At the time, Taylor recalled, the model's retail price was about $450. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Gazette article, provided by Zenith, the idea for the 
Trans-Oceanic was hatched by the company's late founder-president, Commander E. 
F. McDonald Jr., who, in 1939, found that standard broadcast reception at his 
Canadian fishing lodge was poor. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald "asked the company's engineering staff to develop an experimental 
shortwave battery-operated portable radio," the article states. "With this set 
aboard his electric trolling boat, the commander was able to receive weather 
predictions by shortwave from Lorain, Ohio, and, out of curiosity, even 
programs from London." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Trans-Oceanic was born. Succeeding sets had broader bands for easier 
tuning. After more than two years of research, which included a test in the 
remote Arctic, the set went into mass production before the Zenith factory had 
to convert to war production.

YOUR STAMPS: PULASKI COMMEMORATIVES WERE ISSUED IN 1931 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE, Krause, a free-lance writer and a member of several national 
stamp-collecting organizations 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have a full sheet of the 2-cent Gen. Pulaski U.S. stamp of, I 
believe, the 1930s. What is this sheet worth? -- E.C. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Maybe $10 or more. You probably have a pane instead of a sheet of 
stamps. This 2-cent commemorative honoring the Polish patriotic hero of the 
American Revolution was issued in panes of 100 stamps, after being printed from 
a printing plate of 400 stamps -- four panes, which were then cut apart. (What 
most people call sheets are really panes -- the typical format of stamps 
purchased at the post office.) The first day of issue date was Jan. 16, 1931, 
and the Post Office Department issued more than 90 million of these stamps, so 
they are not especially scarce today. The margin plate block of 6 with plate 
number attached, worth $5 to $10 retail, is the real value item in this pane. 
If you have a perfectly centered undamaged plate block, it is worth more than 
all the rest of the 94 stamps in the pane. Singles of the Pulaski issue retail 
for a dime each. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I need an honest appraiser and dealer to buy my collection of Israeli 
stamps, which had a retail value of $3,500 in 1970-71. Ready to sell. Daughter 
to college. Please advise. -- J.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: Depending, of course, on which Israeli issues you have, it is quite possible 
that your collection, which retailed for $3,500 about 20 years ago, has 
appreciated in value since then. Select two dealers from the Yellow Pages and 
visit them with your stamps, saying that you want to sell outright, and ask for 
a wholesale appraisal. If their offers are similar, they are probably giving 
you a fair price. Call first to be certain they are interested in your 
material. 
</P>

Stamp News 
</P>
<P>
A new biography, "Rowland Hill, Genius and Benefactor, 1795-1879" by Colin G. 
Hey, has just been published. Hill is generally credited with having invented 
the postage stamp, Great Britain's Penny Black, in 1840. 
</P>
<P>
He also persuaded British postal authorities to lower postal rates drastically, 
demonstrating by arguments and statistics that the savings allowed by low 
prepaid postage stamps would reduce postal workers' time and labor so much that 
the resulting postal revenues would actually increase. 
</P>
<P>
And that is what happened. The printing presses couldn't keep up with the 
demand for the new postage stamps. On the first day, large crowds poured into 
the streets of London to celebrate the introduction of cheap uniform postage 
rates, and the police had to be called in to keep traffic routes open. Queen 
Victoria honored the event by renouncing her free-franking privilege, which 
allowed her to send mail for free (as U.S. congressmen still do, with their 
printed signature in lieu of postage on the envelope). 
</P>
<P>
Although it doesn't deal only with postal matters, this new biography of 
Rowland Hill, whose name is synonymous with early British philately, treats 
many interesting aspects and accomplishments of his life. Available for $19.95 
at B. Dalton and Waldenbooks stores, or directly from the publisher: Scott 
Publishing Co., 911 Vandemark Road, Sidney, Ohio 45365.

YOUR COINS: TREASURE IN DRAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Although I am not an avid coin collector, an item in one of your 
articles last year regarding an 1852 Canadian penny caught my eye. Also the 
statement you made a long time ago: "They are out there somewhere." They sure 
are. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I dropped in on a garage sale. She liked some old drapes and we 
bought them, but they were too long, so she cut off the bottom. I was curious 
to find out what was in each corner to make them hang straight. This is what I 
found: 
</P>
<P>
Two penny tokens from the Bank of Upper Canada dated 1852, two others dated 
1857 and 1837, a George III Hibernia 1805 and one dated 1777 (I believe), a 
token dated 1878, and a penny bank token dated 1831 with the obverse in French 
and inscribed Evins and Bolton Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
So you are correct: They are out there. -- E.C.W. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I hope your find doesn't inspire others to slash their drapes in hopes 
of discovering some treasures. But it is an example of what I meant when I 
wrote that article. Generally, most coins are either in the hands of 
collectors, dealers or museums. But occasionally, interesting pieces will turn 
up in the most unlikely places. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists still unearth buried vessels from ancient days filled with coins; 
treasure hunters still find trunks of silver and gold at the bottom of the 
ocean, and, as you discovered, coins may even be found sewn into drapes. I 
don't recommend garage sales as the best place to purchase coins; you'll still 
do better getting them directly from the Mint, a dealer or at a coin show or 
auction. But as I've said before, one of the joys of collecting is the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the drapes cost, but your coins and tokens are each probably 
in the $5 to $25 range. I'd have them checked out, especially the George III 
Hibernia and the one with the inscription.

DANCE: LEONID YAKOBSON'S 'RODIN' TURNS OUT TO BE A SET OF AMOROUS DUETS IN 
WHICH STATUES COME TO LIFE AND STRIKE BANAL POSES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviets considered Leonid Yakobson (a.k.a. Jakobson or, if you will, 
Jacobson) a maverick. As a choreographer -- and presumably in other ways as 
well -- he chose not to follow party lines. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1904, he might have become a genuine innovator like his illustrious 
Leningrad colleague, George Balanchine. Yakobson fell victim, however, to a 
system that invariably championed bland eclecticism in the service of so-called 
Soviet realism. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death in 1975, his relatively unconventional choreography 
for the original version of "Spartacus" had been superseded by the popular 
revisionism of Yuri Grigorovich. No one cared to remember Yakobson's 
contribution to the world premiere of "The Golden Age." 
</P>
<P>
In his final years, he concentrated on the creation of miniatures for the 
not-too-prestigious Leningrad State Ballet. He remained tragically isolated 
from the stimulation of Western modernism. 
</P>
<P>
If American audiences know his work at all, it must be through Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, who used to favor a bravura character study called "Vestris." 
Yakobson had created it for him back in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Helgi Tomasson, director of the San Francisco Ballet, made a 
valiant -- and frustrating -- effort to enhance Yakobson's international 
reputation. He asked Irina Yakobson, the choreographer's widow and now a much 
valued coach and teacher, to stage the U.S. premiere of Yakobson's "Rodin" for 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
This set of laboriously amorous, quasi-sculptural duets accompanied by 
sugar-coated Debussy may have seemed daring in 1958 at the conservative Kirov. 
Natalia Makarova, who participated in the first performance, wrote glowingly of 
the experience in her autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
The suite must have seemed downright shocking in 1970, when Yakobson added two 
strident sections utilizing music by Alban Berg. To the innocent Soviet 
sensibilities of the period, both sight and sound suggested dangerous yet 
eminently delicious decadence. 
</P>
<P>
In the cool American light of 1990, alas, "Rodin" looks dated, even silly. 
Michael Smuin's "Eternal Idol," a similar exercise in erotic kitsch, has come 
and, mercifully, gone. Comparable ventures by such pop icons as Maurice Bejart 
and Gerald Arpino have blunted the common perspective. 
</P>
<P>
One can appreciate the canny precision with which Yakobson asked his dancers to 
plaster and drape their bodies against each other. One can applaud the stylized 
passion, not to mention the ingenuity of the athletic tangles and the artsy 
poses. Still, one has to regret the poverty of the dance vocabulary employed 
here, and cringe at the basic banality of invention. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodin" recalls nothing so much as Margo Sappington's once-notorious nude 
ballet in "Oh! Calcutta!" Unlike their Broadway counterparts, however, 
Yakobson's lovers are burdened with flesh-colored body stockings. 
</P>
<P>
They are burdened further by Yakobson's naive perversion of his musical 
sources. The Hallmark Card renditions of Debussy's greatest hits are hard to 
endure. But disaster beckons with the misappropriation of Berg's "Praludium" 
(from the Three Orchestral Pieces) and third "Wozzeck" interlude. Harmonic 
dissonance, Yakobson apparently reasoned, must translate as all-purpose 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
The five San Francisco couples -- Elizabeth Loscavio and Edward Ellison, Katita 
Waldo and Jais Zinoun, Evelyn Cisneros and Anthony Randazzo, Galina Alexandrova 
and Mikko Nissinen, Wendy Van Dyck and Jim Sohm -- flung themselves into the 
challenge on Tuesday as if lives, not to mention artistic principles, were at 
stake. Jean-Louis LeRoux did what could be done in the well-staffed pit. 
</P>
<P>
The triple bill opened with an old San Francisco specialty: Lew Christensen's 
attractive if gimmicky send-up of neo-classical maneuvers, "Il Distratto." The 
evening closed with a new San Francisco speciality: Tomasson's gracefully 
sprawling ode to Balanchine and the Baroque, "Handel -- A Celebration." 
</P>
<P>
The dancing was splendid.

Photo, ART OF DINING -- It was called the Art of Dining III. Nine chefs from 
around the world gathered at the Four Season's Hotel in Newport Beach to cook 
an eight course dinner for 450 patrons of the art. The event, which raised 
$250,000 to benefit the Newport Harbor Museum also included an auction of a 
1990 Jaguar convertible, a pair of Tiffany watches and a dinner for 12 by 
Joachim Splichal of Patina Restaurant in Los Angeles. The guests sat down to a 
synchronized meal which included eggplant caviar and caponata, timbale of 
salmon, smoked rabbit consomme, scallop roe in a potato crust, pasta with wild 
mushroom and truffle juice, roast foie gras in a corn crepe with Banyuls sauce, 
roast lamb chop wrapped in vegetable mousseline and three exquisite desserts. 
The chefs who worked together, contributing their talents to the dinner are, 
from left, Michel Pieton of the Four Seasons Newport Beach; Joachim Splichal; 
Debra Ponzek of New York's Montrachet, Christopher Gross of Christopher's in 
Arizona; Michel Galloyer of Le Trianon in Angers, France; Susan Spicer of 
Bayona in New Orleans; Pierre Herme of Fauchon in Paris; Hubert Keller of Fleur

COOK IT LIGHT: NO-KNEAD BREAD NEEDS LESS HEAT

DEAR JEANNE: We have baked this bread many times. The taste is good, but when 
we cut it, the slice crumbles. What are we doing wrong? It is easy to make -- 
no kneading. 
</P>
<P>
LILLIAN, Chicago 
</P>
<P>
NO-KNEAD BREAD 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup shortening 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
3 (1-ounce) cakes yeast 
</P>
<P>
3 eggs, beaten 
</P>
<P>
9 cups sifted flour 
</P>
<P>
Scald milk. Add shortening, sugar and salt and stir until sugar and salt are 
dissolved. Cool mixture to lukewarm by adding water. 
</P>
<P>
Add yeast and mix, then add eggs. Gradually add flour and mix until dough is 
well blended. Place in large greased bowl and cover (dough will be softer than 
kneaded dough). Let rise in warm place until about doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Punch down dough and shape into 3 loaves on lightly floured board. Place loaves 
in greased loaf pans, cover and let rise again for about 1 hour or until 
doubled. Bake loaves in at 400 degrees 45 to 50 minutes. Makes 3 loaves. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR LILLIAN: After making the recipe your way, I had a similar problem with 
the bread crumbling. I also found it cumbersome trying to deal with such large 
quantities of ingredients, so when I worked on the revision I made it one loaf 
at a time, which is much easier. 
</P>
<P>
I used nonfat milk to lower the fat and cholesterol, whole-wheat flour for 
added flavor and nutrients, and reduced the fat, sugar and salt. To eliminate 
the cholesterol in the egg yolks, I used only the whites of the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
After making these changes, I tried making the bread again, and still wasn't 
satisfied with the resulting texture. Then I decided to try letting it rise 
only once, which was better but not perfect. Finally I combined one rising with 
a lower oven temperature and the result was wonderful both in taste and 
texture. This bread is also fabulous toasted for breakfast.

GLENDALE ASKS CITIZENS TO BLOW WHISTLE ON WATER-WASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several days before the Glendale City Council enacted mandatory water 
conservation rules aimed at cutting consumption by 10%, Councilwoman Ginger 
Bremberg began getting calls about water-wasters. 
</P>
<P>
"One was about a business that was using a high-pressure hose to clean off the 
sidewalk," she said. "One of them was about a sprinkler system that had gone 
berserk" and was spraying water into the street. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, such practices were outlawed under the first phase of a 
conservation plan that was activated unanimously by the council. Pre-meeting 
publicity prompted the calls to Bremberg, and city officials said they'll need 
such tips to meet Glendale's water cutback goals. 
</P>
<P>
"You ought to be a rat-fink on your neighbors who use too much water," 
Councilman Carl Raggio said at Tuesday's meeting. "I intend to practice that to 
the hilt." 
</P>
<P>
The council implemented the first stage in a five-step water conservation 
ordinance adopted in February. The last four stages would require each customer 
to reduce water usage by a specific percentage. City officials do not believe 
the more serious cutbacks are needed now, but they said the early conservation 
measures must be imposed to avert water rationing next year, if the drought 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, Glendale uses about 28 million gallons of water a day, although 
a summer heat wave can boost the daily draw to about 50 million gallons, city 
staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
The state's four-year drought has led a number of cities to implement 
conservation measures. But unlike neighboring Los Angeles, Glendale is not 
planning to hire "drought busters" to cruise the city in search of 
water-wasters. 
</P>
<P>
"There's generally pretty good peer pressure that tends to make enforcement 
self-supporting" said Michael P. Hopkins, the Glendale's director of public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules: 
</P>
<P>
* Hose-washing of walkways, driveways, sidewalks and parking lots is 
prohibited, except by public safety officers flushing away a hazardous 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
* Decorative fountains must recirculate their water. 
</P>
<P>
* Restaurants must serve drinking water only on request. 
</P>
<P>
* Water leaks must be repaired in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
* Lawns and other landscaping cannot be watered between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., 
when more water is lost to evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the rules may have a minimal impact. 
</P>
<P>
For example, virtually all fountains in Glendale already recirculate their 
water, including those outside City Hall and in the city's Maryland Avenue 
renewal project. The privately operated waterfall at the 330 N. Brand Blvd. 
high-rise also recycles its water, the building's chief engineer said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Southern California's water shortage, decorative fountains, ponds and 
waterfalls have become a popular feature in office building plazas in the 
city's central redevelopment area. Jeanne Armstrong, Glendale's redevelopment 
director, said the city requires that such systems recycle their water. 
</P>
<P>
But even recirculating fountains require regular refilling because of water 
lost to evaporation and wind. Armstrong said past droughts have prompted some 
Northern California cities to halt the use of tap water in fountains. However, 
these cities have allowed fountains to continue operating with reclaimed water 
from treatment plants, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Reclaimed water from Glendale's treatment plant will soon be piped to the 
Forest Lawn cemetery for irrigation, but no connections to public fountains are 
immediately planned, public service director Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city's new mandate on fountains may contribute little to the 
conservation effort, Hopkins believes several of the other steps will. Even the 
seemingly insignificant cutback on drinking water at restaurants will help 
because the equivalent of three additional glasses are water are used in 
washing each glass for reuse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope publicity surrounding the mandatory curbs will encourage 
residents to conserve in other ways. "The prohibited uses are really intended 
to increase public awareness of the problem," Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the mandatory measures may cut water use by 5%. To conserve the 
additional 5%, the city is counting on a public information campaign that will 
urge Glendale residents to exercise self-discipline at their spigots. 
</P>
<P>
Through water-bill inserts and school programs, residents will be reminded of 
simple conservation measures, such as not letting the tap flow while shaving or 
brushing one's teeth. 
</P>
<P>
In targeting a 10% cutback, Glendale is complying with a region-wide 
recommendation by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The 
MWD, which obtains water from Northern California and the Colorado River, 
provides 80% to 90% of the water used in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are successful in reducing the demand by 10% over the summer, that will 
save us 200,000 acre-feet that we can put in storage for next year, should the 
drought continue," said MWD spokesman Bob Gompers. 
</P>
<P>
As an incentive, the MWD is offering a rebate of $100 per acre-foot to 
municipal customers who reduce summer water consumption at least 5%. An 
acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials will take a relatively low-key stance regarding those who 
violate the mandatory conservation rules. 
</P>
<P>
For the first two offenses, a violator will receive a written warning but no 
fine. After the third offense, the city will install a flow constrictor to 
curtail the customer's water. 
</P>
<P>
A cutoff in service can be initiated for the fourth violation, but city 
officials believe it is unlikely that step will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Glendale would always like to lead with the sugar instead of the vinegar on 
these things," said Mark A. Doyle, a member of the Glendale Public Service 
Commission, which recommended the water curbs to the council. 
</P>
<P>
To find the violators, Glendale is relying on public tips and reports from 
hundreds of city employees. Councilwoman Bremberg said she doesn't mind hearing 
from residents who say their neighbors are wasting water. 
</P>
<P>
"It means they're paying attention," she said. "And that's all it takes."

CHAMBER PRESENTS ITS DOWNZONING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: ADVOCATES OF THE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY SAY IT WILL DAMAGE PROPERTY 
VALUES LESS THAN THE CITY'S GROWTH-CONTROL PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Chamber of Commerce said Tuesday that a six-month land survey by 
more than 100 volunteers shows that the city can scale down development in a 
way that will do less damage to property values than a city proposal would do. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber officials said the study supports an alternative plan they presented 
several months ago, which they said would give property owners an option to 
increase the value of their land by making it part of a larger project built on 
adjoining lots. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber's study shows its plan still would accomplish the Glendale City 
Council's goal of limiting construction to about 10,000 more apartments or 
condominiums, chamber officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To curb Glendale's population boom, the City Council is considering proposals 
to change the zoning in areas earmarked for multiple-family buildings, so that 
fewer new units can be built. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing a summary of the study Tuesday, council members praised the 
chamber's work but said they would not abandon their own strategy of reducing 
growth by downzoning -- changing zoning regulations to permit fewer multifamily 
residential units to be built. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the council considered a blanket downzoning plan to reduce housing 
density citywide. In March, the council decided to tailor growth limits to 
local conditions in 25 selected neighborhoods. That review will resume June 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we still have to go neighborhood by neighborhood and see what the 
result is," Mayor Larry Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's downzoning plans have triggered an outcry from many property 
owners, who say that allowing fewer units on their lots will dramatically 
reduce the value of their land. 
</P>
<P>
The primary difference between the chamber plan and the city's is that the 
former would allow an increase in the number of apartments or condominiums on a 
site if a builder added adjoining lots. That would increase the value of each 
lot, chamber officials say. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the city's plan might allow no more than two four-unit apartment 
buildings on adjacent lots. But under the chamber's plan, a developer who 
purchased both could build a single 12-unit complex. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, 'How is the council going to minimize the damage to the 
property owners and at the same time manage growth in the city?' " said Hamo 
Rostamian, a developer who heads the chamber's housing and urban development 
committee. "We believe we have provided a viable solution to that." 
</P>
<P>
He said volunteers from the real estate industry and other businesses spent the 
past six months conducting a lot-by-lot visual inspection of Glendale's 
neighborhoods zoned for multifamily housing. The volunteers counted 4,572 lots 
where single-family houses, duplexes and triplexes could be replaced by larger 
apartment or condominium complexes. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers also identified places where lots could be combined for the 
higher-density projects allowed under the chamber plan. The study concluded 
that the maximum number of new apartments or condominiums that could be built 
in Glendale under the chamber's plan would be 10,208. 
</P>
<P>
Those could house about 27,000 new residents under the chamber's calculations, 
and up to 35,000 by the city's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jerold Milner said he was pleased that the chamber agrees with the 
council's goal of capping growth at about 10,000 more units. But he said he 
objects to rewarding developers who can assemble a large project on adjoining 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
"Their proposal up front discriminates against single-lot owners," Milner said. 
"It gives a significant economic advantage to a professional developer. I think 
that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
He said the chamber's plan provides no relief to a person who owns a single lot 
between two large apartment complexes, with no chance of using the land for a 
combined-lot project. Milner said the council's neighborhood-by-neighborhood 
review will look for ways to help such property owners. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber's Rostamian said larger housing projects should be encouraged 
because they are usually better managed and have more flexibility in design. He 
said building one large project is less disruptive to a neighborhood than a 
series of smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Raggio said he was pleased to see that the chamber's study 
corroborated some of the growth predictions prepared independently by the 
city's staff. 
</P>
<P>
Now that there is wide agreement that the city should allow only about 10,000 
new apartments and condominiums, the council must agree on a downzoning formula 
to reach that goal, Raggio said. 
</P>
<P>
He said some elements of the chamber's proposal could be incorporated into the 
final plan adopted by the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council has imposed a moratorium on new apartment and condominium 
construction while the downzoning plan is being prepared. City Manager David H. 
Ramsay predicted Tuesday that the council's review will last at least three 
more months.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The father of a Glendale man accused of killing two people in a traffic 
collision and fleeing the scene pleaded guilty last week to giving police false 
information about his son's alleged involvement in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Rodolfo Ayala, 54, was sentenced by a Pasadena Superior Court judge to 180 
days in jail for being an accessory after the fact to the Jan. 3 accident.

TERMINI NAMED OUTSTANDING PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD S. PALMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mt. Washington resident who teaches music history and musicology at Cal State 
Los Angeles has been named this year's outstanding professor by the California 
State University Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Termini, 59, will receive the award during a reception at the trustees 
meeting May 16. She also will receive $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The honor is given annually to two individuals selected from more than 20,000 
faculty in the 20-campus system. Receiving the second award this year will be 
Donald T. Hata Jr., professor of history at the Dominguez Hills campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not ready for this at all," said Termini, who was advising a student in 
her office March 14 when she was notified of the award. "In my cynical mind, I 
thought they wanted me to serve on another committee. I was almost literally 
speechless." 
</P>
<P>
During her career at Cal State Los Angeles, Termini has published a number of 
studies of baroque music and Venetian opera, which are areas of special 
interest to her. She publishes about one research paper a year, said Ruth 
Goldway, director of public affairs for the university. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hamburg, Germany, Termini emigrated to the United States in 1952. She 
earned three degrees from the USC School of Music. Before coming to the 
university to teach in 1972, Termini taught junior and senior high school 
students for 18 years in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The personal interaction with students remains the most satisfying part of the 
job, "especially when I can strike a little enthusiasm in the students," 
Termini said. She especially enjoys working with individual students on 
independent study projects. 
</P>
<P>
Termini said she is planning to use the award money to travel to Korea for the 
Pacific Contemporary Music Center's annual music festival. In addition to her 
teaching duties, Termini is the assistant director for the center, which 
promotes the music of new composers.

PROSPECTIVE CITY MANAGER HOPES RACIAL ISSUE WILL STAY IN OHIO;

PASADENA: A TOLEDO MAN IS OFFERED THE JOB AFTER THE DIRECTORS CONCLUDE THAT 
ACCUSATIONS OF RACIAL INSENSITIVITY ARE UNFOUNDED.

TOLEDO, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Toledo Alive" was the slogan here in 1986 when Philip Hawkey became city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
As newcomers to this Midwestern city of 343,000, then in the midst of economic 
revival, Hawkey and his wife, Dena, strolled through Portside, a bustling new 
shopping center on the banks of the Maumee River. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasure boats filled the river, tied up one to the other in a string of 
vessels that stretched nearly to the other side. Radisson and Marriott hotels 
were springing up, and the new SeaGate Convention Center was expected to 
attract convention-goers to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I came here was to be on the forefront of a changing community," 
said Hawkey, who recently became enmeshed in controversy after he was selected 
as the new city manager of Pasadena. "All indications were that this was a city 
taking off." 
</P>
<P>
"It really looked wonderful, and we were so excited," Dena Hawkey agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But in the four years since, Toledo's economic fortunes have plummeted, as have 
Hawkey's career hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Portside is now deserted of shoppers after 5 p.m., its canned Muzak blaring 
down the empty mall. Downtown hotels operate half full. The city has lost four 
of its seven Fortune 500 companies and might lose a Jeep manufacturing plant 
and 5,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 43-year-old city manager who expected to oversee an economic 
renaissance in Toledo has instead been buffeted by intense enmity from members 
of Toledo's black community, critical of what they say is his racial 
insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
That criticism, and a racial discrimination complaint filed against the city by 
the Ohio attorney general's office, prompted the Pasadena Board of Directors to 
reconsider its decision to hire Hawkey as a replacement for retiring 17-year 
veteran City Manager Donald McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
The board met Monday and decided to again offer the post to Hawkey. After 
examining documents from the Ohio Civil Rights Commission for three hours in 
closed session, the board concluded that the accusations of racism were 
unfounded, Mayor William Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey said he plans to accept the job effective June 18, pending the outcome 
of contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey bills himself as a "child of the '60s," dedicated to racial harmony and 
openness. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't deserve this," said Dena Hawkey, who bristles at the attacks on her 
husband. "We have nothing to prove. We have demonstrated our kindness and 
compassion." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Hawkeys are an appealing couple who appear dedicated to liberal and 
family values. Married 20 years, they have three children, 15, 12 and 11 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Dena Hawkey, 41, has a degree in social work and has worked for Head Start 
programs and the Red Cross. She serves as development director for a homeless 
center in Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeys live in an integrated neighborhood in Toledo, an upscale area 
called Westmoreland. From their back yard, they can see the residence of Philip 
Hawkey's most strident critic, the Rev. Floyd Rose. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkey children attend a private school with an integrated student body. 
The family's residence is decorated with original artwork and hand-woven Greek 
rugs that reflect Dena Hawkey's Greek Orthodox background. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Hawkey's background may have swayed some Pasadena directors, who 
developed a personal liking for the Toledo city manager, according to a 
high-ranking Pasadena City Hall source. 
</P>
<P>
The source said that City Director Kathryn Nack reared her children in the 
1960s and was persuaded by Hawkey's talk of '60s values such as community 
activism, public service and racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Nack said that she empathizes with Hawkey's experiences in the '60s. "It sets a 
tone for his philosophy for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the City Hall source, Hawkey's links with Toledo Republicans and 
his experience as an attorney appealed to Pasadena Mayor Thomson, a Republican 
and an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said that he didn't know that Hawkey was a Republican, but found the 
Toledo city manager to be a "well-spoken and persuasive person." Such skills 
are needed in Pasadena, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The skills also were evident to many who dealt with Hawkey in Toledo. Yet many 
of Hawkey's critics there perceived his charisma as hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Williams, president of the Toledo NAACP, said that Hawkey signed a Fair 
Share Agreement to meet minority hiring goals within the city, but that those 
goals were never met. 
</P>
<P>
City job statistics, however, show that the number of blacks in top 
administrative positions has more than doubled under Hawkey. The percentage of 
all minorities in top administrative positions is now 22.8%, compared with 
12.7% when Hawkey took the job. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Ortega, a Latina activist, said Hawkey appeared to be supportive of 
Latino concerns but failed to hire Latinos in numbers equal to their 
representation in the work force, a complaint backed up in a 
soon-to-be-released city report. 
</P>
<P>
According to Toledo affirmative action specialist Gloria Ruiz, who helped 
prepare the report, the city has lagged in hiring Latinos. Exact numbers in the 
report could not be obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Hawkey's 1988 firing of Pete Culp, a city employee who oversaw federal 
housing money, and the denial of his severance pay is cited repeatedly by 
critics of the city manager as evidence of his failure in race relations. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey says he fired Culp because federal officials, contending the housing 
money had been grossly mismanaged, had blocked the city's spending of the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Toledo's black community officials counter that in his treatment of Culp, 
Hawkey applied a harsher standard than he used for white employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had more turmoil on race issues in the past few years than we had during 
the late 1960s," Jack Ford, Toledo's only black city councilman, said. Ford 
said that Hawkey "is talented and comes across in a very strong, personal way, 
but the sensitivity to manage race conflicts -- I've not seen him be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey concedes he probably should have acted sooner on the race issue. 
Instead, he said, he failed to build personal relationships with blacks and to 
identify the city's black leaders for himself. He said he relied too much on 
the assessments of elected officials and city staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole racial issue is probably the most painful for me," Hawkey said. "I 
grew up in the '60s. We were committed to making the world better." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, he realizes that improving race relations takes more than living 
in an integrated neighborhood and teaching his children proper values. There 
are long-term problems that need to be exposed, along with accumulated racial 
bitterness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a guy who always thought he was liberal and sensitive and caring," 
Hawkey said. "I guess I've developed a better understanding, a recognition that 
you can't personally solve all those problems."

OCCIDENTAL WINS CONFERENCE TRACK TITLES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Occidental College men's and women's track teams continue to dominate the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend at the SCIAC championships, the Tiger women won their 11th 
consecutive title and the men won their ninth title in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental women won 12 of 16 events while the men claimed nine of 17. 
</P>
<P>
Glenda Mitchell was named the conference's female athlete of the year after 
winning the 100- and the 400-meter hurdles, the 400 meters and anchoring the 
Tigers' victorious 4 x 100 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Brady Dargan of Occidental was named the top male athlete after winning the 
hammer, shotput and discus. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers will compete in the Northridge invitational this week and then stage 
their own invitational May 12 before they travel to the NCAA Division III 
championships May 23-26 at North Central College at Naperville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Clearing barriers: Marty Beck of Glendale College enters Saturday's Southern 
California prelims at Cerritos College undefeated in the 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles this season. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's Western State Conference championships, Beck eclipsed his 
personal best of 52.35 seconds with a meet-record 51.84 clocking. 
</P>
<P>
Beck also anchored Glendale's 1,600-meter relay team, which finished third, 
with a 46.2 leg. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in his first season running the intermediate hurdles, Beck won the 
WSC championship and placed ninth in the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd make it past the Southern California finals last year," 
said Beck, who has orally committed to UCLA. "I never had any idea I'd make it 
to state. My form has improved so much over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be state champion. I think I've put everything else on the back 
burner." 
</P>
<P>
In memoriam: Glendale's James Moore dedicated his 10,000-meter race at the WSC 
championships to teammate Pablo Herrera, who died in an automobile accident 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to do our homework together and we used to stay in the same rooms when 
we traveled," Moore said. "He was probably my closest friend on the team. (The 
10,000) was his race and he should have been here. I wanted to win it for him." 
</P>
<P>
Moore did, sweeping past Juan Romero of Bakersfield in the final 200 meters to 
win in 31:36.0, almost a minute faster than his previous best. Moore also 
placed second in the 5,000-meter run. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Dave Swanson won the WSC title in the high jump (6 feet, 10 inches) 
and Marji Gilles won the triple jump (37-4 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale team wore black bands on its uniforms at the WSC championships in 
memory of Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
Pointed differences: Glendale was dominant in the middle-distance races at the 
WSC championships, picking up 41 of its 143 points in the 800 and 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Provenzano won the 1,500 (3:59.20) as Glendale placed four runners among 
the top seven. Nick Lugo (1:56.73) and Derrick Mitchell (1:56.93) placed first 
and second in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
But Bakersfield outscored Glendale, 114 1/2 to 19, in the field events to win 
its second consecutive WSC title with 223 1/2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Fight on: Pepe Reilly of Glendale will compete in the National Golden Gloves 
championships Saturday at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly, 18, won a unanimous decision over Theodoro Garcia in the 119-pound 
bantamweight decision at the California Golden Gloves finals last weekend at 
Lincoln Park in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of the national championships will earn berths in the Goodwill Games 
box-offs, June 8-9 at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: Joshua Mann and John Padilla of Eagle Rock High, Hank Hou of 
Marshall and Jenny Nicholas of Flintridge Sacred Heart were among the players 
on the 1990 Scholar Squad selected by California Basketball magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight boys and 38 girls were selected for the teams, which honor athletic 
and academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Stretch drive: The Occidental baseball team has a slim chance of winning the 
SCIAC title, but the Tigers must sweep Whittier and hope Caltech trips up 
conference-leading Claremont this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental improved to 10-5 in SCIAC play last weekend with a three-game sweep 
of Caltech in which the Tigers outscored their opponents, 34-3. Occidental and 
La Verne are in second place behind Claremont (11-4). 
</P>
<P>
Tournament time: Occidental College will sponsor a golf tournament May 11 at 
the San Dimas Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, co-sponsored by the Tiger Club and Raider running back Vance 
Mueller, a former Occidental football standout, will raise money for the 
Occidental athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, and a banquet, is open to 144 participants and will be played 
with a scramble format.

A commentary in Nuestro Tiempo (December) rightly pointed out the many 
achievements reached by Latinos during the 1980s. In hindsight, however, the 
'80s also must be remembered as a highly anti-Latino decade. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Latino remarks were catapulted from being muttered under one's breath to 
being flashed across newspaper headlines. Charges that Latinos are un-American, 
refuse to assimilate, and refuse to learn English became TV talk show fare. 
</P>
<P>
The English-only movement became a lucrative fund-raising vehicle for dozens of 
organizations across the country determined to rid the nation of any public use 
of Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the racist motives of the lead organization, U.S. English, were 
unmasked in 1988. But unfortunately, English-only proponents are still at it. A 
Chicago alderman recently suggested that merchants be required to pass an 
English-proficiency test. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 did offer a tremendous 
opportunity for many to become legal residents and ultimately citizens. But 
IRCA was fundamentally an exclusionary policy, this nation's harshest 
immigration law ever. The new law has not accomplished what it was purported to 
do. It has not stopped unlawful immigration nor the employment of undocumented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 immigration law did succeed in dramatically increasing employment 
discrimination against Latinos. The General Accounting Office determined that 
16% of employers surveyed discriminate against Latinos as a direct result of 
the new law. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Latinos as a group were left out of the nation's economic 
progress. During the 1980s, the rate of increase in the number of Latinos 
living in poverty far outpaced the rate of increase in the Latino population 
overall. Latino children fared the worse. Today, two out of every five Latino 
children live in poverty. In households headed by a single mother, 80% of 
Latino children are poor. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s were a decade of significant progress for Latinos, and that must be 
recognized. However, we also must understand that the anti-Latino sentiment 
that flourished was partly a reaction to the increased visibility and influence 
of this growing segment of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos and non-Latinos would do well to learn the lessons of the 1980s. Social 
progress is not achieved without some expense. In the 1990s, we should remind 
ourselves that increased diversity strengthens our society and must be 
respected at minimum, and welcomed and promoted at best.

Gloria Estefan's recent traffic accident brought an outpouring of concern from 
fans and friends. The New York hospital where Miami Sound Machine's vivacious 
32-year-old singer underwent surgery for a broken back was flooded with 
flowers, balloons and phone calls from around the world. Well-wishers included 
fellow performers Elton John, Diana Ross, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Jon 
Bon Jovi, as well as President Bush who, only hours before the accident, had 
met with the Estefans at the White House to discuss their anti-drug work. 
Gloria's husband, 37-year-old Emilio Estefan Jr., thanked doctors and fans for 
their support. "I don't care if she never danced again," he said. "I'm just 
happy she's alive." Later, when Gloria left the hospital in April to continue 
her recuperation in Miami, her doctor said she should be back at full strength 
in six months, and might even be able to dance the conga again. 
</P>
<P>
Good news about Anthony Quinn, so well recovered from his recent bypass surgery 
that he has returned to work on "A Star for Two," in which the veteran actor, 
75, plays a doctor. The film also stars Lauren Bacall. 
</P>
<P>
Placido Domingo and Julio Iglesias have melodiously joined voices on Manuel 
Alejandro's haunting composition "Sonadores de Espana" ("Dreamers of Spain"). 
Domingo, who insists he is not turning his back on opera, nonetheless admits he 
would like Mexican composer Armando Manzanero to open him to some "pop" songs. 
And when he recently guested on Joan Rivers' TV show, the tenor confessed he 
keeps his voice in top condition by not talking much the day before a 
performance. 
</P>

Hollywood's latest "discovery," Trini Alvarado, the young actress who garnered 
superb reviews as Bette Midler's daughter in the movie "Stella," is the 
real-life daughter of Flamenco singer Domingo Alvarado, a Spaniard who settled 
in New York many years ago while touring with the late great Carmen Amaya. The 
New-York born Trini (whose mother is Puerto Rican) made her screen debut at age 
12 in the movie "Rich Kids." ELENA KELLNER

CINCO DE MAYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cinco de Mayo will be observed in Southern California this weekend with 
celebrations featuring Mexican music, dance and traditional foods. 
</P>
<P>
Cinco de Mayo commemorates an important victory in Mexican history and is 
recalled with pride by Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
On May 5, 1862, a small Mexican force overwhelmed 7,500 French troops in the 
town of Puebla. Although the French went on to dominate Mexico for five years, 
the Mexicans' success grew to symbolize the people's struggle against foreign 
domination.

CELEBRATE WITH CORN AND CHILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrate Cinco de Mayo with a dish that glorifies two staples of traditional 
Mexican cooking: corn and chiles. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Puebla is the site of the battle commemorated by this Mexican 
holiday. Therefore, this festive dish employs poblano (Puebla style) chiles. 
The chiles are stuffed with corn kernels combined with Mexican style cheeses. 
Cinnamon and cloves add a delicate spice flavor. 
</P>
<P>
For accompaniments, choose foods that are typical of Mexico -- beans and rice, 
salsa and tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
CORN-STUFFED CHILES 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
5 whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
4 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups plus 1/3 cup Mexican cream (crema) or sour cream 
</P>
<P>
14 ounces queso fresco or ricotta 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces asadero cheese or mozzarella, cut into small pieces 
</P>
<P>
12 poblano chiles, roasted and peeled 
</P>
<P>
3 to 4 ounces Chihuahua or mild Cheddar cheese, grated 
</P>
<P>
Heat butter in medium saucepan. Add onion, cloves and cinnamon and cook gently 
until onion is tender but not browned. Remove and discard cloves. Add corn 
kernels and salt. If using fresh corn, add 1/3 cup water. Cook over medium heat 
20 minutes for fresh corn, 10 minutes for frozen corn. Add 1/3 cup Mexican 
cream and cook 10 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. 
Combine queso fresco, asadero cheese and 1/3 cup Mexican cream. Add half the 
corn mixture, mix well and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Cut a small slit in one side of each chile. Rinse carefully to remove seeds and 
veins. Do not remove stems. Stuff chiles with corn-cheese mixture. Chiles 
should be plump but must close at slit. Heat remaining cream. Place chiles side 
by side in round baking dish 12 inches in diameter and 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep 
or in other shallow baking dish. Pour cream over chiles and sprinkle with 
Chihuahua cheese. Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees until chiles are 
heated through and cheese is melted, about 45 minutes. Reheat remaining corn 
mixture. Use to garnish chiles or serve on the side as a relish. 
</P>
<P>
Makes 12 servings.

PESTICIDE POLLUTION FOUND IN WATERWAYS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: MUGU LAGOON AND ITS TRIBUTARIES ARE SO CONTAMINATED THAT GROUND 
WATER COULD BE TAINTED AND WILDLIFE IS THREATENED, THE STATE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County's largest marine wetlands and wildlife sanctuary at Point Mugu 
and its tributaries are targeted for state cleanup because of high levels of 
pesticides found in the water, according to state water authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticide levels in the Revolon Slough and Calleguas Creek, which collect 
agricultural runoff before emptying into Mugu Lagoon, are so high that they 
could contaminate ground water beneath the streams, said Anne Saffell, chief of 
planning at the regional Water Resources Control Board office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the streams no longer support healthy fish populations, and the 
pesticide levels could harm rare and endangered species of birds at the lagoon, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have identified those as high priority areas and will probably spend a 
large amount of money to clean them up," Saffell said. 
</P>
<P>
The findings of high levels of pesticides, including the now banned DDT and 
chlordane, along with the presence of PCBs, a type of industrial pollutant, 
were part of a recently released report from the state Water Resources Control 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
Called the state's most comprehensive report on water quality, the 1990 Water 
Quality Assessment evaluated rivers and streams, lakes, ground water, estuaries 
and harbors in Ventura County and statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment is the first step in the water board's effort to discover 
pollution problems and set priorities for cleaning them up, Saffell said. 
</P>
<P>
Contaminants in Ventura County have two predominant sources: runoff from 
agriculture fields and storm drains. The state board asks growers to use what 
are called "best management practices" when discharging runoff from their 
fields. But there are no specific requirements, state authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Storm drains collect street debris including rubber particles from tires and 
oil that leaks from crankcases along with whatever else is dumped into gutters. 
The Water Quality Assessment named the Mugu Lagoon, Revolon Slough and 
Calleguas Creek as impaired water bodies, the designation the state assigns to 
the most highly contaminated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Neither county nor state authorities could specify whether fish taken from 
areas designated as impaired are safe to eat. But officials stressed that 
county authorities routinely monitor and post notices in areas that are 
considered unhealthful for fishing or recreation. No warnings are posted at the 
creek, the slough or the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three bodies of surface water designated as impaired, the 
report found ground water is impaired in three areas: the Santa Rosa Valley, 
the Santa Clara River Valley and the Simi Valley. In those areas, contaminants 
included pesticides, sulfates, nitrates and bacteria from sewage treatment 
plants upstream. 
</P>
<P>
No drinking water is pumped from the Simi Valley area, but the Santa Rosa and 
Santa Clara River areas still produce water for drinking and agriculture, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's two major rivers, the Santa Clara and the Ventura, were designated 
as having intermediate water quality, indicating lower levels of contaminants 
than those found in impaired bodies. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the lower Santa Clara River is suspected of containing 
heavy metals and pesticides. The Ventura River is suspected of contamination 
from pesticides and discharge from oil operations. 
</P>
<P>
Piru Creek and Sespe Creek have good water quality, according to the report. 
The Ventura River, in the unpopulated northern part of the county, also had 
good water quality, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Casitas, which supplies drinking water to much of the city of Ventura, was 
designated as intermediate quality, with suspected "elevated levels of 
pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
Mugu Lagoon was in the worst shape by far for area estuaries, with all 1,500 
square miles considered impaired. But the McGrath Lake estuary at McGrath State 
Beach in Oxnard had 40 acres of intermediate quality water due to suspected 
pesticide contamination, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the Ventura River estuary is unknown, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
None of Ventura County's three harbors were found to be highly polluted, but 
all three -- the Channel Islands, Port of Hueneme and Ventura -- have 
intermediate water quality because of suspected contamination from heavy 
metals. The Port of Hueneme has possible contamination from PCBs as well, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Smith, who compiled the Water Quality Assessment for the state, said 
the Water Resources Control Board would like to keep waterways safe for 
recreation and fishing as well as for fish and wildlife habitats. 
</P>
<P>
Although the contaminants may present little hazard to man in the small 
quantities that are found in area waterways, biologists say, the pesticides and 
metals pose a much greater hazard as they work their way up the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Dow, who heads the environmental division at the Pacific Missile Test 
Center at Point Mugu, used the endangered peregrine falcon that migrates 
through the lagoon as an example. 
</P>
<P>
As a bird of prey, it sits at the top of the food chain, eating birds that feed 
on fish or shellfish that eat worms that get nutrients from sediment, where the 
contaminants are stored. 
</P>
<P>
"The terns that eat the fish may not be affected themselves," Dow said. "But 
the terns taken by the peregrine have very high levels of pesticides, so their 
diet has high concentrations." 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins that stay near shore have high levels of pesticides in their tissues, 
Dow said. And even the harbor seals that loaf in the sun on the protected 
shores of the Mugu Lagoon could have significant levels of pesticides in their 
body fat, Dow said. 
</P>
<P>
Dow and a team of biologists are studying the possible effects of DDT on the 
brittle eggs of the endangered clapper rail, a bird that nests at Mugu Lagoon. 
That pesticide was blamed for the decline of the peregrine and other species 
during the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Reed Smith, Southern California hazardous spill coordinator for the state Fish 
and Game Department, said the chemicals found at the lagoon have not yet caused 
deformities in animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not seeing the crippled critters that have shown up at Kesterson," Smith 
said, referring to deformed birds found at the Los Banos area wildlife refuge 
that is an agricultural drain as well. "But there is a good possibility that we 
could end up with them here." 
</P>
<P>
The state plans to clean up the waterways that feed into Mugu Lagoon and to 
prevent other areas designated as intermediate quality from becoming more 
polluted, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Saffell said part of the plan for cleanup and prevention will include 
discussions with area growers on how they can reduce the amount of pesticides 
that finds its way into the creeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We also want to be sure nobody out there is using DDT," Saffell said. "We 
don't think it's possible 10 years after it is no longer available, but we want 
to be sure." 
</P>
<P>
The state will assign contracts for the cleanup in the next five or six months 
and plans to finish it by 1992, she said. 
</P>
<P>

SCHOOL MOVED TO TOP OF STATE FUNDING LIST 
</P>

<P>
Oxnard has been moved to the top of a state funding priority list for a new 
high school because the present one is 1,700 feet from the end of the Oxnard 
Airport runway, school officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state will not fund the project, which will cost at least $20 
million, unless voters approve a statewide bond measure on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would provide $800 million for school construction and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Carter, superintendent of the Oxnard Union High School District, said air 
safety was a factor in the state's decision to put Oxnard so high on its 
emergency funding list. 
</P>
<P>
"Noise is a factor, but the bigger issue is the safety factor," Carter said. 
"The school was there before the airport, but as the school, and particularly 
the airport, have grown, there's been more activity, and safety has become more 
of an issue." 
</P>
<P>
District officials discussed the new facility at a meeting Tuesday of the 
Education Partnership Program, a coalition of business owners, school officials 
and community leaders that meets monthly to discuss education-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard High School Principal Ruperto Cisneros said the new school, which would 
be near Patterson and Gonzales roads, would be 10,000 square feet larger than 
the present school. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is expected to be completed by the 1993-94 school year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the present Oxnard High School facilities will be turned over to the 
state, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in the 11,200-student district is projected to double by the year 
2006, Carter said. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

SCHOOLS WEIGH Y'S CHILD-CARE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Oak Park Unified School District is studying a proposal from the Triunfo 
YMCA to provide preschool and after-school child care for students in the 
Agoura area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the YMCA, which covers Westlake Village, Agoura and Oak Park, 
presented the child-care proposal to the school district's Board of Trustees 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
YMCA Executive Director Pete Regli said his organization would put a portable 
building behind the school district office on Conifer Street and would offer 
various programs at a cost comparable to other preschool and child-care 
programs. Regli said the program would offer sliding-scale payments to 
low-income parents. 
</P>
<P>
The YMCA has not figured out how to come up with the initial financing for the 
preschool, Regli said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an up-front cost of about $40,000 that we can't afford right now," he 
said. "But the ongoing costs would be paid by the people who use the center." 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary plan is to open a preschool, then expand to after-school child 
care, Regli said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do get a lot of calls from people asking for preschool and child-care 
programs," he said. "We have a problem referring them because there just aren't 
that many preschools." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was generally well-received by the trustees, who asked Regli to 
return when he has firmer cost estimates and a more detailed plan for programs 
that would be offer. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has 1,580 students at two elementary schools, a middle 
school and a high school. KAREN McKEAN

LONG BEACH MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO RAPE AND KIDNAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach man has pleaded guilty to the June, 1989, rape and abduction of a 
Torrance woman who was kidnaped after an early morning accident in which her 
car was rear-ended. 
</P>
<P>
In a plea bargain, Larry Earl Climmons, 29, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 15 
felonies, including kidnaping and rape, but avoided the possibility of a life 
sentence without parole. The deal was struck as a jury was about to be selected 
in Torrance Superior Court for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is set for May 29 before Superior Court Judge Jean Matusinka. 
</P>
<P>
Still awaiting trial in connection with the incident is Jerome Young, 27, also 
of Long Beach, who was driving the car that struck the victim's car. Young's 
trial is set for May 15. 
</P>
<P>
In his guilty plea, Climmons avoided the possibility of an automatic life 
sentence without possibility of parole when the prosecutor agreed to drop a 
charge of kidnaping for extortion. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty to 15 lesser crimes, including kidnaping for robbery, rape, 
rape with a foreign object and rape in concert. Kidnaping for robbery has an 
automatic sentence of life with possible parole, and maximum sentences on the 
other crimes are eight and nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Julie Sulman said the plea bargain also included an 
agreement that Climmons would be sentenced only on the kidnaping and on a 
single rape charge. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Douglas McCann, said he expected his client to serve about nine 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Young is charged with the same felonies as Climmons and with being a felon in 
possession of a firearm. The count stems from Young's conviction for a 1987 
residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Sulman said the incident began about 2 a.m. on June 1, 1989, when a Torrance 
woman driving home from a friend's house was rear-ended near Arlington Avenue 
and Del Amo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
After she got out of her car to exchange insurance information with the driver, 
she was grabbed from behind by another man, forced into the other car and hit 
on the head with a gun, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was molested and raped by Climmons as the car was driven to Compton, 
Sulman said, and then the two men switched places. In addition to the assaults, 
Sulman said, the woman was forced to withdraw about $120 from an automatic 
teller machine after the men discovered her card in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
The two men abandoned her and the car, which was stolen, and the woman drove 
back to Torrance, where she contacted authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Climmons and Young, who live in the same apartment building in Long Beach, were 
arrested after a police stakeout several weeks after the incident. Police had 
found a fingerprint in the car that matched one of Climmons' and the woman 
identified Climmons from a photograph.

STATE ASSESSMENT TEAM TO RETURN TO CENTINELA FOR MORE HEARINGS; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: SOME PARENTS, STUDENTS AND BOARD MEMBERS SAID THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO 
SPEAK FREELY IN LAST MONTH'S SESSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The head of a state team assessing racial tensions in the Centinela Valley 
Union High School District said Tuesday that misunderstandings about his 
group's role may be at the root of recently voiced concerns about the fairness 
of the team's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an investigation. We're not looking for facts to be corroborated 
so that charges could be made," said Marlin Foxworth of the state Department of 
Education's Office of Intergroup Relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for perceptions, for how folks feel . . . so that we can make 
recommendations to reinforce the good things about the district or change the 
things people feel ought to be different." 
</P>
<P>
His comments came after several parents and students told school board members 
and others that they were not given an opportunity to speak freely during any 
of the more than 50 sessions held April 17-20 by Foxworth's assessment team. 
School board members also have criticized the agency for excluding them from 
the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the criticisms and to smooth the way for its recommendations 
about how to ease racial tensions, the assessment team will return May 14 to 
conduct a new round of group interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The original meetings were scheduled in response to allegations that racism is 
rampant in the district. Although tensions have existed in the racially diverse 
district for years, they came to a head in early March as students staged two 
days of walkouts. They were protesting the resignation of a popular black 
principal who said he was being unfairly reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
The state assessors typically interview only students, parents, teachers and 
community members, but not school board members or the district's 
superintendent. The Office of Intergroup Relations, which conducts between six 
and 10 assessments statewide every year, takes that approach to "preserve the 
integrity and independence" of school officials, said Bart Aspling, Foxworth's 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
But on April 19, school board President Ruth Morales told Foxworth that board 
members wanted to attend some sessions. Foxworth explained that the policy 
insulates a school board from criticism that it has influenced the agency's 
findings or recommendations, he said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Foxworth said he agreed to discuss the matter with his colleagues and 
get back to Morales on April 23. He left a message on her answering machine on 
April 24 saying the team would allow board members to participate in a new 
round of sessions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
They did not speak, however, and later that day, Morales sent a letter to 
Foxworth and State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig that raised questions 
about the fairness of the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Morales was in Mexico and could not be reached for comment this week. But board 
member Pam Sturgeon, who saw the letter before it was sent, said she concurred 
with Morales. 
</P>
<P>
"The board is the one that asked for this (assessment) originally on Jan. 23," 
Sturgeon said. "But we were totally ignored until the walkouts (on March 5 and 
6), and all of a sudden they're down here talking to people. In my opinion, it 
makes the board look bad because everyone is saying the board isn't doing 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing else, I feel the assessment team should have written a letter to 
the board explaining how they work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A steering committee composed of 38 people helped the assessment team identify 
groups that wanted to participate in the meetings. To schedule the greatest 
number of meetings, the four-member assessment team split into groups of two, 
eventually speaking to more than 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
Some sessions were devoted to students, others to teachers and others to the 
community at large. Each meeting was announced publicly, sign-up sheets were 
posted but attendance was restricted to no more than a dozen participants. As 
one assessor asked questions, the other took notes. 
</P>
<P>
The assessors made a point of having non-segregated meetings to allow racial 
tensions to surface in an open forum. 
</P>
<P>
Although many parents and teachers said they were happy with the 
sometimes-heated sessions, others said they felt shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jacqueline Carrerra said the racial mix of the meetings left many 
white and Latino parents and students feeling "intimidated, that at any point 
they may say something wrong and someone would climb down their throats. Other 
people there said they didn't like the atmosphere because of some of the people 
they had to sit with. I also heard they felt the assessment was not impartial." 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, the district's racial composition has undergone radical 
changes. Although blacks, at 17%, and Latinos, at 53%, account for the bulk of 
the student population, the district's faculty remains overwhelmingly Anglo. 
About 31% of the district's administrators are black, and four of the five 
school board members are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela Valley Secondary Teachers Assn. President Nancy Nuesseler, who was a 
member of the steering committee, said many teachers and parents were upset 
that they couldn't meet in private with the assessors. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a great deal of concern on the part of many people -- parents, 
teachers and students -- (about) the way the assessment was set up. A lot of 
people felt the meetings were stacked" against white teachers and parents, said 
Nuesseler, who is white. "Especially since some people showed up four or five 
times to meet with the assessment team." 
</P>
<P>
But Foxworth said it simply wasn't possible to schedule private meetings. The 
assessors were not swayed by the number of times someone showed up at a 
meeting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can hear a community with one-on-one sessions," Foxworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the fairness of an assessment are natural in school districts 
that have struggled to cope with mounting ethnic diversity, Foxworth said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "We're not as stupid as we look. I think people get really 
attuned to their point of view on an issue and start drawing conclusions about 
how easily manipulable are the people who hear them. But we're used to 
listening to people very carefully, and we're not too easily manipulable. 
Numbers are important in one sense, but they're not the only thing that shapes 
our conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
School board members, who were left out of previous meetings held by the 
Department of Education's Office of Intergroup Relations, will be allowed to 
attend sessions beginning May 14. They are also open to the public and, 
depending on the level of interest, may be held over several days. The 
assessment team is expected to issue its recommendations for easing racial 
tensions in the schools by the end of the month.

TENSE BUT QUIET DAY FOLLOWS SCHOOL BRAWL; 
</P>
<P>
INGLEWOOD: HALF OF THE STUDENTS AND MANY TEACHERS STAYED HOME AFTER VIOLENT 
CONFLICT BETWEEN BLACKS AND LATINOS. 
</P>

In the aftermath of a brawl between black and Latino students at Inglewood High 
School, no disturbances were reported on campus Wednesday but tensions remained 
high. Half of the students and many teachers stayed away from classes, and a 
beefed-up security crew confiscated a number of weapons from students on their 
way into school. 
</P>
<P>
In class, students wrote essays on the causes of Tuesday's fights. Supt. George 
McKenna, who spent most of the day on campus, said school psychologists, 
parents and members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference will hold 
workshops on conflict resolution today with selected black and Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an aide said County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn will ask the county 
Human Relations Committee to investigate the campus disturbances at next 
Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting. The Inglewood school board will also 
take up the disturbances at its meeting next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic pride turned to ethnic violence at the high school Tuesday when black 
students walked out on a Cinco de Mayo celebration to retaliate against Latinos 
who left a black history assembly in February. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's walkout, insults escalated into a series of fistfights that 
involved dozens of students, prompting administrators to end the school day 
early and call in Inglewood police. Police continued to patrol the area around 
the school Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Security guards reported seizing far more weapons than usual Wednesday morning, 
including guns, knives and a crowbar. District spokesman Maurice Wiley was 
unable to determine how many weapons were confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the school's 2,100 students returned to campus Wednesday morning. 
Wiley said teacher absences were also higher than normal, but he did not know 
specific numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the absentees was Principal Lawrence Freeman, who called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said in an interview Tuesday that he was seriously considering 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"How many times can you get your heart broken?" the 67-year-old educator asked. 
"I think our race (blacks) should be ashamed of itself. These blacks better get 
busy. They need to stop fighting and start competing." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, students said blacks and Latinos have not 
clashed in the past at Inglewood High, although the two groups are socially 
separate and tensions do exist in the student body, which is 53% black, 43% 
Latino, 2% white and 2% other. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly it's blacks around blacks and Mexicans around Mexicans, but I didn't 
know there was prejudice until (the fighting broke out)," said Gonzalo 
Curuchet, 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't always get along with the black people here," said Alex Quintanilla, 
18. "They think they're superior to us. We work so hard to learn English. We 
work so hard to get jobs. We work so hard in our lives and they call us names." 
</P>
<P>
Black students said they think Latinos get favored treatment at the school. 
They said Freeman enforces the dress code more strictly for black girls, only 
has Latino girls working in the front office and gave more support to the Cinco 
de Mayo celebration than to Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
"They got a trip to Olvera Street," Maneka Hubbard, 16, said of her Latino 
classmates. "They got a dance. They even named our cafeteria El Casa Maria." 
</P>
<P>
Black students said school officials would not allow them to select a Black 
History Month queen. Tuesday's walkout occurred while Freeman was distributing 
flowers to the contestants for Cinco de Mayo queen. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said Tuesday that nobody ever asked him for a Black History Month 
queen. He denied that favoritism exists at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't try to read too much into this," Freeman said. "The whole thing is a 
bunch of punks who walked out and started this. Don't give it the dignity of 
racial strife. It's a bunch of non-thinking children doing the wrong thing." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna agreed Wednesday that the racial problems are not as widespread as they 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 95% of the kids are surprised this occurred and have no idea what 
happened or why," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said he has not known Freeman to exhibit favoritism, "but there may be 
the perception that in making one group feel welcome he has made another group 
feel unwelcome." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators were not the only ones assessing the reasons for Tuesday's 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
Chaka Jones, 17, attributed the fighting to "a lot of built-up hostilities" and 
said: "It doesn't matter who threw the first punch. The question is why did 
punches continue to be thrown?" 
</P>
<P>
Students said tensions between the two groups escalated in February when a 
large group of Latino students walked out of a black history assembly that 
featured Duke Ellington music, a tap dancing performance and brief history 
lessons about prominent blacks. 
</P>
<P>
When Latinos staged a Mexican folk dancing demonstration and other activities 
in honor of Cinco de Mayo in the gym Tuesday, a group of between 10 and 15 
black students walked out. More joined in. Soon both black and Latino students 
were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the gym, students said, insults were exchanged and sporadic fighting 
began. When administrators tried to break up one fight, another would begin. 
After school was dismissed, the disturbances moved outside and many students 
rushed into the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks were fighting Hispanics and Hispanics were fighting blacks," said 
Johnnie Thomas, the district's security chief. "Then all hell broke loose."

DRUNK DRIVING CASE ENDS IN SENTENCE, SHATTERED LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Ayares' teen-age social life revolved around alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Before heading off for classes at Rolling Hills High School, he would down a 
shot or two to help him face the day. After school, he and his friends spent 
the afternoon drinking beer and watching television. By the time the weekend 
rolled around, they were ready for some serious partying. 
</P>
<P>
On at least 30 or 40 occasions, Ayares admitted to a probation officer, he 
drove home drunk without being stopped by police. 
</P>
<P>
"We all saw our drinking as a big game," Ayares said in a letter to the judge 
preparing to sentence him in the drunk driving death of a friend. "I learned it 
wasn't a game the hardest way of all." 
</P>
<P>
Speeding away from police in a drunken panic one night last January, Ayares, 
19, slammed the brand-new Acura he was driving into a parked car, killing one 
of his passengers, Rick Jackson, 19, and seriously injuring the other, Jean 
Paul Marnoni, 20. The three had graduated together in 1988 from Rolling Hills 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Torrance Superior Court Judge William Hollingsworth ordered Ayares 
to state prison for four years and eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Ayares must serve at least two years and four months before he becomes eligible 
for parole. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot think of any crime that calls out more for punishment than this 
does," Hollingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that by your sentence to state prison some of your drinking buddies 
will get the message that they cannot drink and drive without suffering the 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Ayares, who pleaded no contest in February to felony drunk driving and 
vehicular manslaughter, told the judge in his letter that he hopes so too. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that many of the friends we used to drink with still go out partying on 
weekends. They still see it as a big game," Ayares wrote. "I know that what I 
want to do with my life is to help kids understand how serious it is to drink 
and drive." 
</P>
<P>
His father, sister and counselors at the residential alcohol treatment program 
where he has been living since shortly after the accident told Hollingsworth 
the tragedy has turned Ayares' life around. 
</P>
<P>
Diagnosed as dyslexic, Ayares was enrolled in special schools for learning 
disabled children and took a drug called Ritalin twice a day for more than six 
years to control hyperactivity, court documents show. Some doctors now believe 
Ritalin can contribute to alcohol and chemical dependency later in life. 
</P>
<P>
Her voice cracking with emotion in court, 22-year-old Allison Ayares testified 
that her brother has been transformed from "a very closed person, very scared, 
very haunted," to a remorseful young man who is sincerely trying to better 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to pay his debt to society. He realizes what he's done," she said. 
"He's going to have to live with that debt for the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the prosecutor nor Jackson's family were sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Keith Schwartz, who asked Hollingsworth to sentence Ayares 
to six years and eight months in state prison, argued that Ayares' good 
intentions are too little and far too late. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have the rest of his life . . . to maybe make himself a better 
person. And I hope he does," Schwartz said. "But Rick Jackson . . . had 
everything going for him, and now he's never going to achieve his life's 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's family said the USC sophomore was a high achieving student who 
decided early on that he wanted to be a doctor. Rolling Hills High School 
athletic commissioner during his senior year there and Alpha Tau Omega pledge 
class president during his first year in college, Jackson volunteered at 
County-USC Hospital's trauma center every Saturday night and worked with 
underprivileged children at Hoover Recreational Center in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He was, his parents said, just the opposite of Ayares. 
</P>
<P>
Clay and Marsha Jackson said Ayares "drank excessively, lied to his friends and 
acquaintances, stole from his employers, drove without concern for safety, 
wrecked more than one vehicle and displayed a general disregard of authority," 
according to Probation Officer Caroline Nakamura's report to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Ayares "would brag constantly about his escapades, from spitting in all the 
hamburgers he made when working at Burger King Palos Verdes to stealing liquor 
and selling to under-age minors while employed at Matador Liquors," the 
Jacksons told Nakamura. 
</P>
<P>
Managers at both businesses said they fired Ayares, according to the probation 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The Jacksons had their lawyer serve a wrongful death lawsuit on Ayares moments 
before he was sentenced to state prison, and silently watched Tuesday's 
courtroom proceedings. They left immediately afterward without comment. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Paul Marnoni, who nearly died as a result of serious back and internal 
injuries suffered during the January crash, did not go to the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed feelings right now toward Rich (Ayares), in the sense that he was 
a good friend of mine, but Rick (Jackson) was my best friend . . . since fourth 
grade," Marnoni said in a telephone interview from his Rancho Palos Verdes 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson usually was the one who stayed sober to drive everyone else home, 
Marnoni said. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 7, however, Ayares, who attended Harbor College, offered to do the 
driving and both Marnoni and Jackson, exhausted from their week's studies at 
USC and the night's festivities, accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"Rich is a really big kid and he handles his alcohol well, I guess, because he 
didn't seem all that drunk to me," Marnoni said. "It was a stupid move on both 
our parts." 
</P>
<P>
Marnoni said he and Jackson fell asleep on the way home and did not awaken 
until police were chasing them, shortly before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up and I was kind of in a daze and I saw these flashing lights behind 
us . . . and I think I said, 'Rich, what are you doing? Slow down! Pull over!' 
" Marnoni said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember a whole lot . . . about that night." 
</P>
<P>
Ayares, whose blood alcohol level of .19% was more than twice the legal limit, 
told counselors that he is tortured by vivid nightmares about that night. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish it had been me instead (who died). . . . I've always felt that I wasn't 
worth very much," Ayares said in his letter to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Allison Ayares told counselors that she and her brother, both of whom were 
adopted, suffered through rocky childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Their mother "raised us with a lot of fear and stress," a psychologist's report 
filed with the court quotes Allison as saying. "She would scratch us with her 
nails and pull our hair." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the childrens' father, Howard Ayares, went bankrupt. Shortly 
afterward, the couple divorced. In 1984, he and the two children moved from 
their Miami home to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Richard Ayares already was drinking heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overweight and had nothing going for me," he told psychologists, 
according to court documents. "I really saw myself as a fat piece of garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Now determined to start over, Ayares said he is determined to build enough 
self-esteem to stay sober. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish more than anything that I could bring Rick back," he wrote in his 
letter to Hollingsworth. "It's really frightening to know that I'll have to go 
on living with what I've done."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOSPITAL TO SELL LAND FOR $4.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, which has struggled for a year to improve its 
finances, is about to sell a parcel of land that holds parking lots and an old 
medical building. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to sell it and raise money for capital projects," hospital President 
John Wilson said Tuesday at a public meeting in San Pedro where he released a 
report on the hospital's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the hospital has accepted a $4.7-million offer for 17 contiguous 
lots between 6th and 7th streets. He said the identity of the buyer, a local 
individual, would not be released until the deal is closed. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital plans to use the money to improve the facilities of its maternal 
and child health programs. 
</P>
<P>
The land sale is part of the hospital's drive to pull itself back from severe 
financial difficulty. At the beginning of 1989, it had accumulated losses of $9 
million on an annual budget of $85 million. Last year it laid off employees, 
cut back costly or money-losing programs and expanded programs that made the 
most profit. By the end of 1989, the deficit had been reduced to $1.3 million, 
Wilson said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO HOMES AT MARINELAND SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Monaghan Co. has dropped its plan to build homes at the former Marineland 
site in Rancho Palos Verdes but still plans to construct a 495-room hotel and 
nine-hole golf course on the land, company spokeswoman Joan Hanley said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came less than two weeks after City Council members agreed to 
allow the company to seek a zoning change to build 45 homes on the land. 
</P>
<P>
The 102-acre site is currently designated for commercial and recreational use. 
The council also required that the company replace any open space lost to the 
project with a comparable amount of open space elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials, who wanted to build 65 homes on the site, argued that such a 
project would be economically unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
The company had said it would give the city 100 acres of unspecified land it 
owns in an area of the city known as the Filiorum. However, Hanley said Monday 
that the company hopes to build an 18-hole golf course in the Filiorum area, in 
addition to the nine-hole course planned at the Marineland site. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the company's Filiorum-area land is in a building moratorium 
zone because of past landslides in the area.

MAN OF MANY ALIASES RETURNS TO COURTHOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD CASE: AUTHORITIES SAY THEY HAVE A CON ARTIST IN CUSTODY WHO HAS CHEATED 
VENTURA BUSINESSES AND OJAI RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought you'd heard the last of him -- and his 11 aliases -- 
David Michael Murray, also known as Shi Stone and Shane Peterson, has returned 
to the courts of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Murray -- an alleged con artist who claims to be a misunderstood 17-year-old -- 
appeared at a Ventura Muncipal Court hearing on Wednesday to determine whether 
he will stand trial on 12 counts of defrauding Ventura businesses and Ojai 
residents of more than $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that Murray is a 31-year-old con artist with a criminal 
record in six states. He is being held without bail in the Ventura County Jail 
because of charges that he twice violated his parole -- once in Texas and once 
in Ventura, where he was convicted of auto theft in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But for four weeks beginning in late January, Murray claimed to be Shi Stone, 
the hemophiliac son of an Army officer wounded in the U.S. invasion of Panama. 
By the time he was arrested, many Ojai residents believed his story. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the 12 counts Murray faces are two that were refiled by the 
district attorney's office after a municipal court judge dismissed them in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
One of the counts charges Murray with defrauding his benefactors, Ken and 
Dorothy Johnson, of room and board expenses. The Ojai couple sheltered the boy 
for four weeks, believing that he was Shi Stone. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office also refiled a charge that Murray bilked a local 
pharmacist of a blood coagulant worth $1,600 to treat his hemophilia -- a 
condition that prevents blood from clotting normally. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office also filed another seven felony and three 
misdemeanor counts for incidents in which Murray allegedly bilked hotel keepers 
and store owners in Ventura out of money for products and services. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 hotel clerks and business owners testified Wednesday that Murray 
allegedly used similar scams to defraud them before taking up residence with 
the Johnsons. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Lee Stratton, a desk clerk at the Holiday Inn Beach Resort in Ventura, 
said a man who identified himself as Randy Phillips arrived at the hotel and 
reported that his luggage had been lost. He told her his money and credit cards 
were in the bags but that the airline would soon contact the hotel about 
restitution, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was distraught about it so I gave him the best room and he said he'd get 
back to me as soon as he could," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton said Wednesday in court that she was "75% sure" that Phillips and 
Murray are the same man. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has yet to receive the $116 payment for Murray's two-night stay in 
early January, Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles R. Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses testified that Murray impersonated a fashion model, an officer 
in the U.S. Air Force and the son of a photographer for the television show 
"Wide World of Sports." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Murray would follow up his claims with official-looking Western 
Union telegrams that promised money from the companies that he said would be 
paying his expenses, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Wednesday from witnesses called by prosecutors, Robert James 
III, a physician and director of the laboratory at the Ventura County Medical 
Center, said that two tests performed on Murray's blood showed that he was not 
a classic hemophiliac, as he had claimed. But James could not rule out the 
possibility that Murray had a less common type of hemophilia. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge John E. Dobroth is expected to decide today if Murray 
will stand trial on the 12 charges after hearing testimony from about 15 more 
witnesses.

MEMBERS SEEKING TO PURCHASE COUNTRY CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Ventura County's most exclusive country clubs is about to become even 
more exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the North Ranch Country Club in Thousand Oaks are planning to buy 
their own club and the championship golf course that surrounds it for $28 
million in a deal that would make it the priciest in the county, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Club members on Monday will launch a sale of memberships to finance the 
purchase from Prudential Insurance Co. of America, said Leonard Alexander, an 
attorney and board president of the organization representing the 600 members. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's a good investment, and we'll have control of the management of 
the operation," Alexander said. "We're real pleased to make this thing 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said he was confident that the funds would be raised through the sale 
of memberships and private financing. Memberships would be offered first to 
club members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To finance the purchase, 400 memberships need to be sold. Memberships for golf 
course privileges would cost $42,500, with an additional $4,250 for tennis 
court privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Country club members now pay about $15,000 for the privilege of using the 
greens but are unable to sell their memberships. 
</P>
<P>
Members initiated the purchase to gain control over operation of the country 
club and its facilities, Alexander added. The 27-hole golf course, 12 tennis 
courts and dining rooms sit on rolling hills north of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The sale would transfer control of the club to members and change the 
membership to an equity or share in ownership of the operation. At equity 
clubs, a person's membership can be sold, with certain conditions and fees. 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed organization of club members may be able to buy the 250-acre 
property and 49,000 square feet of buildings for $3 million less if the money 
is raised before Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential acquired the property in 1973, then developed the golf course and 
tennis courts. The sale is part of a decision to sell off Prudential's share in 
golf courses and country clubs, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey-based company still owns real estate, hotels and recreational 
facilities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the North Ranch Country Club held a tournament for the NCAA 
Division I golf championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County has 20 golf courses, seven of which are private with membership 
fees ranging from $25,000 to $40,000. Members usually agree to pay monthly dues 
and to spend a minimum amount in the country club bar or restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
North Ranch directors said the membership price is on a par with other private 
golf courses in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. An appraiser has told North 
Ranch Country Club officials that a membership was worth at least $60,000, 
director John Baloff said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our opinion we are selling it at a discount," Baloff said. 
"Traditionally, for the last 20 or 30 years, golf courses have all gone up in 
price." 
</P>
<P>
When directors polled members of the club, 417 people signed letters agreeing 
to the purchase, Baloff said. 
</P>
<P>
One city official applauded the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good deal for the members and the city," said Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex 
Fiore, who is also a golfer but does not belong to North Ranch. "I don't know 
what other golf courses are going for today, but it is a competitive fee."

L.A. SCHOOLS ISSUE REPRIMANDS OVER CHEATING ON TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite an inability to fix blame in the CAP-test cheating scandal, the Los 
Angeles Unified School District has sent disciplinary letters to several 
teachers, administrators and classroom aides, chastising them for contributing 
to a "breakdown in the testing protocols" that allowed test-tampering to occur. 
</P>
<P>
The letters went to employees who worked at schools where cheating was alleged 
to have occurred on California Assessment Tests given from 1986 to 1988. In 
most cases, students' incorrect answers were erased and changed on the tests, 
which were later invalidated because of the tampering. 
</P>
<P>
"While we have no direct evidence of your involvement, and you have denied any 
wrongdoing, it is the district's best judgment that you are, at least in part, 
responsible for a breakdown in the testing protocols and procedures in the 
administration of the test," the letters, which were sent last week, state. 
</P>
<P>
Considered formal reprimands, the letters will be placed in personnel files, 
though teachers union officials say some teachers may file grievances to keep 
the letters from marring their records. 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers have called the union, saying they are "incensed at the blanket 
accusation by the district, without any foundation at all," said United 
Teachers-Los Angeles spokeswoman Catherine Carey. The district officially 
closed its 18-month investigation into the test-tampering incidents this week, 
announcing that appropriate action had been taken against those involved and 
that security surrounding test administration had been tightened to prevent 
future cheating. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation found that district procedures surrounding administration of 
the standardized tests were so lax that it was difficult to determine who had 
altered the answer sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Until safeguards were agreed upon by the district and teachers union in 
December, 1988, tests were commonly stored in unlocked areas, answer sheets 
were left in the hands of teachers and aides for several days before or after 
tests were given, and an array of school employees were allowed to "clean up" 
answer sheets by erasing student doodles or writing over student responses to 
make them more legible. 
</P>
<P>
New procedures call for closer supervision during the testing process and for 
tests to be placed in sealed plastic bags immediately after they are completed. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP tests are administered each year to students in third, sixth, eighth 
and 12th grades throughout the state to measure the effectiveness of school 
districts in teaching basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
The state detected the cheating in 1987 when a computer check of student answer 
sheets found an abnormally high number of erasures on forms turned in by 40 
schools across the state. Further investigation found irregularities on answer 
sheets at 25 Los Angeles schools.

Tracking Drug Money 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 127 to 283, the House defeated the stricter of two proposals for 
banks to keep records of international wire transfers that could involve drug 
money. The proposal was for a Treasury Department pilot program in which 
selected banks would have had to keep track of customers wiring large sums 
overseas. Left intact by the vote was the softer approach, supported by bank 
lobbyists, of letting Treasury draft regulations address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pilot program.

Budget Plan 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 106 to 305, the House rejected a blueprint for the government's 
$1.2-trillion fiscal 1991 budget. Popular among Republicans, the measure called 
for higher defense and lowersocial spending than the Democratic budget plan (HR 
310) it sought to replace. But it was less generous to defense than President 
Bush's budget. Its main feature was to freeze defense and domestic spending 
other than for entitlement programs at 1990 levels. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House worked toward approval of a 1991 congressional 
budget resolution that will guide later action on individual spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the GOP-backed budget plan.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN PICKING THE BEST, BIRD GOES BY THE BOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of years ago, Red Auerbach called Larry Bird the greatest basketball 
player who ever lived. Bob Knight says that Michael Jordan is the best ever. 
Pat Riley would vote for Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Bird wouldn't vote for any of them. He told the Boston Globe: "You can't tell 
me that Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain weren't the two greatest basketball 
players ever. How can you say that individually Chamberlain wasn't the greatest 
ever? 
</P>
<P>
"Every five years, they talk about somebody else. First it was me and Magic. 
Now Michael is thrown in there. And the next thing you know, Karl Malone is 
gonna be thrown in there with David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, right now, in our time, we're good basketball players. But if you want to 
say someone is better than Wilt Chamberlain, all you've got to do is get the 
record book out. The man scored 100 points in one game and led the league in 
assists." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When Dancer's Image was disqualified in the 1968 Kentucky Derby 
after failing to pass the drug test, who was declared the winner? 
</P>
<P>
Take your choice: Said Houston outfielder Gerald Young, after Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar refused to autograph a basketball for him at the Astrodome: "He 
stiffed me. He completely brushed me off. I had gone out and bought a new 
basketball and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Said Abdul-Jabbar, giving his version: "I was getting into the limousine, and 
some guy comes up to me screaming and yelling. I couldn't tell what he wanted. 
It was nuts. I just wanted to get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: "The 50 most beautiful people in the world," as selected 
by People magazine, included four people from the world of sports: Isiah Thomas 
(basketball), Ryne Sandberg (baseball), Danny Sullivan (auto racing) and Sinjin 
Smith (volleyball). 
</P>
<P>
Funny guy: Cleveland Indian coach Rich Dauer, the club's leading gagster, 
introduced Keith Hernandez as follows, at the annual Wahoo Club luncheon: "I 
didn't know this man too well until we got to spring training, but I now 
consider him to be my best friend. I'm sure when you get to know him, you'll 
consider him your best friend, too. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Sid Fernandez." 
</P>
<P>
It figures: Andy Wolfson of the Louisville Courier-Journal said he heard 
basketball analyst Doug Collins say on Turner Network, "Any time Detroit scores 
more than 100 points and holds the other team below 100 points, they almost 
always win." 
</P>
<P>
You believe it?: Said Mike Tyson, when asked about rumors that he is still 
carousing: "You can look at me. I'm in pretty good shape. I haven't been 
fooling around. I even gave up my best hobby -- women." 
</P>
<P>
Dept. of irony: Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka, who donated $100,000 to the 
University of Pittsburgh for scholarships, never graduated from Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Forward Pass.

MARY STAR BOUNCES BACK FROM BIG LOSS, WINS 8 IN ROW

<TEXT>
<P>
This was supposed to be a rebuilding year for the baseball team at Mary Star of 
the Sea High School in San Pedro. Or did you forget that the Stars graduated 16 
seniors from last season's Santa Fe League champion team? 
</P>
<P>
Coach Frank Ponce De Leon was reminded of his personnel losses March 23 when 
league favorite Miraleste hammered Mary Star, 26-2. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, though, the Stars have been perfect. They extended a winning streak 
to eight games Tuesday with a 4-3 victory over Cantwell. Included in the streak 
is a 4-1 pay-back over Miraleste last week, a victory that pushed Mary Star 
(12-4-1 overall) into a first-place tie with the Marauders. 
</P>
<P>
"For a team that wasn't supposed to do anything this year, I'm very pleased," 
Ponce De Leon said. "We have a lot of talent on the younger levels." 
</P>
<P>
With only two returning seniors, the Stars had to rely on underclassmen. They 
have 13 non-seniors on the varsity roster, six of whom start. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the team's youth, Ponce De Leon said he had to bring the squad along 
slowly. He concedes he might have expected too much early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat down (after the loss to Miraleste) and told the kids they are a better 
ball club than this," he said. "I think as coaches we realized we can't expect 
every team to be like the team last year. We had 16 new faces." 
</P>
<P>
One of the new faces was already familiar to Ponce De Leon. His youngest 
brother, Mark, a junior, plays third base and pitches, and has been a thorn in 
the side of third-place Cantwell. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ponce De Leon hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning Tuesday at Cantwell 
to give the Stars a 4-2 lead. Last month, his two-run, pinch-hit home run in 
the bottom of the seventh tied the score and sparked Mary Star to a 4-3 win 
over Cantwell at Fromhold Field in San Pedro. They are his only home runs of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"He sort of owns them right now," said his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
Others who have figured prominently in Mary Star's surprising season are junior 
shortstop Stephen Nitta (team-leading .480 batting average) and three seniors: 
second baseman Nick Rugnetta (.438), center fielder Steve Papadakis (.423) and 
pitcher-third baseman Miguel Galaz (.404). 
</P>
<P>
Galaz, who played catcher last year, was moved to pitcher out of necessity 
after two of the team's projected starters were sidelined with injuries. He's 
come through with flying colors, posting a 5-0-1 record with a 1.87 ERA. His 
most impressive win came last week when he struck out eight and allowed only 
one run against a potent Miraleste lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Star (7-1) and Miraleste (8-1) are tied in the loss column and would 
finish as Santa Fe co-champions if they finish the regular season unbeaten, a 
distinct possibility in the unbalanced league. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Star's athletic teams have struggled with declining enrollment for several 
years, but Ponce De Leon said the situation is improving because of 
increasingly larger incoming classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a good crop of freshmen," he said. "There are 16 (freshmen) in the 
baseball program. People are starting to take notice of our school." 
</P>
<P>
Ponce De Leon expects to have another strong incoming group next fall, led by 
Gary Sloan, a catcher-third baseman who was one of the stars on the San Pedro 
Eastview team that reached the Little League World Series last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Few baseball teams, if any, could survive the loss of their top two pitchers. 
Bishop Montgomery Coach Bob Anderson knows that only too well. 
</P>
<P>
Touted by some as a contender for the Angelus League title, the Knights instead 
have struggled to a 2-15-2 overall record and a 1-8 league mark after losing 
their top two starters. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the season has been a bitter disappointment for Anderson, a 
fourth-year coach who had high expectations for Bishop Montgomery after the 
team took third place in the competitive Angelus League in 1989 and qualified 
for the playoffs from that league for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"If you told me (before the season) this is how things would turn out, I 
probably would have thought you were crazy," Anderson said. "But baseball is a 
funny game." 
</P>
<P>
Or, in Anderson's case, not so funny. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-handers Armando Cervantes and Walter Knutzen both went down with 
injuries early in the schedule. Cervantes, who was 7-1 and team MVP as a 
sophomore, is suffering from shoulder and elbow injuries that could jeopardize 
his prep career, Anderson said. Knutzen has tendinitis of the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the pitchers' injuries started, it just snowballed down the hill," 
Anderson said. "It wasn't the same team after the two kids got injured." 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes, expected to be the ace of the staff, was never the same after he 
developed a sore shoulder pitching in the off-season, Anderson said. He rested 
his arm for a month before the season, but it was too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes pitched in just two games for the Knights before the pain became 
unbearable. He struck out 12 in six innings against Riverside Poly and threw 
three innings of shutout ball in a league game March 24 against Servite. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing a player like that, it brought a lot of players down," Anderson said. 
"It's like the Dodgers and Orel Hershiser. He meant a lot to us." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said his only concern is for Cervantes to make a full recovery, 
regardless if he is able to pitch for Bishop Montgomery next season. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically our plan is to continue him on physical therapy and start him 
throwing in December or January, with doctor approval," the coach said. "We 
just have to take it one day at a time. We can't sit and panic and worry about 
what could be. He has a long career ahead of him. Even if he has to sit out 
next year and not play for us, that's what he has to do. I'm not going to 
jeopardize his career for my personal goals as a coach. I don't want him to 
pick up a baseball until he is ready to throw." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors have circulated that Anderson will be fired, but Bishop Montgomery 
Athletic Director Steve Carroll says that's all they are -- rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first I've heard of it," Carroll said. "Nothing like that has been 
said or commented on by the administration. I haven't sat down with the 
principal and Coach Anderson to even assess the pluses and minuses of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, though. Team records are nice, but there's a lot of other 
things that go into building a successful program." 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson: "If the administration decides to make a change for any reason 
they see fit, it's going to be their decision to make. Regardless if I'm at 
Bishop Montgomery or not, I'll be wearing a baseball uniform at some school. I 
have enough friends in the baseball community that I can hook on somewhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, El Segundo baseball Coach John Stevenson said of Eagle 
senior Mark Lewis: "If there's a better shortstop around, I haven't seen him." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson is still looking. 
</P>
<P>
Through 24 games, the consistent Lewis has committed only three errors, 
anchoring an infield that has been air-tight in virtually every inning. Third 
baseman Brett Newell and second baseman Eric Stevenson, the coach's son, have 
each committed only four errors in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the area of our team that I'm very, very happy about," Coach Stevenson 
said. "I'd put our infield, defensively, against anybody, anywhere. They can 
really play." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo committed only one error in two games Saturday. The Eagles beat 
Bosco Tech, 9-0, in a Camino Real League game and edged Millikan, 7-6, in the 
finals of the Palos Verdes/Redondo Tournament to improve to 20-3. 
</P>
<P>
The infield is on a pace to break the school record for double plays in a 
season. With 22, it is one behind the number of double plays turned by the 1971 
and '79 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Both of those clubs also featured outstanding shortstops -- George Brett in '71 
and Dave Combs, an All-CIF selection in '79. 
</P>
<P>
On most baseball teams, Brian Wise would be a productive member of the pitching 
staff. Playing for El Segundo, though, the promising left-hander is relegated 
to a supporting role as the team's No. 4 pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
But Wise has made the most of his limited opportunities. In 17 innings pitched, 
the junior is 2-0 with 24 strikeouts and an 0.45 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure on most teams in the South Bay he would be a star," Stevenson said. 
"But it's tough to get him innings with three established guys." 
</P>
<P>
Wise, who figures to be the Eagles' ace next season, plays behind seniors Rob 
Croxall (8-1), Tate Seefried (6-1) and Jason Wayt (5-1), the area's most 
balanced starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have the innings for (Wise) to throw," Stevenson said. "We get 
him in JV games when we can." 
</P>
<P>
Seefried hit two home runs Saturday to raise his total to 11, tying El 
Segundo's single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
Former Eagle catcher Jose Sanchez set the mark in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Seefried, who also leads the team in hits (42) and RBIs (39), is closing in on 
the South Bay and Southern Section season home run records held, respectively, 
by Tim Williams of St. Bernard (15 in 1987) and Arnold Garcia of Channel 
Islands (16 in 1981). 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro's softball and baseball teams played spoiler roles Tuesday, each 
posting upsets over Carson to knock the Colts out of undisputed first place in 
Southern-Pacific Conference races. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirate softball team routed previously unbeaten Carson, 11-1, at Scott Park 
in Carson, while the baseball team snapped the Colts' 12-game unbeaten streak 
with a 6-5 victory at Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Senior pitcher Lisa Gardea allowed one hit and retired 17 of the last 19 
batters to lead San Pedro to its biggest softball win of the season. Gardea 
assumed pitching duties midway through the season after senior Debbie Elgin was 
declared academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Noceti, Kathy Eldridge, Lusha Brown and Michelle Luce each had two hits 
for the Pirates (12-7 overall, 6-3 in league), who close out the season today 
at Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
Carson and Banning (each 8-1 in league) meet at 2:30 today at Dolphin Park in 
Carson to decide the championship. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro's baseball victory dropped Carson into a first-place tie with 
Banning. The Colts are 10-2-2 in conference play, while Banning is 11-3. The 
co-leaders meet twice next week. 
</P>
<P>
For the record: It was incorrectly reported last week that El Segundo's 
pitching staff has the lowest team ERA in the South Bay. As it turns out, 
Banning boasts the lowest mark with a 1.63 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Ace right-hander Mike Busby (8-3) has a 1.20 ERA in 76 innings pitched, while 
Mark Chavez (3-2) and Anthony Lozano (3-2) have ERAs of 1.13 and 2.94, 
respectively, in 31 innings each. 
</P>
<P>
Busby's most impressive statistic is a strikeout-to-walk ratio of nearly eight 
to one. The junior has 106 strikeouts and only 14 walks. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- The Ocean League softball showdown Monday between South Torrance 
and West Torrance (both 10-0) was rained out and rescheduled for Monday at 
South. The co-leaders meet at 3 p.m. Friday at West. . . . The Southern-Pacific 
Conference track finals will be contested at 2 p.m. today at Carson High. The 
Bay League finals are set for 3 p.m. Friday at Santa Monica, while the Ocean

LISA LESLIE SLAM DUNKS SAT ON 3RD TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Lisa Leslie, the third try at the Scholastic Aptitude Test proved to be the 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside High's highly recruited center learned last week that after two 
failed attempts she scored over 700 on the SAT, making her eligible to play 
collegiate basketball as a freshman next fall. 
</P>
<P>
But the 6-foot-5 Leslie, an honor student who carries a 3.5 grade-point 
average, was still unsatisfied with her 750 score. Echoing what others have 
charged, Leslie said the SAT is "biased" against minority students because it 
does not cover what they have learned in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"The test is basically biased, as far as I'm concerned," she said. "We should 
all learn the same things. It shouldn't differ as to what area you live in. In 
a way, it's like segregation. Not everyone is fortunate enough to live in Palos 
Verdes." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if her education at Morningside has failed to properly prepare her for 
college, Leslie said: "I know I'm not in the worst education situation, but I 
know it's not the highest either. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what's on the SAT, we haven't covered in our everyday learning. It 
might be because of our books. We have books that the school was using years 
ago. It's kind of unfair, because we're not all provided with the same 
materials." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie said she was "embarrassed" that it took her three tries to score 700, 
the NCAA cut-off point for freshman eligibility. She scored 680 on her first 
two attempts despite a strong academic background that includes being named 
winner of the Dial Award, given to the nation's top high school female 
scholar-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I can play my freshman year, but the 750 is not as good as my own 
standards," she said. "To me, it's kind of terrible. Hopefully I won't be too 
far behind in college." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie said she will take her final recruiting trip this weekend to Long Beach 
State. She is also considering USC and Notre Dame. The deadline for signing 
letters of intent is May 15. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Leslie is competing in track and field for Morningside. She 
qualified Tuesday for Friday's Ocean League finals in the high jump, long jump 
and triple jump. ROB FERNAS

AGUIRRE TWICE OUTRUNS PACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Obed Aguirre did not have to run as fast as he did Wednesday afternoon at the 
Northwest Valley Conference track and field finals, but San Fernando High Coach 
Ken Kohon wanted it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best workout," he said. "The races themselves are the best 
conditioners." 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre's workout in preparation for the City Section championships would have 
highlighted most runners' seasons. The San Fernando senior timed 4 minutes 19.3 
seconds and 9:29.3 in winning the 1,600- and 3,200-meter runs at Birmingham 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Kohon originally had also planned to enter Aguirre in the 800 against Kennedy's 
Warren Reich, the eventual winner in 2:00.2, but the Tiger coach balked. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to have him triple but that 800 is such a demanding race, and all 
the 800 would do is just zap his legs," Kohon said. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, the City cross-country champion last fall, led from wire to wire in 
both of his races. He won the 1,600 by more than 100 meters over Taft's Kipp 
Ortenburger, who finished second in 4:37.8. In the 3,200, Aguirre pushed an 
early pace and defeated sophomore Mike Krentzin (10:21.1) of Taft by almost a 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
Ontiwaun Carter of Kennedy won the 100 (10.9) and 200 (22.4). 
</P>
<P>
Other double winners included Chatsworth's Kyle Beck, San Fernando's Felicia 
Howard and Marquita Terry of Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Beck (15.1) easily outdistanced El Camino Real sophomore Jaffers Bailey (15.7) 
in the 110 high hurdles but had to outlean Canoga Park's Frank Harris in the 
300 intermediate hurdles to win in 39.8. Harris finished in 39.9. 
</P>
<P>
Howard triumphed in the 100 (12.4) and 200 (25.6) and Terry took the long jump 
and triple jump in 17 feet 2 1/2 inches and 33-0, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth senior Lori Mertes had a season-best 5-3 in the high jump to claim 
her third consecutive conference title but the effort is not close to her 
personal-best 5-10 1/2 set in last year's meet. 
</P>
<P>
Taft's Cornell Hill won the long jump at 23-9 and teammate Irving Carter 
bounded 45-9 to take the triple jump.

NOTRE DAME'S ORLANDO COLLECTS SIX HITS TO TIE SOUTHERN SECTION RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vinnie Orlando, a junior second baseman for Notre Dame High, tied a Southern 
Section record Wednesday with six hits as he led the visiting Knights to a 22-5 
rout of Harvard in a San Fernando Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando set the stage for his record performance with a single off first base. 
</P>
<P>
He added two singles and a pair of doubles and also hit a home run to 
left-center. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando, who bats right-handed, finished with four runs batted in and four 
runs. He entered the game batting .277 and now has 24 hits in 71 at-bats for a 
.338 average. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Southern Section players had collected six hits in one game entering this 
season. They include former Montclair Prep star Toi Cook, now a defensive back 
with the New Orleans Saints, and former Simi Valley standout Shaun Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Milligan, Steve Colella and Bruno Paniccia all had three hits for Notre 
Dame (14-10-1, 6-1), which battered three Harvard pitchers for 21 hits. Harvard 
is 6-12, 2-5.

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDALE'S MOORE HONORS LATE TEAMMATE WITH STIRRING RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale College athletes wore black armbands in last Friday's Western State 
Conference track and field championships in honor of their late teammate, Pablo 
Herrera, who died in an automobile accident three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
James Moore, a close friend of Herrera's, dedicated his 10,000-meter race in 
Herrera's memory. 
</P>
<P>
And then he delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Moore swept past Juan Romero of Bakersfield in the final 200 meters to win in 
31 minutes 36.0 seconds, almost a minute faster than his previous best. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to do our homework together and we used to stay in the same rooms when 
we traveled," Moore said of Herrera. "He was probably my closest friend on the 
team. (The 10,000) was his race and he should have been here. I wanted to win 
it for him." 
</P>
<P>
Moore also placed second in the 5,000-meter run. 
</P>
<P>
All track, no field: Glendale was dominant in the middle-distance races in the 
WSC championships, picking up 41 of its 148 points in the 800 and 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Provenzano won the 1,500 (3:59.20), one of four Glendale runners placing 
among the top seven. Nick Lugo (1:56.73) and Derrick Mitchell (1:56.93) placed 
first and second in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with the way we ran on the track, but Bakersfield was too strong 
in the field events," Glendale Coach Tom McMurray said. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield outscored Glendale, 114 1/2-19, in the field events to win its 
second consecutive WSC title. The Renegades scored 224 points. 
</P>
<P>
Doubly effective: With seven games left in the regular season, Craig Clayton of 
Cal State Northridge is one double shy of becoming only the fifth Matador 
player to have at least 80 hits and 20 doubles in a season. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore from Anaheim Loara High is batting .419 with 83 hits and 19 
doubles after Saturday's 7-6 victory over UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Rondal Rollin (105 hits and 22 doubles in 1980), Dave Govea (91 and 30 in '82), 
Jim Vatcher (87 and 20 in '87), and Lenn Gilmore (84 and 22 in '87) are members 
of Northridge's 80-20 club. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton already is the only CSUN player to bat better than .400 and lead 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. pitchers in victories. He has 11. 
</P>
<P>
Irish stew: The Western State Conference, despite canceling its Shaughnessy 
baseball tournament this spring after three teams tied for first place, will 
retain the current format for two more seasons, conference coaches decided at a 
meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Shaughnessy tournament has come under fire from some coaches who believe it 
occasionally keeps the conference's best teams out of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
However, the conference's lower-division teams like the idea of having a 
five-team postseason tournament. It gives the also-rans a goal and, indeed, 
nearly every team in the conference was in contention entering the final week 
of play. 
</P>
<P>
Aye for contact: A survey of Division II football coaches shows, predictably, 
that an overwhelming majority is opposed to the no-contact rule for Division II 
that was implemented this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches were opposed, 93-4, to the current guidelines, which limit spring 
drills to 12 practices of two hours in duration with no contact. They voted, 
91-6, in favor of adopting the Division I rule, which goes into effect next 
season and allows contact in 10 of the 15 practices. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Division II coaches' committee, was sent to all 
116 schools that played football at the Division II level last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Division II university presidents voted the no-contact rule into effect at the 
NCAA meetings in January as a cost-cutting measure. It was hoped that the cost 
of insurance premiums would be reduced because there would be less threat of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Among the coaches who responded to the survey, 72 predicted that more injuries 
would take place without contact because some players might ease up during 
drills while others were still going all out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not good legislation," said Bob Hiegert, athletic director at Cal State 
Northridge. "I know it wasn't in the best interest of our program." 
</P>
<P>
While many Division II teams will open the fall season against opponents who 
have practiced under similar restrictions, Northridge will play at Northern 
Arizona, a Division I-AA school from the Big Sky Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Rough return: This has been a disappointing season for the returning NCAA 
Division II All-Americans on Cal State Northridge's women's track and field 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Six of The Lady Matadors' seven All-Americans in 1989 were underclassmen, but 
only one (Lolita Pile in the long jump and triple jump) has automatically 
qualified for the Division II meet in Hampton, Va., May 24-26. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Arreola, two-time defending Division II 3,000-meter champion, is 
redshirting this season, but the rest of the Lady Matador returnees have failed 
to qualify for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Coleman, eighth in the 400 in 1989, has missed the season because of 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Gena Jauregui, sixth in the 1,500, has been unable to run because of 
thyroid-gland problems. 
</P>
<P>
Laural Isles (runner-up in the 100) and Lisa Gill (fourth in the heptathlon) 
have each been slowed by injuries, although Isles has qualified for nationals 
as a member of the 400-meter relay, and Gill has posted provisional qualifying 
marks in the heptathlon, high jump and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been one of those seasons," Coach Don Strametz said. "We've got a 
good 1,600 relay, but we would have been that much stronger with Mary."

WEST TORRANCE CAN'T SHAKE OFF JINX IN LOSING, 13-1, TO REDONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gods of baseball haven't been smiling on West Torrance High School lately, 
but that didn't stop West Coach Dick McGrath from mustering a grin after his 
team's latest mismatch with misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
Even after watching everything go wrong in West's 13-1 Ocean League loss to 
visiting Redondo on Wednesday, McGrath was looking hard for a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
"We're snake-bitten right now," McGrath said. "But we're still in the running 
for the playoffs. There's no dominant team in this league. I don't know what it 
will take for us to get into third place, but if someone loses three in a row 
or wins three in a row, it could still happen." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Redondo (13-11 overall, 7-4 in league) is in sole possession 
of third place. The fifth-place Warriors (8-13, 5-6) are two games out of a 
playoff spot, with games remaining against South Torrance, North Torrance and 
first-place Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
West's run of bad luck began a week ago, when McGrath's best player -- 
shortstop Dana Cowing -- shattered his jaw in a collision with a teammate while 
chasing a pop fly. 
</P>
<P>
And Cowing hasn't been the only Warrior casualty. West's starting third 
baseman, second baseman and catcher have also been injured, and the team's best 
pitcher is academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, West right fielder Rich Herrada sprained his ankle 
before Wednesday's game and couldn't play. Then Matt Mishler, the Warrior's 
starting left fielder, pulled his hamstring in the first inning and had to 
leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had too many injuries," McGrath said. "That's just too much to 
overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Still, McGrath had his best remaining pitcher, Jason Vroman, on the mound to 
start the Redondo game. Vroman took a 2.10 earned-run average into the game 
with him, but he wasn't immune to West's jinx either, and walked four of the 
first five batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors made a pair of errors behind Vroman (2-3) in the first inning, and 
by the time left-hander Gary Stewart replaced Vroman with two out in the 
second, West was down, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
West didn't help itself on the base paths, either, getting a runner gunned down 
at the plate in the second inning and another caught in a rundown between 
second and third bases in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"A lack of basic baseball hurt us today," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the field, Redondo played near-flawless ball in a game 
crucial to its playoff hopes. The Sea Hawks still must play league-leading Mira 
Costa and Culver City in their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got three big games left," Redondo Coach Tim Ammentorp said. "This was 
the game that really scared me because we basically had to win it." 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Artie Scarpino (5-4) threw a six-hitter and struck out seven, but 
lost his shutout bid on Randy Block's sacrifice fly in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff man Brett Tyrrell led Redondo with two hits and three runs batted in, 
and second baseman Chris Townsend singled twice and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa 5, North Torrance 3 -- Andy Owens collected two hits in three 
at-bats and drove in three runs to help the host Mustangs keep pace with Culver 
City for first place in the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa (12-11 overall, 9-2 in league) opened a 4-0 lead in the first inning 
and withstood a strong offensive performance by North (11-12, 4-6), which 
outhit the Mustangs, 12-9. But the Saxons could score only three runs off 
junior right-hander Jason Garner, who went the distance for his fourth league 
victory in six decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Owens put Mira Costa ahead with a two-run double in the first and added an RBI 
single in the fourth. D. J. Allen singled home a run in the first. Jason 
Boseant was two for four with two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Torino paced North, going two for three with two RBIs and a solo home run. 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance 6, Centennial 4 -- Stu Manthey's three-run homer in the third 
inning gave the Spartans a 5-0 lead, and right-hander Chris Castillon held off 
Centennial en route to an Ocean League win at South. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial cut its deficit to 5-3 in the fourth on a three-run homer, but South 
got a run back in the fifth on Aemon Fowler's pinch-hit RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
South improved to 7-12 overall and 4-7 in league play. Centennial had its 
league mark evened at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo 7, Verbum Dei 0 -- The Eagles, who pounded Verbum Dei, 31-1, in 
their first meeting March 28, were deadlocked in a scoreless tie before 
rallying for five runs in the fifth inning at Victoria Park in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very nervous," El Segundo Coach John Stevenson said. "Our game was just 
off. Everything seemed to go against us." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (21-3 overall, 10-1 in the Camino Real League) finally broke through 
in the fifth on RBI singles by Mark Lewis and Tate Seefried, an RBI double by 
Garret Quaintance, who scored on a passed ball, and a solo home run by Kenny 
Talanoa. Quaintance finished with three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Rob Croxall (8-1) gave up two hits in five innings and extended 
his scoreless-inning streak to 23. Junior left-hander Brian Wise finished up, 
allowing one hit. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard 7, Pius X 0 -- Senior right-hander Andy Diver, whose only loss this 
season was to top-ranked El Segundo, improved to 9-1 with a three-hitter in a 
Camino Real League game at Pius X in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Diver struck out three and walked none as St. Bernard (15-5 overall) kept pace 
with El Segundo for first place at 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Richardson was three for four with two RBIs, Sean Dunbar had three stolen 
bases and varsity newcomer Brian Benbow was two for three with two steals, 
including a steal of home in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings collected 10 hits, all singles.

A STAGING PLOY ENABLES THE IRVINE COMMUNITY THEATER PRODUCTION OF 'HOW THE

Alan Ayckbourn uses a simple but inspired theatrical device in "How the Other 
Half Loves": He allows two households to coexist simultaneously on the same 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
As they come and go in a comic weave, the similarities and differences in their 
morning routines and marital skirmishes are succinctly and humorously revealed. 
Before long, we learn that these opposite pairs, the upper-class Fosters (Frank 
and Fiona) and the lower-class Phillipses (Bob and Teresa), have more than a 
passing acquaintance: Frank is Bob's boss, and Bob has had a midnight fling 
with Fiona. 
</P>
<P>
Another couple enters the story as a result of the lies Bob and Fiona tell to 
conceal their indiscretion. William and Mary Detweiler become the hapless 
guests at separate but simultaneous dinner parties given by the Fosters and the 
Phillipses, and the ingenious interplay of these two social disasters confirms 
Ayckbourn's reputation as a concocter of mirth. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Community Theater's production is remarkably sleek and clean. The 
director, Beth Titus, keeps the story line clear and the pace at an even trot 
(though a gallop or two would have been nice, especially in the potentially 
hilarious dinners scene). 
</P>
<P>
As the Fosters, Tom Titus and Lorraine McWilliams play well together. Titus 
brings a charming bluster to Frank, although he swallows too many of his words. 
McWilliams has a natural elegance that suits Fiona and a theatrical flair that 
doesn't require as much mugging as she seems unable to resist. Brenda Pruitt 
and J. Brad Riker create a cardboard shrew and bully as Teresa and Bob, but 
they're big and broad and they keep it moving. 
</P>
<P>
Mousey Mary Detweiler is played by Lori Whitney with a sweetness untempered by 
self-doubt. And as William Detweiler, Michael O'Connor gives the most honestly 
comic performance, provoking a couple of very satisfying laughs. 
</P>
<P>

THE GARDEN GROVE COMMUNITY THEATER DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO WORK WITH IN THE TAME 
'HOW THE OTHER HALF LOVES.'

<P>
"How the Other Half Loves" is probably Alan Ayckbourn's most popular comedy; it 
seems to have found everlasting life on revival stages. 
</P>
<P>
But this flyweight number can't be called Ayckbourn's best work. The British 
playwright, who has been described as an urbane Neil Simon, can write 
pungently, as he did in "Intimate Exchanges." But "Other Half" is generally 
tepid business that lacks original terrain (subject: marital infidelities 
involving the boss's wife) and often pushes too hard in its attempt to find 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove Community Theatre production of "Other Half" doesn't do much 
with it -- but again, there's not much to work with. We get, in one of 
Ayckbourn's trademark manipulations of dramatic structure, three separate 
couples moving through their haphazard lives simultaneously. Everybody occupies 
much of the same space, with the action occasionally overlapping. To director 
Ray Williams' credit, the play does not become too confusing. If only it were 
funnier. 
</P>
<P>
Bob (Keith McCarthy), "office Romeo" and basic cad, is sleeping with Fiona 
(Diana Kolchier), whose husband, Frank (Mark Beaver), is a self-centered bore 
who ignores her. Fiona just wants to get some kicks. Soon after the play 
starts, things begin to unravel. Bob's wife, Teresa (Cleta Cohen), isn't 
brainy, but she has enough gray matter to know something's up. Frank, on the 
other hand, is dim to everything. In fact, he thinks twitchy Mary (Ilona 
Honeyman), who's married to meek William (Jeff Bickel), is doing nasties with 
Bob. 
</P>
<P>
The performances follow the customary path of domestic farce, with lots of 
energy, some face-making and comic gestures. None of the approaches really 
stand out in any way, although Beaver's handling of Frank is remarkable for its 
approximation of Monty Python's John Cleese in a pompous mood. The best job is 
done by Bickel, who lends William the twerpy self-conscious air of someone on 
the verge of evolving into a complete nincompoop.

"FUNNY FACE"(U.S.; Director: Stanley Donen; Cineplex Century Plaza 3, 8 p.m.). 
A restored print of the 1957 musical classic, a satire on fashion photography 
and Americans in Paris. The script is weak, but there are great songs by the 
Gershwin brothers, matchless hoofing by Fred Astaire, gamin smiles by Audrey 
Hepburn, photographs by Richard Avedon, deft, limber mise-en-scene by Stanley 
Donen. Through it all: the seemingly effortless elegance of the near-past, 
something we ought to try to recapture.

"ISLAND"(Australia; D: Paul Cox. Century Plaza 2, 7 p.m.) A beautifully shot

performance. Critic's Choice with the L. A. Weekly's Ella Taylor. (M. W.)

LOS LOBOS DIG INTO THEIR MUSICAL PAST FOR UCI FARM WORKERS' RALLY 
</P>

When Los Lobos showed up Tuesday to kick things off for Cesar Chavez at a UC 
Irvine rally -- making their first public appearance in nearly a year -- it 
wasn't the first time they had lined up with the United Farm Workers union 
founder. They had collaborated on "Si Se Puede!" ("It Can Be Done!"), an album 
of folk tunes recorded for the union back in 1976, long before they found fame 
as rockers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time since we've been able to do something for Cesar Chavez. 
We believe in him very much," Cesar Rosas, the bearded guitarist with the 
signature black sunglasses and slicked-back hair, told the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a reunion," drummer Louie Perez said later. "It rekindles 
the old flame and our solidarity with the farm workers." 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos played an all-acoustic set, using traditional Mexican stringed 
instruments more often seen in mariachi bands. David Hidalgo, who delighted the 
heavily Latino audience with his artistry on the requinto jarocho (similar to a 
tenor guitar), said afterward that pesticide spraying, over which the union 
launched its 4-year-old table grape boycott, is an issue that hits home for 
each of the band members. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have children, and the food that makes it to the table affects our 
lives," Hidalgo said. "Besides, there are a lot of families, a lot of people 
out there putting their lives on the line in the fields." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the musicians conceded that when a UCI student organizer first asked 
them to play at the rally, the thought struck fear in their hearts. Fresh from 
recording a new album -- "The Neighborhood," which Rosas described as "total 
rock" -- they hadn't rehearsed folkloric songs in a very long time. Rosas even 
warned the audience: "We figured if we got up and it sounded terrible, we could 
say, 'What the heck, we tried.' " 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos, whose new album is due for release July 10, will play the Greek 
Theatre in Los Angeles May 25 before opening a limited U.S. tour in Chicago 
July 4. An Orange County date may be added, band members said. Also in the 
works, Perez added, is a possible fall tour of Eastern Europe countries on a 
bill that may include Bob Dylan.

HANDICAPPED YOUTHS PLAY FOR LOVE OF GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lineup card had been filled out and the Greater Bellflower Falcons, young 
ballplayers in red and white uniforms, sat in the dugout before their 
long-awaited first Little League game. 
</P>
<P>
"Wish me luck, Mike, I'm terribly nervous," tall 16-year-old first baseman 
Aaron Taylor said to teammate Mike DeLine. 
</P>
<P>
"Good luck, Aaron, good luck," said Mike, 15. "Where's my Spalding mitt? My 
mitt?" 
</P>
<P>
Linked by a love for the game and the learning disorder aphasia, they went out 
to right field to warm up for the game with the West Lakewood Angels. Aaron 
used both hands to catch, Mike preferred one. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Blankenship," Mike said to Coach Jim Blankenship, "this is going to be an 
exciting game." 
</P>
<P>
In the dugout, catcher Ramon Munoz, who is 12 and has cerebral palsy, put on 
his mask, shin guards and chest protector -- and became hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Swift, 9, a dwarf, sat on the bench, his legs high off the ground, and 
held a fielder's glove in one hand and his red hat in the other. Ready to play, 
he said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
But Billy Vassar, who is hyperactive, had a lot to say as he looked out at the 
roadside diamond called Riverpark Stadium in Lakewood: "See that green fence? 
See the ball? Whack! Hopefully, there will be three on base so I can hit them 
all home." 
</P>
<P>
It was time on this late Saturday afternoon to play ball in Little League's new 
Challenger division, which enables youngsters ages 6 to 18 who have physical or 
mental disabilities to play organized baseball for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Challenger was a pilot program with five leagues nationally. Now 
there are 275. The Falcons, Angels and the Plaza A's of Long Beach form the 
Southeast/Long Beach area's league. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the fathers in the bleachers said he never thought he'd see his son 
play baseball," said Janet Smith, vice president of the West Lakewood Little 
League. 
</P>
<P>
The West Lakewood Angels, in white, took the field. Their first baseman was on 
crutches and the girl playing second patted her glove as she sat in a 
wheelchair. A "buddy" stood ready to push her chair. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron was up first. Hitting off a tee, he popped the ball to the pitcher's 
mound and reached first base with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Cheered by the crowd, Natalie Gosnell, 10, hit the ball next. Despite cerebral 
palsy, she ran hard, her pigtails flying beneath her batting helmet. Out at 
first, she returned to the dugout, where for a brief moment she was 
inconsolable. 
</P>
<P>
Mike then drove in Aaron with a single. 
</P>
<P>
"I made it all the way home," Aaron said. His butterflies had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Billy then proved he was not all talk. He belted a triple that reached the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
Little Eric, as he is called, stepped up. After the tee was lowered, he tapped 
the ball in front of the plate. He churned for first along a route that must 
have seemed a mile long. 
</P>
<P>
An Angel infielder fielded the ball and threw toward first base. Eric, urged on 
by fans who watched with wonderment, was in a tight race with the ball, which 
rolled and rolled . . . and then stopped in the grass. Eric kept going and was 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons went on to add several runs, although in this league no one keeps 
score. Finally, West Lakewood was up. 
</P>
<P>
"Batting for the Angels, Heather KIRBY!" announced a youngster over the 
public-address system. 
</P>
<P>
Heather, who is 13 and paralyzed by spina bifida, adjusted her batting helmet 
and, after several carefully measured practice swings that tantalized the fans, 
swatted the ball off the tee. Her buddy pushed her to first. She was out, but 
got an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Megan Pegueros, taking her turn, cocked her bat, but then spun around when the 
announcer misidentified her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not Heather, it's MEGAN," she said, looking up sternly at the booth. 
</P>
<P>
A chant of "Bry-an, Bry-an, Bry-an" went up from the grandstand when 
15-year-old Bryan Dilbeck, an aluminum crutch in his right hand and a bat in 
his left, stood at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the ball solidly, threw down his bat, grabbed his other crutch from a 
buddy and hobbled down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Mike, the second baseman, fielded the ball quickly. His throw to first was 
caught carefully by Aaron for an easy out. 
</P>
<P>
But Bryan, who has had cerebral palsy since birth, kept going. When he at last 
reached first base, he thrilled the crowd by planting a crutch hard on the bag, 
as if staking out a wonderful new territory -- which it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing baseball since I was 5 years old," Bryan said. 
</P>
<P>
But never like this, his grin verified, in a real Little League game. 
</P>
<P>
After several innings, it had become early evening and cloudy, but the game's 
specialness still shone through with brilliant clarity. 
</P>
<P>
This was Little League at its purest. There were no men browbeating children 
into tears over muffed plays. It was an atmosphere without tenseness, and in it 
the kids thrived. 
</P>
<P>
There were more thrills. Aaron got his third hit and pigtailed Natalie got her 
first. Little Eric belly-flopped into home plate and Heather rode across it. 
</P>
<P>
The buddies were as proud as the players. "I could get used to this," said Jeff 
Myers, 11. 
</P>
<P>
When the game was over, and no one had lost, the teams met by the pitching 
mound and touched palms. Then they walked across the dirt of the base paths, 
still fresh with Heather's tire tracks, to their waiting families. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Dilbeck's included his grandmother, Dee Zimmer, who often pitches to him 
in the back yard. The young first baseman was reluctant to leave, and Zimmer, 
who waited patiently with her folding chair, understood. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about heart . . . baseball can't get any better than this," said 
Larry Myers, a tanned, middle-aged man in a blue cap who had been a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
A coach in the regular Bellflower Little League and Jeff Myers' father, he 
added: "If the kids on my team showed half this determination, I'd be pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Although the hour was late, Myers still had on dark glasses. 
</P>
<P>
Behind them, he knew, his tears would not be seen.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: CUDAHY; 
</P>
<P>
JURY SETS $570,000 PRICE FOR CONDEMNED PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After four years of bickering over the value of a property that the Cudahy 
Redevelopment Agency condemned to build a Tiangus shopping center, a Los 
Angeles Superior Court jury last week settled the matter. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to real estate appraisers representing the Redevelopment Agency 
and the former property owners, Ted Burkett and his wife, Theresa Champagne, 
the jury decided that Burkett and Champagne should receive $570,000 for the 
one-third acre at Florence and Atlantic avenues, City Manager Jack Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett, who was left blind about seven years ago by diabetes, was asking 
$836,000 for the property, while his wife had asked for $696,000. When the 
Redevelopment Agency made its formal offer to buy out the Burketts in 1986, it 
offered $480,000, but later offered to settle out of court for $588,000, Joseph 
said. Burkett refused to accept the Redevelopment Agency's offer. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett sued the city when he heard that his property was going to be 
condemned, but a Superior Court judge ruled in the city's favor. Burkett, who 
is now living in Bellflower, said the forced relocation has caused him a great 
deal of hardship. He said he plans to appeal the judge's decision to allow the 
city to take his property for redevelopment.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL CUSTODIAL STAFF CUTS TO SAVE $1.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be fewer custodians to clean classrooms next fall as a result of a 
school board budget cut this week. 
</P>
<P>
The board Monday agreed to reduce its custodial staff by 10%, eliminating 37 
jobs through attrition as part of a package of cuts that will save the Long 
Beach Unified School District $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the board cut $8.7 million, mostly by eliminating 39 clerical and 
managerial positions through attrition and an early retirement incentive for 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts begin the budget process, which is expected to continue later this 
spring when the board reviews the 1990-91 budget, estimated at $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
Board members avoided more controversial suggested cuts, including a plan that 
would have scheduled students and teachers for 7:18 a.m. classes. Board members 
also dismissed the idea of eliminating a music program at the elementary 
schools or increasing the average classroom size by one student. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the board nixed a proposal to mandate physical education for 
11th-graders, which would have eliminated about 10 new teaching jobs. Staff 
members suggested the change because physical education classes can accommodate 
almost twice as many students as a regular class, thus eliminating the need for 
some elective courses.

COMPTON SCHOOLS PROJECT $7-MILLION SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COMPTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shortfall of $7 million to $9 million is projected for next year's school 
budget, meaning that more than 70 teachers, clerks, janitors and security 
officers could lose their jobs, school officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Music and art programs may suffer the most, with five of the district's 10 
music instructors listed for elimination in a budget report presented Monday 
night to the Compton Unified School District trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy recommendation to bring in," Acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez 
told the board. 
</P>
<P>
In direct instructional services alone -- not counting equipment and supply 
costs -- the cutbacks may total $2 million to balance the budget, according to 
the report. Other proposed cuts range from field trips to $4,500 worth of new 
classroom clocks to replace those that have stopped ticking. 
</P>
<P>
The report listed a total of $5.1 million in cuts, which means that additional 
cuts would have to be made if shortfall projections are correct. 
</P>
<P>
Use this as sub for grafs now set: 
</P>
<P>
The district's financial staff projected revenues next year of $118.3 million, 
but estimated that expenses would surpass revenues by $7 million to $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pay increases budgeted for teachers and other employees would add about $8 
million in expenses next year, the staff estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The exact amount of next year's shortfall depends in part on the amount of 
money the state sends to school districts. If the state money includes a 3% 
cost-of-living increase over the amount sent last year, Compton's budget 
shortage will be $9 million, said G. Stafford Offerman, the district's 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
PU at graf: If the cost-of-living ... 
</P>
<P>
If the cost-of-living increase is hiked to 4.95%, as indicated by some reports 
in Sacramento, Offerman said, the shortfall will be only $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Offerman and other district staff members stressed that their budget figures 
are only projections at this point, but the financial picture they presented 
for the 1990-91 school year is a disappointing one for teachers and other 
employees who have gone without raises all year. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers, who complain that they are among the lowest-paid educators in Los 
Angeles County, have been pressing for a comprehensive salary revision that 
would give pay hikes as high as 12% to the most experienced teachers. The 
district has been offering 6% increases. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said Monday night that they included 6% salary increases 
this year and next year for all employees in the new budget projections. This 
year's increase would be retroactive to the first of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the four unions that bargain for the teachers and other 
employees attended the marathon 5 1/2-hour budget session but said little. It 
was the first time the union leaders had a look at the budget projections. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees did not say what cuts they would support when it comes time to vote on 
the budget, but some voiced opposition to particular cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Mary Henry said she would not support cuts in art and music 
programs. "There must be an alternative somewhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A society perishes when the culture goes, and to assume that these children's 
education in the visual and performing arts is not as important as reading and 
writing is a travesty," Henry said. "We're missing a great wealth of talent in 
these kids and they're just going down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
Some trustees said they would support the suggestion to eliminate the 
district's public relations director and other staff members in that office, 
but others argued that the office works to promote a good image for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee John Steward said he would oppose proposed cuts in summer programs and 
in the district's Camp Comiche, a mountain camp to which the district sends 
children on outings. 
</P>
<P>
"You're either going to pay through the program or you're going to pay through 
vandalism (in the schools)," he said.

NATIONAL PET WEEK WILL BEGIN SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Happiness Is a Healthy Pet" is the theme of National Pet Week, which begins 
Sunday and is being sponsored by the Southern California Veterinary Medical 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
According to association president Dr. Ronald S. Porter, responsible pet 
ownership requires providing food, shelter, love and proper health care, as 
well as obeying leash and licensing laws, vaccinating dogs and cats, and 
cleaning up after pets to "ensure better pet / community relations." 
</P>
<P>
Porter said that National Pet Week is also working to increase public awareness 
of the psychological and physiological benefits of pet ownership.

Tracking Drug Money 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 127 to 283, the House defeated the stricter of two proposals for 
banks to keep records of international wire transfers that could involve drug 
money. The proposal was for a Treasury Department pilot program in which 
selected banks would have had to keep track of customers wiring large sums 
overseas. Left intact by the vote was the softer approach, supported by bank 
lobbyists, of letting Treasury draft regulations to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose during debate on a bill (HR 3848), later sent to the Senate, 
that empowered the government to close institutions convicted of laundering 
drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pilot program aimed at catching drug 
traffickers.

Jerusalem 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 378 to 34, the House approved a non-binding resolution (HR 290) 
recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and urging that it remain 
unpartitioned with Jews permitted access to its religious sites. The U. S. 
government does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and keeps the 
American Embassy in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dan Burton (R-Ind.) said the House "shouldn't be afraid to say" that 
Jerusalem is the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) said the resolution "will only polarize the 
situation" in the Middle East, slowing the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes want U. S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Budget Plan 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 106 to 305, the House rejected a blueprint for the government's 
$1.2-trillion fiscal 1991 budget. Popular among Republicans, the measure called 
for higher defense and lowersocial spending than the Democratic budget plan (HR 
310) that it sought to replace. But it was less generous to defense than 
President Bush's budget. Its main feature was to freeze defense and domestic 
spending other than for entitlement programs at 1990 levels. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House worked toward approval of a 1991 congressional 
budget resolution that will guide later action on individual spending bills and 
serve as a bargaining tool in talks with the White House to set fiscal 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the GOP-backed budget plan.

An error by ground controllers triggered an emergency closure of the Hubble 
Space Telescope's aperture door and sent the observatory into hibernation for 
nearly 12 hours, NASA officials said. But project officials at the NASA Goddard 
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., reported that the $1.5-billion telescope 
was brought back to normal "quickly and effectively," in part because of the 
practice the controllers received during the telescope's problem-plagued first 
week in orbit.

Mourners of three teen-agers who killed themselves were told at the first

going with him was "still our choice." Thomas Smith, 17, was the first of three 
suicides among students at Sheridan High School in two days, and counselors for 
their classmates were on 24-hour call. About 250 people packed into a chapel to 
hear the Rev. Dennis Moon urge them to cling to God as they grieved over 
Smith's death.

4-cents-a-gallon gas tax increase was unacceptable. Martinez favors allowing 
local governments to make the tax decision, and he said the Legislature's bill 
allowed the people no voice in imposing the levy.

ANAHEIM WANTS TO 'WIPE OUT GRAFFITI' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim's Planning Department and Code Enforcement Division is sponsoring a 
"Wipe Out Graffiti" campaign on three consecutive Saturdays, May 5, 12 and 19, 
in its continuing effort to eliminate unwanted inscriptions on public surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
The city needs volunteers who are at least 12 years of age to paint over 
graffiti or plant shrubs and vines in front of slogan-prone walls. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers ages 12 to 15 will have adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"In years past we've had paint-outs, but we've never had (a campaign) this big 
before," says Carolyn Griebe, consultant to the city. "We sent out about 200 
letters to every service group, church service group and high school throughout 
the city of Anaheim. The volunteers and volunteer groups want to help because 
they are fed up with this problem and want to express neighborhood pride." 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti has increased in recent years, as has the cost of removing it. 
</P>
<P>
By law, it is the property owner's responsibility to remove graffiti, but for 
some it's an overwhelming problem. "Some of the citizens are elderly or 
disabled," said Griebe. "For instance, we had a citizen who is blind and didn't 
even know his home was an eyesore. A group of volunteers went out and painted 
his house." 
</P>
<P>
The city is currently offering a $500 reward to anyone who can provide 
information that leads to the arrest of a graffiti offender. "We have given out 
six rewards so far," says Griebe. "There have been more than 20 arrests this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Code Enforcement Division at (714) 999-5158. 
Volunteers are asked to brings their own brush or roller. The city will provide 
the paint, shrubs and vines.

FAMILY LIFE: PARENTS ANONYMOUS HAS ENDURED 20 YEARS DESPITE PERCEPTION PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents Anonymous marks its 20th anniversary this year struggling with what 
could only be called an identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the statistics, there has never been a greater need for the services 
of the organization, yet its membership is extremely low, especially in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The problem certainly hasn't been caused by any dramatic change in focus during 
its two-decade existence: the goals are exactly as they were at the time of 
PA's founding -- to help abusive parents change their ways. 
</P>
<P>
Counting just those cases of child abuse that are reported to officials, there 
are a minimum of 50,000 Orange County parents not only eligible for membership, 
but in need of PA's help. 
</P>
<P>
Current membership, however, is only about a dozen, according to Shirley Lui, 
executive director of PA of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, she admits, could be in the organization's name, which to 
most people implies some kind of connection with such loosely knit 12-step 
groups as Alcoholics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous and Overeaters Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
PA is not loosely structured at all, she says, and is not a 12-step program. 
Every meeting in any of the group's 1,200 chapters nationally is directed by a 
mental health professional. Lui, for example, is a licensed clinical social 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
That fact creates membership problems, too, says Margaret Ready, the Los 
Angeles-based executive director of PA of California. Under state law, a 
professional must report any suspected child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We announce that right up front to anyone who attends a meeting," she says. 
"If a member tells us they are abusing their child, we must report it. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage them to report it themselves, and many times they will. The first 
big step is recognizing their problem and the fact that they have come to us 
shows they have done that and are receptive to making changes in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
The denial comes especially, she says, from those members who are referred by 
the courts (and about half of PA's national membership comes from the court). 
"We've had people who are in total denial for months and months, who don't see 
their treatment of their children as abuse," she says. "Most times, of course, 
they were abused as children themselves and have spent a lifetime refusing to 
face it." 
</P>
<P>
Denial, says Lui, is the most common defense mechanism of new members. The flip 
side is to accept the public disgrace and the shame that comes with being 
branded a child abuser. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a scary thing to walk in and talk about something you're so terribly 
ashamed of," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"When people come to us, especially if sent by the courts, many times they have 
already had their children taken away from them. Or they are afraid they are 
about to lose the children." 
</P>
<P>
PA's job is to help the member face the facts as they are, to deal with them 
and to change how they deal with their children. 
</P>
<P>
"While we're not a parenting class by any means," says Lui, "we do spend a lot 
of time talking about parenting issues. 
</P>
<P>
"And one of the first things each member must do is to make a commitment to 
nonviolence." 
</P>
<P>
The role of the professional in the groups is to get such commitments and to 
"keep them focused on the important issues," she says, "especially those they 
would like to avoid, like the abuse of themselves as children. 
</P>
<P>
"And many times it takes quite a while before they develop enough insight so 
that they can see what their lives were really like as children. 
</P>
<P>
"So, often the first task is to help them work through the pain of their own 
abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Parents Anonymous, both Lui and Ready are quick to point out, is not just for 
parents who abuse their children. "It's for anyone who loses their cool with 
their kids," says Lui, "who lose control, even if it's only verbally. 
</P>
<P>
"We provide a safe place to come and talk about those problems and, with the 
help of people just like yourselves, work on solutions." 
</P>
<P>
While Lui is hoping to start chapters in both North and South County, currently 
the only PA meetings available in the county are in Santa Ana at the Holy 
Family Service Center, 1403 S. Main St., Santa Ana, on Tuesday evenings at 
6:30. 
</P>
<P>
Lui can be reached at (714) 835-5551. There is also a toll-free number -- (800) 
352-0386 -- with 24-hour service. All PA services are free.

FOR PARENTS: WHAT A DIFFERENCE 10 SIMPLE WORDS CAN MAKE

<P>
Quite simply, 10 words. 
</P>
<P>
"There's someone in the kitchen I want you to meet." 
</P>
<P>
Idealistic, impulsive female, undeclared major, sociology minor, meets 
unpretentious, pragmatic male zoology major, music minor, one February night at 
a party in a crowded apartment in Ann Arbor, Mich. Thus begins the saga of a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Like most young married student couples, we passed many years in student 
housing projects, libraries and laundry rooms. Finally, declaring a major and 
graduating, I spent a fifth year in school getting a teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
I was fortunate to have a wise principal as my mentor who gave only two 
directives before my first day as a junior high school English and history 
teacher: "Be fair and listen carefully." It was never clear who grew more in my 
classroom -- the teacher or the students. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, at a party they gave me before the birth of our first child, one 
of my students queried, "What kind of baby do you want?" I scanned the faces of 
these young people whom I knew so well through classroom discussions of 
literature and history and also through their personal journals, which they 
shared with me. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope our child will be the kind of child who has friends -- friends to sit 
with at lunch when they are in junior high," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
There appeared to be no clear outline at the onset of our parenting. In 
actuality, we missed the final Lamaze class when our first child arrived one 
month early. I attribute all inabilities to cope with our children's behavior 
patterns to material we may have missed at that class. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, we have made perpetual junkets to the grocery store, kept the washer 
and dryer in working order, adjusted to living with some clutter, dust, and an 
unmanageable garage, insisted that car seats and seat belts be worn at all 
times, and taken our children everywhere. When our last child graduates from 
high school in 2001, we will have spent 29 years involved in play groups, 
schools, sports teams, pajama parties and musical groups. Additionally, we will 
have made endless expeditions to libraries, museums, beaches, mountains, parks, 
bowling alleys and concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, a young senior approached me to critique the rough draft of his 
college essay. The question, "Who are your heroes?" was answered by referring 
to a well-known scientist, a national leader, and a writer. Eighteen years ago, 
before my education as a parent commenced, my answer might have been quite 
similar to his. Today, in my efforts to be an involved parent, I have rephrased 
my definition of hero. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I am impressed with a single-parent father who coaches our 10-year-old 
daughter's softball team. An attorney by training, he posseses a natural 
ability to teach, motivate, and delight 9-, 10- and 11-year old girls. 
</P>
<P>
I am in awe of a friend who, in addition to her own 18-year-old daughter and 
16-year-old son, has opened her home to two other 16-year-old boys who needed a 
change of home and neighborhood environment. She laughs when I call her a saint 
and notes that her greatest challenge is keeping the refrigerator stocked. As 
for meals, she has found that placing a half-gallon carton of milk in front of 
each boy at dinner seems to meet their liquid-intake needs. 
</P>
<P>
I am in competition for good lunches with the father of a dual-working family. 
"Oh, Mom" says my 7-year-old son, "you should have seen what Derek and Taylor's 
dad packed them for lunch today." 
</P>
<P>
I laud a family that managed to function throughout two years of counseling and 
rehabilitation programs with a teen-ager involved in drugs and alcohol. Today, 
he is a model student and community worker. 
</P>
<P>
I credit a group of pediatric physicians in North County who recognized that 
breast-feeding is not the most natural act of mothering and have included a 
registered nurse to counsel and assist patients both in the office and at home. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud the growing list of educators who recognize that not every child has 
the same learning patterns and are now addressing learning disabilities. 
Finding answers in this educational maze can be a tremendous task. 
</P>
<P>
My list of heroes continues to flourish as I log miles on our family vehicle. 
Some of the best times spent with our children have been the spur-of-the-moment 
"field trip," such as an essential trip to In-N-Out Burgers, a walk on the 
beach at 5 on a Sunday afternoon, a trip to the landfill (we call it the dump) 
with a carload of tree cuttings and 10-year-old boys, a Friday night high 
school football game, and riding in the express lane on Interstate 15 and 
watching other single-motorist vehicles inch by. 
</P>
<P>
More organized and lengthy journeys, such as our recent spring-break trip to 
Northern California to explore California history and show Berkeley to our 
18-year-old daughter who will be attending the school this fall, tend to test a 
family's strength. I cite one moment on Friday afternoon in rush-hour traffic 
on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, after six days of traveling with a 
7-year-old with chickenpox, as an example. 
</P>
<P>
I am still a neophyte at day-to-day parenting. At moments when I am 
overwhelmed, I am reminded that my role model, my mother, raised seven children 
as a single parent on a limited budget. There is always so much more to learn. 
</P>
<P>
My 16-year-old son shakes his head in disgust that I still confuse his football 
position as defensive rather than offensive. I need to learn to live with some 
small failures. Not all of the birthday parties at our home are successful and 
peaceful. I cannot fully understand my children at all times. I found the Guns 
N' Roses group at the Rolling Stones concert in Los Angeles perplexing, but 
loved Mick Jagger. I do not judge roller-blades at $150 a necessity. I am, 
however, open to discussion at all times. 
</P>
<P>
After all, 10 words made a difference in my life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EDITOR'S NOTE 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Brown, a teacher by training, recently returned to the classroom as a 
substitute. But, with four children, motherhood has been her vocation. Her 
oldest child enters UC Berkeley this fall; the youngest is in first grade. Yes, 
she says, they all have the same father. Brown's column, For Parents, will 
combine the humor and humility of 18 years of parenting with down-to-earth 
ideas on what parents can do for and with their children in North County. It 
will appear on the first Thursday of the month.

MAYOR'S VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a recent article ("North's Attitude Divides by Longitude, Not Latitude," 
April 1), I was quoted out of context, which proved misleading to the readers. 
The purpose of this letter is to set the record straight on my views regarding 
the character, life style and opportunities of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Escondido have traditionally played a major role in molding the 
economic, cultural and academic standards and priorities of our community. In 
1985, the citizens voted to build a $52-million cultural center, including a 
state-of-the-art, 1,500-seat lyric theater and fine arts museum to open in 
1993. They also agreed to spend up to $12 million on revitalizing downtown. 
When it was determined that a suitable land site for a state college campus was 
not available in Escondido, the city supported the establishment of a state 
college in neighboring San Marcos. Further, Escondido is a role model for other 
cities in providing housing for the working poor, single parents and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
These enterprises are but a few of Escondido's laudable accomplishments. We are 
proud of our city and its people, and we welcome others to join us in the 
celebration of our cultural and academic achievements.

CANDIDATE OPPOSES TENT JAIL PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
State attorney general candidate Arlo Smith on Wednesday said he disapproves of 
a proposal to punish minor drug offenders in Ventura County by jailing them in 
tents. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to put first-time users in a tent city," said Smith, San 
Francisco's district attorney. "We need better and more meaningful treatment 
programs that will change their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ventura County Sheriff John V. Gillespie and Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury proposed jailing recreational drug users in tents on a military base 
as part of an overall plan to crack down on the demand for illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, inmates would be assigned to work on the base or to other 
cleanup projects, plus mandatory substance-abuse classes. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he favors drug education and counseling, but he questions 
incarcerating those accused of possessing or using drugs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over how to curb drug abuse has spilled into the Democratic primary 
campaign for attorney general between Smith and his opponent, Los Angeles Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said he wants to eliminate the state program to divert first-time 
offenders to drug-abuse classes rather than sending them to jail. It is 
imperative, Reiner said, to issue stiff penalties for first-time offenders if 
America is going to win the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not lose this war overnight and we won't win it overnight either," 
Smith said. "Reiner said that only 20% in these treatment programs get 
something out of it, so it isn't worthwhile. My view is if we can save 20%, 
that is better than losing all of them by putting them in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Smith made his comments on a campaign swing through Ventura County Wednesday. 
His schedule included a speech at Ventura College and a reception sponsored by 
Democrats United, a local political action group, to raise money to build a 
county Democratic headquarters. KENNETH R. WEISS

SOUTHERN COMFORTS: THE SUPERIORITY OF A GOOD COUNTRY BREAKFAST; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITIONS: IN EVERY CORNER OF THE SOUTH AND IN EVERY SEASON OF THE YEAR, THE 
FIRST MEAL OF THE DAY IS RARELY TAKEN LIGHTLY. SOME REMEMBRANCES FROM NATIVE 
SONS AND DAUGHTERS.

1987).

"In the morning they rose in a house pungent with breakfast cookery, and they 
sat at a smoking table loaded with brains and eggs, ham, hot biscuits, fried 
apples seething in their gummed syrups, honey, golden butter, fried steaks, 
scalding coffee. Or there were stacked buttercakes, rum-colored molasses, 
fragrant brown sausages, a bowl of wet cherries, plums, fat, juicy bacon, jam." 
</P>
<P>
 -- THOMAS WOLFE, "LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL" 
</P>
<P>
It was his own waking to the seductive aromas of breakfast in his mother's 
Asheville, N.C., boarding house that author Thomas Wolfe remembered so vividly. 
Wolfe was not the first Southern writer to wax eloquent over a breakfast 
spread, nor has he been the last. Since the days of plantations, breakfast has 
been a major meal in the South -- for some, it is the major meal -- and in 
almost every state from Virginia to Louisiana there remain many old and 
established traditions surrounding the bountiful morning repast. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many Americans get their morning start-ups from a cereal box or the 
drive-up window of a fast-foot outlet -- if, indeed, they take the time to eat 
at all. But on special occasions, whenever time permits, millions of people 
linger nostalgically over breakfast the way it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
For Southerners especially, the fondness for a substantial morning meal 
endures. A hearty Southern breakfast in the traditional style has more than 
enough diversity to draw an appreciative crowd to a boarding house or a banquet 
table. It's a meal that is sometimes formal and sometimes casual; it knows no 
bounds of class, race or calling. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee writer Wilma Dykeman in her 1966 novel, "The Farm Family," has Papa 
explain the natural superiority of a good country breakfast to his children at 
the table. "No Astor or Vanderbilt has better eating than this," he tells them. 
"You young'uns just remember, the richest man living on Park Avenue in New York 
City can't eat what we've got set before us right here this morning. His corn's 
stale, his eggs have been shipped in from some place, his milk's all treated 
some way -- I tell you, we're lucky folks!" 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that most of the items on that once-standard menu -- bacon and 
sausage, eggs and butter, milk and cream, coffee, hot breads, sweet syrups -- 
are now deemed poor choices from the standpoint of health and nutrition. To 
enjoy judicious servings of them once in a while seems a pleasure too innocent 
to abandon. That pleasure is what keeps the traditional breakfast close to so 
many hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast traditions have different origins in different regions of the South. 
For example, the fabled Virginia hunt breakfasts that date back to the Colonial 
era are restaged from time to time. Exceedingly popular Kentucky Derby brunches 
are an outgrowth of the plantation banquets of old. In the South Carolina low 
country around Charleston, morning feasts authentic in their fidelity to early 
times can be found in cookbooks and even sampled in small cafes. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish influences along the Gulf Coast from Tampa, Fla., to Mobile, Ala., 
still season the time-honored breakfast dishes of the subtropical terrain. 
Nothing can top the richness and elegance of Creole cuisine in the forenoon 
feasts that grace the brunch tables of New Orleans. Inland and upland across 
the South, people of all classes still answer the call to country breakfasts 
that easily make up in quantity and quality anything they may lack in the way 
of elegance or formality. 
</P>
<P>
As much as these delicious meals vary from one region to another, they are all 
closely bound by the culinary traditions of the South. In every corner of the 
region and in every season of the year, Southerners seem irresistibly drawn to 
morning cookery. 
</P>
<P>
It was Madame Elizabeth Begue of New Orleans who probably invented brunch. From 
1863 until her death in 1906 she offered a sumptuous second breakfast in her 
coffeehouse near the French Quarter marketplace. Among the dishes on her menu 
were many Creole specialties that now are considered dinner items -- crawfish 
bisque, for example, and jambalaya -- but some of her simplest creations still 
rank among favorites for New Orleans breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
Madame Begue was a genius at using leftovers to make new dishes. In her 
skillful hands, yesterday's potatoes and tomatoes found new life in today's 
omelets, and she turned stale bread into pain perdu -- what we now call French 
toast. Many of her recipes, published in the 1930s, have found their way into 
other cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of the German-born Madame Begue's second breakfast is another 
French Quarter tradition known as Breakfast at Brennan's. Begun more than 40 
years ago at a restaurant owned by Irishman Owen Brennan and his family, the 
now-famous feast continues there under the direction of Brennan's sons. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 800 miles upriver in Louisville, Kentuckians delight in their 
elegant breakfasts on the day of the Kentucky Derby. Throughout the morning 
prior to the running of the annual race, they work their way through icy mint 
juleps, country ham, biscuits and gravy, grits and eggs, and other delicacies. 
Like the hunt breakfast that preceded it, the Derby breakfast recalls the 
lavish plantation hospitality of an earlier time. 
</P>
<P>
Not all great Southern breakfasts are such elegant affairs. Consider, for 
example, a straightforward combination of country sausage, gravy, fried eggs, 
biscuits, fried apples and coffee. Their preparation is simple and the result 
is an abiding pleasure for all who eat -- a table full of guests, a small 
circle of family and friends or the cook, dining in peaceful solitude. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Farm Family," Wilma Dykeman said it best. She wrote that by the time 
Papa had finished his song of praise for his family's farm-fresh Southern 
breakfast, "Ivy and the other children were sorry for millionaires who had only 
money and could not enjoy the fruits of the earth at the peak of their season." 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes were adapted from ones in "Mme. Begue's Recipes of Old 
New Orleans Creole Cookery," (J. S. W. Harmanson, 1937); "Southern Food" by 
John Egerton (Knopf, 1987), and from specialties at Brennan's restaurant in New 
Orleans.

NOW SHOWING: THE ARTIST AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara Chase-Riboud apologizes about the tedious pace of constructing one of 
her sculptures. No theatrical flourishes here, flinging gobs of clay or chunks 
of metal onto a pedestal. Creating a Chase-Riboud is a slow, incremental 
process, something like building a nest. 
</P>
<P>
"Little by little, you begin to have something that looks like a sculpture, I 
hope," she says. 
</P>
<P>
This is in a paint-spattered studio at Pasadena City College, where 
Chase-Riboud was serving last week as the art department's fourth annual Artist 
in Residence. The sculptor spent much of her residency cutting strips of wax, 
shaping them into whorls and painstakingly fitting them onto a board, the sum 
of which would ultimately be cast in bronze. 
</P>
<P>
On the busy Pasadena campus, the yearly Artist in Residence program has become 
the art world equivalent of a "star turn" -- like Katharine Hepburn performing 
a cameo role in an ensemble production or Pavarotti stepping out of the 
audience to sing a brief aria. 
</P>
<P>
A famous artist lectures on art, exhibits works in the College Art Gallery, 
socializes on the wine-and-cheese circuit and, in the allotted week, creates a 
new work of art -- all within the confines of a bustling suburban campus. 
</P>
<P>
For Chase-Riboud, it was exhilarating. "I'm having a great time," said the 
Philadelphia-born sculptor, an exotic-looking woman with jutting cheekbones and 
hair cascading down her back. 
</P>
<P>
Students and faculty clustered around her in the studio, circling her 
work-in-progress like tourists at a bazaar and lobbing questions at her. Does 
she have set hours to work? "No set hours," she said, continuing unflappably to 
shape her strips of wax. Does she try to express some kind of a philosophy of 
art? "Not while I'm working." 
</P>
<P>
Who's her audience? 
</P>
<P>
"Some consider my work more European than American," she said. "But the 
Europeans consider it quite American." 
</P>
<P>
Chase-Riboud, 50, is not only a widely admired artist whose monumental 
constructions of bronze shards, woven silk and hammered aluminum are in the 
permanent collections of, among others, the Museum of Modern Art and the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; she is also a respected historical 
novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Her books include "Sally Hemings," the story of Thomas Jefferson's mulatto 
lover, which won the Kafka Award for the best novel written by an American 
woman in 1979 and sent waves of controversy through some staid academic 
circles. Her most recent book was last year's "Echo of Lions," the story of a 
shipboard slave rebellion, also based on historical fact. She has also written 
poetry, winning the Carl Sandburg Poetry Prize in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Students were particularly curious about the connections between her writing 
and her art. 
</P>
<P>
The writing was an unexpected development, Chase-Riboud confesses. She sort of 
backed into it. "I never took a course in any kind of literature," she says. 
"I'm the worst speller in the world. It was really sheer chutzpah." 
</P>
<P>
But she found the tale of the Founding Father and the slave woman, first 
revealed in Fawn Brodie's biography of Jefferson, so compelling that she was 
drawn inexorably into writing a book. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the most fantastic American love stories," she says. "I tried to 
convince numerous writer friends to do it. Finally, (novelist) Toni Morrison 
told me, 'Instead of going around asking other people to write the novel, why 
don't you just do it yourself?' " 
</P>
<P>
The novel allowed her to explore her own theories about arbitrary racial 
distinctions in America, which she once described as a "mulatto country." 
</P>
<P>
And it introduced her to a new, more demanding medium, she says. "There's 
something terribly healthy about sculpture," she says. "It's very fundamental. 
You build something. You look at it. It's finished. But a book is never 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
With books, there are publicity tours, translations, continuing controversies, 
movie rights (both "Sally Hemings" and "Echo of Lions" have been optioned by 
Motown Productions). "You never even really sell a book," Chase-Riboud says. 
"You just give someone else the right to print what you've written." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed inevitable back in Philadelphia that Chase-Riboud would land 
somewhere in the arts. With dance classes when she was 5, piano lessons at 6 
and art lessons at 7, she describes herself as a prime "art brat." 
</P>
<P>
Her father was a frustrated architect, her mother a medical technician. 
Chase-Riboud won scholarships to the Tyler Art School at Temple University and 
the Yale School of Art and Architecture, where she earned a master's in fine 
arts in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
She always yearned to travel, to escape the pedestrian precincts of her 
hometown. "Maybe it was Philadelphia," she says. "I remember as a little girl 
looking out the window, saying, 'If I could only get out of Philadelphia.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her first travel adventure came as a John Hay Whitney Foundation fellow in 
Rome. Some friends dared her to accompany them on a trip to Egypt, then they 
abandoned her on the waterfront in Alexandria. "It was a matter of: Do I turn 
back now or go on?" 
</P>
<P>
She elected to go on, staying for three months with an American diplomat and 
his family in Cairo and visiting all of the Egyptian monuments. It was a 
historic experience, she says, giving her new confidence as an Afro-American 
artist and introducing lasting elements into her sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"The power, the elegance and sophistication of Egyptian art, the monumentality 
of it -- after that, Greek and Roman art looked like pastry," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Chase-Riboud moved permanently to Europe in 1960, marrying French 
photographer-journalist Marc Riboud in 1961. They were married for 20 years and 
had two sons before they divorced. For the last nine years, she has been 
married to Italian art dealer Sergio Tosi. 
</P>
<P>
She splits her time between Paris and Rome, where her studio in the Palazzo 
Ricci is reputedly the same one used by 16th-Century goldsmith Benvenuto 
Cellini. 
</P>
<P>
And she continues her traveling ways. "I'll go anywhere, with any excuse 
whatsoever," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, she was one of the first American women to travel in the People's 
Republic of China, and she has traveled extensively in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her literary accomplishments, Chase-Riboud takes pains to keep 
"literary" elements out of her art. Her sculpture pieces are abstractions, she 
insists, offering viewers a kind of Rorschach test of their own points of view. 
One viewer last week, apparently unable to get over the artist's blackness, 
interpreted all of her works as depictions of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it was all that black material," Chase-Riboud recounted. " 'This is 
definitely slavery,' he said. 'It's definitely in the air.' He went home with a 
very peculiar impression of the show." 
</P>
<P>
She worries that America is fading as a great art center. While American 
artists are moving in large numbers to Europe, she says, the United States art 
scene is becoming a "supermarket for the rich," with investors trading in art 
as a commodity. 
</P>
<P>
In her sculptures, Chase-Riboud uses a propane torch, a hot plate and some 
carving tools, including a kitchen knife. She slices the wax with a hot knife 
or melts the edges with the torch. "We're working extremely spontaneously," she 
says, "extremely freely." 
</P>
<P>
A student persists in asking her about her philosophy of art. "It's hard to 
verbalize," she says. "If artists could verbalize, they'd write." She pauses 
for a moment, apparently remembering that she is indeed a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, it's the beauty of the object," she says. "The poetry 
and the mystery."

CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the request of the City Council, City Administrator Robert Clute will remain 
in his post for one more year, reversing his decision to retire because of 
dissension about him on the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided in a three-hour, closed-door session Tuesday night to ask 
Clute to stay, according to Mayor James Castaneda. 
</P>
<P>
The decision also ends a search for a new city administrator. This had begun in 
January when Clute, 65, said he was leaving after 16 years in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda and Clute acknowledged that the change in the council's and the city 
administrator's thinking occurred as a result of the April elections. Former 
Councilman Ted R. Anderson lost in his bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, political newcomer Dominic S. Polimeni, who received the most 
votes in the council race, had questioned the council's acceptance of Clute's 
retirement.

STUDY OF BILLBOARDS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has rejected a recommendation that the city conduct a full 
environmental impact study as part of its proposal to ease billboard 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, council members this week decided that a full study is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
They ordered staff members instead to come up with a less rigorous 
environmental checklist to assess the impact of more billboards in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Tarvin, acting development director, had urged the city to explore the 
environmental impact because new signs could obstruct views and potentially 
"degrade the quality of the environment." But Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant 
said the proposed liberalization of billboard regulations would apply mainly to 
manufacturing areas and "most of the factories that have been built are not 
works of art anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering an ordinance that would allow up to 15 new billboards 
to be constructed along freeways and allow existing signs to be relocated in 
manufacturing zones.

CITY TO SPONSOR CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Monrovia Aquatics Club will remain a city-sponsored program, at least for 
another 18 months, the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Services Department had recommended that the 45-member club 
become independent, but a large turnout of supporters at City Hall Tuesday 
persuaded the council to continue subsidizing the club's activities for now, 
Councilwoman Mary Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
After 18 months, the city will evaluate whether the club should become 
independent, City Manager Jim Starbird said. Until then, the city will help pay 
for coaches and insurance, he said. Starbird said the city spends $2,500 or 
less each year to support the club's programs.

SUSPECTED GANG MEMBER CONVICTED IN CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected Baldwin Park gang member was convicted of second-degree murder this 
week for causing an auto accident in which his passenger, a fellow gang member, 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
A Pomona Superior Court jury deliberated about four hours before finding 
21-year-old George Delatorre guilty on Monday of second-degree murder in 
connection with the Nov. 5 crash, which left 18-year-old Conrad Franco dead. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they do not believe that Delatorre intended to harm Franco, 
who they contend was leaning out the passenger window firing a .38-caliber 
revolver at a carload of rival gang members ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors argued that Delatorre, who ran a red light and slammed his dark 
gray Monte Carlo into a pickup truck, knowingly created the circumstances that 
led to Franco's death. 
</P>
<P>
"He was fully aware and conscious of the dangers to human life," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Dennis E. Ferris. "That makes it murder." 
</P>
<P>
Testifying on his own behalf at last week's trial, Delatorre denied that he was 
driving the car. A third man, whose name he did not know, was behind the wheel, 
Delatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
Delatorre, who was arrested by Baldwin Park police as he ran from the accident 
scene, testified that he had been in the back seat, where he had been nearly 
unconscious after smoking PCP and drinking 17 beers. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities said that his injuries -- a sore chest and cuts to the forehead 
-- were consistent with those that would have been suffered by the driver.

SAN GABRIEL RESPONDS TO RISE IN GANG VIOLENCE

<P>
A group of 50 residents told the City Council Tuesday that gang crime has 
become an epidemic here. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not whether a gang war exists in San Gabriel, but how bad is 
it?" said the Rev. Gerardo de Jesus, pastor of the Love Gospel Fellowship 
Church at La Casa de San Gabriel Community Center. "What we want is a program 
that is preventive in nature and educational." 
</P>
<P>
He cited the city's three gang-related killings since September, saying that 
the city must spend more money for programs that work directly with gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Group member Olivia Lopez told the council her 15-year-old nephew is a wanna-be 
-- someone who wants to be a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're asking for is a gang task force to come into the community and 
reach the wanna-bes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here tonight because I'm fighting for my nephew's life," Lopez told the 
council. "I'm asking the San Gabriel City Council for help, help in getting a 
program to get our youths off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Mayor James Castaneda formed an eight-member committee of 
community members and city and police officials. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will work with Los Angeles-based Community Youth Gang Services to 
develop a way for San Gabriel to deal with the problem of youngsters who will 
be idle in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda acknowledged that the gang problem is the worst it's "ever been in 
the 10 years that I have been here." 
</P>
<P>
Since December, Castaneda and Police Capt. David A. Lawton have been meeting 
with the group of residents, who call themselves the San Gabriel Community 
Interfaith Program. 
</P>
<P>
Lawton said: "I don't think that anybody is denying that there's a gang 
problem. But I see a cyclical gang problem. Right now, we're at a higher level 
of the cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Before the three gang-related killings in the past year, there had been none 
for two years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But De Jesus said some people think gang-related crime goes under-reported and 
that not enough is done by city and school officials to quickly remove gang 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much fear in the community," he said. "City officials and the 
powers that be seem not to take a real concern about it." 
</P>
<P>
In March, the City Council authorized a $25,000 reward for any information that 
leads to an arrest and a conviction in any of the three gang-related killings.

REPORT ON ELECTION WAS MISLEADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report (Times, April 15) on Monterey Park's election was misleading. In my 
opinion, the main reason incumbents Barry Hatch and Patricia Reichenberger lost 
so badly is because they had to run on a record riddled with mismanagement and 
bloody City Hall infighting. 
</P>
<P>
This is why they weren't reelected. It isn't because the city is " . . . 
reaching an era of mutual tolerance among ethnic groups . . . " as your 
reporter, Elizabeth Lu, put it. 
</P>
<P>
In her article, she relied too heavily on UCLA sociologist John Horton's study 
of Monterey Park's Asian community. I have watched his efforts from the 
beginning. It was never an objective study, but a propaganda effort supported 
by groups who seek to divide America into separate and unequal minority groups. 
Why divide Americans into these groups? 
</P>
<P>
In this election, a newcomer to civic leadership, (Asian-American) Sam Kiang, 
came in first. Councilman Fred Balderrama had the broad backing of a 
cross-section of the community, although he was described as a Latino during 
the campaign. To her credit, Councilwoman Marie Purvis was able to win without 
any labeling of her ethnic heritage at all. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, Kiang, Balderrama and Purvis didn't win because of their race. 
They won because they were qualified and the only alternative to four more 
years of Hatch and Reichenberger.

ONE DISTANCE SWIMMER'S LONELY ROAD; 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING: ST. BERNARD HIGH HAS NO SWIM TEAM. SO STEPHANIE MUSELLA MUST BE 
DRIVEN 35 MILES EACH DAY TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY HILLS CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephanie Musella is the loneliest swimmer at St. Bernard High School. She's 
also the only one. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic school dropped its swimming program in 1974, forcing 
aquatics lovers such as Musella to look elsewhere for training. 
</P>
<P>
So, every day after school and on weekends, Musella makes a 35-mile trek from 
her home in Westchester to the City of Industry to practice with her club team, 
the Industry Hills Aquatics Club. 
</P>
<P>
Industry Hills, regarded as one of the top swimming clubs in Southern 
California, has 200 members who work out in two pools on the grounds of a local 
hotel. Practices last three to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
The rigorous training schedule leaves Musella little time for school activities 
or outings with friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to decide what's most important in my life," said Musella, a 5-foot-4, 
115-pound junior distance swimmer. "Right now, swimming is very important to 
me. I'm sacrificing a lot to do it, but I feel it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Most competitive swimmers belong to a club team, but they also swim for their 
high school during the spring. Musella is one of only three Industry Hills 
senior members forced to skip the high school season. 
</P>
<P>
"A club team is important, but I think a high school team can be even more 
important," said Ed Spencer, Musella's coach at Industry Hills. "Kids get a lot 
more excitement and peer-group satisfaction in high school than they do on the 
club level. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed that a school the size of St. Bernard (1,300 students) doesn't have 
a swim team. It seems to me they would have at least 15 to 20 kids who would be 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
But according to Jim McClune, St. Bernard's athletic director, Musella is the 
only athlete at the school who has expressed interest in forming a swim team. 
</P>
<P>
"We really try to meet the demands of our student-athletes here," McClune said. 
"This year again we scheduled an informational meeting for those interested in 
forming a swim team. The only one who showed up was Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, if there was interest, we'd have a team. But when only one student 
wants it, it just doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that St. Bernard doesn't have its own pool, which may explain 
why it also doesn't field a water polo team. A lack of regulation-size 25-yard 
pools in the area is another obstacle. McClune said Loyola Marymount University 
has the only available pool nearby that would be suitable for a swim team. 
</P>
<P>
Musella, 16, attended public schools through the eighth grade and would have 
attended Westchester High, but it also doesn't field a swim team. She opted for 
nearby St. Bernard because of the quality of education and because classes 
there get out 30 minutes earlier than at Westchester, allowing her extra time 
to get to practices at Industry Hills. 
</P>
<P>
All this has its price. Since St. Bernard is a private school, Musella's family 
must pay $1,650 a year in tuition. It costs another $60 a month to belong to 
Industry Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Musella, who started her athletic career with swimming lessons at the age of 2 
and has a pool in her back yard, has been making the trip to the City of 
Industry for three years. Her mother, Barbara, picks her up after school. 
Musella uses the hourlong car ride to do homework. Even though she is old 
enough to 
</P>
<P>
drive, her mother continues chauffeuring her to provide this study time. 
</P>
<P>
"When you don't get home until 8 o'clock every night, you need all the extra 
studying time you can get," said Musella, an honors student who maintains a 3.8 
grade-point average. "I know a lot of people can't study in the car, but I've 
learned to get used to it. It doesn't bother me at all now." 
</P>
<P>
Learning to make the best of tough situations may best describe Musella's life 
for the past two years. An accomplished swimmer, she is constantly rearranging 
her schedule to keep her dream afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have visions of swimming in college and one day going to the Olympics," said 
Musella, who also had to skip the Girl Scouts when growing up because of 
swimming conflicts. "Those goals are what keep me going day in and day out. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm doing is not easy, and there are many days when I wonder why I keep 
going. But I love swimming too much to stop now. Besides, it's also a great way 
to stay in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Musella specializes in the distance races, including the 1,500- and 800-meter 
freestyles. She swims up to four miles a day in preparation. When she 
occasionally swims in a high school meet, Musella finds it easy going, since 
the longest event is 500 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Because Coach Spencer has difficulty finding quality meets for his club 
swimmers at this time of year, Musella has a special arrangement to take part 
in some high school competition. The CIF Southern Section office allows 
swimmers at member schools without teams an opportunity to compete as 
independents so that they can post qualifying times for the section 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Musella has a deal worked out with the El Segundo High swim team to participate 
in two dual meets and one invitational during the season. She is normally given 
an outside lane at these meets, and her points are scored for St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Musella made Southern Section 2-A Division championship qualifying times in the 
200-yard individual medley and 100-yard freestyle in a dual meet earlier this 
season, and hopes to qualify in her preferred events, the 500- and 200-yard 
freestyles, this Saturday at the West Covina Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying times for the Southern Section 2-A championship (in which El Segundo 
competes) are 5 minutes, 42.0 seconds in the 500-yard freestyle and 2:08.0 in 
the 200-yard freestyle, marks Musella said she will have little problem making. 
Her personal bests are 5:20 in the 500 and 2:01 in the 200. She has qualified 
for the Southern Section championships in those events the past two years, 
finishing eighth in the 500 on both occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"This year I am hoping for a top-six finish in both races," Musella said. "I 
was sick for the meet my freshman year, and I was just very nervous last year. 
I didn't swim my best times. I'm hoping things will be different this time." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section championships, which feature most of the top talent in 
Southern California, will be held May 11-12 at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Stephanie is a hard-working swimmer whose next step is the Junior Olympics and 
Senior Nationals," Spencer said. "She's closing in on the times needed to 
compete in those prestigious events. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Stephanie is one of the top 15 or 20 high school girl distance 
swimmers in Southern California. But because she doesn't have a high school 
team, she's really missing out on the notoriety many of those swimmers 
receive." 
</P>
<P>
Musella, however, isn't the first swimmer at St. Bernard who has been forced to 
get training elsewhere. Diane Graner, a star at UCLA from 1982-85 who holds the 
school's third-fastest times in the 200-meter individual medley and 100-meter 
backstroke, attended St. Bernard but competed for a club team in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Although most students at St. Bernard may not know that Musella is an 
accomplished swimmer, they will eventually find out about her talents. The 
school's yearbook is devoting an entire page to extraordinary after-school 
activities, and Musella is the featured student. 
</P>
<P>
What the student body will find out is that Musella is a one-woman swim team. 
They'll also learn that she finished third in the 1,500-meter freestyle 
(18:15.0) among 15- and 16-year-olds last August at the prestigious Western 
Zone Regionals in Phoenix. And they'll find out that no journey is too long 
when someone loves swimming. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a chance to get into the high school scene much," Musella said. 
"I have some regrets about that. My close friends know I swim, and they accept 
it. I miss out on a lot of things. But I look at it more that I'm gaining a 
valuable opportunity."

INNOVATION: A BUMPER CROP OF INDUSTRIAL HYPOCRISY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture, in this era of ruthlessly competitive global markets, a strategically 
vital industry running a healthy $18-billion annual trade surplus. Now factor 
in that this industry receives more than $10 billion in direct government 
subsidies and more than $1.2 billion in government-sponsored high-tech research 
and development. 
</P>
<P>
If Japan were doing this in silicon chips or West Germany in numerically 
controlled machine tools, the United States would be quick to threaten Super 
301 trade sanctions. The free marketeers in Washington would piously call for 
"level playing fields" and warn of the pernicious evils of "industrial policy." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that "strategically vital industry" is America's own agriculture. In 
fact, the United States has a long, rich (and expensive) history of government 
involvement in agriculture. From the Morrill Act of 1862 that established the 
land-grant colleges to today's emerging cornucopia of plant biotechnologies, 
it's impossible to imagine American agribusiness being so global without the 
not-so-invisible hand of American government. 
</P>
<P>
By any measure you wish to apply, every element of U.S. agribusiness history 
practically shrieks "industrial policy." "We've had a 'cheap food' policy in 
this country for years, using income transfers and other techniques to keep 
prices down," says Harold O. Carter, professor of agricultural economics and 
director of the UC Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis. "We'd be aghast if 
people had to pay $2 a pound for poultry." 
</P>
<P>
(By contrast, Carter says, European countries "really pampered" their farmers 
and that's why "food costs there have been so fantastic.") 
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Extension Service, the massively elaborate labyrinth of loans, 
subsidies and loan guarantees, and a willingness to fund new technologies have 
made the Department of Agriculture arguably one of the most successful 
practitioners of industrial policy. Today, as advances in biotechnology promise 
to transform agriculture, the USDA has cleverly positioned itself as a seed 
capitalist in this arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The USDA is clearly moving more toward science-based agricultural 
investments," asserts Mark F. Cantley, head of the European Economic 
Community's Concertation Unit for Biotechnology in Europe. Indeed, several 
European nations have quietly expressed unhappiness over America's increasing 
competitiveness in agricultural biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
I'm confused. When we talk about creating a new partnership between government 
and high-technology industries such as semiconductors, policy-makers thrust the 
free-market crucifix at the budget-sucking vampires of "industrial policy." 
When we continue a century-old tradition of technology transfer, educational 
investment and technological innovation in agriculture, it's called: nothing. 
There's nary a whisper in the cacophony of policy debate. 
</P>
<P>
When the head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) -- the 
Pentagon's high-tech venture capital arm -- champions the idea of investing to 
improve our industrial base, he gets demoted. When the USDA champions the idea 
of investing in new materials research and developing new agricultural 
products, it gets an R&amp;D budget of more than $1.2 billion. Trust me, 
agricultural biotechnology is at least as high tech as anything the Pentagon 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Irony is too nice a word to describe what's going on here. Washington is one of 
those towns where, if you're enough of a hypocrite, people actually start 
thinking you're a pragmatist. Intellectual integrity becomes a luxury to be 
jettisoned at the first sign of a negative poll. The Washington troika of 
Richard G. Darman, Michael J. Boskin and John H. Sununu can bray all they want 
about the economic sins of industrial policy -- but, clever gentlemen that they 
are, they also know how to count votes. 
</P>
<P>
Apply the same standards of free-market philosophical purity to the USDA that 
these policy-makers profess, and the agency would be defunded. That will never 
happen. The political power of the Farm Belt, California and Texas is just too 
strong. What's more, there are actually legislators who care about upgrading 
the quality of life in rural America; there are people who want to use the 
agricultural infrastructure to make sure that America's farmers have ready 
access to tools and techniques to make them more productive. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a legitimate role for government here? "Yes, in terms of maintaining 
our competitiveness, reducing dependence on subsidies and creating new products 
and services," says USDA Assistant Secretary for Science and Education Charles 
E. Hess, formerly the dean of the College of Agriculture at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hess points out, Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) required that the USDA spend 
$50 million to help farmers explore "non-feed, non-food" crops for their lands. 
Hess sees the USDA playing a more aggressive role in promoting the development 
of biodegradable materials and as a "positive source" of plant-based fuels such 
as methanol versus fossil fuels such as oil and coal to combat air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, "after a fair amount of discussion" with the Office of Management 
and Budget, says Hess, the USDA could actually fund initiatives to 
commercialize emerging agricultural technologies. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson here is a cynical one: The "debates" surrounding industrial policy 
in Washington have little to do with principle and a fundamental belief in the 
strength of free markets. On the contrary, our experience with agriculture 
proves that the government can be a powerful and productive partner with 
private industry. Talk with anyone in agribusiness, and they will tell you that 
the networks of land-grant colleges, the Agricultural Extension Service and the 
research stations played a critical role in consolidating America's 
agricultural pre-eminence. 
</P>
<P>
What the debates about industrial policy and high technology really reveal is 
that America's high-tech companies lack political clout. The Intels, Motorolas, 
Hewlett-Packards and Crays may be technical wizards, but they are legislative 
eunuches. They are incapable of mustering the sort of political pressure, 
political action committee money and votes that agribusiness historically has. 
</P>
<P>
I want to make it clear that I'm not a big fan of government intervention in 
specific industries; I would be leery of any kind of American Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry or civilian DARPA. On the other hand, I'm a 
huge fan of honesty and integrity. Those are two qualities that too many 
high-ranking Washington policy-makers have made optional.

CFTC Chairman Defends Agency: Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman 
Wendy Gramm said Wall Street jealousy was behind calls for giving the rival 
Securities and Exchange Commission some or all of her agency's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two motives," Gramm said in a speech to the futures industry. 
"First, the SEC wants more regulatory power." The second is that "some on Wall 
Street want to turn back the clock to an earlier time" because "the securities 
sector is jealous of the performance and market share of the futures market."

Pact to Buy Watergate Hotel Reported: Trusthouse Forte Hotels Inc., operator of 
the Travelodge chain, announced it has assumed management of the Watergate 
Hotel in Washington and has agreed to buy the multistory structure. 
</P>
<P>
Financial terms of the planned acquisition of the hotel and a health club, 
owned by the British Coal Board pension fund, were not disclosed. Trusthouse 
Forte is the U.S. subsidiary of Trusthouse Forte PLC, a $4-billion British 
hotel and catering company. The subsidiary is headquartered in El Cajon, which

American General Corp. stunned shareholders and one suitor Wednesday by putting 
itself up for sale, in an auction expected to fetch $7 billion for the nation's 
fourth-largest insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock price jumped sharply higher after the announcement at 
American General's annual shareholders meeting, where the anticipated event had 
been a showdown with hostile suitor Torchmark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Harold S. Hook, American General's chairman, said the company decided to put 
itself up for auction because it was vulnerable to a possible takeover at a 
discount price and wanted to realize the maximum value for its stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
American General stock finished up $7.50 at $47.625 a share as the most 
actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials and analysts said they expected the bidding for American 
General to reach about $7 billion, or more than $55 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham, Ala.-based Torchmark had made an unsolicited $6.34-billion, or $50 
per share, cash and stock buyout offer for American General in March. But 
Torchmark later withdrew the offer, opting instead to wage a proxy fight to 
elect its own five nominees to the 15-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Since then each company has been vigorously urging shareholders to support its 
board nominees.

COURT OVERTURNS INSIDER TRADING CONVICTION; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: THE COURT OF APPEALS RULING INVOLVING A STOCKBROKER NARROWS THE 
DEFINITION OF INSIDER TRADING TO EXCLUDE A LONG CHAIN OF TIPSTERS.

In a key ruling on insider trading, an appeals court Wednesday overturned the 
conviction of a stockbroker who bought Waldbaum supermarket stock after 
learning about the company's imminent sale from a Waldbaum family member. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals said it could find no evidence that 
former Gruntal &amp; Co. broker Robert Chestman knew the information about the 
1986 sale of the supermarket chain was confidential. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling narrows the definition of insider trading to exclude a lengthy chain 
of tipsters, which defense lawyers in the case had labeled "family gossip." 
</P>
<P>
Insider trading lacks a statutory definition but generally refers to buying or 
selling securities on the basis of confidential, nonpublic information. 
</P>
<P>
The case had expanded securities law interpretation to encompass disclosure of 
secrets down a chain and hinged on whether Chestman had a fiduciary duty to 
Waldbaum Inc. No prior criminal case had involved confidential information 
passed among family members. 
</P>
<P>
Chestman, who began serving his two-year prison sentence last June, was 
expected to be released from a minimum-security prison in Allenwood, Pa., 
almost immediately, Chestman attorney Alan J. Brudner said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Attorney's Office was reviewing the ruling and had not decided on 
whether to appeal to the Supreme Court or for an appellate court rehearing, 
spokeswoman Deborah Corley said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to confirm everything we've been saying about this case from the 
start," attorney Brudner said. "A chain of family gossip is not what the 
securities laws were intended to address, at least not in this case." 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony at Chestman's trial, Ira Waldbaum agreed in 1986 to sell 
the grocery business founded by his grandfather in 1921 to the Great Atlantic 
&amp; Pacific Tea Co. -- better known as A&amp;P -- for $50 a share, or $28.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
He told his sister, Shirley Witkin, about the deal, stressing that the 
information had to remain confidential until it was announced publicly. Witkin 
informed her daughter, Susan Loeb, who in turn told her husband, Keith. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Loeb then told Chestman, who bought 11,000 shares of Waldbaum Inc. for 
about $25 each, making overnight profits of $250,000 for himself and several 
clients, including Loeb. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission, alerted to the trading by routine 
post-merger stock market surveillance, filed civil charges. Loeb cooperated 
with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Chestman was charged criminally and convicted by a jury in May, 1989, on 31 
counts. The civil charges are pending. 
</P>
<P>
But the appeals court said in reversing the conviction: "It cannot be inferred 
that Chestman had constructive knowledge of the confidentiality of this 
information simply because he knew Loeb's wife to be a member of the Waldbaum 
family." 
</P>
<P>
The judges also said they could find no evidence that members of the Waldbaum 
family had a history of trusting each other with business confidences. 
</P>
<P>
Chestman's conviction had hinged on whether Loeb had a duty to the Waldbaum 
company via the family and whether Chestman knew he was breaching it. 
</P>
<P>
Loeb testified at the trial that he called Chestman, a senior vice president at 
Gruntal and his broker since 1982, on the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 26. "I 
told him that Waldbaum's is about to be sold and it would be substantially 
higher than it was currently trading at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loeb did not cite his source or say the information was confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Chestman's attorneys said he had decided to serve the prison term before his 
appeal was decided because he felt he couldn't get a job until the case was 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Chestman, who was to be released to a halfway house in August and paroled in 
November, had not immediately been told of the decision, Brudner said.

House Panel Votes to Subpoena Milken: A House subcommittee has decided to offer 
junk bond financier Michael Milken immunity from prosecution so that he will 
testify before Congress, a panel aide said. The Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations voted unanimously in a closed 
session to subpoena Milken, who pleaded guilty last week to six felony counts 
and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and restitution. If Milken receives 
immunity from the full panel, nothing he says at the hearing could be used 
against him in court.

SIMON GROUP'S S&amp;L IN HAWAII GETS INFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles investment group led by former Treasury Secretary William E. 
Simon and lawyer Gerald L. Parsky disclosed Wednesday that they received a 
$50-million infusion from a Hawaiian educational trust for a Honolulu-based 
thrift the group owns. 
</P>
<P>
The infusion into Honfed Bank from the Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop 
Estate is in lieu of a public offering of preferred stock that the two men 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to offer the stock to the public was considered an audacious move 
because industry turmoil has left all but a few savings and loans nationwide 
out of favor with investors. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Parsky said he believes that the infusion is the first equity 
investment made in a large thrift since the government's S&amp;L reform 
legislation was signed into law last August. Parsky denied that the stock sale 
was going badly, adding that investment bankers Smith Barney, Harris Upham 
&amp; Co. believed that it could have sold the stock. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Honfed Bank, which has $3.2 billion in assets, was $65 
million short of what it needed to meet new federal levels for capital, or 
money that banks and thrifts maintain to protect against losses. Parsky said 
the infusion from the foundation, combined with profit made in the first six 
months of this year, should bring the thrift in line with the new capital 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate is a private education 
trust founded by descendants of Hawaiian royalty. The trust was also an 
investor with the Simon group in First Interstate Bank of Hawaii. In February, 
the group disclosed plans to sell that bank to First Hawaiian Inc. in a 
lucrative deal in which investors are expected to receive double what they put 
in when the group bought the bank a year ago.

Los Angeles-based Unocal agreed Wednesday to buy Prairie Holding, an 
exploratory subsidiary of Placer Dome that also produces crude oil and natural 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
It will pay $252 million in cash and assume $84 million in debts and other 
liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal said Prairie will add more than 20,000 acres of potential energy fields 
in East Texas and Louisiana, along with interests in three gas-processing 
plants. The operations integrate with its existing operations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with one of the key operating goals, to expand the company's 
resource space, and it's an excellent geographic fit for us," said Unocal 
spokesman Barry Lane. "Prairie has had a very successful exploration program, 
and we really like the look of the lands they have and they should mesh very 
well with ours." 
</P>
<P>
Prairie will become part of Union Exploration Partners, a master limited 
partnership in which Unocal and its Union Oil Co. of California operating 
subsidiary hold a 95% stake. 
</P>
<P>
Prairie's net daily production is 36 million cubic feet of natural gas, 4,100 
barrels of hydrocarbon liquids and 106 long tons of sulfur, a Unocal spokesman 
said. BRUCE KEPPEL

Little Lanxide Corp. was barely a spot on the map of the vast chemical and 
materials industry dominated by the likes of Dow and Du Pont until, less than a 
year after its birth in 1983, Lanxide was tapped on the shoulder by an obscure 
Pentagon agency. 
</P>
<P>
Getting anointed with a mere $1 million from the government gave Lanxide the 
credibility it needed to attract $250 million more from private investors and 
big corporate partners, including its Delaware neighbor Du Pont Co. 
</P>
<P>
Today Lanxide employs 350 people and is on the verge of seeing its versatile 
ceramic materials incorporated into protective shields for soldiers and tanks 
as well as industrial uses ranging from airplane parts to mining equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Stories like Lanxide's, of how a little money from the small Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency has made a big difference, are likely to be told with 
growing passion around Washington these days as the debate resumes over the 
role of government in sustaining certain industries. 
</P>
<P>
Ignited by the abrupt removal late last month of the Pentagon agency's earnest 
director, Craig Fields, the squabble threatens to drag once-obscure DARPA into 
a messy political bout that insiders fear could irreparably damage what is 
widely acclaimed to be among the most effective of all federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Although he probably never meant to play the role, Fields, in his year as 
DARPA's outspoken chief, had come to symbolize the view that the nation must 
make a dramatic shift away from the arm's-length government-business 
relationship that has seen it through four decades of stunning industrial 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Popular on Capitol Hill, but anathema to the Bush Administration, is the notion 
that government should somehow help shore up certain key industries -- not 
specific companies, but underlying commercial technologies such as the making 
of computer chips and advanced materials -- in the same way that it played a 
role in building a national transportation system of highways and railroads. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a turning point," said Bell Laboratories President Ian Ross. "The 
government should not just be supporting basic research but it also should be 
supporting generic, precompetitive technology that does have an impact on our 
industrial strength." 
</P>
<P>
With the worldwide easing of military tensions, the simmering debate over 
whether government should play a larger role in key areas of the private sector 
-- so-called industrial policy -- is growing more complex. More than ever, 
economic competitiveness is an important factor in the global balance of power, 
blurring the lines between what is good for the military and what is good for 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration would generally prefer that the government stick to 
weapons, period. But beyond that is an assortment of positions, ranging from 
those who want a stronger industrial base because it's good for the Pentagon to 
those who say government involvement can be justified, much like in Japan, on 
purely economic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of closing the book on this nagging debate, as the Administration 
apparently had hoped, the mysterious transfer of Fields by Pentagon higher-ups 
would seem to throw it wide open, offering a window of opportunity to business 
and political leaders who back a variety of proposals for expanding 
government's links with industry. 
</P>
<P>
How did DARPA land in the center of the dispute? 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the maverick agency has been remarkably successful at doing 
just what Administration ideology abhors: meddling in the private sector as a 
sort of high-tech venture capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
"The record of DARPA is spectacular," said C. Gordon Bell, a noted computer 
designer and the former assistant director of the National Science Foundation. 
"It's the only part of the government that is producing anything that is 
keeping the country afloat." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in reaction to the 1957 Soviet launch of Sputnik, DARPA has shown 
considerable skill at fulfilling its charter to pursue "high-risk" technologies 
with potentially high payoffs. Sheltered from the whipsaw of partisan politics, 
its clubby, sometimes cocky technologists, many armed with Ph.D.s and a nonstop 
sense of excitement, are given considerable latitude to put money into projects 
at both universities and companies. 
</P>
<P>
Operating out of shabby quarters in a Rosslyn, Va., office building, the staff 
of 140 oversees a budget of $1.2 billion, just 3% of the Pentagon's research 
and development funding and slightly more than 1% of total federal R&amp;D 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
All along, the thrust of DARPA's efforts has been to strengthen the military -- 
not industry. It backed some of the early research leading to the Stealth 
aircraft, for example. It funded work on a type of acoustic sensor, shunned at 
first by the Navy but later adopted for submarine tracking. It developed 
techniques for simulating combat now used by the Army to train soldiers. And 
the agency, having funded research in seismic detection of nuclear blasts, 
advises U.S. participants in disarmament talks. 
</P>
<P>
The unit has also had its share of flops. After spending $200 million, it 
closed the books two years ago on an experimental combination 
helicopter-airplane. Another project that has fallen short was a scheme to use 
so-called artificial intelligence to guide a combat vehicle over rough terrain. 
</P>
<P>
While most of its money goes to specialized Pentagon projects, the agency is 
better known for its uncanny ability, proven long before the buzzword "dual 
use" came into vogue, to delicately finesse research results with both civilian 
and military payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, as in the case of Lanxide, the projects begin with purely military 
intentions. Acting quickly, after only two months of talks, DARPA seeded 
Lanxide with the initial $1 million in the hopes of spawning a ceramic material 
that could be used for armor. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that was important to the company was finding somebody 
outside that was technically qualified that could say, yes, this is 
significant, or it isn't," said President Marc Newkirk, who was an unemployed 
materials scientist before founding Lanxide. DARPA's nod, he said, helped the 
fledgling firm attract private funding to leverage its research into commercial 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Other DARPA projects begin with less specific targets but only a sense that the 
generic technologies would somehow benefit national defense. So it was with 
DARPA's backing of research that proved seminal in the advancement of computer 
science, including the design of fast microprocessor chips and techniques for 
sending data over telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
Some say he's wildly exaggerating, but Michael Dertouzos, director of the 
Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
figures that $1 billion funneled out by DARPA over 25 years spawned half of a 
$400-billion computer and computer-related industry. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most dramatic example, a clutch of Stanford University computer 
scientists working a decade ago under DARPA contracts acted on the agency's 
encouragement to set up private companies. Three of the resulting firms -- Sun 
Microsystems, MIPS Computer Systems and Silicon Graphics -- today employ 12,000 
people and have combined annual sales of roughly $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The developments we did on DARPA budgets were things other companies were 
ignoring," said Andreas Bechtolsheim, a Sun co-founder and vice president of 
technology. "Without DARPA, it might never have happened this way." 
</P>
<P>
To those who believe in an expanded role for the government as an industrial 
godfather, DARPA's Fields had emerged as an unlikely hero. Seeming to worry 
about commercial competitiveness, he has expressed concern, for instance, over 
the increasing number of U.S. high-tech firms falling into Japanese hands. 
</P>
<P>
Among 151 firms that control the U.S. industry producing semiconductor 
equipment, for example, more than 30 have been acquired or received funding 
from Japanese firms in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Fields, who declined to comment for this story, has been a firm proponent of 
Sematech, the novel semiconductor-manufacturing research center funded by both 
DARPA and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
He strongly advocated -- but backed with a relatively meager $30 million -- 
efforts to revive a large-scale consumer electronics industry by fostering 
research in high-definition television displays. And most recently, in a move 
that may have led to his transfer, Fields authorized funding of a small Silicon 
Valley chip firm under a new program that allows DARPA to share financially in 
the company's success. 
</P>
<P>
But none of these efforts actually represents radical departures from some of 
DARPA's earlier activities. "What (Fields) was doing could have been justified 
in terms of just building the defense technology base," said William Perry, a 
former undersecretary of defense and now a matchmaker for high-tech firms. "He 
seems to have been caught in a semantics war of whether it was industrial 
policy or whether it was doing just well-conceived defense technology 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
What did rankle Pentagon bosses, according to Administration sources, is that 
Fields and DARPA were swept into the limelight. Bright and articulate, 
43-year-old Fields played well with high-tech industrialists and on Capitol 
Hill, where he appeared at least to ally with Democrats who have "economic 
competitiveness" high on their political agenda. 
</P>

The official word from the Pentagon is that nothing will change at DARPA except 
the person at the top. Many outsiders, however, think the agency will be 
expected to tie its funding more closely to specific military projects, 
shunting aside anything that might smell of bolstering industry, even in the 
interests of defense.

ARCHITECTURE: INSPIRATIONAL RAY AT DESIGN'S CUTTING EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MULTIDISCIPLINARY SDSU PROFESSOR EUGENE RAY IMPRESSES UPON HIS 
STUDENTS THE NEED FOR CREATIVITY.

<P>
One of the most provocative and least visible local architects is Eugene Ray, 
head of the environmental design program at San Diego State University for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, a multidisciplinary thinker in the tradition of Buckminster Fuller, hasn't 
found widespread acceptance for his ideas, yet he remains committed to new 
materials, forms based on nature, a sensitivity to ecology and his strong 
belief that each project is a chance to invent something new. 
</P>
<P>
He is a veteran advocate for architecture as art, for buildings that serve a 
higher inspirational purpose besides solving functional problems. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why the graduate and undergraduate programs in environmental 
design at San Diego State are part of the art department. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt art departments were the more creative places," said Ray, who 
noted with pleasure that Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry turned down a 
position as dean of the architecture school at USC a few years back when 
administrators wouldn't move it to the art department. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his peers on the unconventional cutting edge, Ray has found much 
of his praise abroad, in Japanese design journals such as A+U and Domus, and in 
exhibitions such as the 1985 Paris Biennale, which included his work. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll find that there is a broader appreciation of design in places like 
Italy, Japan and France," explains Ray, a compact, humble man who doesn't get 
overtly emotional about the slights he's felt in his own country. "There isn't 
this hesitancy to try something new simply because it's new." 
</P>
<P>
Ray's large classroom and adjacent office are filled to the rafters with 
drawings, models, books, magazines and other items collected during his career. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the artifacts, you sense a different aesthetic at work. Ray's 
commitment to non-rectilinear forms extends to the way he displays colorful 
architectural drawings and photographs -- on sheets with rounded edges he trims 
with a coffee can to eliminate square corners. 
</P>
<P>
He believes curves are more soothing than angles, and this carries into his 
architecture. Cones and spheres make the most pleasing environments for humans, 
he says, partly because they minimize the impact of electromagnetic radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Even writer Ray Bradbury found Ray's creativity impressive. In a personal 
letter to the architect in 1972, he referred to Ray as a fellow "jackdaw." 
</P>
<P>
"You are a jackdaw, of course, like myself, collecting bright objects, ideas, 
and tumbling them together in a kaleidoscope to see what prism lights hit the 
sides of your skull and other peoples' brainpans. How I wish you were in charge 
of brightening up most cities . . . like Century City here, or the Universal 
Studios black-soot building which needs a big symbol of orange on its side to 
make it look enterable." 
</P>
<P>
Ray's lectures ramble freely over many disciplines, from art to architecture to 
pop culture to the recent Earth Day -- he and his students built a dome from 
recycled carpeting tubes for the on-campus celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in improving realities," he tells a small group of 
environmental design students gathered to hear one of his talks. "Movies show a 
reality above and beyond real life. Our goal is to make real life as exciting 
as movies." 
</P>
<P>
The projects he and his young proteges dream up are unlike anything you've seen 
around town: assorted domes, combinations of spheres and cones, houses with 
walls made of compacted earth, frameworks built from PVC pipe, lightweight 
environments of thin, taut fabric, prototypes for housing using new materials 
being pioneered by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's design philosophies are broader-based than most. He's been talking about 
ecology and energy conservation since before the first Earth Day. He sees it as 
significant in his life that the Whole Earth Catalog -- a bible of '60s 
alternative living -- won a Pulitzer Prize in 1969, the year he brought his own 
rarefied thinking to San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
His conversations are peppered with terms he has invented or picked up from 
visionaries like Fuller: "radiant architecture" (which takes into account 
light, color and electromagnetic radiation), "synergetic environments" (which 
combine elements in such a way that the sum is greater than the parts), 
"biomorphic" (designs based on nature) and "biotronics" (a happy marriage 
between biomorphic forms and electromagnetic radiation). 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he's been more of an academic than a practicing architect, but 
he has a lengthy resume of building credits dating back to the houses he 
designed in New Orleans -- his home town -- after he earned a master's in 
architecture from Tulane University. 
</P>
<P>
"Silver Ship" is what he calls his home on Nautilus Street in La Jolla, which 
clings to its steep hillside like a space station, or, as Ray would probably 
prefer it described, a large living organism. Canopies resemble eyelids, curved 
windows on hinges flap up and down like wings. Using such economical yet catchy 
materials as corrugated aluminum, Ray built it over several years, with the 
help of students, at a cost of $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
He still finds time for the occasional design job. Students are collaborating 
with him on a master plan and building designs for Madre Grande, an alternative 
community in Dulzura in East County. A Native Indian Cultural Center with a 
tent-like conical form awaits a San Diego site and funding. And Ray's 
lightweight fiberglass covers for an archeological excavation in Presidio Park 
are also waiting for funding. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ray's designs often seem futuristic or perhaps timeless, completely 
outside architecture's mainstream, he is also committed to architectural 
history. He's written letters and reports in favor of saving such local 
landmarks as architect R.M. Schindler's El Pueblo Ribera apartments in La 
Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Ray's students have gone on to productive careers in architecture or 
other design-related fields, even though his lack of emphasis on such practical 
matters as drafting and management can leave them scrambling for supplemental 
education once they graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"His classes were eye opening," said San Diego architect Kotaro Nakamura, who 
earned a master's degree under Ray and is now a fellow professor at the 
university. "I had strict engineering training in Japan. Eugene opened my 
creative side, and I owe him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"The program was so loose that it didn't constrict me," said local artist Mario 
Lara, best known for his temporary architectural installations. "I was 
encouraged to go in my own direction, as opposed to other programs, where they 
make you fit a cookie cutter and you get squeezed out the other end." 
</P>
<P>
With energy conservation, low-cost housing, and environmental concerns all 
coming belatedly into the limelight, San Diegans, especially architects, could 
do well to take another look at Ray's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
His buildings are unconventional and not elegant in traditional ways, but his 
concern for humanistic values over materialistic ones seems more timely than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>

SOCIETY: TALENT, APPETITES IN FULL BLOOM AS CELEBRITIES COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A lot of women have spent the past quarter of a century or so fighting their 
way out of the kitchen, but at Saturday's "Celebrities Cook for the UCSD Cancer 
Center" at the Sheraton Harbor Island, a double sextet of them suggested that 
they never feel quite so at home as when they are home, home at the range. 
</P>
<P>
The Champagne Ballroom, the perennial site of the "Celebrities Cook" gala, 
again rang to the toothsome tattoo of whisks beating against metal bowls when 
gala founder and four-time chairman Anne Otterson pulled out the ninth version 
of the fund-raiser, this time styled "A Feast of Flowers." 
</P>
<P>
The name presaged not a banquet of posies -- although there was one Bud in the 
attendance of 500 and dinner plates were garnished with a blossom or two -- but 
rather celebrated, according to the program, "the flowering achievements of 
many distinguished women." Among the distinguished whose talents bloomed 
Saturday were six professional chefs who supervise the kitchens at leading 
restaurants here and in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and six local 
women designated "celebrated hostesses." 
</P>
<P>
All 12 of these women, aided to greater or lesser degrees by sous chefs, toiled 
and troubled at elegantly decorated cooking stations arranged at either end of 
the room. Real stoves put out real heat -- and so did hungry guests clamoring 
for seconds of the nibbles each cooking team offered -- but nary a coiffure 
melted, and, though some dresses were ruffled, tempers never were. 
</P>
<P>
"A Feast of Flowers" produced net proceeds of more than $200,000 for the cancer 
center, a figure that center board President David Rubel said brings the total 
earned by "Celebrities Cook" to about $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The women who put this party together every year have done, all by themselves, 
much more than they may realize." said Rubel. "When you multiply the money 
they've raised over the years at 'Celebrities Cook' by all the matching grants 
we receive, this party has raised $15 million for the cancer center." 
</P>
<P>
Otterson wrote the basic menu for Celebrities Cook in 1982 and changed it only 
slightly this year. As before, the evening opened with a two-hour tasting at 
the booths and continued with a rather lavish dinner and dancing to the Bill 
Coleman Band. As a change from years gone by, the event did not include a panel 
of celebrity judges or a competition among the cooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've chaired four out of nine 'Celebrities Cook,' and this is my swan song," 
Otterson said. "But it's been worth it all these years because we don't raise 
money just for research, but for patient benefits, too. We like to say that our 
proceeds go 'from the laboratory bench to the bedside.' " 
</P>
<P>
At their booths around the room, the professional chefs looked only slightly 
more harried than in their own kitchens. La Jolla's Cindy Black offered up 
slivers of silky grilled eggplant; Evan Kleiman of Angeli Caffe in Los Angeles 
also served eggplant, and Tracy Pikhart Ritter of Escondido's Golden Door 
dished up spiced chicken with lemon couscous. 
</P>
<P>
Other pros were Joyce Goldstein of San Francisco's Square One and Anne 
Rosensweig of Arcadia in New York, but the busiest booth was that of San 
Franciscan Barbara Tropp, who cooked up hundreds of the curried spring rolls 
she invented at her China Moon Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Guests armed with forks and small plates circled the room constantly, but the 
crowds were often thickest at the booth where hostess Sally Thornton and sous 
chef Martha Culbertson handed out wedges of a cake of layered corn crepes and 
crisp duck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a regular feeding frenzy here," said one guest as she went back for 
seconds. The business was also brisk at Linda Hahn's sopa de tortilla kitchen, 
at Isabelle Wasserman's piroshki booth and at the booth where Dorene Whitney 
offered canapes topped with olive tapenade. 
</P>
<P>
Hostess Lee Goldberg stopped drizzling sauteed oysters with cucumber sauce just 
long enough to point her ladle coyly at a guest and say, "Of course I made this 
myself -- with John Baylin's help." Caterer Baylin then directed her attention 
to yet another tray oysters in need of sauce and Goldberg went back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Dixie Unruh, a previous "Celebrities Cook" contestant, returned as a hostess 
and brought along 500 bruschetta canapes topped with a spicy tomato mixture. 
Hoisting a blushing Roma tomato in the palm of her hand, Unruh said: "This is 
what I call the 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!' I won the battle, but I had to 
peel 250 of these tomatoes, and I don't know if I can ever face another one." 
Her husband, Ken Unruh, served as sous chef. 
</P>
<P>
Most guests took an indulgent attitude toward these snacks and found the seated 
dinner in some ways redundant, although, as befitted a cooking party, it was 
elegantly done and consisted of smoked salmon in a crisp, flower-shaped pastry 
cup, beef filet stuffed with ratatouille, and a light marjolaine cake. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the "Feast of Flowers" theme, the table centerpieces were 
brilliant topiaries of spring flowers rising from white planter boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Key committee posts were held by Lyn Heller, Judee Feinberg, Lynne Schulnik, 
Suzie Eisenman, Minna Melton, Nancy Chase, Pam Wischkaemper, Shirley Rubel, 
Joany Mosher, Barbara McColl, Shirley Gillespie, Alyson Goudy, Corrine 
Gruenwald, Audrey Geisel, Marie Olesen and Jeanne Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending were Sheri and Ben Kelts, Peggy and Peter Preuss, 
Charmaine and Maurice Kaplan, Mary and Bruce Hazard, the Douglas Pauls, Howard 
Birndorf, Dottie and David Garfield, the Michael Stringers, the Richard Levis, 
the John Sutherlands, Barbara Bloom, Bobbie and Blaine Quick, Lael and Jay 
Kovtun, Jody and Earle Honnen and Bebe and Marvin Zigman.

LOVE WITH A PERFECT STRANGER; 
</P>
<P>
MATCHMAKERS: FROM INTRODUCTIONS TO BACKGROUND CHECKS, GO-BETWEENS STILL FIND 
SPOUSES FOR SOME MEMBERS OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arnie was shy. Until he was matched with Debra. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the first girl I actually ever spent time with," said Arnie, a North 
Hollywood Orthodox Jew. "I was so shy that one time a rabbi actually dialed her 
phone number for me to make sure we talked." 
</P>
<P>
Suresh Iyengar, a Sherman Oaks dentist, received a modern education at USC, but 
he journeyed back in time to find a wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an accomplished bachelor," Iyengar recalls about his 1973 visit to his 
native India. "It was time to get a wife." 
</P>
<P>
And Walid Dinkha, about to embark on his new life in America, figured that he 
had found the perfect partner in his Iraqi neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't met her, but I knew the raw material, what she's made of, from her 
family," Dinkha, of North Hollywood, said. "I knew her father was a fair man, 
and that her mother would treat me like her own sons." 
</P>
<P>
Together, all three men illustrate that, even as their own ethnic communities 
have assimilated into the San Fernando Valley, they stick by the traditional 
ways of finding their wives. Their marriages are carefully arranged, and while 
both sexes have equal free will to back out or find someone else, the pressure 
on them is often severe. 
</P>
<P>
As the Valley -- and, seemingly, the rest of America -- resorts to video dating 
and nightclub mixers, they cling to the past. They say it's the best way. It 
keeps their communities alive and minimizes the chance of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"He and I have made it," said Iyengar's wife, Malathi. "But it doesn't end 
there. We fit into the whole community. It's not just a marriage between us; 
it's a bond between our families, and within our culture." 
</P>
<P>
Said Michelle Linson, an Orthodox Jew, of North Hollywood: "I have unreligious 
friends who told me recently that they wished someone had investigated their 
husbands, and maybe they wouldn't be divorced now." 
</P>
<P>
Dating, said Arnie's wife, Debra, can be hazardous to your mental and physical 
health. That's why a more traditional approach, in which potential dating 
partners are actually investigated by rabbis, makes a lot of sense. 
</P>
<P>
"You're meeting people that someone else knows," said Debra. "You're not going 
to go out with Jack the Ripper." 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox Jews normally utilize the services of a shadchan, or matchmaker, who 
seems to know everyone in the community. As the leader of the community's study 
sessions, the local rabbi often plays that role. 
</P>
<P>
In North Hollywood, that falls to Rabbi Zvi Block, dean of the Aisha Torah 
religious school. He estimates that he has set up more than 100 couples in the 
past decade who eventually married. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the idea of dating? To go bowling? To go to a movie?" asked Block. "No. 
The idea of dating for us is to find a lasting and meaningful relationship. 
There are going to be problems but by matching up the right people, I can 
minimize them." 
</P>
<P>
Block offers matches on his own or listens to input from others. Often, someone 
will approach him, asking if could find out whether a member of the opposite 
sex might be interested in dating. 
</P>
<P>
Block then reports the responses. He says that if one partner doesn't want to 
see the other again, hearing the news from him can be more soothing. 
</P>
<P>
Each party always has a choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Many think that marriages between Orthodox Jews are prearranged, that they 
meet under the canopy for the first time," said Barry Linson, Michelle's 
husband. "That's a stereotype of what went on in Europe. Even non-religious 
Jews have that impression. But they've always had a choice." (The impression 
might have been encouraged by the 1960s play and movie, "Fiddler on the Roof," 
in which Tevye tries to arrange a marriage between his daughter, Tzeitel, and 
the well-to-do middle-aged butcher she hardly knew.) 
</P>
<P>
Block also becomes involved in developing romances even if he isn't the 
original matchmaker. Recently, a concerned woman called him in need of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"He has certainly impressed me as a sincere fellow," said Block, to the woman 
who had just dated the man for the first time. "He's very strait-laced, very 
learned. You can't go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Block doesn't hesitate to present discouraging information. "If I had 
reservations," he said, "I might say that the person isn't as committed to 
Judaism as he should be. I'm not here to slander people." 
</P>
<P>
The Linsons are grateful for Block's assistance. Michelle Linson considered 
herself a "poor judge of character" and needed an expert's opinion. She 
encouraged the rabbi to meet Barry, her future husband, for lunch. "I wanted to 
know if he was really who he pretended to be," Michelle Linson said. "I 
remember calling the rabbi that same day. 'Is he for real? Is he as good a guy 
as he seems?' " 
</P>
<P>
By last month, Jonathan -- not his real name -- had spent a decade searching 
for the proper mate. Twice before, he had even proposed to women but was turned 
down. At 36, his doubts were mounting -- would he be a bachelor forever? The 
constant sight of visiting homes on the Sabbath with happy marriages and kids 
roaming everywhere was uplifting, and depressing. He quickly made it known to 
friends in the community that he was searching for a wife. Soon, Marlene -- not 
her real name -- more aggressive than most, called. 
</P>
<P>
They went out for the first time in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in my body said yes the first time we met," Jonathan said. "I knew 
she was the one." 
</P>
<P>
They dated again, and again. They spent hours each night on the phone. Each did 
his or her obligatory background check with Rabbi Block and other religious 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In two weeks, they will be married. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned when she said yes," Jonathan said. "I am so happy." 
</P>
<P>
In Indian culture, there is no designated matchmaker. Each family, in its own 
way, makes arrangements for their children. And while the tradition has lost 
some of its stature in the last several decades because of advanced education 
and modernization, many marriages are still arranged. 
</P>
<P>
By 1973, when Suresh Iyengar returned to Bombay to find a wife, his parents had 
prepared the groundwork; in just a few weeks, he would choose a woman from a 
list of carefully selected candidates. He was a great catch -- primed for a 
career as a professional in America. 
</P>
<P>
He was set up with young women from well-respected families; still bound by the 
ancient caste system, parents seek to match their offspring with members of the 
same class. 
</P>
<P>
Things did not go well. Either the women weren't ready to move to the United 
States, or Iyengar wasn't impressed with their character. He was going to give 
up. He had to return to America and his new life as a dentist. One more 
candidate, his parents pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
The two families got together. Iyengar and the last possibility, Malathi, then 
only 19, talked briefly. They met again a few days later. By the end of the 
week, they were married. 
</P>
<P>
While there was significant pressure from both families for them to get 
engaged, Suresh and Malathi reserved final say. (Rose Nair, an employee at the 
government of India's Tourist Office in Los Angeles, says old-fashioned 
arranged marriages, in which neither partner had a choice, occur these days 
only in small countryside villages; in the larger cities, the practice is not 
nearly as confining. In some cases, families pick future spouses for their 
children before they even reach adolescence.) 
</P>
<P>
When they finally settled in Sherman Oaks in the mid-'70s, life was not easy 
for them, especially for Malathi. She missed her family and her country. She 
was in a strange land, with a stranger in her bed. 
</P>
<P>
"When we had to deal with problems," Malathi said, "I really didn't know him, 
and he didn't know me, and that was tough. I was very unhappy for a long time. 
You wonder, 'Who is this person?' " 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Malathi received support from her husband's brother and sister, 
who lived in America. She took classes at Cal State Northridge. She became a 
free-lance artist. She fell in love with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make it work, and so we did," Malathi said. "When you are not open 
to the idea of separating, as in our culture, it makes you look at things in a 
different way. The relationship is solid. You don't just run away." 
</P>
<P>
A similar dedication to the institution of marriage is shared by Iraqi men and 
women who were set up by their families. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are problems, you have to solve them," said Manier Isho, of North 
Hollywood, who emigrated from Iraq in 1981; his nephew and brother returned to 
their homeland to find wives selected by their families. "The family will even 
get involved if necessary. Divorce does not happen." 
</P>
<P>
As such, a heavy premium is placed by families on finding a spouse with good 
moral character. Falling in love isn't as important as finding stability. 
Parents often seek to set their children, especially daughters, up with someone 
with a proven work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Matti Moosa, a professor of history at Gannon University in Erie, Pa., said 
the tradition of arranged marriages in Iraq, as in India, is declining because 
of advances in education and Western influences. "But because many feel Western 
culture is decadent, they still want their children married the old way." 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you get married, the love by itself isn't enough," said Walid 
Dinkha, of North Hollywood, who met his wife in July, 1982; they were married 
five months later. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, when her parents proposed the marriage, Dinkha's wife, Lucy, 
declined. She was in love with someone else. But the other man fell in love 
with another woman, and Lucy was alone. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I found out, that's when I told the family it would be OK to arrange 
things," Lucy said. 
</P>
<P>
They brought her Walid's photo. She was impressed. They spoke on the phone 
constantly. Finally, a few months later, they met in person. 
</P>
<P>
"When we met, I felt like I had known him for years," she said. "I knew things 
would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
And while, as Malathi said, life with a new man in America wasn't easy at 
first, Lucy survived and is now happy. 
</P>
<P>
They have three young boys. Will they arrange the marriages of their kids? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they'll get married that way," Lucy said. "It will be very hard 
to do that in the United States. Not these days."

LEARNING THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY; 
</P>
<P>
CLASSES: THOUSANDS OF YOUNGSTERS SPEND HALF-DAYS ON SATURDAYS LEARNING THE 
CUSTOMS IN COUNTRIES THAT THEIR FAMILIES HAVE LEFT BEHIND.

Ten-year-old Albert Kuo would rather spend Saturday mornings watching cartoons 
or flying his kite with friends from Serrania Avenue Elementary School in 
Woodland Hills. Instead, he is drawing Chinese characters, speaking Mandarin 
and perfecting a mean game of Ping-Pong at the Chinese School held at James 
Monroe High School in Sepulveda, where he is known as Kuo Chun-Yu. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of thousands of youngsters in the San Fernando Valley who take part 
in half-day Saturday classes that teach the customs in countries that their 
families have left behind. 
</P>
<P>
On any given Saturday, students might be preparing for the Chinese dragon boat 
festival, celebrating the Korean New Year of Sulnal, making meals for a Jewish 
Seder or folding paper for Japanese origami. These nonprofit classes meet on 
public school campuses and focus on language, history, dance and the art of 
ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
Programs are as diverse as the Valley populace. Social clubs and ethnic 
churches offer information about classes for children who are African, 
Armenian, Dutch, Filipino, French, Greek, Hebrew, Iranian, Irish, Nicaraguan, 
Palestinian, Russian, Salvadoran, Thai, Vietnamese and many others. Classes 
cost $5 to $10 each day. 
</P>
<P>
"This keeps some kind of cultural identity so our heritage is not lost," said 
Sue W. Fan, principal for the 240 children who attend the Chinese School 
sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Chinese Cultural Assn. in Northridge. "It 
gives a better self-image to know their origin." 
</P>
<P>
Young children often rebel against a sixth day of school, which requires a good 
share of homework. Even Fan's two children complain about Chinese School. She 
reminds them that in China or Taiwan they would be required to go to a sixth 
day of school. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes my mom happy, but I'd like to be out with my friends playing video 
games," said Fan's son, Kevin, 9. 
</P>
<P>
So teachers try to make the cultural classes fun with crafts, contests, 
performances and sports. Some students get credit for high school language 
classes by coming to Saturday schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think 'what a dud' when I first came here, but now it's typically 
weird because I want to learn more," said Luice Hwang, 16, who grew up as a 
Valley girl but who, unlike most of her classmates at Van Nuys High School, can 
speak and write Chinese. "I know one of the most difficult languages in the 
world. I can't wait to go to Taiwan someday." 
</P>
<P>
The classes also help Hwang understand her parents' strict moral upbringing. 
"Like when they give me a curfew or say that I can't have a boyfriend until I'm 
78," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes good communication with parents because so many times parents don't 
speak so good English," said In-Sook Cho, principal of the Korean Institute of 
Southern California, which has 160 students at Parkman Junior High School each 
Saturday in Woodland Hills. "We have two handicaps with our children -- 
different generation and different culture -- and these classes help make an 
understanding from both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Cho's school offers specialties such as tae kwon do, abacus and Korean 
traditional dance. Girls in the dance classes wear long dresses -- called 
han-bok -- in pink, yellow, green and blue silk with gold lace. 
</P>
<P>
After practicing the fan dance with two pink feathered fans and the silk dress 
her grandmother made in Korea, Jeannie Kim, 11, explained how the dance uses 
traditional Korean steps. 
</P>
<P>
"The music doesn't have much of a beat," Kim said about the steady droning of 
Korean music. "I'd much rather be listening to Bobby Brown, the New Kids on the 
Block or Milli Vanilli." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers' salaries barely cover gas money at the Korean School, Cho said, but 
the educators command respect that teachers in public schools might not get. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect and good attitude make a good student," said Cho, who added that 
students in Korea are told not to step on a teacher's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Parkman Junior High School Principal Andrew Anderson welcomes schools such as 
the Korean Institute to his campus. His school enrollment is only 14% Asian, 
but he knows that many academic awards at the end of the year will go to that 
community because of its intense ethnic training. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no more ability than any other student, they just enjoy learning," 
Anderson said. "Sometimes they grumble about spending four hours Saturday 
morning in school, but it is good to preserve traditions. And, it is good for 
the whole community because we all learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
Students rarely learn about their culture in school, said Principal Gabriel 
Injejikian, whose Ferrahian High School in Encino is one of five Armenian 
schools between Canoga Park and Glendale that offer after-school language 
classes. "Armenian is just not taught very much in public school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Learning a different language -- even if read backward or up and down -- helps 
children learn more languages if they want to do so, said Nili Ziv of Valley 
Beth Shalom, a Hebrew school in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"These are Americans who want to transmit to their children their history and 
it makes the children more open and tolerant of other cultures," Ziv said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley Japanese Language Institute in Pacoima, probably the 
Valley's oldest part-time ethnic school, has been operating 65 years. Most of 
the 120 children who attend the classes at the Japanese American Community 
Center have parents who were born in Japan, institute President Nobuko 
Jonokuchi said. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach reigi, polite discipline, and try to encourage students to 
concentrate on math and science," Jonokuchi said. "Children who know Japanese 
can ask their parents for help in their public school homework, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday schools offer immediate practical applications, such as a recent 
computer class demonstrating software using Chinese characters, Chinese 
Cultural Assn. President Steve Yang said. His school also teaches kung fu and 
flute, and reminds families of traditions such as dabbing rice wine to the 
forehead of children to ward off bad luck and eating a tamale-like dish with 
rice wrapped in bamboo leaves. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the time, the classes have simpler applications. 
</P>
<P>
"These schools are nice because now my children can write to their 
grandparents," Yang said.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: AVANT-GARDE WILL FIND ITS PLACE IN THE 
SUN AT ELARIO'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a radical departure from the status quo, Elario's will play host to a 
one-night visit by jazz space cadet Sun Ra and his 15-piece Arkestra next 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance by an avant-garde jazz artist is the first shake-up by San Diego 
Jazz Festival founder Rob Hagey since he took over as talent coordinator last 
month, replacing Steve Satkowski. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hagey who first brought Sun Ra to San Diego, for a sold-out show at the 
Old Globe Theatre's Festival Stage in 1980. This time around, Ra will tame his 
act in deference to the slightly more conservative surroundings, playing a 
tribute to Big Band leaders Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Hagey acknowledges that the progressive show is an experiment; he said he needs 
to sell 150 tickets between the two shows to break even. Shows are at 8:30 and 
10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Ra, whose real name is Herman (Sonny) Blount, was weaned on traditional jazz in 
Chicago, played with Henderson's band, and arranged Big Band charts for 
Henderson and Benny Goodman. He started his Arkestra in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Today his band's collective improvising isn't so shocking, but it turned a few 
heads in the early days as probably the first Big Band to depart from 
traditional structures. 
</P>
<P>
There is some degree of mystery surrounding Mr. Ra, if we can call him that. He 
claims to have arrived from Saturn, and has no legal birth certificate. He is 
purported to be in his late 70s, and lives in Philadelphia. The Arkestra's most 
recent album is last year's "Blue Delight." 
</P>
<P>
Rusefest '90, which brought a rare dose of experimental jazz to town this 
spring, including a performance by the Bay Area-based Rova Saxophone Quartet, 
closes Friday night with a concert by pianist Joe Garrison with the Ruse Brass 
Ensemble and featured soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The group will dish up new music by Garrison, who has titled this suite "My 
Brothers, My Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
"My point of departure was, I'm really tired of musicians using music as a way 
to justify their lives," Garrison said. 'I want to take care of my life. I want 
my life to work. It used to be enough to worship music. A lot of musicians do 
that, and they hurt a lot of people in the process. They hurt their families; 
they don't care enough about other people; they put music above everything. I'm 
trying to join the human race, put people first. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I was thinking about while I wrote. I also noticed I was letting 
go of my iron grip on the compositions and thinking of the strength of the 
players. Some of these pieces will only work because of the specific 
musicians." 
</P>
<P>
Among Garrison's band mates for this date will be trombonists Louis Watkins, 
Will Martin and Jeff Bernard and trumpeters Derrick Cannon and Bill Caballero. 
Featured soloists will include Frank Lamarca on tenor sax, David Millard on 
soprano, Turiya on bass clarinet and flute, plus Caballero. Several of the 
players, including Garrison, are also members of Turiya's Immediate Freedom 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison said the music is designed specifically for this Big Band lineup, but 
with a more abstract approach than is typical of Big Band charts. Some of the 
music is quite formal in structure, some virtually free-form, according to 
Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
You'll hear traces of Latin in the music, but nothing like what Garrison and 
the Immediate Freedom Band produce; this band doesn't have a percussion 
section. 
</P>
<P>
The music starts at 8 p.m. in the San Diego City College Theatre on C Street 
between 13th and 15th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboard player and studio wiz Spencer Nilsen, whose debut album, "Architects 
of Change," enjoyed moderate success last year on light jazz and new age radio 
stations, is ready to perform live for the first time. Nilsen will mix tunes 
from the album with new compositions next Wednesday night in the Catamaran's 
Cannibal Bar in Mission Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Nilsen said his post-album compositions are heading in a new direction. In 
addition to playing keyboards, he's been singing, and he hopes to reach a 
broader audience with a sound he calls "global pop," influenced by artists such 
as Sting and Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the live act is trumpeter and wind synthesizer player Mitch Manker, 
who has backed Ray Charles. Manker uses the synthesizer to duplicate lead 
melodies produced on Nilsen's album by a variety of instruments, including 
violin. Rounding out the group are Brad Kaiser on drums, Dave Curtis on bass 
guitar and former Flight 7 guitarist Mark Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
For next Wednesday's performance, Nilsen has sculpted a tight 90-minute show 
that includes new material and seven songs from his album. He'll play it twice, 
at 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Sunday's show at UC San Diego featuring Cecil Lytle and Sonny Rollins 
has been canceled. . . . Next Tuesday, trombonist Rocky Cole puts a sextet 
through its paces for KSDS-FM's (88.3) "Jazz Live" concert at the City College 
Theatre, with a live broadcast on the station. . . . Trumpeter Bill Caballero 
unveiled his new seven-piece tropical and Latin band, Quien Sabe, last Friday 
night at a downtown dance studio. Caballero is a Texas transplant whose recent 
San Diego work has included frequent appearances with Turiya and her Immediate 
Freedom Band. . . . Today and tomorrow, pianist Mike Wofford holds down the 
lunchtime solo piano at Cafe Lautrec in La Jolla from noon to 3:30. Wofford 
also plays the new Hyatt Regency in La Jolla from 5 to 7:30 p.m. Monday. . . . 
Friday and Saturday nights, flutist Lori Bell and pianist Dave Mackay hit the 
Horton Grand Hotel's Palace Bar downtown. . . . With the success of his first 
two "Innovation in Modern Music" concerts at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach, 
jazz promoter Bob Geib hopes to continue the jazz revival at the club with such 
names as trombonist Mike Fahn, Freddie Hubbard sideman Bob Sheppard, former 
Count Basie trumpeter Oscar Brashear, Harold Land Jr. and Key Akagi, a 
keyboardist who's worked with Miles Davis. . . . Art Johnson, master of 
seven-string jazz guitar, plays Words &amp; Music Bookstore in Hillcrest this 
Sunday at 3 p.m., with Gary Scott on flute and sax and Jim Plank on drums.

SCHOOL TAX ON LOTS FACES A STIFF FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS: MOST RESIDENTS DON'T HAVE SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN, AND OF THOSE WHO 
DO, MANY ARE INELIGIBLE TO VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Selling a tax increase to voters is an uphill struggle anywhere. Beverly Hills 
school officials and their allies may find their own hill especially steep as 
they try to persuade the city's voters to support a parcel tax next month 
designed to bail the school district out of its financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel tax initiative, Proposition B on the June 5 ballot, must be approved 
by two-thirds of the voters to take effect. The five-year tax would raise about 
$4.5 million a year for the schools, or about $22.5 million in all, through 
assessments on each of the 9,472 residential and commercial parcels of land in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Parcels would be taxed each year on a sliding scale ranging from $250 for 
condominiums to $750 for commercial plots larger than 10,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting the tax is a broad coalition of school officials, teachers, parents 
and city officials. They say the tax is necessary to maintain the quality of 
education in the Beverly Hills Unified School District and, indirectly, the 
property values and the city's image. A low-key group of opponents is 
fashioning a platform of tax revolt and back-to-basics in education. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent popularity of their cause, supporters of the tax know the 
odds are not in their favor. Statewide, of the 80 school district parcel tax 
elections held from 1983 through last November, only 30 have passed. (One 
district that has approved them is the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School 
District, where voters have twice approved a $58-a-parcel tax.) 
</P>
<P>
Among the failures was Beverly Hills' last parcel tax attempt, in March, 1987. 
In that election, the proposed tax was favored by 59% of the voters -- but was 
well short of the two-thirds needed for passage. A criticism of that tax 
measure was that since it proposed a flat fee of $270 on every parcel, small 
plots would be taxed the same amount as sprawling estates. The variable rate 
this time around will eliminate such inequities, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
But there remain some special circumstances in Beverly Hills that make it 
particularly difficult to push a school tax increase through. Consider that: 
</P>
<P>
* Beverly Hills contains an unusually high percentage of residents with no 
current ties to the public schools. School district spokeswoman Hali Wickner 
gives a rough estimate that less than one-fifth of Beverly Hills residents have 
school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
* Meanwhile, as a result of the influx of immigrants in recent years 
(particularly from Iran), an unusually high percentage of parents with 
school-age children are ineligible to vote because they are not U.S. citizens. 
Sherman Kulick, a leader of the campaign against the tax, estimates that 40% of 
the parents of the district's students are not eligible. 
</P>
<P>
* Teachers, who in most school districts could be counted on for a significant 
pro-tax bloc of votes, are mostly on the sidelines in Beverly Hills, because 
few teachers can afford to live in the city. Judy McIntire, president of the 
teachers union, the Beverly Hills Education Assn., estimates that just 12% of 
the district's 300 teachers, nurses, counselors and librarians live in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
If the tax passes, teachers will receive an additional 3% pay increase for the 
1990-91 school year, on top of a 7% raise already provided in the settlement 
reached after the teachers' 13-day strike last fall. 
</P>
<P>
If the tax is rejected, a lot more than the 3% raise is at stake. Union and 
district officials say it will be necessary to lay off 48 teachers, counselors, 
librarians and nurses. All told, the district will have to cut $3.2 million in 
spending to balance the projected $30-million budget for 1990-91. Among the 
casualties will be elementary music teachers, elementary computer and science 
lab specialists and the Academic Decathlon coach. Two nurses will also be cut, 
leaving only one for the entire 4,700-student district. 
</P>
<P>
Although it serves a city of extraordinary wealth, the Beverly Hills school 
district has had chronic money problems in recent years. As a result of a 1976 
state Supreme Court decision, the state allocates money for public schools 
based on enrollment rather than on the amount of property taxes a community 
generates. Declining enrollment has brought further cuts in state funding, and 
Proposition 13 and other laws require any additional local taxes for schools to 
be approved in a referendum by two-thirds of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these restrictions, the Beverly Hills school district still manages to 
spend more money per student than any other unified school system in Los 
Angeles County. The district receives a substantial direct subsidy from the 
city of Beverly Hills -- $4.6 million this year. It gets about $350,000 a year 
from a nonprofit fund-raising foundation and sells clothing emblazoned with the 
logo of its famed high school. 
</P>
<P>
McIntire, the teachers union president, said one high-school teacher has 
already accepted a position in another district for next year, and others are 
looking, rather than face the uncertainty of the election. "You can't wait 
(until after the tax election), because the majority of the best jobs (in other 
districts) will be taken," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While non-resident teachers cannot vote, they are not sitting out the campaign. 
About 100 teachers have pledged to work for passage of the tax, McIntire said. 
This weekend, for example, teachers will join parents, residents and other 
members of the Yes on Schools Committee in distributing flyers door to door. In 
addition, the teachers union has contributed $4,000 to the campaign chest and 
its parent organization, the California Teachers Assn., has given $8,000, 
McIntire said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax also has the support of the City Council, the Chamber of Commerce and a 
student committee at Beverly Hills High School, which is registering 
18-year-olds to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Yes on Schools Committee, which launched its campaign with a rally last 
Sunday, plans a vigorous, high-budget effort to try to sell the tax to voters. 
"If we can raise $75,000, $100,000, we'll raise it, and not apologize for doing 
so," said committee co-chairman Bernard Nebenzahl. "We don't feel that's vulgar 
or obscene. . . . This is not a campaign of silence. We have to get 
(two-thirds) of the vote." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the tax have formed the Beverly Hills Citizens for Cost-Effective 
Quality Education. They say they will only spend $500 and will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fool the public. You're asking the public to tax themselves on a 
nebulous record," said group chairman Kulick, adding that his organization has 
more than 200 supporters. "It's a tax revolt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kulick, who was a leader of the anti-tax drive in 1987, contends that the 
district is not spending its money wisely. San Marino, La Canada, Palos Verdes 
Peninsula and other school districts in wealthy communities spend less money 
per student, yet their scores on statewide tests are just as high as in Beverly 
Hills, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Money does not buy an education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The expenditures of Beverly Hills schools are "way out of line," he added. "We 
don't trust people who are in government to be responsible for spending within 
their means. If you give them $2, they'll spend $3," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-tax campaign leader Nebenzahl disagreed. "The parcel tax is not about 
throwing money at the district," he said, "it's about retaining programs. We're 
not adding to the budget." 
</P>
<P>
Nebenzahl acknowledged that some other affluent districts spend less per pupil 
and produce test scores as good or better than in Beverly Hills, but the more 
diversified programs offered by Beverly Hills -- including Advanced Placement 
drama, art and computer programs -- mean that it is offering education "for the 
total person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "What we don't want to have is our district homogenized to be the 
same as all other districts." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in 1987, the district has no reserves to fall back on, he said. "The 
district is in fact out of money." 
</P>
<P>
Kulick scoffed at the need for computer, music and other specialist 
instructors. "Education has to do with the basics, not the frill courses," he 
said. "You shouldn't have to learn math on a computer. We had to do all the 
adding in our head, by hand -- that's the essence of learning." 
</P>
<P>
The district, he said, is crying wolf. "They told us the school district would 
go to hell" if the tax lost in 1987, Kulick said. "The school district didn't 
get destroyed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background 
</P>
<P>
The proposed parcel tax grew out of an acrimonious 13-day teachers strike last 
fall, which was settled only after a group of frustrated parents intervened. 
They persuaded the teachers union and the district officials to return to the 
bargaining table, pledged to raise up to $600,000 to go to employee salaries 
and benefits and helped hammer out a contract containing a two-year, 12% pay 
increase. As part of the deal, all parties to the settlement also agreed to 
support a parcel tax, on the understanding that if it passed, some of the 
revenue would be used to add 3% to the teachers' salary schedule in 1990-91.

FINES SET FOR FAILING TO SAVE WATER; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: THOSE RESIDENTS WHO DON'T REPLACE WATER-GUZZLING PLUMBING WITH 
LOW-FLOW FIXTURES FACE A PENALTY OF $1 A MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica residents soon will have a new incentive to conserve water: 
They'll be charged a monthly fine if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
On a 5-2 vote, the City Council Tuesday night approved the fines -- or 
"conservation incentive fees," as city officials prefer to call them -- as part 
of its five-year, $2.9-million program to conserve water by replacing 
water-guzzling plumbing fixtures with low-flow fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
State water officials said they believe the law, which takes effect July 1, 
would make Santa Monica the first California city to require the installation 
of water-saving fixtures in existing residences. 
</P>
<P>
The law calls for residents and landlords to replace old toilets with new ones 
that use a maximum of 1.6 gallons per flush, and to install shower heads that 
limit flow to 3 gallons or less per minute. 
</P>
<P>
After July 1, owners of single-family residences who have not complied will 
have $1 a month added to their water bills, and owners of multifamily buildings 
will be charged 65 cents each month per unit. Commercial properties are not 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
All residents will be charged the fine through their water bill until the new 
fixtures are inspected and verified by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Low-flow toilets cost from $99 to $250, according to city officials. They 
estimate that single-family homeowners can recoup their costs through lower 
water bills in 9 1/2 to 21 months, depending on whether they install the 
fixtures themselves or hire a plumber. For apartment owners, the pay-back 
period ranges from 11 months to two years. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica already requires low-flow toilets and shower heads in all new 
construction. Similar laws are in effect in Los Angeles and many other 
California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and several other cities also require retrofitting of existing 
homes whenever they are sold. But a spokesman at the State Department of Water 
Resources' drought center said Santa Monica's new monthly charge on existing 
residences was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage residents to retrofit, Santa Monica is giving away 1,000 new 
toilets to residents on a first-come, first-served basis. Cash rebates of $100 
per bathroom will also be given to residents who retrofit. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's conservation coordinator, Atossa Soltani, said about 1,300 new 
toilets have been installed so far in the city. About 700 of the free toilets 
and about $41,000 in rebates have been distributed so far to property owners. 
</P>
<P>
The city has set a goal of retrofitting 25% of the city's 11,400 single-family 
homes and 36,500 units of multifamily housing within the next five years. If 
that goal is reached, at the end of the five years about 936 acre-feet of water 
could be saved annually, or about 835,200 gallons per day. 
</P>
<P>
But so far the city is behind schedule. To achieve its goal, about 4,000 
toilets would have to be installed each year, according to Soltani. At the 
current rate, less than 3,000 new toilets would be installed by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Metropolitan Water District estimates, 45% of all water used in a 
household is flushed down toilets. About 30% of the water is used for bathing.

A CONGREGATION IN SHOCK; 
</P>
<P>
VENICE: MEMBERS OF PACIFIC JEWISH CENTER LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER, AND LIVE IN 
RELATIVE PEACE. THE BRUTAL SLAYING OF A CONGREGANT HAS SHATTERED THAT PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the second to last night of her life, after a festive Sabbath dinner, 
Stephanie Bernstein was escorted on the mile walk back to her Venice apartment 
by a fellow member of the Pacific Jewish Center congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Such escorts are a way of life in the close-knit community, because of its 
members' observance of the Jewish tradition of walking everywhere during the 
Sabbath, and because of the danger in the sometimes-seedy area of the Venice 
Beach boardwalk where the congregation lives and worships. 
</P>
<P>
For 13 years, hundreds of center congregants have lived a laid-back yet 
traditionally observant Jewish life among the eclectic characters of the 
boardwalk. The mostly younger couples and singles who belong to the center 
watch out for one another and have lived in relative peace. 
</P>
<P>
But last week that peace was shattered. The somewhat insular and religious 
community came face-to-face with the sometimes violent world around them on 
April 23 when Bernstein was brutally slain in her apartment, allegedly by a 
recently paroled rapist. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been pretty lucky up until now," said Meyer Denn, executive director 
of the center. "But now we have been touched by it too." 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old writer and editor was stabbed and beaten to death, and may have 
been raped, by an intruder in her 3rd Avenue apartment just off Rose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they caught Kermis Taffy Thompson Jr., 29, of Venice at Bernstein's 
apartment. He has been charged with murder, rape, robbery and burglary. 
Thompson, convicted in 1980 of raping and robbing a Los Angeles woman in her 
apartment, was released from prison just 10 weeks ago. He could face the death 
penalty, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack has shocked and outraged the 500 or so members of the congregation 
and has scared many into taking extra precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been devastated," Denn said. "We are like a big family and to have 
someone wrenched out from among us, and the way it was done, makes it very 
difficult for us to understand." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the community's single women have moved in with friends and family, 
including Allison Gordon, a close friend of Bernstein who lives close by. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise," Gordon said, "I wouldn't be able to sleep. When something like 
this happens, as a woman, it focuses you on how vulnerable you are." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the soul-searching by members of the center, there has been a 
strengthening of their resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the congregation members moved to the area around Rose Avenue so 
they could be within walking distance of other community members and the 
center's synagogue, formerly the Bay Cities Synagogue on Ocean Front Walk 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
They were drawn to the center's philosophy of nurturing a communal lifestyle 
steeped in the traditions of Judaism, a lifestyle described by congregants as a 
tranquil oasis amid the chaos of urban life. 
</P>
<P>
Those attractions were not changed by Bernstein's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say this very emphatically for everyone living here; we are not going 
anywhere," said writer Michael Medved, the center's president. "This is not 
going to deflect us from our purpose of building a very dynamic center of 
Jewish life in this corner of California." 
</P>
<P>
Added Rabbi Daniel Lapin, who founded the center with Medved 13 years ago: 
"People here assist each other at all levels, based on the desire to create an 
oasis of communal tranquility. . . . We have been outraged. But you can't run 
from this sort of thing. There is a determination not to yield." 
</P>
<P>
Center leaders and congregants describe the community as a very special place, 
a return to the Old World notion of a community in which they do more than 
worship together. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows and helps one another. Meals, particularly the Friday and 
Saturday Sabbath meals, are festive occasions in which a dozen or so members 
spend a few hours chatting about the week's events. Married members look to fix 
up singles with mates. Members pitch in to make newcomers feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
When a woman gives birth, others cook the meals for her family for two weeks. 
Members pitch in financially when others need help. The center itself sponsors 
seminars and teaches classes on a number of issues pertaining to history and 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
Medved said it was that spirit of community, along with its emphasis on Jewish 
traditions and values, that brought Bernstein and her former husband to the 
community. Medved invited them for a holiday meal four years ago and they moved 
to a house near the synagogue four months later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Stephanie isn't somebody who just happened to find herself in Venice," Medved 
said. "She, like virtually everybody else . . . moved here to be a part of this 
experiment in living Judaism." 
</P>
<P>
At a memorial ceremony last Thursday night, Bernstein was eulogized as a 
caring, loving person, "without a mean bone in her body," who would often stop 
to give a homeless person a blanket or money. Her contributions to the center 
were noted, including her anonymous donations to help needy congregants, and 
the hours she spent volunteering at the center's school. 
</P>
<P>
"Stephanie was drawn to this neighborhood and our organization because she 
exemplified it that much," Medved said. "In the best, most open tradition 
spirit of the Jewish tradition, she found valuable and beautiful things in 
every corner of society." 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service was held Sunday for Bernstein in her parent's hometown of 
Scarsdale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, who dropped her married name of Corey after her divorce, had not 
been all that religious until several years ago. But since moving into the 
community, she kept kosher, walked everywhere during the Sabbath and began 
learning more about Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
She recently had become concerned with reports of violence in the area, and the 
occasional eruptions of gunfire, according to Paula Bernstein, an in-law and 
friend, and had thought about moving from the area since her divorce a year 
ago. The two had even discussed the subject on the day Bernstein died. 
</P>
<P>
But she wanted to stay within walking distance of the synagogue and the school, 
said her friend. 
</P>
<P>
"She felt that she didn't want to leave the community. The support was very 
important to her," said Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
Medved and Lapin founded the center after finding that the once-thriving Jewish 
community by the beach had been reduced almost to a handful of old men, and 
that many younger Jews were new to the area and without a community to call 
home, they said. 
</P>
<P>
They set out to build a community, family by family, in the hopes of creating a 
haven that would encourage Jews to return to their roots, or to find the 
religious roots many of them had never known. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, more than 125 families have moved in to the community, and 
there have been about 85 weddings and 160 children born, Denn said. Along the 
way, the center has built a school that mixes American history and Judaism with 
lessons in Hebrew, English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The school, with its whitewashed buildings and playgrounds surrounded by a 
heavy security fence, plans to expand each year until it incorporates children 
from kindergarten to 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
Because Bernstein spent a lot of time at the school and with the children, a 
trust fund in her name has been established there to provide books at the 
school and to encourage the youngsters to engage in creative writing. 
</P>
<P>
Congregants are quick to explain that the community is neither overly insular 
or religious. Rather, it is a place to study Judaism away from cloistered and 
rigid confines. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have the tendency to view religiously committed people as 
exclusive, isolated and withdrawn from the world," Medved said. "But PJC has 
always stood for the opposite; that the more religious you are the more 
involved you should be with the world around you, and the more connected." 
</P>
<P>
Center officials say the area around the center is no more dangerous than any 
other urban area and see Bernstein's brutal murder as an isolated incident. 
Congregation members and Los Angeles Police Department officials said Thompson 
should have been in custody at the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 200-pound ex-convict, who has pleaded innocent to the current 
charges, had been detained by police nearly a month ago in a gang raid at a 
Culver City motel. Police arrested Thompson and others on suspicion of 
conspiracy to commit murder, but he was released when the district attorney's 
office declined to prosecute, Sgt. Alan Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said members of LAPD's anti-gang unit thought Thompson's association 
with the gang members was a violation of his parole. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (Thompson) screwed up, and that there were grounds to revoke his 
parole," Thatcher said. State parole officials, however, said Thompson had not 
violated conditions of his parole. 
</P>
<P>
Police had questioned Thompson just 20 minutes before Bernstein's slaying, as 
he and another man stood on a street corner, but determined that he was doing 
nothing illegal. The same officer who questioned Thompson arrested him less 
than half an hour later, as Thompson came out of Bernstein's bedroom covered 
with blood and brandishing an iron bar, according to Lt. Ross Moen, commanding 
officer of detectives in LAPD's Pacific Division.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
LUNCHES TO COST 10 MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lunch at Culver City elementary schools will cost a dime more next year. 
</P>
<P>
The price increase, approved Tuesday by the Culver City Board of Education, 
will help offset losses in the cafeteria due to increased costs for salaries 
and food. 
</P>
<P>
Because of cutbacks in government surplus cheese and other items, food costs 
have gone up almost 20% this year and are expected to rise at least another 10% 
next year, according to the district. 
</P>
<P>
The school cafeterias this year will show a total loss of $35,000 to $40,000, 
according to the district's food service department. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary school lunches, which have cost $1.25 for two years, will be $1.35. 
In addition, profit-making food items such as pizza, French fries, nachos, 
cookies and diet fruit sodas will be sold a la carte at Culver City middle and 
high schools, a food service report stated. Samples of possible a la carte 
offerings will be given to students to determine which are most popular, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Middle and high school lunches will remain at $1.75.

YAROSLAVSKY IN MOSCOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is in the Soviet Union this week to 
meet with government officials, Jewish leaders and representatives of the U.S. 
Embassy, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky will be in Moscow until Sunday at the invitation of Dr. Mikhail 
Chlenov, president of Vaad, an association of 210 Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The Westside councilman's office said the trip was prompted by concerns raised 
when Pamyat, a right-wing nationalistic Soviet organization, urged that 
organized acts of violence be committed Saturday against Jews in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky is accompanied by Si Frumkin, chairman of the Southern California 
Council for Soviet Jews, which is paying for Yaroslavsky's trip, Yaroslavsky 
spokeswoman Katharine Macdonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Before his election to the City Council in 1975, Yaroslavsky served as 
executive director of the group, Macdonald said.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: NORTH CENTRAL ANAHEIM: FOCUS; 
</P>
<P>
AN AFFORDABLE DISTRICT FOR RAISING A FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALLAS M. JACKSON , Clipboard researched by Elena Brunet, Dallas M. Jackson 
and Janice L. Jones / Los Angeles; Times Graphics by Doris Shields / Los 
Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are a lot of unfortunate stereotypes that can be applied to a 
neighborhood whose per-capita income is $9,000 yearly: peeling paint, cars 
parked on lawns, weed-ridden yards and frustrated social and personal 
commentary documented in spray paint on walls, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
However, this Anaheim neighborhood's assets lie not in its Dun &amp; Bradstreet 
but in its sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the kind of neighborhood where we are always running in and out of 
each other's back door," says resident Lucille Gray, 32, "but we visit when 
we're out doing yard work -- we know who's who, and we watch out for each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
And they do. Neighborhood Watch signs are planted every few blocks, warning 
intruders to beware. Youngsters are rarely seen alone and are almost always 
accompanied by mom, dad, an older brother or sister, or in small, safe groups 
with their peers. 
</P>
<P>
Western Medical Center lends aid to its neighbors with blood pressure, glucose 
and cholesterol screenings, as well as at-cost mammograms, tours and community 
lectures. 
</P>
<P>
Even Uncle Sam watches out for the neighborhood. Because of the large number of 
low- to moderate-income residents, the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development has designated the district a target area and has made money 
available for neighborhood improvements through the Community Development Block 
Grant (CDBG) program. 
</P>
<P>
According to Linda Ureno, community development coordinator for the city of 
Anaheim, which administers the program, the neighborhood received $308,500 this 
year and has been allocated $320,000 by HUD for the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"The neat thing about the whole CDBG program is that it is 
grass-roots-dominated," Ureno says. "Citizens identify projects and follow them 
all the way through. We have an extensive citizen-participation program that 
calls for the formation of neighborhood councils," in this case the Citron 
Neighborhood Council. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Botich, chairwoman of the neighborhood council, says it holds regular 
meetings for residents to put together wish lists. This enables the Anaheim 
City Council to get requests for street lights, storm drains and new sidewalks 
and move on them without modification or delay. Upcoming ventures include an 
alley revitalization in which inoperative vehicles will be removed, potholes 
will be repaired, graffiti will be removed and an entire alley spruced up. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a good program," she says. "But we need more people from this 
particular neighborhood to attend meetings. We've got a big push on now, with 
flyers and mailing lists to get as many (people) as possible to our June 7 
meeting. If they have a pet project that would benefit the neighborhood, they 
need to bring it to the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
One such project is a bookmobile. "It is difficult to break the poverty cycle 
unless you learn to read and do well in school," Ureno says. "When the 
neighborhood asked for money for the bookmobile, CDBG gave $30,000 for 
bilingual materials, new books, cellular phones -- whatever they needed to make 
their life easier and reach those pockets (of people) that might not otherwise 
get to the library." 
</P>
<P>
The bookmobile program was such a rousing success that last summer more than 
500 neighborhood children participated in the summer reading program. 
</P>
<P>
Through the block grant program, qualified residents can get low-interest loans 
for home improvements -- new roofing, landscaping, tree removal, paint, room 
additions -- or rebates if the improvements have already been made and can be 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
Those development programs may be one of the reasons homes look so well kept. 
It is a familiar sight on any given block to see lawns in transition, hazardous 
trees being removed, new roofs being installed or homes being given a fresh 
coat of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Still, another reason homes are so well maintained is simple pride of 
ownership. Homes such as that of Lucille and William Gray are a good example. 
Brightly colored flowers frame impeccably manicured shrubs and lawns. But for 
the moment, the Grays' lawn is completely brown -- they killed it so the family 
could put in a new, drought-resistant yard. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep pride in their homes," Lucille Gray says. "We're not fancy, but we 
try to keep it up. We're typical. A lot of us are older and retired, but we've 
stayed. A few have lost spouses but still live here." 
</P>
<P>
But three blocks over is Juan Garcia. He and his family rent a modest home in 
the neighborhood and are relative newcomers. They are part of the growing 
dichotomy between older, retired, established residents and younger families 
with young children looking to buy that first home. Garcia was attracted by the 
prospect of an affordable, comfortable, safe place to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved here from Santa Ana five years ago," Garcia says with a smile, as his 
three small children tackle him in the front yard of their home. "We like it. 
This is a nice neighborhood."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 59; 
</P>
<P>
CONTEST ON EASTSIDE SHAPES UP AS TEST OF LATINO POLITICAL CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Eastside Assembly race to succeed Charles M. Calderon has turned into a 
high-stakes turf battle marked by an unusual split among local Latino political 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, fresh from an easy win in a special state Senate election in the San 
Gabriel Valley, is backing a longtime aide to fill his seat in the Assembly. A 
victory by the aide, Marta Maestas, probably would boost Calderon's prestige 
and demonstrate his power within the Latino political community. 
</P>
<P>
But Maestas, 47, first must defeat four Democratic opponents -- three of whom 
have their own powerful allies -- in the June 5 Democratic primary for the 59th 
Assembly District. The would-be kingmakers include two congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
One of those contenders for the Assembly seat is Diane Martinez, 37, a member 
of the Garvey school board in Rosemead whose candidacy is being touted by her 
father, Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Montebello). Rep. Martinez has been busy 
raising campaign money for his daughter and introducing her to potential 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outflanked, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) has thrown his 
weight behind a former aide, Xavier Becerra, 32, a deputy attorney general. 
Several Torres staffers have taken time off from their taxpayer-paid jobs to 
help Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) is stumping for longtime ally Bill 
Hernandez, 41, a member of the Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees. 
Said Torres: "I will be raising money, walking precincts, speaking at events on 
his behalf." 
</P>
<P>
The ethnically diverse district in the shadow of the San Gabriel Mountains 
includes Alhambra, Monterey Park, Montebello, Pico Rivera, South El Monte and 
part of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
A string of bruising Democratic primary battles have been fought in the area -- 
dating back to 1978 when then-Assemblyman Joseph B. Montoya unseated Sen. 
Alfred H. Song. But the race to succeed Calderon stands out because of the 
four-way split within the Latino political establishment, which often has 
presented a more united front in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Torres dismissed suggestions that the current Assembly campaign represents 
a power struggle among factions. Instead, he described the contest as "a very 
healthy situation. . . . People in that district have a lot of options." 
</P>
<P>
And Calderon said the race demonstrates that Latinos are "no different than any 
other community." An open legislative seat creates intense political interest 
and attracts candidates who "tend to have had some connection with the 
political process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, several campaign consultants said the election should help sort 
out who has clout among Latino politicians. In particular, they said, the man 
behind the winner could emerge with momentum for another election. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Rep. Torres has been considered a potential candidate for the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors, especially if a pending federal lawsuit 
results in a district in which a majority of voters are Latino. Sen. Torres 
also has been often mentioned as a likely candidate for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth Democratic hopeful in the 59th Assembly District race, Larry Salazar, 
33, is the only one without a well-known second in his corner. "I'm right where 
I want to be. There are no strings being pulled," boasted Salazar, a Montebello 
marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the politicians pushing their own candidates in the race are 
seeking to widen their power bases and, in Calderon's case, maintain a strong 
grip on his former Assembly district. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Salazar's rivals have stressed their independence. 
</P>
<P>
"This race is really about the candidates running, not the people supporting 
them," Diane Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Maestas, who won the state Democratic Party's endorsement, added, "The person 
elected sits in the seat," not his or her supporters. Maestas' association with 
Calderon is prominently advertised in her campaign material and their campaigns 
share an office. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon sees the contest as evolving into a two-way race between Maestas and 
Diane Martinez -- either of whom would become the Legislature's second Latina 
member. The only current Latina member is Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard 
(D-Los Angeles), daughter of longtime U.S. Rep. Edward Roybal. 
</P>
<P>
Others suggested that Becerra could make the race a three-way fight, especially 
because his ballot designation -- deputy attorney general -- could give him a 
boost in an area where voters are worried about crime and increased gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Registered Democrats hold a better than 2-1 edge in the 59th District, which 
means the party's primary winner will be the heavy favorite to win the seat in 
November. The Democratic nominee will square off against one of two Republican 
candidates running in their party's primary and a Libertarian. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly contest was set in motion a year ago when Sen. Montoya was 
indicted in a federal political corruption case. Even before Montoya's 
conviction in February prompted him to resign, Calderon was poised to run for 
the Senate seat, triggering a scramble to replace him in the Assembly. At one 
point, Calderon's brother and a close friend flirted with running before 
Maestas jumped into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
For the candidate who ultimately wins the election, the Assembly seat could be 
a steppingstone to higher office. Besides former Sen. Montoya, Rep. Martinez 
and Sens. Torres and Calderon all represented the area in the Assembly before 
moving up the political ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the interest the primary campaign has generated because of its cast 
of characters, the race signals a new era in reduced-budget legislative 
contests, prompted by the 1988 passage of Proposition 73. That initiative 
limited contributions and prohibited transfers of huge sums of money from such 
party leaders as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). Brown, in 
fact, is staying on the sidelines in the 59th District contest, making local 
endorsements all the more important. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Martinez acknowledged that the new contribution limits make it harder to 
raise money. But "everybody's in the same boat," he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Through the middle of March -- the last time reports were required to be filed 
with the secretary of state -- his daughter had raised almost $53,000, more 
than any of her opponents. That included a $29,700 loan from Diane Martinez to 
her own treasury. Becerra reported $23,000 in donations, Maestas $8,000, 
Hernandez $5,800 and Salazar $800. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LATINO POLITICAL SPLIT 
</P>
<P>
 Four prominent Latino elected officials -- including two congressmen -- are 
casting their shadows on the Democratic primary campaign in Los Angeles 
County's 59th Assembly District. In an unusually fractured political scenario, 
each of the officials has his own favorite candidate for the vacant seat. Here 
is the cast of characters:

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 OF DISTRICT'S SCHOOLS WILL BECOME 
YEAR-ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lancaster School District, seeking relief from crowded classrooms, has 
decided to begin moving toward a year-round calendar by converting two of its 
14 campuses to the controversial schedule this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The change will mean an early end to summer vacation for students at Lincoln 
and Nancy Cory elementary schools, both of which opened last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Year-round classes there will begin Aug. 6, about a month ahead of other 
schools in the 10,800-student district. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees voted 5-0 Tuesday to approve the switch. Parents will 
have the choice of keeping children in those schools or transferring them to 
schools with traditional calendars. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster officials said most parents have supported the switch so far, which 
is designed to relieve overcrowding in the fast-growing area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BURGLARY SUSPECT SHOT AFTER TAKING PATROL 
CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A burglary suspect was shot Wednesday after she slipped out of her handcuffs 
and drove off in a Long Beach police car, running over an officer's foot. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who was shot in the leg by the officer, was captured a few blocks 
away after she dragged herself out of the car and asked a bicyclist for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 9:30 a.m. when officer Jay Fogg, responding to a 
burglary call, saw the suspect walking into a home, handcuffed her and placed 
her in the front seat of his patrol car, said Long Beach Detective George Fox. 
By the time Fogg returned from talking to the occupant of the house, the woman 
was driving away, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Fogg was treated for a dislocated ankle at Pacific Hospital of Long Beach. The 
suspect, identified by officials at St. Mary Medical Center as Betty Ortega, 
49, was in serious condition following surgery. Police said she will be booked 
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and burglary.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'ONION FIELD' KILLER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paroled "Onion Field" police killer Jimmy Lee Smith was arrested in Van Nuys 
after he allegedly threatened a man with a butcher knife, Los Angeles police 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 59, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, 
two weeks after a man complained that Smith had threatened him, Lt. Warren 
Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who police said was under the influence of heroin when arrested, was 
being held without bail because the arrest violates conditions of his parole. 
</P>
<P>
It was yet another arrest for Smith, who was paroled in 1982 after serving 19 
years for his role in the 1963 slaying of Los Angeles Police Officer Ian 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and his partner, Officer Karl Hettinger, were abducted in Hollywood by 
Smith and Gregory Powell and driven to an onion field south of Bakersfield. 
Powell killed Campbell but Hettinger escaped. The case was recounted in Joseph 
Wambaugh's best-selling 1973 book "The Onion Field."

"They were tied hand and foot, and both were shot through the head," Moret 
said. He added that a small quantity of cocaine was found on a coffee table of 
the home in the 9600 block of 2nd Avenue, and other evidence also led 
detectives to conclude it was the site of drug dealing.

Moore's mother discovered the bodies Wednesday morning after she came to the 
house because she had been unable to get through by telephone.

2 WORKERS BURIED IN CAVE-IN SAVED;

Los Angeles firefighters painstakingly dug for 4 1/2 hours in a 10-foot-deep 
trench -- sometimes using coffee cans to scoop out dirt -- to rescue two 
workers who were trapped at a construction site near MacArthur Park Wednesday. 
The accident happened when an unenforced wall of dirt collapsed on top of them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the men were up to their chins in dirt, the unidentified workers 
suffered only minor injuries during the ordeal, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A third worker at the construction site at 828 S. Carondelet St. also was 
briefly trapped in the 10:30 a.m. collapse, but was able to scramble to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"These men were very lucky," said Assistant Fire Chief Bob Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
After both men had been rescued, an inspector with the California Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration ordered the construction site closed while 
state and city officials look into the cause of the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the property, Frank Arrechea of Los Angeles, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The project contractor, who was at the site, also declined to comment and even 
declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of more than 100 onlookers crowded around in the Westlake district 
neighborhood as rescuers worked into mid-afternoon. Some shouted words of 
encouragement to the firefighters from buildings that overlook the construction 
site, where an 18-unit apartment building is being built. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were summoned to the scene after dirt collapsed while workers were 
digging what appeared to be an underground walkway for the building. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters worked for about 90 minutes before freeing the first trapped 
worker, a 22-year-old man from Guatemala. He was rushed to County-USC Medical 
Center, where he was listed in stable condition with a possible broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuing the second worker was tougher because he was pinned in a standing 
position in the bottom of the trench. The opening at that point was only 15 
inches wide. His right arm was trapped in a raised position, causing the worker 
to believe he would lose the limb, one rescuer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was panicking and I told him to calm down, that we could get him out," said 
paramedic Charlie Magdaleno. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said firefighters, fearful that more dirt might collapse on the trapped 
worker, took their time and used wood pilings to reinforce the trench before 
trying to pull him out. A special county trench excavation team was summoned to 
help out. 
</P>
<P>
Several rescuers were lowered headfirst into the trench to scoop out dirt near 
the pinned worker with coffee cans. The rescuers also cut off the handles of 
several shovels because of the close quarters. 
</P>
<P>
About three hours after the noon rescue of the first worker, the second man -- 
a Salvadoran who was repeatedly reassured in Spanish by paramedic Magdaleno -- 
was pulled out of the hole. He also was taken to County-USC Medical Center, 
where he was listed in stable condition with pain in his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers at the site complained to reporters about unsafe conditions, 
including the fact that none of the men working in the trench wore hard hats. 
They also complained that only one of the trench's walls was reinforced when 
the collapse occurred.

IRWINDALE, CRIPPLED BY LEGAL BILLS, SEEKS TO SETTLE LAWSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bogged down with $2.5 million in legal bills and the collapse of its bid to 
land the Los Angeles Raiders, Irwindale officials say they are ready to settle 
several lawsuits against them in order to minimize financial losses and 
political embarrassment to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Chico said this week that the new settlement efforts were spurred 
by last month's elections. Though Chico said he has wanted to end the 
litigation "for quite a while . . . I was more passive knowing I wasn't going 
to change anything until the council changed. Now we have to take corrective 
steps." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a closed council session held last week, City Atty. Charles Martin 
said: "We were directed to settle as many as we can so we will try. Our legal 
fees each month have been $30,000, $40,000. No city can endure spending that 
kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
In the closed-door meeting last week, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to make 
good-faith efforts to settle: 
</P>
<P>
* Two suits against former redevelopment consultant Frederick P. Lyte, who 
spearheaded the Raiders deal but was fired in 1988 after a falling-out with 
Councilman Patricio Miranda. Irwindale claims Lyte illegally received 
commissions on projects he recommended to the city and should pay $2 million in 
damages. In a countersuit, Lyte claims the city owes him $1.2 million in back 
wages. Martin and two other city officials met with Lyte Tuesday to discuss a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
* A suit against Irwindale by newly elected Councilman Frederick Barbosa. The 
suit claims the $10 million in good-faith money that Irwindale paid to Raiders 
owner Al Davis was an illegal gift of public money. A second Barbosa suit 
resulted in an injunction barring Irwindale from negotiating with the team 
until it completed an environmental impact report on the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
* A suit against Miranda by Brenda Marin, a resident who claims the councilman 
violated conflict-of-interest laws in a redevelopment agency project involving 
land that Marin owns. Irwindale is paying for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda and Councilman Salvador Hernandez voted against the settlement talks. 
Hernandez said he believes Irwindale would win the Lyte suit if it went to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte said Tuesday he has tried to settle with the city but was opposed by 
Miranda, Hernandez and former Councilman Joseph Breceda, who lost his seat 
April 10. Barbosa, Chico and Councilman Robert Diaz voted for the latest 
settlement effort.

BOOKS: AN ACCOUNT OF ABUSE OF GERMAN SOLDIERS BY FRENCH AND AMERICAN TROOPS AT 
THE END OF WORLD WAR II HAS STIRRED CONTROVERSY IN CANADA.

<P>
We never saw the Red Cross. Nobody came to inspect us until two years later, to 
bring us blankets. That was the first time they came, in 1947. We were eating 
the grass between the buildings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But for the date, the description could be that of a Nazi death camp survivor, 
liberated by Allied troops at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the words are those of "Pvt. Heinz T.," a former Wehrmacht soldier 
rounded up by U.S. troops at the war's end and imprisoned in a camp for 
surrendered Germans. A Canadian novelist-turned-amateur historian, James Bacque 
says he interviewed Heinz T. in Paris in 1986 and quotes him in his new book, 
"Other Losses." 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Later, when the weakness really came and the slightest movement made 
(us) faint, we could calculate how many hours we would pass out. The 
malnutrition got to such a stage that the smallest gesture done too quickly 
would cause us to faint. The first time it happened to me, we were sitting down 
in the sun with nothing to do, absolutely nothing. I can remember saying to 
myself . . . OK, there is still six hours until the soup, and . . . if I do 
this quick little movement with my arm, I'll be out for three hours, if I do it 
again, that's another three hours, so (that's) six hours altogether. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Heinz T.'s disquieting story and others like it burst into the Canadian 
consciousness late last year, when "Other Losses" was published by Stoddart 
Publishing Co. Ltd., of Toronto. The book makes the case that French and 
American soldiers abused and neglected German soldiers in their care at the end 
of World War II, causing the slow deaths of thousands. Bacque calls the abuse a 
war crime, saying that the United States wriggled through a loophole in the 
Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war by reclassifying the 
surrendered Germans as disarmed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Since its publication, "Other Losses" has engendered a lively debate in Canada, 
with some readers, largely professional historians, challenging Bacque's 
research methods, and others, elderly German immigrants, stepping forward to 
say they lived through American-made horrors just like the ones Bacque 
describes. 
</P>
<P>
"This (book) is cracked, top to bottom," says Brian Loring Villa, a University 
of Ottawa specialist on the raid on Dieppe, France. "The Liberty Bell looks 
like it just came out of the foundry compared to this." 
</P>
<P>
But Willi Pohl, 68, a German veteran who lives in Montreal, counters: "Many of 
the things Mr. Bacque wrote about in his book . . . are exactly what we 
experienced. They kept us for three months in the open fields without blankets. 
We received six teaspoons a day of food. (Men) died en masse." 
</P>
<P>
The debate surrounding the publication of "Other Losses" in Canada contrasts 
sharply with the situation in the United States. South of the 49th Parallel, 
few know such a book exists, much less hold an opinion of it. And in America's 
ignorance, author Bacque asserts, there are lessons to be learned. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to know about freedom of the press, you've come to the right 
place," he says in an interview in his Toronto living room. "It is a sometime 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Other Losses" offers detailed evidence of grave American and French breaches 
of the Geneva Convention. The book describes vast prisoner of war camps where 
Germans were denied blankets and tents on freezing nights; camps where 
thousands of Germans were fed a fraction of the calories needed to sustain 
life; camps without latrines where dysentery became epidemic; camps where 
drinking water was dumped tauntingly on the ground in front of thirsty men. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the book's eyewitnesses tell of emaciated bodies stacked in heaps and 
covered with quicklime. Others talk of prisoners drinking their own urine for 
lack of water. One describes a weakened 14-year-old boy who fell off a log 
flung over a trench-latrine and drowned in excrement. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, "Other Losses" offers evidence that the International Committee of 
the Red Cross -- which has the right to inspect POW camps and report abuses -- 
was kept from the camps. 
</P>
<P>
Bacque also found a letter from the Quakers to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower -- 
then military governor of the U.S.-administered zone of Germany -- asking 
permission to feed German children and find adoptive parents for orphans. 
Eisenhower responded that such assistance would be "unwise." 
</P>
<P>
Historians have long known that abuses occurred in American- and French-run 
prison camps, but little on the subject has been published. What has caused the 
"Other Losses" controversy is not Bacque's willingness to throw light on a dark 
corner of history, but his use of what he found there to make broader 
allegations -- allegations that go to the heart of America's self-image as a 
democratic and humane model for the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
First, Bacque claims the willful neglect of the surrendered Germans led to 
800,000 to 1 million deaths. He arrived at that number by tabulating the deaths 
in one POW camp over a short period and applying that rate to other camps. 
Bacque admits the numbers are shaky, and he has been criticized for his 
statistical methods. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Bacque argues that Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied forces 
and U.S. President from 1953 to 1961, not only knew what was going on but 
encouraged it. Bacque bases his assertion on Eisenhower's decision to 
reclassify the German POWs as "Disarmed Enemy Forces," or DEFs, thereby 
exempting them from the Geneva Convention. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, he was personally responsible for much of this," says Bacque, a 
judgment that sets off howls of protest from his critics in this, the 
centennial of Eisenhower's birth. 
</P>
<P>
Bacque, who went through three literary agents as he tried to peddle his 
manuscript in the United States, says that more than 30 American publishers 
rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
It received a better reception abroad. After Canada, the book came out in 
Germany and France, and a British house has scheduled its release for later 
this year. Bacque says rights have been placed in Turkey, Holland and Japan, 
and the British Broadcasting Corp. has a documentary based on the book in the 
works. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, "Other Losses" has received unsolicited promotion through 
the Institute for Historical Review, a Costa Mesa-based revisionist group whose 
members doubt that Adolf Hitler had Jews exterminated as a matter of policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the closest thing I can think of to being published by samizdat in the 
United States," says Bacque, who is keeping cautious distance between himself 
and the institute, but will not stop its promotion effort. "Glasnost in America 
-- that's my cry." 
</P>
<P>
Bacque says his father was gassed by the Germans in Ypres, Belgium, during 
World War I, and says he never intended to write a book sympathetic to a people 
his parents taught him to fear. He had, in fact, set out to write a biography 
of Raoul Laporterie, a French Resistance hero who saved 1,500 French Jews from 
Nazi persecution. In 1986, he and a research assistant rented a villa near 
Laporterie's home and received permission from the aging Frenchman to comb 
through his archives. 
</P>
<P>
There, Bacque found a series of friendly letters from Hans Goertz. Bacque found 
this odd, since Goertz was not a Jew, but a former Wehrmacht soldier. Bacque 
and his assistant -- who spoke German -- traveled to Germany to ask Goertz why 
he had corresponded with Laporterie. When they did, Bacque says, Goertz told 
them the French war hero had saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
The German explained that, at war's end, Allied soldiers put him in a POW camp 
where, in a single month, a quarter of the prisoners died of starvation, 
dysentery and other causes. Goertz said Laporterie plucked him out of this 
misery and gave him work in his tailor shop. 
</P>
<P>
That story changed the focus of Bacque's work. He says he spent the next three 
years and more than $100,000 of his own money trying to find out how many Hans 
Goertzes there were, and why the Allied camp guards committed what he came to 
believe were atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
His research brought him to Stephen Ambrose, director of the Eisenhower Center 
at the University of New Orleans, author of several volumes on Eisenhower and 
an editor of the general's official papers. Ambrose says he looked over 
Bacque's manuscript, found some merit in it, and even recommended it to his 
editor at Simon &amp; Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that German POWs died of starvation," he says, noting that 
he himself has heard former Wehrmacht soldiers' tales of beatings and 
deprivation. "Bacque is the first person to break this story into the open. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
But, Ambrose says, he thought Bacque had read far too much meaning into his 
evidence in concluding that Eisenhower had conceived, or at least condoned, 
systematic mistreatment. Ambrose says he believes the starvation of POWs 
resulted from an effort to conserve food for the people Eisenhower most wanted 
to feed at the end of the war: Allied troops, liberated Europeans, and 
concentration camp survivors. 
</P>
<P>
It was the failure to address such "flaws" that led Simon &amp; Schuster to 
reject the book, not a pro patria bias, Ambrose says. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ferris, an editor for Houghton Mifflin, concurred. "I thought (the 
manuscript) was of very significant historical importance. But it didn't hold 
together as a book," he says, adding that Bacque failed to meet the house's 
standard of excellence, set by writers such as Winston Churchill, Arthur 
Schlesinger and John Kenneth Galbraith. 
</P>
<P>
Ferris says that he expects other historians to take up the "Other Losses" 
controversy now that Bacque has fired the first shot. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Ambrose has called an international conference on the path-breaking 
themes of "Other Losses" at the Eisenhower Center for next January. Canadian 
historian Villa, who acknowledges that Bacque "reminds us of crimes against the 
helpless," has written a long paper on the controversy and is seeking a U.S. 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
In Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Martin Brech, a retired Unitarian minister, has written 
an account of his own experience as a POW camp guard in Germany at the end of 
World War II. He still has flashbacks: starving prisoners eating grass, thirsty 
men bursting through barbed wire and dashing, amid gunfire, toward a nearby 
river. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have the integrity to admit this atrocity, that means we have shared in 
the banality of evil," Brech says. 
</P>
<P>
Brech says that he sent his statement to major U.S. newspapers and magazines 
but none published it. Since he stepped forward, though, he says that his 
mailbox has been smashed, his car vandalized, and his phone now rings with 
threatening calls.

VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS, OR AT LEAST GREAT BURGERS, DANCE IN YOUR HEAD AFTER TRIP 
TO SANTA CLAUS LANE

I can remember, as a child, driving between Summerland and Carpinteria and 
seeing for the first time the great plaster Santa Claus rising out of its giant 
red chimney at Santa Claus Lane. When it loomed up in my vision through the 
window of the car, I thought it was the most thrilling thing I had ever seen. 
Later, of course, my enthusiasm faded -- as did Santa himself, and the Lane 
fell into a kind of charming seediness. 
</P>
<P>
Now as I whiz by my spirits lift again. Not from the newly refurbished Santa, 
but from the sight of a big funky sign that says BURGERS. Because now I have 
the satisfaction of knowing where to get the best hamburger from here to the 
real North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few hundred feet from the ocean, Pacific Grill is located in a gray 
board-and-batten cottage that was once an antique shop. Now it's a hamburger 
stand with de rigueur floors of painted cement, a Pepsi-Cola menu board, molded 
plastic chairs and checkered tablecloths. But there's an unmistakable touch of 
class as well: too-beautiful posters of local landscapes on the walls, fresh 
flowers on the tables and a surprising selection of wine and beer. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing is true of the food, starting with the bowl of sliced lemons set 
out with the condiments. A fairly ordinary breakfast, lunch and dinner menu 
becomes something special here. In addition to salads and sandwiches, there are 
12 kinds of burgers, ranging from old standards such as double cheeseburgers to 
new tastes such as calamari burgers and throwbacks such as buffalo burgers. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite is the sourdough burger with guacamole. The bread is a truly sour 
sourdough, and the freshly ground meat doesn't fall apart or drip grease. If I 
have any complaint it is that there's so much meat. The guacamole (slightly 
garlicky), fresh tomato slices and crunchy leaf lettuce are delicious in 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The owner, Al Rivera, used to be in the wholesale fish business, and his wife, 
Sally, catered clambakes; they really know their fish. The mahi mahi burger, 
made with very fresh mahi mahi, is grilled not fried. A wonderful crab salad, 
big enough for two, comes with sliced avocado and the best lettuce imaginable. 
The unthickened clam chowder is chock-full of tasty, chewy clams, and the broth 
has a light butter and lemon flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Before I ever ordered the chili at Pacific Grill I had heard it described as 
famous, but I thought, so what? My Uncle Bob's chili is famous; everyone's 
chili is famous. However, Al's specialty is a lesson in how a chili can merit 
its reputation. It contains tender chunks of beef and small, firm beans and has 
an arresting, mysterious flavor. Al, who keeps no secrets, will cheerfully give 
all the credit to the Santa Cruz chili powder he imports from Tubac, Ariz. I'm 
inclined to think that the ground coriander is what makes it so good. 
</P>
<P>
When I think of Pacific Grill, I think of a hot day in early spring when I took 
my family. My husband, the outdoorsman, headed straight for the picnic tables 
under the cypress trees beyond the patio. We sat there until blue dusk. The 
kids played catch in the grass until it got too dark to see the ball, and I 
complained it was too dark to see the food. At last we convinced my husband to 
come indoors, into the bright and cozy restaurant, with a promise to play 
"Loco-Motion" on the jukebox and go for a walk on the beach after dinner. 
That's Pacific Grill to me. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Grill. 3765 Santa Claus Lane, Carpinteria. 684-7670. Open 8 a.m. to 8 
p.m. every day except Thanksgiving and Christmas. Meal for one $3.25-$6.25.

SOPHIA'S BEAUTY IS AGELESS

<P>
A fringe benefit of having a husband who writes movies is meeting famous 
people. That is how I became friends with Sophia Loren. And when Sophia is not 
in Geneva or Paris or Rome or in her Florida island condo or shooting in 
Yugoslavia, she's right here in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
She was here on "the ranch" recently, resting up from promotional tours, and 
once again teaching me the lesson that she says American women need to learn -- 
that being your age and being yourself is attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing makes a woman look older than an exaggerated effort to look young," 
she told me, lounging around her rambling early California house in a huge, 
comfortable man's sweater with a terry turban wrapped round her hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Older women in this youth-oriented society have a difficult time. In France, 
it is easier. The appreciation of maturity is instilled in the culture." She 
laughed. "Wine and women. You know," she said, looking onto the garden at the 
ancient Roman column she and her producer-husband, Carlo Ponti, brought with 
them from their country house outside Rome. "Old is beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning it must not have been easy for Sophia to grow older. After 
all, she had launched her career by winning a beauty contest and became known 
as a great beauty. It was natural for her to assume that she was successful 
because she was beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
When I met her in 1960 in Madrid, I was dazzled. As a journalist of the period 
wrote, "her mouth was too large, her nose too long, her chin and lips too 
broad, yet the sum of the parts was somehow beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
After getting to know her, I concluded that her beauty was her intelligence and 
wit, her excitement about life, her determination to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the young Sophia put a great deal of emphasis on material beauty. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time Sophia turned 50 in 1984 and her book "Women and Beauty" was 
published, she became convinced that "a woman's self-esteem should be based not 
on passive beauty, but on accomplishment, achievement and skills that increase 
with age. Beauty must be understood as something that comes out of personal 
experience," she wrote. "Being a thoughtful, interested and competent human 
being shows in the face, in the crinkle of the eyes, the set of the chin, the 
bearing of one who knows where she has been, where she is going and how to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
I remember Christmas, 1968, when I visited Sophia in Geneva. On doctor's 
orders, she'd spent most of every day in bed for all nine months of pregnancy 
so she would not miscarry. Specialists had told her she'd never have a baby. 
But there she was in her ninth month a few days before Carlo Jr. was born. 
She'd won -- over all the forces of nature. 
</P>
<P>
That's what makes Sophia beautiful, not which shade of mascara which hair tint, 
how stylish her clothes or how many hours she spends on appearance. She has 
great good taste and is very professional, spending time thinking out how to 
look her best. She has always been a pro, which is why so many think her 
success is due to beauty and don't realize what a good actress she is -- and 
how hard she works. 
</P>
<P>
And her determination and hard work are not just for her career. Family means a 
great deal to someone who didn't know her father. She is as proud of her role 
as wife and mother as she is of her acting roles. She smiles as she watches her 
vacationing sons, slamming around the driveway in mini racing cars. Carlo Jr., 
21, has musical talent and attends an American college. Edoardo, 17, who will 
soon graduate from a Swiss high school, has already acted in a film. 
</P>
<P>
Sophia doesn't vacation long. She just finished a remake for television of "Two 
Women," a role for which she won an Oscar in 1961. She is also preparing 
"Saturday, Sunday and Monday," a film with Marcello Mastroianni in the same 
spirit as the comedies in which the pair co-starred when they were younger. 
"I've never let up," she says. "And I've reached something unreachable."

A CUP OF JAVA;

<P>
COFFEE: IT GIVES PEOPLE AN EXCUSE TO GATHER, SIP AND REVEAL WHAT THEY'RE 
THINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coffee makes politicians wise (according to Alexander Pope), fills 400 million 
cups in the United States daily (according to the World Book encyclopedia) and 
was discovered more than 700 years ago by Ethiopian shepherds who noticed their 
flocks nibbling green shrubs and staying up all night (according to a legend we 
wonder about). 
</P>
<P>
But the best thing about coffee may be that it gives people an excuse to 
gather, to sip and to disclose what they're thinking. And you never know what 
someone's thinking until you listen, especially in a place like Ventura County, 
where the population swells daily with new surfers, Seabees, Angelenos, 
agricultural workers, Oxnard youths and Simi Valley seniors. 
</P>
<P>
And so, seeking the hidden truth about this place, Ventura County Life went out 
for coffee -- a dozen cups of it, in sturdy mugs and fine china, by the ocean 
and the avenue. Through eavesdropping and inquiry, we met a sleeping snake and 
a crew-cut revolutionary, heard talk of camel-mounting and numerology. We 
pondered an insect collection, and the subtle circumstances said to produce a 
pink moment. 
</P>
<P>
And we switched to decaf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Live Lions and One Dead Deer 
</P>
<P>
Cactus Patch Cafe 
</P>
<P>
197 E. High St., Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: Amiable and countrified. On the wall behind the counter, the stuffed 
head of an eight-point buck. A rack of mugs belonging to George, Andy, Nina, 
Howard and someone who loves his or her spaniel. Also, some Western art, 
assorted firearms and hatchets, and a lariat dangling from the ceiling. On 
first and third Thursdays, Lions gather here -- the dues-paying variety. 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: White, of standard cafeteria stock, with a red leaf pattern running 
around the top. Liquid cream in a stainless steel cup on the counter -- 65 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Music involving a fiddle on the sound system. Soft clinking, as 
a busboy strides down the aisle with seven coffee cups, empty, in one hand. And 
lots of chat, it being 9 a.m. on a weekday. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: None of the regular customers really loves his or her spaniel that 
much; somebody just left the mug behind one day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where Oil and Water Mix 
</P>
<P>
The Cliff House Hotel 
</P>
<P>
The Shoals Restaurant 
</P>
<P>
6602 W. Pacific Coast Highway, 
</P>
<P>
Mussel Shoals 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: A 43-year-old family-run hotel and restaurant with a lap pool, half 
a dozen palm trees drooping over it, and a bizarre position near the Rincon 
shore between two oil platform bridges. 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: In the morning, free to hotel guests and stealthful interlopers -- but 
forbidden to others, since the restaurant is closed then -- $1 with a dinner 
(which begins at $11.95) or just dessert ($4.25) from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. 
The cups are plastic foam by morning, with cream in plastic thimbles. By night, 
china. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Waves crashing on rocks. Bird twitter. And Michele Porter, 
co-proprietor, saying, "Most of our guests are yuppie types from L.A. looking 
for peace and quiet. And finding it." 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: The place looks downright dignified now, but through the early 
1970s, Porter says, it was a bohemian apartment complex -- lots of surfers and 
students from Santa Barbara's Brooks Institute of Photography, who for a while 
had their own darkroom on the premises. Notable detail: This is the westernmost 
cup of coffee in mainland Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coffee-Mate and a Snake 
</P>
<P>
Little Manila Restaurant 
</P>
<P>
3630 Saviers Road, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: In the corner of a strip mall, between Tino's Pizza and the D-Mar 
Beauty &amp; Barber Shop. Inside, duct tape on the red carpet, a pool table in 
the corner, and a reflecting ball above the central dance floor (this is Club 
Manila on Friday and Saturday nights). Also, a couple of aquariums and one 
terrarium (its scaled occupant was asleep), which may make Little Manila the 
only restaurant in the county offering snakeside dining. What kind of snake is 
it? "Ah, I don't know," says owner Sing Cunanan. "It's just here. . . " and he 
finishes the sentence under his breath. 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: Shiny cafeteria white, with a green pattern on its side. It comes on a 
saucer, with a packet of powdered Coffee-Mate, for 50 cents. Prompt and 
solicitous service. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: CNN on the big-screen television, the clinking of balls on the 
pool table. Among the four or five patrons on a Monday afternoon, lots of 
animated talk -- and all of it in Tagalog or other Philippine dialects. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: Unascertainable, until we learn Tagalog. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Numerologist's Tale 
</P>
<P>
Le Petit Boulangerie 
</P>
<P>
968 S. Westlake Blvd., Westlake Village 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: A popular morning stop in a leafy, tile-topped upscale mall. Lots of 
red and white, and at 7:45 on a Friday morning, a steady procession of 
prosperous coffee consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: A high-powered plastic foam cupful -- 75 cents. Cream on the 
self-service counter in plastic thimbles or an iced carafe. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Classical music, the hum of the revolving bakery display and a 
wide-ranging conversation among the party of five at the next table. Retinal 
scans, the relative merits of B. Dalton and Waldenbooks, the merchandise of 
stores in the Akron chain -- none was overlooked. Nor were Shirley MacLaine, 
crystals and the pursuit of numerology. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: Or at least it might be the truth. A man in jeans and a gray sweat 
shirt sits revealing his first encounter with a numerologist. "She told me I 
would meet a girl with black hair, a black dog, a black car, and who was born 
Oct. 11," he says. Five months later, his story goes, he did. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weiners and Lost Love 
</P>
<P>
Top Hat 
</P>
<P>
299 E. Main St., Ventura 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: East Main and Palm, in a tiny corner building among the antique 
stores and thrift shops of old Ventura. Two servers in Top Hat blouses power 
their way through the lunchtime rush. As one reaches for the counter, a tattoo 
peeks from her neckline. Customers stand, or sit at stools on the sidewalk. 
"Your mother doesn't work here," says a sign in the kitchen. "Clean up your own 
mess." 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: Plastic foam, of course, but only 25 cents for a small one. Liquid 
cream, from a dispenser they keep just inside the counter screen. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Traffic, vehicular and pedestrian, and the gurgle of grease in 
the french fry fryers. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: An awkward one. "How's Louis?" says person No. 1. "I'm not with him 
anymore," says person No. 2. "That was a long time ago, thank God." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Global Problems Solved Here 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bell Cafe 
</P>
<P>
3241 Main St., Ventura 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: Close quarters, but comfortable. Heavy traffic in regulars, 
including Leighton Stuart, a beefy electrician who wears a crew cut and sits at 
the counter second-guessing city, county, state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: A light brown mug, bearing signs of more than a few washings -- 75 
cents. Cream along the counter in little thimbles. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Somebody on the sound system, not Sinatra, singing "My Way." 
The busboy calling for Stuart's attention, saying "Let me show you one of your 
relatives," and reaching for a newspaper photo of some successful bank robbers. 
And Stuart cutting the busboy off. "Those ain't my relatives," he says, "or I'd 
be down at the Pierpont Inn." 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: "I'm a revolutionary," Stuart says, and he begins assembling a 
manifesto out loud. Exxon got off easy for its oil spill, he says, and the City 
Council is moving too fast and thinking too little about water-conservation 
measures. And the drivers in Ventura just keep getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Of Bugs and Camels 
</P>
<P>
Pierpont Inn 
</P>
<P>
550 Sanjon Road, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: A darkish room with a view of a bright garden and, beyond it, the 
freeway and the sea. Heavy wood paneling and, in the lobby, a collection of 
butterflies, moths and beetles (including one 5 inches long), framed and 
preserved under glass near the restaurant entrance. At 8:45 on a Wednesday 
morning, just two occupied tables (business guests are more frequent on 
Mondays). 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: Beige, with a brown ring around the top and matching saucer -- $1, 
recently raised from 75 cents. Cream in a cup at the table. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Talk from the foursome at the next table, which includes a 
visiting couple from Chicago. Subjects include medical research and a 
once-upon-a-time vacation in Morocco, when camels were ridden and there was 
some trouble with the mounting. The man in this couple has a low, rumbling 
voice, which carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: "A camel doesn't get up gently," says the voice. "It jerks." (About 
the bugs. They were part of a collection gathered by co-owner Ted Gleichmann, 
who died in 1976.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Sliding Coffee Scale 
</P>
<P>
The Rock House 
</P>
<P>
396 Ventura Ave., Ventura 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: Positively Ventura Avenue, with the Eclectic Fighting Arts Institute 
just across the street. Inside, darkness, a dozen framed mirrors with 
beer-label designs, and at 10 a.m. on a weekday, no customers. The place is 
quiet and tidy, but the drum set of The Southbound Band, now appearing Friday 
and Saturday nights, stands in the darkest corner hinting at noises to come. 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: A plastic mug, with a plastic stirring straw and cream poured by 
bartender David Roundsavill. Free to regulars. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Whoosh of passing cars. Jukebox idle. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: "In the mornings, we'll go through a lot of coffee on regular 
customers. If it's too early to start drinking, we'll just keep the coffee 
going," says Roundsavill, a 10 a.m. glass of beer near his elbow. "If a street 
person comes in and wants coffee, I'll tell them 50 cents, and they'll just 
walk on out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destiny and Joan Crawford 
</P>
<P>
Stella's Gourmet Restaurant 
</P>
<P>
2385 Michael Drive, Newbury Park 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: Affluent suburbia -- a shopping center with 31-flavor ice cream, 
60-minute photo, 30-minute pizza, the whole upper-middle-class magilla. 
Stella's stakes out its space with a handful of umbrellas, a smallish indoor 
eating area and a biggish menu. It runs nine pages, with a table of contents, 
credits for the copywriter and calligrapher, and this opening sentence: 
"Perhaps it was destiny . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: Thick, white china, with liquid cream in thimbles -- $1. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Soft rock, resonating from the gray-tile floor and the 
wall-mirror panels. Late on a weekday morning, the murmur of a few quiet 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: Never mind destiny. More likely it was celebrity, and that large 
menu, that made Stella's what it is. Stella's dad emigrated from Greece in 1905 
at age 14, and went on to open the 101 Ranch House in Oxnard, which, it says on 
the menu, fed such celebrities as Joan Crawford, Richard Burton and Charles 
Laughton. Now, having run her own place since 1981, Stella Scholle serves 
sandwiches named after John Wayne and Shelley Winters to the people of Newbury 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brickwork and Horse Talk 
</P>
<P>
Appetite Alley 
</P>
<P>
322 1/2 Central Ave., Fillmore 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: On the redeveloping main drag of tiny downtown Fillmore, where 
ranchers and their new neighbors step carefully around the fancy sidewalk 
brickwork. A regular morning group inhabits Appetite Alley. 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: White, with the restaurant name in green lettering on the side. Price 
advertised on the wall paneling near the front -- 40 cents. Cream from a 
carton. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Real estate businessman John McKinnon asking former jockey 
Shorty Belloumini what he feeds a young colt. Lots of ribbing among locals. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: While big-city ways invade the rest of the county, Belloumini and a 
few of his neighbors cling to country ways. Belloumini sold a horse the other 
day, says McKinnon, by handing over the reigns and telling the new owner to try 
the animal out for a few weeks and, if all went well, to send along a check. 
Belloumini, in his 80s, has lived in Fillmore for 46 years. McKinnon has been 
there for eight, but says "you have to have someone buried here to call 
yourself a native." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caution: Shells Underfoot 
</P>
<P>
The Oak Pit 
</P>
<P>
830 Ventura Ave., Oak View 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: A barbecue joint, with the scent from the grill rising. A pair of 
12-point horns on the wall in the place of honor, and a bear's head staring out 
from over the front door. Peanuts in baskets on the tables, a wagon-wheel 
chandelier, and this small sign at the counter: "Stuff Occurs." 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: Dark brown and white. Cream in a stainless cup -- 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Crunching, loud and steady, as customers tromp on thousands of 
peanut-shell fragments scattered underfoot. And the voice of manager Tricia 
Clegg, whose parents own the place, explaining that one night three or four 
years ago, "these people wanted to have a party here, and they wanted peanuts 
and beer before they ate. And they had a peanut fight. We just never cleaned 
them up. . . . It creates the right atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: Actually, they pick non-peanut detritus out of the shells every 
night, and they sweep out the shells every two or three weeks. But they keep 
putting out peanuts, so the shells keep falling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Pink Moment, as Advertised 
</P>
<P>
Bill Baker's Bakery 
</P>
<P>
457 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai 
</P>
<P>
The Scene: A constellation of wooden tables, mostly empty, in the noon calm 
after the usual weekday morning storm. One waitress at the counter, the other 
in a seat for the moment, poring over a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The Cup: Plastic foam again, at a cost of 45 cents for a small, with cream 
waiting in a big pitcher on the counter. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundtrack: Mysterious bakery noises emanating from the rear of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The Truth: The summer Ojai Festival is coming up, and one of the event's 
promotional brochures is here, urging visitors to come see "the mysterious and 
breath-taking pink moment (flooding the Ojai Valley at sunset)." Both bakery 
waitresses deny knowledge of said moment. A woman at the spiritually inclined 
knickknack store next door suggests that it has something to do with sunlight 
and mineral dust. Somebody else says it's the depth of the valley and the angle 
of the sun. We could probably find another source and puzzle this whole pink 
thing out over a cup of coffee, but frankly, we're trying to cut down.

HAVING A CUP OF COFFEE ISN'T ALWAYS A SIMPLE MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE KEENEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember when a trip to the local cafe was pretty simple? Coffee was coffee. 
Cream was cream. Sugar, sugar. 
</P>
<P>
But not so anymore. Coffee is on the menu with a slew of other beverage names 
not all of which are found in the average dictionary. There are espressos, 
cappuccino, cafe au laits and lattes. And to further complicate things, it 
seems that just when you've decided you like lattes or cafe au laits, someone 
has to go and change the ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be embarrassed. After a poll of 14 local espresso establishments, it 
seems that consumers aren't the only ones who are confused. There was little or 
no agreement among the merchants as to exactly what a cappuccino or cafe au 
lait or latte is. 
</P>
<P>
That's probably why the public is confused. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seems to agree on espresso. That's easy. An espresso is a shot of 
dark, thick coffee that, if well-made, will be served with a thin layer of 
creamy brown foam on top. And, if the restaurant has a sense of style, it will 
be served in a demitasse cup accompanied with a lemon rind and a sugar cube. 
</P>
<P>
Beth McCarthy of the Kitchen Cafe was in agreement with most of the merchants 
when she said: "We sell far more cappuccinos than espresso. 
</P>
<P>
"But I miss the real espresso person," she added. "People go right to the 
cappuccinos and miss the whole espresso tradition of the lemon peel and the 
sugar cube, the spoon, the whole delicate little thing about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Americans think it is too strong," said Sam Fildi of Berto's Ristorante. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the merchants agreed on what a cappuccino is: a shot of espresso and a 
unit of steamed milk and foam. Voila is one exception. The recipe there is to 
put cocoa in first, then the coffee, then the steamed milk, then more cocoa. 
</P>
<P>
And when it comes to the murky area of cafe lattes and cafe au lait, there is 
no agreement at all. 
</P>
<P>
At City Bakery, a latte is a cappuccino with double milk, and cafe au lait is a 
regular coffee with steamed milk; at Berto's, cafe au lait is a cappuccino with 
more steamed milk, which is a cafe latte at the Kitchen Cafe in Ventura. The 
Clocktower Inn's cafe au lait is the Victoria's cappuccino. And so on. In fact, 
one restaurateur said she served both cafe au lait and cafe latte, and was 
unable to explain the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are as varied as the recipes. Espressos range from $1 to $3. Cappuccino 
ranges from $1.50 to $3. You can get them with flavors added (hazelnut and 
almond are popular). Or you can go wild. At Charlie's, there are a wild array 
of coffee drinks with liqueurs, including Cafe Charles -- a cappuccino with six 
different liqueurs added. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Ottavio's in Camarillo was the only restaurant beyond the grade that 
served it. About five years ago Voila Cafe blazed the way in Ventura. And now 
there are numerous places that serve these pungent brews, including Voila, 
Bedford's, the Clocktower Inn, Lorenzoni's Village Gourmet, Charlie's, the 
Royal Bakery, Berto's, Frankie's, the Victoria Pub, the Kitchen Cafe and City 
Bakery in Ventura; the Whale's Tail in Oxnard, and Ottavio's, Fabrizio's and 
the California Grill in Camarillo.

END OF MEDFLY SPRAYING NOW SET FOR MAY 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agriculture officials released a tentative spraying schedule Wednesday that 
indicates aerial malathion applications will end over 467 square miles of 
Southern California by May 14 -- only five days beyond a May 9 deadline 
officials promised last winter amid public outcry over the pesticide program. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule represents only a preliminary outline of the May battle plan, and 
it could undergo significant revision in the next few days. Nonetheless, it 
demonstrates the state's resolve to stick close to a deadline announced with 
fanfare last March by state Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry 
J. Voss. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to put something out for the schedule, but we can't be really 
certain of it at this point," said Gera Curry, a spokeswoman for the El 
Monte-based eradication effort. "It's tentative, but as far as we know, this is 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The state's scientific advisory panel, made up of five entomologists from 
around the country, was meeting in Los Angeles on Wednesday to discuss the 
strategic switch and is expected to announce recommendations this Friday. Voss 
will make a final decision on the spraying program. 
</P>
<P>
Panel member Richard Rice said he was uncertain if the plan is feasible, but 
added: "There's still a lot of hashing to go. We haven't come to any decision." 
</P>
<P>
Under the May schedule, the helicopter-borne spraying of pesticide would be 
ended by May 14 everywhere except the Riverside County community of Woodcrest 
and a portion of the city of San Bernardino. In those localities, where new 
outbreaks have been discovered, the aerial applications will come every week to 
10 days for as many as eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In other pockets of Medfly infestation, the pesticide applications will be 
replaced by a new tactic involving the release of millions of sterile flies 
intended to breed the fertile flies out of existence. In still other 
neighborhoods, officials believe eradication has been achieved and the steriles 
will not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to wind down the 9-month-old helicopter campaign carries risks. 
Scientists advising the state have said that spraying is being phased out 
prematurely in some neighborhoods, a mistake that could wipe out progress made 
so far and lead to even more intensive spraying. 
</P>
<P>
New Medfly discoveries also could throw the state's plan into confusion, and a 
summertime explosion of new Medfly activity indeed has been forecast by some 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
A timely example of the dilemma raised by new fly finds occurred Wednesday. 
Agriculture officials announced that yet another Medfly was trapped in Artesia. 
The fly was found within the current Downey spray zone, and Curry said the 
discovery could lead to the delay or abandonment of plans to end spraying 
there. No decision has been made, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks, agriculture officials have been scrambling to assure 
themselves that they could end aerial spraying by May 9 as promised. 
</P>
<P>
The promise applied specifically only to neighborhoods infested in March, but 
officials had hoped to make it stick for the entire region. When Voss announced 
the deadline, he was depending on an abundant supply of sterile Medflies to 
throw into the effort. Voss said he expected a reserve large enough to also 
treat any new outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Voss' announcement, however, Medfly outbreaks began popping up 
throughout the region, from Hancock Park to Woodcrest. So far, about 150 square 
miles have been added to the spray zone since the March announcement of a May 9 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The state's optimism also was shaken by production problems at the sterile 
Medfly breeding facilities in Hawaii. Agriculture officials have said they now 
expect to have just enough sterile flies to stop spraying in long-infested 
neighborhoods.

Frank H. Reed said Wednesday that he was with two other American hostages for 
part of his 43 months as a captive in Lebanon and offered the first 
confirmation that two British hostages, unheard of since their kidnaping in 
April, 1986, are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in a blue hospital bathrobe and shouting answers to questions from a 
balcony of the U.S. Air Force hospital here, Reed, 57, said he knows that 
Northern Irish lecturer Brian Keenan and British television journalist John 
McCarthy, captured in West Beirut on April 11 and April 17, 1986, respectively, 
are alive. 
</P>
<P>
No group of hostage-takers has ever claimed to hold Keenan, and the claim of a 
group that originally said it holds McCarthy had never been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Reed also said he saw fellow American hostage Thomas Sutherland about 14 months 
ago and had been held prisoner earlier with Terry A. Anderson, the American 
journalist who has been a hostage for more than five years, longer than any 
other Westerner. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very, very angry that Anderson -- Tom and Terry are not free," Reed said. 
"I am very, very angry that John and Brian are not free. Those are the only 
people I knew. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"For God's sake, it's nearly the sixth year for these men. I'm absolutely 
embarrassed I'm out before they are." 
</P>
<P>
About hostages McCarthy and Keenan, Reed was emphatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that John and Brian are alive," he said, adding that he had 
been with them from last October until his release Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office confirmed Wednesday that Reed's statement was the 
first evidence that McCarthy and Keenan are alive. Unconfirmed reports from the 
Middle East had suggested that McCarthy might have died. He was abducted on the 
same day that three hostages -- one American and two Britons -- were killed in 
retaliation for a U.S. bombing raid on Libya. 
</P>
<P>
A British organization, Friends of John McCarthy, reported that Reed told 
McCarthy's father that both men were well but suffer from minor health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who was director of the Lebanese International School, said he last saw 
hostage Sutherland, 57, the former dean of agriculture at the American 
University of Beirut, in February, 1989. Sutherland was abducted by a group 
identifying itself as the Islamic Jihad in June, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Reed did not say when he had seen Anderson, 42, the Associated Press's Beirut 
bureau chief, for the last time. But he did say he had spent two years of his 
captivity in the same house with Anderson, who was abducted by the Islamic 
Jihad in March, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's use of Anderson's last name and his first name in the same statement 
caused some confusion, since Anderson has the same first name as British 
hostage Terry Waite. Waite has not been seen since he was abducted in January, 
1987, while representing the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert A. K. Runcie, on 
a mission in Beirut to try to obtain freedom for the foreign hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists asked U.S. officials at the hospital to obtain a clarification from 
Reed, but they replied that he had gone to sleep and would not disturb him. 
U.S. State Department officials in Washington said there is no evidence that 
Reed was referring to Waite and not merely repeating his reference to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of Reed's statements about meeting fellow hostages and some 
information from Robert Polhill, who was released last week, eight days before 
Reed, U.S. counterterrorism officials say they are slightly revising their 
views of the various Lebanese groups holding the remaining U.S. and other 
foreign hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Government experts are growing more convinced that all are captives of radical 
Shiite Muslim groups that basically belong to one organization, Hezbollah 
(Party of God), which has direct links to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"We know, at least, that all the remaining American hostages are hostage to 
elements of Hezbollah," said one American official in Wiesbaden who asked that 
his name not be published. 
</P>
<P>
He said the government no longer believes that Libya had any hand in the 
capture of any of the six remaining Americans -- Anderson, Sutherland, Joseph 
J. Cicippio, Edward A. Tracy, Jesse Turner and Alann Steen. 
</P>
<P>
Counterterrorism officials in Washington said Wednesday that it now appears 
that the central figure in the release of two of the remaining six Americans, 
at least two of the British hostages and possibly other foreigners, is the 
shadowy Imad Mughniyah, leader of Islamic Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's abduction was originally claimed by the Revolutionary Commando 
Cells. Reed's statement now indicates that both he and Keenan are held by 
Islamic Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
Mughniyah's group may hold more hostages than any other Hezbollah cell, which 
may in turn give him more leverage over the Iranians or Syrians attempting to 
negotiate an end to the hostage crisis, the U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
His basic demand is freedom for the 15 remaining Lebanese imprisoned in Kuwait 
for six bombings in 1983, including attacks on the U.S. and French embassies. 
Among the prisoners is Mughniyah's brother-in-law, who was sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has repeatedly refused to discuss releasing the 15, but it has also not 
carried out the death sentence, imposed six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the recent round of public statements from the Iranian capital, Tehran, the 
basic demand for further action has centered on freedom for about 400 prisoners 
under Israeli control. Israel has indicated it is prepared to consider a swap 
that would also include three Israeli servicemen held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials said Kuwait is not prepared to negotiate, should that demand 
emerge again -- a factor that could complicate further hostage releases. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's shouted exchanges with reporters occurred when he appeared on the 
balcony for what was supposed to be just a "photo opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The shaggy gray beard he wore when he was released had been shaved off, and its 
absence only made him appear more frail and thin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling good but a little tired because I don't have any living muscles," 
Reed said as he stood in the spring sunlight, his wife Fahima, 39, and 
9-year-old son Tarek at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he plans to do first when he returns to the United States, probably 
on Friday, Reed responded: "Hide!" 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stay another week or two, but they want me out of here on Friday," 
he joked. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is confused by the flood of new information that has confronted him 
since his release. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much information that I've missed. I'm drowned in information," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, his Syrian-born wife, who prefers to be called Fifi, said 
Reed was talking almost nonstop and had trouble sticking to one subject. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wanted to talk and talk and talk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the subjects of his ramblings were unusual, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, he is very concerned that he has lost the suntan he had four 
years ago," she said. 
</P>
<P>
His appearance on the balcony had been preceded by 45 minutes of suntanning on 
the hospital roof. 
</P>
<P>
When they were finally reunited at the hospital Tuesday, Fifi Reed said, they 
embraced, both so overcome with emotion that they could not speak. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hugged in complete silence . . . just hugging, hugging, hugging," she 
said. "Then he started breaking up. He cried. He broke down and cried." 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband told her he was kept blindfolded and bound for most of the 
time of his captivity. For about 90 minutes during the evenings, he was allowed 
to watch television or read magazines or books but he refused, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"These things were so trivial compared to the things that were snatched away," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with NBC's "Today" show, she was asked if her husband felt 
anger at his captors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say," she replied. "I mean, he's angry at everybody right now." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if that included U.S. officials, she replied: "He didn't specify that. He 
just said, everybody."

In Washington, U.S. officials scurried Wednesday to prevent Reed from appearing 
on television shows to discuss his captivity, the condition of other hostages 
and his anger that they have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
Reed initially overruled advice from the American team in Wiesbaden to hold off 
on interviews, but they later convinced him that it was not in the interest of 
the remaining six Americans that he discuss their situation extensively. 
</P>
<P>
The former hostage has demonstrated a remarkable appetite and interest in food 
since his release. 
</P>
<P>
His first request at the hospital Tuesday was a big steak, medium rare, and a 
beer. Later that night, he dined on fried chicken, apple pie and ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
He awoke Wednesday morning and ordered a breakfast of steak, bacon, potatoes 
and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said one of the first things he plans to do when he returns home to his 
native New England is gorge on a "giant Maine lobster, at least three pounds."

Stanford University's intellectual atmosphere is calm again. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of violent storms over its revision of the curriculum for 
freshmen, during which former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett and the 
editorial page of the Wall Street Journal repeatedly hurled ideological 
lightning bolts at this rich and placidly beautiful university, the rhetorical 
cold front has passed through. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy arose over the introductory courses known collectively to older 
alumni as "Western Civilization" and more recently as "Western Culture." Such 
courses are an attempt, common to many American universities since World War I, 
to explain to incoming students the assumptions of their intellectual and moral 
heritage and, sometimes, to question those assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's effort -- catalyzed by the protests of minority students -- was to 
broaden the courses to include writings from "women, minorities and persons of 
color" and, incidentally, Americans, none of which had been on the reading 
lists. It stirred, first on the campus, then in the nation, a tempestuous 
debate over the very meaning of civilization and culture in the United States 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Now the freshmen -- currently 1,565 of them -- for whom the changes were 
designed are finishing the first year of the revised curriculum. And though the 
heavy weather has passed, a look into classrooms and faculty offices shows 
signs both of intellectual satisfaction and of continuing intellectual ferment. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, the Journal editorial page staff and others on the political and 
cultural right had accused Stanford of undermining Western civilization and 
culture in a return to the "discredited" radicalism of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Experience even in the communist world has stilled the dreams of the 1960s, 
but at least one place continues to revere them -- the ivory foxhole known as 
the American academy," the Journal said in an editorial of Dec. 22, 1988. "A 
good example is Stanford University, which earlier this year caved in to 
political pressure and cashiered its popular 'Western Culture' course 
requirement for freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the changes replied that Stanford was merely trying to prepare 
its students to understand and cope with the rapidly changing America and world 
they were growing up into. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford is trying seriously to consider how one should teach not only in the 
United States but particularly in California," said Keith Baker, an 
intellectual historian at the school. "Universities exist to raise serious 
questions, critical questions, about our cultural heritage -- what it is and 
how to teach about it. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems with American culture is that students bring together a 
whole lot of assumptions, without knowing how those assumptions have been 
created and how there are tensions between them. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford is saying this is a multicultural society, we live in a multicultural 
world. How do we best make sense of it for students? How do we best prepare 
students to live in a multicultural world?" 
</P>
<P>
At one level, the debate could be seen as an intra-faculty, inter-departmental 
struggle for students. (More students = more faculty = more prestige.) At 
another, it could be viewed as just another setting of the neo-conservatives' 
running morality play, in which they delight in attacking "relativists" 
wherever they think they have found them. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on another level, some participants in the debate agreed, the question 
Stanford was trying to confront was that put by J. Hector St. John Crevecoeur 
in his "Letters from An American Farmer" (1782): "What, then, is the American, 
this new man?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise Adopted 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, the Faculty Senate, after rejecting proposals for more 
sweeping changes, adopted a compromise to add works by women and writers from 
previously unrepresented ethnic groups to seven of the standard introductory 
courses and to create a robustly unorthodox new course, "Europe and the 
Americas," to introduce freshmen to the experiences of their world in a 
non-traditional way. The eight courses together were named "Cultures, Ideas, 
and Values," promptly nicknamed "CIV." 
</P>
<P>
Late in the winter quarter of this year the freshmen were nearing the end of 
the second of the three 10-week sessions in CIV that constitute, for students 
in the humanities, the introduction to the intellectual experiences of the rest 
of their Stanford years, and for many of the students in science and 
engineering the heart of their non-science education here. 
</P>
<P>
The green, expansive campus was drenched by the sun under a luminous blue sky, 
though it had been unseasonably cold after a heavy rain. The raucous scrapping 
of the scrub jays in the live oak trees challenged the whir of passing bicycles 
for the loudest noise on campus. Students moved from class to class among the 
famous low sandstone buildings of the Main Quadrangle. 
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Church and many of the more than 400 Neo-Romanesque arches of the 
building porches and their connecting cloister walkways had been shored up 
after damage from the Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake. The quake closed 
the church, the Stanford Museum, and many other buildings, and caused, in all, 
$160 million in damage. Professors had been doubled up in offices; some classes 
were meeting in smaller rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In one of them one afternoon, 18 freshmen from the "Europe and the Americas" 
course were talking with their instructor, Debbie Gordon, about "Uncle Tom's 
Cabin." They had just read selections from Alexis de Toqueville's "Democracy in 
America"; they would next read Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness." This is the 
course that drew most of the fire from outside. It proceeds more by 
juxtaposition of texts than by chronological exposition. It includes not only 
readings from the Bible and St. Augustine's "Confessions" but also such works 
as Frantz Fanon's "The Wretched of the Earth," Virginia Woolf's "A Room of 
One's Own" and Chinua Achebe's "Things Fall Apart." 
</P>
<P>
The instructor went around the room asking each student in turn to talk about 
"Uncle Tom's Cabin." She had been somewhat apprehensive, for its subject -- 
slavery -- might, she thought, make some of the students, especially the 
blacks, uneasy. The question of race and color is not abstract at Stanford. For 
the last decade and more the school, which always accepted both women and men, 
has been making a strenuous effort to recruit minorities, and now the freshman 
class is more than one-third minority -- 18.1% Asian, 8.3% Latino, 8.4% black. 
But the discussion seemed both matter-of-fact and engaged. 
</P>
<P>
"Religion's never been a part of my life, so it was interesting to see how 
Christianity helped Tom survive," a white male student said. 
</P>
<P>
A black woman discussed at some length how the whites in the old South were 
utterly dependent upon their black slaves. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was ironic that the slaves were true Christians, yet the whites 
used Christianity to justify slavery," said another young man, also a member of 
an ethnic minority. 
</P>
<P>
The instructor noted that the author, Harriet Beecher Stowe, wrote about the 
way the "institutionalized racism" exploited blacks for economic gain, yet many 
whites were shown as loving the blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost as if slaves were pets," said a white male in a tone of wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what does that say about that kind of power?" the instructor asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It says, 'I'm doing what's best for you because you don't know what's best for 
yourself,' " replied a black male. 
</P>
<P>
A white male observed that he thought for the longest time that Stowe was 
black. "It seemed weird a white woman would have the guts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion ranged for an hour and a half. Debbie Gordon brought in such 
topics as regionalism in American culture, religion as an instrument of both 
oppression and liberation, the importance of the concept of self-worth in a 
society as mobile as the American. The dialogue moved easily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incoming Students 
</P>
<P>
Stanford is one of the most selective schools in the country. Its freshmen 
arrive with wildly varying degrees of sophistication and education, but it is 
safe to say they are all bright. 
</P>
<P>
"What distinguishes these students," said Mary Weisling, an instructor in the 
CIV history course who has taught elsewhere, "is that they know how to use 
their time. They usually have a specific goal in mind. They find a way to keep 
integrating their experiences. They arrive here knowing they should keep their 
appointments. At UC Berkeley, for instance, they are no less bright, but a lot 
of them in the first quarter of their freshman year don't keep their 
appointments." 
</P>
<P>
The following week a different group of students from the "Europe and the 
Americas" course was discussing, with Debbie Gordon, "Heart of Darkness." Half 
the students had read the book in high school English classes, where it was 
generally presented as a parable of a voyage into the soul's interior. Here the 
students were asked to look at it as a tale of imperialism and, indeed, racism, 
the exploitation by Belgium of the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not necessarily one way to read a book," said the instructor. Which 
is the challenge that "Europe and the Americas" presents to conventional 
American methods of teaching an introduction to culture and civilization. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Culture and Truth," one of the founders of the course, 
anthropology professor Renato Rosaldo from Tucson High School and Harvard 
College, wrote: ". . . Work in cultural studies sees human worlds as 
constructed through historical and political processes, and not as brute 
timeless facts of nature. It is marvelously easy to confuse 'our local culture' 
with 'universal human nature.' " 
</P>
<P>
Or, as his co-founder, Mary Louise Pratt, professor of Spanish and Portuguese, 
put it: 
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely don't believe in the superiority of Western culture. We don't 
believe that the academy should exclude the critique of the West. Is not 
Western civilization itself (in its several stages of development) a critique 
of the West?" 
</P>
<P>
"I am very committed," she said, "to getting people to think relationally about 
Western culture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primary Sources 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many colleges, which habitually use narrative survey textbooks in 
introductory courses in "Western Civilization" or "World Culture" or the like, 
Stanford insists upon teaching in these courses from primary sources. So when 
it became known to the outside world that Stanford was thinking of changing the 
required reading list for freshmen, the dispute arose over which list of books 
should be the approved "canon" of texts that all educated Americans should 
know, or indeed whether there is such a canon. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1988 editorial, titled derisively "The Stanford Mind," the Wall Street 
Journal attacked "Europe and the Americas" as riding "the main hobbyhorses of 
today's political left -- race, gender and class. The West is perceived not 
through the evolution of such ideas as faith and justice, but through the prism 
of sexism, racism and the faults of its ruling class." The Journal invoked the 
name of Allan Bloom, author of "The Closing of the American Mind," as lamenting 
"the political conformity that now prevails throughout the American academy in 
the name of a fraudulent 'diversity.' " 
</P>
<P>
"As the West is 'phased out' in Palo Alto," the Journal concluded, "it's clear 
enough what's happening to Stanford's mind." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the West was not being "phased out" at Stanford. In addition to 
"Europe andthe Americas," which this year has about 100 students, the other 
seven CIV courses offered to freshmen remained much as they were: literature 
and the arts, great works, history, Western thought and literature, structured 
liberal education, philosophy and Western thought and technology. 
</P>
<P>
All eight courses have in common these readings: the Hebrew and the Christian 
Bible, a classical Greek philosopher, an early Christian thinker, a Renaissance 
dramatist and Karl Marx. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous "Western Culture" survey there had been 15 readings in common, 
including Homer, Machiavelli, Galileo, Voltaire and Freud, with others 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"This is regressive," Education Secretary Bennett said of the changes. "What 
are they doing?" 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the seven continuing courses teach pretty much what they taught 
before, with additions, such as readings from the Koran or "Equiano's Travels," 
the autobiography, greatly popular in the 18th Century, of Olaudah Equiano, the 
former slave captured in Africa; or Mary Wollstonecraft's "A Vindication of the 
Rights of Woman" (1792). 
</P>
<P>
The 15 works in the previous "Western Culture" courses were not, in fact, a 
carefully thought-out "canon," but at least partly a list arrived at through 
faculty horse-trading. The various humanities departments that teach these 
basic courses each strove to use them as introductions, or lures, to bring 
students as majors into their departments. And professors here as elsewhere 
tend to prefer to teach what they know best. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Love and Duty 
</P>
<P>
Only a small number of professors, nearly all of them from the humanities, 
teach these freshman survey courses. As it is, most of the professors who 
taught the previous courses are teaching them in their slightly revised 
versions. There is no career advantage or monetary gain to be had in teaching 
the freshman surveys. Those who do it, do it for love or duty. It is hard, 
because one must simplify and generalize. One can take intelligence for granted 
in the students, but not knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The professors are assisted by teachers like Debbie Gordon and Mary Weisling, 
who are hired from the outside to conduct the smaller sessions of discussion 
that are intended to illuminate and amplify the professors' lectures. For all 
its wealth, Stanford does not have, in its humanities departments, enough 
younger instructors to do this job. 
</P>
<P>
Shortage of faculty, and of money, stand in the way of creating new, 
experimentalcourses for the CIV series. The expenses created by the earthquake, 
constraints on increases in tuition (which will be $20,210 with room and board 
next academic year) and federal government pressure to reduce the 
administrative payments given to universities for the federal grants they 
receive are squeezing Stanford. It has announced a 13% budget cut -- $22 
million from a $175-million annual base -- over the next 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Thomas A. Wasow, dean of undergraduate studies, said, "We have 
taken the first steps in what I hope will be widespread curricular reform. I 
see developing a multicultural curriculum as one of my goals." The Irvine 
Foundation has given Stanford $1 million to that end, he said. Stanford is 
looking for an Asian-American to teach about the Asian-American experience, and 
it is also seeking someone who can do the same for the African-American. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in curricular ferment," Stanford President Donald Kennedy said. It 
is good to "fumigate the catalogue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Is Stanford undergoing these changes for moral or practical reasons, or for 
both? 
</P>
<P>
"For myself, practical, in the sense that I want Stanford students ready for 
the world as it will be, not as some would like it to remain," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Good High School 
</P>
<P>
In 1959 James Bryant Conant, former president of Harvard University and former 
U.S. ambassador to West Germany, undertook a survey of American high schools 
for the Carnegie Corp. When it was over and published, he said there was one 
sure-fire way of telling a good high school: 
</P>
<P>
"It's where the teachers are excited about doing something new. It doesn't 
really matter what it is, as long as it's new and the teachers are interested." 
</P>
<P>
His remark applies to Stanford, notably to "Europe and the Americas." It scored 
highest of all the tracks in the students' evaluation when it was introduced 
last year. No student questioned for this article found much fault in it, and 
many were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to be a very concrete thinker. 'Europe and the Americas' helps me 
stretch my mind. The students in this course are very excited about it," said 
Bridget Kaman, who came to Stanford from St. Charles (Ill.) High School. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're studying is like what graduate students are studying," added Casey 
Lynch of Atherton, from Sacred Heart High School in Menlo Park. She was 
referring to what Renato Rosaldo likes to call the "juxtaposition of texts," 
the reading of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," for instance, right after "Democracy in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
"Juxtaposing texts is like juxtaposing colors," Rosaldo had said. "They both 
change by the juxtaposition." 
</P>
<P>
Marya Gilborn of Hunter College High School in New York City said she had taken 
courses in the "great books" and philosophy in high school and liked the 
Stanford course because "I was frustrated by philosophical theory . . . 
studying the origins of justice doesn't seem too important to me as seeing how 
it actually works." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell Mathewson of Lake Washington High School in Seattle said he was 
fascinated by the different points of view brought out by the books they were 
reading and the comments on them from his fellow freshmen of different colors 
and backgrounds, but thought "the origins of justice is important." He 
regretted missing the traditionally taught "great books" and would go back and 
read them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initial Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Which is just the point made by Ronald A. Rebholz, a popular professor of 
English who chairs the "great works" course in CIV and opposed the changes when 
they were made. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like 'Europe and the Americas,' " he said. "It really does slight the 
ancient and medieval worlds to the point where the students are going to be 
ignorant of their cultural and intellectual heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Rebholz was impressed, however, by the reports of student enthusiasm for the 
course. "It's not easy to get freshmen seriously engaged with things," he said. 
"Their lives are so hectic." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the changes, he added to his own course "The Conference of the 
Birds," by Farid ud-Din Attar, a work of medieval Islamic mysticism. "It is 
stunningly beautiful," he said, "and a great addition to the course. I have 
learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Coope, one of the instructors in the CIV history course, last fall gave 
as one of the new elements in it a lecture on Islamic and Jewish influences on 
Europe. "We got a sense of the tragedy of the destruction of culture," said her 
colleague Mary Weisling. "The students were terribly affected." 
</P>
<P>
"The Stanford students know (because of their diversity) that a sense of the 
values in each culture is so important," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the minority students whose protests helped push the curriculum changes 
to the forefront of the Stanford agenda have graduated. For the moment the 
leaders of the various student minority groups are watching the changes and 
seem to be reasonably content with them. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Minor, a sophomore from Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia and 
co-chairman of the Black Student Union's education rights committee, which was 
the spearhead of the student protest, said that "Stanford has made a commitment 
to multicultural education, and that is fantastic, but the students have to 
keep pushing." 
</P>
<P>
Kennell Jackson, a professor of history lecturing in "Europe and the Americas," 
had said that until recently the black students here had not had a sense of 
"ownership." Do you feel at home here? Minor was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time I do; sometimes it's very frustrating," she said. "The real 
challenge here is to hold your roots to reality, to remember where you came 
from. It's very beautiful here. It's very easy to become complacent." 
</P>
<P>
Minor wants to "work with people, hopefully in service to the black community. 
You know, lots of people have families at 19." She is thinking about going into 
high school teaching. The leaders of most American universities keep pressing 
on their students the worthiness of public service, even as many students are 
relentlessly careerist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Revolution' 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the debate, one of Stanford's luminaries in the humanities, 
history professor emeritus Gordon A. Craig, tolerantly observed that "these 
educational reforms take place every 15 years or so." Craig, a specialist in 
German history and author of "The Germans," was one of the founders of the 
replaced "Western Culture." He and others started it in 1980 because, after its 
predecessor had been thrown out in 1969 in what some teachers call simply "the 
revolution," students needed to know who and where they were. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have any chronological sense. They didn't know whether Jesus or 
Bismarck came first," said Craig (who, with his modified mutton-chop whiskers, 
looks not unlike Bismarck). 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who was reading the Roman poet Tibullus in Latin when his interviewer 
arrived, said he thought "Western Culture" should have been retained, with 
other courses on other cultures, which were essential, added to it. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get down to it, the mainstream of culture (that fed American 
civilization) came from the West," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The matter would be put slightly differently, perhaps, by his next-door office 
neighbor, Keith Baker, the intellectual historian, who came this year from the 
University of Chicago and is teaching the history CIV course, of which his 
history colleague Paul A. Robinson said, "This is the CIV program at its best." 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow Stanford was seen to be caving in to all these forces that seemed to 
some to be overwhelming American values," Baker said. "It wasn't doing that at 
all; it was asking crucial questions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's terribly important to convey to students the way the world -- their world 
-- has been created. It represents human choices, human imagination, human 
conflict. Any introductory course has to do that, because students take so much 
for granted. You have to show them those assumptions haven't always been there, 
that they have been created, and could have been otherwise."

S. AFRICA, ANC LEADERS START HISTORIC TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CAPE TOWN, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in its 78-year history, the African National Congress 
formally sat down Wednesday with South Africa's white rulers, beginning three 
days of talks aimed at removing obstacles to black-white negotiations over 
dismantling apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk and ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, 
standing side by side with their delegations intermingled behind them, opened 
the historic discussions on a note of optimism, saying they were taking the 
first steps toward restructuring South African society. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of South Africans are opposed to violence, to conflict, to 
intimidation and are reaching out for peaceful and just solutions," De Klerk 
said in welcoming the ANC leaders to the lush grounds of Groote Schuur, the 
330-year-old former home of South African prime ministers and site of the 
talks. "Confrontation will get us nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the meetings must decisively repudiate "the terrible tradition of 
a 'dialogue' between master and servant" and begin to replace it with 
"peaceful, democratic and genuine debate, discussion and negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
"The black masses of our country demand and expect fundamental change now and 
not tomorrow," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, for the first time in public, the recently freed ANC leader switched 
briefly into Afrikaans, the first language of De Klerk's team and of South 
Africa's conservative white Afrikaners. 
</P>
<P>
"To the white community, including the Afrikaners, we say you have nothing to 
fear from the ANC," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
The first session adjourned Wednesday night after four hours of discussions 
"characterized by openness and straightforwardness on both sides," the 
government and the ANC said in a joint statement. Both sides presented what 
each viewed as the primary hurdles to negotiations and agreed to resume 
discussions this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of the eight Afrikaner men from the government standing on the 
heavily guarded estate next to 11 ANC supporters, including five of the most 
notorious figures once in exile, left both government and ANC aides shaking 
their heads in amazement. And it was featured prominently on state-run 
television's evening newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had told me six months ago that the ANC and the government would be 
standing together here today, I'd have said, 'Not in my lifetime,' " said Caro 
Hoon, an aide to one of the Cabinet ministers involved in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Before the talks began, De Klerk and Mandela, who have met three times 
previously, appeared at ease as they addressed reporters gathered outside the 
Cape Dutch-style house at the foot of Devil's Peak. After De Klerk's remarks, 
Mandela turned to the president and said quietly, in Afrikaans, "Very good 
statement." De Klerk nodded his thanks and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Although the talks are only a first step toward more substantive negotiations, 
they mark a victory for the sweeping reforms that De Klerk launched exactly 
three months ago. In an attempt to lure blacks to the negotiating table, De 
Klerk unbanned the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups, lifted most 
restrictions on black political activity and released the 71-year-old Mandela 
and two others on the ANC's delegation after 27 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The closed-door talks, requested by the ANC, center on the obstacles still 
standing in the way of black-white negotiations for a new South African 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said his government will raise the problem of escalating unrest in the 
townships, which he blames on the ANC's refusal to formally abandon its 
30-year-old guerrilla war against Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, on the other hand, refuses to enter formal negotiations until De Klerk 
lifts the state of emergency that has curtailed many civil rights in the 
country for four years, releases about 2,000 political prisoners from South 
African jails and allows the ANC's 15,000 members in exile to return home 
without fear of prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk granted temporary immunity from prosecution to the five exiled ANC 
leaders attending this week's talks. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk says the ANC is only one of many groups, both black and white, that he 
is trying to bring into discussions about the country's future. And he said 
Wednesday that the government will "continue its discussion with other leaders 
and parties . . . to encourage negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
The president envisions a new constitution that would extend full voting rights 
to the 27 million blacks, provide political protection for the country's 5 
million whites and abolish the remaining vestiges of apartheid that still grant 
whites a life of privilege by creating segregated residential areas, schools 
and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
But the ANC, the most powerful opposition group in the country, wants the 
constitution to be drawn up by a constituent assembly elected in a one-person, 
one-vote election of all races. It also says it will reject any attempts to 
give whites veto power under a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's delegation to the talks includes six blacks, two people of 
mixed-race, two whites and one Indian. Among them are two of the key figures in 
the ANC's military wing in exile -- Joe Slovo, the white former chief of staff 
of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation) and leader of the South African 
Communist Party, and Joe Modise, the black commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe. 
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the ANC are under international pressure to reach a 
peaceful settlement. But they also face pressure from their own constituencies, 
which have seen increasing defections to left- and right-wing groups. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC is struggling to maintain its support among more radical young 
activists, many of whom want to maintain the "armed struggle" until the 
government ends apartheid and agrees to hand over power to leaders selected in 
a one-person, one-vote election. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk is trying to maintain the support of South Africa's more conservative 
whites, many of whom view the ANC with deep suspicion and fear that the 
government has put itself on a course that will result in black domination, 
just as successive white governments have dominated blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Many right-wing whites have begun arming themselves in recent weeks to prevent 
their property from what they believe will be a black takeover.

CALIFORNIANS WILLING TO PAY TO OVERHAUL HEALTH SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICAL CARE: GALLUP POLL FINDS 73% WOULD AGREE TO HIGHER TAXES TO PAY FOR 
SERVICES FOR THE POOR AND UNINSURED. 
</P>

<P>
Californians are prepared to accept and pay for a restructuring of the state's 
health-care system but fault government leaders for failing to initiate change, 
said sponsors of the fourth annual Gallup California Health Care Poll released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
While Californians remain firm in their opposition to health-care rationing and 
compromising the quality of care, 73% said they would agree to higher taxes -- 
an average of $43 per person, per month -- to pay for health care for the poor 
and uninsured, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
Respondents also expressed support for additional taxes on alcohol and taxing 
firearms to pay for indigent health care. But government leaders received low 
marks for their handling of problems in health-care access and financing. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is ready to make the hard choices in health care that their elected 
leaders are not," said pollster George Gallup. "The public favors concrete ways 
to meet the health needs of the poor and to improve the health-care delivery 
system, and apparently is willing to foot the bill." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll, an annual event co-sponsored by the California Assn. of 
Hospitals and Health Systems and the three Hospital Councils of California, 
questioned 1,004 Californians regarding health-care issues and personal-health 
habits. The Hospital Council of Southern California represents 84% of hospitals 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The responses reflected those expressed in a Los Angeles Times Poll conducted 
in January, which revealed Americans' willingness to pay higher taxes to expand 
health-care coverage and their belief that government should take the lead in 
improving the system. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gallup Poll, two-thirds said that poor people with no Medi-Cal coverage 
deserve more service. More than half said that government is paying too little 
to hospitals for poor people on Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"A significant proportion of Californians believe that health care is a right," 
said Robert Nielsen, senior vice president of the Gallup Organization. "They 
were very clear that some form of government ought to take care of it. Eighty 
percent of Californians said that government had a responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Half said they disapproved of the Legislature's performance on health-care 
issues, and 36% said they disapproved of Gov. George Deukmejian's performance, 
while 29% said they approved. 
</P>
<P>
"The major crisis in health care is a crisis in leadership," Nielsen said. 
"It's very clear what the general public wants, but it's not very clear who is 
going to assume the major burden and carry the political ball and make it 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
As in past years, a majority -- 61% -- opposed health-care rationing while 25% 
favored it. Under a rationing plan, services would be prioritized and those 
perceived of lowest priority would not be paid for. More than three-quarters 
said they would not be willing to accept a lower quality of health care even if 
it cost less. 
</P>
<P>
But, along with support for an increase in personal taxes, the poll revealed 
high interest in selective tax measures to pay for health care -- especially on 
products that are viewed as detrimental to health. The proposed 1990 California 
ballot initiative designed to cover some indigent health care costs by taxing 
alcohol drew a 79% approval response while 18% opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Increased traffic violation fines were also supported, although by a lower 
margin (57% to 39%). A majority favored a new proposal to tax firearms to pay 
for indigent health care (70% to 27%) but opposed sales tax increases (40% to 
57%). 
</P>
<P>
More than eight of 10 people favored the controversial proposal drafted by 
state health officials for employer-mandated health insurance, with 50% saying 
they "strongly agreed" that employers should be required to provide basic 
health insurance to their employees and another 34% saying they "agreed." 
</P>
<P>
"Business must be alerted to the finding that 84% of the public are saying that 
the employers should be the ones responsible for funding health care through 
employee benefits," said Stephen Gamble, president of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California. "Our health-insurance system in America is based upon 
employer-employee contributions to the pool to finance health care." 
</P>
<P>
Gamble said legislators traditionally have not viewed health care as an 
"election issue." But he predicted that public opinion will influence 
legislators to propose a major restructuring of the state's health-care system 
through a 1992 ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"By then we should have legislation passed to put on the ballot for a 
better-organized system for the financing and delivery of health care in 
California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found: 
</P>
<P>
Health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations gained 
popularity, with 29% of respondents enrolled in such programs compared to 19% 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution was cited most frequently (by 22%) as the state's greatest health 
threat, a result that mirrored last year's findings. AIDS was cited as the 
major health threat by 19%, and 11% pinpointed the cost of health care. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of women from 35 to 54 indicated that they were on a diet to lose 
weight in the last year. One-quarter of males said they dieted. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds said they exercised at least three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
More Californians said they had been tested for the AIDS virus -- 24% this year 
compared to 18% last year. Non-whites were much more likely to express concern 
about contracting the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Respondents appeared to favor personal control regarding right-to-die 
decisions. In response to the question, "Should terminally ill adults be 
allowed to end their own life or not?" three-quarters of Californians said yes 
and one-fifth said no. A majority, 86%, believed that a relative should be 
allowed to make a refusal-of-life-support decision. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgment of illegal drug use rose from 20% to 21% in 1990. Whites were 
more likely to have used illegal drugs than any other racial group (22%) 
compared to Latinos (21%), Asians (19%) and blacks (16%). Drug use rose with 
educational level.

FOSSILS OF NEW SPECIES ADD TO MYSTERY OF DEMISE OF DINOSAURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fossils of at least four new species of animals discovered in Wyoming cast 
doubt on the theory that comets colliding with the Earth killed off some 
dinosaurs 130 million years ago and all dinosaurs 65 million years later, a 
Colorado paleontologist said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new species include a 20-pound herbivorous dinosaur, a bizarre mammal that 
the researchers have nicknamed a "mutant ninja chipmunk" and a "high-tech" 
turtle. They flourished after the large dinosaurs that preceded them were 
exterminated 130 million years ago by an unknown environmental catastrophe, 
said Robert Bakker of the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers believe that cometary collisions produced highly acidic 
rainfall and cold temperatures that led to the dinosaurs' decline. But 
discoveries at the new site cast doubt on that proposal because other reptiles 
and fish, which should have been affected by the cold and acid, proliferated 
while the dinosaurs died out. 
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism (of extinction) obviously needs to be rethought," said Bakker, 
who is considered by many paleontologists to be a maverick in the profession. 
</P>
<P>
It is not widely appreciated that dinosaurs went through two distinct periods 
of dominance. During the late Jurassic Period, which extended up to 130 million 
years ago, the largest dinosaurs were well-known varieties such as the 
long-necked brontosaurus, the spike-backed stegosaurus and the fierce, 
carnivorous allosaurus. 
</P>
<P>
These species died off at the end of the Jurassic, to be replaced by small 
dinosaurs that evolved into the iguana-like iguanodons, the dome-headed 
dinosaurs and the largest land-based predator ever to exist, Tyrannosaurus rex 
-- all of which were wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This dramatic change in the evolutionary cast of characters (between the 
Jurassic and Cretaceous) is one of the most profound crises in dinosaur 
development," Bakker said. "The new fossils are the remains of animals that 
lived in a crisis interval during the early Cretaceous period, and this is the 
first rock layer (containing the fossils) that seems to record just what 
happened and why." 
</P>
<P>
That rock layer, known as the Breakfast Bench, lies in Wyoming's Albany County, 
near the town of Rock River. Bakker has been studying the site since 1974, but 
the bones obtained there, he said, "are so small that I misidentified them at 
first." It was only when he and his colleagues found an almost complete 
skeleton of a 20-pound dinosaur now called Drinker nisti "that I realized what 
we had been getting and the new species kind of jelled." 
</P>
<P>
The fossil bed indicates that the region was swampy and fern-choked at the end 
of the Jurassic. Similar conditions prevailed at the end of the Cretaceous and 
at the end of the Permian period 250 million years ago, when another extinction 
occurred before dinosaurs existed. Swamps have also been associated with other, 
smaller extinctions, Bakker said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we have a 'serial killer' here that has something to do with 
swamps," he said. "We're not ready for convictions yet, but we certainly have 
enough evidence for an indictment." He speculates that the dinosaurs were 
killed by disease as they moved into new environments in response to climate 
change. 
</P>
<P>
But, noted geologist Walter Alvarez of UC Berkeley, there is "overwhelming 
evidence" that a cometary impact did occur at the end of the Cretaceous period. 
"We may never know precisely what the killing mechanisms were, but it would 
require a breathtaking coincidence to say that a gigantic impact had nothing to 
do with a gigantic extinction," said Alvarez, a long-time proponent of the 
impact theory of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Paleobiologist Hans Sues of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of 
Natural History in Washington called Bakker's claim about a serial killer 
"wild," but noted that Bakker "does have a very interesting new dinosaur and 
little animals there." 
</P>
<P>
Bakker has been criticized in the past for making strong claims in the media 
and for not publishing his results in refereed journals. The current findings 
were published recently in the Proceedings of the Fourth North American 
Paleontological Congress, a non-refereed journal. The fact that a paper is 
unrefereed means that other scientists have not subjected it to critical 
review. 
</P>
<P>
The fossil strata also show that while large land animals died off, smaller 
aquatic species and reptiles did not. "If a meteorite hit, it would cause a 
sudden chill and acid rain that would kill off turtles and frogs right away," 
Bakker said. "But the frogs didn't disappear. Neither did the turtles. In fact, 
the whole aquatic ecosystem bloomed and did fine. That's a very powerful clue 
about what happened." Bakker is not sure, however, what caused the swamps to 
form. 
</P>
<P>
The most common dinosaur to be found at Breakfast Bench was the new D. nisti, 
he said. It was equipped with the most complicated leaf-cutting teeth ever to 
evolve among dinosaurs. The animal's large, spreadable hind feet were adapted 
to walking on soggy ground. 
</P>
<P>
Baby D. nisti specimens, with body and leg bones as small as pigeons', are 
among the smallest dinosaurs ever found, Bakker said. "You can put a pile of 
their bones on a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Zofiabaatar, a ferocious eight-ounce mammal, has been nicknamed the "mutant 
ninja chipmunk" by Bakker. The animal apparently killed lizards and other small 
prey with its mouse-like front teeth, then sliced up the bodies with its long, 
saw-edged rear teeth. 
</P>
<P>
It was a member of a group of mammals known as multituberculates -- primarily 
insect eaters and herbivores that have no relatives living today. "The mutant 
ninja chipmunk apparently made an evolutionary hard right turn" to become a 
carnivore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foxraptor was a furry, even smaller animal with a bulldog snout designed for 
attacking large bugs and small vertebrates. The fourth new species, Uluops, was 
a "high-tech" turtle boasting a skull architecture far more advanced that its 
contemporary cousins. 
</P>
<P>
The largest common animal in the Breakfast Bench strata was the "giant 
crushing-tooth lungfish," a half-ton predator with huge, flat teeth shaped like 
mittens for cracking hard-shelled prey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW SPECIES FOUND 
</P>
<P>
Colorado paleontologist Robert Bakker has discovered four new species that date 
from 130 million years ago. Two -- the Foxraptor and the Zofiabaatar -- are 
small but ferocious mammals. One -- the Uluops -- is a neurologically 
sophisticated turtle. The fourth -- the Drinker -- is a 20-pound plant-eating 
dinosaur.

PLAN WOULD GIVE HEALTH CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS

<P>
Legislation to create a universal system of tax-supported health care for every 
Californian was unveiled Wednesday by a Democratic state senator and a 
coalition of consumer and labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, the most far-reaching of several similar proposals made recently, 
calls for new payroll taxes on employers and their workers, a sales tax 
increase, and some new levies on the affluent. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, California companies would be freed from the responsibility of 
providing health care for their workers, and out-of-pocket medical costs to 
individuals would be capped at $250 a year. Most patients still would be able 
to choose their own doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the program would take the $50 billion that Californians already 
spend on health services each year and redirect that money in a more efficient 
way that would give everyone access to care. Critics complain that passage of 
the plan would mean an unprecedented and unworkable level of government 
interference in the private medical system. 
</P>
<P>
Although the concept enjoys wide public support, according to opinion polls, 
the odds are against its passage this year because legislative leaders and the 
governor are concentrating on a separate plan that would couple expanded 
employer-provided health benefits with increased subsidies from the state. 
Health care interests are also expected to oppose the concept vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
The universal care proposal, drafted by San Francisco-based Health Access and 
introduced in legislation by Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland), aims to 
provide insurance for more than 5 million Californians who lack it now while 
ending the health care cost spiral that more and more is a burden on the middle 
class and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vicious cycle: As more people fall into the ranks of the uninsured, the 
cost of caring for them is shifted to paying patients through increased 
insurance premiums. The higher premiums deprive still more people of coverage, 
and the cost to the rest of the population rises anew. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at a system that is broken and breaking more each year," said 
Judith Bell, a lobbyist for Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
In a Los Angeles Times poll conducted in January, 72% of those interviewed said 
they favored comprehensive national insurance. On average, the respondents said 
they would be willing to pay an additional $106 a year in taxes for universal 
insurance and $154 to pay for long-term nursing home care. A Gallup Poll of 
Californians released Wednesday found similar results, with 83% supporting the 
concept of a government-run insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Access plan would virtually end the indemnity insurance business, 
where insurance companies reimburse their customers directly for their 
out-of-pocket costs. But prepaid medical plans and health maintenance 
organizations, under which groups of doctors and hospitals agree to serve 
patients at negotiated rates, would continue to exist and could flourish. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that the government would be the insurer. In return for 
higher taxes -- a 10% payroll tax on employers, a 1% payroll tax on workers, 
and a sales tax increase of 1% or less -- the state would guarantee every 
citizen a generous set of benefits. Those would include preventive medicine, 
dental care for children and long-term care for the aged. A state commission 
with massive bargaining power would contract with private doctors and hospitals 
to provide the care. 
</P>
<P>
Poor people now using the state Medi-Cal system and the elderly who are 
enrolled in Medicare would also be part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
But Petris and the Health Access coalition may have to take a political back 
seat to Gov. George Deukmejian, Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San 
Francisco and Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno. Those three are 
working on two plans that would require most or all California employers to 
provide insurance for their workers while subsidizing the costs for small 
businesses and companies with low profits. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal, by Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), would impose an 
8% payroll tax on any employer that failed to provide insurance. The state 
would use money raised through the tax to buy coverage for those without it. 
</P>
<P>
The Petris bill, which may become a ballot initiative if it fails in the 
Legislature, would offer greater coverage to more people than any of the other 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only major bill that would provide universal and comprehensive 
health care for all Californians," said Karen Coker, a lobbyist for the County 
Supervisors Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
But doctors, hospitals and the insurance industry can be counted on to oppose 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in universal access, but this would be a monolithic, 
government-dominated system," said Duane Dauner, president of the Californian 
Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems. "We prefer a more pluralistic approach."

'JUDAS GOATS' HELP NAVY RID SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND OF BEASTS 
</P>

<P>
After 18 years of battling the formidable goats of San Clemente Island, the 
U.S. Navy says it is about to eradicate them for good by using a new program 
based on a simple premise: goats hate to be alone. 
</P>
<P>
Since last June, the Navy has put the goats' gregariousness to work, using 
seven "Judas goats" to seek out and infiltrate hard-to-find herds. Each Judas 
goat is fitted with a radio transmitter, so scientists can track and kill the 
sociable animals, whose grazing has threatened the ecology of the rocky island. 
When one herd is shot, the Judas goats are set loose to betray again. 
</P>
<P>
"We're exploiting goat behavior," said Dawn Seward, 25, a graduate student from 
Oregon State University who spends up to 10 hours a day tracking goats on the 
Navy-owned island about 60 miles off the San Diego coast. "Goats find goats 
better than humans find goats." 
</P>
<P>
So much better, in fact, that the Navy predicts that within a month, the island 
will be "goat-free" for the first time since the 1800s, when sheepherders 
introduced them. Since 1972, the Navy has struggled to solve the goat problem, 
killing or trapping 27,000 goats on the 57-square-mile island and suffering the 
ire of animal advocates. But now, only six wild goats are known to remain, and 
their dwindling numbers have allowed the recovery of seven endangered native 
plant and animal species that were nearly nibbled to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
"The island had a cancer and that cancer was the goats," said Jan Larson, 
natural resources manager for North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego, 
which uses San Clemente Island for bombing and shelling practice and 
touch-and-go landing drills. 
</P>
<P>
Larson credits the Judas goat program with giving the island's endangered 
species a real chance at survival. Already, four plant species appear to be on 
the rebound, and the island night lizard may soon be removed from the 
threatened species list. 
</P>
<P>
Larson also believes that the San Clemente Island experiment, modeled on a 
similar program in Hawaii, will yield valuable solutions to what he calls a 
"worldwide goat problem." From the Galapagos Islands to Madagascar to Santa 
Catalina, Larson said, oceanic islands suffer a continuing goat blight. In 
addition, he said, of all the plants on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 
endangered and rare species list, 29% owe their precarious position to goats. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the Judas goat program also promises to bring the Navy something 
it has dearly wanted for nearly two decades -- an end to the San Clemente 
Island goat controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, when the Navy began trying to restore the native ecology of the 
island by trapping 16,500 wild goats, animal rights activists have kept a close 
watch. Back then, Larson recalls, "the erosion was incredible. Tons of topsoil 
were leaving the island each year. The island was almost a powdery plain." 
Cactus, once a rarity, dominated the landscape. And from the air, the terrain 
appeared scarred, crisscrossed with thousands of "goat highways." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this environmental damage, when the Navy first proposed bringing 
sharpshooters in to eliminate the herd in 1979, conservationists balked. 
Cleveland Amory and the Fund for Animals got court injunctions to halt the 
eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure to meet the demands of the Endangered Species Act, the Navy 
sought an alternative to shooting. It hired a trapper who snared more than 
6,000 goats. But the remainder retreated beyond his reach into the steep, 
craggy canyons of the island's interior. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1985, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger intervened on behalf of 
the Fund for Animals, allowing it to conduct a goat rescue mission. The group 
brought in a helicopter netting team. Flying as low as 20 feet, the capture 
team dropped a net over three or four animals at a time, landed the aircraft, 
and then prepared the goats for shipping. In March of 1986, after netting more 
than 7,600 goats, the Fund for Animals reported it had "completed goat 
removal." 
</P>
<P>
But the organization was wrong. And soon the goats that remained were 
repopulating the island nearly as swiftly as they devoured it. Larson estimates 
that in 10 years, two goats can yield 5,000 descendants.

GERMANY'S ROLE UP TO NATO, BAKER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
REUNIFICATION: HE RULES OUT ANY VOICE FOR THE SOVIETS IN DECIDING IF THE UNITED 
COUNTRY WILL STAY IN THE WESTERN ALLIANCE.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday that the Soviet Union, 
despite its rights as a victorious power in World War II, has no authority to 
block a reunited Germany from membership in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said a meeting beginning Saturday among the foreign ministers of West and 
East Germany and the four victorious wartime Allies -- the United States, the 
Soviet Union, Britain and France -- has no power to decide matters that go 
beyond the status of Berlin and other issues left over from the postwar 
occupation of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Baker has sought to draw such a fine distinction on 
the scope of the upcoming negotiations, known as the "two-plus-four" talks. In 
the past, the U.S. government sought, without success, to persuade Moscow to 
agree to a reunited Germany being a NATO member. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state spoke to reporters aboard his Air Force jet while en 
route to Europe, where he will attend a NATO foreign ministers meeting here 
today before the two-plus-four session in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is up to a unified Germany and the other 15 members of NATO to 
decide matters affecting German membership in the alliance. At the same time, 
he said NATO has already begun to change from a primarily military alliance to 
a forum for political consultation, a step that may win the support of East 
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Moscow, De Maiziere said he would support German 
membership in NATO provided there were changes in the alliance's "structure and 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure I know the degree to which -- and how -- he thinks it should be 
transformed," Baker commented, but he added that a transformation is taking 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the agenda for today's meeting reflects NATO's "new political 
mission and greater political focus." He said the session will cover German 
reunification, European security matters, Lithuania and U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can get much more political than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-plus-four forum for German unification was launched last February. At 
that time, the six foreign ministers said in a joint communique that the 
meetings were intended to "discuss external aspects of the establishment of 
German unity, including the issues of security of the neighboring states." 
</P>
<P>
In his comments Wednesday, Baker said that the key word in the earlier 
statement was "discuss." He said the two-plus-four meeting can discuss 
everything but that it has very limited power to make binding decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of whether the unified Germany should be a member of NATO is a 
question that is properly decided in NATO, with the participation of the united 
Germany," Baker said. "The question of the extent and degree of future 
involvement of German forces is a matter that is not appropriately decided 
within the context of two-plus-four, but rather within the context of the 
(conventional forces in Europe) discussions in Vienna." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials earlier had expressed concern that Moscow's opposition to German 
membership in NATO could slow the reunification process. However, Baker said 
Wednesday that the Soviet role is limited to its rights as a postwar occupying 
power. Except for the continuing four-power role in Berlin, most of those 
rights were relinquished long ago by Moscow and its three Western wartime 
allies.

LITHUANIA MAKES NEW BID TO END CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
SECESSION: THE PRESIDENT OFFERS TO SUSPEND SOME MEASURES. LATVIA'S PARLIAMENT 
IS EXPECTED TO VOTE ON INDEPENDENCE.

<P>
Lithuania, bitten hard by Soviet sanctions that forced rationing of some 
foodstuffs beginning this week, made a new bid Wednesday to end the crisis 
through negotiations, calling on Western countries to serve as its 
intermediaries with the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lithuania's neighboring republic, Latvia, prepared for a 
parliamentary session that is expected to lead to a vote also proclaiming a 
restoration of the independence snuffed out when Josef Stalin forcibly took 
over the Baltic lands half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in the third Baltic republic, Estonia, have already voted for the 
eventual restoration of sovereignty. So Latvia's declaration, expected Friday, 
will confront Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with an entire region of 
about 9 million people legislatively on record as wanting to leave the Soviet 
Union -- and the worry that pro-independence sentiment will snowball elsewhere 
in this increasingly restive country. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister of breakaway Lithuania's government, Kazimiera Prunskiene, 
will call at the White House today for talks with President Bush. Bush last 
week decided not to impose sanctions for now to punish the Soviets for the way 
they have treated Lithuania since the republic's legislature voted March 11 to 
secede. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians have been dismayed and angered by the reluctance of Bush and 
other Western leaders to bolster them against Soviet pressure and intimidation 
to withdraw that declaration. But on Wednesday, President Vytautas Landsbergis, 
in a letter to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois 
Mitterrand, called on Western democracies to inform the Kremlin that Lithuania 
is ready to consider a "temporary suspension of the effects of decisions taken 
by the Parliament . . . which could bother Soviet authorities." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is negotiable save a questioning of the restored independence of 
the Lithuanian state on March 11, 1990," said the letter, made public by the 
republic's information service. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis was responding to a proposal from Kohl and Mitterrand that 
Lithuania suspend laws it passed to implement its independence declaration, in 
return for which the Kremlin presumably would agree to ease an economic embargo 
it imposed last month. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities had reacted favorably to the Kohl-Mitterrand proposal, but 
it was unclear whether Landsbergis' offer to place a moratorium on the new 
laws' operation would satisfy Gorbachev. The Soviet president has denounced the 
independence move as illegal and wants the independence proclamation itself 
frozen or suspended. The phrasing of Landsbergis' letter apparently did not 
include that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, food rationing went into effect in the republic of 3.8 million 
people, limiting the amount of sugar, noodles, margarine and some other 
foodstuffs that consumers can buy. Oil and gas deliveries from the Soviet 
Union, upon which Lithuania is totally dependent, also have been cut by the 
central government. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene, who was visiting Canada with a delegation to try to drum up trade 
before flying to the United States, said Tuesday in Toronto that she will ask 
Bush to try to persuade Gorbachev to end the economic blockade of her homeland. 
The superpower leaders are to hold a summit meeting in Washington beginning May 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Baltic port of Riga, the stage was being set for a bitter 
parliamentary battle over the re-establishment of Latvian independence. Many 
there are fearful that the action will draw the Kremlin's ire, as the 
Lithuanian secession vote did. 
</P>
<P>
"The example of Lithuania is plainly visible," Viktors Alksnis, a Latvian 
lawmaker in the Supreme Soviet, the Moscow-based national legislature, told an 
anti-independence rally in the Latvian capital this week. "They made a decision 
in haste, and suddenly now it becomes clear that the cost of independence is $1 
billion a year for oil." 
</P>
<P>
However, Sarmite Elerte, a spokeswoman for the pro-secession Latvian People's 
Front, said the independence proclamation that has been drafted, unlike 
Lithuania's, mandates a "transitional period" before complete local control is 
established or even claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"We all realize there is a difference between announcing independence and 
realizing it." 
</P>
<P>
That, and the fact Latvian leaders have already held talks with Gorbachev and 
Soviet officials about their goals and intent, are reasons they believe there 
will be no explosion of Moscow's fury. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian legislature is also supposed to vote on sending aid to Lithuania, 
but even People's Front leaders, whose candidates dominate the body, are 
uncertain that they can have their way on that. Deputies from the grass-roots 
group are a few seats shy of the two-thirds majority needed to pass such major 
legislation as the independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Although Latvian People's Front officials say they have lined up support from 
seven or eight other deputies -- enough, they say, to pass the laws -- they 
cannot guarantee it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes someone will say they will vote for something, but whether he does 
it or not is another question," Elerte said. 
</P>
<P>
Latvia's Parliament opens today, but it is not likely to tackle the 
independence issue before Friday. The initial hours of the session are expected 
to be taken up with choosing a credentials commission and secretariat, and 
election of the republic's president. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev wants independence-minded republics to secede by following steps 
mandated by a recently passed law that requires approval of two-thirds of the 
voters in the republic. The Latvians, however, like their Baltic neighbors, say 
they are not governed by those procedures, since their homelands were annexed 
by Moscow and never voluntarily joined the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In Latvia, however, demographics are a further reason for the Latvians to 
insist on other procedures. Latvia is the most heavily Russified of the Baltic 
republics, and ethnic Latvians barely form a majority of the 2.7 million 
inhabitants, with Russians counting for at least a third. So it is highly 
questionable whether pro-independence forces could muster a two-thirds majority 
at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
However, an unlikely source recently reported that independence seems to be 
backed by many non-Latvians. A survey in Latvia of about 25,000 residents found 
that 92% of the Latvians and 45% of the non-Latvians support the break, the 
Soviet newspaper Izvestia revealed last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's likely (that) many of the Russians and other ethnic groups who live here 
have come to believe that no change is likely and no improvement in their 
living standard possible as long as Latvia remains part of the Soviet Union," 
Elerte said.

The first Soviet congress of independent trade unions, in a challenge to the 
state labor movement, has voted to form a council to unite the country's 
unofficial workers' groups, a spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to unite all forces and to guarantee the rights of working people 
in this difficult economic situation," a spokesman said in Novokuznetsk, 
Siberia, where the congress was held. 
</P>
<P>
The congress passed resolutions supporting the breakaway republic of Lithuania 
and condemning the Soviet leadership for leading the economy to the brink of 
collapse. It also agreed to form an organization to defend the rights of rural 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day congress, which ended Wednesday, drew 140 delegates representing 
workers' clubs, strike committees and independent democratic groups from across 
the country.

ENVIRONMENTAL 'MARSHALL PLAN' PROPOSED TO COMBAT POLLUTION

An international group of legislators called for immediate action to curb 
"greenhouse" pollutants Wednesday and recommended enacting a "global Marshall 
plan" to help emerging countries cope with environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of a three-day conference on the environment, the delegates from 42 
countries urged that nations commit themselves without delay to reducing 
pollutants that they said could cause climatic temperatures to rise 50% in the 
next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Interparliamentary Conference on the Global Environment could offer little 
more than suggestions for an environmental game plan. Its recommendations are 
not binding on any country, but many delegates to the conference, sponsored by 
the U.S. Congress, said they would push for legislative action at home. 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive strategies on global warming suggested were not in line with the 
approach favored by President Bush and senior White House officials. Bush two 
weeks ago told an international environmental conference at the White House 
that further research must come before any commitment to specific 
anti-pollution measures. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 200 lawmakers at the conference agreed to a broad range of 
actions aimed at protecting the atmospheric ozone layer, reversing the loss of 
forests and committing greater resources to population control. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "global Marshall plan for sustainable development and the 
environment" would be patterned after the U.S. economic assistance effort that 
helped Europe recover from World War II, conference officials said.

subcommittee that Pierce -- although aware Gilliam was under investigation by 
HUD's inspector general -- nevertheless approved an expensive severance package 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, who has admitted taking bribes in connection with his work at the 
agency, also described how he diverted HUD funds to help a Kansas City Latino 
program after being pressured by staff members in then-Vice President George 
Bush's office. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam is serving an 18-month prison term for manipulating HUD grants. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the secretary the investigation was getting hot and I was going to 
leave, and that I might need some help," he told members of the House 
Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee, which is 
investigating HUD. "He said he would help me in any way he could." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said he asked Deborah Gore Dean, Pierce's executive assistant, if she 
could obtain approval from Pierce to give him control, after he left the 
agency, over 400 subsidized rental units designated for renovations under the 
Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
The designation he sought would have allowed Gilliam to award the units later 
to developers of his choice in return for consultant fees. The subcommittee has 
described the agreement as a kind of "gift certificate." 
</P>
<P>
"She talked to him and came back and said I could have 250 units," Gilliam 
said. "She said the secretary thought that by asking for 400, I was being 
greedy." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam estimated that the resulting consultant fees and tax benefits 
eventually would have provided him with $1 million to $2 million. "It would 
have given me a good start after leaving government," Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said that he thought he needed Pierce's approval because of the large 
number of units involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt if I'd gone in and asked Deborah for 10 or 15 units, she could have 
made that decision on her own," he said. "But because of the large number, I 
knew that type of decision had to be made by the secretary." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said, however, that he never received the units "because the (HUD 
inspector general's) investigation got hot." 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's subcommittee hearing, Paul L. Perito, Pierce's attorney, 
issued a statement denying "all allegations of wrongdoing and improper conduct" 
on the part of his client and attacking Gilliam's credibility as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
"It is inconceivable that this subcommittee has accepted at face value the 
unsubstantiated testimony of an admitted cheat and liar who repeatedly violated 
the public's trust while at HUD," Perito said. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce is the subject of a criminal investigation by independent counsel Arlin 
Adams, a former federal judge, to determine if he illegally favored Republican 
consultants in awarding multimillion-dollar contracts during his eight years as 
HUD secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, testifying under a grant of immunity from further federal prosecution, 
was the first former HUD official to contradict Pierce's sworn testimony that 
he generally did not involve himself in funding decisions and directed his 
subordinates to make awards based on merit. 
</P>
<P>
Two other former high-ranking department officials, Dean and Lance H. Wilson, 
have refused to appear before the subcommittee. Pierce, after his initial 
appearance before the panel last May, has refused to testify further on advice 
of his counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, who served in the HUD post from June, 1985, to September, 1987, said 
he helped divert funds for the Kansas City Latino project after being told that 
unidentified staff members in then-Vice President Bush's office wanted it 
financed. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said the funds were sought by Hector Barreto, then president of the 
U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, to study the feasibility of building a 
Latino trade center. He said he initially told Barreto the project was 
ineligible for funding under rules governing grants from the secretary's 
discretionary fund for special projects. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Gilliam said, "he (Barreto) told me that he'd had a meeting in the vice 
president's office." A short while later, he said, Dean called him and 
"indicated to me that she'd received a call from the vice president's staff and 
they wanted to get the project funded." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said Barreto again visited him, and "I assured him we'd work it out." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, he asked a Kansas City assistant city manager to provide 
the money from the city's Community Development Block Grant funds, another HUD 
program. Gilliam said he arranged to replace that money with funds from the 
discretionary fund. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked Wednesday whether Bush's office 
interceded on Barreto's behalf when Bush was vice president, replied: "I don't 
know. I've never heard of Hector Barreto." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, whose credibility has been under attack, insisted that he has been 
telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here under oath," he said. "I've been granted immunity. I have no reason 
to lie." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the subcommittee, noting that 
Gilliam is due for parole and that he will be released from prison shortly, 
said there was no incentive for Gilliam to perjure himself before the panel and 
"spend several more years in prison."

THORNBURGH DECRIES YOUTH VIOLENCE, URGES COURTS TO GET TOUGH 
</P>

<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, citing a rising rate of violent acts committed by 
youths, said Wednesday that juvenile justice systems must be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
"To a remarkable extent," juvenile and family courts "have kept crime a family 
secret," Thornburgh told the New Mexico Council on Crime and Delinquency in his 
first comments on youthful crime since he became the nation's top law 
enforcement official. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the secrecy surrounding juvenile court proceedings is designed to 
avoid stamping adults as suspect because of mistakes made in their youth. 
</P>
<P>
"That is less and less to be tolerated by American society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A problem adolescence -- even of the most desperate nature -- is no longer 
seen as mitigation of culpability." 
</P>
<P>
He coupled his call for a crackdown on violent young criminals with a plea that 
athletes, entertainers, government officials and others in the public eye 
behave as role models for young people in the face of the disintegrating family 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that not just new laws -- nor more regulations, nor further court 
decisions -- will do the job alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the family is intact, the parent is the role model, Thornburgh said. 
"But, too often, the family exists within a deteriorating social fabric and has 
even abdicated its child-rearing responsibilities altogether," so that others 
must serve as good examples. 
</P>
<P>
"Too often," he went on, "responsibility is avoided or irresponsibility openly 
flaunted" by public figures "whose values are communicated to young people 
through the omnipresence of television." 
</P>
<P>
He cited as examples "entertainers who make light of -- or even glorify -- the 
use of drugs or the illegitimacy of their offspring" and an athlete who 
justifies cocaine use by saying it's "only in the off season." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh also pointed to government officials who preach, but don't practice, 
honesty in public office, and "business and financial leaders whose pursuit of 
greed and avarice trashes the positive values of the honest marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
As a federal official, Thornburgh has little direct authority over juvenile 
justice. State and local jurisdictions are primarily responsible, but he was 
clearly attempting to use his office to help chart a change of course to meet 
"the gravity of the situation" of mounting violence among youths. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that too many children face "untenable social entrapment," as 
they are being reared in conditions close to nihilism. He pointed to recent 
findings by the National Commission on Children that one of every five American 
children grows up in a household where income is below the "poverty line." A 
white child born in the last 10 years has only a 30% chance of finishing high 
school while living at home with both parents. That chance is 6% for a black 
child, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What chance does such a child have -- given the weakness of the family 
structure, and, often, the pervasiveness of the drug culture, under these 
unhappy conditions -- to become a law-abiding citizen?" Thornburgh asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing grave endangerment of America's children -- those who will soon 
become America -- and we must do all in our power to come to their rescue," the 
attorney general said .

POLICE PATROL INDIAN RESERVATION AFTER SLAYINGS; 
</P>
<P>
MOHAWKS: CUOMO REFUSES TO SEND IN TROOPS. A KEY AIDE WILL MEET WITH TRIBAL 
LEADERS AND CANADIAN OFFICIALS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York State Police Wednesday patrolled a Mohawk Indian reservation which 
officers had sealed off Tuesday night after a weeklong spree of intra-tribal 
violence claimed two lives and left untold thousands of dollars in property 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo also dispatched a top-level aide to meet with 
Canadian authorities and tribal leaders at the St. Regis-Akwesasne Indian 
Reservation, which straddles the U.S.-Canadian border about 60 miles southwest 
of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
But Cuomo declined to send National Guard troops to the reservation, where 
armed Mohawks have clashed over the operation of half a dozen illegal gambling 
casinos on tribal land. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not send military force because of the risk of bloodshed, because of 
what it would provoke," Cuomo told reporters at the state Capitol in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
However, prompted by the slaying of two Indians on Tuesday, hundreds of New 
York state police entered the reservation. They permitted residents to leave 
but not to re-enter. 
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and Canadian authorities described the scene Wednesday as quiet, in 
sharp contrast to the picture in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Indians opposed to gambling set up roadblocks to turn back an 
estimated 15,000 weekly casino patrons, bringing to a head a dispute that has 
raged for months on the 28,000-acre reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The casinos employ more than 600 workers and reap millions of dollars in 
profits for the casino owners and investors, but anti-gambling factions contend 
that they encourage drugs and prostitution and corrupt the traditional Mohawk 
way of life. 
</P>
<P>
In erecting the roadblocks, the anti-gambling forces demanded that leaders of 
the 14,000-member reservation deal squarely with the gambling issue and with 
the so-called Mohawk Sovereignty Security Force, or Warriors Society as the 
group is more commonly known. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors Society is a self-appointed band of about 500-600 heavily armed 
Mohawks who see themselves as protectors of what they call the reservation's 
sovereign rights. Gambling opponents, however, describe them as a "goon squad" 
employed by casino owners to protect pro-gambling interests. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the roadblocks went up, pro-gambling forces, many armed with 
AK-47 assault rifles, tore the road barricades down in a hail of gunfire. 
Fighting continued for days between the feuding factions, with thousands of 
rounds of ammunition fired, cars and homes burned and, in one instance, a hand 
grenade lobbed at a Mohawk police station, injuring three people. 
</P>
<P>
The two men killed Tuesday were the first fatalities in the dispute. The dead 
were identified as Matthew Pyke, 22, a gambling opponent who reportedly was 
shot in the back by sniper fire, and Howard J. Evans, 33, a pro-gambling 
advocate. Both were slain on the Quebec side of the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec authorities said Wednesday they were investigating the deaths, but had 
made no arrests and had no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
As shotgun-carrying state police took up positions, police spokesman Sgt. 
Michael Downs said: "It seems like both factions are totally exhausted" by the 
fighting. He characterized the police presence as "like a relief valve. At 
least now there's a third party they can turn to and maintain stability." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Barnes, spokeswoman for the anti-gambling faction, welcomed the police. 
"People here have no peace of mind. As soon as the police leave, the shots will 
start again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Diane Lazores, a spokeswoman for the Warrior Society said: "We've got an 
armed invasion. If they want an international incident, they're going to get 
one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Young Mohawk children waited for their school bus beside armed state troopers, 
while many other Mohawks of all ages stayed at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not venturing out," reservation resident Jack Hubert, a recent retiree, 
told the Associated Press. "I don't want to spend my golden years being shot 
at." 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo's emissary to the reservation was Henrik N. Dullea, the governor's chief 
adviser on state operations and policy. Dullea "will be prepared to initiate 
formal negotiations next week" with Mohawk tribal leaders in an effort to 
resolve the longstanding gambling controversy, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 Mohawks, mostly women, children and elderly people from the 
Canadian side of the reservation -- the stronghold of anti-gambling sentiment 
-- had been evacuated earlier to the Transport Canada Training Centre in 
Cornwall, a small town north of the reservation across the St. Lawrence River. 
</P>
<P>
The gaming houses, which are stretched out along a 2 1/2-mile strip on the 
American side of the reservation, are illegal under federal laws because they 
do not have the sanction of the state. Pro-gambling forces ignore the law, 
however, contending that the reservation is sovereign Indian territory subject 
only to tribal law. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents and New York state police have staged several raids on the casinos, 
confiscating gaming machines, records and money. Casino operators also have 
been arrested and tried in court, but have stayed out of prison pending appeal 
of their convictions, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"They contend they're immune from New York state and other laws because they're 
a sovereign nation," said state police spokesman Downs. "So they just go back 
and reopen the casinos." 
</P>
<P>
Jurisdiction over the reservation presents a vexing problem for authorities 
because it covers territory in two different countries -- the United States and 
Canada -- and three different states and provinces -- New York, Quebec and 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Government on the reservation itself is just as vexing because the American 
side and the Canadian side each has its own elected council, headed by a grand 
chief. There also is a hereditary council that seeks to govern in traditional 
Mohawk fashion.

<P>
PRESS CALLS FOR CAMPAIGN AGAINST FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
State insurance commissioner candidate Bill Press, under fire for taking 
contributions from attorneys who advertise to represent accident claimants 
against insurance companies, proposed Wednesday a sweeping anti-fraud campaign 
by the state Insurance Department against "corrupt attorneys and doctors." 
</P>
<P>
Calling Los Angeles "the automobile accident insurance fraud capital of the 
United States," Press, a Democrat, estimated that the auto insurers statewide 
are losing $1.5 billion a year to fraud, including staged accidents and false 
medical bills and legal claims. This is more than 10% of annual auto insurance 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
He called for increasing the number of fraud investigators in the Insurance 
Department from the current 25 to 200, enacting legislation to take away 
licenses to practice law or medicine from any lawyer or doctor convicted of 
insurance fraud, and requiring insurers to fight harder against fraud. The 
costs of the crackdown under Press' plan would be paid by assessments against 
the companies. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from other candidates in the race varied, some saying that they had 
been advocating similar crackdowns all along and that Press is trying to have 
it both ways, financing his campaign from sources suspected of abetting fraud 
and then urging a crackdown against it. One other candidate was noncomittal and 
one opposed Press' anti-fraud approach. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), called Press' proposal "nearly 
identical to proposals that I have made repeatedly over the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to see his interest in this matter," he said. "But I'm curious 
about his commitment to rooting out fraud, considering that he is apparently 
taking money from insurance mills, or relying heavily on insurance mills for 
financing his campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Insurance mills is a pejorative name for teams of lawyers, doctors and 
chiropractors who are accused of encouraging clients to build up claims against 
insurers, so as to win large settlements for the clients, out of which they 
take a large percentage in fees. 
</P>
<P>
"My first reaction is, he stole the entire idea from me," said Democrat Ray 
Bourhis of Press' proposals. "My second is, he's hypocritical as hell, to be 
taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from automobile accident mills to fund 
10-second TV spots one day, and to say he's going after fraud the next." 
</P>
<P>
Press, however, said those who question his independence don't know him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm unbought and unbossed," he said. "I'm the Democrat who took on Jerry Brown 
and Tom Bradley. As a Catholic, I took on the Pope for opposing birth control. 
I opposed KABC (the station he worked for as a television commentator) for 
hiring Morton Downey." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tom Skornia, a Republican candidate, also said he had been 
suggesting anti-fraud ideas similar to Press' "for some months now." 
</P>
<P>
Two other candidates were noncommittal or dubious about the anti-fraud 
approaches of Press, Garamendi, Bourhis and Skornia. Democrat Walter Zelman 
said he wanted to study them and Democrat Conway Collis suggested: "The better 
way to go after it is to roll back rates under Proposition 103. When you force 
the companies to reduce rates, they'll go after fraud on their own."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
SMITH, LUNGREN SQUARE OFF ON ABORTION, OIL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a possible presage to the fall campaign for state attorney general, 
Republican Dan Lungren and Democrat Arlo Smith sparred on the issues of 
abortion rights and offshore oil drilling at their first head-to-head 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who will face Smith in next month's 
Democratic primary, did not attend the unusual Santa Monica Bar Assn. Law Day 
forum Tuesday night, citing a scheduling conflict. 
</P>
<P>
While Reiner and Smith both agreed on such fundamental issues as reproductive 
rights and oil drilling, it took Smith little time to spotlight substantial 
differences with Lungren -- the man either Reiner or Smith will meet in the 
November general election. 
</P>
<P>
Devoting his entire 15-minute opening statement to the question of abortion, 
Smith vowed to "personally argue any case whether it be in the Municipal Court 
or the U.S. Supreme Court" to protect abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is first of all, one of very deep belief. I am a father. And I 
will not stand to allow the rights of my daughter to become a political 
football kicked around by politicians scrambling for the votes," said Smith, 
the San Francisco district attorney who has been endorsed by the state chapter 
of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
Smith added that privacy provisions in the state Constitution clearly protect a 
woman's right of choice. "I will fight any legislation that threatens that 
right," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, a longtime foe of abortion, accused abortion rights activists of 
seeking to make the issue "a litmus test (for holding) public office," much as 
they "criticized the pro-life people for raising it a couple years ago." 
</P>
<P>
As attorney general, Lungren said after the forum, he would go to court to 
defend possible state legislation cutting off Medi-Cal funding for abortions. 
Smith and Reiner have said that they would refuse to defend such legislation on 
constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, who is running unopposed for the Republican nomination, did agree with 
Smith on one abortion-related issue. He said that the wording of Proposition 
115, the sweeping anti-crime initiative on the June ballot, would not 
jeopardize abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the forum, held at the Riviera Country Club, Smith drew applause from 
the 75-member audience when he emphasized his opposition to offshore oil 
drilling. "I will be there to fight anyone who wants to start drilling off of 
the Pacific Palisades or off the coast of San Francisco or any other place in 
this state," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, on the other hand, received lighter applause when he countered that 
offshore drilling must be considered "on a case-by-case basis, an area-by-area 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have very stringent environmental standards, very stringent 
environmental controls," said Lungren. " . . . (But) as long as there are 
energy needs in this country, we have to provide a careful balancing act. . . . 
If we're going to say we are going to absolutely restrict energy supplies to 
California, we ought to have the guts to then come up and say what our 
alternative methods of transportation are going to be and how much they are 
going to cost the people." 
</P>
<P>
The subject of oil drilling is particularly sensitive in Pacific Palisades, 
where Occidental Petroleum Corp. lost a bitter 1988 referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The debate also focused on street crime and drug abuse, with each candidate 
maintaining that he is better qualified to handle the problems. Smith cited his 
36 years experience as a district attorney and a deputy attorney general, while 
Lungren focused on his decade in Congress, where he sponsored or helped win 
passage of several major anti-crime bills. 
</P>
<P>
Inter-party debates are highly out of the ordinary before a primary, but both 
candidates said they would look forward to additional encounters and criticized 
Reiner for not joining them. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, long seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has 
participated in three forums with Smith, including one at the recent state 
Democratic convention in Los Angeles. But Reiner so far has declined Smith's 
proposal for a series of four pre-primary debates in major cities across the 
state on specific topics ranging from street gang violence to corruption in 
government.

A central suspect in the sensational slaying two years ago of Hector Felix 
Miranda, a prominent Tijuana journalist widely known as El Gato, or The Cat, 
was in the custody of Mexican authorities Wednesday after his arrest by Los 
Angeles authorities earlier this week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Vera Palestina, former chief of security at Tijuana's Caliente 
Racetrack, was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon as he arrived near the 
Greyhound bus terminal in downtown Los Angeles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police and U.S. immigration officers arrested the longtime fugitive 
after receiving a tip from Baja California authorities, who have been 
investigating the journalist's slaying in April, 1988. Vera went to the station 
to meet a friend, according to a statement by the Los Angeles Police 
Department, which set up surveillance at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Vera, 38, a former police officer in Mexico City, was in the United States 
illegally and was consequently turned over to U.S. immigration authorities. On 
Tuesday evening, he was returned to the U.S.-Mexico border, where he was turned 
over to state police agents and jailed in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, 47, was killed on April 20, 1988, as he drove to work down a 
rain-slicked street in Tijuana. A vehicle blocked his path, and an assassin 
pumped two rounds from a 12-gauge shotgun through the driver's window of his 
car.

POLICE COPTER ROLLS OVER; OFFICERS UNHURT

Two Los Angeles police officers escaped injury Wednesday when their helicopter 
rolled over during takeoff from a La Verne airfield, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bell 206 JetRanger, one of the older helicopters in the department's fleet, 
was taking off from Brackett Field when the accident occurred, Sgt. Brent Carey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Bob Kercy and Bud Nowell, who were on board the aircraft, were not 
hurt, but "there was extensive damage to the airframe," Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
No financial estimate of the damage was available. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials have been trying to update the helicopter fleet, saying 
that many of the crafts are too old for use. The helicopter involved in 
Wednesday's accident will be rebuilt, Carey added.

NHL PLAYOFFS: STEVE SMITH SCORES TWO GOALS AS EDMONTON TAKES 1-0 LEAD IN 
CAMPBELL CONFERENCE FINAL, 5-2.

Steve Smith scored two goals in a playoff game for the first time in his career 
as the Edmonton Oilers rolled to their eighth consecutive victory by beating 
the Chicago Blackhawks, 5-2, Wednesday night in the opener of the Campbell 
Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who had only seven goals during the regular season and only five career 
playoff goals, scored what proved to be the winning goal at 8:52 of the second 
period on a screened slap shot from the left point. He added the Oilers' fourth 
goal early in the third period when his wrist shot from the right circle hit 
the post and goaltender Ed Belfour's back before trickling into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were sharp despite an eight-day layoff. Chicago was coming off 
Monday night's 8-2 victory over St. Louis in Game 7 of that series. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we'd have to be on top of our game," Smith said. "Even though we knew 
they'd be a little tired, they could get into a groove." 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday night, Smith's most notable goal was one he accidentally put 
into his own net in the third period of Game 7 of the 1986 Smythe Division 
final against Calgary, ending the Oilers' two-year reign as Stanley Cup 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers haven't lost since dropping the fourth game of the Smythe Division 
semifinals against Winnipeg on April 10. Game 2 is Friday night at the 
Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers dominated the first period, outshooting Chicago, 12-3, and scoring 
the only goal when Mark Messier took Charlie Huddy's pass at center ice, went 
in alone and beat Belfour at 9:32. It was his sixth goal of the playoffs and 
10th in 10 career playoff games against the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no excuse for the way we played," Chicago Coach Mike Keenan said. "I'm 
extremely disappointed. You don't have to play great in the playoffs as long as 
you win. The Oilers have a 1-0 advantage on a team and they didn't have to work 
very hard to get it. There were no bright spots."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rarely has a team dominated a series it trails as the Houston Rockets are 
dominating their series with the Lakers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, who are trailing, two games to one, have led or been tied for 113 
of the 144 minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for those who thought Houston would mail in Game 3 Tuesday night after 
folding down the stretch at the Forum Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon's jamming up the middle, discouraging the Lakers from driving 
the lane and forcing Magic Johnson to alter his game, is reminiscent of Utah's 
Mark Eaton against Los Angeles two years ago in the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's mind-boggling that a team with the talent that Houston has was no better 
than 41-41 during the regular season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Attention Pat Riley: Whatever happened to Larry Drew? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, Chris McCarron, Patrick Valenzuela, Alex Solis, Kent Desormeaux 
and Laffit Pincay will be trying to make it eight Kentucky Derby victories in 
the last nine years for jockeys who work the Southern California circuit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, aboard Mister Frisky, figures to have the best chance. And right now, 
he is the best of the riders. Coming off a championship meeting at Santa Anita, 
Stevens, 27, is without a weakness. He's equally adept in sprint, distance, 
turf or dirt races, on front-runners or come-from- 
</P>
<P>
behinders. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you like Summer Squall, you will probably get higher odds on him at 
Hollywood Park than in Las Vegas or Louisville. The price on the local 
favorite, Mister Frisky, should be shorter here. Last May, Sunday Silence paid 
$8.20 at Churchill Downs -- and in Nevada, which uses track odds -- and only $6 
at Hollywood Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Biggest longshot ever to win the Derby was Donerail, who paid $184.90 in 1913. 
Count Fleet in 1943 and Citation in 1948 each paid $2.80. Secretariat paid $5 
in 1973. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It costs $20,000 to get a colt or a filly to the post -- an entry fee of 
$10,000 and a starting fee of $10,000, and only the first four finishers 
receive purse money. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall may be a mud freak who isn't capable of going 1 1/4 miles on a 
fast track. . . . Only 21 of the 115 runnings of the Derby have been won 
wire-to-wire, the last time by the filly, Winning Colors, in 1988. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that ABC has Al Michaels and Brent Musburger, all it needs is some events. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
The network is doing the Derby, but the problem with the telecast is that it 
lasts 90 minutes and the race lasts about two minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of my favorite events," Michaels says. "Not only is the race 
unpredictable, so is everything leading up to it. Look back six months and see 
which horses figured to be the contenders. Most of them aren't even entered.". 
. . 
</P>
<P>
More Michaels on the Derby: "Unlike the Super Bowl and the World Series, it's 
still available to the masses. You don't have to know somebody, be a corporate 
executive or have a lot of money to attend. Everybody can get in.". . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a longshot, try Land Rush. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham's Warcraft didn't make it to Louisville but will be busy on 
Derby Day, anyway, running in the $100,000 Spotlight Breeders' Cup Handicap on 
the turf at Hollywood Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'd be a lot more interested in the rest of the Stanley Cup playoffs if I could 
get the SportsChannel telecasts on my set. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Anybody else remember "Wrestling Workouts" from the Hollywood Legion Stadium? . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
When he stops preaching and boxing, George Foreman can make a living as a 
standup comedian. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Those Detroit Piston defenders are it again, not allowing Indiana to score 100 
points in any of the three games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Here's how Chick Hearn put Game 3 in the refrigerator for Houston: "Darn, I 
didn't want Marge to have to mow the lawn tomorrow.". . . 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull, who was the leading scorer in the NHL this season but only the St. 
Louis Blues' 15th-highest-paid player at $125,000, deserves a raise. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA concludes spring practice with its annual football appreciation day 
Saturday at 10:30 a.m. at Spaulding Field. The public is invited free for a 
brief workout, introductions of the players and coaching staff and a photo and 
autograph session. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's new relief ace is 36-year-old John Candelaria. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is it too late to retract my prediction of a World Series between the Kansas 
City Royals and the New York Mets? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The highest Mariano Duncan, who has been leading the National League in 
hitting, ever batted for the Dodgers was .250 in 49 games before the trade that 
sent him and Tim Leary to Cincinnati for Kal Daniels last July. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How nice it is to see the major league office get tough and start cracking down 
on fielders who use gloves that measure more than 12 inches from heel to finger 
tip. What awful cheaters and menaces to society!

Mats Wilander said Wednesday he will miss the French Open, which he has won 
three times, and probably won't play at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, the former No. 1 player who has dropped out of the top 10, said he 
hasn't played tennis since March and won't be in condition in time to compete 
in Paris later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I need at least two or three weeks hard training to compete," Wilander said. 
"After that, 15 to 20 matches are needed to reach peak form." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, denying he is quitting the game, said he intended to stay on the 
circuit another two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not bored with being at home yet," he said. "Once I am, motivation will 
return and then I will start playing again."

Patrick Ewing kept the New York Knicks in the playoffs Wednesday night with 33 
points and 19 rebounds in a 102-99 victory over the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has given us a lot of flak for the way we've played in this series, 
said we were quitting," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not quitters, and I think we showed that." 
</P>
<P>
Boston, which scored an NBA record 157 points on 67% shooting in Game 2, saw a 
much more intense defensive effort by the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics managed to outshoot New York 51.4% to 39.6%, but the Knicks took 27 
more shots. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Oakley had 13 rebounds. His six offensive rebounds helped lead New York 
to a 21-5 advantage in that department. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth game will be Friday night at Madison Square Garden, and if the 
Knicks win, the fifth and deciding game would be Sunday at Boston Garden, where 
the Celtics have beaten the Knicks 26 consecutive times since Feb. 29, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing had 21 points and 16 rebounds at halftime, but he committed his fourth 
foul early in the third quarter and left with the score tied, 60-60. 
</P>
<P>
But the Knicks outscored Boston, 21-19, and took an 81-79 lead into the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing returned and scored the first five points of the fourth quarter, giving 
New York a seven-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks expanded the margin to 91-83 with six minutes left, but the Celtics 
closed to 100-99 on a free throw by Reggie Lewis with 29 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Walker hit a jump shot from 15 feet for a three-point lead with 7.6 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
On the Celtics' final possession, Larry Bird missed an uncontested three-point 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Bird finished with 31 points, Dennis Johnson 18 and Kevin McHale 17 for the 
Celtics. Gerald Wilkins had 15 points for New York.

HE KNOWS HOW TO BEAT TRAFFIC AT STADIUM

<P>
Until the manufacturers built the Grand National sport truck class into stadium 
off-road racing's most-talked-about event a few years ago, the No. 1 attraction 
was the single-seat buggies. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Arciero Jr. -- Butch to friends and associates -- is the all-time 
winningest driver in the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Gran Prix, and most of his 
success has come in the desert buggies. Arciero, 43, of Laguna Hills, has won 
14 stadium races -- three in unlimited single-seaters, which no longer are 
running in the stadiums, 10 in Super 1600s and one in a Grand National truck. 
</P>
<P>
When Arciero won the Super 1600 main event in the Thompson season-opener 
January in Anaheim Stadium, he broke out of a tie with Glenn Harris of 
Camarillo, whose 13 victories also included a variety of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night in the Rose Bowl, in the sixth round of the Mickey Thompson 
series, Arciero and Harris both will be driving -- Arciero in his Super 1600 
and Harris in a Jeep Comanche as a teammate of Walker Evans. 
</P>
<P>
A Super 1600 is the same open-wheeled desert racing machine as an unlimited, 
except that its power is limited to rear-mounted 1600cc engines, usually 
Volkswagens or Toyotas. 
</P>
<P>
"Competition is getting tougher every year," Arciero said in discussing the 
Super 1600 Rose Bowl race. "Bobby Gordon and Mitch Mustard are tough in every 
race. Bobby is my desert racing partner and has been driving stadium races 
nearly as long as I have." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon won in Seattle and Mustard, the defending champion from Arvada, Colo., 
won at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg George, in the new Sage Council team, is coming on strong, too," Arciero 
said. "He led half the race at Anaheim before I passed him, and then he won in 
San Diego. He was a big winner in ultrastocks and now he's doing real well in 
the 1600s." 
</P>
<P>
George, from Colton, Calif., won seven ultrastock races, including the Rose 
Bowl in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Arciero's father, Frank, has fielded Indy cars and sports cars for five 
decades. His drivers have included Dan Gurney, Jimmy Clark, Bobby and Al Unser, 
Parnelli Jones and Michael Andretti. However, when Frank Jr. was young, his 
interest was baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I played third base at Cantwell High and Long Beach State and summers for a 
Red Sox semipro farm team in Montebello," Arciero said. "My brother, Arthur, 
was the one who loved cars. He was always in the shop, working with the 
mechanics, but I spent my time on the ball field." 
</P>
<P>
When Butch decided his future lay more with the family construction business 
than with professional baseball, he was working as a laborer one day in San 
Fernando when the job foreman learned he was an Arciero and wanted to talk 
off-road racing. 
</P>
<P>
"We became friends and before you knew it, he had Arthur and me over to his 
house to sell us a racing buggy," Butch said. "Arthur prepared it and we raced 
for the first time in the (1971) Mint 400. My big thrill was being bumped by 
Parnelli Jones. He ended up winning and I ended up stuck out in the middle of 
the mountains with no radio communication. I just sat there until about 2 in 
the morning when I heard my dad's voice. He'd come looking and stumbled onto 
our car." 
</P>
<P>
Butch and Arthur became regulars on the desert racing scene. When Thompson 
started his stadium racing series in 1979, the Arcieros built their own 
practice track in Diamond Bar, where they could simulate racing in stadiums. 
The course was recently closed because of encroaching housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I got hooked on racing, I was nearly 30. So there was no chance 
for me to move on to Indy cars or anything like that, but I still enjoy racing. 
I'll do two or three desert races with Bobby Gordon and the stadium series. 
We're still going to beat Ivan (Stewart) before the year is out." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, driving solo in a Toyota truck, has won the last two Mint 400s. Each 
time the Arciero-Gordon car was second. 
</P>

"We had him beat this year -- we had eight or nine minutes on him -- when we 
had an electrical problem. Before we could fix it, Ivan was by us. It was 
really frustrating, but there's still the Firecracker 250 and the Baja 1000 to 
get him." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hornaday Sr. won the Winston West stock car championship twice, in 1963 and 
1964, and now Ron Jr. is going after the NASCAR Southwest Tour title. 
</P>
<P>
After two of the 18 races, Hornaday holds a 28-point lead and the next race is 
on his home track, Saugus Speedway, on Saturday night. Hornaday, a 31-year-old 
mechanic from Palmdale, won the 1987 modified championship at Saugus and races 
there regularly when there is no Southwest Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
"I love running Saugus," he said. "There's no other track I'd rather go to. 
It's so flat and hard to drive that if you master it, you'll be able to master 
any other short track around here. That's why the Saugus guys do so well in the 
Tour." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Press, a two-time Saugus modified champion, is defending Southwest Tour 
champion. Two other former Saugus drivers, Dennis Dyer and Ray Hooper Jr., are 
second and third behind Hornaday in this year's standings. 
</P>
<P>
Press won both Southwest Tour races last year on the one-third mile Saugus 
saucer. If he can win Saturday night's Miller Genuine Draft 100, he will become 
first Tour driver to win three consecutive races on the same track. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt Dan is the one to beat because he's got his act together and 
he runs real strong, but that doesn't mean we can't do it," Hornaday said. "Dan 
intimidates a lot of people by coming up behind them and tapping their bumper. 
He hopes it gets you out of the groove enough for him to get hard on the gas 
and slip underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys do that, but Dan's absolutely the best at it. I've run with him 
enough that it doesn't bother me. In fact, I'm getting to have the same sort of 
reputation that he does, but you have to have an edge, especially at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why the stands are always packed there. The fans know they're going to 
get an exciting bump-and-run show." 
</P>
<P>

SINGING PRAISES OF THE NEW MAN BEHIND THE MASK; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: ROBERT GUILLAUME RECEIVES ADULATION AND A STANDING OVATION ON HIS FIRST 
NIGHT AS THE PHANTOM.

<P>
"The Phantom of the Opera," May 1, 1990. Act I, Scene I. Fade out Crawford. 
Fade in Guillaume. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Robert Guillaume on Tuesday stepped into the mask of the Phantom in 
Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit musical at the Ahmanson Theatre, only two days after 
original Phantom Michael Crawford took his final bows and left the same stage 
to thunderous ovations and cries of "Please Don't Go!" 
</P>
<P>
When Guillaume was first announced as Crawford's replacement in the Los Angeles 
production, numerous Phantom freaks didn't give him an opera ghost of a chance. 
How could a sitcom actor best known for playing a wisecracking 
butler-turned-lieutenant governor possibly possess the sensuality, strong voice 
and charisma of Crawford's Phantom? they asked. 
</P>
<P>
But many in attendance on Guillaume's opening night were singing a different 
tune by the end of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus? Guillaume wasn't Crawford. But he wasn't a letdown either. 
</P>
<P>
As the talkative crowd filed out of the Ahmanson, some were saying Guillaume 
was just as effective as his predecessor. Others said he was even better. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved him, I loved him, I loved him!" said Beverly Kelly, 37, as she left 
the theater with a bag stuffed with Phantom souvenirs. "I thought it was great. 
I'm so glad I saw him instead of Crawford." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a special education teacher, said she had received the tickets in 
February as a birthday present, and was disappointed when she heard Crawford 
would be leaving before she got a chance to see him. "Now I feel the money 
didn't go to waste," she said. 
</P>
<P>
John Toay, 59, a pastor at a Presbyterian church in Downey, said "Guillaume was 
fabulous. I saw the play before with Crawford, and of course he was great. But 
I really liked Robert Guillaume in the part. I would see the play again with 
him in it." 
</P>
<P>
The only complaint heard around the Ahmanson was that Guillaume exhibited a 
little nervousness and seemed a bit stilted in his body language during his 
first appearences. But several audience members chalked it up to first-night 
jitters. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity audience awarded the actor with a standing ovation, supplemented 
by whoops and cheers. While the response didn't quite approach the adulation 
that Sunday's audience bestowed upon Crawford, it still appeared to be a 
triumph for the 62-year-old Guillaume, who greeted the applause with a smile 
during his curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
Guillaume won the role over hundreds of hopefuls. Although most know him as 
TV's "Benson," he is classically trained in theater and voice, and has appeared 
in stage productions of "Purlie," "Guys and Dolls" and "Porgy and Bess." 
</P>
<P>
Still, several theatrical observers felt Crawford's mask was too big to fill. 
The British actor had won several awards, including a Tony, for his portrayal 
of the love-stuck murderer. Fans returned to see him as many as 100 times. 
Large crowds gathered outside the stage door to wait for autographs or a 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
His departure was regarded as a milestone in L.A. theater. Scalpers' prices for 
the final week of Crawford's performances reached thousands of dollars. The 
frenzy by non-ticket holders to get a final glimpse of Crawford's Phantom 
continued outside the Ahmanson even after the musical began on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, no trace of Crawford was to be found. His picture had been 
removed from display cases and from the complimentary program. However, 
Guillaume's picture only appeared once in the program above the cast 
biographies, and no pictures of him as the Phantom were to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Before the lights went down, some in the audience said they felt nervous for 
Guillaume. "I feel like we should all give him a cheer," said one woman sitting 
in the Parquet Terrace to her companion. "I think everyone here is rooting for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
As the theater darkened, she chanted, "Go, Robert!" 
</P>
<P>
The audience was silent at Guillaume's first appearence as the Phantom, 
materializing behind a mirror. The mask that covered his disfigured face was a 
metallic gray, while Crawford's had been ivory. 
</P>
<P>
During the Phantom's main ballad, "Music of the Night," Guillaume exhibited a 
deep, expressive voice, but not the sensual body language that had been 
Crawford's trademark. He did not rub his hands over his body, and did not make 
much contact with Christine (Dale Kristien), the object of the Phantom's 
affection. 
</P>
<P>
Still, by intermission, Guillaume seemed to have won many audience members 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made the part his own," said Gregory Gershuni, 35, an attorney who has 
seen "Phantom" six times. "He's sensual, but in a different sort of way. He has 
the same intensity as Crawford. Crawford was slick and polished. But this is 
Guillaume's opening night, and I'm in awe of him." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Landa, 48, who sat next to Gershuni, said he had never seen "Phantom" 
before, "so I have nothing to compare to. But I can't imagine anyone else in 
the role. I can really feel the pathos and the emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fanfare of Guillaume's maiden voyage, his curtain call was 
relatively low key. He was not presented with flowers, as Crawford was at his 
final performance, and most of his bows were taken while holding hands with 
other cast members. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford will soon be making the film version of "Phantom." But the new man in 
the mask will be at the Ahmanson for at least the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll definitely be back," Gershuni said.

TV MOVIE 'HEAT WAVE' TRACES THE WATTS RIOTS THAT LEFT A CITY UNDER SIEGE 25 
YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Bob Richardson is hanging around locations for "Heat Wave," a TV movie about 
those sweaty August nights nearly 25 years ago when the ghettos in 
South-Central L.A. exploded into a holocaust. It was called the Watts riots, 
although some people prefer "insurrection." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, raised in the neighborhood, watched in horror as much of it was 
burned and pillaged. Then 24, he was working as a classified ad messenger for 
The Times. The paper had no black reporters and the white ones were being 
brutalized by angry mobs that first night of Aug. 11, so he volunteered to go 
"in." In one of several Page 1 stories under his byline (which identified him 
as an ad salesman), "It's a wonder anyone with white skin got out of there 
alive." His story is central to the TV film. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, scheduled for airing on the TNT cable channel during the August 
anniversary, is midway in a tricky 25-day shooting schedule on locations in 
several still-very-much-anguished Los Angeles neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
It's different, this time around. The neighbors were applauding Monday when the 
white California motor cop busted one of the brothers -- re-creating the 
incident that unleashed the rage. But these neighbors were the extras, and the 
Pueblo projects at Holmes Avenue and 54th Street were representing Avalon 
Boulevard and 116th Street, where it all happened. The crowd was cheering 
because it was a good take, show business being show business. 
</P>
<P>
The real riots left Richardson with residual nightmares, as they had other 
people, but the other day he was recounting some ludicrous scenes. He had been 
watching mobs pillage a store when "one guy comes up with this truck and he 
loads these refrigerators and washers on the truck," he remembered, "and he's 
back in 10 minutes and he parks the truck and he comes back with more washers 
and refrigerators -- and his truck is gone!" 
</P>
<P>
Richardson stomped his feet and raged around the room imagining the furious 
looter: "Some (expletive) stole my truck!" 
</P>
<P>
Richardson went on with his story: "Then it became not funny. The National 
Guard came, kids brandishing 30-caliber machine guns. They were from places 
like Redwood City or Eureka or Glendale. The only black person they ever saw 
was on the Aunt Jemima box. They were killing anything that moved -- dogs, 
cats. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The deadly reality: 35 killed (30 of them black; some claim this figure is 
ridiculously low), 1,200 injured, 4,000 arrested in six days and nights of 
beating, looting, rock-throwing, arson, rifle sniping and fire-bombing over a 
150-block, 54-square-mile area. Police were augmented by 13,900 National 
Guardsmen arriving by truckloads. 
</P>
<P>
These many years later, Michael Lazarou, a young Hollywood writer with a 
fascination for history, knew that the way to dramatize anarchy of this 
dimension was to focus on it in human terms. He learned about Richardson and 
realized he could be the pivotal "story." 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Jordan Kerner and director Kevin Hooks have put together 
major casting for "Heat Wave," including Blair Underwood ("L.A. Law"), who 
plays Richardson, and four Oscar-nominated actors: Cicely Tyson (nominated for 
"Sounder," in which she played Hooks' mother) is Motherdear, his righteous 
grandmother; James Earl Jones ("The Great White Hope") is Junius, who runs a 
shoeshine parlor in Watts; Margaret Avery ("The Color Purple") is the mother of 
Richardson's buddy, and Sally Kirkland ("Anna") is a white Beverly Hills matron 
for whom Motherdear works as a housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarou, 4 at the time of the riots, was an unlikely candidate to chronicle 
these events. He is white and his career has been writing comedy, including 
"Doogie Howser, M.D." and a screenplay for Universal Studios and Amblin 
Entertainment based on the novel "A Super Bowl for the Kremlin" (Russkies take 
over the Minnesota Vikings). He also has a two-script contract with for 
Hollywood Pictures, the new Disney division. 
</P>
<P>
He was researching L.A. history for a script when he heard about Richardson. 
The idea of the riot story began to consume him, even more so when he couldn't 
find Richardson. Finally, he did. 
</P>
<P>
"My hand was literally shaking and my heart was pounding," Lazarou recalled. 
"Two years of obsessing and I have his phone number staring me in the face. The 
first thing I blurted out of my mouth was, 'Where have you been!?' " 
</P>
<P>
Lazarou, who sparkles with passion for his movie, said that he conducted 
extensive research, including interviews with police and rioters, sometimes 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people who never so much had a traffic ticket who became openly 
violent," he said. "The levels of anger and hostility and feelings of betrayal 
were so deep and so painful that it was just . . . uncontrollable." 
</P>
<P>
The result of the riots, Lazarou said, is "that we have 120 sets of Crips, 95 
sets of Bloods and the whole crack epidemic being franchised by L.A. gang 
members to small towns all over America. . . . That is directly attributable to 
the fact that the lessons were not learned. Nothing was done, really. 
Ultimately, the status quo was maintained and the situation was allowed to 
deteriorate further." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson had talked with friends about a riot movie before "but people wanted 
a happy ending," he recalled. Producer Kerner said the movie has happy resolves 
in that Richardson gets hired by The Times as its first black reporter-trainee 
and the paper wins the Pulitzer Prize for its riot coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's life didn't go so well. His $99-a-week reporting job (versus the 
$145 he'd been making as a messenger in Classified) had him working nights on 
the "disaster desk," which involved, as he describes it, hanging with some 
other staffers at a popular bar near The Times waiting for a fire or some 
catastrophe. He'd go to the scene and call in details. 
</P>
<P>
"I was incapable of doing anything in depth," he said. "I really wasn't trained 
for that. I was scared to death every night." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, with an exuberant, wry personality, is most candid about his 
alcoholism. He related that within a year he was fired from The Times for 
drinking, among many such dismissals he has endured over the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I wound up down on Skid Row. And I was down there for maybe a year. I became a 
connoisseur of good cardboard (his mattress)." 
</P>
<P>
His resume is the stuff of the incredible: the Army (a sharpshooter), Kelly 
Girl temp typist, ditch digger, welfare work, truck driving, insurance, private 
investigation (including bounty hunting), dish washer in Phoenix, disc jockey 
in Houston, selling tamales out of a pushcart in New Orleans, three months at 
the California Institution for Men at Chino for check forgery, plus various 
assignments on local radio and TV. 
</P>
<P>
"This movie is re-creating my life," he said. "Nine months ago, when we first 
started this -- well, once again I was sitting on a curb, sleeping on cardboard 
in shelters and once again the Salvation Army was there and put me to work in a 
chapel, gaining my self respect back, starting playing piano in the chapel and 
working as a tutor, reading, writing and math skills. And getting spiritual 
guidance." 
</P>
<P>
How long since he's had a drink? "You know, I don't like to discuss time. I do 
this one day at a time. I didn't drink yesterday, I'm not drinking today." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't know what he'll do next. "It'll be revealed to me." 
</P>

Look out for "Look Who's Talking," the romantic comedy starring John Travolta 
and Kirstie Alley. After just two weeks, it's already No. 2 on the Billboard 
magazine rental chart. 
</P>
<P>
Next week it should bump "Dead Poets Society" out of the top spot. "Shirley 
Valentine," boasting the performance that earned Pauline Collins an Oscar 
nomination, is doing respectable rental business, moving up four notches to No. 
23. "Black Rain," the violent cop movie starring Michael Douglas, debuted at 
No. 12. "Communion," with Christopher Walken, is also doing fairly well, 
climbing from No. 26 to No. 20. 
</P>
<P>
* "Sea of Love," the steamy thriller featuring Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin, 
looms as the most popular rental-market thriller for the first half of the year 
and should easily crack the Top Three. A box-office winner, it grossed $57 
million.

WARNING TO DEADHEADS: GROUP NOT GRATEFUL FOR ROWDY FANS; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: 'MEATHEADS' COULD BRING AN END TO GRATEFUL DEAD'S CONCERTIZING, 
THEIR PROMOTER THREATENS.

<P>
Could the Grateful Dead's shows Saturday and Sunday at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills' soccer field be the veteran group's last in the Los Angeles area? 
</P>
<P>
Bill Graham, the dean of rock concert promoters who has worked with the Dead 
since 1966, isn't exactly shouting "the end is near." But he warns Deadheads 
that, thanks to poor behavior by a small minority of fans, the group's concert 
future -- in Southern California and elsewhere -- is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe because you parked on the highway and defecated on a lawn, maybe next 
time we'll be 300 miles away," he scolded during a recent L.A. visit to film a 
small part as a concert promoter in "The Doors," Oliver Stone's Jim Morrison 
movie. "Maybe next time we're not coming to your town." 
</P>
<P>
The Dead is already unwelcome at Orange County's Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
When the group played three dates there in April, 1989, 91 arrests resulted as 
fans clashed with security forces, parked illegally and otherwise raised 
community hackles. The Dead is still on good terms with the Forum, despite the 
death of a fan in police custody during a three-day stand in December. A 
planned return engagement in February was postponed so that security measures 
could be re-evaluated, and this weekend's outdoor shows were scheduled instead. 
The Dead expects to return to the Forum within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion of its legion of Deadheads -- many of whom follow the band from 
concert to concert around the country, establishing temporary villages near 
show sites -- has caused the Dead organization to declare that it has outgrown 
a number of traditionally favored concert sites, including in its own back yard 
at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Graham wants the band's loyal fans to think about that while they enjoy the 
post-hippie vibes this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you should ask yourselves, 'Why did we lose Irvine?' " Graham said, 
identifying the biggest problem as people who show up without tickets and then 
become agitated when unable to acquire them at the site. 
</P>
<P>
While the vast majority of Deadheads are peaceful, many of these Meatheads, as 
Graham calls them, are rowdier newcomers, brought on board by the band's Top 10 
1987 album "In the Dark." This has also focused attention on drug use by some 
Dead followers and the inconsiderateness of some who camp near the concerts. 
That behavior this weekend, he said, would likely mean the loss of another 
concert site. 
</P>
<P>
"If people come and loiter and leave garbage or urinate in public or challenge 
the law, then goodby to the facility," said Graham, 59, who began his career as 
a concert promoter with a Grateful Dead show in 1966 and has helped develop the 
band into one of the most successful touring acts in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"What if I came to your house and acted like that?" he continued. "I'm all for 
the (Deadhead) spirit, but not when it's abused. There's all this to-do about 
getting busted and the 'horrible police.' I'm not taking the side of the 
police, but until they change the laws, why are (people) surprised that what 
they want to do they're not allowed (to)?" 
</P>
<P>
The first solution, Graham said, is simple: "If you don't have a ticket, don't 
come. Don't be a child about it." 
</P>
<P>
Graham may be one of the field's most successful and respected businessmen, but 
when he talks about the Grateful Dead he sounds like a mystical high priest of 
Deadheads. 
</P>
<P>
"They've meant so much to so many people and have a pure spirit that came out 
of the '60s, and the Dead crowd on a righteous night exhibits that spirit," 
said the colorful promoter, who's currently in discussions about marking the 
group's silver anniversary with the June concerts at Mammoth Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at me and say, 'You're a businessman and a New Yorker and you're a 
Deadhead?' What can I say? I love the music and the space and it personifies 
that spirit." 
</P>
<P>
As a Deadhead, Graham is calling on others to take the responsibility for the 
actions of the newer members of the "family." 
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for the Deadheads and fans, and one thing I've noted is 
rarely does someone get out of line, and when they do others generally deal 
with it," he said. "It's up to the veterans to explain to the new ones: 'You 
know it's wrong, so why are you doing it?' "

Wrong Term -- In a Thursday Calendar story about problems associated with 
Grateful Dead concerts, rock promoter Bill Graham was incorrectly quoted as 
calling trouble-making fans "Meatheads." The term he used was "Me-heads," 
refering to a small but rowdy minority of newer Dead fans who show up at 
concerts without tickets and become agitated when unable to acquire them at the 
site.

CLEAN CAMPAIGN: UCI student elections officials expect all the campaign posters 
to be gone by Saturday afternoon, 48 hours after the end of voting. . . . Why? 
Because a candidate who doesn't comply could be disqualified, even after he's 
won. 
</P>
<P>
And no one will know the winners until Monday. . . . But is it legal? No, says 
attorney Dan Stormer, who successfully sued the university in 1985 to reform 
student election regulations. "It's ludicrous. It's election by intimidation," 
he says. Steve Emmons and Cristina Lee

MAJOR LOSS OF HEALTH FUNDING FOR O.C. FEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A staggering $19.1 million in state funding for health care programs would be 
stripped from Orange County under Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed budget for 
the coming year, according to a report sent Wednesday to the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The county would be forced to rely on "transitory and less predictable" sources 
of revenue in place of state funding now received for indigent medical care, 
general public health and a host of other services including care for 
emotionally disturbed children, according to the report from County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
Future tax revenue could well offset the cuts, Schneider said, but those funds 
cannot be relied upon. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget proposes that a major reduction of 31.9% in the local government 
relief fund and a continued cut in medically indigent services be offset by 
(revenue sources) the county does not have a sufficient track record with," 
Schneider wrote to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The report says Deukmejian's budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning July 
1 would eliminate $8.5 million in current state funding for Orange County's 
general public health programs and $8.35 million in funding for health care for 
the poor. The budget also eliminates $1.5 million in inflation adjustments that 
had been projected for the county's health programs next year, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposal suggests that the county would make up the money 
through funding that will become available from the Proposition 99 tobacco tax 
and proposed increases in state reimbursements for services the county 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
Because those reimbursements depend on the number of Medi-Cal and other 
assistance claims filed by county residents in any given year, county officials 
cannot predict with any certainty how much money will be available, Schneider's 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Further clouding the county's economic forecast, the report continues, is the 
uncertainty of Proposition 111 on the June ballot. The gas tax initiative, if 
approved, is also expected to offset some of the shortfalls, according to the 
governor's proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that it only adds insult to injury," Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder 
said in angry reaction to the budget news, which is scheduled to be formally 
presented to the board Tuesday. "Orange County doesn't get fair equity from the 
state now. . . . It sounds like a challenge to the voters that if you want 
everything from health care to roads, you better vote for 111." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's own proposed budget for next year is already threatened by a 
deficit of as much as $25 million; officials project expenditures of $436 
million against revenue of only $410.7 million. A similar deficit projected 
last year, however, was erased by departmental belt-tightening and 
unanticipated revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider's analysis of the governor's $53.1-billon budget -- containing a 
$1-billion statewide reduction in aid to poor families, counties, the elderly 
and disabled -- was not sent to the board offices until late Wednesday, and 
some supervisors have not yet seen it. Dan Wooldridge, an aide to Supervisor 
Don R. Roth, said, however, that county budget experts had already warned 
officials that the county would face substantial cuts in state funding under 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge described county officials as deeply concerned but hopeful that some 
of the funding would be restored by the Legislature or replaced by other 
sources in time to avert massive county cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking this seriously," Wooldridge said, "but while the governor can 
propose cuts, the Legislature can put some things back." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider's analysis concludes that the governor's budget will eliminate 
funding for several programs of "particular importance" to county health 
officials. Among the services for which the state will no longer provide money 
are transportation and psychological services for mentally ill patients, as 
well as heroin detoxification programs. The report does not say how much it 
would cost the county to pick up the tab for those programs. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's budget also eliminates $802,000 for severely emotionally 
disturbed children that currently goes to the county health department. 
Services for these children might be provided through the state Department of 
Education, although that remains unclear, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
County officials predicted that the governor's proposed cuts would face 
significant opposition from local governments throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"There will no doubt be reaction throughout the counties and the Legislature," 
Schneider predicted in his report, "in which Orange County will want to 
participate." 
</P>

LEAK BUSTERS: Though the water shortage is not as serious here as in L.A. (A3), 
people are getting concerned. . . . Tim Downs, partner in a leak detection 
service in Santa Ana, says business has increased over the last six months, due 
mostly to homeowners worried about wasting water. . . . The worst household 
offender: the home swimming pool, whose underground plumbing can invisibly leak 
hundreds of gallons a day. "It's easy to think the water's just evaporating," 
Downs said. Steve Emmons and Cristina Lee

POPULATION RISES 2% IN ONE-YEAR PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's population grew 2% last year after 46,800 more people moved in, 
mostly in the unincorporated areas, according to the latest state statistics 
released in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Population estimates released Wednesday show that between January, 1989, and 
January of this year, the county' population grew from 2,279,400 to 2,326,200. 
Fueled by births and incoming residents, the unincorporated areas of Orange 
County absorbed 20,400 of the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Cities showing the biggest gains were Yorba Linda (4,500), Anaheim (3,600), 
Huntington Beach (3,000), Tustin (2,650) and Mission Viejo (2,000). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana showed a loss of 1,200 residents. The cities of Fullerton, La Palma 
and Villa Park showed no gain.

TRUCKS DUMP EXTRA LOAD ON FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be surprised if today's commute along the Costa Mesa and San Diego 
freeways is heavier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
For the next eight weeks, trucks carrying hundreds of thousands of cubic yards 
of dirt will make 700 daily trips between two construction projects in the 
already congested area during peak traffic hours. 
</P>
<P>
A construction company had first hoped to avoid rush hour by doing most of its 
hauling at night, but officials at the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air 
Station refused to allow the company to work after 11 p.m., forcing the 
contractor complete the job during the day. 
</P>
<P>
E.L. Yeager Construction of Tustin is in the process of excavating 800,000 
cubic yards of dirt from the site of the Costa Mesa Freeway extension in Costa 
Mesa. Most of that dirt is being taken about six miles north to Tustin, where 
the company is building an extension to Jamboree Road between Barranca Parkway 
and Edinger Avenue, according to Kyrk Reid, Yeager's area manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamboree Road extension runs through the air station and is only 1,500 feet 
from housing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Base commanders could not be reached for comment, but Irvine and Tustin city 
officials said the Marines were concerned about the noise of nighttime 
construction. Construction was halted at 11 p.m. because that is the time 
helicopters on the base stop operating. 
</P>
<P>
For the last month, Yeager construction employees stopped work at the Jamboree 
site at 11 p.m. but had hoped that working hours would eventually be extended 
into the early morning, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, hauling the dirt will be extended in the morning rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sympathetic to having the trucks off the road during the day, but (the 
Marines) have their own people to worry about too," said Sam Johnson, the city 
of Tustin's projects manager. "It's sort of like being caught between a rock 
and a hard place. . . . You can see both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Russ Thiele, Irvine's projects manager, said that having the 
construction done at night would be desirable but both cities agreed to go 
along with the decision to halt work at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Reid said he could understand the air station's position but was disappointed 
that nothing could be done to keep the trucks off the road during peak traffic 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"With the congestion and the certain dangers involved, we hoped to move the 
materials when they would have the least impact on the public," Reid said. "We 
hoped something could have been worked out."SHELBY GRAD

Question: What's cheaper than a ride on Orange County's new commuter train? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The whole train. 
</P>
<P>
The county's fledgling commuter rail service picked up a used, double-deck 
train in Northern California on Wednesday for $1 a year, far less than the $14 
round-trip ticket price passengers will pay for riding it between San Juan 
Capistrano and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in San Mateo, the Peninsula Corridor Study Joint Powers Board agreed 
Wednesday to give a surplus train to the Orange County Transportation 
Commission for a buck. The board oversees the CalTrain commuter service, which 
is operated by the California Department of Transportation between San Jose and 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
CalTrain runs 48 trains each day in the Bay Area at a financial loss. 
</P>
<P>
So why charge OCTC only $1? 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials argued successfully that they were merely transferring a 
train they already own to another location in order to relieve the congestion 
on the Santa Ana Freeway during Caltrans' own $1.6-billion freeway widening 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Made by a Japanese company but assembled in the United States, the train to be 
given to OCTC within the next four weeks was first put into service in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC inaugurated its commuter rail service Monday, contracting with Amtrak to 
run the service between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles, with stops in 
between. About 150 people rode the morning train on Wednesday. They arrived 
early for the third day in a row, OCTC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's action in San Mateo will save OCTC about $250,000. The savings will 
be used to purchase more train equipment or improve existing rail service, OCTC 
spokesman Tom Fortune said.JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

$112,347 ON ITS WAY FOR MEASLES FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The California Department of Health Services released $1.2 million in emergency 
funds Wednesday to deal with what health officials say is the worst measles 
epidemic in the state in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Among the hardest hit by the epidemic have been Los Angeles and Orange 
counties, which will receive $300,000 and $112,347 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
California health officials said the state death toll from measles for the 
first four months of this year has already surpassed the number of deaths due 
to measles for all of 1989. Measles has claimed 30 lives -- two in Orange 
County -- so far this year, contrasted with 20 the year before, health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There were 2,269 cases of the disease reported from January through April this 
year; for all of last year 3,048 cases were reported. Toddlers and other young 
children are most often the victims of the disease, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite serious," said Jaime Arteaga, a spokesman for the California 
Department of Health Services. "It's because the children have not been 
immunized. We're seeing a lot of cases among lower-income and migrant 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty jurisdictions throughout the state will divide the funding, which is 
expected to reach local health agencies within the next two or three weeks. The 
money may be used to pay for increasing immunization services by expanding 
clinic staffs, hours of operation and locations of service. Funding may also be 
used to provide transportation to and from the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The aid is being provided from the state's Special Needs and Priorities -- 
commonly known as SNAP -- funds, money that is left over from the fiscal year 
and made available for health emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a shortage of vaccine earlier this year, health officials said they are 
confident there will be enough through the end of the year. Merck, Sharp &amp; 
Dohme, the manufacturer of the vaccine, has assured the state that the company 
"will meet all anticipated demands through 1990," Arteaga said. ROSE ELLEN

WOMAN TO BE TRIED IN MERCEDES DEATH 
</P>

<P>
Betty Y. Davies, accused of killing her stepdaughter's husband with a 
Mercedes-Benz sedan last year, was ordered Wednesday to stand trial for 
involuntary manslaughter and hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing almost three days of testimony, Municipal Judge Susanne S. Shaw 
concluded that there was enough evidence to try the Newport Beach resident for 
the death of James R. Ward, 31, of Costa Mesa, who was fatally injured six days 
before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Davies, 58, allegedly struck Ward with her car about 8 p.m. on Dec. 19 during a 
confrontation with him and his wife, Wendy, outside the couple's home in the 
800 block of Congress Street. Ward, the father of two children, sustained 
severe head injuries and died four days later at Hoag Hospital in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw scheduled Davies' arraignment in Superior Court for May 11 and concluded 
Wednesday's proceedings by saying, "Good luck to you." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on both felony counts, the defendant could face a maximum penalty 
of seven years in prison. Davies, who was arrested a day after the incident, 
remains free on $75,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum, the prosecutor, contended during the 
preliminary hearing that Davies was confronted by the Wards after a neighbor 
spotted her spying on their home from across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony indicated that the couple persistently asked Davies why she was there 
and escorted her to her car, parked a few doors away. Davies, the evidence 
suggested, did not answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Ward, the only eyewitness to the incident, recalled that Davies ran her 
husband down without warning or provocation as he stood about two feet in front 
of the Mercedes 500 SEL. He was carried on the hood some distance down the 
block before he fell into the street and Davies drove off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was yelling at Jim to move," Wendy Ward testified. "She started the car. I 
heard the motor racing. Then she hit him. He had no chance to move." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Marshall Schulman, seeking to have the charges reduced or 
dismissed, contended that James Ward was enraged by Davies' appearance and 
struck her automobile several times with a cordless telephone before Davies 
panicked and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tragedy all the way around," Schulman said. "There may be other 
reasons why my client was there -- good motives as opposed to bad. Then 
unfortunate things happened." 
</P>
<P>
To Schulman, the evidence suggested that Ward might have been on the hood of 
the Mercedes pounding on the windshield and was hurt when he fell from the car 
onto the street as it drove away. Davies, he said, probably did not know he was 
injured. DAN WEIKEL

YOUTH CRITICAL AFTER ELECTRICAL SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Santa Ana boy remained in critical condition Wednesday after a 
metal radio tower he was trying to install came in contact with a 12,000-volt 
power line, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two others who were involved in Tuesday's incident were hospitalized and listed 
in serious condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief John Chambers of the Santa Ana Fire Department said the bolt of 
electricity that surged through Sergio Olguin stopped his heart. The 
electricity burst holes in his hands and feet as it exited his body. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics revived him before rushing him to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital 
and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Olguin, his 17-year-old brother, Caesar, and a friend, Carlos Mangana, 24, were 
installing a 48-foot radio tower at their home on the 2000 block of Elder 
Street when the metal structure toppled into a power line. 
</P>
<P>
The Olguins' 21-year-old sister, Ana, said the bolt of electricity threw Caesar 
Olguin and Mangana in some nearby bushes. The tower crashed to the ground, 
pinning Sergio's leg, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers said Sergio suffered serious burns. Doctors were attempting to 
determine the extent of injuries to his vital organs. At UCI, doctors were 
conducting similar tests on Caesar Olguin and Mangana, who both suffered 
second- and third-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Olguin, the father of Sergio and Caesar Olguin, did not have a permit 
for the antenna the young men were trying to install, fire officials said. He 
had planned to set up a citizens band radio to use in his towing business, Ana 
Olguin said.DAVAN MAHARAJ

OFFICIALS VISIT IRVINE CO.'S 'WEST BOWL' SITE 
</P>

<P>
City leaders, urban planners and representatives of the Irvine Co. stood on a 
gentle slope east of the city Wednesday and gazed at the future. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a study session and tour of part of the 7,100 acres designated 
in the East Orange Specific Plan, a proposed amendment to the city's general 
plan that would increase the city's population by 40% over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
City Council and Planning Commission members boarded two white vans to tour the 
1,490-acre "West Bowl," the western-most parcel of the Irvine Co. project and 
the first of four phases scheduled for development. 
</P>
<P>
The West Bowl is considered to be the most intense phase of the project, partly 
because it includes the Eastern Transportation Corridor, a six- to eight-lane 
road traversing 13 miles through the heart of the area, said Vernon Jones, 
administrator of the city's Community Planning Division.The road will join the 
Riverside Freeway to the north and the Laguna Highway to the south, with 
interchanges at Handy Street, Chapman Avenue and Santiago Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The West Bowl will also include a town center, elementary school, two parks, 
several commercial and business-industrial areas and open space. Development 
will be confined to below ridgelines, said Steve Ross, a planner for the Irvine 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the environmental impact report for the East Orange 
project last December. Opponents of the plan say the massive development will 
cause traffic congestion and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is scheduled for adoption by the council in late 1991, with grading 
and construction to begin in 1994, planners said.MARY HELEN BERG

FIRST-GRADER SNAGS $2,000 SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>

Somer Flaherty was born more than 100 years after Nellie Bly, one of 
journalism's most notable female pioneers. But 7-year-old Somer, who will be 
awarded a college scholarship by her local girls club later this month, is 
determined to follow in Bly's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be a news reporter," the first-grader wrote on the application 
for a $2,000 award. "I tell everyone everything, and my nickname at home is 
roving reporter." 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty was chosen from more than 50 applicants for the first annual "She 
Knows Where She's Going" scholarship, offered by the Newport Mesa Girls Club. 
The money will be placed in a trust and made available to Somer in the year 
2000, when she graduates from high school, said Susan Kline, a spokeswoman for 
the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Somer says, she will practice for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"All the time, my mom says why don't you go and write stuff down while you're 
waiting," Somer said. "I write stories about animals and insects, butterflys 
and spiders." 
</P>
<P>
Along with making up stories, she also covers the news of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"One time I wrote about my mom, when she took my next-door neighbor's cat to 
the vet because it got hit by a car, but it didn't die," Somer said. The 
neighbor, she said, enjoyed the story. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Oh, this is such a good story, I have to keep it,' " Somer said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges considered four elements when reviewing the anonymous applications, 
Kline said. They looked at the youngster's maturity, academic achievements, 
extracurricular activities and the family's financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations were solicited from second-grade teachers at every public and 
private school in the area, Kline said, and were also available to parents 
through the Girls Club. On the application, the children were asked to write 
essays or draw pictures and file letters from teachers and family friends 
giving information about the child. LAURA MICHAELIS

VETERAN SCHONERT WAIVED BY BENGALS 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backup quarterback Turk Schonert was waived Wednesday by the Cincinnati 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Schonert, a graduate of Servite High School, was the Chicago Bears' ninth-round 
draft pick in 1980 and came to the Bengals in 1981 on waivers. 
</P>
<P>
He spent eight seasons with the Bengals and one season with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
In nine NFL seasons, Schonert attempted 495 passes and had 311 completions for 
3,788 yards and 11 touchdowns, and was intercepted 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-year NFL veteran Paul Moyer, who started 16 games at strong safety for 
Seattle in 1988, has retired because of a ruptured disc in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Knox said Moyer, a Villa Park High School graduate, will become a 
coaching assistant with the Seahawks and help with the team's secondary. The 
Seahawks opened their minicamp Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer played 11 games as a backup to starter Nesby Glasgow last season. He 
spent the last five weeks of the 1989 season on injured reserve because of his 
ailing neck. 
</P>
<P>
Signed as a rookie free agent from Arizona State in 1983, Moyer spent his first 
five seasons in Seattle as Kenny Easley's backup. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer played in 98 games in his Seahawks' career, starting 27 of them. He had 
11 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams added to their collection of Big Ten quarterbacks by acquiring Chuck 
Long from the Detroit Lions for an undisclosed draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Long, a first-round draft choice by the Lions in 1986, will compete with Mark 
Herrmann for the backup spot to Rams' starter Jim Everett. Long played at Iowa; 
Herrmann and Everett at Purdue.

VITAMINS FIRM MUST TREAD LIGHTLY IN ADS; 
</P>
<P>
NUTRITION: A CHATSWORTH SUPPLEMENT COMPANY MUST ADHERE TO STRICT FDA RULES IN 
ITS PRODUCT CLAIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late-night radio talk show host Larry King is reading an advertisement. "Ester 
C . . . a remarkable development in vitamin C," he exclaims. "Enters the 
bloodstream twice as fast!" 
</P>
<P>
What King doesn't say in this ad for Natrol Inc.'s "Ester C" vitamin supplement 
is what many people who buy the product are probably thinking: Vitamin C has 
long been said to help stave off the common cold. 
</P>
<P>
It's left unsaid because Natrol, a Chatsworth-based nutritional supplements 
company, isn't allowed to make any cold-cure claims. 
</P>
<P>
Like cereal companies peddling oat bran flakes, Natrol and its president, 
Elliott Balbert, do business in a gray area, selling products that the 
government considers to be merely foods with no medicinal value. But consumers 
often buy them, like medicines, for their health. 
</P>
<P>
Natrol has grown fast lately, marketing about 20 specialty vitamin and 
nutrition concoctions like "Ester C," "Natrol High" ("The country's best picker 
upper!"), and "Oat Bran Fiber Caplets." Balbert predicts the company will do $5 
million in sales in the year ending this June, compared to about $2.5 million 
the previous year. So far this year profits have been running at 8% of sales, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Natrol is in a tricky business. Vitamin and nutritional supplements 
companies may describe how a product works or say what ingredients it contains, 
but they can't claim it can cure a disease or alleviate a symptom. Only drug 
companies with licensed drugs can claim that. 
</P>
<P>
Balbert admitted that he learned that lesson the hard way. In 1987, Natrol, 
like many similar companies, was selling an exotic product from Japan that 
contained organic germanium, a metallic element. In Natrol's magazine ads, the 
company repeated claims by a Japanese research institute founded to investigate 
the substance, that organic germanium could inhibit the growth of tumors. 
Balbert said he was satisfied by the research. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal Food and Drug Administration, he admitted, "took a very dim 
view of the marketing of germanium." Balbert said an agent of the FDA came to 
his plant in Chatsworth to demand that the company stop making those claims 
about organic germanium. Natrol agreed, and it also voluntarily destroyed a few 
cases of the product. 
</P>
<P>
Now Balbert calls the ordeal a "positive" experience because it taught him an 
important lesson about his business. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Natrol has become one of the better-known small companies in the 
health vitamin business. Natrol is a very savvy marketer, according to Tim 
Barringer, the nutrition director for Mrs. Gooch's food stores, which sell some 
Natrol products. "Elliott is a very enterprising fellow. He seems to have 
boundless energy," Barringer said. 
</P>
<P>
Natrol doesn't manufacture any of the substances it sells. It buys them from 
other companies, then packages and markets them. For instance, Natrol markets 
"Ester C" through an agreement with Inter-Cal, an Arizona company that 
manufactures the vitamin. 
</P>
<P>
The company also doesn't have the large research and development staff of a 
drug company. Natrol bought the rights to sell "Calms Kids" -- which it markets 
as a "nutritional formula" for unusually active children -- from Billy Jay 
Sahley, who founded and helps run a clinic in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Sahley said she developed the original formula as an alternative to drugs for 
treating hyperactivity and tested it on 250 children between 1983 and 1985. She 
proposed to Balbert that Natrol market the product. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the name, Natrol doesn't claim that "Calms Kids" is a hyperactivity 
cure. Instead, the company sells "Calms Kids" as "a nutritional formula for the 
active child," the idea being that busy kids need extra vitamins. But doesn't 
the product's name imply that it's a hyperactivity cure? "We do not want to 
imply that," Balbert said. If parents use "Calms Kids" for more than a vitamin 
supplement, "they and their physician would make that decision," Balbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even when a vitamin company's advertising claims are in order, it can still 
be a trying experience to market naturally occurring substances as nutritional 
supplements if they haven't been proven safe in government-approved tests. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Natrol's experience with "Calms Kids." 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, one of "Calms Kids" main ingredients was L-tryptophan, an 
amino acid found in some foods. For years, people have taken L-tryptophan to 
treat insomnia, depression -- and in children, hyperactivity. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last November, the FDA recalled L-tryptophan products that would result 
in dosages of more than 100 milligrams per day of L-tryptophan, because they 
had been linked to an outbreak of 30 cases of a rare blood condition that 
causes muscle pain, swelling and sometimes death. 
</P>
<P>
No one could be certain that L-tryptophan itself was to blame, but, then again, 
the amino acid had never been subject to the safety tests that drugs are put 
through in the United States. When cases of the blood disease continued to 
rise, the recall was expanded in March to include almost all L-tryptophan 
products. By last week the federal Centers for Disease Control said 1,478 cases 
of the blood disease linked to L-tryptophan had been reported, leading to 21 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Balbert said Natrol wasn't linked to any of the cases. The government hasn't 
named specific manufacturers linked to the outbreak.

Lord Cockfield, a former British Cabinet minister and architect of the planned 
economic unification of Western Europe in 1992, said U.S. companies are not 
moving fast enough to capitalize on emerging markets in the European Economic 
Community. 
</P>
<P>
"The window of opportunity for American companies is narrowing quickly as 1992 
nears," Cockfield said in an interview Wednesday. "While Japanese investments 
in the European Community have substantially increased in the last four years, 
many of which have been in high technology, the growth of American investment 
has been slow." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years alone, Japan's direct investment in the EEC tripled, from 
$9.1 billion in 1988 to $30 billion last year. U.S. investment, although larger 
than Japan's, has not shown any growth from about $126 billion in 1988, 
according to Aidan St. P. Walsh, the international director of KPMG Peat 
Marwick, the New York-based international accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you act quickly," he said, "you'll find your competitor sitting on your 
doorstep" because European Community companies are also expanding rapidly in 
the international market, particularly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cockfield made his remarks in an interview before a speech at the World Trade 
Center Assn.'s annual dinner meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
One area that Orange County companies can still capitalize on is Western 
Europe's booming information technology market, he said. While the EEC accounts 
for 30% of the world market in information technology, EEC companies have been 
able to supply only 11% of the market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cockfield developed plans for the European Community's economic unification 
while serving as vice president of the European Communities Commission. He is 
an expert on how economic and political policies coming out of the European 
Parliament in Brussels will affect the international market. Since leaving the 
EC Commission in 1988, he has been a special adviser to KPMG Peat Marwick 
McLintock, the U.K. affiliate of the accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Cockfield said he sees "no prospect" of the newly liberalized East European 
countries joining the EEC. 
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. companies trading with Eastern Europe should plan investments 
there separately from their involvement in Western Europe.

EECO FILES BANKRUPTCY FOR SOME SUBSIDIARIES

EECO Inc., the struggling computer accessories manufacturer, Wednesday sought 
protection from its creditors by placing several subsidiaries in Chapter 11 
bankruptcy in federal court here. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bonney, chairman of EECO, said the bankruptcy petition affects only the 
company's keyboard, switch and keypad divisions. Its hotel computer business 
unit, EECO Computer Inc., and keypad subsidiary in Scotland, EECO Ltd., were 
not included in the filing. 
</P>
<P>
Bonney said a list of assets and liabilities and major creditors was not 
available. But he noted the company's largest creditor was Sanwa Bank in Los 
Angeles, which loaned the company about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bonney said Sanwa Bank's decision in March to cease further funding of the 
company's restructuring plan, coupled with its inability to complete the sale 
of its Maxi-Switch Division, were the primary reasons the company sought court 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a deal to sell the switch division fell through after the company 
said the bank, which held liens on the assets, did not approve the transaction. 
Sanwa Bank officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the company stumbled in part because it could not compete 
with overseas computer parts makers, which had lower operating costs. Chapter 
11 allows a company to reorganize while developing a plan to repay its debts. 
EECO said it plans to continue operating and cut costs, particularly in its 
keyboard operation in Tuscon. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, which employs about 100 people, will be "significantly downsized" to 
focus primarily on higher margin custom keyboard production, Bonney said. He 
said he did not know exactly how many of the unit's employees would be laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
ECI did not file for bankruptcy because it operates as a separate, independent 
subsidiary. EECO Ltd., with headquarters in Scotland and serving the European 
market, is a separate company, governed by English law, and is not subject to 
the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
Bonney said significant progress toward a return to profitability had been made 
by the switch and keypad divisions in the first quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Bonney also announced that George B. DeHuff III, previously president of the 
switch division, will be president and chief executive officer of EECO Inc. and 
a member of the board of directors.

WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO THE WEATHER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everbody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not any more. These days, we're doing plenty about it. All that's needed are a 
few thousand miles of blacktop, a few thousand fewer trees, a few hundred 
thousand garden hoses and sprinkler heads and a few big buildings. In short, a 
city. 
</P>
<P>
And, before long, we're tinkering with the weather. 
</P>
<P>
We may not notice it day to day, but in Orange County we're hotter and more 
humid than we used to be. In fact, the last decade was the hottest in Orange 
County history. It is, say weather researchers and meteorologists, the price of 
urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago, the idea of slow-cooking the county would have seemed like 
science fiction. It was a time when Los Angeles was just beginning to discover 
smog and Orange County was still an agricultural backwater. Downtown Anaheim 
looked like a Norman Rockwell sketch. Disneyland was an orange grove. The South 
Coast Metro area was a series of bean fields. The total population of the 
county was 216,224. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the way it was for decades. It all made for usually pleasant, 
consistent weather, with the trees and crops acting as natural air 
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
But when planners and developers started taking the oranges out of Orange 
County -- along with thousands of acres of other vegetation -- and adding 
people, buildings, industry, roads, freeways, cars and a penchant for energy 
consumption, they also took the lid off the thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by a former California state climatologist, 
the mean annual temperature in Santa Ana -- near the geographic center of 
Orange County -- rose from slightly below 61 degrees in 1910 to between 65 and 
66 degrees in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
It's called the "urban heat island effect," and it occurs whenever an area 
becomes citified. 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature at the core of cities has a very simple mathematical 
relationship to the population," said Kenneth Watt, a professor of zoology at 
UC Davis. "Civilization has manufactured an oven." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, that oven has several components: 
</P>
<P>
* Blacktopping. "If you blacktop something, as we all know from trying to walk 
on it, it absorbs all the (heat) radiation that hits it," said F. Sherwood 
Rowland, Bren professor of chemistry at UCI and a specialist in global 
atmospheric problems. This, he said, causes the air close to the ground to heat 
up. Also, because the heat is absorbed into the blacktop, it can continue to 
radiate out into the surrounding air even after the sun goes down. 
</P>
<P>
* Concrete paving. Unlike blacktopping, white concrete paving reflects heat 
into the upper atmosphere or into lower altitudes where it is trapped by 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
* Large buildings. Depending on their color, these also serve as absorbers or 
reflectors of heat from the sun. In a larger sense, however, they warm the 
surrounding air as a result of what Ralph Cicerone, head of the UCI geosciences 
department, calls "waste heat." This heat, he said, is a byproduct of any 
machine: air conditioners, heaters, electric motors, gasoline engines. 
</P>
<P>
* Homes. While they do not produce the high concentration of waste heat that 
large buildings or industrial sites do, each machine used at home -- 
particularly the air conditioner -- causes the local temperature to rise. 
</P>
<P>
* Cars. That exhaust emissions produce ozone pollution is well-known. However, 
the engines also produce waste heat and water vapor. 
</P>
<P>
* Lack of trees and other vegetation. Orange County is no longer primarily an 
agricultural region, and hundreds of square miles of open land have been 
cleared for development in recent decades. This, weather researchers say, not 
only removes natural windbreaks, but also eliminates a source of natural air 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, these elements account for a local heating trend that is likely 
to continue for as long as Orange County grows, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Jim Goodridge, a former California state climatologist who now 
studies rainfall and climatic variation full time, the urban heat island effect 
is not exactly novel. The effect, he said, was first described in 1811 by an 
English scientist named Luke Howard, who reported on the rising temperatures in 
London as a result of urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
In more modern times, however, said Goodridge, the effect may be responsible 
for the birth -- erroneously -- of the global warming theory. Also called the 
greenhouse effect, the theory holds that atmospheric pollution from such 
sources as chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide are stripping away the 
earth's protective shield of ozone and causing temperatures to rise around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Goodridge, the global warming proponents' figures may be skewed 
because of unusually high temperatures in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
"When people have a large computer," he said, "and they gather up the world's 
temperature records, they feel that because they have so many records, they can 
average all the temperatures together and come up with a monumental 
representation of the world's true temperature. But they haven't separated out 
the rural temperature stations from the urban stations." 
</P>
<P>
Watt, an outspoken opponent of the global warming theory, calls it "pure 
baloney. It's a complete hoax, in my view. I would suggest that the perception 
that the world is getting warmer has been influenced by the fact that many of 
the thermometers that are being studied are in big cities and around airports. 
How you find the truth about global temperature is to look at what you find in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, the temperatures in the country -- away from urban centers -- 
have remained fairly constant, a condition that he claims debunks the global 
warming theory. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Watt said, the urban heat island effect and the man-made factors that 
influence it are quite real. 
</P>
<P>
What exactly have we done? 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the effects of development and urbanization might be 
illustrated using a model of, say, an industrial park with a large housing 
tract on one side, a golf course on the other, and a freeway running past it 
all. Assume that the area was once a huge orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
First, the trees were cleared and the ground leveled. And this alone, said 
Goodridge, was enough to affect the surrounding temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"In a modified climate where you don't have the heat (from the sun) being 
converted to plant tissue growth, it goes to heating the outside air," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, said Watt, "the reason that the countryside is cool is that most of the 
cooling in the world is a result of converting liquid to gas and gas into 
liquid -- because river and lake and stream and pond surfaces and surfaces of 
vegetation are converted to water vapor." 
</P>
<P>
Next in the evolution of the industrial/residential neighborhood were the 
structures themselves, houses and industrial buildings. Most of the industrial 
buildings were fitted with air-conditioning systems, and those that were not 
employed machines and other equipment that used a lot of energy -- in the form 
of both fossil fuels and electricity -- and therefore emitted a high 
concentration of waste heat and possibly air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
And, with the coming of the reflective or heat-absorbing walls in place of the 
heat-converting trees, the temperature of the surrounding air went up another 
notch. 
</P>
<P>
"All those buildings tend to generate heat, from food service, computers, 
lighting, air conditioning," said Charles Pyke, a meteorologist for the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers in Los Angeles and president of a private weather 
research and forecasting business. "And there's a certain amount of heat that 
escapes to the outside, through air-conditioning vents or through glass." 
</P>
<P>
The effects of this waste heat are felt most acutely at night, Pyke said. He 
estimates that in the highly urbanized areas of Los Angeles, the average 
nightly temperature has risen 12 to 13 degrees in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
The houses near the industrial park produced less waste heat, but they, too, 
provided reflecting surfaces and -- along with the golf course -- added another 
dimension to the alteration of the local weather: higher humidity. Back-yard 
pools, lawns in both front and back yards, and other landscaping that requires 
frequent watering, along with the large expanse of golf course land that often 
is watered daily, supplanted the more natural surroundings that were watered 
less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Under such conditions, said Pyke, a higher "dew point" -- a more accurate 
measure of moisture in the atmosphere than relative humidity -- often results. 
He said that effect has been noticed fairly dramatically in places like Palm 
Springs, where the frequent irrigation of large tracts of man-made greenbelts 
and golf courses is felt in the form of more humid weather in the hotter months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Pyke estimates that the dew point since Orange County became more urbanized has 
risen two or three degrees, which would make for an increase in relative 
humidity of about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, access streets were built, along with the freeway, and these also 
reflected or absorbed heat from the sun, adding to the rising temperatures. 
They also brought cars into the neighborhood, sometimes in large quantities. 
And the autos' effects, scientists say, can be dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Tailpipe emissions help heat the air and, because they contain a component of 
water vapor, also add to the humidity, Pyke said. 
</P>
<P>
"In places like Fairbanks, Alaska," said Pyke, "you can actually get dense ice 
fogs forming because of too many cars on the roads." 
</P>
<P>
Of greater concern than any weather trends, however, said Pyke and others, are 
the effects of air pollution -- even though on paper the figures show that the 
air quality in Orange County has improved in recent years, the result of more 
stringent controls on auto and industrial emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The air may be cleaner in Orange County today than it was, say, 15 years ago, 
but this trend will probably evaporate in the face of the county's ever-growing 
population and its need to travel by automobile, said David Rutherford, a 
spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
"The air quality has gradually improved since the late '70s," Rutherford said, 
"but it will be a challenge for us to continue that as the area grows, and, as 
a result, the carbon monoxide emissions from tailpipes increase. As the 
population grows, so will the demand for the use of the area's thoroughfares. 
That is the No. 1 source of air pollution." 
</P>
<P>
But does air pollution affect the weather? If vegetation is considered a 
moderating influence on local weather, then the answer is yes, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing for any plant is photosynthesis," said Dave Tingey, a researcher 
at the Environmental Protection Agency research laboratory in Corvallis, Ore. 
Tingey is leading a team that is studying the effects of ozone pollution on 
crops and forest vegetation. "(Ozone pollution) suppresses the rate of 
photosynthesis and affects the way the plant processes the photosynthesis. It 
also shortens the life of any given leaf, and the leaf is the (photosynthetic) 
factory of the plant. It also directly affects the pollination process. It 
inhibits the germination of pollen grains on the female portion of the flower." 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to reduced plant growth and a greater susceptibility to disease 
in the plant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The trees can be killed by a secondary infection. It's like in humans when 
something else gets you, but pneumonia kills you," Tingey said. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news: it isn't going to get any better. Orange County continues to boom 
and, according to researchers -- and the population/temperature equation -- 
that means the county will probably get hotter as long as development goes on. 
How bad it can get can be illustrated by the world's most populous city, 
Goodridge said. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see the temperature curve for Tokyo," he said. "It goes straight 
up. The temperature each year is higher than the one before." 
</P>
<P>
The good news: "It won't continue indefinitely," said Gunnar Roden, a research 
professor at the school of oceanography at the University of Washington in 
Seattle. "I would expect the temperature rise to stop when you reach a city 
growth plateau." 
</P>
<P>
When that plateau -- or saturation point -- is reached depends on how much 
discomfort in the form of higher temperatures and humidity and pollution Orange 
County residents are willing to live with, weather specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
One palliative measure, Goodridge said, is to plant more trees. But, said 
Rowland -- an advocate of the global warming theory -- "it's not sufficient to 
plant a seedling to make up for a 300-year-old tree." On a global scale, he 
said, "we'd need to plant an area the size of Australia because that's how many 
trees have been cut down around the world." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, he said, it may come down to money versus nature. 
</P>
<P>
"When it becomes more and more to people's economic advantage to become energy 
efficient," said Rowland, "they will do it more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
HOW WE CHANGE THE CLIMATE 
</P>
<P>
Several related causes, some seemingly insignificant, add up to long-term 
weather variations. 
</P>
<P>
Deforestation: Vegetation, particularly trees, reduces heat. Trees use solar 
energy for plant tissue growth, and when they disappear, their moderating 
effect on the surrounding temperature disappears with them. 
</P>
<P>
Energy use: Any source of energy -- fossil fuels, electricity, air conditioners 
-- emits heat. The more sources of energy, the more heat, particularly when 
industry or large buildings are the source. 
</P>
<P>
Blacktoping/Paving: When an area formerly covered with soil, plants and trees 
is paved, the pavement either reflects or absorbs heat. White concrete reflects 
heat into the upper air; blacktop absorbs it and radiates it out into the air 
closer to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Emissions: Cars and industrial emissions create air pollution, which affects 
plant growth and the ability to cool the surrounding air. Water vapor produced 
from auto tailpipes also causes the humidity to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Development: Man-made lakes artificially watered grass in yards, parks and golf 
courses, as well as residential swimming pools, cause a rise in humidity. Air 
conditioners also contribute. 
</P>
<P>
POPULATION 
</P>
<P>
More people equals more heat. The more Orange County grows, the hotter it's 
going to get. And the temperature likely will continue to rise until we reach 
the population/development saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
1980: 1.9 million 
</P>
<P>
1990 (Estimate): 2.3 million 
</P>
<P>
2000 (Estimate): 2.6 million 
</P>
<P>
AIR POLLUTION'S IMPACT ON THE CLIMATE 
</P>
<P>
Air pollution affects the climate by damaging crops and plants that in turn 
affect the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone and other harmful pollutants are released into the air from cars and 
factories. These emissions reach trees, crops and other plants we depend on for 
natural air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
HOW OZONE AFFECTS PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN PLANTS: 
</P>
<P>
Normally, carbon dioxide is absorbed into the plant through leaf cells called 
stomates, where it is eventually converted into plant tissue and oxygen. When 
ozone invades the plant, the stomates respond to the attack by one of two ways. 
If they stay open, the leaf cell membranes are permeated and damaged by the 
ozone. The leaf's heat-absorbing capability is diminished. If the stomates 
close in response to the ozone -- as they do in some plants -- life-giving 
carbon dioxide can't get in. In either case, if the ozone is heavy enough, 
photosythesis stops and the plant dies. 
</P>
<P>
CROP DAMAGE 
</P>
<P>
Crops can be damaged or have their yields lowered by smog. One experiment at UC 
Riverside found that among varieties of sweet corn that were usually 
susceptible to damage from smog, the damage was even greater when the 
temperature rose. 
</P>
<P>
AREA MOST AFFECTED BY CHANGE 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County has yet to experience the degree of weather change felt by 
cities like Los Angeles (heat) and Palm Springs (humidity), there is a trend 
here toward higher temperatures and humidity. 
</P>
<P>
Urban areas with large concentrations of buildings experience the most change. 
Inland cities like Anaheim, Santa Ana and Orange, where trees have been 
replaced by concrete surfaces, tend to be hotter than coastal cities.

JOSEPH N. BELL: INFAMOUS DEATH MARCH AND FALL OF BATAAN STILL ECHO ACROSS THE 
YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those of you of my generation may remember, when reminded -- and others may 
recall from the quick dust-off given American history in schools these days -- 
that during this week 48 years ago, the American soldiers defending the 
Philippine Islands were pushed back to a place called the Bataan Peninsula 
where they were decimated and the remnants captured by the Japanese. The final 
American bastion was a fortress called Corregidor, two miles off Bataan. The 
main American force surrendered on April 9, and the final holdouts on 
Corregidor almost a month later. 
</P>
<P>
In between took place an event that became a rallying cry for all Americans 
during the rest of World War II: the Bataan Death March. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 Filipino and 12,000 American soldiers were taken prisoner by 
the Japanese on Bataan. Hurt, hungry and exhausted, they were forced to march 
to a prison camp 55 miles away. As a direct result of the contempt and 
brutality of their Japanese captors along the way, almost 10,000 of these 
prisoners died during that forced march. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Douglas MacArthur was rescued to fight another day -- that's when he made 
his famous pledge, "I shall return" -- but there was no rescue possible for the 
troops he led. In the spring of 1942, the United States was in no condition to 
send reinforcements to Bataan. We could only watch helplessly as our troops 
were killed or captured. 
</P>
<P>
This history has a special meaning for me, and I play the same drama over in my 
head every year when I read the inevitable anniversary stories. The details are 
graven into my memory because in the summer of 1945 I flew the first group of 
released Death March prisoners back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
MacArthur, of course, did return as he had promised, wading ashore on the 
Philippine island of Leyte on Oct. 20, 1944 -- several times, as a matter of 
fact, so press cameras could record the moment properly -- at the head of a 
U.S. invasion force. 
</P>
<P>
It took three months of hard fighting before the Americans pushed the Japanese 
into northern Luzon -- and in the process overran the prison camp in which the 
Bataan Death March survivors had been held. Our liberated prisoners spent 
several months in hospitals and rest camps before we started flying them home, 
triumphant symbols that the books were finally being balanced in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, I was a pilot assigned to the Naval Air Transport Service in the 
South Pacific, and when I reported to my squadron on the morning of June 27, 
1945, to fly a trip from John Rogers Field in Hawaii to NAS Oakland, I found I 
had a very special planeload of passengers. My crew would be carrying the first 
load of Bataan Death March survivors to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
We were busy in the cockpit and couldn't watch them come aboard. But I remember 
flashes of gaunt, emaciated men, and I was acutely aware of silence as they 
filed onto the plane. There was none of the exuberance we had seen so often of 
GIs going home. Just an eerie, almost opaque silence. 
</P>
<P>
Back in those primitive days, it took our DC-4 almost nine hours to make the 
trip from Oahu to Oakland, and all my latent journalistic juices began flowing 
as soon as we pulled up the landing gear. As soon as I decently could, I left 
the controls to my co-pilot and walked back into the cabin. I wanted to hear, 
firsthand, what these men had experienced over the past three years. I wanted a 
graphic description of the Death March. I wanted to know what they were feeling 
now on their way home. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin was silent as I wandered through it, looking into faces, trying to 
make eye contact so I could hunker down in the aisle and talk. None of the men 
looked at me. Most of them looked straight ahead or stared out the window at 
the expanse of sky and sea. I finally found an empty seat, sat down and tried 
to start a conversation with the man next to me. 
</P>
<P>
What happened was repeated several times before I finally returned to the 
flight deck. The men were polite, soft spoken and monosyllabic. Sometimes they 
looked at me blankly when I asked anything but the simplest question. They 
clearly had no interest in talking -- at least with me -- about what had 
happened to them. And I tried enough of them to convince me that this lack of 
response was probably not going to change. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the cockpit, I thought about this. 
</P>
<P>
Had their experiences been so traumatizing that they simply rejected the pain 
of bringing them up again? Or were they so overwhelmed at actually being only a 
few hours from home that they didn't want anything to interfere with those 
feelings? Or were they unwilling -- or perhaps unable -- to share their 
experiences with a stranger who had no common ground for understanding what 
they had been through? 
</P>
<P>
I still don't know. 
</P>
<P>
We found a rare clear day when we reached San Francisco, and we had a little 
fuel left. So we brought our passengers forward into the cockpit a half-dozen 
at a time and flew over and around the city so they could drink it in. They 
seemed appreciative, and they looked hungrily out the windows. But there was no 
shouting, no exhilaration, no letting go. 
</P>
<P>
Almost five decades later, I can still recall those faces as vividly as when I 
walked down the aisle of that airplane. These men were on their way home, where 
they would be seen as heroes, larger-than-life survivors of America's last holy 
war. But perhaps they had seen too much of man's brutality to permit them to 
let the good times back in. I've wondered many times since when -- if ever -- 
they did.

ART OF DINING: 3,979 CALORIES; 
</P>
<P>
AN 8-COURSE MEAL RAISES $200,000 FOR MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The next day, they swam laps, jogged on the beach, exercycled, Nautilized, 
Stairmastered or otherwise atoned. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. Or maybe they napped, with visions of raspberry cinnamon souffle tart 
with caramel sauce dancing in their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever they did on Monday, the 450 guests of Sunday's Art of Dining III 
surely reflected on the marathon gourmet meal that slid down their gullets the 
night before. And the wine (maybe they munched a few aspirin) that complemented 
each course. 
</P>
<P>
"For all the health-conscious people," chef Joachim Splichal told the banquet 
crowd, as dessert was served, "the calorie count of (this meal) is 3,979." 
</P>
<P>
A few groans answered Splichal's arithmetic, a ripple of laughter rose from the 
tables, then the happy clinking of silverware on plates resumed. 
</P>
<P>
As it has in previous years, the three-hour, eight-course food fest -- hosted 
by the Business Council of the Newport Harbor Art Museum -- took place in the 
Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. The $250-per-person benefit raised an 
estimated $200,000 for museum exhibitions and collections, thanks to a $100,000 
underwriting gift from Judie and George Argyros. 
</P>
<P>
Splichal, owner of L.A.'s Patina restaurant, coordinated the culinary efforts 
of nine other chefs, with technical assists from a hotel staff that included 24 
line cooks, five executive stewards and 55 servers, according to Jose Barragan, 
director of banquets. 
</P>
<P>
Annotating the proceedings, emcee Michael Mondavi set a pleasantly irreverent 
tone, veering from quirky personal comments ("Isn't nepotism great?" the wine 
scion began) to an insider's critique of the liquid portions of the meal. 
</P>
<P>
The fume blanc accompanying the eggplant caviar appetizer was said by Mondavi 
to have "crispness and life." The Pinot Noir served with the truffle-seasoned 
pasta dish was said to be "very velvety and very soft," while a "more 
structured and more intense" Cabernet Sauvignon was poured with the roasted 
lamb chop entree. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who never thought of a drink as having a "structure" could 
appreciate Mondavi's description of the vin served with dessert. "In Napa, we 
call this the navel wine," he said, because it "should be consumed from the 
navel of a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Before each course, the chef who dreamed up the dish stood rather uncomfortably 
in front of a closed-circuit camera in the kitchen holding a sample serving. 
Two huge screens in the banquet hall relayed the image of a smiling chef before 
the cameraman zoomed in for a Big Brotherish close-up of the food, which 
hovered over the black-tie crowd while a small army of white-gloved waiters 
marched from the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Splichal enlisted colleagues Susan Spicer of Bayona in New Orleans; Charlie 
Trotter of Charlie Trotter's in Chicago; Christopher Gross of Christopher's in 
Phoenix; Pierre Herme of Fauchon in Paris; Hubert Keller of Fleur De Lys in San 
Francisco; Michel Galloyer of Le Trianon in Angers France; Andre Mandion of 
Mandion in Anglet Saint-Jean, France; Debra Ponzek of Montrachet in New York; 
and Michel Pieton executive chef of the Newport Beach Four Seasons Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner was co-chaired by Samuel Goldstein and Samuel Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Joan and Don Beall, Marion and Jack Shea, Berdie and Harry 
Bubb, Susan and Timothy Strader, Kathryn Thompson and Gus Owen, Elizabeth and 
Tom Tierney, Pat and Dick Allen, Janice and Roger Johnson, Deeann and Al 
Baldwin, and Lee West, who donated a Jaguar that was sticker-priced $57,910 and 
bought by the Bubbs in a between-courses live auction for $54,000. 
</P>
<P>
Back to Nature: The Museum of Natural History and Science drew more than 600 
guests to a private slice of South County wilderness on Saturday for "A Nature 
Affair" -- an afternoon fund-raiser and educational event featuring guided 
nature walks, a steel drum band and a Mexican fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
Held on a sunbaked five-acre campground in San Juan Capistrano -- part of 
Rancho Mission Viejo, the vast O'Neill family holdings -- the $40-per-person 
($10 for kids) benefit raised an estimated $20,000 for the museum, according to 
Executive Director Dudley Varner. 
</P>
<P>
Guests got their first taste of nature when they pulled off Ortega Highway onto 
the mile of gravel road leading to "Campos de los Amantes" (roughly, "Lovers 
Fields") -- the taste, smell and feel of dust billowing up to their windows. 
</P>
<P>
After parking in the tall grass outside the fenced-in campground, the nature 
lovers headed to the canteen for sodas, beer, wine and margaritas, then toured 
exhibits set in the shade of California oaks on the perimeter of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Native plants and trees brought by a local nursery were on display, as were 
butterflies, spiders, silkworms, turtles and seven raptors from the Orange 
County Bird of Prey Center in Villa Park (one of whom, an adult male 
great-horned owl, was ceremonially set free at day's end). 
</P>
<P>
Paul Apodaca, curator of folk art at the Bowers Museum, told folk tales and 
Indian stories. Kristin Clark demonstrated the hand spinning of wool, cotton 
and flax. Other booths featured basket weavers, native jewelry and experts on 
subjects ranging from earthquakes and liquefaction to Orange County mountain 
lions. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Berment and the Despers performed Caribbean music. A late-afternoon lunch 
of Mexican specialties from the nearby O'Neill-owned El Adobe restaurant was 
served buffet-style. 
</P>
<P>
Varner said the museum, which now operates in a 7,000-square foot temporary 
location in Newport Beach, will move to another centrally located site this 
summer, where it will remain for several years until a permanent residence is 
built on county-donated land in the planned community of Aliso Viejo.

IT WON'T BE THE BEST RACE LEMOND HAS HAD; 
</P>
<P>
BICYCLE RACING: TOUR DE FRANCE WINNER ISN'T FEELING WELL AGAIN HEADING INTO THE 
TOUR DE TRUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"As the Wheel Turns" continues with Greg LeMond . . . 
</P>
<P>
We last left our intrepid cyclist facing a calamitous series of events after 
becoming the first American to win the Tour de France in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He was shot in April of 1987 while hunting turkeys near Sacramento. About two 
months later he had an appendectomy, and his 1987 season was ruined. His 
training for 1988 went smoothly until he crashed in a race at Belgium in May. 
He had arthroscopic surgery, and again raced poorly. 
</P>
<P>
He returned last year only to discover he had an iron deficiency that left him 
listless early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
In last summer's Tour de Italy, LeMond struggled even on small hills. 
</P>
<P>
"At one point in that race, I was so close to quitting for good," he told 
journalist James Raia. "You don't know how close." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Tour de France, in which LeMond overcame a 50-second deficit on 
the final day to defeat Laurent Fignon of France in one of the year's most 
compelling moments in sport. 
</P>
<P>
He finished the summer by winning the road race World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Ready for 1990? 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, 28, started the European season 15 pounds overweight. He entered 25 
races in five weeks beginning in February, but had to bypass most of the spring 
season after contracting a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was a bizarre incident in which LeMond's custom-made cycling shoes 
were stolen before a race. His stock replacements gave him sore feet. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who resides in Kortrijk, Belgium, went to his U.S. home in Wayzata, 
Minn., to recover and prepare for the Tour de Trump, an 11-day race that starts 
today at Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
He was feeling better before entering last weekend's 54-mile duPont Pro Cycling 
Series tuneup at Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
But LeMond arrived in Washington last Thursday complaining of hay fever. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the race started Sunday, he was suffering from food poisoning, said 
Nathan Jenkins, his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
With 11 laps left, LeMond dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who signed a three-year contract estimated at $5.5 million with 
French-based Z team after last summer's dramatic Tour de France victory, 
skipped Wednesday's news conference in Wilmington because he was still 
recuperating in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"He has not had a great beginning because of all the pressures," Jenkins said 
from Reno. 
</P>
<P>
"He will try to accommodate everyone, and that makes it difficult to train at 
the same time. He'll never say no to the public. He'll sign every autograph. 
But that always wears you down in a sport that requires such high levels of 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"But Greg seems to thrive on adversity. When he seems to be having his most 
problems he does his best." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, do not discount LeMond's power of recuperation. But none of the 
experts think he has much chance of winning the second Tour de Trump, a 
1,107-mile race ending in Boston May 13. LeMond finished 27th last year, his 
worst placing in 10 years of professional racing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Viatcheslav Ekimov of Leningrad and Steve Bauer of Ontario, Canada, are 
considered the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
The 133-rider field includes former Tour of Switzerland and Tour of Italy 
champion Andy Hampsten of Boulder, Colo.; Bauer, a three-time top-10 finisher 
in the Tour de France; Raul Alcala of Monterey, Mexico, who placed eighth in 
the 1989 Tour de France, and 1984 Olympic road race champion Alexi Grewal of 
Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
Ten professional teams, including the powerful PDM and Panasonic-Sportlife, 
both of the Netherlands, and nine seven-member amateur teams representing the 
United States, Canada, France, New Zealand, Sweden, West Germany and the Soviet 
Union are entered. 
</P>
<P>
The tour, modeled after European-style racing, has a 3.1-mile prologue in 
Wilmington and 13 stages. The tour has circuit races in Lehigh Valley, Pa., and 
New York, eight road races, a team time trial in Richmond, Va., a criterium in 
Baltimore, and an individual time trial in Lehigh Valley. The cyclist with the 
lowest total time will win. 
</P>
<P>
Although in its second year, the Tour de Trump is championed as the United 
States' premier bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people said we pulled off a miracle last year," said Michael Plant, 
the tour's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
That might not be an exaggeration considering Americans' lack of interest in 
serious cycling. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the townsfolk of such cities as Allentown, Pa., lined their streets 
in European tradition to cheer Tour de Trump competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the riders were caught off guard by the entire event last year," Plant 
said. "We knew that this was an opportunity that cycling was hoping for for 15 
years. I wasn't going to waste that." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ostentatious name, the formula seemed to work. And perhaps because 
of the name, it continues to gain recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition dictates these races are named after respective countries, not 
billionaire sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
But Donald Trump's empire provided sound backing to lure Europe's best teams. 
And his personal problems -- Marla Maples, Ivana Trump and all that -- bring 
added attention. 
</P>
<P>
If it is true that there is no such thing as bad publicity, then the Tour de 
Trump is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
The race -- and name -- was proposed by basketball announcer Billy Packer and 
Plant, an executive with the U.S. Cycling Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was initially stated, I practically fell out of my seat," Trump once 
said. "I said, 'Are you kidding? I will get killed in the media if you use that 
name.' " 
</P>
<P>
But after a pause, Trump added, "It's so wild, it's got to work." 
</P>
<P>
Plant said the name will stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all extremely comfortable," he said. "Two people made an impact in world 
of cycling last year -- Greg LeMond and Donald Trump." 
</P>
<P>
The fact the tour offers $250,000 in prize money has helped. 
</P>
<P>
But besides the money, Plant said the cyclists appreciated the care they 
received, a facet he plans to continue. 
</P>
<P>
And they enjoyed the ride. Cyclists found the East Coast countryside to be one 
of the tour's most engaging elements. This year's race will traverse the 
Catskill, Pocono and Blue Ridge mountains. It connects such quaint towns as 
Charlottesville, Va., Lehigh Valley, and New Paltz, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Europe's cyclists are used to riding the rough Alpine terrain of France, Italy 
and Switzerland. The difficulty of the Trump course surprised them. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, the hill work ended at Charlottesville, Va., and the final 
stages were relatively flat. Plant said competitors complained the finish was 
too easy and gave early leaders an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers agreed, and changed the course. Now, the tour's most feared ascent 
-- the Devil's Kitchen -- comes during the second-to-last stage. 
</P>
<P>
The three-mile stretch of country road in southern New York has a 15% grade and 
peaks at 1,840 feet. Some of last year's competitors walked up the grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it looks harder at the end this year," said Dag Otto Lauritzen of 
Norway, last year's winner who suffered a broken bone in his hand when he 
crashed in Belgium in March. 
</P>
<P>
"We've created an entirely new event and route," Plant said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the revamped course succeeds will be better known after Sunday's stage 
from Richmond to Charlottesville. The riders will face their first hills in the 
Blue Ridge Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
After that, they have a week's more racing before they can say it is all 
downhill. 
</P>

CLIPPERS TALK TO FRATELLO; TARKANIAN DENIES INTEREST

Mike Fratello, one of the biggest names available, on Wednesday became the 
first person to meet with both owner Donald T. Sterling and General Manager 
Elgin Baylor regarding the Clippers' coaching vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
Fratello, who announced days after the conclusion of the regular season that he 
would not seek a new contract to continue as coach of the Atlanta Hawks, could 
not be reached for comment. But it is believed the Clippers consider him a 
leading candidate to replace Don Casey. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas Coach Jerry Tarkanian dismissed a report in Wednesday's Times 
linking him to the Clipper coaching job as having "absolutely no truth." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said he has no intention of seeking the job, and said the report he 
would meet with Sterling about the vacancy "makes me sick." 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no truth to that at all," Tarkanian said. "It just amazes 
me that someone would write something like that and not even check with me 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling referred all questions to Baylor, who could not be reached. The 
general manager has no set timetable to name a new coach, only that he would 
like the matter to be completed before the June 27 draft. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Casey, unwanted by the Clippers, continues to draw interest 
elsewhere on a couple of levels. 
</P>
<P>
He met again Wednesday with officials from George Washington University in 
Washington, D.C., about the Colonials' coaching vacancy. He is regarded as a 
leading candidate along with Boston University's Mike Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
Casey was on an original list of 15 candidates that also included Bob Staak, 
one of his assistants last season with the Clippers, but Staak has since 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Casey is among five being considered for the top basketball 
front-office job with the Denver Nuggets, a to-be-determined title along the 
lines of general manager or director of player personnel, the Rocky Mountain 
News reported. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he has not been contacted by Denver, whose new president, Carl 
Scheer, will oversee business operations.

BROKEN HAND TO SIDELINE DUCKWORTH FOR PLAYOFFS 
</P>

From Associated Press

<P>
Kevin Duckworth probably will miss the rest of the playoffs, but Buck Williams 
should be able to play in Saturday's series opener against San Antonio, 
Portland Trail Blazer team physician Robert Cook said Wednesday in Hillsboro, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The two biggest players in the Trail Blazers' starting lineup were injured in 
Thursday night's 106-92 victory at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave Portland a 3-0 sweep of the Mavericks in the first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
Duckworth, the starting center, broke his right hand in a third-quarter 
collision with James Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
"He possibly could have some limited function in two to three weeks, but that's 
questionable," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Duckworth's absence means 12-year NBA veteran Wayne Cooper, second-year pro 
Mark Bryant and rookie Cliff Robinson probably will take turns guarding San 
Antonio center David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was injured when he was struck in the right eye by Donaldson's elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Trail Blazer rookie Cliff Robinson issued a statement 
apologizing for his involvement in a melee that resulted in his arrest outside 
a Portland bar. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to apologize to my teammates, coaches and fans for the incident in 
which I was involved last Saturday night," he said in a statement released by

<P>
National League umpire Bob Engel, suspended after he was accused of stealing 
baseball cards, faces a new charge of trying to take cards from a second store. 
</P>
<P>
Engel pleaded innocent Tuesday to misdemeanor counts of shoplifting seven boxes 
of Score baseball cards from a Target store on April 21 and attempting to steal 
50 packs of cards from Costco in January. 
</P>
<P>
Engel, an umpire since 1966, was placed on indefinite suspension by the 
National League on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
Engel was not in court when his attorney entered innocent pleas to two counts 
of petty theft and one of commercial burglary. A pretrial hearing was scheduled 
for May 25. 
</P>
<P>
Costco officials contacted the Kern County District Attorney's office after 
hearing of Target's charge.

<P>
Lisa Leslie, Morningside High's All-American center, has scored over 700 on her 
third attempt at the Scholastic Aptitude Test, making her eligible to play 
collegiate basketball as a freshman next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 Leslie said she will take her final recruiting trip this weekend 
to Cal State Long Beach. She is also considering USC and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie averaged 27 points, 15 rebounds and seven blocked shots a game last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie scored 101 points in a half against South Torrance this year. She was 
denied a chance at the national record of 105, set by Cheryl Miller of 
Riverside Poly in 1982, when South Torrance refused to play the second half.

CLOTHING: GIGI, AND GIGI ALONE, CREATES HIS ONE-OF-A-KIND DESIGNS FOR SOME OF 
THE COUNTY'S BEST-KNOWN SOCIETY WOMEN.

<P>
Money. That's exactly what it takes to have a perfectly fitted evening gown, 
and Gildas Conan, a custom dressmaker in Orange County, makes no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
He walks to the front door of his shop not far from Fashion Island in Newport 
Beach wearing blue jeans and a short-sleeved shirt. He has a ponytail and 
perfectly manicured eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
As he unlocks the door, the visitor is not sure whether he's the hired help or 
the designer who works with Orange County's best-known society women. 
</P>
<P>
Conan, who prefers to be called Gigi, greets his visitor in his native French 
accent and desperately scurries to find a chair. 
</P>
<P>
In the front entrance, there's a small table with women's accessories: colorful 
necklaces, bracelets and rings with brilliant stones. 
</P>
<P>
Gigi is one of a slowly vanishing breed of fashion designers known as 
couturiers. The couture business traces its origins to a 19th-Century 
Englishman named Charles F. Worth, who crystallized the fashion of the era and 
founded the French custom dressmaking industry. Worth was the first to tell his 
customers what they could and could not wear and the first to develop a rapid 
succession of new ideas and designs. Until the time of Worth, dressmakers had 
little influence on design. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 19th Century, other couturiers with names such as Paquin, 
Doucet, Callot Soeurs and Redfern established their reputations. Custom 
dressmakers traveled regularly between New York and Paris, bringing back French 
ideas and French fabric for their well-heeled clientele. Every bride who could 
afford it had her trousseau made by Worth, and many wealthy women ordered gowns 
from his house by mail. 
</P>
<P>
As time went by, however, couturiers slowly faded from the fashion scene. Women 
became more involved with juggling careers, family and outside activities, Gigi 
said, and had less time to spend on fittings and waiting weeks or months for a 
handmade gown. 
</P>
<P>
Gigi scoffed at the many department stores and fashion designers who like to 
refer to themselves as couturiers, complaining that they make a mockery of the 
true meaning of the French term. 
</P>
<P>
"Retail is not couture," he sniffed. "They are simply making alterations. 
You'll never see them make or design one special dress for a lady." 
</P>
<P>
"I am not retail at all," Gigi said. "There is nothing for duplication or for 
sale here. Everything comes from the looms and beadwork." 
</P>
<P>
Gigi says his evening gowns are 95% handmade, contrasted with 75% handwork for 
most couturiers. And, not surprisingly, customers pay dearly for the luxury of 
a custom-made gown. Gigi's gowns start at $4,000 and can range up to $26,000. 
Bridal gowns start at $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gigi differentiates himself from Amen Wardy, proprietor of an exclusive women's 
wear shop in Newport Center's Fashion Island. He points out that each of his 
gowns are one-of-a-kind designs, whereas Wardy sells clothing by other top 
fashion designers as well as his own. 
</P>
<P>
Gigi, 39, moved from Paris in 1981 and settled in Las Vegas, where he worked as 
a musical theater dancer for two years. Realizing that he couldn't earn a 
living as a dancer forever, he decided to study fashion design. 
</P>
<P>
He says his best training came from doing the beading on costumes for members 
of the Paris Opera. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Orange County in 1984 and has about 25 regular clients, the most 
well-known of whom is probably Debbie Reynolds. Most of his customers are from 
the Newport Beach area, but he has others in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New 
York. But don't expect to walk in to Gigi's shop: Customers are seen by 
appointment only. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach designer says that Orange County society women are quite 
different from their counterparts in Paris, where he worked as subcontractor 
for Chanel and Christian Dior. 
</P>
<P>
"They need a bit of education here in Orange County on fashion. They're very 
casual. Not my clients, of course, but the rest of them," Gigi said. "I think 
it's California and the laid-back atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County lady will not sacrifice comfort for looks. My personal 
clients, of course, love looks. If they can deal without a train, however, they 
will," he said. "In Paris, a woman is willing to be bothered with a train all 
night just for the sake of the look walking down the staircase at the opera." 
</P>
<P>
But his business hasn't always been glamorous and prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
When Gigi first opened his shop, he says, "I was wondering how I would pay the 
rent. I never advertised in any of the papers or put pictures of my dresses 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
His big break came four years ago when Kathryn Thompson, a prominent Orange 
County developer, asked him to make a dress for her. Gigi said: "It was like, 
'Ta da! He must not be all that bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gigi, Thompson says, "is very meticulous with his beading work." 
</P>
<P>
Nora Hester, a Corona del Mar resident known for her charity work with 
Childrens Hospital of Orange County in Orange, heard about Gigi from a neighbor 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing you can find on the rack," Hester said. "You get the fabric, 
color and style you want. He really delivers, and the amazing thing is that he 
does all the intricate beading work himself." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview in his shop, Gigi pointed to a wall where photos were 
hung of women wearing the dresses he had made for them. Dramatic evening gowns 
of thick, gorgeous silk. Ostrich feathers jutting from the shoulders. Brilliant 
colors and detailed beadwork. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the photos are small boxes filled with beads, lace, thread, sequins, 
feathers, bits of fur and anything else that can add a frill or sparkle to a 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
"I am experimental with every client," Gigi said. The last ball he designed 
gowns for was for a fund-raiser organized by a chapter of the Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa last year. The theme for the benefit was "Heat wave." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go Carmen Miranda, but I visualized sun, sky, seas, sand, 
tropical. So I created a dress, for the chairwoman, with strange colors: 
burgundy, tangerine, copper, purple, black with touches of khaki. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds terrible but looked wonderful. She had a bird of paradise on the 
shoulder with the body and long feathers trailing on the floor and a matching 
purse and jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
Gigi's trademark, if you like, is the matching purse. He'll purchase a plain 
purse, then decorate it with beads and sequins to match the same pattern as the 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
One of his more memorable creations was a gown he likes to call the "Rain 
Forest" dress. The gown had a cascade of leaves draping down into three layers 
of silk in three shades of green. On one shoulder was a cascade of beaded 
orchids. 
</P>
<P>
"But when these dresses are worn for another party," Gigi said, "it will just 
be another elegant dress. There won't be a tag on it reading, 'I am Rain 
Forest.' Someone might recognize it, but that's another story." 
</P>
<P>
He has been asked to move his shop into Fashion Island, "but what for?" Gigi 
asks. "I don't have time to even answer the phone." 
</P>

200th Store While O! Deli trys to get a toehold in Orange County, El Pollo Loco 
is about to open its 200th store. The "store of significance," as the company 
calls it, is situated on Yorba Linda Boulevard in Yorba Linda and opens 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new store is in keeping with a corporate plan laid out five years ago that 
called for 200 stores by 1990. "With the opening of the Yorba Linda El Pollo 
Loco, we will have achieved a benchmark in our development plan," said James 
Verney, president of El Pollo Loco. 
</P>
<P>
The chain, which is owned by Denny's Inc. of Irvine, operates exclusively in 
sun-belt states where it can capitalize on its Spanish name, Mexican heritage 
and California's health-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
One recent study, however, questioned whether El Pollo Loco's grilled, 
marinated chicken is much lower in fat and calories than fried chicken. The 
Center for Science in the Public Interest, which conducted the study using data 
supplied by fast-food firms, found it was 9.5% lower in calories and 2% lower 
in fat than the fried chicken sold at the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain. 
</P>
<P>
El Pollo could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Still, El Pollo Loco remains the nation's fastest-growing chain of chicken 
restaurants.

Eager to expand into Northern California, PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. said 
Wednesday that it is considering making a buyout offer for HEALS Health Plan, 
an Oakland-based health maintenance organization that has been courting suitors 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress-based PacifiCare, which has built its HMO network through internal 
growth, has made it clear that it now wants to expand through acquisitions. The 
company recently was rebuffed in an attempt to buy bankrupt Maxicare Health 
Plans of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare's chief financial officer, said the company wants to 
expand into Northern California, where it has no contracts, to provide better 
service to large corporate customers that have employees statewide. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of employers in the state with locations in Northern 
California as well as Southern California and we would like to accommodate that 
market demand," Lowell said. 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare's health and acquisition muscle was demonstrated by its 
second-quarter financial results, which were reported Wednesday. The company is 
flush with cash for a buyout. It reported that on March 31 it had $190 million 
available in cash and short-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
The company posted second-quarter earnings of $3.9 million, up 88% over $2.1 
million for the same quarter a year ago. Its second-quarter revenues increased 
59% to $246.76 million over revenue of $154.97 for the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Investors apparently were pleased with the results. The price of the company's 
stock rose to $18 a share, up $1.25, at the close of the market Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
HEALS has been looking for a buyer that could provide it with much-needed 
working capital. Even in more need of cash is HEALS IPA (Independent Practice 
Assn.), a network of physicians that provides care to HEALS members and is 
heavily in debt. While the IPA operates as a separate organization, it owns 40% 
of the HEALS HMO that is for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell said PacifiCare, which has 636,500 members, so far has not made "a solid 
offer" for HEALS, which has 96,000 members in the San Francisco Bay Area. But 
he added, "We are very interested. We have had quite a few visits with them." 
</P>
<P>
He said that as an alternative to acquiring HEALS, PacifiCare also is talking 
with doctors in the Bay Area to determine if it would be feasible to start up 
its own Northern California operation. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser Permanente is by far the largest player in the Northern California 
market, with more than 2 million members constituting about 50% of the managed 
care market.

Advanced Logic Research Inc., the Irvine personal computer maker, said 
Wednesday that it has signed its first deal with a major retail chain, while at 
the same time reporting a 7% increase in earnings for its latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
ALR computers will now be sold in the 440 stores owned by Intelligent 
Electronics, an Exton, Pa.-based retail chain that owns Todays Computers 
Business Centers and Entre Computer Centers. The Pennsylvania firm could add 
400 outlets if its pending acquisition of the Connecting Point of America chain 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"This deal opens doors for ALR's name exposure and a new channel of 
distribution," said Dave Kirkey, ALR's vice president of marketing. "It will 
bring a new level of credibility for us in the computer industry. We're not 
just another clone, not just another box." 
</P>
<P>
Under the two-year agreement, Intelligent Electronics will be the exclusive 
national franchise retailer for ALR's line of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, ALR computers have been sold primarily through a group of about 
1,000 resellers and through individual agreements with computer stores. Kirkey 
said the deal with Intelligent Electronics could help sales in the reseller 
channel by boosting the company's name recognition. Intelligent Electronics 
reported revenue of $700 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, ALR reported its quarterly results for the first time since 
going public on April 11. For the second quarter ended March 31, the company 
reported net income of $3.2 million, up 7% compared to $3 million for the 
year-ago period. Sales were a record $44.8 million, up 207% from $14.6 million 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended March 31, the company reported net income of $6.2 
million on revenue of $84.3 million, contrasted with net income of $1.5 million 
on revenue of $27.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkey attributed the improved second-quarter results to growing acceptance of 
the company's top-of-the-line computers. 
</P>
<P>
He said the figures do not reflect sales resulting from another agreement 
announced two weeks ago in which a national distributor, Softsel/Microamerica, 
agreed to sell ALR's line of computers. 
</P>
<P>
The company's underwriters for its stock offering, PaineWebber and 
Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, announced Wednesday that they would exercise 
their option to issue 450,000 additional shares of common stock. 
</P>
<P>
After the offering, about 36.9% of ALR's stock will be in the public's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The offering will yield about $5.4 million in proceeds for ALR, bringing its 
total proceeds from going public to $36.8 million.

Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene arrived at the White House for a 
meeting with President Bush today and urged the world's nations to legally 
guarantee the republic's declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene said the coming summit between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev could be a crucial turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"Fate is giving them the chance to make an admirable mark on history," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At a photo session just before beginning her meeting with Bush, Prunskiene was 
asked about the President's statement that the United States has no mediation 
role in the Lithuanian matter. 
</P>
<P>
She refused to reply, saying she had agreed not to answer questions before her 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene said earlier that the independence crisis in Lithuania can be 
resolved if strong international pressure is brought on Gorbachev to permit 
genuine democracy in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the world's darling does not have the monopolistic right to decide the 
fate of other nations," she said, referring to Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Greeted with a standing ovation as she opened public testimony earlier today on 
Capitol Hill, the 47-year-old prime minister acknowledged that Gorbachev would 
prefer that Lithuania remain within the Soviet federation, "although not by 
force." 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the United States and the world don't have to choose between 
the Soviet leader and the break-away republic. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution is this: Gorbachev and a breakthrough for democracy in the Soviet 
Union and an independent Lithuania," she said. "These two are compatible and 
converging sides of the same process, rather than alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for the West to perceive that pressuring Mr. Gorbachev helps 
rather than hinders." 
</P>
<P>
International pressure, Prunskiene said, can help Gorbachev become "a 
consistent practitioner of democracy" and overcome reactionary forces inside 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene delivered her testimony before the Commission on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, the so-called Helsinki Commission formed in 1975 to 
monitor Soviet compliance with its human rights commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, at a White House news conference hours before the prime minister's visit, 
was asked if the United States could mediate the Lithuania dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a constructive role for the United States, of course, we should 
fulfill that, but there's not," Bush replied. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting over breakfast with members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Prunskiene said Lithuania "is prepared for compromises" in those negotiations 
but "cannot and will not revoke our declaration of independence."

ACTOR DAVID RAPPAPORT FOUND DEAD FROM APPARENT SUICIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
Actor David Rappaport was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot 
wound just two months after an earlier suicide attempt, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport, 38, who appeared in a Thanksgiving episode of "L.A. Law," was found 
by a motorist in Laurel Canyon Park about 200 yards off Mulholland Drive about 
6:45 p.m. Wednesday, Cmdr. 
</P>
<P>
William Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was dead of a gunshot wound we believe was self-inflicted," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office was to conduct an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-foot, 11-inch Rappaport was reported missing at 10 p.m. Tuesday by his 
manager, Frankie Leigh, who said the actor had been depressed recently. 
Authorities said that on March 4, paramedics found him unconscious and not 
breathing inside a car near his Hollywood home. A hose in the car was connected 
to the car's exhaust pipe. 
</P>
<P>
The British-born actor was best known for his role in the motion pictures "Time 
Bandits" and "The Bride." He also starred in the short-lived television 
program, "The Wizard."

BUSH 'CAN'T REJOICE' WHILE 6 OTHERS ARE HELD HOSTAGE

President Bush said today that while he welcomes the recent release of two 
Americans hostages in Lebanon, he "can't rejoice . . . as long as six others 
are held hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the release of Frank Reed and Robert Polhill might foretell the 
release of all Americans, Bush said, "I can't say that our actions facilitated 
the release of Reed and Polhill. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the affirmation and reaffirmation of our policy contributed, but 
there were no behind-the-scenes actions that pulled this off." 
</P>
<P>
The President said at a morning news conference that he welcomed the release of 
Reed and Polhill, "but I can't rejoice and say my heart is full of hope and 
goodwill as long as six others are held hostages." 
</P>
<P>
The six include Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the 
Associated Press, who was kidnaped in March, 1985, and is the longest-held 
Western hostage in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would be willing to make goodwill gestures to Iran "that wouldn't 
be perceived as negotiating for the release of hostages." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what those gestures might be, the President mentioned that Iran is eager 
to learn about four Iranian diplomats kidnaped in Lebanon in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could go back and get any information that would relieve the anxiety of 
the loved ones of those people, we ought to do that," Bush said. "I can 
understand the Iranians wanting the full accounting. Here they've said, 'Here 
is an area where we can get information.' " 
</P>
<P>
He added that the United States does not think the four diplomats are alive.

BRITISH VOTE EXPECTED TO DRUB THATCHER

<P>
Britons voting in nationwide elections today were expected to hand Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher the worst electoral drubbing of her 11 years in 
power and register strong opposition to her economic policies, including a poll 
tax that has set off rioting. 
</P>
<P>
Officials reported a brisk turnout during the daylong balloting in brilliant 
sunshine across most of the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, votes are counted by hand and most results were to be declared in 
the early hours Friday, several hours after the polls close. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot for 201 local councils was the Conservative Party prime minister's 
biggest electoral test since her popularity began dropping a year ago to a now 
record low due in part to higher interest rates and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition socialist Labor Party held a huge lead of more than 20 points, 
recent opinion polls indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Today's polling is the first time the Conservatives have faced voters since the 
imposition April 1 of the so-called poll tax, an unpopular per-capita 
assessment by local governments that replaced a property-based levy. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are about 5,000 seats on local councils ranging from big regional 
cities to English country districts. 
</P>
<P>
A rout would increase speculation that the party may try to dump Thatcher this 
autumn, the last realistic chance before the next general election in 1991 or 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
"In midterm, the government aims to hold what it has. This we shall do," 
Conservative Party Chairman Kenneth Baker said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But computer forecasts based on opinion polls showed the Conservatives on 
course to lose up to 350 seats -- about one-fourth of the seats they are 
defending. As the bad news piled up, Thatcher aides hinted this week that the 
poll tax may be amended. 
</P>
<P>
Critics call the tax inherently unfair because the country's richest man pays 
the same as his gardener. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old local tax system, only the country's 17 million homeowners paid a 
property tax. The new tax is levied against every adult.

The oldest known drifting iceberg, a structure once twice the size of the 
nation's capital, is breaking up in the South Atlantic, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
First spotted by satellite in January, 1978, when it was about twice the size 
of Washington, D.C., the iceberg was measured in 1983 by a Coast Guard 
icebreaker, which found that it still had one side exceeding 20 miles in 
length. 
</P>
<P>
"And that was only the tip of the iceberg," said Navy Capt. Tom Callaham, 
director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ice Center. 
"For four years it was grounded in more than 200 feet of water." 
</P>
<P>
The iceberg drifted free in 1982 and moved west around Antarctica, driven by a 
current that circulated counterclockwise along the continent's coast, Callaham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After a 5,700-mile odyssey that took it almost entirely around the Antarctic 
continent, the iceberg was last sighted in early February southwest of the 
Falkland Islands, off the Argentine coast, he said.

The Food and Drug Administration today approved the use of the drug AZT to 
treat children with AIDS. It is the only drug that has been shown to extend the 
lives of adults with the deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
New labeling on the drug outlines dosage recommendations for patients aged 3 
months to 12 years who have the disease or show symptoms of advanced infection 
with the virus that causes it. 
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said the new labeling 
"means the drug is now officially considered to be a standard therapy for 
children with AIDS." He said the new status should encourage insurance 
companies to reimburse patients for pediatric use of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has been under pressure to approve AZT for treatment of children, 
particularly from parents of stricken children who have no other recourse. An 
advisory committee of outside experts voted 7 to 1 on March 30 to recommend the 
new pediatric labeling.

By this fall, Qantas plans to stop flying to Amsterdam, Athens, Bombay and

Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream today said ta-ta to Zsa Zsa Gabor, disclosing that it 
has discontinued airing a commercial featuring the actress who slapped the 
Beverly Hills cop. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which bills Gabor as an "Unbelievable Spokesperson for an Unbelievable 
Product," was one of a series of new commercials for the company's Dreyer's 
Grand Light product. 
</P>
<P>
"The ad campaign features spokespersons known for their 'unbelievable' 
experiences or reputations promoting our 'unbelievably' good product,' " said 
Steven Schickler, vice president of marketing for Dreyer's. 
</P>
<P>
Schickler said that although Gabor's spot was meant to be humorous, Dreyer had 
received more than 300 complaints since announcing that the actress would film 
a commercial for the company. The ad began airing in Dreyer's major markets 
three weeks ago.

Retail sales generally rebounded in April as consumers returned to stores to 
shop for Easter and spring items, several of the nation's biggest retailers 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Many retailers who had a dismal March posted better results last month. 
</P>
<P>
Woolworth Corp., whose sales plummeted in March compared to a year earlier, had 
a 21.1% sales gain in April. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers again spent most of their money on apparel and lower-priced items 
while generally shying away from more expensive purchases. Consumers remained 
burdened by high installment debt and were again cautious about major

'HIGH' ON TAYLOR FOR S&amp;L JOB, BUSH SAYS

President Bush said today that he is "very high on" Federal Reserve regulator 
William Taylor to replace L. William Seidman as boss of the Administration's 
savings and loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman told Bush today that he "enthusiastically supports" Taylor, director of 
bank supervision at the Federal Reserve Board, the President said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"He suggested the name of Bill Taylor, who we're very high on, to take his 
responsibilities," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is on leave from his Federal Reserve job and is serving temporarily as 
the chief staff officer of an Administration-led panel that oversees the work 
of Seidman's bailout agency, the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that Bush would not resist 
a move by Seidman, 69, to leave before the October, 1991, expiration of his 
term as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush today denied reports that he suggested that Seidman leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey listen, I haven't told you I'm anxious to see Bill Seidman leave. . . . 
He's done a good job," Bush said. "It's his initiative with me. . . . I think 
Seidman has conducted himself with extraordinary grace and great ability." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was approached by the Administration earlier this year for the job of 
director of the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, which 
regulates solvent S&amp;Ls. He turned that offer down. 
</P>
<P>
The job of FDIC and RTC chairman may prove more attractive. Once appointed, the 
chairman serves independently and cannot be removed by the President. Also, the 
job is not subject to government salary restrictions.

China on Thursday called on the Asian Development Bank to renew loans suspended 
since last June's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Li Guixian, governor of the People's Bank of China, told the annual ADB meeting 
here that the bank was wrong to suspend loans on the basis of the domestic 
political affairs of its members. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to repair relations with the bank soon. 
</P>
<P>
The ADB, under the prompting of its major Western shareholders, cut off new 
loans to China after the crackdown in Tian An Men Square. It now makes only 
humanitarian loans to China and supplies funds approved before June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates said the ADB board of governors, representing 49 member governments, 
is unlikely to make any fresh loans to China soon. 
</P>
<P>
One delegate said any decision to renew lending to China will probably not come 
before a Group of Seven meeting of industrialized nations in Houston in July.

A GLITZY PREMIERE FOR TROUBLED COMPANY

<TEXT>
<P>
On the surface, it looked like another op'nin', another show for the Joffrey 
Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the typical triple bill began 
with some old neoclassical kitsch and ended with a spangly new ode to the faded 
glories of vaudeville. Both instant crowd-pleasers were choreographed by the 
official keeper of the Joffrey flame, Gerald Arpino. 
</P>
<P>
Few in the dressy, unruly, non-capacity audience for this non-gala gala may 
have known it, but the show went on while the company confronted chronic, 
possibly fatal, turmoil behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Financial crises clouded the horizon. The trustees and administrators were 
engaged in savage internal warfare. Loyalties were polarized. 
</P>
<P>
Resignations and defections had begun to pile up. Accusations and 
counter-accusations echoed from coast to coast. Arpino's continuing role as 
artistic director languished in doubt. So, for that matter, did the immediate 
survival of the Arpino-Joffrey oeuvre as we have long known and sometimes loved 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the inaugural festivities at the Music Center accentuated the 
negative in matters of repertory. Arpino's "Italian Suite," first seen in 1983, 
is little more than a collection of amiable cliches. The frantic cheer is 
filtered through cloying rosy lights and propelled by speedy steps and athletic 
contortions that contradict the impulses of Wolf-Ferrari gurgling in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
At least "Italian Suite" isn't pretentious. That cannot be said of "The 
Pantages and the Palace Present 'TWO-A-DAY.' " 
</P>
<P>
Arpino's latest show-biz extravaganza is a splashy, glitzy, costly, witless 
production number. Also a massive bore. 
</P>
<P>
It looks nice, in its defiantly tasteless and nostalgic way. It lacks focus, 
however. It lacks purpose. It lacks balletic interest. It lacks point, not to 
mention a point of view. 
</P>
<P>
It pretends to revere the traditions of the all-American variety show, as 
sandwiched between sagas of the Silver Screen. The idea isn't original, but 
there may be some life in it yet. 
</P>
<P>
For at least one ungrateful viewer, the greatest satisfactions of the evening 
involved the ancient lightweight charms of Arthur Saint-Leon's "La Vivandiere." 
In the pas de six, the exquisite Tina LeBlanc and the mercurial Edward Stierle 
were fleetly seconded by Cameron Baden, Jodie Gates, Cynthia Giannini and Kim 
Sagani. 
</P>
<P>
Here one could savor ballet without padding, without puffery, without false 
sentiment and without gimmickry. It was reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
Full review runs in Friday's Calendar section.

MADE A DIFFERENCE, NIXON SAYS OF HIS PRESIDENCY

Former President Richard Nixon said today that the fact that he resigned will 
always be a part of his presidency but that down the road the people, rather 
than the historians, will remember that he made a difference in the quest for 
world peace. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with host Bryant Gumbel on NBC's "Today," Nixon, who resigned 
in 1974 rather than face impeachment on charges related to the Watergate 
scandal, was asked what historians will write about his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what historians will write and what history in the broader sense may 
conclude could be very different," Nixon responded. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said he will be remembered for making a difference "as far as our 
relations with China are concerned and in initiating a new relationship with 
the Soviet Union, in saving Israel with an airlift in 1973, in ending the 
Vietnam War, ending the draft. I think those events will be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "Of course, I'm doing a little wishful thinking here, I know, 
and I would not suggest that historians, the current crop, would ever reach 
that conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
As for his own resurgence in the public light, Nixon was asked to reflect on 
his own words when he said public sympathy comes to even the most controversial 
with the onset of old age. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it depends on what the public is," said the 77-year-old Nixon. "Some of 
the public say, 'My God, is the man ever going to die?' And all they're 
interested in is reading my obituary. And then there are others who are amazed 
I'm still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, what I hope is that my life, in addition to being 
examples that you can make a difference if you set your mind to it in public 
leadership, what I hope is that people will remember that I lived by the rule: 
Never give up. Never look back. Always look forward. And if that is the lesson 
that young people can get from my life, it will have all been worthwhile. Never 
give up."

BRONX WINS WARNERS DISCLAIMER ON FICTION IN 'VANITIES BONFIRE'

After much public pressure from Bronx officials, Warner Bros. confirmed today 
that an agreement has been reached to run a standard two-sentence disclaimer at 
the end of "The Bonfire of the Vanities," assuring moviegoers the story is 
fictional. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of thing you see in most movies and a lot of books," said a 
Warner spokeswoman of the disclaimer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not anything special." 
</P>
<P>
The movie, which filmed several scenes in the Bronx and Manhattan last month, 
infuriated Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer for what he called its 
negative depiction of the area. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, a Wall Street executive watches his life fall apart after a 
hit-and-run accident in the South Bronx. Much of the book is set in the Bronx 
County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrer accused the movie studio of "Bronx-bashing" and asked for a disclaimer 
detailing the borough's cultural institutions and defending its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The full disclaimer, however, simply reads: 
</P>
<P>
"This motion picture is a work of fiction, and is not intended to reflect 
actual events or conditions in the localities portrayed. Warner Bros. wishes to 
thank the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting and the people of 
the City of New York for their cooperation during the filming."

The television show "America's Most Wanted" will broadcast a re-enactment of 
the theft of artworks from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, as part of the 
effort to solve the $200-million crime. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of the FBI, museum officials allowed camera crews this week to 
recreate the March 18 crime, using actors to play the thieves and museum guards 
and enlarged photographs of the artwork made from museum slides. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly series on the FOX network re-creates unsolved crimes and provides 
telephone numbers for viewers to call in with tips. 
</P>
<P>
John Kavanaugh, the segment's producer, said the FBI, police and museum 
officials worked together to piece together details of the crime in which two 
men posed as police officers, bound two museum guards and made off with 13 
works thought to be worth more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Composite drawings of both thieves will be shown during the program, 
tentatively scheduled for broadcast May 13.

Ted Danson says "Cheers" could survive his departure.

10th.

"Three Men and a Baby." He also appeared in the 1989 movies "Cousins" and 
"Dad." 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether I want to hang around and do a 10th season," he said

doing 'Cheers' and then run around three more months doing movies."

LIZ SMITH: 'DREAMGIRLS' FOR FRANK OZ, VOICE OF MISS PIGGY

RECENTLY, I said David Geffen, the Wunderkind of Hollywood, is ready to bring 
Broadway's hit "Dreamgirls" to the screen. It was noted then that Spike Lee had 
been rumored as a possible director. But here is who will actually direct 
"Dreamgirls" -- none other than Frank Oz, the voice of Miss Piggy on "The 
Muppets." Oz will also take a crack at writing the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility that Michael Peters, who shared the 1982 Tony Award 
with the late Michael Bennett for the musical's stage choreography, may do the 
dances for the film. 
</P>
<P>
ANN-MARGRET is wowing Chicago now with her dazzling song-and-dance act. But she 
meets this weekend with producer Linda Yellen to talk about starring in 
"Hiroshima Maidens." This is a true story, based on the book by Rodney Barker. 
It tells how a Connecticut matron took in three of the "maidens," victims of 
the U.S. atomic attack on Japan which ended World War II. The story tells of 
the effect this gesture had on the woman, her community and the scarred young 
women. 
</P>
<P>
If the beautiful Swede says yes, then Yellen will produce this remarkable tale 
for Aaron Spelling Productions. And John Erman, who guided Ann-Margret through 
recent TV hits -- "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" -- 
will probably direct. 
</P>
<P>
A BIG drum roll, hot rockets and a swirl of fanfare for Peter Martins. His new 
ballet, "Fearful Symmetries," made its New York City Ballet debut at Lincoln 
Center this week and is an utter triumph! 
</P>
<P>
What a relief -- this great cultural institution, founded by Georges Balanchine 
and Lincoln Kirstein, and carried on brilliantly by Jerome Robbins, has -- in 
recent years -- been under siege. There have been attacks by the New Yorker and 
Vanity Fair magazines, and behind-the-scenes "civil wars." But thanks to Peter 
Martins and the unflagging support of many important and dedicated benefactors, 
the City Ballet has regained its beautiful "legs." 
</P>
<P>
"Fearful Symmetries" is just super, one of the best experiences I've enjoyed at 
ballet in years. It is set to fabulous music by California's John Adams and is 
being danced by a wonderful group -- Heather Watts, Merrill Ashley, Alexandre 
Proia, Jock Soto, Margaret Tracey, Jeffrey Edwards and the corps de ballet. The 
scarlet, mauve and burnt-orange costumes by Steven Rubin are dramatic 
eye-catchers. 
</P>
<P>
I NOTE that the production was made possible by a generous gift from Carolyne 
and Henry Kravis. Well, dance mavens are in their debt. It was hard to believe 
during this exciting benefit evening in the New York State Theater that the 
night's two blond chairwomen-dynamos, Anne Bass and Ivana Trump, were "women 
scorned." They both looked so glamorous, jolly and carefree that even though 
they've been dragged through the tabloids by the defections of their respective 
husbands, they appear to be "anything but." 
</P>
<P>
ALMOST EVERY great name in theater will hit the Plaza in New York today at noon 
for the Drama League's 56th Annual Distinguished Performance Awards luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
I'll be there presenting to the fabled Texas tornado Tommy Tune.

RAIDERS TO BOOST PASSING GAME WITH HOLLAND FROM CHARGERS

<P>
The San Diego Chargers have reached an agreement to trade wide receiver Jamie 
Holland to the Raiders for a seventh-round draft pick, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were to announce the trade after receiving contract papers from Los 
Angeles and Holland's agent, Steve Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
"He's happy to be in L.A., and I think he'll do extremely well," Feldman said 
Wednesday. "We worked out a one-year deal this weekend and the documents were 
signed (Wednesday)." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bobby Beathard said Wednesday that the Chargers and Raiders 
have "agreed on the terms of the trade," but said the deal was contingent upon 
the Raiders making contact with Holland. He declined to discuss the terms of 
the trade. 
</P>
<P>
However, The San Diego Union, citing anonymous sources, reported today that 
Holland will go to the Raiders for a seventh-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
Because Holland is a free agent, he technically must sign with the Chargers 
before moving to Los Angeles. Feldman said the Chargers will receive signed 
paper work today. 
</P>
<P>
"I sensed in the off-season that Jamie might not fit in their plans and the 
chance to go to L.A. is a great opportunity," said Feldman. "They're looking to 
return to kickoff-return form from 1988, and want to use him a lot in their 
three-and four-wide-receiver set." 
</P>
<P>
Holland, 26, came to the Chargers from Ohio State. In three years in San Diego, 
he caught 71 passes for 1,010 yards and one touchdown, but failed to establish 
himself as a consistent performer. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Holland started opposite Anthony Miller when the Chargers went to 
a two-receiver set, but in 16 games he caught only 26 passes for 336 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Holland returned 79 kickoffs for the Chargers for an average of 21.9 yards. His 
94-yard return for a touchdown to close out the 1988 season against Kansas City 
stands as the third-longest in club history.

match Wednesday in which she dropped a set to Australian Rachel McQuillan. 
</P>
<P>
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, the No. 3 seed, cruised to a 6-2, 6-1 victory 
over 16th-seeded West German Sylvia Hanika; fifth-seed Helena Sukova downed 
fellow Czechoslovak Regina Rajchrtova 7-6, 6-2 and Judith Wiesner of Austria, 
the No. 8 seed, defeated West German Wiltrud Probst 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova was never in trouble against Cueto, who was slowed by an aching 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't able to move as well as she can and that took a bit of the wind out 
of her sails," Navratilova said. But I felt more comfortable today.

Texas basketball coach Tom Penders has been suspended for one Southwest 
Conference game for his comments about the quality of league officiating. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by SWC commissioner Fred Jacoby is subject to appeal, and Texas will 
exercise that option before the SWC Compliance Committee May 16 in Dallas, the 
Dallas Morning News reported. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension applies to the Longhorns' first SWC game next season, against 
Texas A&amp;M on Jan. 2 in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Penders and assistant coach Jamie Ciampaglio have been placed on 
probation for the entire season and any further criticism of SWC officials 
could result in future single- or multi-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
Penders criticized the officiating after Texas' loss to Houston in the 
semifinals of the SWC tournament March 10. Penders was reprimanded earlier by 
Jacoby for comments on the officiating in Texas' loss to Arkansas on Jan. 25 in 
Fayetteville.

CO-OWNER OF ROYALS MAY REBUY TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: DEVELOPER'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES SPARK A PROPOSAL TO SELL OFF HIS 
50% INTEREST IN THE CLUB.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kansas City Royals co-owner Ewing Kauffman said today he has received a 
proposal from the other co-owner that could result in Kauffman's reacquiring 
100% of the team this year. 
</P>
<P>
Avron Fogelman, a Memphis real estate developer, bought into the team in 1983 
when Kauffman, the team founder, was thought to have serious health problems. 
In the last two years, Fogelman's financial situation has markedly deteriorated 
and Kauffman admitted today that their personal relationship has also soured. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I feel different about him than I did," Kauffman said at a news 
conference at Royals Stadium. "But he is drowning and trying to stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman said under the proposal, which he is considering, the club would loan 
Fogelman $34 million and the loan would be secured by Fogelman's 50% interest. 
</P>
<P>
Fogelman would then give Kauffman an option to buy out Fogelman's interest for 
the outstanding balance of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated, the Royals said in a statement, that Kauffman's option would 
be exercised immediately after the closing of the loan, but the actual purchase 
would occur later. 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman said he doubted very much if there was any danger of the team leaving 
town. The Royals and Kansas City Chiefs recently signed long-term leases, and 
voters in April approved a new financing measure with Jackson County 
guaranteeing the teams certain financial help. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the Royals will be offered for sale to the highest bidder who is 
acceptable to Major League Baseball. An investment banking firm will be 
retained to conduct the sale. 
</P>
<P>
An acceptable bidder would have to repay the $34-million loan, as well as all 
amounts owed by the Royals to Kauffman, and assume all other liabilities, 
including the new stadium lease. 
</P>
<P>
If a bid is received by a third party, Kauffman would have the right to meet it 
but would not be obligated to. The closing of the sale would occur on Jan. 2, 
1991. If no third-party bid is received, Kauffman would purchase Fogelman's 
interest on Jan. 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I am anxious to provide assistance to Mr. Fogelman in a way that will ensure 
the continued successful presence of the Royals in Kansas City," said Kauffman, 
who sold the half-interest to Fogelman for $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Fogelman's proposal necessitated by his current financial difficulties, is 
very onerous to me personally. But I am giving full consideration to his 
wishes. I am working closely with Mr. Fogelman and expect a final resolution 
within the next few weeks."

NFL ASSAILS D.C. PLAN FOR SPORTS LOTTERY; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE LEAGUE IS CONSIDERING SUING THE CITY TO STOP THE GAME, WHICH HAS 
BEEN GIVEN TENTATIVE APPROVAL.

The NFL criticized a planned sports lottery today that would allow District of 
Columbia residents to bet on their pro teams and said it would consider suing 
the city to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"With increased betting on sports, the nature of fans would change and they 
would become more concerned about winning bets than seeing their team win a 
game," NFL spokesman Joe Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Lottery and Charitable Games Control Board tentatively approved the 
plan Wednesday. Before the lottery can start, however, it must be approved by 
city lawyers and passed again by the lottery board. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery would be the first in the nation allowing residents to bet on their 
local pro teams. The NFL Redskins, NBA Bullets, NHL Capitals and baseball's 
Baltimore Orioles would be in the district's lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon has a sports lottery, but the state has no NFL or major-league baseball 
team and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers aren't included in the game. Despite 
the exemption, the NBA is suing to halt the lottery because it opposes betting 
on league games. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL says such legalized gambling would make it easier to fix games, 
unlawfully makes money from their private enterprise and could turn fans 
against their home teams. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Browne said, Redskins fans may jeer the team if it tries to 
protect a three-point lead in a game where the Redskins are favored by four 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to create a situation where people are more concerned about how 
much a team wins by rather than if they win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Abe Pollin, owner of the Capitals and Bullets, called the proposed lottery a 
"horrible" idea and said he would work to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"It sends a terrible, terrible signal to people involved in sports," Pollin 
said. "We're trying to teach our young people to lead very straight lives and 
then this sort of thing comes along." 
</P>
<P>
Under the district's proposed game, points spreads would be used and prizes 
would range from $1 to $4,000, depending on the number of selections and 
correct picks.

OWNERS HAVE BEEN OPENLY NEGLIGENT IN SAFEGUARDING ASSETS

The Dodgers invested $7.9 million in the arm of Orel Hershiser. Then they told 
him that he could not properly prepare his arm for the season. They locked him 
out, along with all of his teammates, for three weeks of spring training. Their 
disregard for players' health made little sense then and seems more baffling 
now that Hershiser has blown out his shoulder, and many other pitchers, 
including Pascual Perez, John Dopson and Scott Bankhead, are hurting. 
</P>
<P>
Major league owners invest huge sums of money in their players and then put 
them at tremendous risk. The lockout may not have shortened the season but it 
may shorten several careers. Three weeks into the season, there are 63 players 
on the disabled list. Thirty-eight of them are pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," Ken Phelps of the Oakland Athletics said. "They thought we were 
all working out and staying in shape. But the players association told us not 
to work out. A guy like Hershiser was on his way to the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
The lockout probably hastened, but did not entirely cause, Hershiser's injury. 
Some of the blame should be directed at his manager and at Hershiser. Tommy 
Lasorda overused Hershiser at the end of the 1988 season. After Hershiser 
pitched into extra innings in his last start to obtain his record 59th straight 
scoreless inning, Lasorda used him six times in 17 days in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
He started him on a cold, wet day against the Mets and brought him back the 
next night in relief. Three days later, he left Hershiser in to pitch a 
complete game, even though the score was 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda let Hershiser throw two more complete games against Oakland -- both on 
three days of rest -- though the scores were 6-0 and 5-2. Observers were 
wondering then when Hershiser's arm would fall off. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank God I have an arm that can bounce back," Hershiser said then. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it didn't. The Dodgers mortgaged his future for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Lasorda said, "the guy never said there was anything wrong with him." 
Indeed, Hershiser didn't know what was best for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the player himself to let the manager and trainer know how he's 
feeling," former teammate Tim Leary said. "He wanted to pitch. I think he ended 
last year by pitching 11 innings because he had a shot at the ERA title. And he 
said he felt some pain in his shoulder after the season. He just pitched a lot 
of innings the last few years. Too many innings." 
</P>
<P>
You have to wonder about the quality of some teams' scouting. Last year, the 
Mets traded for Juan Samuel to be their center fielder, though it seemed 
obvious to anyone who watched him in Philadelphia that he could not play the 
position. Sure enough, the Mets soon learned he wasn't a center fielder and 
traded him six months later. 
</P>
<P>
Now the California Angels have obtained Luis Polonia to play left field. 
Haven't they seen him play out there? 
</P>
<P>
What's more odd about the deal is that the trade came the day after Manager 
Doug Rader said the Angels needed to improve their defense. He concluded that 
the team and Chili Davis were safer if Davis stayed out of left field and 
served as a DH. Now Davis and Polonia, two of the worst outfielders in 
baseball, are on the same team. Only one of them can DH. 
</P>
<P>
When Rader was asked if Polonia would play left field, he said, "All I've known 
about Luis Polonia is he can lead off in a very successful manner. We need to 
afford him the opportunity to show us what he can and cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
Weren't they watching him play over the past four seasons? The Yankees didn't 
dare let him play the outfield this year after catching his act last year. 
</P>
<P>
You have to wonder about Polonia's initiative, too. He was traded Sunday but 
didn't join the Angels until about noon Wednesday. The Angels were only 184 
miles away, in Baltimore. Tuesday afternoon, Polonia fraternized with his 
former teammates from the Yankees and Athletics at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Max Venable was left to handle the lead-off duties in those two 
days. He went 1 for 10, leaving the five players California has auditioned in 
the leadoff spot with a .195 batting average (17 for 87). 
</P>
<P>
Mets Manager Davey Johnson said several times last winter that he knew he would 
be in danger of being fired if his club got off to a poor start. The way the 
Mets are going, the Davey watch could begin this month. They are off to their 
worst start ever under Johnson and their worst since 1983, when they went 
through two managers (George Bamberger and Frank Howard) and lost 94 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets finished April in fourth place, 4 1/2 games out, with a 9-10 record. 
In the six previous Aprils under Johnson, the Mets finished in first or second 
place, no more than one game out and no worse than 11-9. Their cumulative April 
record under Johnson before this year was 75-42, a .641 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Mets' woeful start can't fully be blamed on Johnson. Their 
pitching is being wasted by an awful defense and not enough clutch hitting. But 
Mets management, which put together this hodgepodge of iron gloves, might find 
it easier to replace Johnson than to make the two or three necessary personnel 
moves needed to improve this team. 
</P>
<P>
But here's something else to consider, something that suggests criticisms of 
the Mets go beyond knee-jerk reactions to their first 20 games. The Mets have 
not been in first place since June 25, 1989. Since then, they have played 112 
games. They were barely above .500 in that time: 57-55. That's only three games 
better than what the Philadelphia Phillies (54-58) have done in that same 
period and worse than the Chicago Cubs (62-47), St. Louis Cardinals (60-52) and 
Pittsburgh Pirates (59-54). 
</P>
<P>
Ask yourself: Are the Mets only three games better than the Phillies and worse 
than the Pirates over 112 games? This team is either vastly overrated or 
champions of underachievement.

LONG-SHOTS' OPTIMISM AS HIGH AS ODDS

Although unbeaten Mister Frisky and once-beaten Summer Squall are formidable 
favorites for the Kentucky Derby, there are almost as many optimistic trainers 
on the Churchill Downs backstretch as there will be horses in the starting gate 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look out there, I don't see any superstars, no Seattle Slews and no 
Secretariats," said D. Wayne Lukas, who has an entry of Land Rush, Real Cash 
and Power Lunch in the Derby field. "The thing that jumps out at you is that 
there will be plenty of pace, and the favorites are going to be on or near that 
pace. A horse with position and the best trip will have the best chance to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
"The two favorites are legitimate, but a lot of horses have a good chance," 
said Ron McAnally, trainer of Arkansas Derby winner Silver Ending. "Mister 
Frisky won 13 of his races over questionable competition (in Puerto Rico) and 
the (speed-biased) track was in his favor at Santa Anita. Summer Squall has won 
every different way and on all kinds of tracks, but you must have strength to 
go a mile and a quarter under 126 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
"I know Summer Squall can run, but he's not going to set (a slow pace) on a dry 
track Saturday," said Carl Nafzger, who will saddle Florida Derby winner 
Unbridled. "Summer Squall will be pressing the pace, and that's a big 
difference. Mister Frisky? I think he has to prove himself." 
</P>
<P>
"They'll all hate me for saying this, but this is anybody's race and nobody 
knows who's going to win," said trainer John Parisella. "Laz (Barrera) worked 
(Mister Frisky) in 1:27 4-5, and that's not his M.O. And I don't think that 
Summer Squall is coming up to this race right. I know one thing. Anybody who's 
1-2-3-4 in the early running won't be around at the finish." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the co-favorites, Unbridled, Land Rush and Silver Ending figure to draw 
strong support while Country Day, Parisella's charge, is considered a long shot 
with a chance. These trainers do not believe they are running for second money. 
</P>
<P>
"With a good horse who is so giving, I'd normally like to give them a month 
between starts," McAnally said of Silver Ending, who will run with only 13 
days' rest. "But I ran him in Arkansas to get his confidence up and mine. He's 
very competitive and very gutty. There's a great deal of speed in this race. If 
he stays out of trouble and closes the way he did in Arkansas, he will make a 
very good showing Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've been the best-kept secret on the backstretch," Lukas said of the 
lack of media attention for his trio. "Our horses have thrived here this week, 
and Land Rush couldn't be doing better. The Blue Grass was great for the 
experience and conditioning we needed. We came out of our game plan to force 
the issue. Summer Squall (the Bluegrass winner) was wrapped up tight under Pat 
Day. The wet track didn't help, either. Land Rush is a bit gangly and not the 
nifty horse you need to win in the mud. But he likes this track just fine.
