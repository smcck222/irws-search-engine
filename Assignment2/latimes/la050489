CRITIC AT LARGE: THE FAMILY TIES OF PRODUCER JACK CUMMINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Cummings, who died a few days ago at the age of 84 and whose services were 
Monday, spent his professional career as a producer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
The titles of the films he produced ring bells in any filmgoer's or 
television-watcher's memory. They run backward in time from the Elvis Presley 
film "Viva Las Vegas" to "Born to Dance." 
</P>
<P>
Musicals were his strong suit, as they were MGM's, and Cummings produced, among 
others: "Bathing Beauty," "Three Little Words," "Lovely to Look At," "Kiss Me 
Kate," "Can Can," and the one he was always proudest of, "Seven Brides for 
Seven Brothers." 
</P>
<P>
But that was what might be called the front story. The back story was that 
Cummings was Louis B. Mayer's nephew, the son of Mayer's sister, and he was 
both rewarded by and rather cruelly punished by the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the sardonic jokes out of early Hollywood had to do with nepotism, the 
hiring of innumerable and presumably incompetent relatives. Universal's "Uncle" 
Carl Laemmle did more than anyone to establish the tradition, with the host of 
nephews and cousins he imported from Europe in the founding days of the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the relatives were incompetent, of course, and some were greatly 
creative. Among Laemmle's imports were the fine director-to-be William Wyler, a 
very distant cousin on his mother's side, and the powerful agent-to-be Paul 
Kohner, who was not a relative at all. Wyler was 20, Kohner 18 when Laemmle 
paid their passage to America. 
</P>
<P>
But in the industry at large the fact of kinship and nepotism could be like a 
bar sinister on the escutcheon, no matter how impressive the achievements came 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
Long into his retirement, Jack Cummings invited me to lunch one day at 
Hillcrest Country Club to talk about a career which, it was clear, he felt had 
been largely and unjustly invisible. 
</P>
<P>
His films, he said with a mixture of pride and bitterness, had grossed more for 
the studio than those of any other producer. But who knew, outside the walls of 
the studio itself? It was not that he was "Jack Cummings, Producer," it was 
that he was "Jack Cummings, L.B.'s Nephew, Who Produces." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, setting aside the bitterness, he knew he had been a damned good and 
creative producer, he said, with particular pride in all the innovations he had 
endorsed and encouraged in Stanley Donen's direction of "Seven Brides." He had 
also, Cummings said, encouraged the idea of Donen and Gene Kelly being 
co-directors on "Singin' in the Rain," which was a project of Arthur Freed, the 
best-known of MGM's musical producers. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings was well-rewarded, of course, but the coinage isn't always quite 
enough. It's been said of Hollywood that grossing well is the best revenge. 
Sometimes it's the only revenge. As it was, the great studio and its collective 
days of glory had predeceased Cummings by a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
At our lunch, Cummings told me a story that has haunted me ever since, for what 
it says about the industry's capricious and unexplainable ways and its capacity 
for unintended cruelties in those days of glory. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Cummings said, before shooting was to start on another musical, he and 
the director and the star had driven up the coast for a long and rollicking 
lunch before the hard work began. 
</P>
<P>
Driving back through Malibu in a convertible and singing in the sun, they 
realized they would be passing the home of another director, who had been 
imported from Europe at great cost to MGM but had received no assignments. He 
had married a beautiful woman and settled down to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's drop in and say hello," Cummings proposed, expansively. They did, and 
the director, hearing their boozy shouts, came outside. When he realized who 
his visitors were, the director yelled back to his wife in the house, with a 
catch in his voice: "I told you the studio hadn't forgotten."

'MASTERGATE' SEEKS A SUMMER HOME IN D.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington may yet be the summer home of "Mastergate." 
</P>
<P>
But not at the Kennedy Center, whose general manager of theaters, Drew Murphy, 
found himself swimming in a flood of stories this week after the disclosure he 
didn't think Larry Gelbart's Iran-Contra satire was for the Kennedy's Terrace 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of it was whether, when he said no to producer Eugene V. Wolsk and 
"Mastergate," he implied that the show's barbed political content might somehow 
jeopardize the Kennedy's future federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Good heavens, no!" exclaimed center spokeswoman Tiki Davies. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said producer Wolsk, who plans to bring the play to Broadway this fall. 
"He didn't really characterize it. He just said he didn't think it was for 
them. It was a very casual thing. The incident has really been overblown." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bit overblown, and I'm going to leave it overblown," author Gelbart 
cheerfully declared, aware that an uproar over a play usually helps to 
publicize it. Gelbart co-created the hit CBS version of the movie "M.A.S.H." 
and co-authored the hit film comedy, "Tootsie." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy himself was unavailable for an interview on the reasons for his 
rejection of "Mastergate." His action first was reported Tuesday by the 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Wolsk said American Rep officials will be talking to representatives of 
Washington's Arena Stage to see if they'd like to have the show this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"My interest is in having it on in Washington," producer Wolsk said, calling 
the Arena venue "just as good, or maybe better" than the Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Mastergate," one of three theater projects that Gelbart has been working on 
for several years, zings the Iran-Contra scandal, Oliver North, and TV coverage 
of hearings on the scandal (the ace correspondent here is Merry Chase of the 
Total News Network). It includes a plot to funnel $800 million to pro-American 
Central American guerrillas through a Vietnam movie epic, "Tet: The Movie." And 
it's not particularly reverent toward its genial, dense and fictional President 
of the United States, about whom the question is raised: "What does the 
President know, and does he have any idea that he knew it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Mastergate" was given its premiere early this year by the American Repertory 
Theater in Cambridge, Mass., drawing a rave from the New York Times' Frank 
Rich. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy spokeswoman Davies, speaking by phone from Washington, insisted 
Murphy's rejection had nothing to do with the play's content; he has neither 
read nor seen it. 
</P>
<P>
"We were rather nonplussed by the reaction," she said. "It was as though we had 
scorned the orphan at the door and sent her away." 
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that in 1985 the Kennedy staged Arthur Kopit's "The End of the 
World With Symposium to Follow," about nuclear war, generals and the way think 
tanks play games with the minds of citizens. The following year, it was home to 
Peter Sellars' adaptation of the Greek tragedy, "Ajax," this one set in the 
Pentagon and concerning Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"All we care about is artistic merit," she said, adding, "we're not even 
passing judgment on ("Mastergate"), because nobody's read a script yet."

PERFORMANCE SPACE TO OPEN WHERE HIGHWAYS MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, Orville, you think it'll never fly -- a nonprofit performance and dance 
center with a political bent? Then you underestimate Linda Frye Burnham and Tim 
Miller, the derring-doers who open the Highways performance and dance space in 
Santa Monica today. 
</P>
<P>
Only one other such venue (San Francisco's Life on the Water) has opened in the 
United States in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year-old performance artist Miller admits that he and Burnham are "two 
people who should know better." He was a founder of New York's alternative 
performance venue, PS 122; she founded High Performance magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"The conventional wisdom is that it's too late for a nonprofit alternative 
space to begin in the late years of Reaganism," Miller said. "New York has half 
a dozen spaces devoted solely to performance and dance." 
</P>
<P>
"And most of the other major cities (do too)," added Burnham, "but not L.A." 
</P>
<P>
That's changing. 
</P>
<P>
Housed in the 18th Street Arts Complex in Santa Monica, the airy, white 
3,000-square-foot Highways boasts a newly built sprung-plywood floor and seats 
up to 200. 
</P>
<P>
It will showcase an unprecedented number of artists on a programming schedule 
that, when up to steam, promises activity nearly every night. 
</P>
<P>
The first two months' schedule features a gala four-day benefit, 14 new 
full-length performance pieces, a Cinco de Mayo celebration, a gay and lesbian 
performance festival, an Irish mini-festival and performances by local homeless 
people and unemployed shipbuilders. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham and Miller say they are redressing nothing less than the 
near-annihilation of what was once a thriving presenting infrastructure in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"In (the late '70s) the performance community began to burgeon and it became 
L.A.'s contribution to the national arts scene. (But) over the past couple of 
years, during the real estate crunch, performance spaces had to start letting 
go," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost the Wallenboyd, the Lhasa Club in Hollywood, the Variety Arts 
Center, the Exploration series, the House, Lotto, L.A. Area Dance Alliance, 
L.A. Institute for Contemporary Art (LICA), and probably more," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"And that leaves only LACE (Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions) to serve what 
I believe is a large population of artists," Burnham added. 
</P>
<P>
"Works by local choreographers and performers were done all over the country on 
tour before they were done here," Miller said. "I had done 'Some Golden States' 
in five cities before I managed to find anywhere that I could do it in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that we all loved so much in the '70s where you just rented a 
storefront, opened the door and started having performances became literally 
impossible -- just from the bureaucratic red tape," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
Pipeline's Scott Kelman (of the defunct Wallenboyd Theaters) is familiar with 
red tape and with other forces that presenters must battle. 
</P>
<P>
"Producers of performance spaces provide a greater service for artists than the 
unions and shouldn't be perceived as entrepreneurs," he said, apropos of this 
past year's Equity Waiver theater battles. 
</P>
<P>
Like Kelman, Santa Monica Museum of Art director Tom Rhoads is enthusiastic 
about Highways but aware of the liabilities of being a presenter. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists have a particular way they want to realize things, but the city has 
very stringent ordinances," he said. "The institutions get caught between those 
two extremes and have to be responsible to both." 
</P>
<P>
LACE's Joy Silverman points out that the difficulties of presenting performance 
entail more than just basic space and funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Performers' needs are greater than that," she said. "They want -- and deserve 
-- equipment, fees and other things. It's more difficult than ever to raise 
money and get money for political and radical work. It's too difficult, too 
risky for corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the nature of the work (that scares sponsors), but also the conservative 
climate in this country." 
</P>
<P>
And that climate is precisely what has pushed Burnham and Miller to a more 
politicized vision since they first decided to open a space. 
</P>
<P>
"A year and a half ago it seemed just like we needed another space, but the 
idea's become more focused on intercultural challenge, and not just another 
formalist performance space," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We called it Highways because we're at the intersection of the Pacific Coast 
Highway and Interstate 10 and we're very interested in both of those axes," 
Burnham explained. "Until now the major direction energy has been flowing has 
been east-west. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles has looked to New York and to Europe for its artistic standards 
and we'd like to add the north-south axis because we're interested in what's 
going on in Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
"We're especially interested in new performance forms, in work that is formally 
challenging," Miller said, "but work that also relates to community, cultural 
communication and social issues." 
</P>
<P>
"We're fascinated with the mix that's happening in Los Angeles right now and 
we'd rather be here than any place in the world," Burnham said. "It's become a 
cultural intersection, and that's the place for us to find the answers to 
questions we have about the way the world is working."

OPERATOR INJURED WHEN HIS CRANE FALLS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 52-year-old man was listed in stable condition at UCI Medical Center after he 
leaped from a toppling crane Wednesday morning while working on a sewer 
reconstruction project. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was being withheld until relatives were notified, was 
working with an independent contractor on the city's project in the 1600 block 
of West Ball Road, according to Fire Chief Steve Magliocco. Officials said they 
were uncertain where the man lived and whether he was self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
Magliocco said the man was operating the crane off the back of a flatbed truck 
at 7:56 a.m. When he attempted to move a large pipe into a ditch, the crane 
tipped over. 
</P>
<P>
The operator jumped from the crane in the opposite direction and fell about 10 
feet to the ground. He suffered minor injuries to his knees and one of his 
arms, Magliocco said.

<P>
FUMIGATOR SENTENCED IN DEATH OF RESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louis E. Tilley of Los Alamitos, owner of Sunset Fumigation of Long Beach, has 
been sentenced to serve 60 days in jail or 40 days picking up freeway trash in 
a criminal case stemming from the death of a mentally disabled man. The man was 
overcome by the poison gas used to kill termites in his Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
The firm was also hit with $5,100 in fines and penalties on Tuesday by Los 
Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Richard Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
Tilley had pleaded no contest to a violation of the state Business and 
Professions Code, which specifies that it is a crime to fail to use effective 
secondary locks on a house being fumigated. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed in December after the death of Donald Akers, 34, a 
Vietnam War veteran with a service-related mental disability, according to 
Donald Kass, a Los Angeles County deputy city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset workers found Akers inside his home on Feb. 21, 1988, after they arrived 
to ventilate the house, which had been covered with a tent and fumigated. An 
autopsy showed that Akers had died of acute sulfuryl fluoride intoxication. At 
the time of the fumigation, according to Kass, Akers and his parents were to 
stay at a nearby hotel, but Akers had apparently returned to the house.

MOTHER GRANTED CUSTODY OF BOY BY SWEDISH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Swedish court Wednesday ordered that custody of a 3-year-old Tustin boy be 
returned to his mother, ending a saga that began about 7 weeks ago when the 
father fled to Sweden with the boy after staging a boating accident to fake 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Marci Steele, who was reunited with 3-year-old Schyler Steele when she arrived 
in Sweden on Sunday, is scheduled to return home with him tonight, said her 
father, Pete Helsley. 
</P>
<P>
"She's happy that it's over with," said Helsley, who spoke to his daughter 
Wednesday morning, "but she sounded absolutely exhausted. I don't think she's 
had any sleep since she's been over there." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Steele, the boy's father, remains in a Swedish jail pending extradition 
by U.S. officials. Steele is the object of an investigation by Riverside and 
Orange county authorities into allegations of grand theft, forgery and bad 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from jail, Steele said he will fight extradition, and he 
criticized the Swedish court's custody decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was fair at all," Steele said. The court "should not have 
made a decision today, and they should have had a doctor look at Schyler for 
psychological tests." 
</P>
<P>
Steele, 32, who maintains he is innocent of criminal activities, said he has 
hired a Swedish attorney to replace the one appointed for him. Rod Perkins, an 
investigator in the Riverside County district attorney's office, said Steele 
can fight extradition at a hearing before Swedish authorities. Perkins said he 
did not know when the hearing would take place. 
</P>
<P>
After the criminal matters are resolved, Steele said, he will return to the 
United States and appeal for custody of Schyler. 
</P>
<P>
The Steele family drama began March 11, when Steele and Schyler were 
vacationing on Santa Catalina Island. Steele's girlfriend, Susanne Pettersson 
-- a former nanny for the Steeles -- made a frantic call to authorities to 
report that father and son had not returned from an outing in an inflatable 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard authorities combed the area, unaware that Steele and the boy were 
en route to Europe. The pair spent about 7 weeks in Sweden before Steele was 
arrested Friday at the home of Pettersson, who joined them in Sweden a few days 
after the boating hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Steele said he was frustrated that his visitation rights had been cut from 4 
days a week to 2 weekends a month. Marci Steele, 27, has been living with her 
parents since the couple's bitter split in 1987. She has legal custody of 
Schyler and the couple's other son, 2-year-old Garrett.

A HABITAT HAVEN; 
</P>
<P>
UPPER NEWPORT BAY JOINS STATE PROGRAM THAT WILL RAISE PROTECTION MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Standing on a low mound not far from the water's edge, Frank Robinson looked 
Wednesday across the marshy expanse of Upper Newport Bay and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fabulous program," Robinson, a longtime crusader for preservation of 
the bay, finally said. "It's going to make it that much harder for this 
delicate setting ever to be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Protecting the 752 acres of wildlife habitat in Upper Newport Bay has long been 
a mission for Robinson and other county environmentalists. That's why they view 
the area's inclusion in the newly created California Wildlands Program as a big 
step forward. 
</P>
<P>
To officially mark the beginning of the program in Southern California, state 
and local officials, biologists and nature enthusiasts gathered Wednesday along 
Back Bay Drive in Newport Beach for a brief ceremony. Upper Newport Bay is one 
of nine areas in California, totaling 44,068 acres, included in the wild lands 
program, which state Department of Fish and Game officials say is the first of 
its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the department's budget for acquiring, maintaining and protecting 
wild lands has been paid for almost entirely by the sales 
</P>
<P>
of hunting and fishing licenses. The wild lands program is a bid to generate 
millions of dollars in new revenue by charging, among others, bird-watchers, 
hikers and wildlife photographers who are on nature tours $2 a day or $10 a 
year to use the newly designated wild lands areas. 
</P>
<P>
The program is projected to raise about $5 million for the department during 
its first 2 years. That money will be used to staff each area with full-time 
biologists as well as to maintain and protect the habitats. Access to each wild 
lands area will be largely limited to hiking to reduce the impact on plant and 
wildlife species. 
</P>
<P>
"Our No. 1 priority is preservation of these areas, but to do that we'll need 
to get non-hunters and (non-) fishermen to help bear that cost," state Fish and 
Game spokesman Ted Thomas said. "About 85% of Californians don't fish or hunt, 
but surveys and voting patterns indicate there is growing interest among state 
residents to preserve open space and wild lands. We want to tap that interest." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Upper Newport Bay, there will be two other areas in Southern California 
in the wild lands program: The 5,000-acre Imperial Wildlife Area near the 
Salton Sea and the 4,700-acre San Jacinto Wildlife Area in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The program at Upper Newport Bay will run differently from those in the other 
eight areas in the state. Because Back Bay Drive already affords public access 
to the refuge, only those who sign up for the agency's guided nature walks and 
demonstrations will be assessed a fee. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the statewide program will benefit efforts to expand and enhance 
the Upper Newport Bay habitat. The most promising development is the possible 
addition of 117 acres to the refuge, including 60 acres on the west side of the 
bay, near Irvine Boulevard and University Drive, where a permanent nature 
center would be built, in part with money from the wild lands program. 
</P>
<P>
The 117 acres are owned by the Irvine Co., but in an agreement being drawn up 
the company will give the property to the county in exchange for development 
considerations elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
During the dedication ceremony Wednesday, County Board of Supervisors Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley expressed hope that a final agreement on the land deal can be 
reached this summer so the county and the Department of Fish and Game can begin 
to plan the nature center. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the facility and how to pay for it have not been worked out, but 
Robinson said it will be large enough for local nature and environmental groups 
to hold meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us have long wanted such a facility to help validate the efforts of 
those who have worked so hard to bring attention to this bay," said Robinson, 
past president of Friends of Upper Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
He has spent nearly 25 years on various projects to protect the bay and 
believes that the area's inclusion in the wild lands program is an added 
safeguard against urban encroachment into the habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, many of us were worried if we turned our back for a minute, 
this would be gone," Robinson said. "But the Department of Fish and Game has in 
a way institutionalized our cause, which adds another layer of protection." 
</P>
<P>
Preservation of Upper Newport Bay was virtually assured in 1975, when state 
officials bought the 752-acre reserve from the Irvine Co. for $3.4 million. 
From August to April, it offers refuge to more than 200 species of birds.

POLICE SEIZE 150 POUNDS OF COCAINE, ARREST 4 IN RAIDS 
</P>

<P>
Fullerton and Anaheim police confiscated 150 pounds of cocaine and arrested 
four people suspected of trying to sell it in raids ending Wednesday at three 
Los Angeles County residences. 
</P>
<P>
Police also seized assault-style weapons and $250,000 in cash suspected of 
being linked to drugs at homes in Artesia, Bell and Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
The police agencies were led to the contraband by people suspected of being 
drug dealers whom the officers first observed in the Fullerton area early 
Tuesday during a separate drug investigation, Fullerton Police Capt. Lee DeVore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the day we saw enough activity in transferring of drugs into cars and 
switching cars that we were able to get search warrants for three residences," 
said DeVore, whose department headed the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
After obtaining search warrants from a Downey Municipal Court judge on Tuesday 
night, DeVore said 23 police officers conducted the raids in teams without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cocaine was discovered in the Artesia residence, as were the money 
and weapons, DeVore said. Police seized two AK-47 assault rifles and several 
semiautomatic handguns. Three of the four suspects were also arrested at the 
Artesia residence. A fourth was detained at the Bell residence. 
</P>
<P>
Booked into the Fullerton City Jail on suspicion of sale of cocaine were: Jorge 
Cano, 27, of Artesia; his wife, Maria, 21; Jose Lopez, 21, of Los Angeles, and 
Jose Heras, 28, of Bell. All four were being held under $1-million bonds for 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police estimated the street value of the cocaine at $22 million. They 
said the seizure ranked as their second largest, behind the March, 1988, 
confiscation of 330 pounds of cocaine. The drugs will be held as evidence and 
then destroyed, DeVore said. The $250,000 suspected of being drug money may be 
returned to local police for their use in future drug investigations, he added. 
</P>
<P>
DeVore said the cocaine seized this week apparently originated in Colombia, as 
"Republic of Colombia" was stamped on sacks containing the powdery white drug. 
Two of the suspects, Cano and his wife, are of Colombian descent, DeVore said.

AUTHORS TAKE LISTENERS BEHIND SCENES

<P>
Maureen Reagan, biographer A. Scott Berg and novelist Amy Tan attracted a 
sold-out crowd of 740 to The Times Orange County Edition's second annual Book 
and Author Luncheon at the Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Berg described the 9 years he spent writing "Goldwyn: A Biography," his account 
of the legendary movie mogul. Tan, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, 
described her childhood and read excerpts from her best-selling novel, "The Joy 
Luck Club." Reagan, whose memoir "First Father, First Daughter" offers an 
intimate portrait of Ronald Reagan, described her father as "a very special 
person." 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling of him as a special person is a kinship that has been felt for 
many years by constituents of his in the United States, both as an actor and as 
a politician," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Of her book, which includes her view of her father's 8 years in Washington, 
Reagan said: "I thought it was time to tell the story from the position of 
someone who liked being there, and who says that it's OK that it's over, and 
didn't feel the kind of sour grapes (that made it) necessary to write the 
kiss-and-tell books that we have seen." 
</P>
<P>
"When I told the President I was going to be involved in this project," Reagan 
recalled, "he very kindly said, 'Oh, not another book!' I said, 'You don't 
understand. The mark of a successful administration is the number of books that 
are written about it. But they're supposed to be favorable. Perhaps I can start 
a trend.' "

TUSTIN TIGHTENS TITLE RACE AFTER BEATING SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Saddleback High School stayed close to Tustin for seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
But the Roadrunners committed two errors in the eighth and Tustin escaped with 
a 2-0 victory in a Sea View League softball game Wednesday at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
The victory by Tustin (13-7, 10-2) avenges an earlier loss to Saddleback. Now 
Tustin can clinch a share of the league title with another victory over 
Saddleback (21-3, 11-1) Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback managed only one hit off Shannon Ellis (5-6), who struck out nine 
and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
. Tustin got eight hits, two of them in the eighth inning, off Desi Abrego. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the top of the eighth, Laura Teal grounded a single down the 
left-field line. Left fielder Claudia Rodriguez fumbled the ball and Teal 
advanced to second on the error. 
</P>
<P>
Jayme Ondracek beat out her second bunt single, with Teal advancing to third. 
</P>
<P>
Abrego intentionally walked Ellis, who came into the game batting .438, to load 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Mazanet hit a high bouncer to first baseman Blanca Silva, who misjudged 
the ball, and Teal scored on the error. Allison Potenza grounded out to short, 
scoring Ondracek. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Carstens led off the Saddleback eighth with a single. Right fielder Denise 
Thomas fumbled the ball for a two-base error. 
</P>
<P>
Silva grounded to Ellis, who looked Carstens back to third before throwing out 
Silva. Ellis then struck out Ana Montoya. With lead-off batter Rodriguez at the 
plate, Ellis threw a wild pitch and Carstens attempted to steal home. But 
catcher McGuire recovered and flipped it to Ellis, who tagged Carstens to end 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our bats were asleep today," Saddleback Coach Yvonne Alonzo said. 
"Defensively we did well. Just offensively, we didn't produce." 
</P>
<P>
In the South Coast League: 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley 2, Mission Viejo 1 -- Jennifer Simth (9-11) pitched a 
one-hitter and struck out seven at Capistrano Valley (10-12, 2-5). Mission 
Viejo is 4-3 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 10, Dana Hills 1 -- Jennifer Brundage (14-6) pitched a three-hitter with 
12 strikeouts for visiting Irvine (15-6, 6-1). Brundage has also had three 
hits, including a three-run home run, and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 7, San Clemente 4 -- El Toro scored four runs in the fifth and two in 
the sixth to win at San Clemente. Winning pitcher Paige Lauby struggled, 
striking out 8, but walking 11 and allowing six hits. El Toro is 4-3 in league. 
San Clemente is 3-4 in league and 8-11 overall.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S UNLIKELY BIG MAN IN ANTEATERS' LINEUP 
</P>

<P>
OK, enough with the short jokes already. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Rodriguez, UC Irvine's 5-foot-9 sophomore, uh, shortstop, has heard 
enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
There was the time he injured his shoulder when he was pinned while wrestling 
with his nephew. And get this, his nephew is 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates won't let him forget that one. Nor will they stop reminding 
Rodriguez, whom they've dubbed "Big Guy," that he's the smallest No. 3 hitter 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
That might be true, but it's an insignificant distinction to Rodriguez. Size be 
darned, Rodriguez is a tower of power for Irvine. His .358 batting average and 
33 runs batted in lead the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's also probably the only No. 3 hitter without a home run," Irvine Coach 
Mike Gerakos joked. 
</P>
<P>
He also is, according to Gerakos, the Anteaters' most consistent player, a 
quiet leader whose size makes him the object of friendly kidding and whose play 
is impressive nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
Gerakos never had any doubts about Rodriguez and that's why he recruited him 
from Westminster High School. 
</P>
<P>
His size didn't stop Rodriguez from batting .459 and making two All-Southern 
Section teams. Then he was 5-8 and 145 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he could play without a doubt," Gerakos said. "He's just gotten better 
and better." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez batted .274 with 26 RBIs as a freshman, stepping into the starting 
shortstop position. He struck out just 12 times in 253 plate appearances. Not 
bad for a freshman, but not as good as Rodriguez had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
His disappointment drove him all the way to Kansas. In this case a summer 
league team based in Liberal, Kan. Rodriguez spent the summer living with a 
local family and playing baseball almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Irvine with a wealth of confidence and, as Gerakos discovered, a 
noticeable Midwestern drawl. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a matter of playing more and seeing more college pitchers," 
Rodriguez said. "It was a confidence builder. I haven't changed anything from 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the summer league with and against players from nationally ranked 
schools such as Miami, Texas and Texas A&amp;M helped. Rodriguez watched the 
others and learned all he could. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my chance to go out and see the world," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, he liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get a lot of attention," he said. "I guess it's because of my size. 
People see this little guy come up as the No. 3 hitter and they probably start 
wondering a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, shortstops aren't very big, but as Rodriguez said, "I'm just 
too small." 
</P>
<P>
Still, his small stature hasn't detracted from Rodriguez's performance on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than being one of our support players, he's been one of the leaders," 
Gerakos said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's vote against a proposal to further study funding a football team at 
Irvine effectively ended one man's two-year effort to get a team started. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Breslo, a senior majoring in political science and a former defensive end 
at Claremont High, had gone to great lengths to convince the student body, the 
athletic department and anyone else who would listen that Irvine could -- and 
should -- have a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division III football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd given up studying this quarter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But with his proposal defeated in the student elections last week, Breslo's 
work appears to have fallen on deaf ears. It was Breslo's third try at getting 
Irvine students to vote on such a proposal. Two other attempts failed before 
getting to the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Breslo, who is graduating this spring and hopes to attend law school soon, said 
Tuesday he is giving up his battle. 
</P>
<P>
"We had six guys working on the project the last few months, but three of us 
had been working longer," Breslo said. "One of the guys is transferring to 
Illinois, where they have a very good football team." 
</P>
<P>
Breslo said he was disappointed in the results of the proposal, essentially an 
opinion poll asking whether Irvine students favored having a football team at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
The students rejected the proposal, 1,557 to 1,216. According to Breslo, 
confusion in the weeks leading up the election over how much students would be 
assessed to cover the costs of the program led to the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had conducted a poll early in the school year. Of the 200 students 
he contacted, Breslo said 88% were in favor. He said 70% said they would be 
willing to pay to start the program. 
</P>
<P>
Breslo said he had a budget of $150 to run his campaign and the help of the 
other five students. 
</P>
<P>
"I put two years into it," he said. "I'm afraid all my work is going to amount 
to nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Signing: Cherie Birtwistle, a 6-4 center from Victoria, Canada, has signed a 
letter of intent to play for the women's basketball team next season. 
</P>
<P>
Birtwistle averaged 33 points and 15 rebounds a game for Stelly's School in 
Victoria. She is the first foreign recruit by the Irvine women's team. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a gargantuan match," men's tennis Coach Greg Patton said of the 
Anteaters' showdown with UCLA Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"(It's) probably the biggest college dual match in the nation this year. It is 
not just any dual match, this is for the stakes -- to be No. 1 in the country 
before NCAAs." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-ranked Irvine plays host to top-ranked UCLA Saturday at 1 p.m. in the 
Anteaters' final match before the NCAA championships May 19-27 at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine won its third consecutive Big West Conference championship at Ojai last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's track and field teams are taking this weekend off from 
competition to gear up for next week's Big West Conference championships at 
Cerritos College. Marc Goulet's fast 1,500-meter race and a 17-foot pole vault 
by Jeff Williams highlighted Sunday's Irvine Invitational. Goulet's time was 3 
minutes 46.25 seconds. He missed the NCAA qualifying standard by four seconds. 
Treg Scott of the Arizona State Track Club won in 3:44.18, breaking the track 
record of 3:44.6 set in 1976 by former Irvine star Steve Scott.

SANTA MARGARITA CO. WILL DEVELOP MORE OF ITS OWN BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Margarita Co., an enormous landowner in southern Orange County, has 
decided to build and develop more of its own apartments, stores and factories, 
a major change in the way the company does business. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the company had built most of the commercial buildings in the new 
town of Rancho Santa Margarita in partnership with other local developers such 
as Koll Co. and SDC Development Co. Or it had simply sold its land to 
developers, who then built their own buildings on it. 
</P>
<P>
The company may still do those kinds of deals, Executive Vice President Thomas 
Blum said in an interview this week. But it is also anxious to build its own 
portfolio of buildings in which it will not have to share ownership with 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
The company had planned to do its own developing eventually, Blum said. In 
fact, it has already developed a few buildings by itself: apartments and two 
industrial buildings now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
But the loss of three key employees since December prompted President Anthony 
R. Moiso and Blum to "stand back and take a hard look at where we're going," 
Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
The result was to make the move now, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the change also allows it to build a broader range of 
buildings, since it will no longer be dependent on finding a partner for a 
particular project. 
</P>
<P>
The move reflects a new confidence on the part of the company that it has the 
expertise to develop buildings on its own, local experts said. 
</P>
<P>
It also reflects the company's desire to keep for itself what it obviously 
expects to be very valuable buildings near a new freeway, the Foothill 
Corridor, those experts said. That could be built through the town as early as 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
The second-largest private landholder in the county, after the Irvine Co., 
Santa Margarita owns 40,000 acres in booming southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
When the new town of Rancho Santa Margarita is completed in 15 years on 5,000 
of those acres, it will number 50,000 residents and provide 26,000 jobs, the 
company says. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it now anticipates building about 200,000 square feet of 
commercial space a year. The majority will be free-standing industrial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Of 1,100 apartment units built or under construction now, the company has 
developed about half on its own and plans to build more, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the commercial buildings will go up in the town's 400-acre business 
park -- already home to 60 companies and 3,000 employees -- and 230 acres in 
the town's planned downtown, now completely undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
One of the benefits of joint ventures is spreading the risk of development. But 
Blum said the company is not worried that it might be caught overextended in an 
economic downturn, which is believed by some economists to be in the near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, Blum said: The financial partner that Santa Margarita invited to 
help develop the entire town in 1985, Copley Real Estate Advisors, a subsidiary 
of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. Copley provides Santa Margarita Co. a 
strong financial partner. 
</P>
<P>
The company does not plan to add many employees, Blum said. It may be taking a 
lesson from the Irvine Co., which hired hundreds of people in the past but has 
been laying them off as it contracts out more of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not hung up on having a lot of people," Blum said. "We want to stay 
small." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita Co. now employs 170, including employees in a mortgage unit, an 
escrow subsidiary and a cable television venture. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it was promoting two employees to manage its new businesses. 
A. Martin Stradtman, the former director of commercial and industrial sales, 
was named vice president for the business properties group. 
</P>
<P>
And Dennis Bean III, formerly director of project development, becomes vice 
president for the residential investment properties group.

PACIFIC SYMPHONY TAKING CLASSICS TO LATINO COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ingmar Bergman's magical film of Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute" begins with a 
scene few can forget. During the Overture, the camera pans the faces of an 
ethnically and culturally diverse audience, and for a few moments, everyone is 
taken by the music to a single place. 
</P>
<P>
This United Nations-esque vision is not likely to take place in a real U.S. 
concert hall, however. Crowds for such music, especially in Orange County, tend 
to be rich, old -- and white. 
</P>
<P>
Is there systematic exclusion of minorities? Rodolfo Montejano of Santa Ana 
thinks the barriers are more psychological and financial than racial. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, it's intimidation," said Montejano, a lawyer, who compared 
attending a first such concert "to going into an expensive restaurant for the 
first time." People avoid that uncomfortable feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Montejano thinks that too few organizations make "good-faith efforts . . 
. to attract (minorities) into the arts or to the (Orange County) Performing 
Arts Center. Classical music generally has not been made accessible to 
Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
Montejano and Pacific Symphony are addressing the issue by taking music to the 
people and providing free concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Current plans include three Latino outreach concerts, beginning tonight at St. 
Jeanne de Lestonnac School in Tustin. The program will honor Father Jaime Soto, 
the Diocese of Orange's newly appointed vicar for the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
The second concert will be on Mexican Independence Day, Sept. 16, at Centennial 
Park in Santa Ana; the third will be part of the Las Posadas Festival Dec. 16 
at Santa Ana Stadium. Attendance tonight will be limited to 600, however, 
because of the size of the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken Montejano is chairman of Pacific Symphony's Latino advisory 
committee and chairman of the Santiago Club, a 4-year-old countywide 
organization that aims "to enhance and advance the interests of the Hispanics 
in Orange County in education, in economics, in the job field and in the arts, 
in culture." 
</P>
<P>
The 120-member club, based in Santa Ana, pays for programs to fight drug abuse, 
offers scholarships and provides other social service activities to county 
Latinos. It also extends support to South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa and 
Bowers Museum in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
With aid from the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the club will sponsor Pacific 
Symphony's concerts for $8,000 to $13,000 each. The orchestra will underwrite 
each concert for about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Montejano hopes that introducing Latinos to the orchestra will lead them to 
become subscribers and donors. 
</P>
<P>
Are these efforts a bit upscale for low-income Latinos? Montejano defended the 
effort: "We are very pleased with what we are doing (in social service areas). 
Now we also feel it necessary to make an entry into the arts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Economically, you first worry about the basics. . . . As you progress through 
the economic and social spectrum, you start looking at other programs. And 
there is a substantial amount of discretionary income in the Hispanic area. 
We're just trying to redirect some of that discretionary income and direct 
interest into the classics and the arts and the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Future plans include an in-school instrument loan program for students who 
cannot afford them. "Many Hispanic students have beautiful talent (that) needs 
to be cultivated," he said. "Without access to instruction and instruments, 
that talent goes to waste." 
</P>
<P>
So Latinos benefit by having easier access to classical music. What's in it for 
the orchestra? For one thing, outreach programs look very good to state and 
federal funding agencies; the California Arts Council, for instance, recognizes 
outreach efforts as a criterion for determining grants. 
</P>
<P>
What measures has Montejano taken to assure that Pacific Symphony's efforts are 
not mere tokenism? "I serve on the board of directors of the orchestra, and as 
a board member I am going to ensure that it is not tokenism," he said. "But in 
my discussion with the executive director (Louis G. Spisto) and members of the 
board, I sense a total good-faith effort to truly achieve this object. The 
leadership of the orchestra came to us in the community, asked us to help and 
to tell them how to reach the community. We helped create and implement the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were not done in good faith, we would not be with the project. Our track 
record has established all that." 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said the philosophy of the Latino arts program is "to broaden the 
audience for classical music. There is an audience for classical music that 
exists beyond the walls of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and, we 
believe, it is our responsibility to become involved directly. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanic community is a very large and important component of the Orange 
County population . . . (one that) has heretofore not been very much involved 
with the orchestra's programs." 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said the orchestra's efforts are not contingent upon an Arts Council 
grant: "With or without California Arts Council money, we're doing it. The 
Pacific Symphony itself is funding three concerts out of our operating budget." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the orchestra has hired John Palacio as its Latino program adviser 
to help ensure development of its outreach projects. Palacio is Santa Ana's 
former Latino affairs manager and an executive assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can't afford not to do this," Spisto said. "It's critical. We have 
a responsibility to this community. It's not only what's required of us as 
presenters of classical music but what is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in Santa Ana. Our home is in Santa Ana. And we receive a great deal of 
support from the city. . . . We are in great debt to the city of Santa Ana and 
feel absolutely compelled to provide service to people of Santa Ana who are not 
coming" to concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm personally delighted that we are finally getting something off the ground 
that we are have been promising for a long time. We are doing it the right way. 
We have the key leaders in the community working with us. This is not a program 
decided by the management of Pacific Symphony in isolation, but developed in 
consultation with and directed by the community with members of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking our cue from the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas Richman, assistant conductor of Pacific Symphony, will lead the 
orchestra in the first of three free Latino outreach concerts tonight at 7:30 
at St. Jeanne de Lestonnac School Auditorium, 16791 E. Main St. in Tustin. The 
program will include works by Vivaldi, Rossini and Bizet. A reception will 
begin at 6:30 p.m. Information: (714) 836-6584 or (714) 973-1300.

'DEPECHE MODE 101' IS AN OIL-WATER MIXTURE THAT TREATS BAND UNFAIRLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Depeche Mode is a fascinating pop group, and director D. A. Pennebaker can be 
an interesting musical documentarian, but their pairing proves to be a classic 
oil-and-water mismatch in "Depeche Mode 101." 
</P>
<P>
The oil here is teen-favorite Depeche Mode, an English synthesizer group that 
combines deep and unremittingly dark themes with slick, pre-programmed, 
ominously compelling dance music. The water is unslick, spontaneity-loving 
Pennebaker and his film collaborators, David Dawkins and Chris Hegedus, who 
never once attempt to delve below the service to peek at what substance might 
lie beneath. The result makes the band and its young followers look much, much 
sillier than they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
Pennebaker's documentary technique is usually to let the hand-held cameras roll 
and trust that something interesting will happen. When you're filming a roving 
Bob Dylan at the peak of his powers, as Pennebaker did in "Don't Look Back," 
catching interesting things is a given. But figuring out what makes reticent 
Depeche Mode or its rabid following tick would take a bit more work -- work 
that hasn't even been attempted in this remarkably unrevealing product. 
</P>
<P>
The grainy "101" intercuts between uneven but great-sounding concert footage, 
scenes of backstage banality with the band and its crew and scenes of an even 
more banal crop of East Coast teen-agers who have been hired to follow the tour 
out West on a bus, especially for the film. If the point was to deflate Depeche 
Mode's godlike standing among its fans, or to portray those fans as uneducated, 
trendy twerps who have no idea what the music is all about, it's been well 
accomplished here. But one suspects that there is no point, or point of view, 
to all this random cinema verite. 
</P>
<P>
 Depeche Mode is not yet a national superstar act, but in some cities, 
especially Los Angeles, where a Rose Bowl concert in June drew more than 
60,000, Mode mania resembles Beatlemania at its peak. Indeed, at a screening 
for radio contest-winners earlier this week, female screams rendered the first 
few minutes of the loudly projected film inaudible. A quick flash of singer 
David Gahan in his underwear almost brought down the house.. A few scant 
moments in "101" capture fans' sexual/philosophic mania in something close to a 
meaningful context, like one extended, telling shot of a hysterical girl 
shouting along with the bitter lyrics of "Blasphemous Rumours," which includes 
the chorus: "I think God's got a sick sense of humor, and when I die, I expect 
to find him laughing." (Watching Gahan exhort the crowd to sing and clap along 
with dour ditties, you may intuit that someone besides the Almighty has a sick 
sense of humor.) 
</P>
<P>
But Pennebaker, Dawkins and Hegedus query neither band nor followers about the 
content or appeal of the music. One former Pennebaker subject, Dylan, used to 
sing about a Mr. Jones who knew something was happening around him but didn't 
quite know what it was; this time, Pennebaker seems to be that Mr. Jones. What 
a waste of a phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depeche Mode 101" opens Friday at the AMC MainPlace in Santa Ana, playing 
Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays only. Information: (714) 972-8500.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: SURF ROCK'S HISTORY WRAPPED UP BY A LONGTIME DEVOTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert J. Dalley was hooked in an instant when he heard the surf rock 
instrumental "Pipeline" barreling over the radio one day in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley, 15 at the time, bought an electric guitar with his paper route money 
and set out to become part of the instrumental surf music scene that crested 
during the early '60s, then ebbed with the arrival of the Beatles. But it was 
with a typewriter, rather than with a Fender Stratocaster, that Dalley 
ultimately wound up writing his chapter in surf rock history. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he wrote 41 chapters. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley's book, "Surfin' Guitars: Instrumental Surf Bands of the Sixties," 
devotes a chapter to each of 41 bands from the peak days of surf rock, 
including 12 hailing from Orange County. In each case, Dalley hunted up former 
members, got them to reminisce into a tape recorder, and compiled the 
histories, memorabilia and discographies that fill his 421-page, independently 
published soft-cover volume. 
</P>
<P>
"Surfin' Guitars" is a specialty project that will be of value and interest 
mainly to committed surf rock fans and early-'60s pop history buffs: Of the 41 
groups chronicled, only five ever placed a song in the Billboard Top 100. 
Dalley's plain but usually serviceable prose won't rescue any of the lesser 
lights from obscurity. But by giving a basic recounting of each group's story, 
along with reproductions of their photos, posters and press clippings, he has 
managed to safeguard them from oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
For Dalley, now 40, the book originated 10 years ago with his own attempt to 
regain a bit of youthful spark. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going crazy, not being in a band, not doing anything," said the 
friendly, broad-built Azusa resident who makes his living reproducing documents 
for microfilm. "The first thing I thought of was, 'Let's play some surf 
music."' 
</P>
<P>
Dalley, who grew up inland in Covina and never learned to surf, formed a surf 
rock revival band, the Surf Raiders, that stayed together through most of the 
1980s. In trying to recapture the authentic early '60s sound, he began to hunt 
for original surf music recordings. He also sought out two former members of 
the Surfaris, the band that created "Wipe Out," one of the most enduring and 
influential rock instrumentals. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley's aim was only to ask their advice on how to replicate the '60s surf 
sound. But the tape-recorded talks ended up forming the basis for an article 
that he submitted to Goldmine, the record collectors' magazine. Dalley soon 
began to write a regular surf music column for Goldmine, and he continued to 
seek out interviews with original surf bands. After deciding to compile a book, 
he cast his net as widely as possible, with the aim of making a comprehensive 
surf rock history. Dalley even enlisted the help of a private detective to 
track down a charter member of one hard-to-trace band. 
</P>
<P>
While Dalley rarely strays from his straight biographical narratives into 
analysis or social commentary, "Surfin' Guitars" depicts a musical period that 
had the qualities of innocence and a naive creativity -- qualities all but 
snuffed out in today's bureaucratized, conglomerated music industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Chantays, from Santa Ana, were teen-age musical novices when they started 
in 1961, inspired by Dick Dale, the Orange County surf-rock pioneer who emerges 
repeatedly in the book as a key influence on other bands. Within a year of 
taking up their instruments, the Chantays had written and recorded "Pipeline," 
the No. 4 national hit that hooked Dalley on surf music. 
</P>
<P>
Except for rap music, a grass-roots, cheap-to-produce form that pop's corporate 
masters haven't yet found a way to control, such sudden rises are virtually 
inconceivable today. 
</P>
<P>
Recording and promoting music has become a slow, costly, calculated business 
guided by long-term marketing strategies. One-hit, out-of-the-blue wonders like 
the Chantays -- or the Pyramids, whose "Penetration" was also a Top 20 surf hit 
-- simply don't get signed nowadays by major labels, which look at bands either 
as tax write-offs or as expensive, long-term investments. It is true that 
smaller, independent labels sign such bands all the time, but no prominent pop 
radio station seems to have the gumption to run with an unknown act's song and 
give it the airing it may deserve. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, surprise hits like "Pipeline" and "Wipe Out" were the norm. What the 
music business gives us today is a world in which surprise is barely possible. 
Aside from rap -- which requires the guidance of a technologically savvy 
producer -- there is no place in the pop mainstream today for the kinds of 
musically unschooled, naive enthusiasts who gave us surf music and its direct 
heirs, mid-'60s garage-rock and psychedelic rock. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiast's spirit lives with Robert Dalley. Before he could go to press 
with his book, he said, he had to come up with about $13,000 to pay for 
printing. He raised some of it by selling his guitar and amplifiers and -- 
after committing his favorite songs to tape -- by auctioning his collection of 
rare surf records. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done everything I can to promote surf music," Dalley said. "My book is 
the culmination of it. I don't see what more I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Dalley figures he eventually will at least break even by selling his first 
printing of 2,000 copies through an international network of surf music fans. 
The book, published in November, is on sale at Music Market in Costa Mesa and 
Soest Guitar Repair in Orange, Dalley said. Copies, priced at $28, also are 
available by mail from Robert J. Dalley at Dept. OC, 6209 Oakbank Drive, Azusa, 
Calif. 91702. 
</P>
<P>
As for hearing the old surf rock style played live, Dalley said, several 
revival bands and a handful of reformed original surf rock combos still 
perform, including the Surfaris and the Chantays. Dick Dale and the Deltones 
remain an Orange County rock institution; they can be heard Friday night at 
Night Moves in Huntington Beach. Information: (714) 840-6118. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra's Mind Over 4 looks like a shoo-in for hardest working band in Orange 
County (if not the known universe). The quartet, which blends pounding 
thrash-metal with art-rock atmospherics, went into For the Record studios in 
Orange on last Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to singer Spike Xavier, and 
emerged Saturday at 3 p.m. after nonstop recording and mixing of a new, 12-song 
album. 
</P>
<P>
After a few hours' rest and relaxation, they played a Saturday night show at 
Night Moves. 
</P>
<P>
Why such a hectic schedule? Mind Over 4 recently signed a European recording 
deal with Destiny Records, a West German company, and wants to have the album 
out by late May when the band will begin a 2 1/2-month tour of Europe (with the 
Vandals, satiric punk rockers with Orange County origins of their own). 
</P>
<P>
Mind Over 4 was due to leave Wednesday night on a cross-country tour that will 
end with a showcase gig at CBGB's, the famed New York City alternative rock 
bar. Then it is on to West Germany for the start of the European tour, which 
also will take the band through Holland, Yugoslavia, France, Spain, Italy, 
England and Ireland. The Vandals will go on to Iceland; Mind Over 4 will fly 
back to New York in late August, play its way back across the country and 
arrive in Orange County just in time to start recording yet another album, this 
time for Powerhouse Records, a new Orange County-based label. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to take at least 5 days recording that one," Xavier said. In 
all, he said, Mind Over 4 expects to play 110 shows over the next 120 days -- a 
schedule with the potential to turn the most leathery-lunged singer's vocal 
chords into thin spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
No problem, Xavier said. "I got the magic potion: hot tea and peach brandy 
right before I go on stage. It totally works."

A MATTER OF VALUES, POLITICAL SEMANTICS

<P>
When a citizen group decided last year to call itself the Irvine Values 
Coalition, member Christina Shea had some misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
Shea had no qualms about the group's goal, which is to force Irvine to remove a 
reference to gays from an anti-discrimination ordinance. But she found the 
group's name troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'm comfortable with our name, because it has the connotation 
of being a right-wing, odd-duck group," said Shea, mother of three and member 
of the steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's sad that because you may be more conservative and have values 
that are more conservative," she said, "that people look at you and think 
there's something odd about you. I'm not that kind of person -- at least, I 
don't think I am. So I wish we had named ourselves something else; I don't know 
what." 
</P>
<P>
In a decade when religion and politics have increasingly commingled, the Irvine 
group is the latest county organization trying to ward off what is seen as 
assaults on "traditional values." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Peotter, leader of the Irvine coalition, said he knows that the 
designation traditional values upsets some people. "It'll stir up some people 
who say, 'Gee, exactly whose values are they using? They certainly don't 
represent my values.' 
</P>
<P>
"When we say traditional values," he said, "what we're referring to are 
traditional values that come from the Founding Fathers, that are repeated and 
shown throughout the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution -- 
God-given, inalienable rights. So it refers to the Judeo-Christian set of 
values, and that's the background that we're coming from." 
</P>
<P>
The rights ordinance adopted by the Irvine City Council on July 12 bars 
discrimination based on a person's race, color, religion, national origin, 
gender, age, marital status, physical handicap or sexual orientation. In March, 
leaders of the Irvine Values Coalition delivered 5,433 validated petition 
signatures to City Hall, forcing the City Council either to eliminate the 
sexual orientation designation or place the issue before voters. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to act on that choice Tuesday. The issue could be 
placed on the ballot as early as November or be delayed until June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Values Coalition was formed last summer and had about 75 original 
members, but six to 10 people have met somewhat regularly and done most of the 
planning since then, the group's leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
Peotter said his group does not want to discriminate against gays but is 
opposed to the ordinance because members believe that it gives gays special 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We're against special rights for any group, and particularly homosexuals, 
because it's a group based on behavior," Peotter said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance "more or less gives legislative approval of their life style, 
which I don't think is acceptable," he said. "What people do in their own 
bedroom is their own business, but when it comes out of the bedroom and is 
legislated over the rest of the citizens, that's where I have problems with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The petition backers are concerned that Irvine has endorsed homosexuality at 
the expense of the "traditional family," Peotter said. The gay life style, he 
said, "doesn't lend itself to the traditional family. I don't think Irvine 
should be in business to promote the alternative family. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the city's interest and promotion of day care shows Irvine really 
wants to be a pro-family type of community. That's not to say homosexuals 
aren't welcome, but the promotion of their life style is not in the same line 
as being pro-family." 
</P>
<P>
Peotter said the group is not concerned with allegations that it is imposing 
its values on others: "It's not a matter of if there are going to be values; 
it's a matter of whose values they're going to be. We think the traditional 
family and their values haven't been represented. In the case of the human 
rights ordinance, the homosexual group imposed its values on the rest of the 
community, and we're reacting to that." 
</P>
<P>
The group is forcing the issue, Peotter said, because "the thing that got most 
of us is: If we don't take a stand now, where do we take a stand? There's got 
to be a point where there is no compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"As we've gotten into this, we really see that Irvine is just one of the 
building blocks in a move to do it (pass similar ordinances) throughout Orange 
County. If we can make a stand now in Irvine, it will do a lot to stop similar 
ordinances from passing in other cities."

"Landscaping can be millions of dollars. . . . You can spend half a million on 
a chandelier without batting an eye." -- Bruce Nelson, real estate broker, Time 
magazine, May 1 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nelson hated Time magazine's Living page last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sloppy, stupid article," he said Sunday, licking deep-dish-pizza 
crumbs off his fingers at the DeAngelo mansion in Cowan Heights. The article 
discussed "Homeowning, Hollywood Style: Living it up by tearing 'em (beloved 
old movie-star mansions) down." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson hopes an upcoming Wall Street Journal article will put his work in a 
better light. And if that doesn't do it, maybe his upcoming guest spot on 
television's "20/20" will do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
Like the acreage and mansions he sells, Nelson is hot property. His real estate 
listings have included the posh dirt -- once crowned with Bing Crosby's pad -- 
upon which TV producer Aaron Spelling is erecting his controversial 
mega-mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the most successful seller of residential property in the country," Nelson 
said with a small smile. "But don't ask me why. I'm not one to toot my own 
horn. Ask my clients." 
</P>
<P>
One of Nelson's new clients is Michael DeAngelo, owner of Anaheim-based 
Clothestime Inc. DeAngelo and his wife, Pat, have recently turned over their 
$22-million, 35,000-square-foot estate to Nelson for sale to the highest 
bidder. "It's a little much to maintain," Pat confessed on Sunday during a 
brunch staged at the Moroccan-style digs by the Pacific Symphony. "We're 
heading for the beach." 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 guests donned their Sunday best to sip something cool and nibble 
on comestibles as they floated through the hilltop mansion. On view: 10 
breathtaking bedrooms, a discotheque, a gymnasium, a beauty parlor, rushing 
waterfalls, an inside-and-out koi pond and 
on-a-clear-day-you-can-see-Casablanca vistas. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have a dock," deadpanned Len Miller, who resides beside glittering 
Newport Bay. "I don't think I could live here." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say, from here, everything is downhill," chirped his wide-eyed 
wife, Mary Ann. 
</P>
<P>
Faces in the crowd: Stewart Woodard, president of the symphony board; Debra 
Dobb, event chairwoman, and Anne Key, chairwoman of the organization's annual 
Symphony Viennese Ball, set for June 17 at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Straders honored: Judging by the host of heavy hitters who attended Mardan 
Center's salute to Timothy and Susan Strader on Saturday night, the couple is 
something. Bishop Norman F. McFarland of the Catholic Diocese of Orange gave 
the invocation. John Miltner, vice chancellor of UC Irvine, was master of 
ceremonies. Kathryn Thompson, board member of the Performing Arts Center, led a 
tribute. So did Jack Peltason, chancellor of UC Irvine. And so did Gary Hunt, 
executive vice president of the Irvine Co. Not to mention the slew of politicos 
who attended -- among them state Sens. Marian Bergeson and John Seymour. Or the 
event's high-profile co-chairpersons, Tom and Marilyn Nielsen and Larry and 
Carol Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
Mardan chose to honor the Straders for their commitment to local charities, 
including the Performing Arts Center and Santa Margarita High School. 
</P>
<P>
Miltner summed up the Straders' popularity when he said they were "a couple 
that makes our county a better place -- perhaps the best place -- in which to 
live, work and play. And even in which to pray." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the guest list: Renee and Henry Segerstrom; Nora and Charles Hester; Ed 
and Peggy Hoag; Don and Dolly Karcher; Marilyn and Frank Lynch, and the 
Straders' four children: Megan, Patrick, Stephanie and Timothy Jr. Proceeds, 
estimated at $85,000, will go toward scholarships for the individualized 
programs Mardan provides for learning-disabled children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
Setting the record straight: "There's a popular notion," said Dr. Jovita 
Rosenblatt, "that Asian-American students are the brightest, that they have it 
all. Not necessarily. They also have students who fall through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Those students are one reason members of Medellas -- the Medical Dental Legal 
Ladies Society -- came together for a luncheon and fashion show at the Irvine 
Hilton and Towers on Saturday. The benefit marked the kickoff of the group's 
commitment to raise $50,000 to endow a scholarship fund for Asian-Americans at 
UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason was to satisfy the group's need for togetherness, said Rosalind 
Lee, co-founder of the club with Nori Imagawa. "Asian-American professionals 
are spread out all over the county. It's wonderful to have an opportunity to 
come together." 
</P>
<P>
When Lee, wife of Dr. Sammy Lee, helped found the organization in 1967, she got 
together with Imagawa (wife of the late Dr. Richard Imagawa) and thumbed 
through the Yellow Pages. "Any name that looked like it was Asian -- we wrote 
it down!" Lee said, laughing. Letting their fingers do the walking paid off 
with 35 women attending a coffee. "And that was the beginning of Medellas," Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there was coffee brewing in the ballroom Saturday, but there was chicken, 
lemon torte and a fashion extravaganza by Reuben Panis, too. And there were 
remarks by KCBS news anchor Tritia Toyota and UC Irvine Chancellor Jack 
Peltason. "This is a wonderful example of the bonding between the university 
and the Asian-American community," Peltason said. "Scholarships are an 
investment in tomorrow's leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene: Medellas co-presidents Linda Tay and Margaret Nakanishi and 
honorary luncheon co-chairpersons Elizabeth Tierney and Thomas Yuen. 
Rosenblatt, a retired anesthesiologist, and Annie Chu, wife of Dr. Clement Chu, 
were co-chairwomen. Proceeds from the $50-per-person event were estimated at 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
A caper by any other name: Ask Patrick Dudley to define "caper" and the 
definition rolls trippingly off his tongue: "The bud of a shrub grown in the 
Mediterranean." 
</P>
<P>
The pickled version of that bud finds its way into dishes at Dudley and Jules 
Marine's new Dana Point restaurant. The name? Capers, of course. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Dudley was quick to point out, the word "means fun times, too." 
</P>
<P>
Both kinds of capers were on the menu for members of Red Ribbon 100 last 
Thursday when they kicked up their heels at the eatery's grand opening bash, 
netting about $3,000 for the local chapter of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the entire menu -- from buttery lobster tail to juicy prime rib 
and just about everything divine in between -- was up for sampling. 
</P>
<P>
And members of Red Ribbon, a close-knit women's advisory council to the local 
Red Cross chapter, had plenty to chat about. "We started out in an advisory 
capacity," said Karen Reed, a charter member of the group. "And we've decided 
to add fund-raising." The council was created to help the local chapter get 
from a "blood-and-bandages image," Reed said, to an image more acceptable to 
society. (It's working. The 100-strong group has 14 women on its waiting list 
and a roster that boasts some of society's creme de la creme: Dolly Karcher, 
Virginia Knott Bender and Bernice Hird, to name a few.) 
</P>
<P>
Priscilla Selman was event co-chairwoman. Also capering it up: Robert Beck, a 
member of the Red Cross board; Barbara Johnson, Red Ribbon president, and Don 
Karcher, board chairman-elect of the local chapter.

ASK THE VET: RESPIRATORY AILMENTS ARE COMMON IN CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I am concerned about my 4-year-old Siamese cat who has recently started to 
wheeze and occasionally sneeze. She doesn't have a runny nose or runny eyes and 
has a great appetite. She will walk around the house and just act like she has 
a very bad chest cold. At first, I thought she was purring differently but now 
it occurs more frequently. Could she be having a cold? Why would she seem sick 
sometimes and act healthy the rest of the time? 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Zamora, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A: Respiratory ailments are very common in cats and can have a variety of 
causes. Most are caused by viruses and develop into signs similar to our colds: 
runny eyes and nose, coughing, fever, and occasional lack of appetite. Cats are 
also prone to develop allergic bronchial disease which could be due to antigens 
picked up from grooming or even fighting with other cats. Severe chest diseases 
such as pneumonia and pleural effusion can occur and are very serious. Tumors 
and fungal infections do occur and may cause congested-like signs in cats. You 
should definitely have your cat examined by your veterinarian. An X-ray will be 
necessary to look for the condition of the lungs, major airways and heart. It 
may be necessary to get a blood sample to determine if an infection is 
occurring. Your cat should also be current on vaccinations. Appropriate 
medication will be started and may need to be continued for several weeks. In 
some cases, a recheck X-ray may be necessary to follow progress. Your cat may 
be only having a mild allergic bronchitis but it is important to have her 
checked out. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have three parakeets which are all kept in the same cage. One of the 
females has developed some diarrhea but still seems to act normally. They are 
not exposed to any chemical cleaners and I make sure that their food is as 
fresh and clean as possible. Should I separate this one bird from the others? 
What kind of medication should I be giving her to stop the diarrhea? Is there 
anything else I should do for her? 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Railsman, Orange 
</P>
<P>
A: Diarrhea in very small birds can become serious if left untreated. It can be 
caused by anything from parasites to digestive problems and can be difficult to 
treat. With birds, diarrhea must be distinguished from urinary disease which 
also may cause fluid droppings that will appear to be diarrhea. I recommend 
that you have your bird checked by your veterinarian. Bring several samples of 
the droppings and a sample of the food that you use. It may be wise to separate 
the birds until you get a diagnosis. Lab tests such as fecal samples and blood 
tests may be necessary to help with the diagnosis and treatment of your bird.

LIFE ON WHEELS: DRIVERS INSIST THAT THE BEST DEFENSE IS A DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Cominolo isn't paranoid, exactly. 
</P>
<P>
He just has this feeling that someone's out to get him. Nobody in particular; 
just every other driver on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"They're out to hit you," he says matter-of-factly. He doesn't mean they will 
bash you intentionally, of course. "But we do have some, well, inadequate 
drivers out there," he says. "You have to expect the worst." 
</P>
<P>
If you thought defensive driving meant simply watching out for the other guy, 
think again. Cominolo and his six co-workers at Pacific Bell's Operational 
Support Group in Orange have taken the common-sense practice to a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
They don't make U-turns, period. And they turn left only when there is no 
alternative. Whenever possible, they'll go around the block and make 3 right 
turns to avoid a left. They don't just stop at crosswalks; they stop 3 feet 
behind the line. 
</P>
<P>
All that caution has paid off. Last month, Cominolo and fellow communications 
technicians Dick Jorgensen, Steve Kilmer, Ron Mansfield, Darla Pogwizd, Laura 
Robison and Dan Spellings were honored for making it through 8 years and 2 
million miles without an accident. And their personal driving records are just 
as clean, says Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen. 
</P>
<P>
Let's put those numbers in perspective. Assuming they were car-pooling, the 
group could have circled the Earth more than 80 times, or made 4.2 round trips 
to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it's got to be skill," Cominolo says. "But a lot of it's got to be 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
That spotless record only makes the team more cautious, Cominolo says. "We're 
due for an accident," he says. "The longer we go, the more nervous we get. It's 
going to happen eventually." 
</P>
<P>
By now, there's also a certain amount of peer pressure. "Nobody wants to be the 
one to mess it up for all of us," he says. "There would be a lot of ribbing -- 
good-natured, but still. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Orange County, the seven technicians drive to offices as far 
away as Furnace Creek, near Death Valley, and the Arizona border to maintain 
computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Like any Pacific Bell employee who drives a company car, the technicians went 
through a company defensive-driving course before they were allowed on the 
road. For Cominolo, that was in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big change for me," he says. "A lot of the stuff at first I thought 
was petty -- always wear your seat belt, avoid following too closely. Those 
were the days when if you didn't have your seat belt on and the boss caught 
you, you'd go home for the rest of the day. So once or twice and you learn. Now 
it's just second nature." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their formal training, the technicians have come up with their 
own unofficial guidelines over the years. They've learned to be extra, extra 
watchful near Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and in Newport Beach, Cominolo 
says, where there are more tourists and young drivers than elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
They can't guarantee you'll have the same results, of course, but the 
technicians and Pacific Bell are happy to share some of their defensive driving 
tips. 
</P>
<P>
* It's important to adopt the right attitude. "Be calm and positive," Bonniksen 
says. "The right attitude overcomes maintenance problems, road hazards and bad 
weather conditions." Cominolo puts it another way. "When you're stuck in 
traffic, there's not a whole lot you can do about it, so you might as well 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
* Before driving, check your turn signals, headlights, brakes, tire inflation 
and mirror adjustments. You don't necessarily have to get out the pressure 
gauge every time, but it doesn't hurt to at least glance at the tires. 
</P>
<P>
* Walk around your car before pulling away, and look for children, animals or 
other cars parked around your vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
* Back into parking spaces (where it is not prohibited) and pull out forward. 
That way, you'll always know what's in back of you and what's in front. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't make U-turns, and avoid left-hand turns. Cominolo says that was a hard 
rule to get used to, but now it doesn't bother him. To him, the extra few 
minutes it takes to go around the block are worth the added safety. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep your wheels straight before making a turn. That way if you're hit from 
behind, your car will be pushed straight and not into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to "read" the cars around you. Exhaust from a parked car could mean the 
driver is about to pull into traffic. If a parked car is occupied, the doors 
may open suddenly. And look at the wheels of oncoming cars -- if they are 
turned, the driver may be about to pull in front of you. 
</P>
<P>
* Watch for out-of-state license plates, especially near tourist attractions. 
The driver may be lost or unfamiliar with the area. 
</P>
<P>
* On the freeway as well as on surface streets, find the lane of least conflict 
and try to stay there. That's usually the center lane. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure you can see three blocks ahead in city traffic, one-quarter mile on 
the freeway. If you're behind a truck or van that blocks your vision, go around 
it -- carefully. 
</P>
<P>
* Create a space cushion. The official Pacific Bell rule is to find a 
stationary marker somewhere ahead on the street or freeway. When the back 
wheels of the car in front of you meet the marker, start counting. It should 
take the front wheels of your car 4 seconds to reach the marker. 
</P>
<P>
Cominolo admits he doesn't follow this rule exactly. Instead, he tries to leave 
a car length in front of him for every 10 m.p.h. of speed. "It isn't easy," he 
says. "A lot of times you'll do that and three cars will pull in front of you." 
When that happens, he backs off and tries again. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to shake tailgaters. Slow down cautiously to encourage them to pass. If 
that doesn't work, change lanes or pull over cautiously and let them pass. 
</P>
<P>
* When you stop behind a car, make sure you are far enough behind to see its 
tires touching the pavement. It's the space cushion idea again: If the car 
ahead stalls, you will have room to move around it safely. If you're hit from 
behind, you may avoid a chain-reaction collision. 
</P>
<P>
* At crosswalks, leave extra room by stopping where you can see the nearest 
white line. That way you'll be less likely to hit a pedestrian if you're hit 
from behind. 
</P>
<P>
* Give yourself time. Check weather and road conditions before you start 
driving, and allow more commuting time if necessary. Learn alternate routes and 
use them if your primary route has major problems. If you do happen to be late, 
don't get antsy in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Always signal, and do so far enough ahead that other drivers have time to 
react. 
</P>
<P>
* Signal or not, don't make sudden lane changes, even if it means missing your 
exit. You can always go back. 
</P>
<P>
* Use your seat belt, and make sure everyone else in your car does the same. 
</P>
<P>
* Set your emergency brake whenever you park the car. 
</P>
<P>
* On the freeway, try not to drive right next to another car. "If somebody on 
your right or left does something dumb, you want a lane to move into," Cominolo 
says. 
</P>
<P>
* If you're on the right behind someone and you can't see their rear-view 
mirror, that means you're in their blind spot. Move forward or back just a 
little so you can be seen. 
</P>
<P>
* Watch out for motorcycles; they may slip in between lanes. 
</P>
<P>

There's much to look forward to as you cross the half-century mark and advance 
into your 50s and beyond. That's evident in the reflections of the following 
50-plussers -- all people who are thoroughly enjoying this time in their lives. 
They are not preoccupied with looking young, but emanate a youthful -- better 
yet, ageless -- quality, because they are active, productive, optimistic about 
the future and eager to take on challenges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Optimism is extremely important. It has carried me a long way' 
</P>
<P>
"Each decade of my life has brought me great excitement, and each has been 
better than the last. I am a very high-energy person, and I am an eternal 
optimist. That optimism is extremely important. It has carried me a long way. I 
have used societal barriers as challenges to be overcome, proving to myself and 
the world that I am a very special person with a lot of perseverance. I don't 
think much about the future because there are too many things to be done today. 
I believe as long as you stay active you can somehow transcend biological aging 
-- particularly if you keep your mind active. But physical activity is 
important, too, which is why I make room in my schedule for walking and playing 
tennis."

<P>
'I'm delighted at the amount of energy I have' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very good as I reach 60. My health is good. I'm careful about what I 
eat. I exercise, I don't use tobacco and I'm moderate in my consumption of 
alcohol. I love my work. I don't want to give it up because I enjoy it so much, 
and I still have a fair bit to contribute to my profession. I hope I have quite 
a few more productive years ahead. I'm delighted at the amount of energy I 
have. I walk three to six miles a day. To have that exercise tolerance at this 
time in my life is most gratifying." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Whatever the road ahead is, I'm grateful for each day as it comes along' 
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful my 54 years of working as a script supervisor in the film 
industry have afforded me a good pension and many other benefits. So I don't 
have to work anymore and I'm free of certain financial worries, although I'm 
living on a fixed income. I have my wits about me, I tint my hair, I enjoy 
dancing and traveling. I don't think too much about tomorrow. Day to day is 
important to me -- staying healthy, listening to good music, enjoying good 
conversation with my husband, reading good books, enjoying good friends. 
Whatever the road ahead is -- whether it's one week or 10 years -- I'm grateful 
for each day as it comes along. I'm glad to be alive. I expect it to be a good 
life for the rest of the journey."

'I came to play, not to watch' 
</P>
<P>
"Over 50 was good; over 60 is even better. At this age I appreciate all that 
life has to offer, with no pressure to prove myself -- to myself or anyone 
else. I feel as good as I've ever felt. I don't have the same endurance that I 
had when I was younger, but that is compensated for by my ability to pace 
myself -- and professionally to do things faster and more efficiently than I 
did 20 years ago. I work more than I ever have, but I play hard, too. I work at 
staying physically fit. I think better when I'm in shape. I decided early in 
life that I wouldn't become a crotchety, negative-thinking older person. It's 
so easy to dwell on the past. I try not to do that. I hope I can use the past 
as a realm of experience to give me an advantage in dealing with the future, 
while recognizing that the rule of life is that of change. One of the great 
tragedies is when people decide because they're at a certain age that it's no 
longer useful or enriching to study or think or do things. I came to play, not 
to watch."

'I have a keenness of appreciation I've never experienced before' 
</P>
<P>
"I've just recovered from a brush with cancer, so I find myself overwhelmingly 
joyful for every day. I have a keenness of appreciation I've never experienced 
before. I used to think I was indestructible -- it's a real surprise when you 
find out you're not. What matters most to me? Good health, my family, good 
friends, my environmental writing and good times. After spending 25 years 
fighting for an improved environment in Southern California, I'm thinking 
seriously about moving up to coastal Northern California -- to enjoy some of 
what remains of California's splendor. The question is: How does one go about 
making a new life on one's own at age 59? It's hard to leave friends with whom 
you've shared so much. But I expect to enjoy the challenge and the change."

'I've enjoyed all the years I've accumulated' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't find 50 a trauma, nor do I find 65 any limit on my capacities. I've 
enjoyed all the years I've accumulated so far. I have good health, thank God, 
and a good business and lots of energy. I've thought about retirement but not 
with enough seriousness to take advantage of it, though I am building a retreat 
in Colorado that may end up being a retirement home. I have my own 
home-building business, so retirement isn't being imposed upon me. I enjoy my 
work very much. My business is stressful, but I seem to thrive on that stress."

'I have less of a need to be outstanding and more of a capacity to enjoy life 
as it is' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more comfortable with myself than I have ever before. I enjoy most of 
all my work with people. All of my adult life I have built up an instrument 
which is my professional means of helping people as a psychiatrist and 
psychoanalyst. This instrument appears to be becoming ever sharper, and it's a 
great source of gratification for me. I enjoy people far more than I ever did 
before, because I have been able to let down old barriers within myself and can 
more easily identify with others while at the same time appreciating their 
uniqueness. I have less of a need to be outstanding at anything and more of a 
capacity to enjoy life as it is. I feel fortunate that my health is good, and I 
don't feel any noticeable decline. I attribute that to a continued fascination 
with my work, which almost approaches play in its gratification, and on the 
other hand the ability to put aside my work and engage in other activities such 
as walking, writing and boating." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
'My friends tell me it's time for me to relax, but . . . I feel there's a lot 
to be done' 
</P>
<P>
"My health is fine, thank God -- I'm thin, but very strong, and I'm grateful 
for that. I think keeping busy is what keeps me healthy. My friends tell me 
it's time for me to relax, but I'm still very idealistic, and I feel there's a 
lot to be done. With technology advancing so fast, the world is getting to be 
smaller every day, and I believe we have to learn to think globally and to feel 
comfortable with cultures that are different from our own. When you meet people 
from different cultures, your life can't help but be enriched. I love going to 
art exhibits, symphony concerts and plays and enjoying a good meal with good 
wine. And being with people of different ethnic groups whom I have come to love 
and respect. It seems there is never enough time, but I plan to keep working on 
improving cross-cultural understanding."

LATINO CAUCUS GOES AFTER AT-LARGE ELECTION SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Latinos making up about one-quarter of California's population, it has 
become a sore point for Assemblyman Peter Chacon that so few Latinos have 
stepped into the ranks of political power. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, a San Diego Democrat who chairs the Legislature's Hispanic Caucus, has 
gathered statistics showing that Latinos occupy only 6.5% of city council seats 
and 6% of seats on school boards statewide. 
</P>
<P>
"This is hurting our community," Chacon declared recently while unveiling a 
package of 17 bills, much of it focused on bolstering Latino political strength 
on the local level. "Hispanics are terribly under-represented in local 
government, on city councils and on school boards. . . . So resources are 
allocated to the majority community that dominates local government." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the legislative package -- the first that has drawn the 
united support of the seven-member caucus -- are bills that seek to do away 
with the at-large election system that Latino leaders believe is largely 
responsible for diluting minority political power. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 of the state's 450 cities still use the at-large system despite 
calls for change. 
</P>
<P>
While attempts to overturn the at-large system have largely met with failure, 
the Hispanic Caucus decided to move on the issue this year because of a recent 
decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The July ruling, which was 
upheld recently by the U.S. Supreme Court, struck down the at-large system used 
by the city of Watsonville, where nearly half the residents are Latino but no 
Latino has won election for nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
In its written decision, the federal appeals court held that Latinos had been 
the victims of "ubiquitous" discrimination and need not prove current 
discriminatory practices to challenge at-large, citywide elections. 
</P>
<P>
The bills in the caucus package seek to translate the court ruling into 
practice by ordering an end to at-large elections in school districts with 
enrollments over 20,000, requiring elections by district to the Los Angeles 
Community College Board of Trustees and clarifying the authority of cities to 
adopt district election laws without submitting them to voters. 
</P>
<P>
The measures face political problems, in part because of concern among 
Republicans that giving more political power to Latinos will translate into 
more votes for Democratic candidates. Latino voters traditionally register as 
Democrats. Moreover, the measures would upset the system that brought the 
current crop of political leaders to power, Democrats as well as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 120 members of the Assembly and Senate, only seven are Latinos. The fact 
that this is the first time the small caucus has been able to agree on a 
legislative agenda illustrates another difficulty -- a lack of unity that has 
diffused Latino power at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent Capitol press conference to show new Latino solidarity, two 
caucus members, Sens. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) and Joseph B. Montoya 
(D-Whittier), failed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), author of the community 
college bill, said the caucus decided to target the Los Angeles Community 
College District because of Los Angeles' large Latino population and the fact 
that only one of the district's seven board members is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is roughly parallel to the Watsonville case," said Deborah 
Ortiz, who is handling the bill for Polanco. If the bill passes, Ortiz said, 
she foresees the likelihood that at least two Latino seats will be created on 
the district's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
The bill aimed at allowing cities to move toward district elections without a 
public vote is likely to draw strong opposition. There is nothing in current 
law to prevent cities from taking such action. But Chacon, the bill's author, 
said he wanted to clarify the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino lawmakers hope to sell their legislative program, not so much by 
talking about the problems created in the Latino community, but by stressing 
the problems that might be created for the rest of the population if many 
Latinos remain poor, uneducated and without political representation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to focus on the fact the demographics are changing in California 
and the future of this population is directly tied to the future of the state," 
said Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Hispanic Caucus are Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and 
Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles.)

</P>
<P>
THE INSURANCE GAP; 
</P>
<P>
THE QUESTION FOR MANY: SHOULD I BUY OR RETAIN SUPPLEMENTAL MEDICARE COVERAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Sing is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are among the nation's 32 million citizens eligible for Medicare, you 
can rest easier these days. Congress has expanded Medicare's coverage, starting 
this year, to better protect you and other beneficiaries from financial ruin 
due to catastrophic hospital, doctor and prescription drug bills. 
</P>
<P>
But some notable gaps in Medicare coverage remain. Thus, the question for many 
seniors is: Should I buy or retain supplemental insurance to cover these gaps? 
</P>
<P>
Your answer may well be yes, at least for this year. But, unfortunately, such 
insurance -- generally considered to have been overpriced even before this year 
-- has become even less of a good buy. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare supplement insurance -- known as Medigap -- covers less now that 
Medicare covers more. Despite this reduced coverage, Medigap premiums are 
rising this year by as much as 30% to 40%, with many plans priced between $400 
to $800 a year. 
</P>
<P>
With further enhancements in Medicare coverage to begin in 1990, Medigap 
policies may become even less valuable next year. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, most people should probably continue to buy it and eat the price 
increase, with the thought of dropping it next year if prices don't come down 
significantly," says J. Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance 
Consumer Organization, a nonprofit group in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors also face another problem with Medigap coverage. Unscrupulous insurance 
companies and agents continue to use questionable -- and in some cases illegal 
-- sales tactics to hawk these policies to unwary people who may already be 
covered. As a result, many seniors are over-insured, with some having as many 
as five overlapping policies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a complicated purchase," says Robin Talbert, senior program 
specialist in the consumer affairs division of the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons. "It's so easy to be misled or to misunderstand what information is 
provided to you," 
</P>
<P>
To get the best value and avoid being ripped off, you will need to be diligent 
in determining your true insurance needs, and then shop carefully. 
</P>
<P>
First, become more familiar with what Medicare covers. Under its new 
comprehensive coverage, for example, you will be covered for unlimited days of 
reasonable and necessary hospital care, after you pay a single annual hospital 
deductible of $560. Previously, Medicare coverage for hospital stays was phased 
out after the first 60 days a year and terminated completely after 150 days. 
</P>
<P>
Coverages will expand even more in 1990 and 1991. Starting in 1990, for 
example, Medicare will cover all Medicare-approved expenses (such as 
physician's services, inpatient and outpatient medical services and supplies, 
physical and speech therapy, and ambulance charges) once you have paid $1,370 a 
year to cover a $75 annual deductible and a 20% co-payment. 
</P>
<P>
And beginning in 1991, Medicare will cover all approved prescription drug 
charges, after you pay a $600 annual deductible. 
</P>
<P>
This expanded coverage, however, is not free. Premiums are higher. And if you 
are eligible for Medicare, you will be assessed a federal income tax surcharge 
if you pay at least $150 in federal income tax, starting with 1989 returns. 
That surcharge will be $22.50 for each $150 of your tax liability, up to a 
limit of $800 per person, for taxes you pay on 1989 income. Those amounts will 
rise in subsequent tax years. (Some members of Congress have proposed reducing 
the surtax, but the outcome of that effort remains uncertain.) 
</P>
<P>
Covering Medicare's remaining deductibles and co-payments is where many Medigap 
policies try to fit in. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary standards established by the National Assn. of Insurance 
Commissioners require that any Medicare supplement policy must provide a 
minimal level of benefits at a reasonable cost. The policies also must be easy 
to understand and not duplicate Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Under those standards, for example, Medigap policies must cover all or none of 
the $560 annual Medicare hospital deductible -- nothing in between. Medigap 
policies also must cover the $25.50 per day you must pay under Medicare for the 
first eight days in a skilled nursing facility. (Most nursing homes in 
California are skilled nursing facilities, but most elsewhere in the country 
are not. Skilled nursing facilities primarily furnish skilled nursing and 
rehabilitative services and may be part of a hospital or a separate facility.) 
</P>
<P>
Some Medigap policies may include other benefits not covered by Medicare, such 
as payment for hospitalization in a private room. They may also pay for charges 
above payment levels approved by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are some areas that neither Medicare nor Medigap covers. One 
such area is long-term nursing home care. For that you may need separate, 
long-term care insurance, although it, too, is regarded by many consumer 
advocates as a poor buy because of high premiums and limited coverages. 
</P>
<P>
(One source of more information on long-term care policies is the state 
Insurance Department's free publication, "Long-Term Care Insurance: A 
Consumer's Guide for Californians." Get it by calling the department's consumer 
hot line at (800) 233-9045.) 
</P>
<P>
Given the limitations and high costs of Medigap policies, do you really need 
one? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very personal decision," based on your own financial and physical 
circumstances, says Jerry Whitfield, the state Insurance Department's special 
deputy commissioner for problems of the aging. 
</P>
<P>
You generally won't need it if you are low enough in income to qualify for 
Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California). Conversely, you won't need it if you 
are wealthy enough to pay for any Medicare deductibles or other gaps without 
hardship. 
</P>
<P>
You also won't need Medigap if you are already covered in your current or 
former employer's health plan. Some employers may be willing to convert your 
insurance into a Medigap policy once you hit age 65. 
</P>
<P>
And you may not need Medigap if you are enrolled in a solvent health 
maintenance organization or other prepaid health plan. 
</P>
<P>
But you might want Medigap if you see doctors who don't accept Medicare or who 
charge above the rates Medicare is willing to pay. You also might want a 
supplemental policy if you expect to need major surgery or other expensive 
medical procedure during the year or if you simply want greater peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
Another way of getting Medigap coverage is by enrolling in a solvent health 
maintenance organization or other prepaid health plan. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, however, the need for Medigap shrinks considerably if your doctors 
accept Medicare rates. That is because you will only need to pay the $560 
annual deductible for hospitalization and no more than $1,370 for doctor's 
bills and other medical expenses. That makes an insurance policy costing $500 
or so look highly expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense to pay $500 to insure against a $2,000 potential risk," 
contends James P. Firman, president of the United Seniors Health Cooperative, a 
regional nonprofit consumer organization based in Washington. "By next year 
they (Medigap policies) will be clearly not worth the money unless prices go 
down dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
However, because California medical costs tend to be higher than the rest of 
the nation, many doctors in this state do not accept Medicare rates. Therefore, 
you may still need Medigap to pay for the difference. Alternatively, shop for 
doctors who will accept Medicare rates. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips to help you decide whether you need a Medigap policy and 
shop for one: 
</P>
<P>
Become more informed. Several helpful publications are available at little or 
no cost. 
</P>
<P>
More details about expanded Medicare coverage are contained in the 1989 
"Medicare Handbook" from the Health Care Financing Administration, which 
administers the program. Also available from HCFA is a "Guide to Health 
Insurance for People With Medicare." For free copies, check with your local 
Social Security office. 
</P>
<P>
"Preventing Medigap Abuse: A Protection Kit for California Seniors" contains a 
short discussion on Medicare and Medigap, along with forms and checklists and a 
complaint form. For your free copy, call the California Insurance Department's 
consumer hot line at (800) 233-9045. 
</P>
<P>
"Catastrophic Coverage Under Medicare: New Health Care Protection for Older 
Americans" is available free from the American Assn. of Retired Persons. Write: 
AARP Fulfillment, 1909 K St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20049. 
</P>
<P>
"Managing Your Healthcare Finances" explains Medicare, its gaps and what to 
look for in supplemental coverage. It is available for $6.95 from United 
Seniors Health Cooperative, 1334 G St., N.W., No. 500, Washington, D.C. 20005. 
</P>
<P>
In California, take advantage of free counseling. The state-funded Health 
Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program provides free health insurance 
counseling for California seniors. It also provides legal assistance in certain 
circumstances involving claims or payments. For referrals, contact the state 
Insurance Department's consumer hot line at (800) 233-9045. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of replacing existing coverage. Often, new policies will impose 
exclusions or waiting periods for preexisting conditions covered by your 
current policy. Agents trying to sell you new policies may be more interested 
in earning a fat commission than serving your best interests. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a single comprehensive policy. Multiple policies are duplicative and 
costly. Tell the company or agent about your existing coverage, and ask whether 
what they are selling is a duplication. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure the policy meets governmental standards for Medigap policies. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be pressured into a quick decision. Read any policy carefully before you 
buy it. Make sure the policy's premiums, renewal terms and claims procedures 
meet your needs. Check for exclusions and limitations on coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Take advantage of the "free look" provision. By California law you have 30 days 
from the date of receiving a new policy to review it and return it for a full 
refund. 
</P>
<P>
Don't pay cash. Always pay by check, and make the check payable to the 
insurance company, not the agent.

Don't buy any policy that claims to be government-sponsored. State and federal

Beware of policies endorsed by celebrities. Some of the worst policies, 
providing little coverage for the cost, are endorsed by famous individuals,

Look for policies with high "loss ratios." The loss ratio is what percentage of 
your premiums are paid as benefits to policyholders. Regulations require it to 
be at least 75 for group policies and 60 for individual policies. But some 
still are as low as 40 or 50.

celebrations featuring Mexican music, dance, traditional foods and discussions. 
Cinco de Mayo commemorates an important victory in Mexican history and is

</P>
<P>
 On May 5, 1862, a small Mexican force overwhelmed 7,500 French troops in the 
town of Puebla. Although the French went on to dominate Mexico for five years,

CINCO DE MAYO; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENT DANCERS TAP INTO FOLK TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTORIA BARCELONA, Barcelona is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sounds of a Mexican folk song echoes though the school auditorium as the 
stage vibrates with heels stamping the wooden boards. As the dance comes to a 
climax, a dozen or so voices cry out in unison: "Que si!" 
</P>
<P>
The voices belong to Roosevelt High School's folk dancers. In the last weeks, 
the resident folk dance troupe has been rehearsing about three hours a day to 
prepare for public performances the week of Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
A smile, a look that is half timid and coquettish, a casual whisper, and 
Socorro Ruiz, 16, is ready to practice the faldeo (skirt-work) and zapateado 
(Spanish tap dancing) with her partner. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind the scarce lighting and the lack of adequate costumes -- outfits are 
still at the dressmaker's. Ruiz was able to make believe that she's somewhat 
attracted to her dance partner on a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In this type of dance, "(you) have to act as if (you are) open to a 
relationship . . . demonstrate affinity to (your) partner," said Gema Sandoval, 
who founded the first school-based folk dance group at Roosevelt 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for many students, acting as if they are in love with their partner 
seems to be quite an ordeal. And the task apparently requires a knack for 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
Folk dancing "makes you a different person on stage. . . . I can't think the 
way I usually think. I have to act as if I'm really into this guy, even though 
he's ugly or not. I have to act my part," said Elizabeth Gonzalez, a 
17-year-old junior at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Most likely we all feel the same way," Shirley Urquijo, 17, said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Julio Valpuesta, a senior student who teaches the class as a volunteer 
aide, and one of the few participating male dancers: "There's a lot of 
pressure. You forget you're nervous and the performance begins." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sandoval, now the executive director of Plaza de la Raza, the 
Eastside cultural center, "In folk dances throughout the world you have the 
concept of male-female relationships . . . all sorts of levels of relationships 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
In order to depict that theme on stage, some students go back to a specific 
time or place in which women walked with a sway of the hip in order to seduce 
men, and men impressed them with their footwork. 
</P>
<P>
Socorro Ruiz said: "When I dance I identify with my land, Guadalajara, and it 
makes me feel I'm there." 
</P>
<P>
The dances that make up Mexican folklore trace their roots back to different 
areas of Mexico, including Veracruz and Guerrero, Sandoval said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sones de Veracruz," one of the dances in the troupe's repertoire featured the 
week of Cinco de Mayo, is known for its white dresses profuse with French lace, 
and the men's guayaberas, or other loose-fitting shirts. 
</P>
<P>
The European influence is very visible in the way woman from Veracruz dress, 
Sandoval said. Veracruz, a seaport, has been a hub of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The wardrobe for "Sones" would have been incomplete without a trip to Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
A folk dancer since he was 12, Valpuesta crossed the southern border to look 
for the white fans used by the female dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago when the class teacher resigned, Valpuesta and his schoolmate, 
Joel Sandoval, 17, who teaches the advanced folk dance group, stepped in and 
took charge of the two dance groups. 
</P>
<P>
The two youngsters prevented the groups from falling apart, said Amy Niwa, a 
teacher who supervises the dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
According to dean Ramon Salazar, finding a qualified professional folk dance 
teacher with time to devote to the groups and the willingness to do so for $8 
an hour has turned into an impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
Valpuesta and Joel Sandoval said they are willing to fill the vacancy once they 
graduate next year if only to forestall the demise of the oldest folkloric 
troupe in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Valpuesta, who joined the troupe due to an administrative error and then stayed 
"because of the girls" until the dance itself cast a spell on him, said he 
hopes to recruit more male students. 
</P>
<P>
Most boys favor sports and physical education classes over folk dancing, 
according to the troupe leaders. As a result, there's a need for male dancers, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe, made up of about 40 beginning and advanced students, will perform 
at Roosevelt (May 3 and 4), Grant (May 5), and at Cal State Northridge (May 6), 
Valpuesta said.

<P>
As much as we may hate to admit it, things do change along with the decades: -- 
eyesight gets a little blurry, hearing becomes a bit fuzzy, we have trouble 
opening "child-proof" containers and grasping the lid of a jar. Certain daily 
tasks become more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
To the rescue come the manufacturers of diverse household products, some made 
specifically for the elderly or disabled (such as keys with larger, 
easier-to-grasp tops or the New York Times Large-Type Weekly, a news summary 
printed in large type) but most simply designed to make life less of a hassle 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes all it takes is a little imagination to see how everyday items can be 
adapted to particular needs. We've grown used to TV and VCR remote controls, 
but remotes can be used to work most major appliances, lamps, even the 
telephone. Beepers can also be put to work at home, to signal for assistance 
when needed. A great source of useful ideas is "The Gadget Book: Ingenious 
Devices for Easier Living," edited by Dennis LaBuda (Scott, Foresman/American 
Assn. of Retired Persons). It's available for $9.70 (AARP members) and $12.90 
(non-members) from Scott, Foresman/AARP Books, 1865 Miner St., Des Plaines, 
Ill. 60016. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other handy products you'll find locally: 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T offers a Big Button Telephone with extra-large buttons for fast, 
accurate dialing. The company also has a Four Number Dialer that "dials" four 
telephone numbers automatically with a one-touch hand command (good for 
important emergency numbers), and it works with rotary and touch-tone 
telephones and with a selection of telephone-amplilfier equipment designed for 
the hearing-impaired. It's available at AT&amp;T Phone Centers. The AT&amp;T 
Special Needs Center provides telecommunications products and services to 
people with hearing, speech, vision or motion impairments (by voice, 
(800)-233-1222; by TDD/TTY machine, (800)-833-3232). 
</P>
<P>
The Sony Water-Resistant Cordless Telephone, specifically designed for use in 
the bathtub, sauna or pool -- has a water-resistant seal around the phone's 
internal electronics. Available from Hammacher Schlemmer. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies, including Sony, Panasonic and Code-A-Phone make 
telephone-answering machines with large, readable numbers. Available at 
electronics stores. 
</P>
<P>
Sony also makes the My First Sony cassette players, designed for children but 
with large, easy-to-press buttons. Available at electronics stores. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a hearing aid, but the Listenaider II can help you hear a whisper up 
to 25 feet away. It looks like a small radio (it fits into a pocket) with 
headphones, and it works by focusing ambient sounds onto a microphone and 
amplifying them. Available at the Sharper Image. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartus Digital Alarm Clock features an extra-large digital readout and 
sturdy time, hour, minute, alarm and snooze buttons. Available at Adray's. 
</P>
<P>
A talking clock is another answer for people with low vision. When a bar is 
pushed, it tells the time in simulated human speech. For more information, 
contact the American Foundation for the Blind, 15 W. 16th Street, New York 
10011. 
</P>
<P>
Solar-powered calculator pads are easy for stiff fingers to use. Each number 
and function has a 1/2-inch-by- 1/2-inch sensor area; it works under most 
household lighting. Available at Brookstone and at Crate &amp; Barrel. 
</P>
<P>
A Battery-Powered Whistle Light turns room lights on when you whistle. 
Available at Brookstone. 
</P>
<P>
For safety in the kitchen, an electric kettle shuts itself off after the water 
boils. Available at Brookstone. 
</P>
<P>
An all-purpose knife with a large, easy-to-grip handle makes cutting easier. 
Available at Brookstone. 
</P>
<P>
A selection of stainless steel eating and preparation utensils with modified, 
built-up or extended handles can be found at most medical suppliers, such as 
Abbey Medical, Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
There's a choice of magnifiers for those times when the print just isn't big 
enough. Brookstone offers a "page-in-a-glimpse" magnifier that's lightweight 
and flexible and magnifies a whole page of a standard book, and the "no-hands" 
magnifier, an optical grade acrylic lens that hangs from a support cord around 
the neck and rests on the chest, leaving the hands free. Hands-Free Personal 
Headlights from Hammacher Schlemmer are battery-powered lighted eyeframes that 
focus two beams of light onto a work area. They fit comfortably over normal 
eyeglass frames. The Thermostat Magnifier snaps over a round Honeywell 
thermostat for sharp settings, and the See-Through Window Thermometer, with its 
large Fahrenheit numbers, needs no adhesive or hardware to attach to the 
outside of a window. Both available at Brookstone. 
</P>
<P>
The battery-powered Smallest Blood Pressure Monitor uses a pressure-sensing 
finger cuff to read blood pressure and pulse rate in less than 30 seconds. 
Rates are displayed alternately on a 1 3/4-inch LCD readout. Available at 
Hammacher Schlemmer. 
</P>
<P>
Most frequently selected for use in hospitals, the Vertical Bathtub Safety Rail 
mounts perpendicularly on any tub wall to make getting in and out of the 
bathtub easy. Available at Hammacher Schlemmer. 
</P>
<P>
The Electric Timer Pillbox can be set to remind you when it's time to take your 
next pill. The white slide box holds the pills; a digital readout displays the 
time and beeps for a full minute at the proper time. Available at Brookstone. 
</P>
<P>
There's no need to give up gardening with the Rolling Gardener's Seat. It 
features 8-inch diameter tires that roll easily over wet and cultivated soil 
without bogging down, a comfortable padded seat and storage caddy for gardening 
tools. Available at Hammacher Schlemmer. 
</P>
<P>
Smith &amp; Hawken offer an excellent selection of tools that make gardening 
easier. Among them: lawn shears with a horizontal blade, and a "back saver" 
rake, both with long handles so that work can be done while standing up; two 
"kneeler" stools, one metal, one of lightweight polyethylene, that can be used 
either as seats or for kneeling on; long-handled forks and trowels. Available 
from the Smith &amp; Hawken catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
For computer buffs who'd like to have larger type displayed on the screen, Don 
Selwyn (9 Decker Road, Butler N.J. 07405) makes a program (4K memory needed) 
that allows the user to type in both large and regular type sizes. Also check 
local computer stores for similar programs.

<P>
Retirement -- some long for it, some detest the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 By choice or not, though, most older workers end up retiring; only 31% of Los 
Angeles-area residents over 55 continue to work. Nationally, only 10% keep 
working past age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 What far fewer do is plan for retirement. Studies have found that 60% to 70% 
of older people make no specific preparation for their retirement years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of retirees depend entirely on Social Security -- a system 
never designed to offer a complete retirement income -- and the generosity of 
friends and relatives to support them in their old age. Only 15% of 
Californians ages 65 to 74 can count on the triad of income sources that 
financial planners term crucial to a comfortable retirement: a pension, Social 
Security and income-generating personal assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, many older Americans worry about money. A survey by 
the American Assn. of Retired Persons found that "having enough money" is the 
biggest concern of people over 40 when they thought about retirement. More than 
60% of people still working past age 63 told AARP that they did so because they 
"need the money." 
</P>
<P>
 The most affluent -- including those who planned best -- are the happiest with 
retirement. Fully 40% of retirees, the AARP survey found, would rather be 
working. Income was the determining factor: Those with the least money were 
most disillusioned with retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Visits with four Southland families suggest that those statistics are valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and Aggie Matthews of Anaheim have had to keep working into their late 
60s -- with no relief in sight -- because a business downturn upset their 
sketchy hopes for retirement. James and Alexandra Koontz of Palos Verdes have 
taken the steps they expect will guarantee a secure retirement when Jim stops 
working in the next few years. Gerard Wright of Simi Valley could have retired 
comfortably at 65, but his wife Mary's catastrophic illness instead has forced 
him to be looking for work at 71. Finally, William and Margaret Hall of 
Woodland Hills are living the good life; a lifetime of careful planning and 
good health, along with a generous pension, make these truly their golden 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Planning ahead? Don't talk to Dennis and Aggie Matthews about planning ahead. 
</P>
<P>
He worked 22 years for an automatic-controls company, rising to become a sales 
manager and expecting to stay till he retired. But he quit in 1970 to start his 
own business as a manufacturers representative when it became clear that the 
firm was becoming uncompetitive in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Aggie Matthews invested her time and energy in civic affairs in Inglewood, not 
too far north of her childhood home in Wilmington, where her large Lebanese 
immigrant family owned a thriving grocery that supported more than one 
household. But after years of working on interracial-relations committees, she 
decided that the family had to leave Inglewood when gang members beat up their 
13-year-old son, Curtis, on his way home from school. 
</P>
<P>
"He came home looking like hamburger," the gregarious, gray-haired woman 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Into Dennis' new business went all their money: his pension payment from his 
old employer, their savings, most of the proceeds from selling the Inglewood 
house, an inheritance from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Dennis, a University of Washington-trained engineer, was a 
talented salesman, and D. A. Matthews Associates prospered. In the third year, 
it turned a profit. A few years later, their income was in six figures. Aggie 
and Dennis paid for three of their four children to attend college. Life in 
Anaheim, in the big stucco tract house north of Disneyland, was cozy. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we were investing our money into the business itself," Aggie 
explained. "At one point, we expected it would begin to (show a) return, so we 
could put our money away." 
</P>
<P>
That expectation abruptly crumbled in 1980. The control manufacturer whose line 
constituted 75% of Dennis' business dropped D. A. Matthews as its distributor. 
A lawsuit followed, and a settlement, but the Matthewses' finances were 
devastated. Dennis lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions. He 
scrambled to find new product lines to support the firm's overhead. Aggie had 
to go to work as an office temporary. Their youngest child, Marian, had to 
depend on scholarships to finish college. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years later, the Matthewses, both 67 years old, are paying off loans they 
took out to salvage the business. "We're gradually nipping at them and getting 
them paid," says Dennis, a gentle, balding man with silver glasses and a 
white-silver mustache. Aggie still is working as a temp. And Dennis works more 
than 40 hours a week from an office at home, trying to rebuild his firm. "The 
company has not built back up to where it was," he says, "and I don't think it 
will." Their income now is about $30,000 per year. Neither harbors any thoughts 
of retirement; they can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
None of which is to suggest that the Matthews look back with regret. "There's 
nothing in the world that we need," Aggie says. "We have always pulled 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, they say, the lesson of their life is that planning is for nought. 
Aggie laughs at the notion. And one other lesson: Be cautious, she says over 
coffee and cookies, about "putting all your eggs in one basket." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Wright has his retirement all figured out. 
</P>
<P>
"I should get about $130,000 for the house -- I could keep most of that," the 
71-year-old electromechanical design engineer says. "(With) Social Security and 
another $10,000 or $12,000 from the house money, we'd be fine." 
</P>
<P>
But Wright won't be retiring anytime soon. In fact, he's spending his days now 
at Forty Plus, the job-search agency in Los Angeles, looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his peers, Wright's financial plans for old age have been 
decimated by illness. Four years ago his wife, Mary -- after years of 
deteriorating health -- suffered a series of small strokes that left her 
bedridden. It didn't take long in a nursing home before their private health 
insurance and Medicare benefits ran out. That left Wright with a $2,000 bill to 
pay every month from a monthly net income of $3,000. "I'm going to lose the 
house," he remembered thinking. "I can't pay off the cars, can't pay for the 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
Friends advised the Wrights to take steps to qualify for Medi-Cal -- advice 
they took. The rules said they could keep the house and could each have a car 
(even though Mary cannot drive). But cash was out; each could retain only 
nominal liquid assets. "That meant spend down," Wright says. 
</P>
<P>
It was early 1987, and Wright had just been laid off after 11 years at Reynolds 
Industries in Los Angeles. So he had the $18,000 lump sum from Reynolds' 
pension plan to dispose of. He paid off some old second mortgages and the note 
on his car. He and his wife were each left with $1,700. But now Mary's medical 
expenses would be borne by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Between a monthly Social Security check and the income from renting out two 
bedrooms of his Simi Valley house, Wright says, he is barely getting by. "I 
eat. I buy shoes and socks and such as I need them," he says. "But if my car 
goes on the fritz, I'm going to be in a real bind." 
</P>
<P>
So he is trying to find a job. He spends three days a week at Forty Plus, 
getting training in the best ways to market himself, learning new ways to find 
job leads, sending out resumes. Is his age an obstacle? "I don't see how it 
could be anything but," Wright says. 
</P>
<P>
Saving money early on might have made a difference, Wright says, "but we were 
never far enough ahead to do any." Another illness decades ago -- Mary was very 
sick after their second child's birth -- wiped out the family's savings. 
</P>
<P>
"Being hit twice in one lifetime," he says, "is not par for the course." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Koontz was only 8 years old when his father died, but he still has the 
check that the railroad retirement fund sent. It's for $1.85. 
</P>
<P>
"That really was a strong message," says Koontz, now a 62-year-old 
administrator for missile launch operations at the Aerospace Corp. in El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The message? "Be conscious of your retirement requirements and needs," he says. 
"It has to be part of each individual's conscious concern almost from the time 
they're conscious. And it has to be done with some independent spirit. One 
cannot feel and be comforted that their needs will be taken care of, either by 
government or their employer or their family." 
</P>
<P>
Jim and Sandy Koontz have taken that message and made it the first principle in 
their financial lives. "Frugal" by their own description -- careful marketers, 
inclined to drive an extra block to save a few cents a gallon on gasoline, 
infrequent diners out -- they have invested their savings in California real 
estate in anticipation of Jim's eventual retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, their purchases were driven by life-style preferences. A dozen years 
ago, they sold their home in Inglewood -- pulling out some equity and leaving 
pool and garden upkeep behind -- and bought a condominium atop a hillside in 
Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, they built a tile-roofed stucco house in Escondido, 
thinking that they someday would retire to San Diego's sleepy North County. But 
frantic development in the area stripped it of appeal, and for six years the 
Koontzes have had the house rented out while its value has soared. 
</P>
<P>
Soured on Escondido, they next built a house in Kernville, on the shores of 
Lake Isabella. Fans of fishing and entertaining, they figured that the rural 
outpost would be an ideal retirement setting. 
</P>
<P>
But lately, the Koontzes have leaned toward using the Palos Verdes condo, 
closer to medical facilities and cultural amenities, as their retirement base. 
Both now in good health, they suppose that someday they will sell the other 
houses to pay the costs of caring for themselves in the late stages of life. 
</P>
<P>
"The company retirement plan and Social Security would be very, very 
acceptable," Jim explains. "But our attitude is we're looking to our own 
resources, our independent investments, to satisfy our principal needs." 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to be caught by surprise, the Koontzes' investing has been anything 
but casual: "A studied project," Jim calls it. "A very studied project," Sandy 
corrects. Jim gives a lot of the credit to the Aerospace Corp. From age 55 on, 
the company offers employees an intensive program of pre-retirement planning -- 
financial readiness programs, instruction in the health effects of aging, 
time-management counseling and more. 
</P>
<P>
If their resulting plan works as intended, the Koontzes -- who as a couple have 
no children, though Sandy has a grown son from her first marriage -- expect to 
reap in retirement just about all they've sowed through decades of work and 
economizing. 
</P>
<P>
Should anything be left at the end, "that's more than gravy," Jim says. "That's 
pure luck. That's bad planning on our part." 
</P>
<P>
Sit with Bill and Peggy Hall for a few minutes and listen as they paint a 
word-picture of their retirement home on the Gulf coast of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing there," says Bill, tan and gravel-voiced at 72. "There's no 
gasoline, no vegetables, no fruit, no groceries." Perhaps 48 American families 
have built homes on the beachfront south of San Felipe, but no more than four 
or five are there at a time, eating fresh fish and clams and shrimp scooped out 
of the warm Gulf waters, crossing the untouched desert in all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The Halls spend perhaps a third of their time in Mexico. They travel to San 
Francisco and Palm Springs. At home in their attractive Woodland Hills 
split-level, Peggy, 69, busies herself with quilting while Bill attends to the 
endless details of an active retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs is the old age most Americans can only hope to enjoy -- the product of a 
working life of loyalty, thrift, foresight and other archaic virtues. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, Bill, like his wife a Minnesota native, went to work for 3M 
as a salesman, a job he stuck with until his retirement 34 years later. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having to raise five children, they always were savers. "We've been 
pretty conservative people," Bill says. "We always figured a certain percentage 
of our income went into savings, whether it was an insurance policy, a 
stock-option plan, or paying off a mortgage on our house." 
</P>
<P>
It helped that Peggy worked, even before working mothers were a common 
phenomenon. While her younger children were still in elementary school, she was 
the school nurse. Later, she worked in the movie industry as a location nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"We were always careful how we spent money," Peggy says. "We had a lot of 
friends that were on the same income level" -- Bill was making more than 
$40,000 annually when he retired 10 years ago -- "and weren't that careful, 
that who spent a lot more of their spendable money for clothes and better 
household furnishings than we had." Even now, the Halls don't buy on credit, 
alert to the damage that high loan and credit card interest rates can do to 
people on a fixed income. 
</P>
<P>
The same care that went into their family budget went into the analysis of 
their financial preparedness for retirement. "We sat down and put it all on 
paper . . . -- our living expenses, everyday and yearly expenses," Bill says. 
"We added it all up to see where we were with what our income was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
The key to their comfort, he says, has been the good deal that 3M offers its 
retirees. 
</P>
<P>
The company has raised his pension several times since he retired. The retiree 
medical plan handles all expenses beyond those covered by Medicare. The Halls 
get dental coverage through 3M at a nominal cost. When 3M employees got an 
extra day off in December to celebrate the company's first $10-billion year in 
sales, Hall and other retirees received a bonus in their pension checks 
equivalent to one extra day's income. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hall knows his advice sounds a bit outdated, and probably comes too late 
for a 40- or 50-year-old who's beginning to think about retirement. But from 
this robust ex-salesman, it sounds convincing: 
</P>
<P>
"Get with a good company, work hard for them and stop leaping from one to 
another. Live within your means. But I think you should have enough pleasure in 
your life. You don't save every little penny." 
</P>

<P>
WELL OFF OLDER PEOPLE (AGE 50 TO 65) ARE VERY ACTIVE TREKKERS. NOT ONLY DO THEY 
HAVE MORE DISPOSABLE MONEY, THEY ALSO HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND IT. AND SPEND IT 
THEY DO.

<P>
It must be downright discouraging to the yuppies that the "woopies" are having 
so much fun -- woopies being Well Off Older People, more singularly known as 
mature travelers. 
</P>
<P>
The travel industry has found these travelers, age 50 to 65, to be a distinct 
market from the true seniors, those 65 and older. The mature travelers are very 
active and not only have more disposable money but they have the time to spend 
it. And spend it they do. 
</P>
<P>
Today's active mature travelers are not fools. They'll gladly accept discounts 
and other benefits offered them to travel mid-week to help fill a resort's 
rooms. That means easier access to golf courses and tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers don't mind spending the bucks on travel, but they do demand 
value. Here are some of the places you might find them in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOMEWHERE EAST OF TIBET 
</P>
<P>
It was appropriate that Frank Capra chose Ojai Valley to serve as the location 
shot for Shangri-la for his 1937 "Lost Horizon." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow you do feel younger in sequestered and sophisticated Ojai. Many 
discover that feeling on the lush fairways of the Ojai Valley Inn and Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Reopened last year after a $36-million renovation and expansion, the 
60-year-old resort now has 218 rooms and suites, modernized and updated but 
maintaining the 1920s version of Mission architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-acre resort offers eight tennis courts (four lighted), two heated 
swimming pools (one is a 60-foot lap pool), a spa, exercise rooms, and cycling, 
jogging and hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
There are four indoor and terrace dining areas, a lounge, room service and such 
appreciated amenities as no-smoking rooms, in-room mini-bars, and terry-cloth 
robes. All this and attentive service has earned the resort a four-star rating 
by Mobil Travel Guides for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Luxury Golf Holiday runs three days, two nights at $298 per person, 
double. It includes two breakfasts, two dinners from a choice of the inn's 
restaurants and menus; unlimited course play, and free driving-range balls. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Tennis Holiday costs $178 per person, double, for a three-day, 
two-night stay, with luxury accommodations, two breakfasts, court fees, and 
free tennis-ball-machine practice time. 
</P>
<P>
There are also fitness holidays, honeymoon and anniversary package plans, and a 
bed-and-breakfast rate. For information and availability, telephone toll-free 
(800) 422-OJAI. Ojai is 73 miles northwest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEE THE SPA BY THE SEA 
</P>
<P>
Down at San Diego's colorful cusp of Coronado, where the venerable Hotel del 
Coronado is now in its 101st year of operation, a French ingenue, the Le 
Meridien, is debuting for its first summer season. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on 16 prime acres of bay-front property, Le Meridien has 300 rooms, 
suites and villas, three swimming pools (one a 75-yard lap pool), six tennis 
courts, a health club and spa, and two excellent restaurants (plus 24-hour room 
service). 
</P>
<P>
All this is situated amid a lush garden ambiance with lagoons, waving palms and 
a low-rise resort setting with a dazzling view of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The resort would appeal to any vacationer, not only the mature traveler. 
Likewise, all would enjoy the free daily introductory clinics in golf, tennis 
and other sports, such as wind surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but for those women who modestly admit to mature years, Southern 
California's newest resort also offers Le Meridien Spa and Clarins Institut de 
Beaute. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a full program of such spa treatments as special baths, herbal 
wraps and massages Le Meridien is the first spa in the United States to offer 
the highly regarded skin-care treatments and products of France's Jacques 
Courtin-Clarins. 
</P>
<P>
(And, this being an equal rights article, mature men also are welcome to all 
spa and beauty treatments.) 
</P>
<P>
With its range of sports and spa activities, Le Meridien has a number of 
special package plans. They start from the two-night Bed and Breakfast at $144 
per person, double, that includes a luxury room and two breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
Spa programs also vary -- from a One Day Rejuvenator with a low-cal spa lunch, 
Swedish massage, Clarins facial, herbal wrap and fitness class for $124 up to a 
four-day, three-night package that offers up to 14 spa services, plus 
accommodations and spa meals for $822 per person, double occupancy. For 
informationtelephone (800) 543-4300. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A MOST CONGENIAL SPOT 
</P>
<P>
You could spend a bit of time in Camelot with a one-night (or longer) package 
at Griswold's Claremont Center, where the Lerner &amp; Loewe musical is 
encamped until mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Long popular with mature travelers, Griswold's attractive Candlelight Pavilion 
features Broadway musicals in a spacious dinner theater; dinner shows are 
offered Wednesday through Sunday, with Saturday and Sunday lunch matinees. 
</P>
<P>
Griswold's has a package that includes a deluxe room, dinner and show for $60 
per person, double occupancy. And there's plenty of time left to enjoy a swim 
in the pool or stroll in the 17-acre landscaped acres. 
</P>
<P>
To work up an appetite for dinner (choice of three entrees), there is browsing 
and shopping in more than 30 specialty shops and galleries in Griswold's Old 
Schoolhouse, part of the hotel-theater-restaurant complex. 
</P>
<P>
There's fine dining at the Indian Hill Restaurant and Lounge or at the 
Smorgasbord Restaurant and scrumptious bakery. For more information and 
reservations telephone (714) 626-1254 or (213) 275-3642. Griswold's is about 32 
miles east of Los Angeles at 555 West Foothill Blvd., Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL 
</P>
<P>
Murrieta Hot Springs Resort and Spa in Temecula has finally shaken off the 
lethargy and suspect reputation that dogged it some years ago. Today the 
47-acre spa resort has great appeal to the mature travelers who can't swing La 
Costa nor open the Golden Door due to budget restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Murrieta has finally joined the mainstream of resort life by adding meat and 
poultry to its menus (as well as wine and beer). Its previous all-vegetarian 
cuisine is still available. 
</P>
<P>
The resort has 14 tennis courts, three swimming pools, access to a fine Robert 
Trent Jones-designed golf course, plus an array of spa, health and beauty 
programs. No new accommodations have been added, but older rooms have been well 
renovated. 
</P>
<P>
A good way to check it out is through one of the several mid-week package 
plans. The three-day, two-night Golf Getaway provides accommodations, 36 holes 
of golf, cart, two breakfasts, two saunas, and 10% off optional spa and beauty 
treatments. It runs $124 per person, double. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a similar midweek tennis program that offers unlimited court time, 
a half-hour lesson, two breakfasts and saunas plus the 10% discounts for $99 
per person, double. 
</P>
<P>
Spa programs range in length from one to seven days and provide a variety of 
options from the resort's 15 health and beauty services. For more information, 
telephone toll-free (800) 458-4393. The resort is about a 90-minute drive south 
of Los Angeles, just off I-5 north of Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THERE'S A SMALL HOTEL 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara is most everybody's favorite weekend town. There are loads of 
fine resorts: Fess Parker's Red Lion Inn, Four Season's Santa Barbara Biltmore, 
Harbor View Inn and King's Inn are a few of the larger digs. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers looking for something more intimate might enjoy the charming 
18-room Villa Rosa, at 15 Chapala St., minutes from the beach. Each large room 
in this Spanish Colonial-style inn is different and decorated in a distinctive 
decor. 
</P>
<P>
This accommodation is sort of a cross between a small hotel and a 
bed-and-breakfast inn, operated with style and panache by Mark and Beverly 
Kirkhart. Off-season rates, in effect for another two months, run $80 to $160 
per couple and include continental breakfast, afternoon wine and cheese, 
evening port and sherry. For information, telephone (805) 966-0851. 
</P>
<P>
Too often overlooked in these days of larger flashy resorts is the 52-room 
Montecito Inn, built in the 1920s by entertainers Charlie Chaplin and Fatty 
Arbuckle. The inn is located at 1295 Coast Village Road, and besides having a 
pool, sauna and whirlpool, it offers complimentary use of bikes to guests. For 
information telephone (800) 843-2017.

COMPANIES USED TO FEAR THAT TARGETING OLDER CONSUMERS WOULD SADDLE THEM WITH A 
DOWDY IMAGE. NOW THEY ARE TARGETING THE AGE GROUP THAT MARKETERS LIKE TO REFER 
TO AS SILVER OR GOLDEN

<P>
Instead of showing teen-agers frolicking on the beach, a new Coca-Cola Classic 
commercial features actor Art Carney, 70, as a grandfather discussing Spin the 
Bottle with his grandson. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every age group is interested in Coca-Cola Classic, so it makes perfect 
sense to have an older person in the commercial," says spokeswoman Georgia 
Camp. 
</P>
<P>
Companies haven't always thought this way. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they focused on a younger audience, "with no one really wondering what 
happened to someone once they turned 50 -- they just drop off the face of the 
earth," says Treesa Drury, 52, advertising standards director for the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
The attitude toward a once-invisible market is changing as retailers realize 
that the 65 million people over 50 control more than half the nation's 
discretionary income. And fast approaching their 50s are the first members of 
that trend-setting generation, the baby boomers, with their unparalleled 
purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
If older consumers have so much money, why haven't companies bothered with them 
before? 
</P>
<P>
Companies used to fear that targeting older consumers would saddle them with a 
dowdy image that would turn off younger shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
People used to joke that it was a "dying market." Now it's a growing market, 
and you can expect to see more "oldster commercials," says Scott Montgomery, 
38, partner and co-creative director at Salvati Montgomery Sakoda, a Costa Mesa 
advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you're 50 and you've bought everything you need," Montgomery 
says, although the myth persists that older people are miserly. Recent research 
shows that it ain't necessarily so. Instead, it reveals what people over 50 
have known all along: They have money and are willing to to spend it. More 
firms are targeting the age group that marketers like to refer to as silver or 
golden. 
</P>
<P>
But please don't call them "50 Plus" or even senior citizens. "Mature" and 
"adult" are the preferred terms. 
</P>
<P>
Or you could try "suppies," (short for senior urban professionals), a term 
mentioned by Ken Dychtwald in his new book, "Age Wave." Dychtwald, a mere kid 
of 38, is the guru of a new senior consciousness. The Emeryville 
communications, marketing and consulting firm he founded three years ago -- 
also called Age Wave -- enlightens corporations about the trend toward older 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like the Paul Reveres of aging America," says Greg Gable, 32, Age Wave's 
director of media projects. "We've awakened a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Age Wave isn't the only company shouting, "The senior spenders are coming!" 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago Richard J. Balkite started Mature Market Network, a Greenwich, 
Conn. consulting firm. His seminars, "How to Mine Gold from the Gray," describe 
marketing to the suppies instead of their yuppie children, who are burdened 
with mortgage payments and child care costs.

"Companies just can't grow with the under-49 market now," Balkite, 47, says. 
And if they want to grab a share of the over-50 market, they need to change 
their game plan. 
</P>
<P>
Older consumers are looking for value, Balkite says. They're willing to switch 
brands, but you have to give them a good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Demeaning television commercials were one of the top dislikes mature people 
mentioned in a 1987 study, Balkite says, running a close second to hard-to-open 
packaging. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, not many people in their prime made it to prime time, and the 
few who did were often goofy grannies, marketing experts note. 
</P>
<P>
Men, meanwhile, had two roles -- the feeble, decrepit old codger and "the wise 
man telling the dopey broad what side is up," says Harold Kassarjian, 59, 
professor at UCLA's Graduate School of Management. After all, "any 60-year-old 
man knows a hell of a lot better about laundry soap than any 25-year-old 
housewife." 
</P>
<P>
Now "it's OK to have a little bit of gray hair showing, even for women," says 
Walter Henry, 53, associate professor and associate dean at UC Riverside's 
Graduate School of Management. "Maybe Barbara Bush is helping this, too, bless 
her heart." 
</P>
<P>
Companies have to be careful, however, because some ads have aggravated instead 
of attracted older viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Denny's commercial that has two "over-55" sisters debating about 
dinner. One sister can't get the name of the restaurant straight and keeps 
calling it "Lenny's." AARP's Drury is among those who contend that the ad 
reinforces a harmful stereotype of older women as frumpy and senile. 
</P>
<P>
Not at all, says Sue Henderson, Denny's vice president of marketing. "Most 
people see it as a bit of humor," Henderson says. "To suggest that you can't 
have humor in any specific group is very demeaning." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson acknowledges receiving "a few isolated complaints" about the ads, and 
quite a few compliments. "Seniors are a big part of our business, and we have 
no desire to offend any of our older customers," she says. "Humor is very 
subjective, but humor is also very memorable." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Upton agrees with Henderson. "I'm amused," says Upton, 67, a retired 
psychiatric technician from Whittier. Upton says she doesn't take the 
absent-minded sister seriously. "People do get forgetful -- young people get 
forgetful, too." 
</P>
<P>
Upton was less fond of the crabby character Clara Peller played in Wendy's 
"Where's the Beef?" commercials. "She didn't portray what the normal lady over 
50 might look like," Upton says, adding that at least the Denny's sisters dress 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Appearance is another AARP concern. When it comes to looks, too often older 
folks -- unlike other age groups -- have been portrayed at their worst, Drury 
says. "TV's teen-agers seem to be experiencing adolescence without acne, braces 
or weight gain, while seniors are shown as stooped, frail and frowzy. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation may be that most ads are designed by youthful copywriters, who 
"just can't relate to matures," Balkite says. Using some older writers could 
help, he says. Another theory is that the image simply reflects the way 
American society views older people. 
</P>
<P>
The frail image was firmly entrenched with advertisers for AARP's Modern 
Maturity magazine. They figured readers must be a sickly lot, Drury says, and 
wanted to hawk "wheelchairs, hemorrhoid remedies and analgesics -- everything 
with pain and doom and gloom." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s the magazine banned certain types of ads (including both 
human and pet caskets), and limited others for medical items. Today Modern 
Maturity regularly turns down ads or suggests they be redone, as part of its 
mission to improve aging's image. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms are discovering on their own that gray-haired models can be 
glamorous, too. At Jockey International, one of the underwear firm's most 
popular ads features a fit, stylish grandma, Wisconsin banker Catherine 
Councell Moll. When Moll, now 58, told the firm two years ago she wasn't "thin 
and slinky," they told her they were looking for someone realistic and 
personable. 
</P>
<P>
Like Coca-Cola, more companies will switch to "trans-generational" ads to sell 
something, Gable says. "You don't need to call it old people's low-salt 
vegetables, just low-salt vegetables," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers will discover "they have to change their mind-set far more than 
they have to change their product," Drury says.

CLEAN-FUEL PROGRAM GOALS NOW APPEAR UNATTAINABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER and MAURA DOLAN, Times Environmental Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evidence is mounting that regional air quality officials have set unattainable 
goals for replacing millions of gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars, trucks and 
buses over the next 10 years with vehicles that run on cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The clean-fuels program is a cornerstone of a visionary strategy to bring the 
smoggy South Coast Air Basin into compliance with federal clean air standards 
by the year 2000. Forty percent of passenger cars, 70% of heavy-duty trucks and 
100% of transit buses would be powered by methanol, electricity or other 
alternative fuels by that date. 
</P>
<P>
But technological and commercial problems are calling into question whether 
those targets can be reached on time. For the first time, some officials of the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District, the state Air Resources Board and 
the California Energy Commission are beginning to question the 10-year 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to meet the clean-vehicles deadline a decade away does not in itself 
mean that the AQMD will fall short of its overall goal to bring the four-county 
South Coast Air Basin into compliance with federal clean air standards by the 
year 2007. The broad plan proposes tough new controls on air pollution from 
factories, motor vehicles and consumer products like paint and aerosol sprays. 
</P>
<P>
But mounting concerns about the clean-fuels deadline point up the herculean 
task faced by the AQMD in transforming the basin's highly complex 
transportation and fuel-supply system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear how (meeting the 10-year fuel deadline is) going to happen," 
state Air Resources Board spokesman Bill Sessa said. "There's no question that 
methanol has a role to play. But we have to question that it can be done by a 
certain time." 
</P>
<P>
AQMD Executive Officer James M. Lents insisted Wednesday that the 2000 deadline 
can be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't say that's out of the question at all at this stage. We'd be premature 
to declare it can't be done before we even get out of the starting blocks," 
Lents said. 
</P>
<P>
But his view is not widely shared even within his own organization. 
</P>
<P>
"That (10-year goal) would seem to be an overestimate. Based on the numbers 
we've seen, that probably is overly ambitious," said AQMD chief scientist Alan 
Lloyd, a strong supporter of the clean-fuels program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a very steep mountain to climb. . . ," state Energy 
Commission Chairman Charles R. Imbrecht said. "If there is any hope of getting 
to the South Coast numbers, it would undoubtedly require full mandates." 
</P>
<P>
Developments here are being closely watched throughout the country by other 
cities plagued by urban air pollution. What happens here is widely viewed as a 
forerunner of efforts elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol-powered vehicles spew out far less soot and particulate matter, which 
reduce visibility, and nitrogen oxides, which are one of two major ingredients 
of photochemical smog. Both pollutants are major causes of human respiratory 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
The state Air Resources Board, which must still ratify the sweeping air quality 
management plan approved by the AQMD in March, is expected to spell out 
additional steps to be taken if the district's clean air goals are to be met. 
</P>
<P>
A number of factors are contributing to the reassessment: 
</P>
<P>
* Oil companies have equipped only a handful of service stations to sell 
methanol fuel. Arco and Chevron USA pledged to the California Energy Commission 
last year that they would each install up to 25 methanol pumps by the end of 
this year. So far, Arco has installed 10 and Chevron eight, with two additional 
Chevron pumps in the planning stage. Oil companies blame automobile makers for 
not turning out cars that use methanol. But auto makers say they are reluctant 
to build alternative-fueled vehicles if the fuel is not available -- producing 
a Catch-22 dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
* Auto makers said there is no way that production of flexible-fueled cars -- 
which can run on either methanol or gasoline -- will begin before 1995. To meet 
the clean-fuel deadline, nine out of every 10 cars sold between 1995 and 2000 
in the Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties would have to 
run on methanol or some other alternative fuel. 
</P>
<P>
* Pressures are building in Washington to persuade the Bush Administration to 
roll back the federal government's 1991 emission standard for transit buses, a 
major force in speeding the production of methanol buses, which are smokeless 
and virtually odorless. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has 
administrative authority to delay the standard, has not ruled out the 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state Air Resources Board, which adopted the same standard before 
the EPA, said it would continue to enforce the rule in California, a federal 
rollback could still have an impact here by making it more difficult for bus 
manufacturers to obtain methanol engines from out-of-state suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
* Three of four counties in the basin have a $1 motor vehicle surcharge 
authorized by the state Legislature to fund the district's $6-million 
clean-fuels program, which underwrites the cost of demonstration programs to 
speed the commercialization of clean-fuel technology. Only Riverside County 
supervisors have approved the surcharge. Lents said the failure of Los Angeles, 
Orange and San Bernardino county supervisors to act threatens the program. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest obstacle is the apparent decision by major auto makers not 
to begin production of cars that can run on both methanol and gasoline until at 
least 1995. The production delay comes despite federal incentives to produce 
the cars earlier in exchange for the privilege of building bigger gas-guzzling 
cars without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Ford and General Motors officials told The Times that there is no way that 
production of methanol-powered cars will begin before 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking six to eight years if the conditions are right before we can 
begin production," said Harvey Klein, manager of Ford's flexible fuels vehicle 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald J. Barnes, manager of international emissions regulations for General 
Motors Corp., agreed, adding that GM has set no production date. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of things could change that," Barnes added. "If we were forced to 
provide vehicles because of a regulatory mandate . . . we would still have some 
lead-time problems but we probably would put some more effort into the 
products." 
</P>
<P>
If cars capable of running on methanol and gasoline are not available until at 
least 1995, there would be only five years at best to replace 2.9 million 
passenger vehicles -- 40% of the total -- with cleaner-fueled versions by the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing 1.3 million or 70% of heavy-duty diesel trucks with cleaner-burning 
engines appears equally formidable, even if fuel additives prove successful in 
allowing existing diesels to burn methanol with a few engine modifications. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reluctance by transit agencies to buy methanol buses stems from 
experiences like those reported in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside Transit Agency compared the maintenance time required for three 
diesel buses and three methanol-powered buses during March. The methanol buses 
were down for repairs for 510.5 hours, compared to only 1.5 hours for the 
diesels, the agency reported. But Detroit Diesel Corp., which manufactured the 
methanol engines, disputed the comparison, saying that not all of the problems 
with the methanol buses could be attributed to its unique fuel system. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the discouraging maintenance statistics from Riverside, both the AQMD 
and the state Air Resources Board said they were confident that a new 
generation of methanol buses would prove to be far less trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning later this month -- nine months behind schedule -- the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District will take delivery on the first of 30 
methanol buses, the first such production-line coaches ever built, as part of a 
$1.87-million, two-year "real world" test. Previous methanol buses have been 
hand-built experimental prototypes. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol fuel costs are expected to be twice as high as diesel. Generally, fuel 
costs represent 2% of a transit district's budget. That percentage would jump 
to at least 4% if buses ran on methanol. 
</P>
<P>
Still, air quality officials believe cleaner-burning fuels are worth the cost. 
They note that gasoline prices have increased 25% in the last month in the wake 
of the grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez and other market factors. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol enthusiasts say the fuel gives cars superior performance. A third of 
Californians now pay 15 cents to 20 cents more for high-octane premium gasoline 
to get better performance. Methanol has a higher octane rating than premium 
unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Barker, an energy commission spokeswoman, said she recently drove a GM 
Corsica on methanol fuel from Sacramento to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not believe the driving, the handling, the maneuverability," she said. 
"You were cruising above the speed limit before you knew it." Methanol has long 
been used in race cars.

MISZCZAK'S HAMBURGERS; 
</P>
<P>
POLES EAGER FOR PIECE OF FREE MARKET

WARSAW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As usual, it was a frenetic morning in Warsaw's infant hamburger business. 
Mikolaj Miszczak was up to his elbows in a tub of ground meat, trying to get 
the patties made. The griddle was empty. The customers were baying. Ursula, his 
wife and only waitress, was standing in the kitchen doorway, hands on hips. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day it's like this," he said, dropping a load of meat the size of a 
basketball onto a tray and scooping out fistfuls to form into burgers. "I'm 
butcher, cook, farmer, truck driver, lawyer, accountant." 
</P>
<P>
"Ready, Mikolaj?" Ursula said. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first burgers hit the griddle in a spatter of grease, and Ursula, relieved 
at this tangible sign of progress, turned to placate the customers, sitting at 
three tables and standing in a short line that extended to the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veteran of Many Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Miszczak is 27, a law school dropout and, like many young men and women of 
Poland, the veteran of a dozen brief jobs, mostly menial, in half a dozen West 
European and Scandinavian countries. Now, like thousands of others who are 
taking part in this country's latest phenomenon, he has taken his modest 
grubstake and is trying his hand at private business. 
</P>
<P>
It is stretching his energy, resources and cunning to the hilt, but for the 
moment Mike Miszczak, as his friends call him, can claim to be the proud if 
struggling owner of Warsaw's first and only genuine hamburger joint. A year 
ago, even six months ago, it would have been impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, when Poland's Communist government, under siege on all economic 
and political fronts, shoveled aside the worst of the bureaucratic muck that 
for years had blocked the roads to private enterprise, about 20,000 Poles in 
Warsaw alone have filed official notice that they are going into business for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No National Figures 
</P>
<P>
No figures at the national level are readily available, but it is estimated 
that three or four times the Warsaw number have done the same elsewhere in this 
country, where the vast majority of 37 million citizens would like nothing 
better than to kiss communism goodby forever. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these businesses are modest in the extreme -- basement and garage 
operations, capitalism's ground floor, where housewives with a copying machine 
sell photocopies to neighbors, or peddlers announce their intention to sell 
farm-fresh eggs at a kiosk or to do business as door-to-door salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
But the range is vast, and even the most modest entrepreneurs harbor larger 
ambitions in a country where moribund state-run systems predominate, where the 
simplest goods and services are in short supply and where demand virtually 
always outstrips supply. 
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, from toilet paper to carpet tacks -- let alone the carpet 
-- it is a wide-open market. 
</P>
<P>
Piotr Kulesza, 28, has opened a shop renting out compact disc recordings. He 
has at least four competitors in Warsaw. Kulesza's shop at the edge of downtown 
Warsaw is a block from Communist Party headquarters and, more helpfully, an 
equal distance from a ready market of students at Warsaw University. 
</P>
<P>
This might seem an odd business in a Western country, but here, where the price 
(approximately $15) of compact disc recordings is in the luxury range, it makes 
good sense and a nice profit. For 1,500 Polish zlotys (about $3) a customer can 
rent a CD for two days. Or, for the same price, he can listen to it on 
headphones and use one of five tape cassette recorders to make a copy. 
</P>
<P>
The doorways in residential districts of the city have become dotted with small 
signs advertising new businesses. In the view of some Poles, there is a sense 
of awakening, of a quickening of activity that seems to hum just beneath the 
crumbling surface of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Economists argue that such small enterprises cannot pull Poland out of its 
economic mess, resolve its $39-billion foreign debt or provide an alternative 
source of income for the millions of Polish workers employed in antiquated and 
unprofitable heavy industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Point the Way 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, economic experts suggest, even these modest beginnings can 
point the way to the future. Along the way, the infant private sector helps to 
relieve some of the pressure of shortages and to provide additional jobs and 
income, most of it recycling into the system. It is, they say, like massaging 
the first tingling sensations of life into a paralyzed limb. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I am an optimist," said Waldemar Milik, who has set up business 
installing auto alarms in the basement garage of his mother's house in a 
residential section of Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had no hope," he said, "I would choose another solution. The fact that I 
am here means I have hope for the future. I think if someone is resourceful 
enough, it is possible to make it now. And any kind of private economic 
activity is preferable to working for the state. You have to work hard, but 
there is no difficulty in staying above the average income." 
</P>
<P>
Milik's small operation is typical of many. It supports him and two employees, 
one full-time and one part-time. As with many such businessmen, his principal 
constraints are a lack of space to expand and a general wariness of Poland's 
capricious tax laws, which, even though relaxed, still hit him for up to 50% of 
his profits. 
</P>
<P>
He is part of a network of like-minded entrepreneurs. The outfit that supplies 
his car alarms, which he says are the equal of anything sold in the United 
States but sell for a quarter of the price, are manufactured in a garage in 
another neighborhood. The owner, Krysztof Celinski, and a partner make 5,000 of 
them a year and supply Milik and four other installers. 
</P>
<P>
The alarm business almost takes care of itself and has helped finance research 
and development on another line, a device that measures the intensity of laser 
beams, a bit of electronic hardware that has important uses in industry. 
</P>
<P>
Celinski's partner is a neighbor, Andrzej Herman, and their nearly completed 
prototype, a refinement on an already available commercial model brought to 
them by a Canadian firm, has already resulted, they say, in 20 orders at 3.5 
million zlotys each. Although that would be $7,000 at official exchange rates, 
in real market money it comes to about $1,000, which should make the device 
highly attractive to international buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever you want to make in Poland," he said, "you will find a demand for it. 
There is the problem of prices, however. You can go very high, because of the 
shortages on the market. But you can go too high and shut too many people out." 
</P>
<P>
At the new "Hamburger Bar," Mike Miszczak, too, worries about prices -- 480 
zlotys (just under a dollar) seems a lot, he thinks, for a Pole to have to pay 
for a hamburger. But prices in Poland are further complicated by the burgeoning 
free-market currency dealers, now licensed and legal and selling U.S. dollars 
for about 3,700 zlotys each. At this rate, 480 zlotys is about 20 cents, and 
that makes for a bargain anywhere. It is one of the complications of doing 
business in an economy like Poland's. 
</P>
<P>
But that's only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Miszczak's day starts at 5 a.m. with a trip to the outskirts of Warsaw to pick 
up buns -- specially made and a close approximation of an American-style 
hamburger bun, an item unheard of here, where the taste is for thick, dense 
bread. By 9 a.m. he has opened for business, and he works nonstop for the next 
12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Then," he said, "I think." 
</P>
<P>
He has had a problem finding people to work for him. When he was setting up, he 
hired a waiter from a hotel restaurant. Miszczak wanted the waiter to stay -- 
he was on vacation from the hotel -- but the waiter demanded 500,000 zlotys a 
month, five times the average Polish worker's wage. A woman Miszczak wanted to 
hire to help clean up turned down 250,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Miszczak's meat supply has consisted of one cow and two pigs -- his 
burgers are a beef-pork mixture -- and this has required going out to the 
country to personally negotiate with a farmer, over vodka at 8 a.m., the price 
of the animals, which have been fed heavily just before slaughter to increase 
their weight. And there is the cost of the butcher and the grinding of the 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
The grill in the shop is slow and takes eight meat patties at a time. Miszczak 
would like to serve them on paper plates, but these are of course nonexistent 
in Poland. He serves them on butcher paper, which is also hard to come by and, 
in fact, was sold to him "out the back door" of a state-run butcher shop. This 
is an example -- one of many -- of how state employees supplement their income. 
</P>
<P>
Everything, Miszczak said, is an adventure, an exercise in uncertainty. Others 
involve the tax man, the landlord, the new problem of gasoline shortages. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also exhilarating, for all its trouble, and Miszczak is full of ideas 
and plans for the times when, as he said, "I think." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks he might buy a small slaughterhouse -- he knows one that is available 
-- to eliminate his problem with the farmer. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks maybe a pizza oven would be a good addition. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks he knows where he can find the iron to make a better grill. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks he should forget the pizza oven and stick to hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, he thinks his place is too small. He thinks he needs to perfect the 
operation but that he can't grow enough here. He thinks that what he would like 
is a really big place, up on Warsaw's main drag, Marszalkowska, open 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that would be great," he says.

U.S. SEEKS WAYS TO WIN RACE FOR HIGHLY DEFINED TV 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is launching a fast-track effort to come up with 
measures that can help propel the United States into the race to produce 
high-definition television -- possibly including relaxation of federal 
antitrust laws and a new research and development tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Wednesday that a new interagency task force headed by 
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher is exploring these and other options, 
although it has not yet decided which of them to endorse or even whether the 
government should act. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is concerned because high-definition TV, which offers 
viewers a television picture that has the clarity of motion-picture film, is 
likely to dominate the television market of the future. Yet Japan has taken the 
lead in developing it, while U.S. firms have stayed out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Mosbacher has begun consulting informally with U.S. 
electronics and telecommunications firms on the new technology and is scheduled 
to meet with industry representatives next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the proposals the task force is considering so far 
would be limited to development of high-definition television -- or HDTV as it 
is commonly called. But they said that some proposals -- such as relaxing the 
antitrust laws so that U.S. firms could launch joint production and 
manufacturing efforts -- could have broader application. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher has said several times that he believes the time is ripe to propose 
such changes. Congress is deeply concerned about the ability of U.S. firms to 
compete internationally. And the public mood on antitrust issues has changed as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Wednesday that the Administration may seek to make its 
proposal to cut capital gains taxes a part of any HDTV package. Mosbacher 
believes that a reduction in capital gains taxes is necessary to help high-tech 
firms raise the capital they need. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's efforts come as the industry, too, has begun exploring 
ways to catch up with the Japanese. The American Electronics Assn. has hired a 
private consulting group to draft a plan for U.S. entry into the field and 
plans to unveil it to Congress next week. 
</P>
<P>
Still, experts warn that the entry of the United States into the market is far 
from assured. Critics already have begun questioning whether it is even 
realistic for U.S. firms to seek to develop HDTV technology on their own, given 
the Japanese lead in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials said that Mosbacher hopes to fashion any new 
Administration HDTV package on the basis of what the U.S. industry itself 
believes will be feasible in the next several years. At this point, they said, 
that still is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Mosbacher himself still has not decided whether the group should 
recommend a relaxation of antitrust laws or any of the other options now on the 
table. They said that the secretary especially wants to "remove any 
impediments" that the government is imposing. 
</P>
<P>
Under any such plan, relaxation of the federal antitrust laws would be 
necessary only to enable companies to cooperate in the production and 
manufacture of HDTV products. Joint efforts for research and development 
already are permitted under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible measure being considered, restoration of the tax credit for 
research and development, would bring back a tax incentive that Congress 
enacted in the early 1980s but later repealed. 
</P>
<P>
The United States already is providing seed money for research and development 
on HDTV. In early March, 87 high-technology firms submitted applications for 
$30 million in Defense Department grants. The Pentagon is interested in HDTV 
for military applications. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute issued a study recently that 
predicted that unless the United States moves aggressively into the new 
technology, it could lose more than 2 million jobs a year and suffer a $225 
billion trade deficit in electronics by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Japan expects to have an HDTV system in full operation by the mid-1990s.

WEAPONS MAKERS FACE PROTRACTED DOWNTURN

Weapons producers are girding for a painful and protracted downturn in which 
important military programs will be canceled and workers laid off, prompting 
concern that the industry may never see another heyday quite like the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics Corp., Hughes Aircraft Co., Litton Industries Inc., Lockheed 
Corp., Northrop Corp. and TRW Inc. have been laying off workers from at least 
some of their divisions in Southern California and anticipate further moderate 
cutbacks or zero growth for some time, the contractors have told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Although defense spending has slumped, a precipitous downturn in employment is 
not looming. Rather, a steady moderate erosion is expected to depress the 
industry and is likely to be offset only by strength in commercial aircraft 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Weaker companies will drop out of the industry or merge with stronger 
competitors, leaving the United States with a smaller weapons manufacturing 
capacity and a more concentrated industry, executives said in a series of 
recent interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in federal defense budgets is expected to continue until at least 
the mid-1990s, forcing additional cancellations of weapons programs, employee 
layoffs and slumping profits. 
</P>
<P>
Although industry optimists hope that spending will grow once again to 
modernize the armed forces after the mid-1990s, some analysts believe that the 
U.S. defense industry may have begun an unprecedented period of long-term 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason why the defense budget should turn back up," said James 
Blackwell, an analyst at the conservative Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington. "There are big cuts coming that we have to 
face." 
</P>
<P>
The first installment occurred last week when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
unveiled a $10-billion cut in Pentagon spending plans for 1990 alone. At least 
an additional $64 billion in planned spending must be cut over the succeeding 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Although funding for weapons procurement has been declining steadily for 
several years, not until recently has the Pentagon begun to pare its list of 
weapons programs. As a result, there is an estimated $400-billion gap between 
weapons procurement plans and the funding that is available for them, according 
to Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
Defense procurement funding has plunged 44% on an inflation-adjusted basis 
since its 1985 peak. The full effect has not hit the companies because the long 
contracting pipeline from Washington to the industry is still full of older 
contracts. Just as the Reagan administration's buildup of the early 1980s took 
years to gather steam, the decline is taking years to fully reach the industry. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, real defense spending has fallen because inflation has eaten into 
the purchasing power of the available dollars, so the effect on industry has 
been and will continue to be gradual. Few major defense contractors in 
California, which employ an estimated 758,000 aerospace workers, expect 
employment to fall precipitously, and many are even confident that they can 
avoid the worst effects of any downturn. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we might find ourselves in a severe budget environment, I would 
expect that we would do reasonably well," said Ralph Hawes, a General Dynamics 
executive vice president who oversees four of the company's divisions in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Vice President Alan C. Chase said, "We feel relatively good about how 
we fared in the budget outcome. Our programs are of significant national 
importance, so they are durable." 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks in defense have been largely offset on the West Coast by a 
historic boom in commercial aircraft production. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas has added about 20,000 jobs during the 1980s at its Douglas 
Aircraft unit in Long Beach for commercial aircraft production, and 
subcontractors have added thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobs Added 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has added 28,000 jobs in Washington state in commercial aircraft 
production. The company spends more on subcontracting in Southern California 
than in any other region. 
</P>
<P>
But not all defense firms participate in commercial aircraft production, and 
the declining defense budget has resulted in some rude surprises. 
</P>
<P>
For example, TRW was hit unexpectedly last year with stop-work orders on three 
major secret programs. The firm was forced to undergo its first layoffs in 
years, ultimately letting 1,000 workers go. 
</P>
<P>
TRW Executive Vice President Edsel D. Dunford said recently that the company 
anticipates a tough four or five years ahead, but no major downturn in 
employment is foreseen at its Redondo Beach operation this year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northrop has dropped 2,300 jobs on its B-2 stealth bomber program in 
Pico Rivera and Palmdale in the last two years and expects to continue laying 
off workers. Northrop officials said they could not provide projections for 
additional layoffs but that the layoffs are attributable to the completion of 
B-2 development activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said last week that it has decided to postpone production of the 
bomber, owing to funding constraints and technical problems, which have delayed 
any employment buildup at Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
The delays in the massive $68-billion B-2 program are having a ripple effect in 
the industry. Hughes Aircraft, which builds the radar for the B-2, may have to 
reduce its B-2 work force of 1,500, according to Hughes Chairman Malcolm R. 
Currie. In addition to the B-2 program, Hughes took major hits in its radar 
programs for the F-14, F-15 and F-18 fighter planes, some of the firm's most 
important projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just trying to assess the impact," Currie said. "It affects programs 
adding up to $1.5 billion (in annual sales) at Hughes. Some of them are 
stretched out, some of them are reduced and some are being cut (totally). 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to hit us across the company but not in a drastic way. The bright 
spot is that a lot of these programs are very important, and I think they will 
go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Litton Industries said they anticipate flat defense budgets for at 
least several years and do not regard defense as a growth business. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has cut employment at its Guidance and Control Division in the San 
Fernando Valley by 10% in the past year but has been adding workers at its Data 
Systems Division. On balance, the firm's defense-related work force of 6,500 
will trend slightly downward, Litton spokesman Robert Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
The downturn facing the defense industry will be seriously exacerbated by a 
surge in the prices of new weapons, something that has been termed 
"superinflation" by Norman R. Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta Corp., a 
producer of military spacecraft and defense electronics based in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is being squeezed between declining procurement budgets on the one 
side and sharply higher prices for weapons on the other, Augustine said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the B-2 bomber will cost a projected $500 million each, compared 
to $280 million for the B-1 bomber. And the new Advanced Tactical Fighter will 
cost at least $50 million each, compared to about $20 million for the F-16. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have a 2% budget decline for too long because of the compounding of 
superinflation before it gets to you," Augustine said. "That's the reason we 
are finding it so difficult to cut the budget very much farther. 
</P>
<P>
"You pretty soon have take out big chunks of force structure. From where I sit, 
it is hard for me to see that is good for the country." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the Pentagon is finding that it simply cannot afford to produce 
weapons that it has spent billions of dollars developing. The latest weapon to 
be terminated after development was the V-22 tilt-rotor, a hybrid 
helicopter-airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Production will probably be delayed on such new weapons as the Advanced 
Tactical Fighter, which Northrop and Lockheed are developing for the Air Force, 
and the Navy's A-12 Advanced Tactical Aircraft, being developed by McDonnell 
Douglas and General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of increasing weapons costs, persistent budget deficits and 
reduced international tensions has led some analysts to question the need for 
continued defense spending at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cold War is over," declared Josh Epstein, a researcher at the Brookings 
Institution in Washington. "The troops are still where they stopped at the end 
of World War II. Why have a politically anachronistic military competition in 
Europe?" 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said public 
sentiment seems to be moving away from defense spending. He projects that the 
nation could settle toward a $250-billion annual defense budget, far below the 
1990 fiscal year's projected $295.6-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Americans now view Japan and Europe as greater threats to their national 
prosperity than the Soviet Union is to national security, Blackwell noted. 
</P>
<P>
"In the current procurement environment, defense firms are leaving the industry 
in droves because they can't make an adequate profit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawes, the General Dynamics executive, is concerned that the industry is losing 
weapons production capacity that would be difficult to regain. "We are building 
ourselves a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Hawes and other executives at the major prime contractors are 
confident that conditions will turn around in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not yet willing to declare this world as the sort of peaceful, kinder, 
gentler world that we all wish it would be," said Martin Marietta's Augustine. 
"Until that happens, the best thing to promote peace is to build strength. The 
problems (between nations) still exist and have existed since the beginning of 
mankind, and I am afraid may exist for a lot longer, too." 
</P>
<P>
Both pessimists and optimists agree on one matter: The defense industry may 
never see another peacetime buildup like the one that occurred during the 
Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will ever see another Reagan buildup again," said Ron 
Hertenstein, director of research at Forecast Associates, a market research 
firm in Connecticut. "There seemed to be money for everybody, and there was 
rapid growth everywhere in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't foresee that happening again. We are going to end up with a lean, 
thinner industry." 
</P>

Chart, DOWNTURN IN DEFENSE SPENDING -- Procurement spending has declined by 44% 
since it peaked in 1985, while research and development spending has remained 
flat after climbing steeply in the early 1980s. The figures are expressed in 
terms of "budget authority," which authorizes spending for periods of longer 
than a year. Thus, the full effect of the decline has not yet been felt by 
local defense contractors. The figures are in constant 1990 dollars, which 
eliminates the effects of past inflation. Source: Department of Defense. Los

The Navy believes it can repair the damaged gun turret on the battleship Iowa 
for around $15 million to $20 million, with the lower figure more likely, 
defense sources said. The sources, speaking one day after Pentagon officials 
announced it was technically feasible to repair the turret after last month's 
fatal explosion, stressed the dollar estimate was preliminary and that no 
decision had been made to authorize the work.

The man who was skipper of the tanker Exxon Valdez when it struck a reef and 
caused the nation's largest oil spill pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, 
including operating the vessel while drunk. Joseph Hazelwood, 42, entered the 
plea through his attorney in a 15-minute proceeding in Anchorage before Alaska 
Judge David Stewart. Hazelwood, who was silent and declined to answer 
reporters' questions, was ushered out a back door of the courtroom immediately 
after the hearing. Hazelwood, who was fired by Exxon after the March 24 
accident, is charged with operating a vessel while drunk, reckless endangerment 
and negligent discharge of oil.

Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in an extraordinary personal appearance 
before Congress, tried to rally support for raising federal judges' salaries 
30%. The first chief justice in about 50 years to testify before Congress, 
Rehnquist acknowledged that many Americans think federal judges already are 
paid handsomely. But he called current judicial salaries inadequate and said 
they would cause "more resignations from the bench, more damage to the morale 
of those judges who remain and more difficulty in recruiting new judges." 
Rehnquist told the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee that a 30% pay 
hike is needed immediately, but Chairman William D. Ford (D-Mich.) indicated 
the committee is not likely to take any action until next fall at the earliest. 
A 30% increase would boost the chief justice's annual salary from $115,000 to 
$149,500. Salaries of Supreme Court justices would rise from $110,000 to 
$143,000 and appeals court judges from $95,000 to $123,000.

President Augusto Pinochet's military government withdrew an offer to reform 
Chile's constitution after opposition parties rejected the proposals as 
insufficient. "In the face of this rejection . . . there is no room for any 
reform. The opposition has closed all possibility of achieving the necessary 
consensus," Interior Minister Carlos Caceres said in a statement. Saying he was 
"disappointed" with the opposition response, Caceres ruled out any further 
negotiations and said the government will concentrate on preparing for 
December's elections.

The Senate Rules Committee unanimously approved a bill that would give members 
of the Legislature a 10% pay raise, from $40,816 annually to $44,898. The 
increase would take effect Dec. 3, 1990, a month after the next general 
election. State lawmakers last voted themselves a salary boost two years ago. 
Besides salary, legislators also receive a tax-free $88 daily allowance for 
expenses, seven days a week, while the Legislature is in session. Senators 
averaged $17,500 in tax-free per diem last year. They also receive leased 
vehicles, free gasoline, telephone credit cards, generous pensions and life and 
medical insurance. Under the state Constitution, legislative pay raises are 
limited to a maximum of 5% a year. Most pay raise bills have covered a two-year 
period since 1966, when the voters gave lawmakers the authority to increase 
legislative salaries.

NEW MUSLIM DEATH THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Egyptian Nobel literary laureate Naguib Mahfouz said Islamic extremists have 
vowed to kill him for blasphemy in a threat similar to that made by the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Salman Rushdie. "Police have offered me 
protection after Muslim extremists announced their intention to kill me," 
Mahfouz told reporters. "I refused because police protection could disturb my 
life and disrupt my day-to-day habits." Mahfouz, 77, sharply criticized 
Khomeini, Iran's leader, when he urged Muslims to kill Rushdie, author of "The 
Satanic Verses." Security sources said the order against Mahfouz was probably 
issued by Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, a blind theologian who some Egyptian Muslim 
radicals in the outlawed Islamic Jihad group regard as their mentor.

BUSH TO VETO COMPROMISE WAGE HIKE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House said that President Bush will veto compromise legislation 
worked out by the House and Senate to raise the minimum wage from $3.35 to 
$4.55 an hour by 1991. Reacting to the agreement Tuesday between House and 
Senate negotiators on legislation to change the wage rate for the first time in 
eight years, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush continues 
to believe the figure is too high. "The President's position is the same, and 
he reiterated that" during a meeting with Republican senators, the spokesman 
said. "His first proposal (for a $4.25 top rate) was his last proposal. . . . 
He is prepared to veto the bill if they send it up." Bush's stance sets up the 
first showdown on domestic policy involving the new President and the 
Democratic-controlled Congress.

COURT TELLS ARMY TO REINSTATE GAY; SKIPS WIDER ISSUE

A federal appeals court Wednesday ordered the Army to reinstate a soldier who 
was discharged because he was a homosexual, but stopped short of declaring that 
military regulations against gay soldiers are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-4 decision from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, reached on the 
narrow issues of Sgt. Perry Watkins' discharge in 1983, represented a step back 
from a sweeping ruling of a three-judge panel last year that provided broad 
constitutional protections for homosexuals in the military. 
</P>
<P>
But the new ruling, nonetheless, held that the Army can be sued for treating 
homosexuals and other soldiers unfairly, a ruling that potentially holds the 
military accountable to the courts for a broad spectrum of military decisions 
that have historically been immune from judicial review. 
</P>
<P>
The court majority held that it did not need to decide that Watkins' 
constitutional rights had been violated before ordering him reinstated to the 
position he had held for more than 14 years -- with the Army's full knowledge 
that he was a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where equity cries out and demands that the Army be estopped 
from refusing to reenlist Watkins on the basis of his homosexuality," Judge 
Harry Pregerson wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
"To estop the Army from denying Sgt. Watkins' reenlistment on the basis of his 
homosexuality would not disrupt any important military policies or adversely 
affect internal military affairs," the majority said. "It would simply require 
the Army to continue to do what it has done for 14 years with only positive 
results: reenlist a single soldier with an exceptionally outstanding military 
record." 
</P>
<P>
But four judges dissented, in large part questioning the majority's exercise of 
judicial review over military decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the majority's intrusion into military affairs, 
unjustified by important federal interests, will have a disruptive effect on 
military discipline," Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall wrote, accusing the majority 
of simply ordering Watkins reinstated because of a "steadfast desire" to avoid 
deciding the constitutional issues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Watkins' attorney, James Lobsenz, called the court's failure to uphold 
the earlier ruling "a blessing in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
"If they had decided the case favorably to Sgt. Watkins on those grounds, the 
chances would be greatly increased, to a near certainty, that the case would go 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, and who knows what would happen there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An Army spokesman said it was too early to say whether the reinstatement order 
would be appealed and declined to comment on the opinion in detail. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Greg Rixon did say, however, that he knows of no other case in which 
the courts exercised jurisdiction over day-to-day military decision-making 
through the legal doctrine known as equitable estoppel. 
</P>
<P>
"The military position is that homosexuality is incompatible with military 
service, and the courts have repeatedly upheld that policy," Rixon said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gay Groups Hail Ruling 
</P>
<P>
Gay rights groups throughout the country hailed the new decision, while 
expressing regret that it did not go as far as the court's earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"This opinion is a victory, not only for Watkins, but for all gay Americans," 
said Nan D. Hunter, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Lesbian 
and Gay Rights Project. "Although it did not reach the broader constitutional 
issues, the court's ruling, nonetheless, exposes the flagrant irrationality of 
a policy which would exclude excellent soldiers like Sgt. Watkins from the 
Army." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, now 40, stated on his pre-induction medical form at the time he was 
drafted in 1967 that he had homosexual tendencies. He again identified himself 
as a homosexual on several occasions throughout his Army service, and was 
allowed to re-enlist, despite the Army's non-waiverable policy against 
re-enlisting homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
In evaluations throughout his military service, supervisors praised Watkins for 
doing "a fantastic job." He was, one commanding officer said, "the best clerk I 
have ever known." Watkins was recommended for discharge after the Army drafted 
revised regulations in 1981 mandating the discharge of all homosexuals, 
regardless of merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sued for Benefits 
</P>
<P>
He sued for reinstatement and the Army retirement benefits he claimed to have 
earned. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William Norris, who authored the original sweeping 9th Circuit opinion 
issued in February, 1988, concurred with the decision to reinstate Watkins. But 
he continued to argue that the Army regulations violate the U.S. Constitution's 
provisions guaranteeing citizens equal protection of the laws. 
</P>
<P>
Though past U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held that the Constitution's due 
process provisions do not prevent states from prohibiting specific homosexual 
conduct, such as sodomy, the high court has been silent on whether 
discrimination based on homosexual orientation is barred by the equal 
protection clause, Norris argued, joined by Judge William C. Canby. 
</P>
<P>
"In any case, homosexuals do not become 'fair game' for discrimination simply 
because their sexual practices are not considered part of our mainstream 
traditions," Norris wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warranted Reinstatement 
</P>
<P>
But the court majority said it was not necessary to decide the constitutional 
question when the facts of Watkins' case warranted a court order for 
reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the courts are limited in the cases in which they can interfere with 
governmental decision-making. Under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, a court 
must find that the government has engaged in affirmative misconduct, that the 
government's misconduct will cause a serious injustice and that stopping the 
government from continuing the wrong will not cause undue harm to the public 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
In using those criteria, the court adopted a less stringent test for judicial 
intervention in military affairs than has traditionally been applied -- a test 
which has historically allowed such intervention only when constitutional 
rights have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the court majority neatly sidestepped the constitutional issue, but was 
still able to order Watkins reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Lobsenz, Watkins' lawyer, compared the legal doctrine to promising a child 
dessert if he eats his carrots then, after he eats his carrots, telling him the 
parent has changed his mind, and he won't get dessert after all. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government tells you for years and years and years, we don't care if 
you're gay, it's not a bar to your military career, and then you spend 15 years 
of your life in the military, and then they say, 'Hey, we changed our mind, 
you're gone,' that's not fair," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
By applying the doctrine to the military, Watkins' lawyer said, the court 
broadened its own jurisdiction over military affairs, at least in the 9th 
Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"It will make them (the military) more accountable, in that they'll realize 
they'll no longer have this sort of iron curtain where they'll be able to say 
the courts won't touch us, because they know they can't interfere." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, now employed with the U.S. Forest Service in Seattle, said he is 
confident the courts will eventually rule on the constitutional rights of gays 
in the military. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enough people now that are finding it necessary to go to court and 
argue for their rights that the issue is not dead, by any means," he said, 
adding that all he wants now are his Army retirement benefits.

A jogger who was beaten and raped in Central Park has emerged from her two-week 
coma, spoken to relatives and expressed a desire to resume running, doctors 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have some pretty good news," said Robert S. Kurtz, assistant chief 
of surgery at Metropolitan Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtz and Kent Duffy, chief of neurosurgery, said the 28-year-old woman began 
responding Tuesday and had spoken in a whisper to relatives and staff members, 
raised two fingers when asked to do so and was able to read large signs printed 
with yes, no and her name. 
</P>
<P>
When a nurse told the patient Tuesday that she would like to resume jogging, 
the patient replied, "Me, too," Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kurtz said, the woman's brother "walked into her room and said, 
'Can you say hello?' And she said hello. There's definite recognition" of her 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, an investment banker, was on her regular jog through Central Park 
the night of April 19 when a gang of youths attacked her. Six teen-agers have 
been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy and assault. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she was found, hours later, she had lost three-fourths of her blood 
and her temperature had fallen to 80 degrees, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"She has been emerging gradually over the last couple of days or three days," 
Kurtz said. "We would still say . . . she is in a delirium. People in this 
stage will fluctuate." 
</P>
<P>
When hospital staff flashed the signs and she responded, "three or four people 
started clapping. I was one of them," Kurtz said.

President Pieter W. Botha said Wednesday that a general election will be held 
Sept. 6. He is expected to retire shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The election will be the first in which white, mixed-race and Asian voters cast 
ballots on the same day for Parliament's three segregated chambers. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's black majority has no vote in national affairs and no 
representation in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
September marks the end of the five-year term for the Asian and mixed-race 
chambers, which were established in 1984 after widely boycotted elections for 
voters of those racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent white general election was in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Botha's National Party is heavily favored to retain its overwhelming majority 
in the dominant white chamber, where it now holds 130 of the 178 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Botha, 73, last month announced his intention to retire after the elections, 
although he did not set a date for the balloting at that time. He has headed 
the government since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The new president is expected to be the national education minister, Frederik 
W. de Klerk, 53, who succeeded Botha as National Party leader on Feb. 2. Many 
Nationalists view De Klerk as more flexible than Botha and more capable of 
breaking the country's black-white political stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
While the National Party will seek to retain its majority, the extreme-right 
Conservative Party and the anti-apartheid Democratic Party will be vying to be 
the largest opposition faction. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives, with 23 seats, currently have a three-seat edge over the 
Democratic Party.

ARAFAT DECLINES TO CLARIFY STAND ON PLO CHARTER 
</P>

<P>
In the face of sharp criticism from rival Palestinian leaders, Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat refused Wednesday to clarify his 
use of an ambiguous French word that has stirred hopes of progress toward peace 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not come here to give a course on language and law," Arafat snapped at 
reporters at a press conference at the Institute of the Arab World. "You can 
find the translation in the dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
"It is enough that some people, including President Mitterrand, understand the 
word." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, after meetings with French President Francois Mitterrand and 
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, Arafat employed the French word caduc, which is 
variously defined by dictionaries as "outdated," "lapsed," "decrepit," 
"old-fashioned" or "null and void" -- to describe the status of the 
controversial 1964 PLO charter calling for the elimination of the Israeli 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Later he said he intended the word in a "specific, legal, technical" sense. The 
French radio network, RF1, reported that Arafat has translated the word into 
English as "superseded." 
</P>
<P>
In the extremely delicate peace process the PLO hopes will lead to an 
independent Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied territory on the West Bank, 
shades of meaning are important and ambiguities are sometimes preferred. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO charter, which speaks of the "liberation of Palestine" as a national 
duty and calls for the elimination "of the Zionist presence from Palestine," 
has been cited by Israelis as one proof that Arafat's acknowledgment of 
Israel's right to exist and his renunciation of terrorism last year did not 
represent a true policy change. 
</P>
<P>
The use of the French term by Arafat, who does not speak French, has put the 
word caduc at the center of speculation about the achievements of the 
unprecedented "official" visit to France, a step many feel will eventually lead 
Arafat to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The daily tabloid Liberation published an enlarged dictionary definition of the 
word on its front page Wednesday. That august protector of the French language, 
the Academie Francaise, jumped into the fray, pointing out that the word dates 
to the 14th Century in France but has been used for legal matters since the 
16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, politicians and journalists had created an apparently 
new noun -- caducite or "the state of being caduc" to describe the affair. An 
anchor on the evening broadcast said: "It all revolves around one word -- a 
word that shocks, a word that grates, a word that surprises. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In short, for the verbal French, it could not have been a more satisfying 
official visit, despite -- or possibly because of -- the uncertainty of what 
was actually said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mitterrand -- who has received serious criticism from France's 
large Jewish population for inviting Arafat -- was pleased. According to aides, 
Mitterrand had hoped to win some concessions from the PLO before visiting 
President Bush later this month. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to push the slow-moving peace process along, he had pressed Arafat 
on Tuesday to clarify the status of the charter. "This was the first sign of 
clarification," Mitterrand said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the State Department in Washington said: "We see this as a 
reinforcement of his prior statement acknowledging Israel's right to exist." A 
decision by the Palestine National Council, the organization's legislative 
body, "formally amending or abrogating the charter would be the kind of action 
we would certainly applaud," spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler added. 
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli leaders and Arafat's political rivals in the PLO reacted 
negatively to his statement. 
</P>
<P>
George Habash, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a 
Marxist hard-line faction, said he was "horrified." 
</P>
<P>
"We shall show Arafat and the world that the PLO charter remains very well 
alive," Habash told the Associated Press. "Arafat has no right to take such 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli spokesman, meanwhile, dismissed Arafat's statement as "rhetorical 
juggling." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Habash's strong criticism, Arafat said: "That's an expression of 
the Palestine democracy. Everyone has the right to state his point of view."

SIHANOUK WILLING TO JOIN REGIME IN CAMBODIA; 
</P>
<P>
SETS CONDITIONS TO RETURN AS HEAD OF STATE IN DEAL APART FROM REBEL ALLIES

<P>
In an apparent breakthrough in the talks on Cambodia's political future, exiled 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk said Wednesday that he is now willing to return to 
Phnom Penh as the country's head of state, even if he must abandon his 
coalition allies in the ultra-left Khmer Rouge and enter into a new partnership 
with the current, Vietnamese-backed government. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here after two days of talks, Sihanouk said he had given 
the Phnom Penh government clear conditions for his participation in the regime. 
These included a constitutional amendment changing Cambodia from a socialist 
country to a multi-party system and the setting up of a four-party government 
during the transition to free elections. 
</P>
<P>
But Sihanouk made clear after his talks with Cambodian Premier Hun Sen that he 
accepts the constitutional changes announced by Phnom Penh as significant 
compromises. 
</P>
<P>
"Already we have made tremendous progress in Jakarta," Sihanouk said. 
</P>
<P>
The talks hosted by Indonesia were the third round of discussions in a year 
aimed at finding an internal political settlement before Vietnamese forces 
complete their scheduled withdrawal by Sept. 30. The Vietnamese invaded 
Cambodia in late 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge government, which has been 
blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1 million Cambodians from killings, 
torture and disease during its 3 1/2-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Sihanouk gave a bravura performance at a packed press 
conference, calling Hun Sen "a bad boy," telling reporters that their frequent 
description of his behavior as mercurial was accurate and warning that when he 
returns to Bangkok as head of the resistance coalition, he will be required to 
issue statements denouncing the latest Cambodian reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pondering Deal 
</P>
<P>
But Sihanouk indicated that he is seriously considering a separate deal with 
the Hun Sen government that would allow him to return to Phnom Penh as head of 
state even if the proposals are rejected by his allies in the resistance, the 
Khmer Rouge and rightist followers of former Prime Minister Son Sann. 
</P>
<P>
Son Sann, who also met Hun Sen separately in Jakarta, later pronounced himself 
"very surprised" at Sihanouk's remarks. The Khmer Rouge did not participate in 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said he agreed to meet again with Hun Sen in Paris on July 24, to be 
followed the next day by a four-party meeting. In the meantime, he said he 
hopes that Hun Sen will make the required changes in the constitution that 
would enable him to participate in the government. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said he doubted that the Khmer Rouge would ever agree to compromise 
with Hun Sen. After they refuse, he said, there would be a tripartite 
government in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
Among the points of agreement announced by Hun Sen and Sihanouk were the 
creation of an "international control mechanism" to monitor the Vietnamese 
troop withdrawals and help monitor free elections. Sihanouk dropped his demand 
for a U.N. force, and agreed to allow the force to be chosen by an 
international conference, with two Western countries, two socialist countries 
and two nonaligned countries making up the force. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said he and Hun Sen agreed that after the complete withdrawal of 
Vietnamese troops, both sides would stop receiving arms supplies from outside 
powers. Asked if he would accept lethal aid from the United States, a move the 
Bush Administration is reportedly considering, the prince said his forces 
already have enough weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia until his ouster by a right-wing coup in 1970, 
said Hun Sen's government had made significant concessions in the new 
constitution by accepting the right of private property, a free market, foreign 
investment and the declaration of Buddhism as the state religion of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not so bad, my son Hun Sen," Sihanouk said. "He's not quite good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multi-Party System 
</P>
<P>
He said he was insisting that the constitution be further amended to remove Hun 
Sen's Marxist People's Revolutionary Party as the dominant political party and 
replace it with a Western-style multi-party system. Hun Sen said Tuesday that 
he would consider the change, adding that it seemed inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
The only stumbling block appeared to be Sihanouk's insistence that the Phnom 
Penh government be "reshaped" into a so-called four-party system of government. 
This apparently means Hun Sen must accept, in principle at least, the division 
of cabinet posts among the four parties, while keeping the existing civil 
service intact. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk tried to play down the changes he sought, comparing it to the way 
Paris dress designers modify an existing pattern -- "like Christian Dior" -- 
rather than scrapping a political system. 
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has vehemently refused to accept any suggestion that the Phnom Penh 
government be dismantled in advance of elections, saying that only the people 
can change the composition of their government. Whether he is prepared to 
compromise further by naming Sihanouk supporters to Cabinet posts is an open 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"If Hun Sen accepts, I will join my son," he said, referring to the Cambodian 
premier. "I will resign as president of Democratic Kampuchea," the name given 
to the coalition government-in-exile, "I will go to Phnom Penh as head of 
state." 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts believe that for Hun Sen, the prospect of Sihanouk returning 
to Cambodia without the Khmer Rouge would be a major triumph. While Sihanouk 
has little in the way of a national army to contribute, he has enormous 
prestige as the personification of Cambodia, he has international acceptability 
and his inclusion as head of state would make it almost impossible for the 
United States and other governments to continue withholding recognition from 
the Phnom Penh regime, ending the country's isolation. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Monday, when he met with Vice President Dan Quayle, Sihanouk had 
insisted on the need for including the Khmer Rouge in any settlement. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, however, Sihanouk denounced the Khmer Rouge as 
"criminal" and said that many of his relatives had been among those who 
perished during the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to early 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said he told Hun Sen not to worry about the possibility of the Khmer 
Rouge joining the new regime in Phnom Penh, a major concern of the current 
government, because "they want only one thing -- the continuation of the war." 
</P>
<P>
He said Hun Sen has received assurances from Thailand that the Khmer Rouge, 
whose forces operate out of base camps near the Thai-Cambodian border, would be 
restrained by the Thai military. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said he rejected Hun Sen's proposal to create a Supreme National 
Council, with representatives of each faction, as a compromise way of 
eliminating the four-party government. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said he would wait until October or November to decide about joining 
the government. By that time, he said, it will be clear that the Vietnamese 
have pulled out as they have promised and whether Hun Sen has met his 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SIHANOUK: LONG-EXILED LEADER 
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, 67, has agreed conditionally to return to Phnom Penh 
as Cambodia's head of state . . . he ruled Cambodia from 1941 to 1970, under 
Japan and then France and with a variety of titles, including king, prime 
minister and head of state. . . . He has lived abroad since his ouster in 1970

SOVIET TRADE UNIONS TO GET RIGHT TO STRIKE UNDER DRAFT LAW

Soviet trade unions, long closely controlled by Communist authorities, will be 
given the right to strike under a draft law to be adopted in the next few 
months, union leader Stepan Shalayev said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The draft law follows sporadic reports from across the country of wildcat 
strikes by miners, bus drivers and carpet weavers demanding better pay and 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad police officers demonstrated in the city center April 9 to back a 
series of demands, according to the newspaper Socialist Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Stoppages linked with nationalist unrest have paralyzed industry in Georgia, 
Armenia and Azerbaijan several times in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"The right (to strike) is being considered a means to press management to speed 
up the resolution of labor disputes," Shalayev said in an interview with the 
trade union paper Trud. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is an extreme measure which should be applied only in exceptional 
cases," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The draft law says: "A trade union committee . . . has the right to stop work 
at an enterprise in an organization when the procedure, established by law, of 
considering a labor dispute is being violated or when management does not live 
up to an agreement that has been reached."

TURNER TO RESIGN AS LIBERAL PARTY LEADER IN CANADA

John Turner, who led a dramatic but unsuccessful fight against Canada's free 
trade agreement with the United States, announced Wednesday that he is stepping 
down as leader of the opposition Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberals lost twice to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive 
Conservative Party since Turner took over the leadership in 1984. The most 
recent defeat was in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my intention to resign as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada at an 
appropriate time, after the national executive has chosen a date for a 
leadership convention," Turner said in a letter released at an Ottawa news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel regret that I was not able to accomplish the ultimate goal of a 
politician: To win an election and become prime minister," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, 59, inherited the prime minister's job in 1984 after Pierre Trudeau 
resigned, but Turner's term lasted only 79 days. He and the Liberals were 
ousted by Mulroney and the Conservatives in an election that left barely 40 
Liberals in the Commons. 
</P>
<P>
Much of his era as Liberal leader was marked by fierce internal battles within 
the party, which dominated Canadian politics for much of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, a lawyer, revived his own and his party's sagging fortunes with a 
persistent, emotional campaign against the free trade agreement that Mulroney 
signed with then-President Ronald Reagan in January, 1988.

PROSPECTS FOR GORBACHEV REFORMS? CHENEY BACKPEDALS SLIGHTLY

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, backpedaling a bit, said Wednesday that there is 
no "significant difference" between his and President Bush's views on the 
prospects for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney last week strayed from Administration policy and predicted in a 
television interview that Gorbachev would fail and be replaced by a hard-liner. 
No other government official had publicly offered such a gloomy assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, Cheney said 
that he spoke last week "perhaps with more candor than was warranted." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that his views remain "somewhat pessimistic" about Gorbachev's 
prospects, while Bush has expressed hope that the Soviet leader's reform 
program will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see those as conflicting or contradictory statements," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who appeared before the panel to discuss the Pentagon's budget 
proposal, said he had met with Bush on Tuesday and the two had "chuckled" at 
press reports of a split within the Administration on Gorbachev's future and 
how to respond to the Soviet leader's initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief insisted that the United States should not unilaterally cut 
its defense spending or trim its military forces until the ultimate direction 
of the Soviet Union under Gorbachev becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that as secretary of defense I can recommend to the nation 
that we ought to make fundamental adjustments in our policy or reallocation of 
our resources away from the military sector based upon what the fates might or 
might not have in store for Mr. Gorbachev and his reforms inside the Soviet 
Union," Cheney told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
A retired Soviet general, visiting the United States as part of a peace 
delegation, derided Cheney's opinions as "old thinking." 
</P>
<P>
"I have never heard that Mr. Cheney is an expert on the Soviet Union," Lt. Gen. 
Mikhail Milshtein, currently a military analyst at Moscow's Institute for the 
Study of the U.S.A. and Canada, said in an interview this week. "I doubt very 
much if Mr. Cheney really knows the political situation in Russia and the 
position of Mr. Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Cheney made his comments "for a purpose" -- to rationalize 
continued high levels of defense spending and to support Washington's cautious 
approach to arms control talks with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States, to justify anything in their military policy, has always 
presented the Soviet Union as the reason. Cheney talks of the possible fall of 
Gorbachev and says, 'Be careful,' " Milshtein, 78, said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious the United States needs a perestroika (restructuring) in its 
political and military thinking and it goes to people in the Pentagon 
especially," the general said, using Gorbachev's term for his efforts to 
reorient the Soviet economy. "It's about time for them to look at these 
problems from a different angle." 
</P>
<P>
Milshtein said that Gorbachev firmly controls power in the Kremlin, despite 
Cheney's observation that conservative elements who oppose his reforms 
ultimately are likely to oust him. "Some people are doubting, but the majority 
are supporting Gorbachev," Milshtein said. 
</P>
<P>
The general said that the Soviet Union is not only withdrawing troops and tanks 
from Eastern Europe, it is restructuring the remaining units "to give them a 
defensive character." He said the process is expected to take about two years.

WARHOL'S 'MARILYN MONROE' FETCHES RECORD $4 MILLION 
</P>

Like a wave in the high seas of a rising art market, an international crowd of 
contemporary art aficionados left Sotheby's in its wake and rolled on to 
Christie's Wednesday night to witness the opening of the second half of a 
series of big-ticket auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of about 1,200 was rewarded with a few moments of high drama when 
"Shot Red Marilyn," a vibrantly colored painting of Marilyn Monroe by Andy 
Warhol, brought $4 million from Kazuo Fujii, a Tokyo dealer. The quintessential 
Pop painting, from the collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Max Palevsky, 
was valued at $1.5 million to $2.5 million, but bidding soon soared past that 
figure. A few seconds later, the final bid passed the artist's record of $3.96 
million set last November. Applause burst out as Christopher Burge, Christie's 
president and auctioneer, brought down the gavel. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised. There was tremendous interest in the Warhol, but I just 
wanted it to set a record and it did," said Martha Baer, head of the auction 
house's contemporary art department. 
</P>
<P>
The 1964 painting bears an oft-repeated image in Warhol's work, but it has the 
distinction of being one of four "Shot" canvases, named for a shooting incident 
in the late artist's studio. "Shot Red Marilyn" was actually shot -- right 
between the eyes -- and repaired later. The canvas was in the collection of 
artist Robert Rauschenberg before Palevsky bought it at the Leo Castelli 
Gallery in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Another high point in the evening occured when Jasper Johns' tiny 
(12-inch-by-10 1/2-inch) canvas, called "Colored Alphabet," brought $3.5 
million from an unidentified European dealer. Burge almost knocked down the 
painting at around $2 million, but suddenly a cry rang out from the back of the 
crowded sale room indicating that another bidder had entered the competition. 
When the sale was complete, a man in the audience whipped out his pocket 
calculator and announced that the painting cost more than $25,000 per square 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such excitement, Wednesday night's numbers were not as big as 
Tuesday's. Christie's sold 60 artworks for a total of $31.76 million. That 
figure was well above the most optimistic estimate of $28.8 million but far 
less than Sotheby's record-setting $78.6-million sale of 103 items the previous 
evening. But most pieces offered at Christie's met or exceeded their estimates 
-- 15 of them setting records -- and only six lots failed to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two sales indicate the continuing strength of the contemporary 
art market, a riskier territory than older periods of art that have been 
securely established in history. While auction watchers often gasp at sharply 
escalating contemporary art prices, auction house experts insist that the 
market is behaving in a controlled manner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not berserk. It's just very, very strong," Berge said. 
</P>
<P>
One area of strength was seen Wednesday night in works by Abstract 
Expressionist Franz Kline, which twice broke his record of $2.3 million. No 
sooner did Kline's "August Day" sell for $2.75 million than "Scudera," said to 
be his last complete painting, brought $2.86 million from New York dealer Allan 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
A Jackson Pollock triptych from the Los Angeles collection of Stanley K. and 
Betty W. Sheinbaum, valued at $1.5 million to $2.5 million, sold for $2.2 
million to an anonymous American dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Lichtenstein's playful 1972 painting, "Things on the Wall," fetched its 
predicted price of $1 million from an unidentified American collector. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 records, three were claimed by well established women and all 
three sales roughly doubled estimates. Helen Frankenthaler's 1973 stained 
canvas, "Cravat," valued at $80,000 to $120,000, brought $220,000. Agnes 
Martin's pale striped painting, "Untitled 5," fetched $264,000 instead of the 
predicted price of $100,000 to $150,000. "King of Spades" by Joan Mitchell, an 
energetic abstraction valued at $180,000 to $250,000, commanded a price of 
$462,000. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the second part of Sotheby's contemporary art auction 
brought $19 million for 323 artworks, bringing the total for Sotheby's entire 
sale to $98.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's contemporary art sale continues today when 350 paintings, sculptures 
and drawings, valued at $6 million to $8 million, go under the gavel. 
</P>
<P>
Next week a new wave of art collector and dealers will roll into Manhattan for 
sales of Impressionist and modern art expected to total as much as $422 
million. Sotheby's will begin the new round of sales on Tuesday night and the 
following day. Christie's will take over on Wednesday evening and Thursday.

SEABROOK NUCLEAR PLANT MOVES STEP CLOSER TO LICENSE

Federal regulators on Wednesday removed a major obstacle to a low-power testing 
license for the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear plant, perhaps the biggest milestone in 
the 20-year history of the financially fragile reactor that is a decade behind 
schedule and billions over budget. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook could receive the long-sought permit, which allows testing at up to 5% 
of capacity, as early as late next week if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
does not impose a stay on the license pending court appeals. 
</P>
<P>
In the announcement on the decision, the commission's staff said it was 
satisfied the plant owners have properly guaranteed they could raise $72.1 
million to cover dismantling costs in case the reactor is tested with 
radioactive fuel but never operates commercially. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has said the financial decommissioning issue was the last in a 
long series of regulatory obstacles that has prevented Seabrook from getting 
its low-power license for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came just hours after the NRC voted 5 to 0 to reject a request by 
Massachusetts officials to hold new hearings on the license because New 
Hampshire does not have a place to dump low-level radioactive waste from the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC said in a March ruling that it would give opponents five days to file 
requests for a stay and another four days for Seabrook officials to respond. 
The order said the commissioners would rule on stay motions "expeditiously" and 
the license would not be issued until the commission has ruled on the requests. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is expected to challenge the license in 
federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
But any legal challenge will become moot without an emergency stay from either 
the NRC or the court because Seabrook officials are ready to act swiftly on 
low-power tests.

Invoking a sense of deja vu after last Friday's scrubbed launch attempt 31 
seconds before liftoff, NASA officials said Wednesday that all problems had 
been corrected on the orbiter Atlantis and that it is ready for launch this 
morning at 10:48 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are again and we are ready to fly again," said NASA's newly nominated 
head, Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineers will have a 64-minute "window" in which to launch Atlantis, 
which is carrying the $325-million Magellan probe that is designed to map the 
surface of Venus with radar. That is more than twice the 23-minute window that 
was available last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But meteorologists said that there is a 40% chance the launch will be scrubbed 
because of weather constraints. The potential threats to the mission include a 
chance of low-level clouds that would impede landing of the orbiter at Kennedy 
if the mission were aborted after liftoff, a possibility of prohibitive 
crosswinds at the Kennedy landing site and a slight chance of rain showers that 
would block the launch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poor Weather 
</P>
<P>
If the launch is scrubbed today, said Capt. Thomas Strange, an Air Force 
meteorologist, the chance that weather would block a launch on Friday is also 
about 40%. The possibility of poor weather rises to 50% on Saturday and 70% on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday's attempted launch was scrubbed when computers detected a power 
surge in a pump that cools one of the shuttle's three main engines before 
launch. NASA engineers replaced the pump this week, but a close inspection 
showed that it had not been damaged, according to Arnold D. Aldrich, director 
of the National Space Transportation System. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians found metal particles and shavings, ranging in size from 10 
thousandths of an inch to 40 thousandths of an inch, in the pump, but "no signs 
of interior scraping or wear," Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
He speculated that, in an "extremely unlikely event," one of the metal shavings 
short-circuited two electrical leads, blowing a circuit breaker. The resulting 
power surge apparently vaporized the piece of metal (which was probably 
solder), and the pump would have been functional if engineers could have reset 
the circuit breaker, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers this week also replaced a 4-inch-wide liquid hydrogen line through 
which the super-cold fuel is returned to the shuttle's external fuel tank after 
it is used to cool the engines. Observations of videotapes taken after the 
scrubbed launch suggested that the line had developed a leak in its external 
covering, allowing air to leak into the liquid-argon insulating line 
surrounding the hydrogen line. 
</P>
<P>
But inspection of the line showed no leak. Further studies suggested that a 
cavity in the solid insulation of the line had allowed air to condense while 
hydrogen was flowing through the line. When the cooling pump shut down, the 
line warmed up, evaporating the air and creating the visible plume that 
technicians observed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither problem endangered the shuttle or the astronauts, Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
The five crew members -- commander David M. Walker, pilot Ronald J. Grabe and 
mission specialists Norman E. Thagard, Mary L. Cleave and Mark C. Lee -- 
returned to the space center from Houston on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they were 
reported to be flying T-38 trainers for relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
NASA has until May 28 to launch the Magellan probe, the first interplanetary 
probe the United States has launched in 11 years and the first ever launched by 
the Shuttle. If it is not launched by then, the agency will have to wait two 
years for Earth and Venus to again be in the proper alignment for a minimum 
energy trajectory.

CAVAZOS CITES SCORES, SAYS U.S. EDUCATION IS STAGNATING

American education is stagnating by nearly every measure in a new comparison of 
school performance across the country, Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos 
said Wednesday as he released the sixth annual State Education Performance 
Chart. 
</P>
<P>
The chart shows a decline in the national high school graduation rate and 
falling scores on college entrance exams in half the states. 
</P>
<P>
"We must do better," Cavazos said in a statement. "We must revitalize education 
in America. I am challenging states and districts to establish education 
improvement targets." 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos said that he would write every governor, state schools chief and school 
board president in the country to urge them to adopt his targets, which include 
boosting high school graduation rates to 90% and cutting in half the number of 
children who fail a grade. 
</P>
<P>
"These goals are doable," he said. "We must focus not on the minimum, but on 
the best." 
</P>
<P>
The controversial performance chart, known as the wall chart, shows a general 
lack of progress despite the continuing spate of improvement efforts and 
ever-rising education spending -- up to $3,977 per student in 1987, compared to 
$3,756 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
National scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test fell from 906 to 904, on a 
scale of 400 to 1,600, from 1987 to 1988. Fully 14 of the 22 states in which 
the SAT is the dominant college entrance exam registered declines. 
</P>
<P>
Scores on the American College Testing Program, on a scale of 1 to 36, showed a 
scant 0.1-point gain. And 11 of the 28 states in which the ACT dominates posted 
decreases. 
</P>
<P>
The high school graduation rate rose from 69.5% in the first chart to 71.7% in 
1985. But it fell slightly in 1986 to 71.6% and dropped to 71.1% in 1987, the 
latest year for which statistics could be calculated. 
</P>
<P>
In California, however, the average SAT score rose two points to 908, tying for 
fourth place with Connecticut and Maryland among the states. New Hampshire, 
Oregon and Vermont had the highest SAT scores. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the state's SAT scores, California Supt. of Public Instruction Bill 
Honig challenged Cavazos' conclusion that schools have stagnated as "highly 
misleading" and "inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
Honig said that the federal government's performance chart fails to take into 
account the substantial increases in the number of students taking the 
college-entrance exam. In California, he said, 50% more seniors took the exam 
in 1987 than in 1982, when the first performance chart was issued. A rise in 
the number of test-takers normally drives scores down, he said, but in 
California the scores have gone up. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not stagnation," Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
The California schools chief also criticized the chart's focus on college-bound 
students and dropouts. "That's maybe half the kids," he said. "The other 50%, 
the average kids, don't show up on this chart." 
</P>
<P>
The performance chart showed little change in California's 1987 high school 
graduation rate of 66.1%, which was 0.6% lower than in 1986. Since 1982, the 
state's graduation rate has increased by 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota ranked first with a high school completion rate of 90.6%, while the 
District of Columbia was last at 55.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at trends since the first wall chart was issued in 1982, one bright 
note was a continuous rise in the percentage of students taking the Advanced 
Placement test qualifying them for college credit, from 5% to 11%. The 
department attributed the climb largely to doubled Latino involvement and an 
83% increase in participation by blacks.

Hailstorms that battered wide areas of southwest Sichuan province over a 10-day 
period killed 157 people and injured 6,000, the newspaper China Daily said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The storms, which hit 105 of the province's 175 counties from April 20 through 
last week, also destroyed 170,000 houses, the English-language newspaper said. 
Earlier reports had put the death toll from the storms at 87.

PANEL OKS BILLS ON USE OF PROP. 99 FUNDS

With Republican support, lawmakers on the Senate Health and Human Services 
Committee on Wednesday passed three key bills opposed by Gov. George Deukmejian 
that are aimed at dividing up much of the money raised by Proposition 99, the 
tobacco tax initiative. 
</P>
<P>
With each of the bills getting a unanimous vote, legislators moved a step 
closer to an open clash with the Republican governor over how to spend the 
estimated $625 million that is expected from Proposition 99 during the upcoming 
budget year. 
</P>
<P>
The three bills acted upon Wednesday are part of a legislative package put 
together by Coalition for a Healthy California, sponsors of the initiative 
measure approved by voters last November. In all, about 40 different bills have 
been introduced aimed at implementing various parts of Proposition 99. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99 raised the tax on cigarettes 25 cents a pack and imposed 
comparable tax increases on pipe tobacco, cigars and other tobacco products. 
During the first three months of the year, $142.2 million in Proposition 99 tax 
revenues was collected, according to the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
None of the money can be spent until the governor and Legislature reach 
agreement on how the funds will be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian in January proposed spending the bulk of the money to finance 
ongoing state health, recreation and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, including a number of Republican legislators, attacked the governor's 
plan as possibly illegal and argued that it violated the spirit of Proposition 
99. The initiative specifically called for the money to be spent on 
smoking-related health and education programs. There was a provision saying 
that the money was not to be used to replace state budget dollars already being 
spent on programs. 
</P>
<P>
One of the measures approved Wednesday, by Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), 
chairwoman of the committee, calls tobacco use "the single most important 
source of preventable disease and premature death in California." The bill 
would appropriate between $120 million and $150 million annually to 
anti-smoking education campaigns. It passed on a 6-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospital Funds 
</P>
<P>
Another bill, by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benecia), would appropriate $324 million 
over the current and upcoming budget years to hospitals to help defray the 
costs of providing care to indigent patients. It was approved 7 to 0, with two 
Republicans joining five Democrats in voting for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99, supported by the California Medical Assn. and other health 
organizations, provided that a share of the tobacco tax receipts go to doctors 
and hospitals to help defray health costs. 
</P>
<P>
The third bill to receive approval, appropriating $65 million annually to 
reimburse physicians who treat indigent patients, is being carried by Sen. John 
Seymour (R-Anaheim), one of the GOP lawmakers who believes that the governor's 
proposal violates the spirit of Proposition 99. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said the bill, which passed 7 to 0, "just codifies in statute what was 
intended by Proposition 99." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), one of two Republican members of 
the committee who voted for the bills, said Deukmejian still has not entered 
the negotiations on Proposition 99. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just kind of treading water right now," Campbell said. "The governor 
always has the ability to veto anything we do, so obviously he holds the blue 
chip down there." 
</P>
<P>
The other Republican voting for the bills was Sen. Edward R. Royce of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
So far, state officials are uncertain over just how much money will be 
available as a result of the tobacco tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, budget writers expected Proposition 99 to generate about $300 
million during the last six months of the current fiscal year, which ends June 
30. But word filtering out of the Board of Equalization is that the estimate 
was too optimistic, and state officials now expect to receive less than $300 
million.

Two Czechoslovak dissidents, jailed since last October, were released Wednesday 
after an appeals court upheld their original suspended sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The court rejected a prosecutor's appeal against 10-month suspended sentences 
imposed March 17 on Hana Marvanova and Tomas Dvorak, co-founders of the 
Independent Peace Assn. It ordered their immediate release. 
</P>
<P>
Dvorak, 24, and Marvanova, 26, were accused of sedition in connection with a 
banned rally last August marking the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led 
invasion and a similar gathering marking the 70th anniversary of independence 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
The rallies were broken up by riot police with truncheons and dogs.

SHERIFF'S AIDES ASSAIL HIM FOR ACTIONS IN SALCIDO CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff Dick Michaelsen is being criticized by some members of his staff for 
his handling of the Ramon Salcido case, including charges that he may have 
aided the suspected mass killer's defense, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations are made in a letter drafted and approved by about 80% of the 
Sonoma County Sheriff's Department's management staff and a small number of 
deputies, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is scheduled to be considered by the executive board of the Sonoma 
County Sheriff's Employees Assn. on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the letter said Michaelsen's public statements contributed 
to hysteria in the community, violated basic investigatory practices and may 
have aided the defense by lending credence to the proposition that Salcido is 
insane. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said "a series of behaviors" by the sheriff were "inappropriate, 
irresponsible and unprofessional." 
</P>
<P>
The letter attacked Michaelsen's announcement at a news conference that two of 
the victims, both of whom were Salcido's sisters-in-law, had been sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than some vague physical circumstances at the crime scene, there existed 
no proof" of sexual assault, the letter charged. 
</P>
<P>
The letter says that Michaelsen's announcement violated "rudimentary police 
investigative practices" by releasing information that only the killer was 
likely to know. 
</P>
<P>
Further comments during press conferences by Michaelsen that the suspected 
slayer must have been "insane" and "psychotic" caused resentment among 
department members. 
</P>
<P>
"He's helping build their defense," one law official told the Press Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
The official's opinion is reflected in the draft letter. 
</P>
<P>
"The term(s) psychotic and insane have specific psychiatric and legal meanings. 
Sheriff Michaelsen is not a psychologist or psychiatrist and is not in any 
position to offer an authoritative opinion as to the psychological state of 
suspects." 
</P>
<P>
Salcido, 28, is charged with seven counts of murder and three counts of 
attempted murder. He fled but was captured in his native Mexico and brought 
back to Santa Rosa.

REACTOR START-UP TO BE OKD DESPITE DISCOVERY OF BROKEN BOLTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Wednesday that there is 
no danger in restarting a reactor at the San Onofre nuclear power plant, 
despite the discovery of three broken bolts in the supports that hold up its 
"thermal shield." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Cook, public affairs officer for the NRC's Western office, said the NRC is 
prepared to allow the start-up of reactor unit No. 1 if Southern California 
Edison submits written documents agreeing to conditions worked out in a meeting 
between the utility and the NRC Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"With those conditions in place, staff is confident that the reactor will be 
safe to operate," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cook characterized statements by an Edison spokesman that the NRC 
already has approved the start-up as "slightly premature." Edison spokesman Lew 
Phelps said Tuesday that "all safety issues have been resolved, and we would 
not consider restarting the plant if that were not the case." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council, reacting to news accounts of the damaged bolts, 
approved an emergency resolution Tuesday urging the NRC not to permit the 
start-up of the reactor "until all questions regarding its safety have been 
been resolved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worst-Case Scenario' 
</P>
<P>
The council sent telegrams to Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, 
co-owners of the San Onofre plant, and urged Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) to 
intervene with the NRC to prevent the start-up of the reactor. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, written by Mayor Maureen O'Connor's staff, asserts that "in a 
worst-case scenario (envisioned by NRC staff)" the broken bolts "could cause 
the shield to drop to the bottom of the reactor, affecting the flow of cooling 
water around the reactor core itself." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said, however, that, in a "worst conceivable scenario," the thermal shield 
could drop just 11 inches, causing "an extremely minor difference in the way 
water enters the core. It wouldn't be a major enough difference to be 
detectable." 
</P>
<P>
Three broken bolts have been discovered among the 36 that are connected to six 
supports that hold up the thermal shield, Cook said. The shield protects the 
pressure vessel surrounding the reactor core from radiation that, over time, 
makes the vessel more brittle. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said it is "almost certain" that some of the other 22-year-old bolts in 
the reactor are "degraded" and "cracked." But, if Edison submits written 
acceptance of the three conditions, the NRC is prepared to allow start-up of 
the reactor, he said. The reactor is capable of producing enough electricity to 
serve 400,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Edison must agree to increased monitoring of the vibrations affecting the 
thermal shield and a special June, 1990, inspection of the supports and bolts, 
Cook said. It also must negotiate how the special inspection will be conducted, 
he said.

BATTERY ALLEGEED IN DEPROGRAMMING ABDUCTION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three people who said they were knocked to the ground when they tried to keep a 
friend from being abducted in a deprogramming effort two weeks ago filed a 
battery complaint Wednesday against their alleged assailants. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint stems from an incident April 20 when Dina Geerlings, 37, was 
forced into a car in a parking lot by three men near where she works in 
Clairemont Mesa as a clothes designer. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police say Geerlings' family has told them they have successfully 
deprogrammed her from her allegiance to a Bible study group that they claim is 
a cult. 
</P>
<P>
But Detective David Morris said Wednesday that, although he has talked to a 
woman by telephone whom he believes to be Geerlings, he has not yet talked to 
her face to face. Geerlings, according to Morris, said she does not want to 
press kidnaping charges against her abductors and is now in seclusion out of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Morris said he hopes to meet early next week with the woman to confirm her 
position. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Wednesday, three members of Great Among the Nations, that they describe 
as a fundamental Bible study and evangelism ministry, took their own offensive. 
In a misdemeanor complaint filed with police, they and a witness alleged they 
suffered sprains and abrasions when they tried to intervene in Geerlings' 
abduction. 
</P>
<P>
The three -- Melva Davenport, Camilla Vieux and Terri Hill -- along with a 
fourth member, Theresa Maynard, who said she witnessed the confrontation, said 
in the 
</P>
<P>
complaint that they ran toward the vehicle where three men were trying to force 
Geerlings inside. 
</P>
<P>
"They said three big guys pushed them away and knocked a couple of them on the 
ground, pushing them back so they wouldn't interfere with the rescue attempt," 
said Morris. 
</P>
<P>
He said their complaint would be forwarded to the San Diego city attorney's 
office for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The women's complaint identified only one alleged assailant: Joe Elichaa, the 
brother of Geerlings. The other two men were described to Morris as "6-foot-5 
and 240 pounds, big arms and big, husky shoulders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a misdemeanor, and we can't make an arrest if it's not committed in our 
presence," Morris said. He said it is up to the city attorney on whether to 
purse the matter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talked to Father 
</P>
<P>
Morris said he has not talked to Joe Elichaa about the abduction, but has 
talked to Geerlings' father, David Elichaa. "He wouldn't admit to any 
involvement in the snatching," Morris said. "He said he wanted it done, but he 
didn't want to incriminate himself, I'm sure. He has assured me she was OK." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said that, in his conversation with the woman claiming to be Geerlings, 
"She said she didn't want to talk too much. She just wanted to be left alone. 
She didn't sound like she was being forced into telling me these things. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you feel when you come out of something like that, like a 
light switch popping. She said she doesn't want to be bothered by anybody. She 
only called me so I wouldn't arrest her family." 
</P>
<P>
Geerling's abduction is the second in a year involving the group. Last year, 
member Ginger Brown was taken. Her parents and sister along with two other 
people are scheduled to appear at a preliminary hearing Monday in Vista 
Municipal Court. Brown, who was released four days after her abduction and 
returned to the group, will be the chief prosecution witness against the 
five.The prosecutor in that case said he is concerned about the handling of the 
Geerlings' investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel said that, since Geerlings hasn't been seen yet 
by police, a full two weeks after her abduction, "I have to assume she's being 
brainwashed, and that it's an ongoing process, since she still hasn't had a 
face-to-face contact with the investigator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Voice 
</P>
<P>
"Members of the ministry have told me Dina Geerlings has a sister with a 
similar voice, and there's no way to authenticate the person who called the 
detective is the same person who was abducted," Rempel said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have concern for her well-being," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Altschul, leader of the Coronado-based Great Among the Nations, said 
Wednesday he has not talked to Geerlings since the abduction. "My conclusion is 
that she is still drugged or shocked, and that if she personally spoke to the 
authorities, she would cry out and say she was being held against her will. We 
don't know where she is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retrieved Belongings 
</P>
<P>
Altschul said David Elichaa has picked up Geerlings' personal belongings from 
the group's apartments in La Jolla "and, according to him, she will never see 
us again. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot in stake with how this turns out," Altschul said of Elichaa. "If 
they do not succeed in keeping her, then they would likely go to jail for 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised if one day she shows up here again," Altschul said. 
"She may decide to do different things with her life, but I have a hard time 
believing she is so afraid of us she cannot still call and say hello to us."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ACCUSED OF 'BOILER-ROOM' SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Monica man has been charged in Utah with running a telephone "boiler 
room" that used promises of discount vacations to defraud credit-card holders. 
</P>
<P>
The two-count complaint alleges that Edward Kane was among several people who 
from June through August of 1984 helped manage Sunsets Unlimited, a Utah-based 
travel club in reorganization bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
To sell club memberships, Salt Lake City Prosecutor William Ryan said, Kane 
helped set up a boiler room office "equipped with multiple telephone hookups 
and a sales staff of telephone solicitors." According to the complaint, Kane 
instructed the phone solicitors to seek out major credit-card holders as 
customers and obtain their card numbers "by means of various 
misrepresentations." 
</P>
<P>
The victims were allegedly told that they would receive a package of materials 
including a "valuable discount coupon book for reduced rates at major hotels, 
restaurants, car rentals agencies and tourist attractions." But Kane knew, the 
complaint said, that Sunsets Unlimited was systematically charging $149 to the 
credit-card accounts as soon as the number was obtained, "irrespective of 
whether the customer had agreed to become a member."

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police and the federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration are investigating the death last Friday of an employee of a 
Wilmington cargo container storage yard who was killed when a 5,000-pound empty 
container fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Martin, president of Martin Container Service, said that Adrian Jacinto, 
22, of Wilmington died after a locking device on the top of a container 
loosened and the container fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he did not know why the lock released. He declined to say what 
Jacinto, a container repairman, was doing, other than to say that Jacinto was 
on duty at the time the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Jacinto had never had an accident at work during the year he 
worked for Martin Container and that no other employee has been killed at the 
yard in the 14 years the firm has been in operation. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that Jacinto is survived by his wife, who is pregnant, and by a 
young child.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANOTHER EMERGENCY ROOM MAY BE SHUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wave of threatened closures of hospital emergency rooms in Inglewood and 
Hawthorne to patients who are transported by ambulance could spread to another 
South Bay hospital, this time in Gardena, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to hold out as long as possible," Gardena Memorial Hospital 
Administrator Phyllis Van Crombrugghe told a recent community forum at 
Inglewood City Hall. "The problem must be solved, or our hospital will have to 
downgrade as well." 
</P>
<P>
Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood and Robert F. Kennedy Medical 
Center in Hawthorne recently announced plans to downgrade their emergency 
rooms. They will no longer accept patients delivered by paramedics. Both cite 
major financial losses from treating poor, indigent or uninsured patients. 
</P>
<P>
James D. Grant, director of emergency services at Gardena Memorial, said the 
small for-profit community hospital has seen a 25% increase in emergency room 
patients in the last year as other hospitals have closed their doors to 
paramedics or reached the saturation point.

<P>
San Diego's first park ranger has a formidable task. 
</P>
<P>
Unarmed and still without a radio to summon backup help, the man police have 
nicknamed "The Lone Ranger" is trying to protect and enhance 5,700-acre Mission 
Trails Regional Park, which historically has been little more than a dumping 
ground and as much an off-roaders' haven as a naturalist's preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Trails can be a rough-and-tumble place. For instance, state Department 
of Fish and Game officials respond year-round to reports of hunters in the park 
"spotlighting" deer, or shining powerful lights into the animals' eyes to stun 
them so they can be more easily shot. 
</P>
<P>
Police continue to cite drivers of off-road vehicles, which often scar the 
terrain and erode the hillsides irreparably. And, in remote areas of the park, 
target shooting and beer drinking are a regular, volatile mix. 
</P>
<P>
The city's response to these problems? Ranger Randy Hawley. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley, a 36-year-old with a degree in recreation administration and park 
management from San Diego State University, has one of the largest beats of any 
peacekeeper in the city. Officials believe Mission Trails, which lies on the 
city's eastern edge between Tierrasanta, Santee and San Carlos, is the largest 
urban park in the country. It is more than six times the size of Central Park 
in New York and five times the size of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
Rife with rabbits, rattlesnakes and rodents, the city's last sizable chunk of 
wild land includes the Fortuna Mountain area, Cowles Mountain and Lake Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, whose 7th District includes the Mission Trails, 
successfully argued last July during budget negotiations that the city should 
fund a ranger to police the park and lead education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley began to patrol the dry expanses nearly three months ago. For now, the 
enthusiastic and affable ranger spends less time hounding the lawless amid the 
chaparral than he does shuffling paper work in his City Heights office. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawley intends to spend more time -- he now spends three or four hours a 
day -- combing the hills and canyons in his four-wheel-drive truck, as soon as 
he gets a handle on his administrative duties. Besides defining the jobs of 
five future rangers who will patrol city parks, he is coordinating a growing 
posse of volunteers who want to help clean up Mission Trails. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people I've met up with in the area are disgusted with the way the 
park has been used in the past, and want to do anything they can to make sure 
this remains a real park," Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
Sections of the park's northern edge that abut Tierrasanta are littered with 
household rubbish and the remnants of nearby housing construction, including 
tons of torn-up concrete curbing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officers from the Police Department are training Hawley, who has 
jurisdiction over misdemeanors in the park, to handle the common offenses: 
off-road vehicle use, dumping, poaching, shooting and narcotics use. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Dennis Sadler heads the department's Mission Trails Regional 
Park enforcement team and is in charge of training Hawley. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler, whose enforcement team has operated on weekends from April through 
September since 1985, thinks it's "ludicrous" for Hawley to police the park 
unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery of mutilated animals atop Cowles Mountain in early April 
led police to believe that satanic cult activity may have returned to the park. 
A pentagram was found burned into the top of Fortuna Mountain in September 
after many reports of bonfires were received, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the kind of characters Hawley can expect to meet in the park, 
Sadler offered a personal story of a close call last June. 
</P>
<P>
During an afternoon patrol in the Fortuna Mountain area, Sadler and his partner 
-- police always patrol the park in pairs -- came across a man with a World War 
II-type submachine gun who "was having a good time (shooting) and was a little 
bit high." While the officers were arresting him for possession of narcotics 
and an automatic weapon, the man "indicated he would have got us if we hadn't 
got to him first," Sadler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the kinds of nuts we have out there," he said, adding that the man 
killed himself the day before his preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Police statistics show that 44 guns were impounded in the park on weekends 
during the springs and summers of 1986 and 1987. (Statistics for 1988 were not 
available.) 
</P>
<P>
"We've told the parks department that it's ludicrous to have (Hawley) out there 
with no gun and no radio," Sadler said, adding that police "never go out alone 
in high-risk areas . . . and we always take automatic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
But Hawley, knowing well that the park is frequented by an ornery lot 
associated with off-road vehicles, alcohol, drugs and guns, said he doesn't 
miss the .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson he carried for eight years as a state 
park ranger elsewhere in the county. He is, however, looking forward to getting 
a radio in his truck to summon police backup. The radio is due anytime. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more concerned with getting bit by a rattlesnake or twisting my ankle and 
not being able to get help out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be able to justify that guns (for city park rangers) are not 
necessary. If the police are going to be able to respond to the serious 
situations, then I'm going to have to rely on my good judgment to keep myself 
out of those situations." 
</P>
<P>
The city would prefer that its rangers act as educators and practice 
"interpretive law enforcement" rather than be track-'em-down lawmen, Hawley 
said, adding that he is more interested in persuading people that the park is 
worth preserving than in writing citations. 
</P>
<P>
Convincing park abusers of the need for preservation is one of the most 
challenging aspects of his job, he said. The park's plant life -- which 
includes chaparral, wild artichokes and, along the streams, sycamores, coastal 
live oaks and willows -- is a far cry from the verdant, wooded preserves that 
many people associate with parkland. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawley believes that his friendly attitude with offenders, coupled with 
weekend police patrols and his own weekday presence in the park, are already 
paying off. Shooting, dumping and off-road vehicle use has waned since he began 
his patrols in February, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that, as the number of park-goers explodes in the summer months -- a 
couple of thousand visit on weekends -- they will continue to clamp down on 
illicit activity. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sadler says he is uneasy. Although weekend patrols have so far buffered 
the effects of the lawless on families, he recommends that park visitors "have 
fun but keep your eyes open." 
</P>
<P>
A "Baja buggy" being pursued by Sadler and his partner one weekend last year 
nearly ran over two children playing in the water near the San Diego River, 
which runs below the winding, two-lane Padre Junipero Serra Trail. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good potential for a serious accident out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Leonard, an electrical engineer who lives in San Carlos, frequently jogs in 
neighboring Mission Trails. 
</P>
<P>
"The town is getting overcrowded," said Leonard, a member of Friends of the 
Mission Trails Regional Park and a resident of the county for 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
"County and city (officials) intend to try to restrict growth rather than 
trying to accommodate it, but you can't restrict the people coming here," he 
said. "A place like this gives you somewhere to get away from all the people 
and traffic for a little bit." 
</P>

DANGER IS ALWAYS PART OF THE JOB AT ONE OF CITY'S BUSIEST FIRE STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Ralph Haynes was 3 years old, his house burned to the ground the day after 
Christmas. Ever since, he says, he has wanted to put out fires. 
</P>
<P>
Now 34, Haynes is a captain with the San Diego Fire Department at Station 12 in 
East San Diego, the second busiest station in the city and the first to request 
bulletproof vests because of the numbers of shootings and stabbings in its 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The station, at Imperial Avenue and Ozark Street, receives an average of about 
15 calls a day, ranging from heart attacks and structure fires to fuel spills 
and false alarms, firefighters say. But occasionally, there is that rare, slow 
day when they can relax. 
</P>
<P>
On one 24-hour shift last week, there were only three calls in which 
firefighters actually had to extinguish flames. It was an atypical shift, but 
to most it provided welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," said Firefighter Bill Nelson over a pasta salad lunch that 
day. "It's kind of nice. We haven't slept more than three hours (at a stretch) 
in over two months. We just haven't had a break." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Station 12 answered more than 4,500 calls, most of them requests for 
medical aid. But most calls last Wednesday were either canceled or handled by 
paramedics who arrived at the scene first. 
</P>
<P>
The day began for the station's eight firefighters, two paramedics and 
Battalion Chief Craig Black with an 8 a.m. meeting. Coffee brewed as Capt. Bill 
Bagnell ran through a schedule for the 24-hour shift, including a training 
video presentation at 3 p.m. and truck evaluations the next day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tacos for Dinner 
</P>
<P>
Lunch and dinner money dropped noisily into a metal box as Firefighter Ron 
Calkins, the unofficial station cook, announced tacos for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Calkins and Engineer Russ Steppe then tested equipment as part of their daily 
chores. They topped off the gasoline in chain saws and practiced starting up 
the Jaws of Life, a hydraulic compression tool often used for cutting tops off 
cars to free people trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
"We get it just the way we like it. It's real important that this doesn't break 
down on you," Calkins said. "And you want to be able to start equipment up when 
it's pitch black outside." 
</P>
<P>
Next came a "code 9" or mandatory exercise in nearby Martin Luther King Jr. 
Memorial Park on Skyline Drive. Dropping dark blue uniform trousers to reveal 
official SDFD running shorts, pairs of matching firefighters walked around the 
park. Some ran a few laps. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., the park was empty. But the place would be teeming at night. "This 
is an unusual neighborhood. You can be out at 2 in the morning, and it looks 
like 3 in the afternoon there are so many people," Bagnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes looked around him before a brief jog. "I live in this area. My church is 
in this area. . . . I like the activity. We saved a guy's house the other day 
and he was affiliated with my church." 
</P>
<P>
The entire neighborhood was visible when Bagnell and Calkins tested the fire 
truck's elevating platform, sometimes called the snorkel. The two of them were 
carried 70 feet in the air in a matter of seconds in a basket used for rescues 
and dumping water onto flames. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the firefighters split up, those with the engine, also known as 
the pump, off to practice drills; the others headed for Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were only three things on Calkins' list -- Diet Slice, bottled 
water and oranges -- he left the supermarket with $52.45 worth of food. One by 
one, tortillas, onions, oranges, lettuce, mushrooms, avocados and tomatoes were 
placed in the cart. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere between the milk and bagels, William Erhard Jr., 4, came up to 
Bagnell with an outstretched hand. "He wants to be a firefighter when he grows 
up," his mother confided. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sketchy Details 
</P>
<P>
At the station, Calkins dished up a massive bowl of pasta salad and garlic 
bread. The men settled down in the TV room to eat. At 12:43 p.m. came the first 
call of the day. A fuel spill on Interstate 805, north of Market. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters are notoriously fast eaters, said Nelson, as he wolfed down garlic 
bread, because their meals are interrupted so often. 
</P>
<P>
Sketchy details of the spill were transmitted first over a pager system and on 
a ticker-tape machine mounted in the garage, then over a loudspeaker. The 
firefighters suited up quickly but without any appearance of urgency, as if 
they had done so hundreds of times before. Bagnell checked the wall map for the 
fastest route. 
</P>
<P>
Sirens blared so loudly that the firefighters wore earphones against the noise. 
The speedometer read about 45 to 50 m.p.h. as the engine rolled. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel spill turned out to be a badly smashed, abandoned BMW by the side of 
the road. Fuel was not leaking and there were no injuries. Paramedics at the 
scene said a man was seen running from the car over a nearby hill, and 
firefighters suspected the brand-new car was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Scarcely was the engine back at Imperial and Ozark when Nelson spotted a grass 
fire. Both the engine and the truck responded, but the fire turned out to be 
minor and was quickly controlled. "That was easy," said Engineer Dan Goebel. 
</P>
<P>
For Goebel, the work is truly in his blood. His uncle came on the department in 
1929 and stayed for 43 years. His brother went through the first stage of fire 
academy with him. And his cousin is now a battalion chief. 
</P>
<P>
Steppe, who came on in 1982, remembered wanting to be a firefighter so badly 
that he slept outside the academy for four nights when registration lines began 
forming early that year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet Afternoon 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Steppe said, he had been on almost every kind of call, ranging from 
the proverbial cat in the tree to a woman stuck in her bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
One woman who lives about seven blocks south of the station has called the Fire 
Department 23 times in two months, mostly with medical complaints. Her address 
and a running tally were on a blackboard in the TV room and the firefighters 
know her so well they call her by her first name. 
</P>
<P>
After the grass fire, the afternoon was quiet. On slow days like this, said 
Bagnell, the men usually conduct business inspections for fire violations or 
canyon rim inspections, or drive around getting to know their district. 
</P>
<P>
"They still have a full day of work out for them. It's no more playing checkers 
in the station." 
</P>
<P>
Getting to know the district means knowing where every fire hydrant is and 
knowing on which side of any given street the odd-numbered houses are, Goebel 
said. "This time of day, is the traffic bad? Can I make the turn on this alley? 
There's one hill where, if you don't go fast enough, you can't make it up the 
next one." 
</P>
<P>
After the grass fire there were eight more calls, but most were minor. A 
"medical unknown," or body reported to be on the street, turned out to be a man 
sleeping on the sidewalk. In two other cases, a boy who fell from his 
skateboard and a woman who had difficulty breathing were treated by paramedics 
already at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight, however, the CHP reported a car fire on eastbound 
California 94. The firefighters used a hand fire extinguisher to put out the 
flames. Forty minutes later there was another car fire, this one "fully 
involved," and putting it out required all 500 gallons of water in the engine. 
Haynes suspected the car was stolen and the fire set deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, Bagnell said, "we never sleep all night. If you get to sleep 
four or five straight hours, that is an excellent night." 
</P>
<P>
Bagnell said gang activity in the area spurred him to request bulletproof vests 
about six months ago. Most of the gangs members were merely "wanna-be's" who 
fought over drugs, not turf, he said. "Almost all the shootings we go to are 
gang-related. When I was pushing to get ballistic body armor, at the time, 
there was an average of six to eight shootings a month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vests are donned at the discretion of the captain. When a call is 
identified as a medical unknown, often it is a stabbing or shooting victim and 
firefighters will put their vests on as they wait about a block from the scene 
for a go-ahead from the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Activity 
</P>
<P>
"We've had them for about six months," said Bagnell. "There's certain areas of 
the district where we put them on automatically, where there (are gangs) or 
something." Late night calls to unknown areas also trigger the order to wear 
the vests. 
</P>
<P>
Only three stations -- 12, 17 and 19 -- have the vests, but the department is 
considering ordering them for all firefighters, Chief John Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody calls in to 911 and says there's been a car accident, there's 
been stabbing, there's been a shooting, there's a fight going on, the first 
thing they do is call the Fire Department." Firefighters are often the first 
ones there, Hale said. "Statistics show we had more shootings and stabbings and 
those types of activities, and our employees had been there frequently before 
the situation was under control," so the firefighters were provided with the 
vests, said Hale. 
</P>
<P>
The activity, and the many calls at Station 12 can take their toll. "If you 
lived every tragedy that you go to as a firefighter, you'd be crazy in a 
month," Bagnell said. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent this, the San Diego Fire Department has contracted with Sharp 
Memorial Hospital for a team of counselors -- known as the critical incidents 
stress debriefing team -- who are available if firefighters want to talk about 
a particularly bad call. 
</P>
<P>
"I was with a firefighter one time, an excellent firefighter, and a female 
bicyclist had been run over by a trash truck. He came up and said, 'I can't 
handle this one,' " Bagnell said. "Those kind of calls you get a big lump in 
your throat. Everybody has a different level of stress." 
</P>
<P>
The toughest thing, according to Steppe, is to see a fire go bad. "To watch 
guys rushing to get out, the emotions of knowing someone's trapped inside . . . 
or when something happens to a fellow firefighter. We're usually out there 
helping people, and to be on the other end receiving help is kind of 
traumatic."

'ROAD HAZARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Road Hazard," April 14) on the Automobile Club of Southern 
California and its failure to provide the necessary instruction to assist a 
motorist in distress is one more confirmation of an uncaring, negligent 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
For years as a member, I have been begging the club to provide appropriate 
decals, emblems, or numbers for disabled members. Personnel providing emergency 
roadside assistance would then be immediately aware of the need to provide 
something more than just the usual standard service for the able-bodied. 
</P>
<P>
All members are limited to four (free-of-charge) assistance calls per year, 
notwithstanding the disabled require more and are hesitant to call for fear of 
the cost. Perhaps now, with a lawsuit pending on the rape issue, the club will 
feel compelled to address itself to the needs of the disabled as well.

NO-FAULT INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your April 19 headline and story on the passage of the no-fault automobile 
insurance legislation (AB 354) suggested that this was just a big win for the 
insurance industry ("Panel Approves Insurer-Backed No-Fault Bill," Part I, 
April 19). Actually, any benefits to insurance companies should translate into 
benefits for the consumer. Proposition 103 enacted strict oversight rules which 
will make any cost savings for the insurance companies into lower rates for 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, the companies and the author of the bill (Assemblyman Patrick 
Johnston, D-Stockton) pledged to add a strong prior approval regulatory system 
to the measure, if the court declares Proposition 103's protections invalid. 
(That, in and of itself, was news since the companies have never agreed to 
support any strengthening of California's insurance regulatory system.) 
</P>
<P>
Trial lawyers won't benefit from passage of the bill since the measure is 
designed to take small cases out of the clogged and costly court system. That's 
why the California Trial Lawyers' Assn. is devoting significant resources to 
defeating the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Payment of pain and suffering for minor injuries in the average fender-bender 
is eliminated under AB 354. That change will put some heavily advertised trial 
lawyer firms out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers will benefit. When Consumers Union and Johnston's staff drafted the 
bill, we matched it to New York's auto insurance system. There is guaranteed 
full and prompt payment for the medical costs and wage loss associated with 
most injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the New York system has kept the rates in that state relatively 
stable. Rates have only increased about 4% per year there, much less than the 
astronomical increases in California in the same time period. 
</P>
<P>
These are all subtle, but important, differences in the usual trial lawyer 
versus insurance company battle. The subtleties, though, are what made this 
bill pass where all insurance industry versions of no-fault auto insurance have 
failed. The news is that the Legislature is acting on a solution for California 
drivers.

NO-FAULT INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four letters (April 16) replying to Harvey Rosenfield's column "Rather Than 
Fighting 103, Insurers Should Seize the Chance It Gives Them" (Op-Ed Page, 
April 4) still do not hit the mark. Of course, costs for medical care, car 
repairs and lawsuits are going to go up, as Thomas Conneely of the Assn. of 
California Insurance Cos. indicates. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Taxier says Proposition 103 is an "opportunity for the insurance 
industry." Right. They have an opportunity to sponsor a media push for drivers 
of all ages to obey traffic laws and to be more courteous. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one program I know of in effect in California to help people be 
better, safer drivers. That is the Mature Driver Program for those age 55 and 
over given at senior centers and YMCAs throughout the greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
This law provides three years of auto insurance discount via a Department of 
Motor Vehicles certificate issued at the end of the 8-hour course. Most 
discounts are 5%, but it seems that seniors are waiting for the elusive larger 
Proposition 103 discount, not realizing the other benefits of taking this 
refresher course.

There will always be some accidents, but the careless drivers out there ("care 
less"?) are costing the rest of us and the insurance companies too much. Let's 
see what the insurance companies do with this opportunity.

Why hasn't it ever occurred to those opposing insurance companies to take 
operational control of a company and run it their way? 
</P>
<P>
With "fair" rates, the world would beat a path to the door. 
</P>
<P>
It would teach a lesson to the insurance companies that have supposedly been 
doing it all wrong for so long. Or, maybe it would teach a lesson to the new 
risk-takers whose money would then be where their mouth is now.

ANOTHER SHAM 'REFORM' FOR INSURANCE; 
</P>
<P>
WORKERS' COMPENSATION, ALREADY IN ILL HEALTH, IS ABOUT TO BE BLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE RABINE, Merle Rabine is president of the California Applicants' 
Attorneys Assn., which represents injured workers in workers' compensation 
cases. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reform used to mean making things better. 
</P>
<P>
However, judging by its use recently in discussing California's workers' 
compensation system, reform seems to have a new meaning: Engaging in flimflam 
for the sake of political expediency or good old-fashioned avarice. 
</P>
<P>
Under this mutated umbrella of reform, a cadre of employers and insurers, 
joined by a few labor officials, have concocted a proposal that is laughable in 
its pretensions and tragic in its implications. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would "reform" the workers' compensation system by reeling in 
employees with glittering but empty promises, while once again letting the real 
culprits -- insurance companies -- off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
There's no disagreement that the system is a mess. Employers pay nearly $8 
billion per year into the system, and yet California's maximum benefit of $224 
a week has been frozen since 1984 and ranks 45th among the 50 states. While the 
number of claims has been decreasing, the cost of insurance premiums has been 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
There can also be little disagreement as to why true reform has been stalled 
for so long. It is a hard, cold fact of the political system that when several 
interests are involved in an issue, consensus is hard to reach. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which has the backing of the governor, would require the approval 
of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
And there's no arguing that some people could benefit from this proposal, among 
them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Employers. Representatives of this group have jumped at the chance to trade 
some apparent extra costs for the greatly increased ability to block legitimate 
workers' compensation claims and to make it easier to get away with unsafe 
working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Insurers. This group must privately be laughing at how they snookered the 
others. Without giving up anything except a vague pledge to maybe try to trim 
their rates a bit, insurers won even more authority to squirm out of paying 
benefits to injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
Observant readers will note that one group is conspicuous by its absence from 
the preceding category of beneficiaries -- workers. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the 13 million Californians covered by the system get very, 
very little from this deal. 
</P>
<P>
In return for an increase in benefits for some workers, they are asked to give 
up an array of rights. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, a worker must earn $8.40 an hour to receive the maximum $224 
payment. Next year, under this plan, the same worker would have to make $12.25 
an hour to get the maximum payment of $322. By 1992, the worker would have to 
earn $19.16 per hour to get the maximum payment of $511. Of course, those still 
earning $8 an hour or less would get no increase. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lowest-paid workers would actually be eligible for less. 
Currently, part-time workers who are disabled on the job get a minimum payment 
of $112 per week. The minimum payment is designed to help keep the disabled 
person off government assistance programs such as welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new scheme, part-time workers would receive no more than their 
part-time salaries, even though they are foreclosed by their disabilities from 
accepting full-time work if they so desire. 
</P>
<P>
Workers with permanent disabilities would receive less, since the new scheme 
would deduct the part of the employer's cost of rehabilitation programs from 
their settlements. Workers whose permanent disabilities are serious enough to 
prevent them from returning to their job would also receive less. The new 
scheme would require them to pay for their own vocation-al rehabilitation with 
up to $10,000 of their permanent disability awards. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would create a huge, new bureaucracy that would serve little useful 
purpose other than to force workers to jump through even more hoops before they 
get their benefits. The increased costs of the bureaucracy would be financed by 
a new tax on employers. 
</P>
<P>
This plan is not only bad medicine, it's treating the wrong symptoms. It is 
based on the assumption that too much litigation and too many stress claims are 
to blame for the system's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. A recent study by the independent and nonpartisan auditor general's 
office found that 87% of all contested workers' comp cases are settled out of 
court. Attorney's fees are already capped, and average only 11% of the 
settlement amount. And stress claims, the study found, were not a significant 
cause of the system's increasing costs. 
</P>
<P>
This shouldn't surprise anyone, but the real tumor in the worker's compensation 
system is bloated insurance profits. 
</P>
<P>
The auditor general's report found that while insurers hiked rates 85% between 
1983 and 1987, they paid out only 60% more in benefits and costs. In 1983, 
their profit was $243 million. In 1987, it was $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, the new "reform" plan appears blissfully ignorant of these facts. 
It likewise ignores medical treatment costs, another factor the auditor general 
said should be examined. 
</P>
<P>
True reform of the workers' compensation system is desperately needed. It can 
come only when the true problems of the system are addressed.

IN THE MAY 4TH TRADITION, CHINESE STUDENTS SEEK A NEW TURNING POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE GOLDMAN, Merle Goldman is a professor of Chinese history at Boston 
University and is completing a book on China's democratic elite. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The student demonstrations that erupted last month after the death of Hu 
Yaobang, who had become a symbol of democracy, are very much in the Chinese 
tradition. The first student demonstration in modern times occurred 70 years 
ago today. Then, as in April, Beijing University students marched from their 
campus to Tian An Men Square to demonstrate against the government and demand 
"democracy and science." April's rally put less emphasis on science, which the 
government already supports, and more emphasis on demands for freedom of 
speech, rule of law, end of corruption and student-led, rather than party-led, 
organizations and publications. 
</P>
<P>
The May 4th Movement became a turning point in Chinese history, leading to the 
overthrow of the warlord government and rejection of Confucian ideology, which 
had dominated China for more than 2,000 years. Whereas the May 4th Movement 
challenged Confucianism, 1989's demonstration challenged Marxism-Leninism and 
the Communist Party that have dominated since 1949. Like the May 4th Movement, 
the April demonstration was well-organized, starting in Beijing and spreading 
to universities throughout China. That the students were able to conduct their 
protests of more than 100,000, facing off against policemen and military men 
without any major incident, shows the degree of organizational skill that they 
must have learned from their party elders, the very people they have turned 
against. 
</P>
<P>
Like their May 4th predecessors, the students, following the demonstration, 
have boycotted classes and mobilized support to their cause from other groups 
-- the middle class, workers and peasants. In modern times, student movements 
have only been successful when they have gained wider social support. There is 
evidence that members of the emerging small-scale entrepreneurial class that 
has been spawned by Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms has helped the students 
morally and financially. Workers on fixed incomes who have been hurt by 
inflation, also caused by the reforms, have joined in the demonstrations, 
though their concerns are more economic than political. 
</P>
<P>
The May 4th Movement was able to take place and expand because the warlord 
government was relatively weak. By contrast, China's present government can act 
decisively if it wishes. It is ironic that one reason the party leaders purged 
Hu as the general secretary in January, 1987, was because he had refused to 
repress the student demonstrations for democracy in December, 1986. Yet the 
same leaders have showed restraint this time. 
</P>
<P>
In part, the leadership is divided and uncertain about what action to take. 
Accelerating inflation, blatant corruption of officials and their children and 
the people's general discontent have created a potentially explosive situation, 
which the leaders fear may erupt into chaos if they crack down. Moreover, the 
memory of repression and anarchy of the Cultural Revolution, in which these 
leaders were among the victims, also is a limiting factor. Perhaps most 
important, unlike the regimes of the warlords, Chiang Kai-shek and Mao 
Tse-tung, the Deng regime has been reluctant to use violent means to suppress 
political demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Another restraint is China's concern with its image in the outside world. 
During the Cultural Revolution, China did not care about its image abroad. But 
today it does because it wants foreign capital, technology and help with its 
modernization. It also cares about its image in the communist world, in which 
it sees itself in competition with the Soviet Union in developing the most 
effective model for reform. Although China has stressed economic rather than 
political reform, it too has accepted the need for the latter. A bloody 
repression of students demanding democracy at the very time Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's visit is imminent could be very embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
Both the May 4, 1919, and April, 1989, demonstrations occurred in a pluralistic 
intellectual atmosphere in which many ideas from abroad were vigorously and 
publicly debated. Many of the students' teachers and intellectual elders had 
written about and openly advocated the democratic rights for which the students 
demonstrated. In the two months preceding the April demonstration, nearly 100 
of China's most prominent intellectuals had success makes you feel pessimistic. 
It condemns you to loneliness and makes you feel apart from the world. Talking 
so much about my films sometimes makes me depressed. I think dwelling on your 
organized a petition to the government demanding the release of political 
prisoners and democratic rights. This was the first time since 1949 that 
intellectuals had organized publicly for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
An important difference, however, between the two movements, is that they took 
place in different contexts. The May 4th occurred two years after the Russian 
Revolution, when it appeared that the Bolsheviks with their Marxist-Leninist 
ideology had found a way to modernize a backward country quickly. Its model and 
ideology became the inspiration for many of the participants of the May 4th 
Movement -- among them Mao -- who were to establish the Chinese Communist Party 
and eventually lead it to power. 
</P>
<P>
The participants in the April demonstration specifically reject that model and 
ideology as a failure and as inappropriate. The models today are the Western 
democratic systems and the idea of human rights as evolved in the West. 
However, just as the Chinese transformed Buddhism or Marxism-Leninism brought 
in from abroad, whatever they take from abroad today will be combined with 
aspects of their own tradition and society. 
</P>
<P>
This year is also the 40th anniversary of the Chinese Communist revolution. 
Will 1989 mark a comparable turning point in Chinese history?

PANAMA MANIA;

<P>
U.S. OBSESSION WITH NORIEGA HAS LATIN AMERICA IN A BIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The presidential election in Panama Sunday will, of course, mainly affect 
Panamanians. The violence, the tampering and the foreign involvement, whatever 
their respective intensity and likelihood, will hurt the inhabitants of Panama 
more than anybody else. But the election obviously will have implications far 
beyond Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, in pursuit of its predecessor's policy of removing 
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power, has made the Panamanians' vote a U.S. 
foreign-policy problem. Consequently, it is bound to become a problem for the 
rest of Latin America as well. 
</P>
<P>
The issue can be couched in relatively simple terms. Whatever actually happens 
in Panama this weekend, it is clear that the United States will take advantage 
of both the reality and the perception of electoral abuses to escalate its 
attempt to remove Noriega. But the more it emphasizes or amplifies the 
opposition's claims of tampering and repression, the greater the risk that, if 
Noriega successfully resists U.S. pressure once again, the Administration will 
be caught in a bind. It will feel compelled either to go beyond denunciations 
and threats and take some sort of punitive action, or concede that is powerless 
against the resilient Panamanian leader. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for other Latin American republics will then be similar to the one 
they have faced ever since the Reagan Administration had a change of heart 
about Noriega and embarked on the present course. But their dilemma will 
intensify if Noriega's candidate, Carlos Duque, is declared the winner Sunday 
under questionable circumstances. Most Latin American governments do not want 
to associate themselves with the U.S. campaign against Noriega; as always, they 
do not believe that Washington's displeasure is sufficient reason for forcing a 
change in governments. On the other hand, though, few countries in the region 
want to be placed in the situation of defending Noriega, much less of 
confronting the United States over Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Latin American stance has been successfully ambiguous. The Group 
of Eight that emerged in the Central America peace process (Argentina, Brazil, 
Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) suspended Panama's membership. 
Theoretically, it was to wait for a resolution of the question of who was the 
legitimate president of Panama, Eric del Valle (now in exile) or Manuel Solis 
Palma, chosen by Noriega to replace Del Valle. But if the United States uses 
Sunday's elections as a way to raise the ante against Noriega, which seems 
highly probable, the Latin American ambiguity will become more difficult to 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
This will be all the more true if the issue is placed in the context of 
democracy and repression. Should the countries of Latin America, with or 
without the United States, monitor elections in the region and impose sanctions 
-- formal or implicit -- on governments that engage in widespread electoral 
tampering? How many present Latin American governments would survive the test 
themselves? Probably not the region's two largest and most populous nations -- 
Brazil, which hasn't had direct elections for president since 1960, and Mexico, 
which has elected several but under dubious circumstances, to say the least. 
Conversely, would the United States and its closest allies in the hemisphere be 
as adamant in their questioning of unfair or unclean elections when those 
accused of tampering were more to their liking? 
</P>
<P>
For most Latin American governments, there will be no easy way to respond to 
the Panamanian imbroglio if the United States actually transforms it into a 
hemispheric crisis. The region's leadership should not, and probably will not, 
accept the fig leaf of electoral fraud as a cover for U.S. attempts to get rid 
of Noriega. The game, or more rightly the precedent, is not worth the candle. 
But neither should any government accept Noriega's tampering (if it occurs) on 
the grounds of nonintervention in another country's domestic political affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The best solution for Latin America's leaders is in all likelihood simply to do 
nothing. That is certain to cause displeasure in Washington, but for now it is 
the least costly position. And it will continue to be so, as long as there are 
no major changes -- mass violence, a U.S. invasion -- in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The broader question perhaps is whether it is worthwhile for the Bush 
Administration to begin its dealings with Latin America on this footing. The 
continuation of its predecessor's obsession with this so-called strong man 
strikes some as uncomfortably close to that other chimera of making the 
Sandinistas "cry uncle."

PARKING-GARAGE OPERATOR WITH 'IMAGE PROBLEM' LOSES FRANCHISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Handman, a local businessman who said last month that he was fighting an 
image war with City Hall bureaucrats, has lost his bid to continue managing two 
King Harbor parking structures for the city of Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A selection committee had recommended hiring another firm, and early Wednesday 
morning the City Council ratified that decision. The council's unanimous vote 
came near the end of a 10-hour session that lasted until 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Handman, who was seen in the council chambers around 1 
a.m., had left by the time the parking decision came up for discussion. He did 
not present his case for keeping the parking franchise, which his firm has held 
for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
Handman, owner of Hill Parking Systems, could not be reached Wednesday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Firm Favored 
</P>
<P>
In its report for the April 18 council meeting, the parking selection committee 
favored Executive Parking Inc. of West Los Angeles. Executive Parking was 
favored despite asking to be paid $47,400 annually to manage the parking 
facilities for three years, $27,000 more than Handman sought for the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
The committee noted that Executive Parking representatives wore business suits 
and "performed admirably" at their interview, while Handman showed up in casual 
beach style and complained about the city's reluctance to replace aging 
equipment at the parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
On April 18, Handman got the council to delay its decision for two weeks, 
saying he had just received the parking panel's unfavorable report. Handman 
contended that the selection process was unfair because it gave more weight to 
style than to substance. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Director Sheila Schoettger said a search was made outside the council 
chambers early Wednesday morning, but Handman, who had been waiting his turn 
since the meeting began at 6:30 the night before, was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
Neither was hardly anyone else at that hour, near the end of one of the longer 
Redondo Beach council meetings in years. It wound up at 4:30 a.m., a city 
official reported. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the session was devoted to a debate about renewing Coast Christian 
School's lease and to a lengthy list of public hearings on building projects. 
Handman's appeal was one of the last items on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, after learning that the parking panel had recommended Executive 
Parking, Handman said that city officials were holding his casual-but-upscale 
style against him. He said he also may have "rubbed some people the wrong way" 
because of his "abrasive" manner in past disputes with officials, particularly 
over the aging equipment that measures how long people park and computes the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettger, the harbor director, said Wednesday that she had no comment on any 
image problems Handman may have. But, she observed, applicants for jobs 
"impress people in a number of ways, and some of them can be ephemeral and hard 
to quantify." 
</P>
<P>
On the more tangible side, she said, the committee's reasons for faulting 
Handman included his failure to use "state-of-the-art" computer systems to 
track receipts at the Redondo Pier and Plaza parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Acquire Extras 
</P>
<P>
She said the city supplies the machines that spit out tickets, but it's left up 
to the operators to acquire extras like computers. Companies such as Executive 
Parking do that, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the council meeting Tuesday night, Handman was waiting near 
the door of the chambers. His blue coat and tan slacks looked new, and for a 
change he had added a tie. He said he was trying to counter "that image they've 
stuck on me." 
</P>
<P>
After several hours of waiting, Handman's spiffy appearance began to fade. 
There were wrinkles in his coat, and he had loosened his tie until it hardly 
hung on his neck. 
</P>
<P>
By 1 o'clock in the morning, he appeared bedraggled and bleary-eyed -- like 
most everyone else still haunting the council lobby at that hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know when my turn is coming," he said glumly. 
</P>
<P>
He had to be in a distant city later that morning, he said.

FIRMS BILLED FOR WATER CLEANUP; 
</P>
<P>
EPA TELLS 27 COMPANIES TO PROVIDE $71.2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, acting under the federal Superfund 
toxic cleanup program, has told 27 Burbank-area companies to pay for a 
$70-million ground water treatment system to purge Burbank water supply wells 
of chemical solvents. 
</P>
<P>
The agency wrote letters to the firms that it said should be considered a 
"formal demand for reimbursement of costs that have been incurred and that are 
expected to be incurred" in the ground water cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The five-page letters, mailed Tuesday, gave the companies 120 days to negotiate 
with the EPA to determine their share of the cleanup bill. The companies were 
invited to a May 18 meeting at Burbank City Hall to discuss the Superfund 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA did not cite any evidence linking the companies to ground water 
contamination, which is sure to be an issue in the negotiations. While many of 
the companies are thought to have used and perhaps leaked the offending 
chemicals at some time in the past, only one is a confirmed polluter of ground 
water, according to state water quality records that are the EPA's main source 
of data. 
</P>
<P>
That company is Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. of Burbank, whose huge 
production complex is just uphill from Burbank municipal water supply wells 
that are contaminated by trichloroethylene, known as TCE, and 
perchloroethylene, called PCE, suspected cancer-causing solvents. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Ross Hopkins said Wednesday that the company had not 
received the letter but has been expecting it. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins said Lockheed "will be participating" in the cleanup work but doesn't 
know yet what share the firm is willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Denying Responsibility' 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is a delicate one, because a lot of these people are denying 
responsibility and pointing the finger at us," Hopkins said, referring to the 
other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed has already spent $4 million on a system to treat water pumped from 
beneath its own plant, but the system treats only a fraction of the area's 
tainted ground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has tentatively approved a $70-million treatment system in the vicinity 
of Burbank's municipal water supply wells. The system would include a series of 
extraction wells and aeration towers to remove the chemicals as vapor. It would 
handle 12,000 gallons of water a minute, producing enough drinking water to 
supply 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
According to the letters, the EPA also wants the companies to pay $1.2 million 
it said it has spent on studies and investigation, in addition to the cost of 
the cleanup system. 
</P>
<P>
A vast area of the San Fernando Valley ground water basin, from North Hollywood 
east into the Verdugo Mountains, is contaminated by TCE and PCE after decades 
of widespread use of the chemicals in metal degreasing and dry-cleaning 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The pollution has shut down some wells operated by the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power and other utilities. The worst contamination is in Burbank, 
which has temporarily abandoned its ground water supply and increased its 
reliance on more expensive water from the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Bisson, Superfund state programs chief for the EPA in San Francisco, said 
the agency would like the companies "as a whole to come forward and do the 
cleanup." If they don't, she said, the EPA could do the work and go to court to 
recover the cost, or issue a formal order requiring the work and ask a judge to 
enforce it.

PALOS VERDES ESTATES PARKING BUST LEAVES OPINION DIVIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone has an opinion on the great Palos Verdes Estates parking bust. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Gary Johansen said some people have called him a defender of the 
law, while others say he has turned the affluent city into a police state. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the strong feelings: the arrest, handcuffing, fingerprinting and 
frisking April 21 of two business-women who, police say, wiped chalk marks off 
the tires of their cars to avoid parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department filed misdemeanor charges this week against Rosina Baur, 
manager of the Coldwell Banker real estate office in the Malaga Cove Plaza 
shopping center, and Anne Bisco, a receptionist with the same office. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, each faces up to a $1,000 fine and six months in jail. They are 
to appear in South Bay Municipal Court on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
The case has aroused strong feelings on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, where Baur 
has lived for 30 years and Bisco arrived several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have called or written to praise the 23-member Police Department 
for freeing more parking space at the crowded shopping center, while others 
called the arrests a gross overreaction to a minor problem. The 50 writers and 
callers are evenly divided on the issue, Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is in the middle," Johansen said. "Either we are the Gestapo, or they 
say, 'Right on, you did exactly the right thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
The incident has its roots in an ongoing parking problem in Malaga Cove Plaza. 
A meter maid who came to enforce the one-hour parking limit at the picturesque, 
Spanish-style shopping center reported that she left chalk marks on Baur's 
Mazda and Bisco's Toyota, only to return later and find the marks wiped off. 
</P>
<P>
The meter maid reportedly notified Officer Robert Connor, who walked into the 
Coldwell Banker office and told Baur and Bisco that they were under arrest. The 
women followed Connor to his squad car, where they were handcuffed and driven 
to Police Department headquarters for booking, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bisco acknowledged that she wiped a chalk mark off her car's tire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moving Car Legal 
</P>
<P>
But Baur denied that she did, saying that she merely moved her car to another 
space when she saw the meter maid coming. Such a move is legal since the 
one-hour time limit applies to individual spaces, not to the entire lot, a 
police official said. 
</P>
<P>
The women said their arrests were unnecessary and that Officer Connor told them 
he was going to arrest them to "teach them a lesson" against parking illegally 
in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
They asked the Police Department not to press the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Bisco said she expects to be through with the case after going to court and 
paying a fine. But Baur has hired an attorney, Ray Legg, to fight the charge. 
Legg said several witnesses will verify that Baur moved her car and did not rub 
off a chalk mark. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer was clearly wrong and still went ahead and arrested her," Legg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adverse Publicity 
</P>
<P>
Johansen said that Connor and other officers have been instructed not to 
comment on the incident but that the department is "feeling put upon" by the 
adverse publicity from the case. 
</P>
<P>
Johansen insisted that the department acted properly in arresting the two 
women; tickets are not issued for misdemeanors. "This is the only law we have 
on the books to deal with this problem," he said. "We didn't have any other 
choices." 
</P>
<P>
The chief defended Connor's arrest of Baur and Bisco, saying the women would 
have objected more and suffered greater embarrassment if police reports and 
citations had been completed in the public shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The handcuffing, fingerprinting and frisking are all standard procedures that 
are not waived for any arrestees, Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Johansen said it is ironic that merchants should complain about parking 
enforcement, since patrols at Malaga Cove Plaza were increased in March at the 
request of the Malaga Cove Businessman's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had complaints from business people that their customers have no place 
to park," Johansen said. "It's kind of like they want it both ways."

MAKEUP ARTIST SENTENCED IN 2 BOMB DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood makeup artist was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison 
without the possibility of parole in the 1986 deaths of two Los Angeles Police 
Department explosives experts. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Morse, 39, was sentenced by San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. 
Major. Morse was convicted April 3 of two counts of first-degree murder and one 
count of possessing explosives in the deaths of the officers, who were killed 
while trying to dismantle a pipe bomb at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Morse also was convicted of special-circumstance allegations that would have 
qualified him for the death penalty. But the district attorney's office decided 
not to seek such a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the explosion Feb. 8, 1986, were Detective Arleigh McCree, 46, 
commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and Officer Ronald 
Ball, 43. The officers were the first Los Angeles bomb squad members to be 
killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
Before his sentencing Wednesday, Morse was allowed to make a brief statement to 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statement to Court 
</P>
<P>
"I have been accused and convicted of something I have not done," Morse said, 
holding up a Bible. "I can't think of any reason I would hurt anyone. In my 
heart and conscience, I am clear that I am not a murderer." 
</P>
<P>
Morse, dressed in a dark gray suit, said he brought the Bible to court because 
"this is the book I try to live by, to respect others by." Morse appeared calm 
moments later when Major pronounced the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Edie McCree, the detective's widow, said she is comfortable with the 
penalty imposed on Morse. She said she was not surprised by Morse's statement 
in court. "What else can he say? The evidence showed that he did it." 
</P>
<P>
Morse's attorney, Bernard J. Rosen, said his client will appeal. Rosen said 
Major erred when he refused to allow the introduction of evidence suggesting 
that the officers were negligent and caused their own deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Major ruled that because the bomb was an illegal and deadly device, its 
possession was at least a contributing factor in the officers' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Morse, the defendant's 38-year-old brother, who lived with him at the 
time of the blast, said his brother could not get a fair trial because the 
"judge led the jury in the direction he wanted them to go." 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Morse said he and his brother had no knowledge of the bombs found in the 
garage of the North Hollywood home they shared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Searching for Pistol 
</P>
<P>
Police said they went to Morse's home to search for a pistol used four days 
earlier to shoot an official of the Makeup Artists and Hair Stylists Union 
Local 706, of which Morse was a member. The gun was not found, and Morse was 
not charged in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
While searching the defendant's garage, officers found two pipe bombs and 
summoned McCree and Ball. The two dismantled one bomb, but were killed while 
trying to defuse the second. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, police testified that Morse denied any knowledge of the bombs 
when they were discovered. Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris argued that as 
a result, Morse contributed to the officer's deaths by withholding information 
that could have helped the officers defuse the devices. 
</P>
<P>
Police experts testified that Morse's fingerprints were found on several items 
surrounding the bombs and that explosive powder, batteries, tape and electrical 
wires used in the manufacture of bombs were in the garage and in the house. 
They also testified that the defendant's fingerprints were found on a copy of a 
bomb-making manual found in his library.

MOBIL'S PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM SURVEYS TORRANCE TO AID REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A public relations firm hired by Mobil Oil Corp. is surveying residents by 
telephone and interviewing community leaders as part of an effort by Mobil's 
Torrance refinery to quell public concerns about safety at the accident-plagued 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three months, Braun &amp; Co., a public relations firm from Los 
Angeles, has asked residents, business leaders, City Council members and school 
officials about their perception of the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Braun will compile the information and suggest ways Mobil can ease anxiety 
about safety and improve relations with Torrance residents, Mobil officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were hired to help us communicate with the community," said Mobil 
spokesman James Cabonetti. 
</P>
<P>
However, residents and city officials say Mobil's efforts may be too little, 
too late. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert, who met with Braun representatives last month, said: "I 
told them they have been brought in after the house had already burned down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gargantuan feat 
</P>
<P>
Janie Butcher, PTA president at Magruder Middle School, said improving Mobil's 
image is going to be a Gargantuan feat. Butcher's 12-year-old daughter was 
among 10 people hospitalized in March after foul-smelling fumes entered the 
school. The fumes were not traced to the nearby refinery, but Mobil officials 
offered to pay the hospital bills. 
</P>
<P>
"If people stop dying," Butcher said, "if people stop blowing up; if the city 
stops smelling like rotten eggs, and if kids stop throwing up in the 
playgrounds, then I'd be impressed." 
</P>
<P>
The troubled refinery has been plagued by explosions, fires and releases of 
gas. Three people have been killed and more than a dozen injured at the 
refinery. The series of accidents, which began with an explosion and two-day 
fire in November, 1987, has prompted a city lawsuit and an initiative campaign 
to limit the refinery's use of hydrofluoric acid, which is acutely toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Wyman D. Robb, refinery manager, said these actions prompted Mobil to try to 
improve public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're a bunch of engineers, and we're not geared for that kind of 
public relations communication," he said. "Perhaps things would have been 
better if we'd done that sooner." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is a lack of understanding," Robb said. "We need an educational 
effort to let people know what we do and how we do it." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil is also considering placing ads in local newspapers, holding public 
meetings and offering tours of the refinery to improve ties with Torrance 
residents, Robb said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not Mobil's first attempt to communicate directly with Torrance 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The firm mailed letters of apology to 14,000 households last August "for any 
inconveniences or anxiety" created by accidents at the plant. The letter said 
that the series of accidents may have given residents "cause for concern about 
the safety of our operation." But, it said, "safety remains the No. 1. 
priority" at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Braun &amp; Co., which specializes in investor relations, public affairs and 
marketing, was hired in February. Among some of Braun's better-known clients 
are Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Braun has worked with other petroleum companies, such as Pauley Petroleum in 
Los Angeles, and Western States Petroleum Assn. in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Prime Issue 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with residents and community leaders have shown that people are most 
interested in learning what Mobil is doing to ensure safety at the refinery, 
Braun representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
"What Mobil has been hearing, and what we are hearing also, is that one problem 
is a real lack of communication with the community," said Betsy Eaton, a senior 
counselor with Braun. "We keep hearing from City Council members all the way 
down to people in their homes that they want more information about the 
refinery." 
</P>
<P>
City officials agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to get out from behind the walls and get out in the community," 
said Councilwoman Dee Hardison, who met with Braun representatives three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying nothing is perceived as not caring," she said. "I said, 'Go out and 
make the community more knowledgeable about what you do and how you do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hardison said she doesn't believe that Mobil's public relations push will hurt 
the lawsuit the city filed in Los Angeles Superior Court last month. The suit 
alleges that the refinery is a public nuisance and asks for authority to 
regulate it. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert agreed with Hardison, saying the suit will most likely not be affected 
by public opinion. Braun representatives did not try to discuss the lawsuit 
when they met with her, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she told Braun representatives that Mobil should have invited 
concerned residents to a public meeting months ago to discuss how the refinery 
is addressing safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Applegate said that, before the accidents, Mobil had a good 
reputation among residents and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They supported city projects and the city," he said. "I felt that they played 
a part in the community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unaware of Extent 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they didn't realize how bad they screwed up and how bad their image 
was being battered on a regular basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Walker, who has launched a direct-mail initiative campaign aimed 
at forcing Mobil to abandon the use of hydrofluoric acid, said the refinery's 
efforts to improve its image would not affect his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mobil Oil can prove that (hydrofluoric) acid is safe, then they will be 
pulling a rabbit out of a hat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Mackey, special services administrator for the Torrance Unified School 
District, said concern among school officials has been heightened since the 
incident in March at Magruder Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had concern about the things that are emitted from the refinery," he 
said. "From time to time, we have complained about odors." 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year resident of Torrance, who asked that her name not be published, said 
she received a telephone call from Braun more than a month ago. She said that 
during the five-minute interview she was asked her opinion about life in 
Torrance, the refinery, chemicals used at the plant and her city 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very general questions," she said. "Nothing specific." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she is worried and that Mobil will be hard-pressed to ease her 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, if they cleared up their safety record, people might feel better," 
she said.

STOLEN TRUCK CARRIED RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Valencia company said a device containing radioactive materials was in a 
pickup truck stolen Tuesday in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The substance was locked in a thick steel cage and does not pose an immediate 
danger, said Ross Khiabani, chief engineer for the Valencia office of Leighton 
&amp; Associates, an Irvine-based company specializing in geotechnical 
consulting. He said the cage could be opened only with a special key owned by 
the manufacturer of the device, which is a gauge for testing moisture density 
in soil. 
</P>
<P>
The company is offering a $500 reward for information leading to recovery of 
the gauge. 
</P>
<P>
The gauge and other testing equipment were in the bed of a red 1988 Mazda 
pickup stolen Tuesday afternoon from a parking lot at San Fernando Mission and 
Balboa boulevards, said company spokeswoman Jamie Milteer. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-pound gauge is yellow and resembles an upright vacuum cleaner, Milteer 
said. It was secured to the truck with a chain and lock.

"Scofflaw: flouting the law" -- Webster's. 
</P>
<P>
These scofflaws not only flouted the law, but they did so with very selfish 
motives: They also, in flouting the law, very selfishly deprived other 
motorists of the right to park in the obviously crowded Malaga Cove shopping 
plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Their acts, while not criminal, were offenses against society as a whole -- and 
they justly deserve whatever punishment the courts mete out. 
</P>

Inconsiderate, selfish people comprise the greater number of scofflaws, whose 
only interests are self-interests . . . and the public be damned.

PORTER RANCH PROJECT: DEVELOPER'S FOLLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Los Angeles city fathers are silly enough to approve the proposed huge 
Chatsworth-Porter Ranch project, I predict that the quality of life will 
dramatically decline for every person living north of Roscoe Boulevard and west 
of Interstate 405. That's how big an area it will negatively affect. 
</P>
<P>
Who can be naive enough to believe the folly being foisted on us by the 
developer, such as predictions that adding another 155,000 car trips per day 
will result in less traffic congestion than we now have without them. Their 
"traffic mitigation plan," which will supposedly produce this miracle, includes 
some new stripes on certain streets and some computerized traffic lights. Too 
bad they forgot to include one minor item -- enough roadway surface to hold all 
the cars. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that L.A. planners never learn from their past mistakes. One 
look at the Ventura Freeway, clogged from end to end by the 20-year buildup of 
Warner Ranch and Ventura Boulevard, shows what the north Valley will look like 
in the years ahead, traffic congestion, high-rises and all. 
</P>
<P>
At recent public hearings, allies of the developer repeatedly said how nice it 
will be to have nearby Schubert-type theaters, shopping and parks in Porter 
Ranch. If that's what they want, I have a suggestion for them: Move back East 
to Manhattan. They'll find theaters no one can afford to attend and huge parks 
unsafe for anyone without previous commando training. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, I left the original (pricey) Schubert Theater and Central Park of 
Manhattan 20 years ago so I could live in a suburban community where my life 
style included low-density housing, equestrian and other outdoor recreational 
facilities, non-crowded streets and unspoiled foothills. That's the Chatsworth 
I was promised when I moved here, and that's the one every resident I've talked 
to still wants. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not against sensible growth, and I am not a member of the Sierra Club or 
any other similar organization, but I wonder if we'll ever find a vaccine for 
the strange disease that seems to afflict every California land developer -- 
you know, the one that causes them to hyperventilate and have recurring 
nightmares every time they run across an unused piece of land, an unclogged 
road or a place where things are just fine the way they are now. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not fooled by the tactics being used to ramrod this project through the 
approval cycle: It was kept a secret until just a few months ago, years after 
the developer bought some cheap land zoned for low-density housing and 
concocted a get-rich scheme whereby if he got the zoning changed to include 
millions of square feet of commercial use, he'd make millions, or perhaps close 
to billions. No, he's using a sham of asking for the stars and settling for the 
moon. They'll cut it down a million or so square feet, but the congestion will 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Bernson faces a problem though. His so-called Citizens Advisory Committee 
orchestrated this fiasco and almost all the area's residents are against it. As 
soon as he realizes how many, look for him to make a back-room deal whereby he 
votes against it to save face, while (according to the predicted script), all 
his fellow councilmen vote it in. Hal, baby, it won't work! 
</P>
<P>
Haven't we got enough traffic and other problems in L.A. already? Why create 
more until we fix them? The night before the mayoral election, defeated 
candidate Baxter Ward said we should hang big signs reading "Closed for Repair" 
on all roads entering Los Angeles. What a delightfully refreshing approach.

EX-PASTOR GIVEN WORK FURLOUGH FOR MOLESTING AN UNDERAGE GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former pastor of a Chula Vista Pentecostal church was sentenced Wednesday 
to six months in a work-furlough program for molesting an underage girl. 
</P>
<P>
With many church members and friends of the South Bay Pentecostal Church 
attending the sentencing, Lyn Meche, 39, was also ordered to register as a sex 
offender. 
</P>
<P>
Meche was placed on three years' probation and ordered to pay for therapy for 
the girl, now 18. The amount will be determined later. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick fined Meche $150 and ordered him to 
report to the program May 30. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryn Rosen said Meche will be free to work days but will be 
locked up at night and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Meche pleaded no contest March 17 to two misdemeanor counts of molesting the 
girl over a period of years. He could have been sentenced to one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Under his probation, the former preacher was ordered not to associate with 
minors unless he is in the presence of a responsible adult aware of his 
conviction. Meche was also ordered not to frequent places where minors 
congregate. 
</P>
<P>
Misdemeanor charges are still pending against two other ministers from the same 
church, Arthur Hodges III, 32, and George Nobbs, 32. They are accused of 
failing to report the molestation to authorities after the girl told them about 
it.

CLOSING OF BALBOA PARK SPAN IN TRAFFIC TEST CALLED SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A one-day test run of a new traffic plan in Balboa Park that closed Cabrillo 
Bridge to westbound traffic was successful, according to city officials who 
said Wednesday that they will try the exercise again in June. 
</P>
<P>
Cars could not leave the park by using the bridge to Laurel Street on Tuesday, 
and the parking lot in front of the San Diego Museum of Art was turned into an 
outdoor cafe, complete with a jazz band. Three trams ran from other parking 
lots in the park to the central museum area during the trial demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
City spokesman Dave Twomey said that, although computerized survey results were 
not yet complete, initial public reaction was positive. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it went very well. . . . I did not see any negative reactions at 
all to the removal of the parking," he said. "We had very positive results on 
the tram and some mixed reviews on how inconvenient it was (that) you couldn't 
leave the park through Cabrillo Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Twomey said there was no backup of traffic and people were willing to park 
farther away because trams were available. 
</P>
<P>
He said the exercise will be tried again in June, on a weekend. He said it is 
planned to put something like it in effect as a permanent solution.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMITTEE REJECTS LAND SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Assembly Transportation Committee on Monday narrowly rejected a proposal to 
allow the city of Hawthorne to purchase for $2,000 surplus state-owned land 
that the state Department of Transportation figures is worth about $4.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) failed on an 8-5 vote, one short of the 
nine required, to gain approval for his legislation. The committee, however, 
agreed to reconsider the legislation at a later hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne has sought for the past six years to purchase the vacant property, 
two narrow parcels along Glasgow Place, next to the San Diego Freeway near 
Rosecrans Avenue, and turn it into parks and parking areas. City officials said 
the land, near the Holly Glen neighborhood, is zoned for open space and is not 
suitable for development, partly because of its proximity to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transportation opposed the bill, maintaining that state law 
requires Caltrans to sell land at fair market value. Caltrans officials said 
the land could be sold for about $4.4 million and developed for residential and 
commercial purposes.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSING ORDINANCE DEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Avalon City Council voted 3 to 2 against adopting an ordinance that would 
have required developers of new commercial projects to provide housing for half 
of their employees. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Hal Host, Paul Puma and Irene Strobel voted against final 
adoption of the ordinance. The vote reversed a 4-1 decision by the council to 
adopt the ordinance at its introduction two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, while a new ordinance is being drafted, the council voted unanimously 
Tuesday to direct the Planning Commission to advise developers that they will 
be required to build low- and moderate-income employee housing after the new 
housing ordinance is approved, City Clerk Shirley Davy said. 
</P>
<P>
The defeated ordinance would have required new commercial developments with 10 
or more employees to provide housing for 50% of those employees during the peak 
tourist season in August. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing Tuesday, however, residents and council members 
expressed concern about the wording of the ordinance and argued that the 
ordinance did not set housing requirements for existing businesses that may 
expand in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which will draw up the new ordinance, set a 60-day deadline to 
come up with a new draft and requested that public comment be submitted in 
writing, Davy said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROBE OF AUTO THEFTS LEADS TO ARREST OF 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amonth-long investigation into a Simi Valley car theft ring has resulted in the 
arrests of three men who sold parts of stolen Porsches that were stripped in a 
residential garage, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested Tuesday were Earl James, 28, of Simi Valley; Mark James, 27, of Canoga 
Park, and Arturo Betanzos, 19, of Glendale, Simi Valley Police Sgt. Ron Lompart 
said. They were in custody on suspicion of grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
Lompart said he did not know if Earl and Mark James are related. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, which began in early April, involved officers from the Simi 
Valley and Los Angeles police departments and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, Lompart said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the men after staking out Earl James' residence in the 2100 
block of Bromfield Street, Lompart said. 
</P>
<P>
James was arrested after he drove away in a pickup truck that contained stolen 
auto parts, police said. The other two were arrested later inside James' house. 
</P>
<P>
Officers serving a search warrant later discovered two partially stripped 
Porsches in James' garage, Lompart said. A third Porsche was found inside a 
rented truck parked in front of the house, he said. The cars, all stolen in Los 
Angeles County, are worth about $100,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lompart said Earl James bought the Porsches at "top dollar" from auto thieves 
and drove them to his garage, where he stripped them.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY TO FATALLY STABBING MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima teen-ager who stabbed a man to death before stealing his truck 
pleaded guilty Wednesday in San Fernando Superior Court to second-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Keasuc Napolean Hill, 18, had been charged with first-degree murder and one 
count of robbery in the April 16, 1988, slaying of James Zoldseth of Sun 
Valley. But those charges will be dismissed in exchange for his plea to the 
lesser charge, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who was 17 at the time of the killing, remains in custody without bail at 
Sylmar Juvenile Hall and was ordered to return to court on May 26 for 
sentencing. As part of the plea agreement, Nison said, Hill will be sentenced 
to 15 years to life for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was a juvenile at the time of the incident, Hill is eligible to 
serve time in the California Youth Authority until he is 25, when he can be 
transferred to state prison, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Zoldseth had given Hill and another youth a ride after Hill 
promised to take the victim to an apartment where he could buy drugs. 
Authorities said Hill then stabbed Zoldseth 11 times in the chest and back 
before taking off in the truck with the other youth, who is still being sought.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESS AIDS STABBING VICTIM, THEN HELPS CAPTURE 
SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A witness to a crime in Palmdale on Tuesday night did more than just watch. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Adame, 34, helped the victim of a stabbing on the street, chased the 
attacker a mile to a bar and subdued him with the help of patrons until police 
arrived, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Harris, 30, of Lancaster was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder 
and was being held without bail at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station. The 
victim, 21-year-old Keith Harper of Palmdale, underwent surgery for five wounds 
to the chest and abdomen at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. He was in stable 
condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ron Bozeman said Harris is suspected of stabbing Harper about 10:30 p.m. 
Tuesday at 5th Street East and Palmdale Boulevard after an argument over a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
Adame, a Rosamond resident who was in a nearby parking lot, saw the stabbing 
and helped Harper into a car that Harper's cousin drove to the hospital, Sgt. 
Ron Shreves said. Adame then pursued the attacker to the bar, where he told 
patrons of the stabbing, he said. They helped him subdue Harris and called 
police, Shreves said.

TRIAL ORDERED IN ANCHORWOMAN EXTORTION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The key figure in the alleged extortion plot against television anchorwoman 
Jann Carl was ordered on Wednesday to stand trial in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Karl Jaeger, after a six-day preliminary hearing of the 
case against producer Gil Cabot, ruled that there is sufficient evidence that 
Cabot attempted to extort $30,000 from the KTLA-TV newswoman. Cabot is accused 
of telling Carl that he could make sure sexually explicit pictures of her would 
not be published in return for a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he had "no problem in denying" motions by Cabot's attorney, 
Rowan Klein, to drop the conspiracy and attempted extortion charges. 
</P>
<P>
Carl and KTLA deny that any pictures exist. Police contend that Cabot cooked up 
the hoax on the expectation that Carl would pay off out of fear that her career 
could be hurt, even by groundless accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot and his attorney, Maurice Attie, were arrested June 20, 1988, after a 
meeting with Carl and an FBI agent who was posing as her fiance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
Charges against Attie were dismissed by Jaeger after Attie's attorney, Robert 
Shapiro, argued that his client was drawn into the scheme unaware of what was 
happening. Shapiro said Attie simply accepted Cabot's story that he was trying 
to help the anchorwoman out of a predicament when he went to the meeting at 
which the payoff was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"He is naive to the extreme," Shapiro said. "A believer, perhaps a true 
believer." 
</P>
<P>
The case against Cabot, 43, is based on a series of tape-recorded phone calls 
that began in April of last year. Prosecutors contend that Cabot assumed three 
different identities during the conversations, which began with a call to KTLA 
news director Jeff Wald warning him that a videotape of Carl was making the 
rounds of bachelor parties in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The caller said Carl did not appear to be aware she was being filmed. 
</P>
<P>
Carl said that when she learned of the call she immediately thought of Cabot. 
"He was the only person that I knew that I had recently angered," she testified 
during the hearing. Cabot had sent her flowers and tried to persuade her to 
work with him on his proposal for a television interview show to be called "Up 
Close and Personal." They could not agree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Played Along 
</P>
<P>
Carl said she decided to play along with the calls and pretend to be concerned 
about the threat that pictures lifted from the videotape might be published in 
a sex magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Gil, I really need your help," she says at one point on the tape. Later, she 
sniffs and sounds as though she might be crying in desperation. She wonders "if 
I could find out who did this to me." 
</P>
<P>
Asked during her testimony if she worried that by pretending to participate in 
the plot, she might help make it public, thereby harming her career, she 
replied: "We discussed that there would be some people who would believe what 
they wanted to believe. Pursuing what was right was more important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Police say Cabot is a sophisticated con man who has taken advantage of aspiring 
performers as well as established stars. He was convicted on grand theft 
charges and sent to prison in 1982, police said. If convicted on the most 
serious charge in the present case, he could receive a 5-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot insists that he was only trying to help a woman in distress and argues 
that no crime occurred because there was no exchange of money. Carl never made 
the promised payoff.

WILANDER TAKES YET ANOTHER EMBARRASSING FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Second-ranked Mats Wilander continued his downward slide Wednesday with a 6-1, 
6-3 loss to Francesco Cancellotti of Italy in the second round of the 
Tournament of Champions at Forest Hills, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Cancellotti, ranked 86th in the world, eliminated the Swede in 57 minutes at 
the West Side Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wilander I beat today is not the No. 2 player in the world," said 
Cancellotti, who won his first-round match earlier in the day. "He's a 
completely different player than last year. It looks like it doesn't make a 
difference whether he wins or loses." 
</P>
<P>
"I played a good match today, but he's not fighting anymore. Maybe he can't 
find the right motivation. You should ask him what's going on in his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters didn't have a chance because Wilander didn't show up for the 
postmatch interview. He apparently is tired of explaining the slump he has 
endured since taking the No. 1 ranking from Ivan Lendl in the U.S. Open last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander held the top spot for just four months, falling to second with an 
early loss at the Australian Open in January. Since then, he has lost six of 11 
matches, including two defeats by Austrians in the Davis Cup quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"To see Wilander on the court like this is not a good thing for tennis," 
Cancellotti said. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl breezed into the third round with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Martin 
Wostenholme of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Yannick Noah of France had to retire because of a foot injury. 
Noah reinjured his right foot during a second-round match against Jaime Yzaga 
of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Noah lost the first set, 6-2, and was serving at 2-2 in the second when he 
rushed the net, pulled up hobbling and fell to the ground in pain. He was 
helped to his feet but walked off under his own power. 
</P>
<P>
In other second-round matches, defending champion Andre Agassi, who has not 
reached a Grand Prix final this year, took control in the third set to beat 
Fernando Luna of Spain, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0; fourth-seeded Tim Mayotte downed Bruno 
Oresar of Yugoslavia, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4; No. 7 Brad Gilbert defeated Alex 
Antonitsch of Austria, 7-5, 6-4, and No. 8 Michael Chang saved four match 
points before turning back Josef Cihak of Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good win for me," Chang said. "When you're down like that, you want 
to find the nearest bed and go to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
In a first-round match, No. 13 Jay Berger was upset by Richey Reneberg, 6-7 
(7-6), 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Vieira, an 18-year-old Brazilian, upset second-seeded Helena Sukova of 
Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 1-6, 6-4, in a $200,000 Virginia Slims tournament at 
Hamburg, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The match was interrupted by darkness Tuesday, and Vieira completed the victory 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard of her before," said Sukova, ranked fifth in the world and the 
runner-up in the Australian Open. "She used my mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Said Vieira, ranked 128th in the world: "This was a totally unexpected victory 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Hanika of West Germany reached the third round by beating Patricia 
Tarabini of Argentina, 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to apply full pressure," said Hanika, who had to withdraw from a 
tournament in Barcelona last week because of a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, Arantxa Sanchez of Spain ousted Wiltrud Probst of West 
Germany, 6-2, 6-2, while Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria beat Christine Damas of 
France, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Jagerman of the Netherlands earned the dubious honor of becoming 
top-seeded Steffi Graf's first opponent by sweeping past Gisele Miro of Brazil, 
6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Graf advanced to the third round by default when Sabine Hack of West Germany 
became ill and withdrew from the clay-court tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Audra Keller of Memphis, seeded No. 1 in the 18-and-under division, opened the 
Seventeen Magazine tournament with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Vickie Paynter of 
Denville, N.J., at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Cammie Foley of Bonita also advanced, but she was extended before 
finally downing Michelle McMillen of East Palestine, Ohio, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In the 16-and-under competition, No. 1-seeded Keri Phebus of Newport Beach 
scored a 6-2, 6-0 win over Susie Starett of North Aurora, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
In the 14-and-under class, Nicole London of Rolling Hills Estates beat Robyn 
Gurney of Candler, N.C., 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, which includes 96 players from 30 states and Puerto Rico, 
continues through Saturday.

JORDAN'S PREMEDITATED 3-POINT PLAY LIFTS BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Jordan scored 44 points, including four free throws in the final 
seconds, as the Chicago Bulls defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 101-94, 
Wednesday night at Chicago to take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-5 Eastern 
Conference playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls could advance to the next round, against New York, with a victory at 
Chicago Stadium Friday night. If the Cavaliers win, the final game wil be 
played at Richfield, Ohio, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we can't take them for granted Friday night," Jordan said. "But 
we're in our atmosphere, so we can control our own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
John Williams, scoring 16 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter, kept the 
Cavaliers in contention. Cleveland pulled within 91-88 with 2:43 to play, but 
Jordan converted a three-point play. With 1:04 left, he stole the ball and went 
in for a slam dunk, making the score 96-88. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said that although he had been driving to the basket repeatedly without 
drawing fouls, he planned his final three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to initiate the contact and then I jumped and made the shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland narrowed the score to 97-94, but Jordan's four free throws in the 
last 21 seconds sealed the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries hurt Cleveland. Mark Price has injured hamstrings and was held to two 
points and four assists. Craig Ehlo suffered a sprained ankle in practice and 
did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 126, Seattle 107 -- Sleepy Floyd scored 28 points, including 22 in the

Seattle has a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five first-round series, with the fourth 
game scheduled Friday night at Houston. A fifth game, if necessary, would be 
played in Seattle Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who had six assists and set a club playoff record with three straight 
three-point baskets, got the Rockets off to a fast start with 10 first-quarter 
points. He scored 12 points in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who shot poorly in the first two games of the series, made eight of 11 
shots, including all three of his three-point attempts. Akeem Olajuwon had 19 
points and 18 rebounds for Houston, and Otis Thorpe added 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Sleepy was the key," Rocket Coach Don Chaney said. "Akeem always has his game, 
but Sleepy got us running on all cylinders." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis, playing despite a broken nose that resulted in him wearing a 
protective brace, led Seattle with 26 points, and Sedale Threatt added 17. 
</P>
<P>
There were five technical fouls, four against the Sonics. Olajuwon was called 
for a technical with 4:03 to go in the second quarter after throwing a ball at 
Seattle forward Michael Cage. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon and Cage were fined for fighting in a regular-season game in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Alton Lister, Ellis, Xavier McDaniel and Cage were assessed technical fouls for 
the Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said the Sonics were intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"They spent the night kicking our tails and we spent the night bitching at 
officials," Bickerstaff said.

For the second straight game, Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy had a streak 
ended. He liked the result a lot better this time. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, whose 34-game home unbeaten string ended in Game 1 of the Wales Conference 
finals, snapped a nine-game winless slump against Philadelphia with his second 
career playoff shutout Wednesday night as the Canadiens evened the series with 
a 3-0 victory over the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Every good thing has to come to an end," Roy said of his unbeaten streak at 
the Forum. "Tonight was a confidence-builder. I hadn't beaten the Flyers, but I 
was very comfortable out there tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Roy, 0-4-5 previously against the Flyers -- including 0-3 in the playoffs -- 
stopped 24 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wanted to shut people up, and he did" defenseman Craig Ludwig said of 
Roy. "Going to Philadelphia down, 2-0, would have been tough." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's Stephane Richer scored during a 5-on-3 advantage in the first 
period, and rookie defenseman Eric Desjardins added a power-play goal in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Carbonneau scored in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Flyer goaltender Ken Wregget, who faced 39 shots, played his third straight 
game in place of Ron Hextall, who is out with a knee injury.

VETERANS BELIEVE THEY CAN END GORDON'S DOMINATION IN STADIUM RACES 
</P>

<P>
As the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Championship Series enters the second half of 
its season Saturday night at the Rose Bowl, the question at hand is: Can the 
truck-driving old-timers stop the kid from winning it all? 
</P>
<P>
Robby Gordon, 20, in his first year of stadium truck racing, has finished first 
in four of the five previous Grand National Sports Truck races, although he was 
penalized for rough driving in one of his victories and dropped to third place. 
In the one race he failed to win, Gordon was also penalized, for rough driving 
in a heat, and forced to start last in the feature. He finished third. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus among his peers is that Gordon is very good, has unusually strong 
equipment in the Toyota truck prepared by Cal Wells and has also been very 
lucky. 
</P>
<P>
From Walker Evans, 50, the dean of off-road racers, through a group of proven 
winners such as Roger Mears, Glenn Harris, Danny Thompson and David Ashley, the 
feeling is that Gordon can be beaten -- and each one thinks individually that 
he is the one to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Toyota was dominant in the first four races, but we got our act together in 
Houston and beat them and I feel good about coming to the Rose Bowl," Evans 
said. "I guess Saturday night will be the time to prove we can do it again, but 
we'll have to drive fast and hard." 
</P>
<P>
It was Evans' Jeep that Gordon hit in Seattle, the incident prompting the 
Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group's committee on rough driving to take 
Gordon's win from him. And it was Evans he hit again in Houston, putting him in 
the rear of the field in the main event. 
</P>
<P>
"I just seem to be the one in his way the most, but the other guys will tell 
you, too, that some of his driving is not totally gentlemanly," Evans said. 
"He's leaned on a lot of guys and that doesn't sit too well with his 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, he's talented and knows how to get to the front and win 
races. You can't take that away from him." 
</P>
<P>
Evans and the others figure that a new system of lining up the field for the 
main event will help their cause. For the first four races, starting positions 
were determined by a blind draw. Since the race in Houston, though, the grid 
has been determined by a points system involving qualifying and two heats. 
</P>
<P>
"Gordon had a lot of luck going for him with the draws," Evans said. "As lucky 
as he was, he should be in Las Vegas. Now to get up front in the main event, 
you've got to earn the spot. He might be up there, but he'll have to work for 
it, and the new way will make for a much better show because qualifying and the 
heats mean a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Mears, 41, likened the Toyota domination by Gordon and Ivan Stewart to that of 
the Penske Indy car team, of which Roger's younger brother, Rick, is a member. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got the combination right now, the way Penske had it last year at 
Indy," Mears said. "Racing seems to be like that, one team getting dominant, 
but it always ends, and we hope to be the ones to end it for Toyota." 
</P>
<P>
Mears has a streak of six straight second-place finishes in his Nissan pickup 
-- three in desert races and three in stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
"After the disastrous year we had in 1988, second places felt pretty good, but 
winning will feel a lot better," he said. "We feel we have the right stuff to 
beat them, and the Rose Bowl might be the place to start. We got our last win 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Mears won 16 of 25 stadium races in 1984 and '85, but since then has won only 
once -- in the Rose Bowl in '87. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 30, also said that the Rose Bowl will be good for his independently 
campaigned Mazda. He won his first truck race there in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rose Bowl course is a favorite of mine," Harris said. "When I won there, I 
considered it a major breakthrough, a landmark win if you will. With the new 
format, consistency will pay off and that means keeping the right attitude all 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that Gordon's on a roll, but if I didn't think I could beat him, 
there wouldn't be any sense in showing up." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 38, is looking for his first win in his privately funded Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley, 31, drives the lone Ford Ranger in the truck class and hopes a return 
to Southern California will help his chances. Ashley, who won in a Jeep in the 
Coliseum two years ago, was leading in the opening race at Anaheim before 
rolling in a multi-truck collision. 
</P>
<P>
Truck standings: 1. Gordon, Orange, Toyota, 282 points; 2. Stewart, Lakeside, 
Toyota, 199; 3. Evans, Riverside, Jeep, 194; 4. Harris, Camarillo, Mazda, 179; 
5. Thompson, Huntington Beach, Chevrolet, 156; 6. Rob MacCachren, Las Vegas, 
Jeep, 134; 7. Ashley, Placentia, Ford, 113. 
</P>
<P>
Racing will start Saturday at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- Perennial champion Sleepy Tripp finally gained the lead in the 
United States Auto Club's Western Regional championship series with a win last

defending series champion Roy Smith. The next Winston West race will be May 13 
at Bakersfield's Mesa Marin Raceway. 
</P>
<P>

2000 season Sunday at Sears Point Raceway, along with the Sports Car Club of 
America's Trans Am main event. Drivers representing 15 cities will compete in 
10 races. The Los Angeles team includes Carlos Bobeda, Malcom Harding and Rod 
Everett, with Jim Paul, Allen Riggle and Larry Harvey driving for Long Beach. 
The skiing Mahre brothers, Steve and Phil, will drive for Reno. 
</P>
<P>
A goal of $135,000 has been established for a memorial scholarship in the name

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: LISA LESLIE AND THE BURGES TWINS SPARKLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the high school level, 6-foot-5 Lisa Leslie of Morningside and 6-4 twins 
Heidi and Heather Burge of Palos Verdes are dominant basketball players. Their 
size and athletic ability set them apart from most of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
But what would happen if Leslie and the Burges had to face college players who 
are older, more physically mature and, in some cases, equal in size? 
</P>
<P>
The three prep stars found out last weekend when they were among 70 college and 
28 high school players who tried out for 10 spots on the 20-and-under U.S. 
Olympic Festival West team at Chapman College in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Leslie and the Burges proved themselves equal to the task 
during a demanding three days of tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Burge was the only high school player selected to the West team by a 
panel of college coaches, sister Heather was named one of three alternates and 
Leslie earned a shot at making the elite Junior National team. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, assured of making one of the four Olympic Festival teams, was one of 
three players -- the others were Penny Moore of Cal State Long Beach and Julie 
Zeilstra of Stanford -- chosen to try out for the Junior National team June 4-7 
at Colorado Springs. If she makes that cut, she will participate in the World 
Junior Games in Spain this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for an Inglewood schoolgirl who, as a junior this season, led the Lady 
Monarchs to the state Division I championship and received enough awards to 
fill a trophy case. She was named the state Player of the Year by Cal-Hi 
Sports, The Times South Bay Player of the Year and the Southern Section 5-AA 
Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"For Lisa Leslie to be invited to try out for the Junior National team as a 
junior in high school is just outstanding," said Palos Verdes Coach Wendell 
Yoshida, who conducted some of the drills at the Olympic Festival tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The trials were brutal. They brought out the best in all of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
They also brought out a few bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside Coach Frank Scott, who assisted at the trials, said the rough play 
caught Leslie by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"They pushed her around in the early going," he said. "I told her she had to 
bang right back. And she did, especially on the last day. Now she knows what to 
expect in college. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a war out there. Every time they took the ball inside, I was afraid 
someone was going to lose an arm. Nothing came cheap." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida said the Virginia-bound Burges also took their lumps. 
</P>
<P>
"Heidi had ice packs on her face by the end of Saturday night from all the 
elbows being thrown," he said. "It was cutthroat." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the competition, many outstanding players failed to survive all four 
cuts. All-Southern Section guard JoJo Witherspoon of Morningside and University 
of Washington forward Shaunda Greene, the 1988 Southern Section 4-A Division 
Co-Player of the Year at Morningside, were eliminated after the third cut. 
</P>
<P>
Those who made it will compete in the Olympic Festival in July at Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Bishop Montgomery pitcher Armando Cervantes has been a pleasant 
surprise for Coach Bob Anderson would be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore right-hander, considered a promising newcomer before the season, 
has emerged as the ace of a balanced staff with a 5-0 record, one save, a 1.30 
ERA and 58 strikeouts in 48 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he would be a dominant pitcher in the South Bay by the time he was a 
senior, possibly by the end of his junior year, but I never expected him to be 
doing as well as he is now," Anderson said. "He wants the ball in the big 
games. His poise and mound presence are just amazing for his age." 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Cervantes was at his best Saturday, tossing a two-hitter and 
striking out 10 in a 2-1 victory over St. Paul. The win moved Bishop Montgomery 
closer to clinching third place and qualifying for the playoffs from the 
Angelus League for the first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the Knights have never qualified for the playoffs from the 
competitive Angelus League in baseball, basketball or football. The Torrance 
school has been in the league for 14 years of its 31-year existence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Erik Russell was expected to be Bishop Montgomery's top 
pitcher, but he's now considered more of an offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
Entering this week, Russell led the Knights with a .393 batting average (22 for 
56) and two home runs. He delivered the game-winning single in the seventh 
inning Saturday against St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Russell's impressive hitting has helped compensate for an unimpressive year of 
pitching. The 6-foot-3, 190-pounder, who was an All-Angelus League pitching 
selection last year, is 2-3 with a 2.55 ERA and has fallen out of the Knights' 
regular rotation. He starts in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says Russell's problems have been twofold: a lack of confidence and 
trouble making the transition from reliever to starter. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he pitches well, he has confidence," the coach said. "When he's 
uneasy about himself, he never throws well. That's going to be the biggest 
hurdle for him. When he walks out there every time with confidence, I sure 
don't want to be facing him." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the hard-throwing Russell is being recruited as a pitcher by 
Arizona State and Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think his future is as a pitcher," he said. "The kid's got a great 
arm. He just needs confidence when he's on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne continued to roll toward the Bay League softball title Tuesday with a 
10-1 victory over Rolling Hills as senior pitcher Tricia Waayers threw a 
one-hitter, struck out nine and batted three for four with an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Waayers (13-2) and the Cougars' other pitcher, Lisa Smith (6-0), have been 
nearly unhittable this season. In 97 innings, Waayers has 11 complete games, 
149 strikeouts and has allowed six earned runs for an 0.43 ERA. Smith, the No. 
2 starter, has given up only one earned run in 43 innings for an 0.16 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Erica Henderson leads four teammates hitting over .300 with a .429 average. 
Hawthorne, ranked No. 9 in the Southern Section 4-A Division coaches' poll, is 
20-2 overall and 10-1 in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
How's this for parity: 
</P>
<P>
One game separates the top six teams in the Bay League baseball race, and seven 
of the eight teams have a chance to earn a berth in the Southern Section 5-A 
playoffs with three games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes and Beverly Hills are tied for first place with 7-4 
records, while Torrance, Hawthorne and Santa Monica are one game back in a 
three-way tie for fourth with 6-5 marks. Leuzinger is three games off the pace 
at 4-7 and has only a slim chance of finishing among the top three. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, winner of eight of its last 10 games, maintained its hot streak 
Tuesday by handing Rolling Hills its third straight league defeat, 8-4, behind 
the hitting and pitching of Mike Kendall, who homered and went the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills did its part to tighten the race by handing Palos Verdes a 15-4 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
In pivotal rematches today, Beverly Hills plays at Palos Verdes and Rolling 
Hills visits Torrance in 3 p.m. games. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Despite losing in the quarterfinals of the Redondo/Mira Costa 
Varsity Classic on Saturday, Mira Costa's volleyball team retained its No. 1 
ranking in the Southern Section 4-A coaches' poll. Tournament champion Corona 
del Mar jumped from fourth to third in the poll and runner-up Loyola went from 
seventh to fifth. Previously unranked Newport Harbor, which handed Mira Costa a 
16-14 loss, cracked the top 10 at No. 9. Mira Costa rebounded from the loss by 
clinching the Ocean League title Tuesday with a 15-1, 15-2 sweep over West 
Torrance. The Mustangs are 17-1 overall and 13-0 in league play. . . . Mary 
Star's baseball team extended its winning streak to 13 games Tuesday with a 
10-4 triumph over Pater Noster to improve to 8-0 in the Santa Fe League and 
16-5 overall. Rich Negrete, Miguel Galaz and George Pisano each drove in two 
runs. . . . San Pedro and Banning kept pace with each other for the Pacific 
League baseball lead with victories Tuesday. Dale Johnson and Arnold Madrid 
each drove in two runs to lead San Pedro past Narbonne, 8-2, and right-hander 
Chico Limas struck out 13 in Banning's 12-4 win over Washington. The rivals, 
who tied for the Pacific League crown last year, meet May 16 in a 
regular-season finale at Banning. . . . Banning softball pitcher Kricket Kern 
shut out San Pedro, 2-0, Tuesday to force a tie between the teams for first 
place in the Pacific League with one game remaining, each with an 8-1 record. 
Since the teams split their head-to-head meetings, if both win their league 
finales today, a tie-breaker would be played Monday to decide first place and a 
bye in the first round of the L.A. City playoffs.

N. TORRANCE REVENGES MIRA COSTA DEFEAT IN OCEAN 'PAY-BACK,' 9-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North Torrance High School has not officially adopted "Pay-Back Time" as its 
rallying cry for the second half of the baseball season. It just appears that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The Saxons, left for dead in the Ocean League less than a month ago after an 
8-7 loss to Mira Costa, continued their steady climb to the top Wednesday with 
a 9-7 come-from-behind victory over Mira Costa at North. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive game in which North avenged a loss, following 
pay-back wins over Culver City, Redondo and Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, though, it was the Saxons' seventh straight league victory 
and vaulted them into undisputed second place with an 8-3 record behind Ocean 
leader Culver City (10-1). 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Neily, whose club was 1-3 and in sixth place after its loss to Mira 
Costa on April 7, has a considerably brighter outlook today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in great position (to make the playoffs)," he said. "We had high 
expectations right from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
The remaining schedule does appear to favor North. The Saxons complete the 
regular season against three teams in the bottom half of the Ocean standings: 
Centennial, West Torrance and South Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa, which dropped into third place at 7-4, has a tougher road to the 
playoffs, finishing against Culver City and Redondo next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some tough games ahead of us," said Jim Beaumont, Mira Costa's 
first-year coach. "But at least we're in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
The pesky Mustangs, who have been somewhat of a surprise this season, gave 
North all it could handle Wednesday. They held leads of 4-3 and 7-6 in a seesaw 
game, the second advantage courtesy of Sandy Sarconi's three-run home run to 
left field in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
But North didn't let Mira Costa enjoy its good fortune for long. 
</P>
<P>
The Saxons (13-9-1 overall) battled back to register their 10th win in the last 
11 games. They went ahead for good, 8-7, with two runs in the fifth on a 
sacrifice fly by Brad Taggart and a run-scoring single by Scott Diekmann and 
added an insurance run in the sixth on Bo Monson's RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
That proved enough of a cushion for sophomore Damon Stephenson, who pitched 
three innings of shutout relief to notch his third victory in three games since 
being called up from the junior varsity team. The right-hander relieved starter 
Ty Tout, who surrendered 10 hits and seven runs, with no outs and one runner on 
base in the fifth and did not give up a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"For a 15-year-old kid, he throws strikes," Neily said. "That's the name of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
North benefited from two misplayed fly balls to score three runs in each of the 
first two innings. John Clem's seemingly routine fly fell behind right fielder 
Mark Earnest for a two-run double in the first and Tony Pruett's long drive in 
the second turned around center fielder Scott Vandermark, resulting in a 
three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't get there," Beaumont said of the fly balls, which he thought 
should have been caught. "But North hit the ball. They hit the ball pretty well 
the first time we played them. I didn't see anything different." 
</P>
<P>
Pruett finished three for three with three runs scored, three RBIs and two 
stolen bases for North, while Monson went three for four with two runs scored. 
The Saxons stole four bases, giving them 115 steals on the season. 
</P>
<P>
Sarconi had a big day for Mira Costa (11-7 overall), finishing two for three 
with five RBIs. His two-run single highlighted a four-run second inning.

UMPIRE DEFENDS WALKOUT; 
</P>
<P>
VETERAN OFFICIAL SAYS ABUSE FROM CSUN PROMPTED DEPARTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran umpire who walked off the field during the sixth inning of a 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball game between Cal State Northridge 
and UC Riverside said Wednesday that he did so because it was his only 
recourse. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hernandez, who has umpired at the collegiate level for 13 years, departed 
Tuesday's game, which Northridge eventually won, 12-10, after several ejections 
and a bizarre play. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who was the base umpire, said that plate umpire Frank Mason, a 
20-year veteran, should have called a forfeit after Northridge coaches had 
become abusive and violated NCAA rules by communicating with their players and 
the umpires after their ejections. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my 15 years of officiating at all levels have I been subjected to 
something like that," said Hernandez, who is scheduled to work a Division I 
regional and is an alternate for the Division I World Series. "There's 
something called professionalism, and yesterday there was no professionalism on 
that field. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how it would have ended if I had stayed. . . . If I had it to do 
over again, I'd do the exact same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Mason declined comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Williams, president of the Southern California Collegiate Baseball Umpires 
Assn. and in his 31st year as an umpire, said he could not recall a similar 
incident at the collegiate level. Tom Morgan, the commissioner of the CCAA, 
said that Hernandez's exodus was a first for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a black eye for all of us," Riverside Coach Jack Smitheran said. 
</P>
<P>
The chain of events that led to Hernandez's departure began in the fifth inning 
of the game at the Riverside Sports Complex and featured the ejections of 
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen, Northridge assistant Randy Day and Northridge 
players Greg Shockey and Anton Siegl. 
</P>
<P>
With none out in the fifth and Northridge leading, 5-3, Matador baserunner 
Chae-Ho Chong collided with Riverside second baseman John Holmes as Holmes 
attempted to field a ground ball hit by Rusty McLain. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, 48, appeared to have ruled that no interference had occurred. 
Smitheran approached Hernandez, and, after a short discussion, Hernandez called 
Chong out. 
</P>
<P>
Day, the third-base coach, and Kernen were both ejected for arguing vehemently 
about the call. Kernen said he objected to the call being reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer that the coaches coach and the umpires umpire," Kernen said. "I 
don't think I would have argued if he (Hernandez) made the call. All I ask him 
to do is make his own call and we'll live with the result." 
</P>
<P>
Shockey, a freshman center fielder, was ejected by Hernandez later in the 
inning for arguing after he was thrown out at second trying to stretch a single 
into a double. 
</P>
<P>
The climactic event, however, was triggered in the sixth inning when Northridge 
third baseman Greg Hansen bobbled a ground ball and accidentally hit Hernandez 
with an off-line throw to first that enabled Riverside to score a run. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, after being hit by the throw, was subjected to a verbal hailstorm 
from Kernen, who was seated in the bleachers behind the Northridge dugout. 
According to NCAA rules, an ejected player or coach must leave the field and 
dugout area immediately and is not allowed to communicate with his team or the 
umpires. Failure to abide by the rule is grounds for forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said that Day communicated with Northridge players after being 
ejected but that he did not take action "to give the players the benefit of the 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said that while Kernen was berating him, he indicated to Mason three 
times that a forfeit should be called. Mason, who as plate umpire had sole 
authority to forfeit the game, did not acknowledge the request. Hernandez then 
departed, leaving Mason to finish the game by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"When a person (Kernen) is in a tirade like that, there is no telling what can 
happen," Hernandez said. "There's no other way to keep control. The only 
recourse you have after they've been ejected is call for a forfeit." 
</P>
<P>
"If the shoe would have been on the other foot, I would have walked with my 
partner." 
</P>
<P>
Siegl was ejected in the seventh after hitting Riverside first baseman Logan 
Ostrander with a forearm while running out a grounder. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said that as far as he is concerned the entire incident is over. 
Kernen agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a historical event as far as I'm concerned," Kernen said. 
"Meaning, it's in the past."

OCCIDENTAL BASKETBALL JOB TAKEN BY NEWHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Newhall, interim basketball coach at Occidental College last season, 
confirmed Wednesday that he will accept an offer to coach the team on a 
permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely going to take it. I just need to work out the details," said 
Newhall, an Occidental graduate who took over for Bill Westphal last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall, 28, served as an assistant and junior varsity coach for two years 
under Westphal, who now coaches at Grand Canyon College in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Last season -- Newhall's first as a head coach -- the Tigers (15-10,5-5) 
finished in a tie for third in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference. In 1987-88, Occidental was 12-14 overall and 4-6 in conference 
play, and the previous year the team finished 13-13 and 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
David Axeen, dean of students, said that the reaction from the Occidental 
community toward Newhall's performance as coach was positive. 
</P>
<P>
"He took over in a difficult situation and not only maintained the continuity 
of the team but actually made progress," Axeen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased to give Brian the job. He was my student and I think very 
highly of him." 
</P>
<P>
Newhall said that recruiting in the midst of the search was difficult because 
he could not guarantee prospects that he would be coaching next season. 
</P>
<P>
"You get hurt on recruiting because (the position is) being advertised all 
over," he said. "It was really distracting." 
</P>
<P>
The search committee of 10 included administrators and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, one combined vote was given to players Chris Anderson, Stephen 
Bertz, Nate Thompson and Brett Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall's most ardent backing might have come from the players. 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson: "We weren't going to use it as a threat, but it was to the point 
where some of us were saying if he didn't get the job we were going to go 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way, without Brian, that we would have a chance at winning. Not 
with someone we don't even know and who doesn't know us." 
</P>
<P>
Although seven players return for their senior season, Newhall will have to 
fill the void left by starting guard Jason Greenstein and all-conference 
forward John Keister, who averaged a team-high 23 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1982-83 season, Newhall played point guard for the Tigers, averaged 15 
points and six assists a game and was named Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental finished 10-2 in conference play that season -- the last year it won 
a conference title.

SWINTON IMPROVES STUDY SKILLS AFTER PROVING FOOTBALL TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Swinton did not have to block any linebackers or smash headfirst into the 
middle of the USC line, but the Washington State running back is likely to 
remember this semester as the toughest of his college career. 
</P>
<P>
A former National Merit Scholar at Montclair Prep, Swinton was one of five 
Cougars forced to sit out spring practice after his grade-point average dropped 
below 2.0 last fall. All five players were placed on academic probation and 
forced to reapply for admission to the university. 
</P>
<P>
Local papers had a field day with the scandal. One story about Swinton in the 
Spokane (Wash.) Spokesman-Review was headlined: "Success gives Swinton an empty 
head." 
</P>
<P>
"I was really upset about that," said Swinton, a sophomore who rushed for 1,018 
yards last fall. "I didn't think that was fair. I'm not used to having 
personal-type stuff in the papers." 
</P>
<P>
But Swinton concedes that Washington State's surprising 9-3 season -- the 
school's best since 1930 -- was partly responsible for his academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington State doesn't win like that. We were winning and you just forget to 
go to class," Swinton said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're physically tired all the time. If you don't get used to going to class 
when you're tired -- and you have to get used to it as a freshman -- then in 
later years you're not going to change." 
</P>
<P>
Swinton did change one thing -- his major, from business to sociology. And last 
Saturday he passed his first two finals of the semester. "I needed to get my 
head on straight," he said. "I didn't know it would come to this. I didn't 
completely bomb out, but I bombed out enough to where I needed to be punished." 
</P>
<P>
Game on the brink: Northridge pitcher Fili Martinez finally got over the .500 
mark Tuesday with his complete-game performance against UC Riverside, but he 
didn't do it in the style to which he is accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, a senior left-hander, improved his record to 6-5 but allowed 17 hits, 
including two home runs and three triples, in a game that featured the ejection 
of two players and two coaches, the puzzling exit of an umpire and a three-run 
homer by pinch-hitter Denny Vigo that gave the Matadors a 12-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have my stuff today and it showed," said Martinez who had given 
up just 67 hits in 94 innings entering the game. "I was struggling -- just too 
high-strung at the start. I started settling down, but then all those crazy 
things started happening." 
</P>
<P>
Going bananas: Paul Xanthos has traditionally taught his tennis players not to 
flinch when confronted with stiff competition. 
</P>
<P>
But in the quarterfinals of the Ojai Valley tournament last Friday, the Pierce 
College coach suggested that his top doubles team give ground to its opponent, 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Two feet of ground, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
Sang Kim and Mason Harris -- a team formed only a week earlier -- were 
consistently getting burned by the top-spin serve of Brian Beach, who was 
capitalizing on the Pierce pair's backhand shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
Xanthos suggested the two assume an open stance when returning service, 
therefore making a shot to the forehand more tempting for Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The ploy worked and Sang and Kim came back to defeat Beach and Ruben Castrejon, 
6-7, 7-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one move and I was laughing," Xanthos said. "It was just a hunch. I 
never expected the server to go bananas." 
</P>
<P>
Brahma bravado: Pierce's hopes of qualifying for the Western State Conference 
Shaughnessy baseball tournament already had been squelched, but the Brahmas did 
not lack motivation Monday in their regular-season finale against Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
With a win, Pierce could have prevented Canyons from winning or sharing its 
ninth consecutive WSC title. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were 0-12 we would still come out to play Canyons," said Scott 
Cadenhead, Pierce's designated-hitter. "We wanted to play these guys to knock 
them out of the title." 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas came close, but Canyons rallied for six runs in the seventh inning 
and won, 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
Sting operation: Don Pedersen had a rough day Saturday, even before he played 
first base for College of the Canyons in a game against Valley. 
</P>
<P>
First, Pedersen was stung by a bee on his left forearm. He was stung again when 
he fouled a pitch off his right foot during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the stings, he took his swings, hitting a single, flying out twice, 
grounding out and drawing a walk. Pedersen also made three sparkling plays on 
ground balls. 
</P>
<P>
But he missed Canyons' final regular-season game against Pierce on Monday after 
his left hand stiffened because of a reaction from the bee sting. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen was back in the lineup Tuesday for Canyons' first-round Western State 
Conference playoff game against Moorpark, just in time to go one for four and 
ground into two double plays as the Cougars were upset, 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
Hail to the Chief: Kris Kaelin, designated-hitter for Moorpark's baseball team, 
is the tall and quiet type. As a result, he carries the nickname "Chief." 
</P>
<P>
"Chief" was a character in the movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." But 
other than being 6-foot-5 and rather reserved, Kaelin would prefer to believe 
the resemblance ends there. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the movie character was a patient in a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A shape-shooter: Lance Harper missed seven Northridge football games last fall 
because of a knee injury and the Matadors, who finished with a 6-5 record, lost 
five of them. Harper, a former All-City Section player at San Fernando High, 
alternated at tailback with Albert Fann before injuring a knee in the season's 
fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
He finally underwent arthroscopic surgery in February -- more than four months 
after hobbling off the artificial surface at Idaho State. While rehabilitating 
the knee, Harper missed most of spring football practice and sat out a 
full-contact public scrimmage on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who will be a senior, lifted weights and managed to take part in some 
bag drills during the final two weeks of practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take my time and make sure that when I come back I'm 100%, just like 
when I left," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Rest for the wounded: Cal Lutheran will play a nonconference men's tennis match 
today at UC Riverside, then has a week off before beginning defense of its NAIA 
District 3 title. The Kingsmen need all the time they can get to allow their 
wounded to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Top singles players Paavo Salmi (sore ankle) and Mike Genette (strained 
Achilles' tendon) have been injured but both are expected to be healthy for the 
district tournament, which begins May 11 at Christ College in Irvine.

UP-AND-COMING TENNIS PROGRAMS SUCH AS SDSU'S WONDER HOW TO CONTINUE THE ASCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arizona State and San Diego State are 350 miles and a desert apart. The 
climates are almost ideal during the college tennis season -- mild and dry. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches of the women's teams have built their programs from the ground up. 
San Diego State's Carol Plunkett and Arizona State's Sheila McInerney recruit 
the same type of player -- often the same players -- but have the same problem: 
They sometimes seem to be fighting a losing battle against the upper echelon 
tennis schools, such as Stanford, UCLA, USC, Cal and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Both schools are consistently ranked among the nation's top 20, sometimes among 
the top 10, but neither has been able to break into the elite five. 
</P>
<P>
Today, ASU and SDSU are expected to receive bids for the NCAA team 
championships in Gainesville, Fla., which begin May 10. ASU is ranked ninth, 
SDSU 16th. 
</P>
<P>
ASU's highest finish was eighth in 1987. SDSU's was fourth in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Why has neither fared better? 
</P>
<P>
While the USCs and Stanfords pick from a list of 20 blue-chip junior players, 
McInerney and Plunkett must chase those with promise instead of solid 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're forced to recruit on potential," said Plunkett, who is in her 13th year 
at SDSU. "We recruit the 40th- or 50th-best players. We look for the players 
who love to compete. If you have talent but not a competitive mind, then it's 
not going to serve you well." 
</P>
<P>
McInerney also recruits the "good attitude, hard-worker," but not by choice. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could get the No. 1 kid, I'm sure we would put up with some of the 
attitude problems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Plunkett has been unable to steer any of the top California juniors 
away from the Pac 10 powers, she has been forced to recruit out of state, and 
even out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Her No. 2 player is Kristin Hill of Palatine, Ill.; No. 4 is Jessica Buss of 
Great Neck, N.Y.; No. 6 is Claire Bateman of Essex, England; No. 7 is Eva 
Olivarez of Manila, Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Plunkett also says SDSU's inferior courts discourage top talent. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a better facility," she said. "There's no comparison with our courts 
and those schools. We resurface our courts every five to seven years, while 
they're doing it every year." 
</P>
<P>
ASU has a large, newly refurbished tennis complex. And it has been making 
progress in joining the privileged group -- the Sun Devils beat USC last year 
-- but McInerney still feels she's got a way to go before she joins the "in 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty much in the same ballpark as San Diego State," said McInerney, 
who has been in Tempe five years. "We've gotten stronger, and we're getting 
comparable. My goal is to get a top 10 program and then move up from there. I'd 
like to get into that hierarchy." 
</P>
<P>
So would Plunkett. And although she says the athletic administration has never 
pressured her into joining that elite group, she has put it on herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel as much pressure to win as you'll feel anywhere," Plunkett said. "I'm 
evaluated whether I win or lose. But in this city, if you want support, you 
have to win. I feel a responsibility. If I get a little more money than the 
softball program, I feel it's my responsibility to put a good product out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to lose, it's the pits. If I was flipping burgers at McDonald's, I want 
to flip more than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
That mentality has carried over to her players. 
</P>
<P>
Sondra Mitchell at No. 1 singles is the prototype Plunkett player, although, 
Plunkett didn't even have to recruit her. Mitchell came to her as a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
"She has phenomenal mental strength," Plunkett said of the 1988 Big West player 
of the year and the MVP of last weekend's Big West tournament in Ojai. "She is 
just an absolute hard worker. She's not the most physically gifted player, but 
she won't beat herself. You're going to have to beat her." 
</P>
<P>
By Mitchell's sophomore year, she had earned a partial scholarship. Last year, 
Plunkett offered her a full ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to play for a good team and play against good competition so I 
could improve my tennis," said Mitchell, who played No. 1 singles at Capistrano 
Valley High in Orange County. "'I never imagined I'd be playing this well." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell credits much of her improvement to Plunkett. 
</P>
<P>
"She changed my game, even though I didn't want to," Mitchell said. "I wanted 
to go to the fence (play from the baseline) and hit my ground strokes because I 
couldn't hit the rises." 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell adapted her game the way Plunkett has adapted her program. 
Plunkett said she has had several opportunities to run for the fence, but each 
time she has come to the net. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my program," she said. "I've built it. If I leave it will not be to take 
another college coaching position but to go another direction." 
</P>
<P>
Plunkett hopes the only direction SDSU women's tennis goes is up. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
The 14th-ranked University of San Diego's women's program is also expected to 
receive a NCAA bid, as are the USD men.

the second quarter ended March 31. Revenue for the quarter increased 46% to 
$157 million, contrasted with $107.5 million for the period the year before. 
For the 6-month period, net income increased 25% to $3.2 million, contrasted 
with $2.5 million for the period for the previous year. Revenue was $283.8 
million, up 42% from $199.6 million. PacifiCare, which operates HMOs in four 
western states and also sells health insurance plans, said increased costs for 
health care and overhead kept earnings from increasing during the second 
quarter. The company said membership in its HMOs has increased by nearly 
150,000 in the past year, with about 430,000 members enrolled as of March 31.

its first-quarter performance in 1989 was significantly below 1988 results

ART BUCHWALD: SLICK VALDEZ CULPRIT SLIPS OFF THE HOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Time magazine, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has 
complained that news coverage of the Exxon oil spill was slanted. Instead of 
concentrating on the 240,000 barrels of crude that escaped the tanker, the real 
story was how Exxon and the government saved another 1 million barrels from 
escaping into the sea. Sununu is quoted in Time as saying, "Three-quarters of 
it was contained within the ship. There's been very little reporting on that." 
</P>
<P>
It so happens that Sununu is right. I wrote that story soon after the Exxon 
Valdez hit the rocks but nobody would print it. 
</P>
<P>
So here it is again: 
</P>
<P>
There was a miracle in Prince William Sound yesterday when one of the largest 
oil tankers in the world went aground and ruptured on the rocks near the Port 
of Valdez. Only 240,000 barrels of crude oil escaped from its tanks before 
valiant Exxon damage-control people managed to pump oil into another tanker. 
</P>
<P>
An oil-spill expert said that barely 800 miles of shoreline would be affected 
by the spill, as opposed to the entire West Coast of the United States, if 
everyone had not been so on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters, "You have here an example of how the combination of 
seamanship and teamwork was able to turn what could have been a major disaster 
into a piddling incident. All credit goes to the captain of the Exxon Valdez. 
Even though he had been in his cabin, he decided to go out on deck after the 
accident and save his ship. A grateful nation owes him a debt for salvaging 1 
million barrels of much-needed fuel." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if anyone was to blame for the spill, the expert replied, "Only if 
the press insists on writing stories about the oil lost to the sea instead of 
what is now safely inside the tanker. If the media want to be fair they should 
focus on how many birds and otters are still alive because 1 million barrels of 
oil were not spilled. As long as the TV cameras keep filming oil-soaked geese, 
the true story of the heroic Valdez will never be told." 
</P>
<P>
One TV reporter said, "What about the oil on the beaches? Is it all right to 
concentrate on that?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you show pictures of the black gold that was pumped off the Exxon 
Valdez? You don't help people feel any better by always illustrating the 
downside of what happens when a tanker runs aground. Everybody makes mistakes, 
but there is absolutely no reason to draw attention to them with pictures of 
workers wiping off rocks with damp towels." 
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, no one is sure how long it will take for the oil spill 
carnage to be cleaned up. However, everyone is pleased with the smoothness of 
the operation, especially when compared with how long it would have taken if 
all the oil on board had leaked. 
</P>
<P>
The expert continued, "It's true that it looks bad from the air, but that's 
just because oil and water don't mix. All of us would have preferred not to 
have had an accident, but if there is one and only 25% of your cargo is lost, 
anyone can live with that." 
</P>
<P>
He was then asked, "Knowing what you know now, is there anything we can do to 
make this a kinder, gentler Alaska?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's no good dwelling on incidents such as oil spills. You have to look at a 
grounded tanker as you do a glass of water, and ask yourself if it's half full 
or half empty. That's what oil spills are all about."

FAMILY TREE: TRIBUTE TO IMMIGRANT ANCESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA V. GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ellis Island Immigrant Museum, currently under construction and scheduled 
to open this fall or early in 1990, will tell the story of the largest human 
migration in modern history. Part of this unique exhibit will be the Immigrant 
Wall of Honor -- devoted solely to the display of thousands of names of 
immigrants who came to America during the past four centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1892 and 1954, 17 million immigrants were processed at Ellis Island. 
Today more than 40%, or about 100 million, of all living Americans can trace 
their roots to an ancestor who came through Ellis Island. It was there in 
various rooms of the main building where these new arrivals -- often fearful of 
rejection -- were processed, inspected and eventually granted permission to 
enter this country. The Immigrant Museum, located in the 200,000-square-foot 
main building where so many of our immigrant ancestors first set foot in 
America, will offer visitors a complete look at the total immigrant experience 
by use of innovative displays that feature historic artifacts, photographs, 
computers and taped oral histories of the immigrants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigrant Wall of Honor will pay tribute to all our ancestors -- whether 
they arrived at Ellis Island from Italy on the Verona in 1909, came on the 
Mayflower in 1620 to Massachusetts or from Germany to Galveston, Tex., in the 
middle of the 19th Century. By making a $100 tax-deductible contribution to 
restore Ellis Island you can have the name you designate permanently placed on 
the Wall of Honor. In addition, all names will be entered, together with a 
country of origin and the name of the donor, in a computer register located in 
the same room. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, more than 70,000 
names have already been submitted -- including the ancestors of First Lady 
Barbara Bush and entertainer Neil Diamond. Among the names are such famous 
progenitors of many American lines as Miles Standish, of Plymouth Colony, and 
William Bradford, governor of Plymouth colony and Pilgrim leader. 
</P>
<P>
Your ancestors' names can be part of this exhibit also. Many have chosen to 
honor their parents, great-grandparents or their family name. You may register 
any name of your choosing, as it is not necessary that it be the name of your 
immigrant ancestor. When honoring a family name, the foundation recommends you 
use a first and last name (i.e. the William Johnson Family). If you choose to 
honor your mother or a female ancestor, list her first name, maiden name and 
married name. 
</P>
<P>
Brochures and registration forms are available from the Statue of Liberty-Ellis 
Island Foundation, Inc., 52 Vanderbilt Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017-3808 or you 
may call (212) 883-1986 and request the information. Deadline for submitting 
your names is Aug. 1. Your contribution will be used to complete the Ellis 
Island restoration and for the creation of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum. 
The restoration of Ellis Island, which began in 1984, will cost $140 million. 
It is the largest restoration project of its kind in American history. 
</P>
<P>
You will receive a certificate, personalized with the name and country of the 
individual you choose to honor. There is a minimum contribution of $100 for 
each name to be registered but there is no limit to the number of names you may 
submit. However, you should list each name and country of origin separately. No 
titles, such as Mrs., Dr. or the Rev. will be used. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Island, located just a few hundred yards from the Statue of Liberty in 
New York harbor, has long been the symbol of the gateway to America. However, 
whether your ancestors entered via this famous landmark or not, the American 
Immigrant Wall of Honor there is an appropriate monument to all of our 
ancestors who came to this country.

For Aiko Yamashita and the many other readers who've been looking for pant

The only local store mentioned was Pic 'N' Save (by Mary Jane Roberts of

These are the mail-order companies, supplied to us by about 30 readers: Harriet 
Carter, Department 19, North Wales, Pa. 19455 ($5.98 a pair); Taylor Gifts, 355 
E. Conestoga Road, P.O. Box 7000, Wayne, Pa. 19093-7000 ($6.98 a pair); Walter 
E. Drake &amp; Sons, 29 Drake Building, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80940 ($8.98 a 
pair); Miles Kimball (they call them "pant creasers"), 41 W. 8th Ave., Oshkosh,

CONSUMER VIEWS: MAIL OFFERS MAY CONFUSE RECIPIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Question: I am enclosing the original of a "document" that I received in my 
rural mailbox recently. I've seen some come-ons in my time, but this bit of 
deception borders on blatant fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Older people receiving something like this might well feel that they would have 
to declare and pay income tax as a result of it. You and I both know that this 
is harmless, but what about the gullible multitudes? I've shown it to several 
friends (elderly) and they were quite put off by it. -- G.A.D. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: What we've got here is an official-looking "window" envelope with a 
couple of grim references to the appropriate "United State Code" penalties 
having to do with the obstruction and/or theft of U.S. mail. But the really 
official look is in the large-type notification on the face of the envelope: 
"Exemplification of Internal Revenue Service Tax Form Enclosed," and, under it, 
"Do Not Miss the 4-7-89 Deadline." 
</P>
<P>
Inside is a replica of IRS Form 1099 ("Miscellaneous Income") with the 
addressee's name and address neatly typed in the proper space and, in Box No. 3 
("Prizes and Awards") the figure $7,500 is also typed. 
</P>
<P>
The enclosed letter contains this sentence: "The IRS requires that major prizes 
and awards be reported on Form 1099. As the recipient of a major item, you must 
report its cash value as miscellaneous income on your U.S. Individual Income 
Tax Return for the year in which you received said sum. We have prepared the 
above example of Form 1099 to illustrate the IRS report." 
</P>
<P>
And, when we flip the page over, what we have is the same old time-share 
come-on: If you make an appointment to visit the time-share development and 
agree to subject yourself to a grueling sales pitch, then you may win a 
valuable prize -- a new Mercedes, or a home computer, or the Island of Guam, or 
seven partridges in a pear tree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Illegal 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately -- tacky, or not -- there's nothing illegal about the practice. 
"Anyone can reproduce any IRS form," a spokesperson for the government agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And, it has to be noted in all fairness, the look-alike Form 1099 does carry 
the notation: "Example only. This form is intended to be used for internal 
processing of major prize winners. Do not file this form with the Internal 
Revenue Service. Upon receipt of any major awards the required tax form shall 
be presented to you." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it a violation of any postal laws, according to Steve Schneringer, the 
Postal Service's Pasadena-based expert on consumer mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's not illegal," he added, "about the only chance we would have 
would be to move against them on a civil basis and try to convince a judge that 
the mailing is misleading." But it's a thin hope, he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The big tip-off in any mailing like this, of course, is to be found in the 
upper right-hand corner of the envelope in which it was mailed: No government 
agency in the country uses a "Bulk Rate" mailing permit. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope that everyone receiving it is as perceptive as your friends were and 
see through it equally clearly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last October, I purchased a diet product called Fitness Images. I faithfully 
used this product and followed their diet to a T. I had not lost any weight, so 
in November, I returned the product. Shortly after that I received a phone call 
from Rickey Effron, the distributor, from whom I had purchased this product. 
She said she was not going to refund my money and was sending the pills back. 
</P>
<P>
I spent $207 on this diet program. She told me that for an additional $50 I 
could buy the "booster" pill, which would make the original pills work better. 
I told her I was not going to give her another dime, and why isn't this booster 
pill sold with the original order? I called the company's Beverly Hills office, 
at Ms. Effron's suggestion, and left a message and so far no one has called me 
back. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot afford to lose $207, nor can I afford another $50 for the booster. Can 
you help? -- A.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: I hate to be a nag, but did you consult your doctor before embarking on this 
diet pill routine? Secondly, there's no pill made that is going to trim off 
excess fat. It's a matter of self-discipline: a medically approved and 
supervised diet and/or a regimen of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diet Supplement 
</P>
<P>
And Rickey Effron, the Encino-based distributor for Fitness Images, concurs 
with this. "It's a diet program built around the pills, which are a diet 
supplement made up of herbs, vitamins, minerals and an appetite suppressant." 
</P>
<P>
Because you returned 2 1/2 cans of pills -- making up a 3-month supply -- 
Effron concludes that you gave up on the program after only two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arises here, Effron feels, "because she obviously wanted a magic, 
and immediate, weight loss. And there's no such thing." 
</P>
<P>
And diet pills, like any other merchandise sold without warranties or 
guarantees, are non-refundable. Write if off to experience and, next time, see 
your doctor first.

SUCCESS STORY AT SYLMAR SCHOOL

<TEXT>
<P>
See what's been going on at Sylmar Elementary School over the last three years, 
and your stereotype of Los Angeles public schools may change. 
</P>
<P>
The school enjoys outside support from a neighborhood business -- Builder's 
Emporium has adopted the school -- and lots of parent involvement, including 
parenting skills sessions offered off-campus, in apartment recreation centers 
and housing projects, where teachers volunteer to teach parents how to help 
their children succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and student volunteers of all ages are building an outdoor science 
center that includes a stream, a sink to demonstrate erosion and a playhouse. 
The $500 for the project was raised through the school's 35-member Parent 
Friendship Group, which meets three days a week to make crafts, cook and sell 
their products to fund special projects such as the science center. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last three years, we have a lot more students coming here from private 
schools," Principal Yvonne Chan said. "The dressing up of our school has a lot 
to do with it. Visitors can see the attractiveness of the physical setting -- 
murals, plants, the childrens' work. Secondly, our reputation has improved due 
to the number of our extra programs and the parent bulletins we distribute."

NEW AND USEFUL: SIMPLE TOOL SHUTS OFF GAS IN A SNAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Emergency Gas Shutoff Tool is so clever, it's hard to imagine no one 
thought of it before. It's a heavy aluminum bar with a slot that fits over the 
gas meter's shut-off valve so you can turn off the gas in a hurry if you need 
to. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 1/2-inch long tool has good leverage for turning, and is stamped with 
the proper position of the valve -- vertical when the gas is on; horizontal 
when off. It also has a small hole on one end, making it easy for you to attach 
it to the meter by a cord. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Gamache, sales representative for the City of Orange tool manufacturer, 
recommends that you show your family how to use the device in case an 
emergency, such as a major earthquake or fire, arises. 
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Gas Shutoff Tool costs $5.99, plus $1.25 for shipping and 
handling. To order -- with a check or money order -- contact National Concepts 
Inc., 1938 N. Batavia, Suite M, Orange, Calif. 92665; phone (714) 921-1674. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miniature Jerseys 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the Garfield cat figures that numerous drivers stick on their car 
windows, Sports Hang-Ups Inc. of Canoga Park, Calif., is now offering baseball 
fans miniature team jerseys that hang from suction cups. 
</P>
<P>
The jerseys, made of cloth and on mini-hangers, are available for all 26 major 
league teams and are licensed by Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, according to the manufacturer, the mini-shirt hang-up line will 
include items for professional football, hockey and basketball teams. The 
football and hockey jerseys will be similar to those for baseball; basketball 
jerseys will be tank tops. In the works, too, are jerseys in school colors for 
college teams, each with a replica of the university's mascot on the front. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail for Sports Hang-Ups is $6.95 and they are available nationwide 
at gift shops, sporting goods stores, carwashes, some airport gift shops and 
some department stores. To locate an outlet, write Sports Hang-Ups Inc., 8245 
Remmet St., Canoga Park, Calif. 91304; phone (818) 713-1092.

<P>
No-Slip Tub Strips 
</P>
<P>
Another California company has just introduced Safe-Tee Strips, a stick-on 
product to keep you from slipping in the bathtub, shower or spa. They're 
transparent and barely visible after installed. 
</P>
<P>
Don Reinke, president of Orbis International, a manufacturer based in Santa 
Paula, says the strips will "become a permanent part of the bathtub or shower 
and will not peel around the edges as so often is the case of popular other 
do-it-yourself non-slip products." They also don't readily build up dirt and 
soap scum. 
</P>
<P>
Safe-Tee Strips should be applied to a clean surface, he explained. They work 
well on porcelain, steel or smooth fiberglass tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Safe-Tee Strips come in two sizes. The tub package includes eight strips, 1x12 
inches, for $9.95; the shower package has 12 squares, 3x3 inches, for $12.95. 
To order write Orbis International, P.O. Box 112, Santa Paula, Calif. 93060; 
phone (805) 933-3507). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Get Organized 
</P>
<P>
If you waste a lot of time looking under the sofa or behind the TV or VCR for 
your remote control units, you might want to try out the Fuzi remote control 
and entertainment guide organizer from US Products in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
It's a small black plastic holder -- 3 1/2 inches high by 5 inches long -- for 
one or two channel changers and a television guide. The remote control units 
attach to each side with Velcro strips, and you can slip an entertainment guide 
in between. There are felt pads for the bottom, so the organizer won't scratch 
surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
The new remote organizer costs $2.99, plus $1.35 for shipping and handling and 
can be ordered from US Products, 121 E. 229th St., Carson, Calif. 90745; phone 
(213) 835-3803. Allow 4 to 6 weeks for delivery. LYNN SIMROSS

<TEXT>
<P>
The "Me Decade" may be synonymous with the 1970s, but "me" is emerging as the 
latest popular theme for private parties, especially birthday bashes. 
</P>
<P>
"We still get calls for the same old themes (Mexican, back to the '50s, 
black-and-white), but I think people are really trying to personalize their 
parties. We've been doing parties recently where the whole theme was about the 
birthday person," said Carolyn Baer, co-owner of Cheers Catering in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The invitations, for example, may feature photos of the celebrant or take the 
form of a Trivial Pursuit card with questions about the person's life. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the props we create to decorate the party are all about the person," Baer 
continued, "such as using life-size photos of the person at different ages. "Or 
maybe we'll put giant versions of the Trivial Pursuit cards all over the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Some birthday boys and girls ask that headlines from the date of their birth be 
used on invitations or decorations. Hit songs from that era -- as well as from 
the person's teen-age years -- may comprise the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Most important: Don't forget to take out the camcorder so there's something to 
show at next year's birthday bash. 
</P>
<P>
Pink and Blue -- and Black 
</P>
<P>
Black is no longer the exclusive fashion province of comedians, working women 
and wanna-be punk rockers. Babies and young girls are donning dark duds, too. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who are prejudiced against black as a color for babies, but 
most people who are trendy seem to like it -- as long as the style isn't 
gloomy. The outfit must have some fun to it," said Abbey Faranesh, owner of 
Animal Kracker/Treehouse in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"The older generation doesn't like black on babies," said Marcie Perrie, a 
salesperson at Splash in Studio City, which even carries black outfits in the 
3-month size. "Sometimes a person isn't sure if the mother of the baby they're 
buying for will like black. Or they're not sure if it's OK for a girl baby. 
They tend to buy more black for boy babies, but it's a good unisex color." 
</P>
<P>
Girls in the 7-to-14 size range are deciding that black is a sophisticated 
color. "When we opened 14 years ago, you never thought of putting black on a 
child," said Alissa Cohen, owner of A La Popcorn in Woodland Hills. "Now black 
is our strongest color, especially with this summer's neon colors as accents." 
</P>
<P>
And what has replaced black as the consumer untouchable? 
</P>
<P>
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Buying Dad's Car 
</P>
<P>
Consider the 1956 Ford Fairlane. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it brings back memories of sticky Sunday afternoon drives or counting 
out-of-state license plates during a trip to grandma's. But if your dad held 
onto the car, it might bring visions of riches to your family. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three years ago, that Fairlane cost $2,459. Today the car -- in average 
condition -- would bring $15,000 to $20,000; the same auto in mint condition 
could bring $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The market for the big-engine cars of the '50s and '60s is crazier than it's 
ever been," said Holden Raphael, president of Spectrum Vehicle Auction in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Many men in their mid-30s are buying the cars from their childhood. "Or they're 
buying the car they craved as a teen-ager, because now they can finally afford 
it," said Raphael, whose company holds classic car auctions throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia, of course, is frequently expensive. 
</P>
<P>
A Chevy Camaro that cost $2,809 in 1967 could go for $30,000 -- if it's in 
flawless condition. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows what price a 1989 Ford Geo will command in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
Native Solutions 
</P>
<P>
Does your yard have a spot that resembles the Bermuda Triangle? A patch where 
every plant gets the life sucked out of it? 
</P>
<P>
You may as well throw your money directly into the ground, thus sparing 
yourself a trip to the nursery and the futile effort of planting, right? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
The Theodore Payne Foundation, a nonprofit nursery in Sun Valley that 
specializes in California native plants, may have a remedy for your black 
thumb. "One of the misconceptions people have about native plants is that 
they're hard to grow," notes Melanie Baer, manager and horticulturist. "But I 
bet about 98% of these plants take." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, many of the California native plants are drought-tolerant. "People 
think of these plants as dry and scrubby," Baer said. "But a lot of them are 
green and lush looking. People who come here are surprised by their beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the plants are now in bloom. Among the roughly 650 varieties for sale 
by the foundation are California lilacs, manzanitas, wild iris, wild geraniums, 
wild hibiscus and wild delphiniums, plus more than 100 plants that are on the 
rare and endangered list. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business has doubled every year for at least the last five years," Baer 
said. "We teach anybody who wants to learn what we know about California native 
plants." 
</P>
<P>
Just think -- if you spruce up the yard, your neighbors might forgive the pink 
flamingos. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard at . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the best things about having a baby is that you get to drive in the 
car-pool lane to get onto the freeway." 
</P>

Nuys.

THE BEAT GOES ON -- IN A FICTIONAL WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, Times Book Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Night Cafe by Joyce Johnson (E. P. Dutton: $17.95. 231 pages) 
</P>
<P>
In a memoir, people and events appear because they were real. In a novel, they 
appear because they have to be real. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Johnson wrote a first-rate memoir several years ago. "Minor Characters" 
told of her young days as a middle-class student from Queens who, for a few 
years, became part -- a small but wonderfully sentient part -- of the Beat 
circle around Jack Kerouac. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Johnson has written a novel with a roughly similar theme. The time is the 
'60s; the narrator is middle-class and from Queens, and has been drifting for a 
few years among artists and musicians. She meets a stormy, mesmerizing painter 
whose uncompromising abstract expressionism is no longer in demand in a market 
that is beginning to go Pop. 
</P>
<P>
They marry and live together with a passion increasingly eroded by his drink 
and despondency. She sees him fading and can do nothing about it, other than 
love him, support him by working, and keeping dinner for him when he staggers 
home late at night. It is not long before he is killed riding his motorcycle, 
an accident with undertones of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
However made-up the story of Joanna and Tom Murphy may be, it inevitably 
suggests a fictionalized memoir. Joanna is a photographer, but she evokes no 
voice or character other than a first-person recollection and lament. Murphy is 
a painter, not a writer, but his moody electricity, his outliving of his vogue, 
his decline and even his looks suggest Kerouac. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, "In the Night Cafe" presents itself as fiction, and as fiction it 
is painfully thin. 
</P>
<P>
Tom gets a brief childhood snippet as the unwanted son of a floozy mother 
married to a bullying second husband. He is given a rich first wife who is 
bitchy and fakey and goes home to Daddy, taking Tom's paintings and their two 
children with her. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, he is the artist, first as demon lover, then as Demon Rum. 
Whatever charm, wit, character or talent he may possess, none of it comes 
across directly. We have to take Joanna's word for it. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna's word, unfortunately, is pretty well worn. Take her account of meeting 
plangent at a party. Tom comes in out of the rain, coatless, wearing a sweater 
and a scarf. He had "a face that had been used a lot, fierce eyes set deep in 
smashed bone." The eyes were blue, as well as fierce. He comes up to Joanna, 
asks "Why do you hang back?" and walks off. 
</P>
<P>
This, she tells us, "suddenly seemed to be the entire painful puzzle of my 
life." She leaves too. "I carried his question into the rain." Later, sitting 
in a cafe, she sees him walk by "very slowly, still with no coat on, holding up 
his face like a blind man daring the rain to fall on him." 
</P>
<P>
Still later, they meet, plangent no longer, at the Cedar Bar. They walk and 
walk. "This is going too fast for you, isn't it?" he asks. "We can't slow it 
down, though." 
</P>
<P>
The lush tone is not kept up, fortunately. Joanna's voice turns stoic, factual, 
even touching. But none of the downs -- there are no real ups -- of what 
follows seems to matter much except to her. Other characters, such as Tom's 
brother, an old painter friend, a young painter disciple, drift in and out to 
little effect. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, not even the protagonists, has any real fictional need to be there. If 
they are there, we feel, it is only because they or their equivalents existed, 
and Johnson wants to tell us about them. 
</P>
<P>
After Tom's death, the book goes to bits and pieces. Joanna drifts over to 
Paris, works as a photographer and meets and marries a French film maker with 
whom she has a son, Nicky. The Frenchman is nice, but doesn't stick around for 
more than a few years. He does provide support, though, and when he invites 
Nicky to visit him in California, he has the imagination to take the boy to the 
movies every night of his five-week stay. Now that, true or not, is a 
fiction-sized event. 
</P>
<P>
So is a late chapter telling of Nicky's extended stay in a hospital, and his 
effort to cope with, and understand, a deranged roommate. Nicky fears the other 
boy, but Joanna's account of his effort to deal with his fear makes a small, 
perfect vignette in a book which, otherwise, is pretty much of a loss.

Trek Talk: Actor-director William Shatner promises that Trekkies devoted to the 
original 1966 "Star Trek" TV series will find plenty to like about "Star Trek 
V: The Final Frontier," scheduled for release June 9. "It harks back to what I 
liked best in the old 'Star Trek' series, and that is the action and the 
adventure and the interplay between the characters," says Shatner, 58, who 
co-wrote the script, directed the film and reprised his role as the intrepid 
James T. Kirk. Shatner says that compared to the other "Star Trek" movies, 
"this picture is rougher and louder and faster -- there's more of an energy 
permeating the film." ALEENE MacMINN

Santa Monica Museum of Art officials Wednesday signed a lease for their Main 
Street building with Edgemar, developers of the multi-use complex that houses 
the museum. They also announced renovation and programming plans. Activities 
scheduled for the museum, slated to open formally in September, include 
exhibits by Alexis Smith and Lita Albuquerque and performances by Rachel 
Rosenthal and Sara Elgart. Formation of the museum has been surrounded by 
controversy. However, all but one of 15 misdemeanor charges against founder 
Abby Sher, filed for her alleged use of the museum before obtaining a final 
certificate of occupancy, have been dropped, said museum director Thomas 
Rhoads. Sher was fined $250 for the outstanding charge.ALEENE MacMINN

"Here she comes . . . Miss U.S.S.R.": Global American Television Inc., an 
independent producer based in Colrain, Mass., has obtained broadcast rights to 
the "Miss U.S.S.R." beauty pageant taking place May 19-21 in Moscow. Global 
spokesman David Nussbaum says the pageant will showcase "extraordinarily 
beautiful and fashionable women," adding: "I think we're ready to discard the 
old images of Russian women as dowdy, industrial, manual-laboring peasants in 
shapeless gray dresses." Terms of the deal with the Soviets were not released, 
and no broadcast dates have been set in this country.ALEENE MacMINN

NBC News President Michael Gartner announced Wednesday that his unit has 
undergone a "major restructuring" aimed at increasing efficiency. Miami bureau 
chief Donald Browne has been named "executive news director," overseeing all 
bureaus, correspondents and producers and coordinating coverage for all NBC 
News programs. Browne will report jointly to Gartner and senior vice presidents 
Joe Angotti in New York and Timothy Russert in Washington. The changes do not 
affect anchor Tom Brokaw, who remains managing editor of "NBC Nightly News." In 
a statement, Gartner said the restructuring was aimed at eliminating 
duplication of effort that will "make life easier for correspondents and 
producers in the field and producers and writers on the programs." Gartner also 
gave "Today" show director George Paul additional duties overseeing the on-air 
look of NBC News programs. Bob Keyes, director of news planning, was named 
director of news operations and will serve as Gartner's special assistant. "NBC 
Nightly News" has been in third place in the news ratings for more than a year, 
and NBC remains the only network with no prime-time news programming, though 
the new "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow" is slated for later this year. ALEENE

MARLBORO MUSICIANS CLOSE LAGUNA CHAMBER SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the evidence of the performance that closed the 29th season of the Laguna 
Beach Chamber Music Society, the emergence onto the professional stage of the 
current Musicians from Marlboro may be a bit premature. 
</P>
<P>
The latest crop of youngsters touring under that name -- all supposedly having 
attended Rudolf Serkin's annual summer Marlboro Festival in Vermont -- again 
ranges from four to nine artists in various combinations. The 1989 tour group 
reached the auditorium at Laguna Beach High School Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The musicians -- who were grouped as a string trio, a string quintet and a 
clarinet quintet -- played unstylish and indeed unfinished performances of 
music by Beethoven, Weber and Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
The playing was characterized by aggressive, harsh and forced attacks, 
recurrent pitch problems and a general lack of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Weber's Quintet in B-flat for clarinet and strings began promisingly, with a 
sensitive halo of string tone from violinists Todd Phillips and Christian 
Tetzlaff, violist Christof Huebner and cellist Peter Wiley. But it was roughly 
interrupted by the loud entrance of clarinetist Daniel McKelway. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter McKelway had problems in control of breath and dynamics, regularly 
overwhelming the strings, losing roundness of tone at extremes and rarely 
tracing expressive or elegant lines. The strings often seemed to inhabit a 
different, more restrained stylistic world. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart's Quintet in G minor arguably was the most successful work on the 
program, with Tetzlaff moving from second into first violin position. 
</P>
<P>
In his new role, Tetzlaff contributed some delicacy of line, warmth and 
lyricism, but the tone often remained thin and edgy. However, the others -- 
Phillips, violist Steven Tenenbom, Huebner and Wiley -- rarely became equal 
partners. There was an overall lack of character, charm or sweetness. Even the 
foreboding opening of the final movement somehow emerged sounding closer in 
style to Pachelbel than to Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
The concert opened with a tense, nervous account of Beethoven's Trio in C 
minor, played without refinement of tone or singing line by Phillips, Tenenbom 
and Wiley. CHRIS PASLES

ANCIENT STRAINS ON TANITA TIKARAM'S HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever intentions Tanita Tikaram might have had in titling her debut album 
"Ancient Heart," the taciturn 19-year-old sensation came off as almost 
shockingly cool, collected, mature and just plain old beyond her years Tuesday 
at the Roxy. 
</P>
<P>
She has a deep voice you'd expect out of someone into middle age, made even 
less girlish Tuesday by the apparent ravages of touring. She has a distanced 
yet not impolite stance you'd expect from someone who's lived a little (or a 
lot). And though Tikaram's themes can be maddeningly vague, it's hard to pick 
out a single lyric cliche in her entire repertoire. Imagine what she'll be like 
at 39. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her somber image, the Englishwoman has rollicking tunes that 
incorporate strains of country and Van Morrison-style Celticisms. And though 
the interesting arrangements on her album (like that attention-getting oboe on 
the hit "Twist in My Sobriety") can be explained away to producers, the best 
moments Tuesday came when the fine band departed and Tikaram stood alone with 
her acoustic guitar, singing very odd songs like "Poor Cow." 
</P>
<P>
The real test with seemingly impenetrable songs like these is whether the 
singer and sound are alluring enough to make a listener want to penetrate them. 
You do, you do. 
</P>
<P>
Tikaram's one flaw in concert, though, was closing her eyes through every song. 
Some performers can convince an audience they're in a trance state, but Tikaram 
seemed to be forcing herself to keep her peepers shut, as if she'd turn into a 
pumpkin if she glimpsed the sold-out crowd. That strain diminished not only her 
performance, but her singular, exotic beauty. Nervous, suppose? Perhaps 
Tikaram's heart is not yet all that ancient after all. CHRIS WILLMAN

ELIAS' PROMISING START TO A PROMISING WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The marvelously talented Brazilian pianist Eliane Elias returned Tuesday night 
for the start of what promises to be a bountiful week of contemporary jazz at 
the Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Her opening set -- despite recurring problems with a sound system that seemed 
determined to eliminate synthesizer keyboardist Rob Harris and bassist Lincoln 
Goines from the band -- bristled with the high energy and passion that are 
intrinsic to Elias' music. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more attractive pieces were "So Far, So Close" (the title track of a 
new album, scheduled for release later this month), a briskly sensuous samba 
titled "At First Sight" and Elias' ever-rocking "Cumpari &amp; Soul." 
</P>
<P>
A high point of the set was a totally unplanned solo excursion through "All the 
Things You Are" that clearly identified Elias as an improviser with virtually 
unlimited horizons. Mixing long, arching lines with lush harmonic clusters, 
shifting into a slow, rhythmic left hand to support a stream of wildly soaring 
notes from her right hand, Elias managed to incorporate a good chunk of jazz 
piano history in one brief improvisation. It was a moment to remember. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, one disturbing thing about the Elias performance. Drummer 
Vinnie Colaiuta -- gifted though he may be as a fusion performer -- was both 
out of control and overbearingly loud. His usually crisp drum sound was harsh 
and rattling, and he persistently obscured the subtleties of the music with a 
storm cloud of shakes, rattles and rolls. Colaiuta is too good a player, and 
Elias' pieces are too deserving of better treatment, for such an approach to 
continue. One hopes it changes before the close of an otherwise 
state-of-the-art week of contemporary jazz. DON HECKMAN

AMERICA'S PROBLEM: NON-THINKING STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "America's Kids: Teaching Them to Think," airing at 10 tonight on Channels 
7, 3, 10 and 42, host Barbara Walters promises to take viewers "on a search for 
solutions to one of the most pressing problems in American education." 
</P>
<P>
To some extent -- marred by a few weak segments -- "America's Kids" succeeds in 
the search. 
</P>
<P>
The show is a follow-up to an earlier ABC documentary titled "America's Kids: 
Why Do They Flunk?" That program showed students' horrifying lack of general 
knowledge; "Teaching" argues that children are inadequately prepared to think 
and reason on their own. 
</P>
<P>
While making their case about the need to stimulate the development of critical 
thinking skills at all age and grade levels, director Roger Goodman and Walters 
all too often reach for the simple statement followed by an equally simple, 
quick sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
An example: Reporter Greg Dobbs says "And even our first-rate national defense 
is at stake; new recruits have to tackle technology in almost every military 
job." Jump to a sound bite of Adm. William Crowe saying, "We demand thinking 
people today throughout the force. I am not confident that our educational 
system . . . is going to meet that challenge. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
End it, move to another 30-second segment. Back to you, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"America's Kids" does much better delineating three major problems -- labeling 
of students as "slow," rote learning and poor home influences -- that affect 
children's education right from the start, showing how these stunt the 
development of thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "America's Kids" gets to the meat of the show, the promised solutions, 
hopscotching across the nation to examine successful school programs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the good programs that can easily be put in place without spending more 
money are cooperative learning, where students in small groups team up to help 
each other; having children write and edit their own stories, and contracts 
between parents and children spelling out what each must do to promote learning 
</P>
<P>
Other ideas covered: Santa Monica's attempt to phase out the "tracking" of 
groups of students; offering "opportunity" classes for small groups of students 
who study different subjects with the same teachers up to four hours a day, and 
a Rochester, N.Y., high school that concentrates on giving students the 
attention and guidance they may not receive at home, with teachers acting as 
personal counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, "America's Kids" is worthwhile -- at least as a starting point for 
examining solutions to our nation's education problems. It's too bad the 
producers didn't think a little harder about how to better use their air time 
-- by concentrating even more on the solutions.

 HINTS FROM HELOISE: BEST WAY TO AVOID FREEZER BURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have had to throw away a whole lot of beef, chicken and pork 
pieces because of freezer burn. There is only my husband and me (we're 
newlyweds) so I buy meat in bulk, on sale, and freeze it in two serving 
portions. 
</P>
<P>
I wrapped the meat in aluminum foil but found holes in the packages I had to 
throw away. Evidently a pin hole was enough to cause freezer burn. 
</P>
<P>
My sister uses plastic and claims she never has this problem, but I would think 
even plastic can get holes. Is freezer wrap the only thing that is safe for 
wrapping meat that is to be frozen? 
</P>
<P>
 -- READER, Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: If meat is not wrapped correctly before freezing, it will become 
freezer-burned. When the meat is exposed through a tear or hole in the 
wrapping, it will discolor, losing its flavor and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent this, always use paper or plastic that is manufactured for wrapping 
food to be frozen. Remove as much air as possible from the bag or seal the 
paper well. 
</P>
<P>
Never freeze meat in the store package. This wrapping is not airtight or 
moisture-proof, and the meat will become freezer-burned rather quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Don't throw away your hard-earned money by having to throw out ruined meat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Each time I grocery-shop I find myself in a long line at the 
checkout stand with some of the shoppers complaining that there is not enough 
space between the check stands and the grocery aisles for them to get around 
the lines. 
</P>
<P>
I have observed that most shoppers stand behind the shopping cart while waiting 
in the checkout line. How simple it would be if each shopper stood on the right 
side of the shopping cart while in line to check out so the carts could be 
closer together, thereby shortening the line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- F.M., Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have a double kitchen sink with a very small counter work 
space. I keep a dish drainer in one side of the sink, and to increase counter 
space I turn the dish drainer upside down and put my chopping board on top of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
It provides a great place to chop vegetables and fruit with ever so easy a 
cleanup -- just turn on the faucet and send the peelings down the disposal. In 
my book, this beats cleaning up a messy counter any time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BARBARA, Upper Sandusky, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I cover some food dishes with plastic wrap and cook them in the 
microwave. More often than not, I end up burning myself from the steam that 
escapes when I lift the plastic from the dish after cooking. Do you know of a 
remedy? 
</P>
<P>
 -- DOROTHY 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DOROTHY: When placing plastic wrap on a dish that will be cooked in a 
microwave, lift back one corner of the plastic wrap slightly to make a vent, to 
let the steam escape during the cooking process if the recipe allows it. Also, 
a good rule of thumb to remember is to let it sit for a few minutes after 
removing from the microwave.

 ABOUT WINE: PONDERING THE UNCERTAIN FATE OF PATRICIAN VINTAGES IN A 6-PACK 
SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ROSA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wines that are either extremely tart or light, crisp and delicate are often 
misunderstood by consumers, and this causes consternation for some wine makers. 
</P>
<P>
Wine makers sadly tell stories of wines they've made that have not been big, 
rich, oaky monsters, but rather have shown a degree of elegance. They say that 
some wine reviewers denigrate their lighter-styled wines because they prefer 
the chewy, oaky, flabby style of wine. 
</P>
<P>
And such is the impact of some writers that many consumers buy the bigger wines 
eagerly, bypassing the wines of finesse. This encourages wine makers to make 
more wines that are bigger, fleshier, more obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Yet wines that are loaded with wood flavors and high alcohol rarely age as well 
as wines that are in better balance when young, a fact born out by a taste of 
an older Chardonnay from Stony Hill. These hard-to-find wines are usually lean 
when they are young and appear simplistic, but they develop charms with many 
years in the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patience Is a Virtue 
</P>
<P>
With wine, patience is a virtue, but in today's "I want it now" society, few 
people are willing to wait for the charms of maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Tasting about 100 1987 California Chardonnays in the last few weeks, I was 
struck by the fact that many California wine makers are trying hard to make 
wines of better balance and harmony, but a number of wineries are still under 
the misbelief that bigger is better. 
</P>
<P>
Still, those in the finesse game often have a rude awakening. 
</P>
<P>
Merry Edwards has as good an understanding of Chardonnay as anyone in the 
business, yet just four years ago made a decision that was off the mark as far 
as the public was concerned. And it irritates her. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is wine maker at The Merry Vintners, a one-woman operation sitting on a 
flat plateau above the Russian River plain. All she makes is Chardonnay, a 
project that followed stints as wine maker at Mount Eden Vineyards in Saratoga 
and Matanzas Creek Winery in Sonoma County, where her Chardonnays won wide 
acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All-New Oak Barrels 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is a classicist. Her Mount Eden Chardonnays were made from fully ripe 
fruit; the juice was fermented in all-new oak barrels and the resulting wine 
was rich and unctuous, but with long life in the bottle. (I recently tasted the 
1978 Mount Eden Chardonnay and it was still magnificent.) 
</P>
<P>
Later, at Matanzas Creek, her early 1980s wines won awards and today remain 
exceptionally well balanced. Starting with 1984 her own Merry Vintners' 
Chardonnays have shown potential to expand in the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, she made a Merry Vintners Chardonnay that was a perfect example of her 
style. The wine had deep peach-like fruit character and oak tones and plenty of 
acidity to permit it to age. I loved it. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't sell. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a different era today," said Merry the other day. "This is a 'now' 
society, and everyone wants a wine to drink tonight. No one puts wine away in 
the cellar any more. But when I was at Mount Eden, people bought a case and put 
it in the cellar to age." 
</P>
<P>
She loved her 1985, but noted that it didn't capture the public's fancy because 
the high acidity made the wine initially very tart. Since people are not into 
aging such wines any more, few understood its potential. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close-Out Table Bargain 
</P>
<P>
Walking through a grocery store just a few miles from the winery recently, I 
spied the 1985 Merry Vintners Chardonnay on the close-out table. It was 
originally supposed to sell for $14. It was marked $8.99. I bought three 
bottles and tried one. 
</P>
<P>
The wine was better for the extra 18 months it's had in the bottle since I last 
tasted it. It was rounder, richer, still in balance . . . and still loaded with 
acidity. No doubt about it, the wine was tart. But when served with food, it 
was exceptional, complementing the meal beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when it was released the response by the now generation of wine 
consumers was: too tart. Give us something more approachable, they said. 
</P>
<P>
So Merry has. Yet she hasn't compromised. The soon to be released 1987 Merry 
Vintners Chardonnay Reserve ($17) is a magnificent example of a broad, rich yet 
balanced wine with a hint of spice, a layer of pineapple fruit, and a full, 
complete taste. This time, however, the acid is not dominant, but still ample 
enough to allow the wine to age. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giving In to Temptation 
</P>
<P>
Edwards admits she could have made the 1987 Chardonnay broader, fatter, more 
oaky, but that would have showed no restraint. It would be giving in to 
temptation to pander to the now people. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Booth at Conn Creek in the Napa Valley also believes in the reined-in 
style of wine making for Chardonnay. His 1986 Chardonnay ($13) went through a 
single fermentation in oak and then was bottled without much additional 
tweaking of the wine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to let the fruit be the dominant characteristic," said 
Booth, whose lovely Chardonnay accents a delicate citrusy tone with muted oak 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
Booth's mentor at Conn Creek is Andre Tchelistcheff, California's greatest wine 
maker who, at age 88 is back at work full-time for the first time in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tchelistcheff, who was hired as chief enologist for Beaulieu Vineyard in 1938, 
has been a consultant to dozens of wineries since 1972 when he left BV. Among 
the places he's worked at part time is Chateau Ste. Michelle in Washington 
State. When Ste. Michelle's parent, U.S. Tobacco Co., bought Conn Creek, it 
asked Tchelistcheff to revamp its fortunes, so Andre went back to full-time 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the tremendous pleasure of being an old man in an industry of young 
people and seeing the concentration and dedication of a young man like Jeff -- 
and in seeing his restraint," said Tchelistcheff as we tasted the '86 Conn 
Creek Chardonnay. He said he preferred this style, as opposed to the richer, 
more unctuous style of Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interprets With Finesse 
</P>
<P>
Julia Iantosca, wine maker at William Wheeler Winery in Sonoma County, likewise 
looks for grapes that make a veiled wine and she interprets them with finesse. 
</P>
<P>
"With our Chardonnay, we're aiming for a more delicate style," said Iantosca. 
"We're looking for leaner body. The bigger wines can have an interesting 
flavor, but they don't have the flavor profile that we like, with high 
acidity." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler's 1987 Chardonnay ($12) is a grand example of the type, with nuances 
that simply can't be seen if the wine is chilled down too much (a common error 
in restaurants). Serve this type of wine closer to 60 degrees, not 40. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, if this wine is in a blind tasting with bigger wines, sometimes our 
style can be overlooked," she said, noting that wines with more oak or alcohol 
often score better with wine judges. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler buys Chardonnay grapes from six different Sonoma County vineyards, 
focusing on those in the cooler regions of Russian River and the Carneros 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Then the wine is aged in oak for an average of 4 1/2 months and the result is a 
crisp, fragrant wine. 
</P>
<P>
High acidity and delicate flavors may not be in vogue with those wine lovers 
who want huge, oaky, impressive wines, but this lighter style is appreciated by 
a number of purist wine makers. It's this variety of style that makes the world 
of wine so intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Dry Creek Chenin Blanc ($6.50) -- A thoroughly appealing 
wine of spice and charm. It has a trace of residual sugar (.4%) and a tropical 
fruit aroma and is an excellent match for many seafood dishes.

WINE NOTES: SHOWBIZ LIKES THEM BEST: SMOTHER BROS. 'SCALE BACK' VINTNER CAREERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The recent resurgence of interest in the Smothers Brothers as a comedy/folk 
act, both on television and on stage, has been good for the fortunes of Tom and 
Dick, but not for those who like their wines. 
</P>
<P>
CBS brought the brothers back for a decades-later reprise of their comedy show 
last year. Then the brothers found that there was demand for their talents in 
places like Las Vegas too. And that meant that making and marketing their 
Smothers wines had to take a back seat. 
</P>
<P>
So they decided to get out of the commercial wine business. 
</P>
<P>
"When their entertainment career took off again, they didn't have time to do 
both," said Jack Daniels of Wilson-Daniels Ltd., the Napa Valley-based wine 
company that was the national representative for the Smothers wines. "So they 
decided to scale back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The End of the Line 
</P>
<P>
The wines have begun to be closed out at lower prices than they previously 
fetched, Daniels said. When the current supply is gone, no more will be made 
for commercial sale. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers first got into the wine business in the mid-1970s when Dick 
Smothers bought the Vine Hill Ranch, a 12-acre vineyard in the Santa Cruz 
Mountains, and shortly after began producing wine. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Tom Smothers acquired the 60-acre Remmick Ridge Vineyard in Kenwood, in 
the Sonoma Valley. A Smothers tasting room was set up on Highway 12, not far 
from such well-regarded wineries as Grand Cru, Kenwood and Chateau St. Jean. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers' first major wine coup came in 1979 when their 1977 Gewurztraminer 
won the sweepstakes award at the Los Angeles County Fair wine competition. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the Smothers brand was producing 40,000 cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said a small amount of Smothers wine, perhaps as much as 1,000 cases a 
year, would continue to be made off the Remmick vineyard, which has only 
Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc planted. All such wine will be sold only at the 
tasting room. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Smothers sold his Vine Hill property not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Tom carries a business card that says, "Tom Smothers, Farmer." 
</P>
<P>
They staged a dinner the other evening to mark the release of a new wine from 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The vintage is 1952. 
</P>
<P>
It might seem a bit unusual to be offering the initial release of a wine made 
37 years ago, but the house of Marques de Murrieta is not your typical wine 
producer. This Rioja property founded in 1870 uses old traditional methods of 
producing wine, and the best red wine of the house is aged in bottle at the 
property until it is ready to be consumed. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the 1952 Castillo Ygay from Marques de Murrieta will be 
released in a few weeks. It is a magnificent example of wine aged long in the 
barrel and very long in the bottle. Yet the wine retains good deep red color 
and fruit and has ample richness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Fine Wine Takes Time 
</P>
<P>
The present owner of the property, Vicente Cebrian Sagarriga, El Conde (Count) 
de Creixell, noted that these wines remain in oak barrels for more than three 
years. One would think with that much wood exposure the wine would be oxidized, 
but Darrell Corti, the Sacramento wine merchant who has studied these wines as 
well as anyone, gave an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"In Rioja, they don't use oak the way we use oak," said Corti. He pointed out 
that as red wine ages, it drops tartrate crystals out of solution, which 
accumulate on the inside of the barrel. In most wine-making countries, tartrate 
crystals are removed from the oak casks. At Marques de Murrieta, they are not, 
and thus the tartrates coat the interior of each barrel with a tasteless and 
odorless crystal. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, these wines have been in glass containers all their lives," said 
Corti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Price Posted 
</P>
<P>
The 1942 Castillo Ygay, released some years ago, remains available in the 
commercial market. It sells for $150 a bottle. No price has yet been posted for 
the '52, but it likely will be sold for about the same price. For those whose 
birth years are 1942 or 1952, these wines are a rare opportunity to see what 
aging can do to a great wine. 
</P>
<P>
And for those who have just turned 21 and would like some wine from his or her 
birth year, the 1968 Castillo Ygay is still available at $44. It's lighter and 
more delicate than the previous wines, but equally enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
For a glimpse of what the Murrieta property does with its regular wines, the 
1983 Marques de Murrieta Blanca (white) and 1983 Tinto, at $13 each, are good 
examples of well-made wines. 
</P>
<P>
A new line of wines under the Blossom Hill label has been released by Heublein 
Wines, the division of Grand Metropolitan PLC of England that also markets 
wines under the Almaden and Charles Lefranc labels, among other wines. 
</P>
<P>
The Blossom Hill line is in a niche in the market called Affordable Varietals, 
wines in 1.5-liter bottles priced to sell for $6.50 to $7. 
</P>
<P>
With the move of Almaden Vineyards from San Jose to Madera (to consolidate 
operations), the Almaden line of wines has been repositioned to generic wine. 
The Charles Lefranc line is now all the so-called Pop-Premium wines, 
cork-finished bottles of 750 milliliters selling for $5 or thereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
Heublein also is the parent company of Beaulieu Vineyard and Inglenook in the 
Napa Valley, and markets the Navalle Selections and wines under the Rutherford 
Estate name (formerly the vintage line of Inglenook). The Rutherford Estate 
line is priced above Pop-Premium at about $6.50 per 750-milliliter bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The best wine in the Blossom Hill line is the 1986 Cabernet Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Blossom Hill is the name of the street in San Jose on which 
Almaden's former winery was located. 
</P>
<P>
Gauer Ranch, now owned by a subsidiary of Chevron, has released its first wine, 
the 1987 Gauer Estate Chardonnay ($16). 
</P>
<P>
Wine maker Kerry Damskey's first effort with the grapes from the Gauer Ranch in 
Alexander Valley is a fairly rich, broad, lightly spicy wine with deep flavors 
and richness. It matches well with food prepared with cream sauces. 
</P>
<P>
Frontier West Properties, a San Francisco real estate investment company owned 
by Hideaki Ando, has bought the Harvest Inn, a major hotel in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ando, a Japanese citizen, acquired the Whitehall Lane Winery in the Napa Valley 
last December.

THE BUTCHER: NO NEED TO WASH MEATS FRESH FROM THE LOCAL STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the many letters we've received from readers is one that reads: "I wash 
everything my family and I eat, including meat, and I have been chided on this 
by friends and family as being finicky. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not like the bone chips that come from the sawing of meat and that is 
just one of the reasons I wash it. I am also concerned about additives used to 
retain color and retard spoilage. Am I being too finicky? Am I losing some 
valuable nutrition? Does this harm the meat in any other way?" 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of poultry, there is no need to wash fresh meat. Doing so 
does indeed cause the loss of water-soluble nutrients. To remove bone dust -- 
which should have been removed by the butcher -- it is better to scrape the 
meat with the back of a knife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Substance Abuse 
</P>
<P>
With regard to the use of "additives to retain color and retard spoilage," I 
seriously doubt that any butcher uses any such substances. We have very good 
labeling laws in this country, and I feel quite safe in saying that no butcher 
in his right mind would risk the results of being caught. 
</P>
<P>
A reader from Virginia writes: "When we were in Texas recently, we bought some 
arm steaks. We have never heard of that cut before. It was good, all of those 
who tasted it agreed, and we wondered why we had never heard of arm steaks 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Butchers in various parts of the country cut meat differently. Traditionally, 
in the eastern part of America, beef was cut with the bone left in. One of the 
cuts that resulted from cutting the shoulder or chuck section of the beef 
carcass with the bone in was the arm chuck pot roast -- a large cross-section 
of the shoulder where the front leg was attached. Because it contained several 
different muscles, some quite tough, the recommended cooking method was moist 
heat, i.e., pot roasting. 
</P>
<P>
In the western part of the United States, beef has almost always been 
muscle-boned; that is, each individual muscle removed from the carcass is sold 
separately as a roast, steak, stew, etc., depending on its degree of 
tenderness. The arm steak that you had in Texas was very likely cut from what 
is called the shoulder clod, which is the most tender muscle from the arm 
chuck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Nomenclature Chart 
</P>
<P>
Yet another reader offers a suggestion that may help. "Of particular interest 
would be the descriptive nomenclature of various cuts of beef, veal, pork and 
lamb. Recipes are boundless, but most cookbooks don't do a very good job in 
this area, especially with all the various regional names. A composite chart 
identifying the animal, describing the cut and location, listing regional or 
other names and common methods of preparation (broil, grill, etc.) would be 
ideal. Does such a thing exist and if so, how can I get one?" 
</P>
<P>
The National Livestock and Meat Board used to have charts available for beef, 
lamb, pork and veal that were very helpful in showing where the various cuts 
came from on the carcass, which were tough, which were tender and so on. 
</P>
<P>
A reader in San Gabriel writes: "OK, you've answered the question of how fresh 
is fresh chicken. Now, please answer this, why do I see so many packages of 
fish and 'fresh' pork cuts labeled 'thawed; previously frozen'? Why in heaven's 
name don't they leave them frozen? When these packages are thawed, they get 
messy looking, all watery and leave me wondering if it is OK to freeze that 
item until I'm ready to use it." 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons why markets thaw meat and fish that has been frozen. 
In my opinion there are no good reasons for doing so; no reasons that make any 
sense, but there are reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Popular Perception 
</P>
<P>
Most people perceive frozen as not fresh and will pass up fish in the frozen 
food case in favor of thawed, previously frozen fish in the fresh fish counter. 
It doesn't make any sense to me, but that's the way it is. People tend not to 
buy frozen fish and meat when the unfrozen counterpart is available. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason, I think, is that people don't realize that you can start the 
cooking process from the frozen state. Most people shop one meal at a time and 
they think if they buy something frozen, it's going to need thawing before they 
can cook it. Few realize that meat and fish can go directly from the freezer to 
the skillet or oven without being thawed. 
</P>
<P>
When the word gets out, you'll likely see much more meat and fish sold frozen 
solid. It's often fresher that way.

 BACK TO BASICS: THE HOW-TO'S OF MEASURING RECIPE INGREDIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When using dry measuring cups, it's important to select the size cup (or in the 
case of 2/3 cup or 3/4 cup, two cups must often be used) with the exact 
capacity called for in the recipe. Then fill the cup even with the top rim. 
</P>
<P>
Dry ingredients such as flour, grains, crumbs and granulated sugar should be 
stirred before measuring, then lightly spooned into the cup until it overflows. 
Do not tap the cup and pack the ingredient down. Level the ingredient with the 
rim using a metal spatula or straight-sided knife. 
</P>
<P>
It was necessary in the past to sift flour to remove lumps, but today, unless 
the recipe directs, flour no longer needs to be sifted before measuring. Most 
sources, however, recommend sifting powdered sugar to achieve the most accurate 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to brown sugar, it should be packed firmly into the cup with a 
spoon so lumps are crushed and it retains the shape of the cup when removed. 
Shortening, butter and other dense ingredients also need to be packed into the 
cup to remove any air space. Use a rubber spatula to pack and level off these 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Chopped, sliced and shredded foods are measured by lightly placing them in the 
cup until even with rim. Do not pack these ingredients unless instructed to do 
so in the recipe.

LOOK TO THE FABULOUS FLAVORS AND LOW-CALORIE COUNTS OF SORBETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA STURGIS, Sturgis is test kitchen director for Food &amp; Wine 
Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're all children when it comes to ices, and sorbets are the ices of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
A sorbet is simply a sweetened liquid, often a fruit juice or puree, which is 
frozen and then stirred or, better yet, churned to break up the ice crystals. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the calories and dairy content of ice creams or milk sherbets, these 
coolers still manage to pull off the big trick -- fabulous flavors, great 
textures and good looks. 
</P>
<P>
Warm weather season is no time to be fiddling around with fussy desserts, and 
these mouth-watering treats are easily and quickly prepared in any ice cream 
machine. Look for luscious peaches or ripe berries for the fruit sorbets, as 
simple recipes rely on using top-quality produce for flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Sorbets may be served right from the machine or prepared ahead and frozen. To 
prevent a quick thaw, just remember to have chilled glasses or a container 
ready in the freezer. The frozen treats are all simple to prepare, and the 
following techniques should help you churn batches of perfect sorbets 
throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pureed fruits are generally too pulpy to dissolve sugar and are usually 
sweetened by the addition of a sugar syrup (sugar dissolved in water). 
</P>
<P>
 -- For all sorbets, adjust the sugar to taste, adding a little more than seems 
necessary, as food tastes less sweet when frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The addition of a small amount of alcohol (usually wine or liqueur), which 
cannot freeze solid, will prevent a sorbet from becoming too hard if frozen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For citrus sorbets, pulverizing the zest of the fruit with the sugar is a 
great way to extract flavor from the skin.

LONG BEACH OKS PLANS FOR 16-DEALER $57-MILLION AUTO MALL NEAR FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1 1/2 years after a task force recommended that the city develop an 
auto mall to bolster its sales tax income, the City Council has approved a plan 
to build a 16-dealer mall just south of the 405 Freeway between Orange and 
California avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach thus joins a host of other Southern California communities that have 
created auto malls in the hope of laying a golden egg. Just next door to the 
Long Beach mall will be a smaller one planned by the city of Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Redevelopment Agency officials estimate it will cost the agency $57 
million to buy the land and develop the site, which consists of nearly 90 acres 
of old oil fields and industrial buildings. For the first decade, sales tax 
income from the mall, an estimated $3.5 million to $5 million a year, will go 
to the agency to help finance the project. But by the year 2000, the tax money 
should start flowing into the city's General Fund, according to Community 
Development Director Susan F. Shick. 
</P>
<P>
For years, city car sales have been concentrated on "Auto Row" on Long Beach 
Boulevard, where dealers clustered long before the concept of carefully planned 
malls transformed the world of automobile transactions. But the general decline 
of surrounding neighborhoods, lack of space for expansion and construction of 
the light rail transit system down the middle of Long Beach Boulevard have all 
made the boulevard less attractive to dealers and car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The city's sales tax income from car sales has been slipping and officials fear 
dealers will leave for other communities if Long Beach does not build its own 
auto mall where customers can stroll from one landscaped car lot to another. 
</P>
<P>
Under the redevelopment plan approved this week by the council, the 
Redevelopment Agency will buy the acreage from about 30 property owners, clear 
the area, clean up oil-contaminated soil and sell the land to dealers, who will 
pay for only a portion of the total mall costs. More than half the money to 
develop the project will come from a $31-million agency bond. 
</P>
<P>
Signal Hill is further along in developing its 18-acre, three-dealer auto mall, 
the first part of which will probably open in 1990, according to Signal Hill's 
redevelopment director. Shick predicted the first dealers would open in Long 
Beach within two years.

GAY COMMUNITY RALLIES TO SUPPORT ACCUSED THERAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday was Judith M. Doyle Night at a Long Beach bar called Details. 
</P>
<P>
Holding court amid rounds of hugs, Doyle -- a well-known activist in this 
city's gay and lesbian community -- shook hands and chatted while more than 150 
of her friends and supporters danced, drank and made pilgrimages with their 
checkbooks to a special legal defense table set up in a corner of the 
establishment on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"A member of our community is being attacked," said Michael Miner, former board 
chairman of One in Long Beach Inc., the city's major social service agency for 
homosexuals. Doyle is executive director of the agency. "The issue isn't 
whether the allegations are true or false, but that one of our own is in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Grateful for Friends' 
</P>
<P>
Said Doyle: "I'm just overwhelmed. I'm so grateful for my friends." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is an allegation that Doyle, a family therapist, became involved in a 
sexual relationship with a former client. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle has admitted the sexual relationship, but testified during an 
administrative hearing on the matter that it did not begin until after the 
therapeutic relationship had ended. At stake is Doyle's state license to 
practice family therapy and possibly her effectiveness as a community leader. 
</P>
<P>
Besides heading One in Long Beach Inc., Doyle is a founder of the city's annual 
gay pride festival and was chairwoman of last month's successful AIDS Walk/Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't think it will hamper her effectiveness at all," said Geoff 
McIntosh, current chairman of the One in Long Beach board, which recently gave 
Doyle a formal vote of confidence. "I think the community has maintained a 
position that (one is) innocent until proven guilty. I feel strongly that she's 
been a great asset. She's a wonderful leader and a great inspiration, and I 
feel nothing but admiration and support for Judy." 
</P>
<P>
The allegation against Doyle is being considered in a hearing before Los 
Angeles Administrative Law Judge Rosalyn M. Chapman, which opened earlier this 
month and after seven days, was continued to September. In addition to 
engendering intense interest among the city's large homosexual population, the 
case has raised questions about the ethics of the therapist-client 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Licensed Since 1977 
</P>
<P>
The case has its roots in 1982 when Patricia A. Lamis, then an interior 
designer, sought Doyle's services as a therapist. Doyle, who has been licensed 
by the state to practice family therapy since 1977, runs a private counseling 
service that includes many homosexual clients. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of a year, both Doyle and Lamis testified, they met in nine 
formal paid counseling sessions during which they discussed issues ranging from 
Lamis' failing relationship with another woman to various stresses at her job. 
</P>
<P>
That is when the two accounts begin to diverge. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle testified that about four months after formally ending the counseling 
sessions in April, 1983, Lamis initiated a sexual relationship that lasted 
through the end of the year. Mindful of the potential damage inherent in such a 
relationship, Doyle testified, she made a careful professional assessment of 
her former client's state of mind to assure herself that Lamis no longer 
considered their relationship therapeutic. Among other things, she said, she 
observed Lamis' behavior toward her and discussed with her the fact that any 
romantic involvement between the two would preclude future therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Lamis, on the other hand, testified that she always considered Doyle her 
therapist, even after their formal therapy sessions had ended. And in a civil 
suit filed in 1986, as well as in a complaint to the state Board of Behavioral 
Science Examiners, which licenses family therapists, she said that her sexual 
involvement with Doyle caused great emotional pain and confusion which, among 
other things, made it impossible for her to continue her career and contributed 
to her current unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to both sides, Judge Chapman will have at least 30 days to 
issue an opinion on whether Doyle's license should be revoked by the board. The 
civil suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Disagreement on Ban 
</P>
<P>
Although experts say that most family therapists believe it is unethical to 
engage in sexual relations with clients during the period in which the clients 
are undergoing therapy, there is some disagreement over the extent to which 
that ban should apply to former clients. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Mary Riemersma, executive director of the 14,000-member 
California Assn. of Marriage and Family Therapists, said that in the early 
1980s, when Doyle and Lamis were dating, the profession's ethical guidelines 
were silent on the question of just when a therapeutic relationship ends. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Riemersma said, legislators enacted a law that defines the length 
of the therapeutic relationship as two years after the termination of formal 
sessions. And now, she said, her association is sponsoring legislation that 
would make it a criminal offense for a therapist to have sex with a client up 
to six months after formal therapy ends. 
</P>
<P>
"It is something we are very concerned about," Riemersma said. "It is a 
significant problem." 
</P>
<P>
So significant, according to officials of the state Board of Behavioral Science 
Examiners, that the number of pending cases involving alleged sexual misconduct 
by California therapists has risen from about five in 1984 to about 100 today. 
While the vast majority involve male therapists accused of becoming sexually 
involved with female clients, said Kathleen Callanan, the board's executive 
officer, a smattering of others have involved homosexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Issues 
</P>
<P>
It was Callanan who filed the board's formal accusation against Doyle based on 
Lamis' complaint. In recommending a resolution, lawyers on both sides say, 
Judge Chapman will be asked to consider several issues, including whether the 
therapeutic relationship was actually terminated before the sexual relationship 
began, whether a reasonable length of time elapsed between termination of the 
formal sessions and commencement of the personal relationship and whether Doyle 
made reasonable efforts to determine that the sexual relationship would not 
harm her former client. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the city's homosexual community fear that the case could lead 
to negative feelings towards homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people are unhappy with the publicity," said David Newell, 
president of the city's Lambda Democratic Club, a homosexually oriented 
political group. "Whenever any kind of accusation of lurid conduct comes out 
against anybody in a minority community, obviously it is going to reflect badly 
on that community." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, though, the public reaction has been characterized by the 
kind of support evident at this week's disco gathering, where friends who 
organized the event said they collected about $4,000 in donations to help 
defray Doyle's legal expenses, which have already amounted to more than 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Willing to Speak Out' 
</P>
<P>
"She is an extremely important member of the community who is willing to speak 
out for the community," said JoEllen Craglione, a resident of Orange who 
performed with a group of clog dancers at the fund-raising event. "I hope she 
sees the support that she has." 
</P>
<P>
Said Paul F. Cole, a friend who also happens to be a licensed clinical social 
worker: "What happened to Judy could happen to any of us. I really love her and 
I'm sure she never intended to hurt anybody. She is a wonderful example of 
someone who has given her heart and soul to the gay community; she's one of our 
best." 
</P>
<P>
Although Doyle's position as the executive director of One in Long Beach Inc., 
is in no immediate jeopardy, board chairman McIntosh said, the board could be 
forced to reassess its position should she lose her case. "We wouldn't 
specifically remove her for being guilty," he said, "although we would no doubt 
have to reflect on how it would affect our ability to obtain grants." 
</P>
<P>
Doyle says it is too early to tell yet whether her private practice will suffer 
as a result of the controversy, even if she retains her license. And although 
she was back on the job at One in Long Beach Inc. this week, she said the 
emotional strain has been great. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an incredulous experience," Doyle said in an interview during a break at 
last week's hearing. "It's antithetical to everything I stand for. I'm just 
amazed."

MOORPARK, OXNARD COLLEGES END SEARCH FOR PRESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ventura County Community College District's governing board this week 
selected presidents for two of the district's three colleges. Both jobs had 
been unfilled for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
After a nationwide search, the board Tuesday night named Stanley L. Bowers, 
acting president of Moorpark College, as the new president, and Elise D. 
Schneider, vice president of instruction at Merced College, as president of 
Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers was approved after review of 55 other candidates. He has been with the 
district since 1975. In 1983, he was named vice president of administrative 
services at Moorpark. He was named acting president of the college in June, 
replacing Dr. W. Ray Hearon, who has been on sabbatical leave the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Hearon has been named the district's executive vice chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider will become the district's first female president. Selected from 71 
applicants, she replaces Ed Robings, who resigned from Oxnard College in July. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Tom Ely said the screening committee, which was composed of 
faculty, management, staff and community members, narrowed the field of 
candidates, with the board making the final selection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with the blend of an outside person, plus an insider. An outside 
person can bring new, fresh ideas to the district, while someone who has been 
with the district and has moved up will create an open position and an 
opportunity for upward mobility in the staff," Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, who has worked with Bowers as a member of the Moorpark College Foundation, 
said Bowers "would provide a continuity. I don't think people know that 
academically he holds a full professorship. He is well published and is well 
considered in the community. He has a tremendous record." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lloyd, acting vice president for administrative services at Moorpark 
College, said Bowers' appointment as president is "a very just reward. He's one 
of the most popular persons on campus, very personable, very present. His 
selection was very important to the people here." 
</P>
<P>
Bowers is a director on the board of Los Robles Regional Medical Center and a 
director and officer of the Moorpark Boys and Girls Club. He received his 
master's degree in education at Johns Hopkins University in 1959 and his Ed.D. 
degree in higher education in 1974 from USC. He is a part-time instructor for 
the education department at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers, who is on vacation in Hawaii, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, who was named the first female Rotarian of Merced in 1988, is a 
member of the Merced Chamber of Commerce. She received all of her degrees at 
the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. In 1969 she began teaching at Modesto 
Junior College, moving up through various administrative posts. She became vice 
president of instruction at Merced College in 1985.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS FILED IN COMPTON; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDER GAVE THOUSANDS TO INCUMBENTS

<P>
One of the city's most successful developers raised and donated thousands of 
dollars to the campaigns of incumbent councilmen and the mayor, according to 
campaign finance reports filed this week. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that I'm about is motivating black people to give to black 
candidates," said the developer, Danny Bakewell. Too often, he said, black 
candidates must depend on contributions from white supporters who live outside 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Honored to Give' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel honored to give," Bakewell said. "I feel a responsibility to support 
people who are supporting good government in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contribution and spending reports show that Councilman Robert L. Adams 
collected $13,000 by April 1, all of it in $1,000 contributions from 13 
different people. Under state law, single contributors may not give more than 
$1,000 to a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 are at least six people close to Bakewell. They include his wife, 
Aline; his business partner Lonnie R. Bunkley and Bunkley's wife, Charlene, and 
Bakewell's sister, Pamela Bakewell Brooks, who is on leave as executive 
director of the Brotherhood Crusade. 
</P>
<P>
Bakewell is president of the Brotherhood Crusade, an agency similar to United 
Way based in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing $1,000, according to the state-required campaign report, were 
Brenda Marsh, who is Bakewell's special assistant at the Crusade, and Yussuf J. 
Simmonds, who acts as a representative for Bakewell's firm, Compton Community 
Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The same six people also gave $1,000 each to Councilmen Floyd A. James, whose 
report shows that he collected a total of $12,701 between March 5 and April 1, 
the time period covered in the campaign reports. 
</P>
<P>
"With the campaign contribution law of a $1,000 limit," Bakewell said, "that's 
what you have to do, is try to reach out to people who will give, who will 
support good government." 
</P>
<P>
James lost his reelection bid in the April 18 balloting to Patricia A. Moore. 
Adams was forced into a June 6 runoff election against Compton school board 
Trustee Bernice Woods. 
</P>
<P>
Bakewell said he supported the incumbent councilmen because under their 
leadership the city has made substantial progress in its effort to economically 
revitalize the community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need to Look at Good Done 
</P>
<P>
"I think you really have to look at what good has been done for the city," 
Bakewell said, pointing to his success in developing the downtown's only 
shopping center. With help from the city's Redevelopment Agency, he is 
developing a second shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Bakewell's name does not appear as a contributor on either James' or Adams' 
reports, although it did show up on Mayor Walter R. Tucker's report. The mayor, 
who was also forced into a runoff, got $1,000 from Bakewell. The mayor also 
received $1,000 from Bunkley and $1,000 from Bakewell's development firm. 
</P>
<P>
Another $1,000 contributor to both James and Adams, according to their reports, 
was Yoshiko A. Morris. Both reports list a Los Angeles address for Morris that 
is the same address listed for Lonnie and Charlene Bunkley. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Woods, chairman of Hub City Developers Inc., also gave $1,000 each to 
Adams and James. Woods said the contributions were not connected to a recent 
vote by the City Council to settle a long-standing debt the nonprofit housing 
firm owed the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hub City was the subject of a recent critical federal audit that urged Compton 
to foreclose on the firm in order to recoup a $2-million federal grant that the 
city funneled to the company. Hub City was to use the grant, as well as about 
$3 million it got in direct city loans, to build low-income housing. The 
housing, however, was never built, and Hub City did not repay the money. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of foreclosing on Hub City, the City Council on a 3-2 vote agreed to 
accept as payment a parcel of land Hub City had near the Artesia Freeway. 
Critics of the agreement claimed that the city had given Hub City the land in 
the first place. Woods pointed out that he gave contributions to both Adams and 
James, although Adams voted against the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other $1,000 contributors to Adams were Shirley Mims, John Mims, 
Rosie Johnson, Jack Bortnick and Sonia Bresnelian. Among James' contributors 
were Shirley and John Mims, $1,000 each, and William A. Johnson, $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
James could not be reached for comment, and Adams said he does not know any of 
the $1,000 contributors listed above. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a different area of the campaign," Adams said, saying that he has a 
finance committee that raises money for him. "You can't get your message out to 
the people if you don't have money for printing and postage," he said. "It's 
costly, very costly to campaign today and the people who contributed to me want 
the continuation of good government in Compton." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Late Reports 
</P>
<P>
Adams and James, as well as several other candidates, face fines of at least 
$10 a day because they did not file their campaign reports by the April 6 
deadline. James filed his report last Friday. Adams filed his Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who will take her council seat July 1, did not file her report until 
last Thursday. But City Clerk Charles Davis said she will probably not be fined 
because a letter accompanied the report saying it was late because her campaign 
treasurer was ill and had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Moore reported collecting $8,200 between March 5 and April 1, much of it in 
$500 contributions from family members -- her mother, stepfather, sister, 
cousins and an uncle. Other contributors were: Tom Stemnock of Sherman Oaks, an 
engineer, $1,000; Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton), $500; Duke and Jo's Garage 
in Compton, $100, and Kofi Boateng, a gas station owner in Paramount, $100. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also reported having raised $3,500 at a $25-per-ticket fund-raiser. 
Individual contributions of less than $100 do not have to be reported.

NORWALK BALKS AT DESIGN OF FREEWAY OFF-RAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has called for a halt in construction of the Century Freeway 
in Norwalk until the off-ramp system can be redesigned to avoid clogging city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved a resolution Tuesday night requesting that the 
California Department of Transportation stop construction on the eastern end of 
the I-105. The council also directed City Atty. Steven L. Dorsey to investigate 
whether the city could obtain a court order, if necessary, to stop 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they decided to go on the offensive after earlier efforts 
failed to produce improvements in the off-ramp system, which is under 
construction. A May, 1987, letter to Caltrans, for example, told of the city's 
traffic concerns. City officials fear that portions of Imperial Highway and 
Studebaker Road will become gridlocked once the Century Freeway opens and a 
planned park-and-ride lot and light-rail transit station are put into 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it takes more than a carrot in front of a mule to move him," 
Councilman Robert E. White said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, backed by state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk), are scheduled 
to meet in Sacramento today with Caltrans officials to try to resolve their 
differences. City Manager Richard R. Powers also said the city wants a 
guarantee from Caltrans that the agency will pay for any street improvements 
that become necessary once the freeway is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans District Director Jerry Baxter said his agency will present a new 
off-ramp plan to city staff members on Friday. But Baxter declined to provide 
details of the plan because of the continuing negotiations with Norwalk. Baxter 
said there is little chance that construction of the freeway would be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are ways to work it out without stopping construction," Baxter 
said. "We think we have a solution." 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the dispute is a new off-ramp system to serve a park-and-ride 
lot and a light-rail station that will be built where the Century Freeway 
crosses over the San Gabriel River (605) Freeway and abruptly ends. The 
facility is expected to draw hundreds of motorists from both the Century 
Freeway and the 605. 
</P>
<P>
To provide access, Caltrans is building an off-ramp from the northbound 605 
that will route traffic onto Imperial Highway. Motorists would have to travel 
east on Imperial Highway and then south on Studebaker Road to reach the 
entrance of the park-and-ride lot and the rail station. Motorists traveling 
southbound on the 605 would exit on Imperial and use the same roadways to reach 
the park-and-ride lot. Traffic coming off the Century Freeway would exit 
directly onto Studebaker and enter into the park-and-ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk officials and a group called Citizens Under Freeway Fallout (CUFF) 
would like northbound traffic from the 605 to be channeled almost directly into 
the park-and-ride lot and kept off Imperial and Studebaker. Motorists traveling 
south on the 605 would exit on Imperial Highway and be channeled down Hoxie 
Avenue, instead of heading further east on Imperial to Studebaker. 
</P>
<P>
A November, 1988, engineering report prepared for the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission indicates that the alternate plan would reduce 
traffic congestion in the area. The Transportation Commission is overseeing 
development of the light-rail line that runs down the 105 Freeway and the 
Norwalk rail-transit station at the line's eastern end. Bus lines also will 
serve the area. 
</P>
<P>
The park-and-ride lot will contain 2,000 spaces, and about 950 vehicles are 
expected to arrive during the morning peak hour alone, according to the 
Transportation Commission report. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter said Caltrans decided on the current off-ramp design because it would 
channel traffic away from some residential areas. He said there are some design 
problems associated with the alternate plan, which would require the relocation 
of a planned bus turnaround. The alternate system would cost an additional $1.5 
million, the Transportation Commission report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Urgent Objective 
</P>
<P>
"The cost does not determine our concern," Baxter said. "We're more concerned 
with getting a proper design, one we can all accept." 
</P>
<P>
Powers, the city manager, said changing the ramp design is the most pressing 
objective. But he said he also will seek a guarantee that Caltrans will pay for 
any local street improvements that become necessary. That could include sound 
walls and street closures to deal with traffic problems. Powers and residents, 
for example, fear that motorists will get off the Century Freeway and use city 
streets to reach the nearby Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
CUFF chairwoman Nancy Luque said Caltrans should bend over backwards to make 
sure area residents are satisfied. Luque lives several blocks from the end of 
the Century Freeway and the park-and-ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is going to be here to stay," she said. "Caltrans does not have a 
right to dictate to the citizens what's acceptable."

PARK GROUND BROKEN FOR HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ashes of the millions who were put to death by Nazi Germany were ground 
into the earth of Eastern Europe long ago, and many concentration camp 
survivors have nowhere to go to mourn their dead. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on the horrors of those years, Lydia Budgor paused with a catch in 
her throat as work began Tuesday in Pan Pacific Park on a monument to victims 
of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mood of Period 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us survivors don't have any graves to come to, to meditate and to 
pray," she said. "This is a place where I will come several times a year to sit 
down and meditate and pray and say this is part of me and my family." 
</P>
<P>
Budgor is president of the Council of Postwar Jewish Organizations and Nazi 
Holocaust Survivors of Southern California, some of whose members have been 
working for more than 20 years to establish a memorial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 of them gathered on a grassy slope at the north end of the Fairfax 
District park to embrace, listen to brief speeches and turn the first spades of 
earth for construction of the six black granite pillars that will make up the 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not attempt to do what history books would do, but it helps create the 
mood of the period," said Joseph Young, its designer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lighted Lamps 
</P>
<P>
Topped by lamps that will be lit for 24 hours once a year to mark Yom Hashoa, 
the international day of Holocaust remembrance, each pillar will carry a bas 
relief showing a scene from the destruction of European Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve more plaques will tell the story of the period, from Adolf Hitler's rise 
to power in 1933 to the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"Since our families perished in the Holocaust, we wanted to have a place where 
we can mourn them and we can always remember them," said Otto Schirn, a native 
of Vienna and survivor of the Auschwitz death camp. "We wanted to do it in a 
public place where everybody can share our sorrow with us." 
</P>
<P>
Schirn, longtime president of a group of concentration camp survivors from 
Poland, said he has been working on the project since the late 1960s. But it 
was only four years ago that permission was granted to place the monument in 
the park, which is located between Beverly Boulevard and 3rd Street in the 
heart of the city's Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Edelman Credited 
</P>
<P>
Schirn credited county Supervisor Ed Edelman with coming up with the site and 
with prodding real estate developer Jona Goldrich to chair the fund-raising 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Edelman said you've got to take this on, otherwise this monument will never 
be built," said Goldrich, who fled Nazi-occupied Poland as a teen-ager in 1942. 
"I think the Holocaust is important for everybody to know about, not just 
Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
Goldrich said he has raised $220,000 toward the $1.4-million project, with an 
additional $230,000 in pledges. 
</P>
<P>
With the Simon Wiesenthal Center seeking donations for its museum on Pico 
Boulevard, the Martyrs Memorial museum of the Jewish Federation Council moving 
into new quarters on Wilshire Boulevard and fund-raising under way for the U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, "some people say, 'How many Holocaust 
things do we need?' "Goldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his response is that the museums will serve people who know about the 
Holocaust and are seeking to learn more, while the monument in Pan Pacific Park 
will alert future generations who know nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to make an impression in this city. It's got to be overwhelming," he 
said. "If you built a monument on every street corner in Los Angeles, you 
couldn't tell the story. That's how horrible (the Holocaust) was." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is not a survivor of the concentration camps, Young said the theme 
of the monument is a familiar one. 
</P>
<P>
"Like many people, I did have relatives who were lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young's resume includes murals at UCLA, the 84-foot-high west apse of the 
Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington and mosaics in several Los 
Angeles synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trust Fund Established 
</P>
<P>
An agreement calls for the county to provide security and routine maintenance 
for the monument, and the sponsors are responsible for setting up a trust fund 
to cover extraordinary maintenance problems such as those that crippled the 
Triforium, Young's most visible work. 
</P>
<P>
Erected in City Hall Mall in downtown Los Angeles in 1975, the six-story 
Triforium was supposed to broadcast recorded music from its self-contained 
glass bell carillon as a computer told 1,494 colored glass prisms when to light 
up, and how brightly. 
</P>
<P>
But its moving parts soon broke down, and the Triforium has been dark and quiet 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"That baby was born years ago and it has to grow up on its own," Young said. 
"It would be nice if the city would learn how to use it." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Holocaust monument would be fashioned from heavy, two-inch 
slabs of imported black granite and that he and two assistants would make 
plaster casts of the bas reliefs to be cast in bronze at a foundry. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully it will be completed by next year, so that the flames can be lit for 
Yom Hashoa in reality," he said. The commemoration day, based on the Jewish 
calendar, occurs in the spring. This year it was Tuesday.

ROYAL TREATMENT FOR A FADED CASTLE; 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA LANDMARK TO BE RESTORED

<TEXT>
<P>
From the corner of Raymond Avenue and Green Street, the Castle Green looms 
above rooftops of Old Pasadena like a musty, decayed vision of the city's grand 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Once considered the most sumptuous and exotic building in the city, the Castle 
Green has slowly weathered over the years into a soot-covered amalgam of 
peeling paint, cracked stucco and rusting ironwork. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it suffered from deferred maintenance," said Claire Bogaard, 
executive director of the historical preservation group, Pasadena Heritage. 
"It's a bit shabby." 
</P>
<P>
But with the help of a $693,000 state grant awarded this month, Pasadena 
Heritage and the 39 owners of what is now a cooperative apartment building are 
set to embark on an ambitious plan to restore the exterior of the building to 
its old luster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restored to Original Condition 
</P>
<P>
Everything from its intricate Moorish plaster embellishments to window screens 
and copper gutters are to be restored to their original condition. 
</P>
<P>
Bogaard said if all goes as planned, craftsman skilled in the antique trades of 
molding tin, repairing ancient plumbing and reforming cast plaster reliefs will 
finish their work by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, the city of Pasadena, Pasadena Heritage and the residents of 
Castle Green are going to be very proud of this building," said Willa Foster, 
who has lived in the building since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Castle Green, originally part of the Hotel Green, is one of 33 projects in 
the state awarded grants from a one-time $11-million state fund earmarked for 
historical preservation and archeological projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Champion of the Cause 
</P>
<P>
Other projects that received grants include the old Chinatown site in 
Riverside, the sandstone camel barns in Benecia in northern California and the 
Thomas Fallon House in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Heritage decided to champion the cause of the Castle Green because it 
is close to the historic district of Old Pasadena, is one of the most widely 
recognized landmarks in the city and can be rented by the public for special 
events. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the residents of the building gave Pasadena Heritage legal control 
over the facade of the building, meaning that the group will always be able to 
control any changes in the Castle Green's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The building's eclectic mix of architectural styles has endeared it to 
generations of Pasadenans who have described it at various times as elegant, 
gloomy, charming, glorious, awesome and creepy. 
</P>
<P>
Film makers have used the 91-year-old structure as a stand-in for the French 
embassy in Turkey, a building in Hanoi, a funeral parlor in Chicago and, yes, 
even a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this building, it has such an ambience," resident Steve Hoskinson said. 
"It's sort of a dream to live here." 
</P>
<P>
The building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is one of 
the last vestiges of the great turn-of-the-century hotels that forged 
Pasadena's early reputation as a winter resort for the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
The Raymond and the Maryland were demolished in the 1930s. The Huntington has 
just been demolished to make way for a new hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The only hotels that remain are the Vista del Arroyo, which houses the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, and two buildings of the Hotel Green. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modest Beginnings 
</P>
<P>
The hotel began life as a modest two-story building called the Webster Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Construction began in 1887, but financial problems forced its owner, E.C. 
Webster, to sell the property two years later to an affluent Easterner who had 
fallen in love with Southern California and settled in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner was Col. G.G. Green, who had made his fortune selling such 
popular elixirs of the time as "Green's August Flower" and "Green's Ague 
Conqueror." 
</P>
<P>
He set out to build the humble Webster Hotel into a veritable gem in the 
sunbaked flatlands below the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
First, he enlarged the hotel to a five-story building, which was designed with 
a mixture of Spanish, Mexican and Moorish influences by architect Frederick L. 
Roehrig. 
</P>
<P>
In 1898, he built a western annex on the other side of Raymond Avenue that was 
even more exotically designed with Victorian, Mediterranean and pronounced 
Moorish features. A bridge that looked as if it was part of an ancient fortress 
was built over Raymond Avenue to connect the two buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Another wing was added to the western annex in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demolished in 1935 
</P>
<P>
The main building of the Hotel Green was demolished in 1935, and today the 
property is occupied by a large floral supply store. 
</P>
<P>
But the western annex, which came to be called the Castle Green, and the 1903 
addition, which is now a low-income senior housing facility called the Green 
Hotel Apartments, survived. 
</P>
<P>
The Castle Green escaped the wrecking ball largely because of a unusual 
arrangement reached in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
A group of regular guests who wanted to stay beyond the winter resort season 
decided to buy the building and divide it into apartments. It has stayed a 
cooperatively owned apartment building ever since, in part because no one has 
ever managed to get all the owners to agree to sell the building. 
</P>
<P>
The studio and one-bedroom apartments now sell for about $80,000 to $100,000, 
according to business manager Cadie Marotta. The owners of the apartments pay a 
fee of about $200 to $500 a month to maintain the building. 
</P>
<P>
The maintenance fee has never been enough to undertake a full-scale restoration 
-- a factor that has been both an asset and a liability, Bogaard said. 
</P>
<P>
Although many owners have transformed their own apartments into modern wonders, 
they have done little to the rest of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the Castle Green has decayed over the years, but it has also 
remained intact, like a faded newspaper in a time capsule. 
</P>
<P>
Bogaard said chances are good that the paint, ironwork and plaster detailing 
have never been touched, making the job of determining the original condition 
of the building far easier. A six-inch stack of the original architectural 
drawings has also been saved over the years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bogaard said study of the building will begin this summer, detailing the 
restoration of not only its exterior, but the interior as well. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Heritage will only be involved in the exterior restoration. The 
interior work will be left to the residents of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Marotta said the interior restoration will take place over a long period of 
time as residents raise the money to proceed.

POMONA OUSTS WILSON AS CITY ADMINISTRATOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
During his 13-month tenure as city administrator, A. J. Wilson was billed as 
either a managerial messiah or a marauder. Supporters and detractors now agree 
he was the victim of that split opinion. 
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected move, one of the first actions taken by a newly reconstituted 
City Council Monday was to fire Wilson in closed session. He had lost favor 
with a new council majority led by C. L. (Clay) Bryant. Bryant had made 
previous attempts to oust Wilson but lacked the required votes until this week. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant was joined by colleagues Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua -- who was sworn into 
office last week -- in voting to fire Wilson. Mayor Donna Smith supported 
Wilson, while Councilman Mark Nymeyer walked out of the council's executive 
session in protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Messiah' 
</P>
<P>
In making the motion to fire Wilson, Bryant said it became clear in recent 
months that Wilson could not fulfill expectations. "You could tell he was just 
a bureaucrat, not a messiah," Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith and Nymeyer said the high-powered administrator had lived up to the 
hype that surrounded his hiring in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Mr. Wilson was one of the best things that happened to this 
city," Smith said. "I feel Pomona's future is in serious jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone with any brains is not going to apply for the manager's job in Pomona," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer concurred, saying: "Mr. Wilson had a vision for what this town could 
become." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 47, whose personal residence is in Fallbrook, could not be reached for 
comment. As part of a buyout clause in his contract, Wilson will receive five 
months of his annual salary and benefits for a total of about $125,000. City 
Atty. Patrick J. Sampson was named as interim city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Pomona, Wilson had been out of city government for three 
years, working as a management consultant for corporations. Wilson's reputation 
was that of a forceful leader who found novel solutions for longstanding 
problems of urban decay and economic stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collision Course 
</P>
<P>
It may have been this same forceful personality and drive -- which supporters 
say are among Wilson's greatest attributes -- that set him on a collision 
course with the new council majority. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson had spent 20 years in government, including largely successful stints 
overseeing Santa Ana, Portland, Me., and his hometown of St. Louis. But 
Wilson's last city manager's job ended in controversy in 1984, when he resigned 
under pressure in Kansas City, Mo., after 14 troubled months. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the same criticisms leveled at Wilson in Kansas City -- that he usurped 
elected officials' authority and prestige -- were cited as reasons for his 
firing in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the same problems in St. Louis, Santa Ana and Kansas City," Bryant 
said. "I'd hate to feel that the council is working for him, instead of vice 
versa." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant and Soto accused Wilson of being largely unaccountable to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings were cancelled and times changed without notifying council members and 
often official requests were answered with empty promises for action, Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hell of a way to do business," Bryant said, citing an instance when the 
council directed Wilson to seek assistance from the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department to deal with gangs in the city. "He was told to make an 
immediate request for assistance; he asked for a study instead," Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favoritism Cited 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Bryant charged, Wilson filled a city position with an 
acquaintance instead of advertising the post as dictated by council policy. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Nymeyer, however, denied that Wilson was implementing his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pomona City Council sat down with Mr. Wilson and we set the goals," Smith 
said. "Every program or project that was carried out was in line with those 
goals." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Bryant was jealous of Wilson and seeking to show his new political 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bryant has stated on more than one occasion that he is jealous of the 
power the city administrator has," she said. "He wants a city administrator 
that only he alone can control. This was more for personal reasons; Mr. Bryant 
could not control Mr. Wilson and that's why he got rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
Ursua, although admittedly a novice on the council, said he was qualified to 
vote for Wilson's ouster because he knew Pomona under the old political guard 
-- the same group that hired Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First to Go 
</P>
<P>
Likening the new council majority to a corporate takeover, Ursua noted that the 
old chief executive officer is always the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the administration has to know who's in charge now, and that's the 
best way to get it across," Ursua said. "You get rid of the CEO." 
</P>
<P>
Ursua said he objected to Wilson wanting to push Pomona into more commercial 
development even though the city has a critical need for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Although she voted for hiring Wilson, Soto said she always objected to his 
large salary and his condition that he be allowed to continue to run his 
consulting company. "I thought his demands on salary and concessions we had to 
make were a little bit too much for Pomona." 
</P>
<P>
Richard E. Yochum, president of the Pomona Chamber of Commerce, said: "We're 
disappointed and dismayed," by the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
While many of Wilson's plans had not come to fruition, Yochum said, the chamber 
liked the direction the administrator had pursued. 
</P>
<P>
"With A. J.'s termination, we'll just have to wait to see what the city brings 
in new management and if they can continue the movement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer charged that Wilson was fired for not bowing to Bryant's whims. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to pay someone to tell us what we already think, why waste the 
public's money," Nymeyer said. "Frankly, I'm just disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
A central issue in Wilson's firing appears to be the city's ongoing plans to 
develop a regional shopping mall. The mall, which would cover 74 acres near the 
intersection of the Pomona Freeway and Corona Expressway, would require a 
complicated funding scheme requiring county assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The county has agreed to contribute $31.3 million for the shopping center in 
return for more than $61 million in increased revenue through the city issuing 
bonds and from increased revenues of various city redevelopment projects over 
the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said he was alarmed by the long-term monetary commitment and thought the 
city was doing too much to placate the project developers. 
</P>
<P>
But Nymeyer said the mall project, and the creative financing structure, were 
exactly what the council wanted from Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular move by the City Council could seriously jeopardize that," 
Nymeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Soto, however, said that "nothing will happen to the (project) without having 
A. J. around. He doesn't walk on water." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant also charged that Wilson had been derelict in not effectively combatting 
the city's spiraling problems with street gangs and drug dealers. As the city's 
top administrator, Wilson should have overseen the allocation of resources, 
Bryant asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer said that was never Wilson's job.

MONROVIA OKS PLAN FOR PECK ROAD INDUSTRIAL AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

MONROVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A zoning plan to make an industrial area in south Monrovia more tolerable to 
neighbors was unanimously adopted by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "Peck Road Specific Plan," the ordinance will enable the city to 
regulate development in the area so that auto dismantling and salvage 
operations or "other miscellaneous industrial uses" do not disrupt about 200 
homeowners in an unincorporated area west of the site. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-acre area on the southwest corner of Live Oak Avenue and Peck Road is 
also bordered by a Monrovia gravel pit on the east, and commercial and vacant 
county properties to the north and south. 
</P>
<P>
Now zoned for planned development, the site houses five auto salvage facilities 
on 22 acres, a building materials salvage yard and a roofing materials 
business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Decades of Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which had been approved by the Planning Commission 6 to 1 at its Jan. 
11 meeting, follows two decades of resident complaints. It is the result of 
nine months of negotiations among city staff, business owners and county 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the major property owner, Parts Country Inc., must create and 
maintain a 30-foot-wide buffer landscaped with shrubbery, evergreen trees and 
oleanders along the 1,500-foot boundary between the businesses and homes. The 
east and south boundaries must also be landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
Entrances on Mayflower and Live Oak avenues to the salvage yards will be 
closed. A common access for customers is allowed on South Peck Road, away from 
any homes. 
</P>
<P>
The businesses may continue to operate seven days a week, although crushing 
activities will be prohibited on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation will begin July 1 with a Jan. 31, 1990, deadline for compliance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar to 1974 Ordinance 
</P>
<P>
The plan is similar to one adopted by the City Council in 1974. That ordinance 
also required the closing of the Mayflower and Live Oak entrances, as well as 
the building of an eight-foot-high earthen barrier between the yards and the 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
But when Parts Country President Clayton Hurley challenged the law in court, 
the county and the residents declined to finance a defense, a city official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point the city was unwilling to spend money fighting for the ordinance 
because those involved were county, not Monrovia, residents. Thus, the plan was 
never implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The area had been used as a gravel pit and later a landfill. In 1967, a mobile 
home park on the land was condemned by the state because the land was sinking 
and methane gas from decomposing garbage in the former landfill was leaking. 
That same year, Monrovia issued a conditional-use permit for auto dismantling 
businesses on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors were not thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
Protest from residents prompted the City Council to adopt the 1974 plan, and 
complaints continued after that failed. 
</P>
<P>
About 170 homeowners sent post cards to Mayor Bob Bartlett last year asking him 
to "please eliminate the junkyards and rezone the land for more compatible 
use," according to homeowner Shirley Rechtin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Other Choice' 
</P>
<P>
"They were repairing cars on the street," she said, adding that she has been 
complaining about odor, noise and dust from the auto wreckers since they began 
operations. Saying she would rather the businesses leave the area completely, 
she conceded that she is accepting the city's compromise because "we have no 
other choice." 
</P>
<P>
Customers park their cars on residential streets, said Ken Angell, who lives 
three blocks from the entrance to Pick-A-Part, one of the main salvage 
businesses at the site. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday mornings, the line of customers waiting for the yards to open extends 
two blocks on residential streets, he said, trapping residents' cars in their 
driveways. 
</P>
<P>
"We're around grease and stuff like that," he said. "They do testing on old 
cars without mufflers. They would leave parts on the streets -- seats, fenders, 
hoods. . . . It's put a lot of stress on the people in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Parts Country President Hurley said mechanics sometimes had to work on the 
streets because there was not enough space in the yards. He noted that 
off-street parking will be expanded and that all the traffic would be moved to 
Peck Road with the new entrance. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was disappointed that the council rejected his proposal to reduce 
the buffer width to 10 feet but said he will abide by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mandeville, an environmental consultant hired by Hurley, warned the 
council that the buffer could trap the methane gas from the old landfill, 
causing it to escape nearer the homes. But David Herrera, the city's 
consultant, responded that the risk is minimal.

FORGOTTEN TRAIN CAR TURNS OUT TO BE A NUGGET OF AMERICANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Little Nugget lived only 20 years. Then it fell into a purgatory for 30 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Donated in 1956 to the city it had served, the Little Nugget was abandoned to a 
sidetrack in Travel Town. Children tromped through it by day; vandals and 
squatters stole in by night. Sunlight unsealed its exterior. Rain seeped in. 
Paintings, molded cherubs, brass sconces, Victorian lounge chairs disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Then, about two years ago, the American Southwestern Railway Assn. stepped in. 
Some of its members decided that they could no longer stand idle while the most 
lavish railroad car of its day crept into ignominy. They set about to restore 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a job that has tantalizingly grown larger with every step it has 
moved ahead. It's grown in duration, in cost, in complexity. On the happier 
side, it's also grown in its sense of historical mission. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the group of about 20 railroad buffs merely thought of the Nugget as 
an important piece of railroad lore. It had been the lounge car on Union 
Pacific's City of Los Angeles Streamliner that worked the Chicago-California 
route from 1937 to 1956. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was a fairly well-known railroad car and was nice looking," said 
Nancy Jessup, the group's fund-raiser. "Then, when we really got into it and 
discovered the whole Walter Kuhn business, we found out it was a piece of 
Americana. We think of it as a work of art." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn was a noted American painter and designer. Union Pacific commissioned him 
to make one car stand out in almost comic contrast to the cool Art Deco lines 
of the 14-car City of Los Angeles. The idea was to create an 1880s Old West 
dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn threw himself into the job for more than a year, making it his 
masterpiece. He selected the drapery fabrics, the paint colors and hardware 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kuhn was quite the perfectionist," Jessup said. 
</P>
<P>
He gave the Little Nugget rococo chairs and sofas, brass gaslight fixtures, 
embroidered lace curtains, velvet drapes and a cherub-studded bar. On its walls 
he put paintings, drawings and photographs of vaudeville performers, clowns, 
dancers and jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn even gave the Nugget its name and painted 35 of its illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Nugget remains the only surviving example of Kuhn's railroad work, 
said Greg Gneier, historian for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Gneier, a Hollywood studio designer, discovered the "Kuhn business" on 
microfilm. He obtained it from the Smithsonian Institution, which has preserved 
the exhaustive correspondence in which Kuhn can be seen tending to the smallest 
detail, including the ordering of individual parts. 
</P>
<P>
Two Saturdays a month now, three to six members of the team show up at the 
faded yellow-and-gray Union Pacific car, where they find themselves tracing 
Kuhn's steps quite literally. With a party invariably in progress in the next 
car over, they sand, they scrape, they hammer and paint. They fret over the 
rigors of historical purity. Is it legitimate, they ask, to re-secure a ceiling 
panel with a row of Phillips screws of which not one was used in the original 
Little Nugget? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Screws Scavenged 
</P>
<P>
Gneier said the problem came up when he learned that slotted screws are no 
longer manufactured in the shape he needed. So far, he's solved it by 
scavenging screws from one side of the car to finish off the other. 
</P>
<P>
Someday the question must be faced. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the project moves ahead on faith, sweat and ingenuity, a combination 
that has had some success. In their first look at the car, the restorers found 
only one of the nearly two dozen fanciful, velvet-covered chairs that lined 
both sides of the Nugget. 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that city employees carted off most of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been knocking on doors and making phone calls," Gneier said. "One day, 
these two chairs appeared." 
</P>
<P>
Gneier hopes that more will turn up. Those that don't will have to be replaced, 
at several hundred dollars per chair. 
</P>
<P>
Gneier has had better luck in reincarnating manufactured goods from the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote to Harrington &amp; King Perforating Co. in Chicago, hoping to find 
perforated metal vent covers. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy said they still had one little old man there who knew how to operate 
the machines," he said. "They had to pull out all the tooling." 
</P>
<P>
The same company cast the cherubs hung above the light fixtures. Someone has 
been assigned to dig through an old warehouse to find the mold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cherubs Recast 
</P>
<P>
The small cherubs on the bar were simply recast from the one that remained. One 
member of the team now works at home, carving in the fine detail. 
</P>
<P>
Another works at home sewing drapes from the 200 yards of velour sent by 
Collins &amp; Aikman, the company that manufactured the originals. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, the artists on the team may find themselves copying the original Kuhn 
paintings from a photograph. All but two disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"For all we know, they could be in a bar somewhere," Jessup said. "We're hoping 
the city has them stuck in a warehouse. If nothing else, we will repaint them 
and say, 'This is what Mr. Kuhn's paintings looked like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still other items will be easy to replace, as soon as funds arrive. Little 
yellow signs in the car identify them: 
</P>
<P>
"Cost of replacing lamp globes (29) $175," one says. 
</P>
<P>
Another, slightly more intimidating, says: "Cost of replacing carpet with 
original 'cabbage rose' design, $4,500-$7,000." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Work Ahead 
</P>
<P>
That purchase lies well in the future, and may cost even more. More immediate, 
and lowly, tasks allow plenty of time for dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Jessup rubbed Ditz-O wax and grease remover onto a dirty aluminum 
strip that came off a door. As she worked, she contemplated the ways of making 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"Since this was the lounge car, everybody who was in it smoked," she said. 
Their smoke left a deep residue that oozed with every shot of cleanser. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe we should call 409 and have them come out and do a commercial," 
Jessup said. 
</P>

MOTEL EXPANSION REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to prohibit expansion of the 
Comfort Inn on Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Doug Lowe failed to convince council members that he had met 
requirements to add more parking and build deeper setbacks. His plan calls for 
a four-story addition with 66 rooms onto the existing three-story motel. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lowe had lowered the height of the addition and added some parking, 
council members said the design still did not meet city zoning codes. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen neighborhood activists opposed to the project claimed that it violated 
several city regulations that govern setback sizes, land use and the placement 
of on-site loading zones. Residents also argued that the increase in street 
parking, traffic congestion and density would adversely affect their 
neighborhood.

INTERSECTION STUDY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, this week decided to 
allocate $20,000 for a study the agency hopes will lead to an innovative and 
relatively inexpensive design for the Slauson Avenue/Marina Freeway 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has been working for several years on plans for a flyover, or 
viaduct, at the intersection that would cut delays caused by vehicles turning 
left onto Slauson at the end of the freeway. City staff members said 
preliminary estimates for the cost of such a project run from $8 million to $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The conceptual study approved by the agency calls for a design for the 
intersection that would keep all traffic on the same level, yet improve traffic 
flow while permitting left-hand turns. The cost of implementing the design, if 
feasible, would be less than $1 million, according to an agency report. 
</P>
<P>
A representative from F. Mier &amp; Associates, which will prepare the study, 
said the company is working on a similar design for two intersections in New 
York City and has a patent pending on the concept.

RHOADS SCHOLARSHIP FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scholarship fund in memory of Randy Rhoads, a rock guitarist for the Ozzy 
Ozbourne band who died in a plane crash in 1982, has been established at the 
UCLA College of Fine Arts for the study of classical guitar, according to J. 
Bernard Kester, dean of the college. 
</P>
<P>
The $50,000 gift for the scholarship came from a trust fund of Rhoads' career 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoads was a classical music devotee and had planned to enter the guitar 
performance program at UCLA, said his mother, Delores Rhoads, a music teacher 
and owner of the Musonia School in North Hollywood.

$46,400 ALLOCATED FOR ANTI-GANG INSTRUCTION

<P>
The South Gate City Council has voted to spend $46,400 to start an anti-gang 
program in the city's elementary schools and one junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved spending the money for anti-gang instruction 
for fourth- and fifth-grade students at the city's nine elementary schools and 
South Gate Junior High School, which are on a year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 students will receive instruction from counselors from the county 
Juvenile Assistance Diversion Effort program. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ron George said he hopes the nine-week course, which begins this 
week, will help youths "resist the pressures of joining a gang." 
</P>
<P>
Funds for the program come from the South Gate Police Department's share of 
assets seized in a narcotics raid.

AGENCY VOTES FUNDS TO HELP REMODEL SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Norwalk Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday voted to spend up to $550,000 to 
assist in the remodeling of the Norwalk Square shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
West Venture Development Co., which owns the shopping center, plans to remodel 
all buildings facing Pioneer Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue using a Spanish 
architectural theme. West Venture also plans to build a multiscreen theater and 
an 8,140-square-foot commercial building on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The retail shopping center is one of the key projects in the city's plans to 
develop a Spanish-style village, of sorts, along San Antonio Drive from the 
Santa Ana Freeway to Rosecrans. The city plans to use redevelopment and federal 
grant money. 
</P>
<P>
A report by Donald J. Rouly, Norwalk director of economic development, said 
some details of the project still have to be worked out, but that the agency 
would contribute up to $550,000.

PRAISE IN MEMORY OF CAM BRIGLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cam Briglio (the former Monterey Park mayor who died April 25) was a guy you 
couldn't miss. He was as big as life, and he got you coming and going every 
time. You couldn't ruffle his feathers or back him down, and you often came 
away with a higher temperature or cursing under your breath. 
</P>
<P>
But whether you liked him or not, agreed or disagreed with him, it was 
difficult to doubt his sincerity. Honesty compelled, at the very least, a 
grudging respect for Cam, who always displayed the courage of his convictions, 
regardless of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
With Cam, you always knew where you stood. . . . An adversary had to always be 
ready for a rough and tumble affair. 
</P>
<P>
But beneath Cam's tough exterior was a kind, considerate and lovable soul. He 
was a devoted father and husband who gave to his family much of what he missed 
as an orphaned child. And, as a friend, you could always count on him to be 
there when you needed him. 
</P>
<P>
Cam was a true gladiator who fought hard for what he believed in and gave 
unselfishly to Monterey Park, as councilman, mayor and private citizen. . . . 
He contributed four exciting, interesting and productive years to city 
government, during which we successfully hosted an Olympic event and gained for 
Monterey Park "All American City" status. 
</P>
<P>
I liked Cam, my council colleague and friend of many years. We shall miss you, 
old friend. May you rest in peace in a happier and better place. Monterey Park 
will never be the same without you.

TORRES OPPOSES EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) has joined San Gabriel Valley water 
agencies in urging the state Water Resources Control Board to reject a permit 
for expansion of the Azusa Land Reclamation Co.'s landfill in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed site is not suited for a landfill since ground-water sources are 
located directly under the area and are used for the drinking needs of the 
residents," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board approved a permit last 
year for disposal in new areas of the landfill under conditions that would 
require the use of clay soil and a plastic liner to keep contaminants from 
seeping into ground water. But the San Gabriel Valley Watermaster, an 
organization that allocates the use of ground water in the Main San Gabriel 
Basin, appealed the decision to the state board. The board's staff has 
recommended that the regional decision be overturned.

Three residents from Azusa, Covina and Pasadena who helped in the arrests of 
crime suspects were among eight Los Angeles-area residents honored by Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth annual Courageous Citizens Award ceremony held at Pasadena Superior 
Court is part of an on-going program to recognize civilians who assist in the 
capture or conviction of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Jean LaFrenierre, 40, of Azusa was driving home in 1987 when she saw a 
man hovering over a body in Los Angeles. When the man drove away with an 
accomplice, LaFrenierre gave chase at speeds exceeding 80 m.p.h. until both 
cars were stopped by police. Her testimony later helped obtain murder 
convictions of both men. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick M. Clisham, 43, of Covina witnessed a sexual assault in a Covina 
laundry one night in 1987 and noted the license plate number of the suspect's 
car as he fled. Police later arrested the man. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Nembhard , 35, an RTD driver from Pasadena and Jose Lechuga, 23, of Los 
Angeles chased two suspects who robbed a 76-year-old man on a bus last year. 
Their testimony helped obtain convictions.

PHOTOGRAPHERS PLAN TRIP

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of Santa Monica College's photography department plan to share their 
technical know-how with the Soviet Union during a series of seminars and 
lectures in Lithuania later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica delegation will also deliver 90 color and black-and-white 
photographs taken by school faculty members. The collection will be displayed 
at galleries throughout Lithuania before being donated to the University of 
Vilnius in Lithuania's capital. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which leaves for Lithuania on May 26, includes three 
photography instructors and a graphics arts faculty member. They were invited 
by Lithuania's Photographic Union after an exhibit last year at Santa Monica 
College by Lithuanian photographer Rimantas Dichavicius. 
</P>
<P>
College officials said the Lithuanians expressed particular interest in 
commercial photography, after the recent, unprecedented publication of 
advertisements in a Soviet government newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The seminars, which will be conducted at the University of Vilnius, will 
include instruction on fine art photography, on computer use for design and 
graphics, and on trends in U.S. photography.

Forty Los Feliz residents stood on a stage at Marshall High School last week to 
receive diplomas. They wore fluorescent green vests and hard hats and carried 
gray flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
When the Big One comes, they'll be the ones to look for. 
</P>
<P>
They are the core of the civil defense team the Los Angeles Fire Department 
hopes will rise to care for Los Feliz neighborhoods when the destruction 
overwhelms the city's resources. 
</P>
<P>
They'll be on the streets and easy to spot, partly because of the outfits but 
also because they'll be the ones who know what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
For seven weeks, they've assembled each Wednesday night for 2 1/2 hours of 
tutoring by the Fire Department's Community Response Team Unit. Twelve such 
teams are being trained every seven weeks, throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
They study fire extinguishers, first aid, communications, maps, search and 
rescue and logistics. They also study that most elusive of subjects, command. 
</P>
<P>
When the time comes, they're expected to become leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them already are. Among the Los Feliz group were a Vietnam vet, the 
president of the Los Feliz Improvement Assn. and the housewife who organized 
the campaign to save Marshall's Gothic architecture more then 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But there were also retirees, teen-agers and others whose main focus in life 
has been the duties of student, parent or employee. There's no way to know 
ahead of time which ones will have to take control in a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
In their final lesson last week, they got a mild preview of what could happen. 
Capt. William M. Cody of the department's disaster preparedness division broke 
the class into four groups and sent them different ways. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, Group 2, you will have the dubious honor of being the victims first," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cody assigned each victim symptoms and spotted them around the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hysterical and in shock," said one woman who lay with her legs on the 
stage steps and her head on the floor. The woman beside her was simply dead. 
</P>
<P>
Cody then briefed the search and rescue group in the hall. The plan was to find 
and count all victims, put a tag on each identifying injuries, mobilize the 
able-bodied and perform first aid on those whose lives were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
The group fanned out in the darkened room using flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed a simple exercise. But there was confusion. Some victims were counted 
twice by different searchers. Some searchers gave too much attention to the 
first victim they found, forgetting that their duty was to determine the number 
and extent of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, one commented on how overwhelming it had been to encounter a mere 10 
victims. Cody warned that the greatest threat to their success would be the 
urge to focus on a single task. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the hall, firefighter Thomas Guzman took another group through a 
fire suppression drill. 
</P>
<P>
Heading down the hall toward an imaginary fire, he stopped them at a door on 
which he had placed a hazardous-chemical sign. 
</P>
<P>
"What does this tell you?" Guzman asked. "Danger. To me, it's a stop sign. Keep 
the door closed. Don't go in and investigate the fire." 
</P>
<P>
"What if there are people known to be trapped there?" one of the group asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That will be your decision as a team," Guzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions were piling up quickly in the command post on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't set up a command post after an earthquake, you're going to have 
nothing but chaos," junior firefighter Gilbert Urrea told his group. "A lot of 
energy and trained people, nothing done in concert." 
</P>
<P>
Urrea began reading messages representing news brought by returning runners. 
</P>
<P>
"Message No. 4, library," he said. "We have a collapsed building, Waverly and 
Edgewater, northeast corner." 
</P>
<P>
The communications leader logged the message in blue ink, indicating search and 
rescue, and passed a memo to the search and rescue leader who dispatched a 
group. 
</P>
<P>
As messages came in, groups were split up and sent in different directions, 
their tasks marked on a map. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 20 injured at Edgewater and Rowena," Urrea said. 
</P>
<P>
Urrea questioned the decision to send only part of a six-member group. 
</P>
<P>
"As group leader, you feel that four people might be overwhelmed by 20 
injuries," he advised. "Go with entire group." 
</P>
<P>
The command post members sensed a shortage of people. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you correct that?" Urrea asked. "Call logistics and ask for runners." 
</P>
<P>
They wondered where the new people would come from. 
</P>
<P>
"Word of mouth is going to travel very quickly that at the corner of Ivanhoe 
and Edgewater there is help," Urrea said. 
</P>
<P>
It was evident that not everyone felt comfortable with command. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason people will follow you and submit to your authority is that you 
know what you're doing," Urrea assured them. 
</P>
<P>
Edgewater and Ivanhoe was an imaginary command post, by the way. In a real 
disaster, the people who know what they're doing will go to Michael's on Los 
Feliz Boulevard.

EX-OXNARD COLLEGE CHIEF APPOINTED TO RUN MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Robings, who retired last year as president of Oxnard College, has been 
appointed executive director of the Ventura County Museum of Art and History. 
</P>
<P>
He announced this week that he will resign as director of Oxnard's World Trade 
Center, which promotes international trade in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"There is hardly anything I would have left the Trade Center for," said 
Robings, 60, "and the Ventura County Museum of Art and History is one of those 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Robings will fill the post vacated last August when Keith Foster resigned to 
become director of the Redding Museum and Art Center. The Ventura museum's 
acting director, Frances Johnson-Pietro, will return to her job as curator of 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials said they were impressed with the credentials of Robings, a 
gregarious man with a booming voice who retired from Oxnard College after seven 
years as president. 
</P>
<P>
He has been president of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce and has been active in 
community organizations and events ranging from United Way to the Strawberry 
Festival. In November, he unsuccessfully ran for the Oxnard City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"He has managerial skills," said Dorcas H. Thille, museum board president. "And 
we felt we needed a manager." 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials hope that Robings, who begins work May 15, will increase 
Oxnard's participation in the museum, which is more closely associated with 
Ventura city history than with other county areas. "In fact, it's a countywide 
museum," Thille said. 
</P>
<P>
The Trade Center's board of directors plans to meet tomorrow to discuss 
replacing Robings, said Nao Takasugi, center president and Oxnard mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Robings has been on the executive board of the Ventura County Museum of History 
and Art since October. His wife Joan has served as a museum docent since 1981.

WEST COVINA REMAINS IN LIMBO ON PUBLIC WORKS BACKLOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WEST COVINA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pleas to "bite the bullet" and stop waffling, the City Council 
postponed a decision on how to fund a $34-million backlog in public works 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting on Monday, the City Council backed away from deciding on 
any action, which could include imposing new taxes. The council's only decisive 
action was to direct city staff to avoid any decrease in existing services. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, the city has been considering a proposal to institute a 
politically unpleasant utility tax or a special assessment district to foot the 
bill for improvements ranging from street repairs to storm drain work. The 
proposal was made by a 25-member citizens committee, which assessed the city's 
capital needs and the means of meeting them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little Shocked' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little shocked by the shortsightedness," committee member Tom Lorincz 
told the council in criticizing its discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did the committee sit there for 18 months?" he asked in an interview. The 
council is "not going to find anything we didn't look at." 
</P>
<P>
Either of the committee's funding alteratives would have to be approved by 
residents. The utility tax would need a majority vote, and the assessment 
district would require two-thirds approval. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert L. Bacon said he agrees with the committee's conclusion, but added 
that the prospect of a new tax or assessment district succeeding at the polls 
is nil without strong support from council members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unanimous Support Needed 
</P>
<P>
"The other council members were apparently afraid of proceeding," Bacon said. 
"Without unanimous council support, it will divide the vote so much it won't 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
Bacon predicted that the council will continue to grapple with the issue until 
a majority comes to the same conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William Tarozzi, who advocated cutting the city budget to pay for a 
reduced amount of capital repairs, predicted that a utility tax would never be 
approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
In a voluminous report, the citizens committee recommended levying a 3 1/4% tax 
on the estimated $97 million in annual sales of electricity, natural gas, 
telephone service and cable television subscriptions. At that rate, the tax 
would raise $3.17 million annually over its proposed 15-year life, according to 
the committee report. The estimated weekly household cost would be $5. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment district was the committee's secondary recommendation because of 
limits on its use and the two-thirds approval needed at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
In a presentation to the council, City Manager Herman R. Fast compared the 
city's financial situation to that of several surrounding communities of 
similar size. The conclusion, according to Fast's staff, was that West Covina 
is an efficient city, saddled with a small tax base and a large proportion of 
residential development. 
</P>
<P>
For example, West Covina has 43.9 staff members per 10,000 residents; Covina, a 
city half the size, has 44.9 and Pomona, which is slightly larger, has 61.9, 
Fast said. 
</P>
<P>
Fast recommended that the council pursue either the utility tax or the 
assessment district, and that the city resist making budgetary cuts, which he 
said would erode the quality of life for West Covina residents. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon said it was unrealistic to think that the city can accomplish the repairs 
without finding a new revenue source. "I don't think there's a lot of fat in 
the budget; we're a well-run city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lean and Mean' Budget 
</P>
<P>
Although saying that the city budget was already "lean and mean," Councilwoman 
Nancy Manners advocated cutting back on council stipends and other minor 
expenditures before "we ask (the public) to approve something that we don't 
even agree on." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Lewis proposed that service not be cut to fund the capital 
improvements. Tarozzi was the only council member to vote against the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Tarozzi suggested paring back or postponing some of the capital repairs and 
instituting either a one-year salary freeze or laying off 5% of the 430 
municipal employees. Tarozzi's proposal would have spared the Police and Fire 
departments and included a 10% cut in operating materials and services. 
</P>
<P>
A wage freeze, however, would violate a three-year agreement the city recently 
entered with most of its staff and could not happen immediately or without an 
unlikely concession from employees. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon criticized "Tarozzi's voodoo economics," but said "until he either backs 
off or comes to the realization that we cannot possibly fund these items 
without some new source of revenues, we're not going to get (a new tax) passed, 
and there's no need to put it on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Brad McFadden proposed that each department's budget be cut by 10%, 
which he said could be implemented through layoffs or operational decreases. He 
also demanded that developers of the proposed expansion of the Fashion Plaza 
shopping center give the city $23 million in expected profits to help pay for 
the improvements.

'PATERNALISTIC' LETTER SPURS REPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take exception to Jesse L. Robinson's paternalistic attitude to the Latino 
community ("No 'Guarantees' in Council Election," Times, April 13). I have 
lived in Compton for over 30 years and have seen its transformation from white 
to black. Now a huge furor -- and "blacklash" -- is developing over Latinos 
wanting a piece of the sweet potato pie. Robinson says that "(City Council 
candidate) Martin D. Chavez's master's degree is not a prerequisite for 
election to the Compton City Council." Let me tell you, it's a better 
alternative than ignorance. I am not for any one color whether it be black, 
brown, red, yellow or puce. I am, however, against ignorance and race-baiting. 
</P>
<P>
One of the incumbent candidates was heard to say that if they (Latinos) don't 
like it here, they should go elsewhere. In the '60s, conservative (read: 
incumbent, ensconced, don't bug me) America told those who wanted to change 
America for the better -- "America: love it or leave it." But now it's become, 
"Compton: love it or leave it." And, I guess, the proper response would be: 
"Compton: change it or lose it." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson labels as "crazy" the projected 38.8% Latino population figure from 
the National Planning Data Corp. because he does not know where the housing 
would come from. Robinson is definitely no authority on housing. Whites sold 
out to the blacks, and blacks are selling out to the Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
I know Chavez as a competent young professional who would infuse the Compton 
City Council with a spirit of honesty, decency and respect for good, clean hard 
work. I have seen Compton used and abused time and again. Robinson says 
"Compton has paid for (Councilman Robert L.) Adams' education." And how! The 
city is still paying for it -- through the nose. How much did the city (read: 
local taxpayers) lose on the Compton Auto Plaza? How much did the city sink 
into the Compton Lazben Hotel and it still hasn't had one paying guest? 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, and other rising Latino stars like him, may not now have the votes or 
money, but they will. Just give them time. 
</P>
<P>
It's plain to see that Robinson does not have a handle on the numbers, nor 
quality, of the city and school district employees, since he said he "hopes" 
that the city of Compton and the Compton Unified School District are hiring the 
most qualified people regardless of race, creed or color. If the city and 
school district were hiring the best qualified employees it would stand to 
reason that the city of Compton would be the best-run city in America, and the 
school district would have test scores and student achievement that would rank 
it as No. 1. This, however, is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
I know some people are uneasy because of the increasing number of Latinos in 
the city, but in the '50s, whites were uneasy about the blacks coming into the 
city, too. I know, also, that those in power (city and school district) don't 
like people to make waves. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and others like him must realize that the only constant in life is 
change, and the sooner the powers-that-be in the city and school district begin 
incorporating Latinos into their future design, the better city government and 
the schools will serve their customers -- the people who reside here and the 
students who attend the schools even if they speak black English with a Spanish 
accent.

FIREMAN ABANDONS LABOR LEADERS, TRIES TO NEGOTIATE AS 1-MAN UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past 16 months, veteran Ventura County firefighter Ron Relyea has 
sought to create an oxymoron: a one-man union. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by what he considers ineffective representation by the Ventura County 
Professional Firefighters Assn., Relyea notified officials last year that he 
wanted to represent himself -- something no other county employee had ever 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
Relyea's effort is seen by the county as a challenge that would disrupt 
collective bargaining. And even though the Ventura County Civil Service 
Commission has ruled that state law endorses his quest, county officials have 
yet to sit down with him at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start fighting the entrenched bureaucracy, it's like punching 
Jell-O," said Relyea, 50, of Simi Valley. "The more you win, the more you 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Relyea is by no means anti-union. During his 25 years of fighting fires, he 
served as union president for three years and sat on the firefighter union's 
board of directors for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"When one of the guys got in trouble, whether you agreed with him or not wasn't 
important," he said. "The important thing was that he paid his dues and when he 
needed representation, he got it." 
</P>
<P>
Relyea said the union has not lived up to that promise in the past four years. 
Deals have been cut and union members have been shut out, he said. And the 
results of several votes on important union matters have been kept secret, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry Mr. Relyea feels that way," said Mark Sanchez, a vice president of 
the firefighters union. "We're talking about one person out of a membership 
that is more than 350 strong. I don't see a movement of people dropping out of 
the union." 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, Relyea let county officials know that he was no longer a 
member of the union and would be bargaining for himself. Last fall, he filed a 
contract proposal that addressed such safety issues as diesel fumes circulating 
in firehouse living quarters, how often new safety garb must be issued and when 
firefighters must be fed while fighting a stubborn fire. But he said he got no 
response. 
</P>
<P>
Relyea filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Civil Service Commission 
in December because the county had not negotiated with him. And in March, the 
commission ruled 3 to 0 in his favor. The commission recommendation was sent to 
the County Board of Supervisors on April 11, and personnel officials are 
considering whether to comply. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little-Used Section of Law 
</P>
<P>
Ray Charles, the Civil Service Commission's staff representative, said a 
little-used section of the 1969 state law governing the relationship between 
public agencies and their employees allows individuals the same rights to 
negotiate a contract as unions. 
</P>
<P>
All Relyea wanted to do was represent himself, Charles said. "He was furious to 
think they could violate the law just by ignoring him." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Charles acknowledged, if every employee sought to fully exercise the 
right to negotiate for himself, it "could really play havoc with the system." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hammitt, executive director of the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura 
County, which represents 6,500 workers, disagreed with the commission's 
interpretation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Hammitt said the clause on which the commission based its decision ensures that 
extremely small employee groups -- for instance, the single gravedigger in a 
small town -- are allowed to negotiate with their employer even if not 
represented by a union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dumb, and I think the Civil Service Commission blew it on that one," 
Hammitt said. Besides, "a person who represents himself has a fool for a 
client." 
</P>
<P>
Ed McLean, the county's chief labor negotiator, said his staff has not decided 
how to respond to the Civil Service Commission's recommendation. In addition to 
raising numerous technical and procedural problems, McLean said, Relyea's 
request also turns the notion of collective bargaining on its head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Step Backward' 
</P>
<P>
"Individuals who felt that they lacked the clout individually to effectively 
bargain joined together . . . to collectively bargain," McLean said. What 
Relyea wants "would seem to be a significant step backward." 
</P>
<P>
But Relyea's fellow firefighters do not all agree that what he wants is a step 
backward. To some of them, he's a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot like me who admire Ron for what he's doing," said a 
fellow firefighter of Simi Valley's Battalion 45. "He's got the guts and the 
tenacity to do it. There's a lot of us behind him." 
</P>
<P>
The support of other firefighters, Relyea said, has been encouraging. 
"Everybody would like to beat city hall once in a while," he said.

OVERHAUL OF GAMBLING LAW SHELVED A YEAR

Senate hearings on a bill that would overhaul the state's century-old gambling 
law have been postponed for one year because of continuing disputes between law 
enforcement officials and operators of seven Southland card clubs. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) confirmed this week 
that any action on the bill, which is in the Senate Governmental Organizational 
Committee, has been cancelled. A hearing had been tentatively scheduled for 
Tuesday, Beverly aide Josh Pane said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to hold it over for next year," Pane said in a telephone 
interview. "The opponents just couldn't get it together." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the bill, which was drafted by lawyers for a coalition of Southland 
city managers, appeared destined for passage, Bell Gardens City Manager Claude 
Booker said. But a dispute over the legality of playing jackpot poker has since 
threatened its passage, he said.

Officials of the California Peace Officers Assn. contend that card club 
operators violate the state Lottery law by offering jackpots, which can be as 
high as $70,000. Jackpots are offered at the seven card clubs in Bell, Bell 
Gardens, Huntington Park, Commerce and Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento lobbyist Joseph Gonzalvez, who represents the city manager 
coalition, said that Beverly has asked a legislative counsel to study the 
5-year-old Lottery law and decide whether jackpot poker violates its 
provisions. A decision, he said, could come within a month. JAMES M. GOMEZ

OCCIDENTAL'S SIBLING REVELRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Bonetto's dormitory room door was decorated for part of last year with a 
collection of newspaper articles that chronicled the baseball accolades of a 
high school athlete. 
</P>
<P>
No egocentric urge inspired the collage. Tom had no yearning to leave 
Occidental College and relive his glory days at Big Bear High, yet there were 
the clippings: 
</P>
<P>
 Bonetto Strikes Out 18. Bonetto Drafted in the 56th Round by the Cleveland 
Indians. Bonetto This. Bonetto That. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonetto, yes. Tom, no. The subject of the clippings was his younger brother, 
Mike. 
</P>
<P>
And Mike's accomplishments were worthy of display. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear High has an enrollment of 600 students and competes in athletics at 
the Southern Section 1-A Division level. Still Mike, who played quarterback on 
the football team and pitched for the baseball team, received scholarship 
offers from Pepperdine, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State. Professional 
baseball scouts also took note of the way Mike, a left-hander, gunned his 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
But last summer, Mike threw everybody a curve. Instead of pursuing a career in 
the Indians organization or accepting a Division I scholarship, he decided to 
attend Occidental, a Division III school with just 1,600 students. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, a junior who has started at second base since his freshman year, wasn't 
going to argue. Nor was his father, himself an Occidental graduate who was a 
two-time all-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference baseball 
selection and an assistant coach at Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
Mike cites the fact that both his parents attended Occidental -- and his desire 
to play both baseball and football -- as his reasons for choosing the college. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a point that I would never look back on anything," Mike said. "When I 
make a decision, I go for it." 
</P>
<P>
Mike has temporarily tired of pitching and has switched his focus to hitting. 
He is the Tigers' designated-hitter and, on occasion, plays first base. With 
three games to play in the regular season, he has 10 home runs -- one off the 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
Mike could break the record this weekend when the Tigers finish up against 
Caltech, a school which has traditionally had more students with high 
grade-point averages than low earned-run averages. But the Caltech pitchers 
figure to be smart, which means Bonetto isn't likely to get anything good to 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's getting walked so much now it's incredible," Occidental Coach Jeff 
Henderson said of Mike, who was walked five times against Redlands last 
weekend. He leads the team with 33 walks. 
</P>
<P>
It must be unnerving for pitchers to see Bonetto's 6-foot-2, 190-pound frame 
hunkering over the plate waiting. At 6 feet and 165 pounds, Tom is far less 
imposing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was such a small kid," Tom said. "I was in junior high and he was in 
elementary school and we were the same size. He's never really been a little 
brother to begin with because he's so big." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tom, a right-hander, has been even more prolific than Mike at the plate. 
He is batting a team-high .432 and moved into third on the school's all-time 
single-season hit list with 54. The record is 65, but second place is just a 
hit away. 
</P>
<P>
Mike's presence might have played a role in Tom's offensive upswing this 
season. Though Tom, a team captain, has always been a valuable defensive 
player, he has traditionally had difficulty with his bat speed. Last season, he 
hit .288. 
</P>
<P>
In rough times, hitting can be a sore subject between the Bonettos, who 
nonetheless agree they are best friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually don't talk to Michael during a ballgame," Tom said. "After a bad 
outing at the plate, where I would notice a mechanical problem in his swing, I 
would tell him, 'Keep your weight back and be more aggressive,' and he would 
jump all over me. That's the last thing he wants to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Tom can hardly criticize his brother's aggressiveness on the football field, 
however. Mike might be better at belting players than smacking baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
At least Occidental football Coach Dale Widolff thinks so. Widolff noticed Mike 
last summer when the team went through a form-tackling drill that required each 
player to sprint downfield, avoid a blocker and tackle a ballcarrier. 
</P>
<P>
Mike excelled at the drill. 
</P>
<P>
"We had never thought of him as a defensive player," Widolff said. "He jumped 
out at us. The speed at which he could do it. And even thought he was a 
quarterback, the fact that he would jump right in there and put his nose right 
into the guy really impressed us. We thought maybe we were wasting him as 
(starting quarterback) Tony Werbelow's backup." 
</P>
<P>
Widolff suggested Mike move to defensive back and, within a week, he was a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that helps make Mike a great athlete is that he picks up a new 
physical skill very quickly," Widolff said. "The guy learns a skill as quickly 
as anybody I've ever been around. It's phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
Mike's athletic triumphs have come as no surprise to Tom . . . or those who 
read his door.

IRWINDALE AGAIN SUES DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST 
</P>

<P>
IRWINDALE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite some conciliatory talk by city officials last week, the city has filed 
another lawsuit against Fred Lyte, its former redevelopment consultant. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed in Pomona Superior Court, the city contends that Lyte 
"fraudulently (concealed) material facts about a development project . . . 
which otherwise would have been rejected" in order to collect an extra fee 
under his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also charged Lyte with trying to disrupt the city's negotiations with 
the Los Angeles Raiders to build a $150 million football stadium in Irwindale 
by spreading rumors and making false charges. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte, part of the negotiating team that produced the initial accord with the 
Raiders, characterized the suit this week as "pure baloney, tailored to harass 
me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Blocks Payments 
</P>
<P>
Since the City Council dismissed the consultant last December, the city has 
widely accused him of creating discord in the city and blocked the payment of 
more than $1 million in bills he has submitted to Irwindale. The city has also 
filed a lawsuit seeking more than $2 million in damages, claiming that Lyte had 
violated a provision in his contract forbidding him to recommend to the city 
projects in which he had a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
In a bitter exchange with city officials last month, Lyte charged the first 
suit "will be laughed out of court" because he was never a city employee. The 
laws that define conflicts of interest may not apply to him, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte, who has called for an investigation of Mayor Patricio Miranda by the Los 
Angeles County district attorney, charged that, since Miranda became the mayor 
last year, the city has been "turned over to" a group of lawyers and 
consultants who are concerned only about personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Martin, who serves as city manager and city attorney, suggested at last 
week's City Council meeting that the city would be willing to reach an 
out-of-court settlement with Lyte, if the fired consultant would be 
"reasonable" in his dealings with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The new legal action centers on the creation of a strip mall two years ago at 
the intersection of Irwindale Avenue and Arrow Highway, a block from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint against Lyte, the Hopkins Development Co. had agreed 
to build a shopping center on a two-acre lot on Arrow Highway, but only if an 
adjacent 7,000-square-foot lot at the southeast corner of the busy intersection 
could be included in the package. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller lot, with a 50-foot frontage on Irwindale Avenue, is owned by 
Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint against Lyte, Miranda had refused to lease the 
property to Hopkins because his constituents would perceive such an arrangement 
by a city official as a conflict of interest. Following the advice of Martin, 
Miranda "would not lease or sell his land to any party who would be involved in 
the shopping center development," the complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
But principals of Hopkins, the development company, three years ago formed a 
general partnership, and negotiated a lease with Miranda. The complaint says 
Miranda did not know that he was dealing with a Hopkins subsidiary, and Lyte 
withheld that information to collect a 3% fee for bringing a new development to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restaurant Property 
</P>
<P>
Miranda's property, once the site of Miranda's taco stand, called Pudgy's, now 
holds a Jack-in-the-Box outlet that shares a parking lot with a 10-store strip 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
"The city did not discover the true facts relating to Lyte's fraudulent 
concealment of information or breach of fiduciary duty until April, 1989," the 
complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte, who has accused Miranda of jeopardizing the Raiders deal and causing "a 
virtual halt in the (Irwindale) industrial development program," scoffed at the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he has seen copies of correspondence between Miranda and Hopkins 
in early 1987, discussing the mayor's lease with Irwindale Associates. "They're 
using city money to try to run me out of business, and that just isn't going to 
work," Lyte said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pudgy's property has also become an issue in a recall campaign initiated by 
some Irwindale residents against Miranda and Councilman Salvador Hernandez. 
According to a petition drawn up by resident Brenda Marin, Miranda tried to 
"extort additional rent for the Pudgy's property through use of governmental 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Miranda did not respond to telephone messages. Marin would not comment on her 
recall petition.

WHITTIER GYM ATTRACTS HARD-CORE LIFTERS WITH THEIR HARD ROCK MUSIC, SMELL OF 
SWEAT, LOOK OF STEROIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An intimidating aura, absent in plush health spas and fitness centers, suits 
the aspiring Arnold Schwarzeneggers who inhabit the Uptown Gym in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors that wrap around the gym's walls reflect no elaborate machines and 
beautiful people socializing, but ponderous barbells and drably dressed 
weightlifters grunting and grimacing their way to exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
The lifting is done to rock music -- as hard as the muscles on display. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the front door of this building -- which a decade ago held a light 
fixture store and before that, a bank -- is open, the smell of sweat does not 
dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
John Franco, 25, whose build bespeaks an addiction to weight training, ducked 
out the door for fresh air one morning last week. "The atmosphere here 
definitely sets us apart from the spas," he said. "And the equipment is old and 
practical." 
</P>
<P>
The gym gained notoriety recently when it was mentioned in Sports Illustrated 
as the workout spot of 315-pound Tony Mandarich, a Whittier resident and former 
Michigan State University lineman who was the second player selected in the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
"The Uptown is a bare-bones pit for serious metal junkies," the magazine 
reported in its story on Mandarich. "There is nothing here but bars, plates and 
primitive machines. Fly strips hang like stalactites from the dirty ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Gill, 48, the gym's co-owner, was not pleased with the description of the 
ceiling, which does not look dirty. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there had been a problem with flies: "Every year about this 
time they come in to get out of the wind. We did have some strips up over in 
that corner." 
</P>
<P>
Gill, who wore a white undershirt that revealed a weightlifter's body, said the 
magazine wanted to depict Mandarich as slaving in a sweat shop. Gill had no 
quarrel with that, but pointed out that the place is brighter and cleaner than 
any dungeon. 
</P>
<P>
The gym, fronted by plate-glass windows, is decorated with photos of flexing 
bodybuilders. Among them is Rory Leidelmeyer, an Uptown regular and former Mr. 
America who is Mandarich's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Tanning accelerators, protein powder drinks and a bottle (for $30) of Pro Super 
Juice, which helps produce testosterone -- a male hormone that enhances 
musculature -- are exhibited in a case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yearly Memberships 
</P>
<P>
"This is a typical hard-core gym," Gill said of the Uptown, which is similar to 
the famous Gold's Gym in Venice, offers memberships for $250 a year and has 
about 700 members. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not like a health spa dealing with Johnny Joe Average. These are 
hard-core lifters. The average guy doesn't want to take it this far. He wants 
to get rid of his pot belly and tune up, but he's not the type who wants to get 
18-inch arms or a 50-inch chest. And he doesn't care if he can't bench-press 
400 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
The bodies that are developed at the Uptown -- some enlarged further by 
steroids, according to Gill -- are thicker than the bodies at health spas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common knowledge that bodybuilders use steroids and that steroids are 
around gyms and that they are available in gyms," Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
He said steroids aren't sold at the Uptown because it's illegal, and because 
drug agents sometimes come around gyms. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) I know there are members here who sell them," he said. "I find needles 
lying around all the time. There was one up on one of the tanning beds the 
other day. Some of these guys are heavily into 'roids, some dabble in them and 
some don't touch them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Intimidated 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, the bodybuilders arrive, slapping their gym bags on the 
front counter and pulling out huge weightlifting belts. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are intimidated about coming in here," Gill said. "They see these 
big guys and are afraid they'll come in and be mistreated. Or have someone say 
how wimpy they are. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have the best bunch of guys. A lot of gyms are cliquish. We rarely have 
a fight. I've kicked out two guys in eight years." 
</P>
<P>
Women work out at the Uptown, too, though not in colorful spandex outfits and 
leg warmers. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see Heather Locklear or Cher here," said Jon Bailey, 39, who works 
behind the front desk. He was referring to the actresses who are often seen 
promoting health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
You do see Lisa Wernli, 24, of La Mirada. A Los Angeles police officer who 
trains for strength, she wore gray sweats and hoisted heavy weights with gloved 
hands. She described spas, which she avoids, as dating services. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody here trains hard," she said. "The people are knowledgeable." 
</P>
<P>
"We offer instruction," said Gill, who with partner Rick Weaver bought the gym 
seven years ago. "In health clubs there are mostly young kids working who don't 
know anything about weight training or anatomy." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Uptown has a mixed clientele consisting, Gill said, of people from 
all walks of life, there are popular jokes about bodybuilding gyms and the 
people who would rather hang out in them than do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, a former power lifter, is fond of saying: "I think there are two guys 
in here who have a job." Or, "We even had a guy in here who was a high school 
graduate." 
</P>
<P>
Gill said there is some truth to the gym-rat image: "All some of them want to 
do is pump iron; they work just enough to pay for supplements and other things 
they need. Their status is their size, not money." 
</P>
<P>
After straining through incline presses, squats, standing dumbbell shrugs and 
lateral pull-downs, the lifters check the mirror, viewing through hopeful eyes 
their biceps, triceps, deltoids, quads and other muscles shown in the 
anatomical chart on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Amused by their insecurity, Gill said, "They're always saying, 'Do I look 
good?' 'Do I look a little smaller today?' 'Is he bigger than me?' " 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the room there was much clanking of metal and gritting of teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon, man! Go! That's it, push!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One More Repetition 
</P>
<P>
Eric Lopez was encouraging his workout partner, Bob Earlywine, to grind out one 
more repetition. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 21, a computer college student, has a massive chest and 17-inch arms 
that overshadow his 5-foot-5 height. Gill said he remembered when Lopez was 
skinny. 
</P>
<P>
Earlywine, older than most of the lifters at 32, is a deputy with the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. He rarely misses a day at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm into health and nutrition," Earlywine said. "I don't put the mass on like 
they (steroid users) do, but I'm healthier." 
</P>
<P>
And Lopez maintained: "I don't believe in steroids; I don't take any drugs, 
just good supplements." 
</P>
<P>
Gill said that many of the lifters want to be like Schwarzenegger, but added, 
"A lot of guys have the little-man complex; they want to be bigger." He noted 
that the average bodybuilder is 5-foot-6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Always Wears a Hat 
</P>
<P>
Strong and tall. Mike Zendejas of Montebello, a veteran of bodybuilding shows, 
was doing squats. His outfit included a gray sweat shirt and an old hat. "My 
uniform," he said. "You never see me in anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Of steroids he said, "If you're doing it just (to look good) for the summer, 
you're an idiot. But if you're going to make a career out of this, as long as 
you know the risks, go for it. If you're not willing to die for the sport, you 
have no business sticking a syringe in your ass. I'm willing to endanger my 
health to get what I want. I'm only 21 and willing to face the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Gill said he knows another lifter who uses steroids "to the point that it 
scares me -- but that's his business. Young people think they're going to live 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief break, Zendejas went back to the weights. He would soon end his 
afternoon workout, but probably would return early in the evening. They all 
come back then, crowding the place with their bodies and energy. The noise will 
be deafening. 
</P>
<P>
And out on Philadelphia Street, passers-by will look in cautiously and see not 
a gym but a zoo.

STRING OF CONFERENCE TRACK TITLES ENDS FOR GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although its string of 14 consecutive league titles came to an end, the 
Glendale College men's track and field team made a strong showing in the 
Western State Conference championships Friday at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros, who were 9-0 in WSC meets, placed third in the conference finals 
and fell victim to a rule implemented this season in which the conference 
champion is determined solely on the outcome of the WSC finals. In years past, 
a team's regular-season performance in dual meets was taken into account. 
Glendale would have shared first with Bakersfield and Moorpark in that format. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, 10 men and seven women from Glendale qualified for the Southern 
California preliminaries at Cerritos College on Saturday. The finals will be 
held May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Beck, who was named the top men's athlete in the meet, qualified in four 
events. Beck won the 400-meter hurdles in a personal-record 53.46 seconds and 
the long jump with a leap of 23 feet, 9 inches, also a personal record. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Barnett set a school and meet record in the javelin with a throw of 
207-6. 
</P>
<P>
Other qualifiers included John Szekely, who placed second in shotput at 49-0, 
and Steve Graham, fourth in the 1,500 in 4:03.59, a personal record. John 
Kearney posted a career best with a 4:03.61 finish in the 1,500 and Fernando 
Diaz notched a personal record with a fifth-place finish (15:30.62) in the 
5,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the women, Marji Gilles qualified for the Southern California meet in six 
events: triple jump (37-7 1/4), javelin (111-2), high jump (5-2), long jump 
(16-11 3/4), shotput (33-1) and as a member of the 4 x 100 relay (53.24). The 
relay team, which finished fourth, included Daniella Gogh, Bianca Howard, 
Gilles and Margarita Red-Horse. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Myers qualified in the javelin with at 129-3, the discus (122-0), the 
shotput (34-11) and the triple jump (33-1 3/4). 
</P>
<P>
Linda Benioff qualified in the shotput (39-4) and discus (114-7), Howard 
finished second in the high jump (5-4) and Gogh placed fourth in the 100 
hurdles (17.09). 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, at Bakersfield, three Glendale runners qualified in the men's 
10,000 meters. Graham finished second in 32:23, Kearney placed third in 32:58 
and Diaz finished fifth (33:16). In the hammer throw, Jeff Levy finished second 
with with an effort of 122-2. 
</P>
<P>
He's waiting for the movie: Glendale High shortstop Swain Wukelich found that 
when he starts checking his statistics, he inevitably falls into a slump. He 
prefers the one-day-at-a-time approach in which each at-bat is a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
So when teammates bust out the stat book, Wukelich usually scoots. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, take a peek recently. And, well, ouch. 
</P>
<P>
"He checked out his average and almost dropped on the floor," Coach Chris 
Axelgard said. "He's hitting about .105. He's batting less than he weighs." 
</P>
<P>
Wukelich batted .330 last season.

A DAY TO REMEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Tuesday, a group of people gathered at the Pasadena City Hall to remember 
the victims and survivors of Holocaust. Following are excerpts of two speeches 
made at the Day of Remembrance ceremony, which was sponsored by the Pasadena 
Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
John Weidner of Monterey Park was a leader of the Dutch Underground, which 
helped hundreds of Jews escape to neutral countries during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I was born in Holland, the grandson of a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church 
and the son of a minister of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
</P>
<P>
During my father's lifetime, he taught me, my family, his parishioners and the 
community that the most important quality in a human being was to love, respect 
and treat our fellow man as we wished to be loved, respected and treated. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he teach this lesson, my father lived it as well. When the Nazi 
Holocaust swept Europe, my father protested the inhumane treatment of the Jews 
by the Nazis. For this, he was placed in prison. 
</P>
<P>
My sister Gabrielle protested the cruel action of the Nazis against the Jews. 
For this, Gabrielle was placed in the Ravensbrueck concentration camp. There, 
she died one day after the liberation of the camp by the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
I was a witness to the barbaric treatment of the Jews by the Nazis. I 
personally observed the crushing of the skull of a Jewish infant who was torn 
out of the arms of its mother. 
</P>
<P>
I was determined to heed the teachings and example of my father and I did 
everything that I could to save as many lives as possible. 
</P>
<P>
As I have reflected on the Nazi Holocaust, I have come to realize that many of 
the Germans and other Europeans that led and participated in this genocide 
against the Jews were seeking scapegoats for their problems rather than taking 
the responsibility of solving the historical, social and economic problems of 
life with intelligence and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson that I have learned as an active participant in the struggle against 
the Nazis is that each of us, be he Christian or Jew, has the responsibility to 
honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust. We need to teach our children 
that life is beset with problems that must be faced courageously, honestly with 
intelligence and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
We must teach the younger generation that we are all God's children and are in 
the hands of a loving God. We need to honor and treat each other so as to bring 
respect upon ourselves in the eyes of God and in the hearts and minds of all 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abe Cheslow of Pasadena was one of the first soldiers to liberate survivors of 
the Dachau Concentration Camp in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It is important that there be a constant reminder that there was a Holocaust 
and that it must never be allowed to be repeated. If more mayors, boards of 
directors and legislators on every level acted as did ours, it would go a long 
way to ensure that it would not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
When I was asked to take part in this ceremony, I thought that it was not my 
place. A survivor, or a member of a survivor's family should stand here and 
relate the horrors and the stupidity that engulfed Europe in the 1930s and 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
But then I realized that the remembrance of the Holocaust is not the private 
domain of the victims. The horror of what happened 40 or 50 years ago touches 
us all, whether we came from Krakow or from Kansas . . . whether we lived 
through it, or were not yet born, or whether we believe in the Old Testament or 
follow the New. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In early 1945, I was a 20-year-old corporal in the U.S. Army, . . . part of the 
20th Tank Battalion of the 20th Armored Division, fighting our way through 
southern Germany and Bavaria. As we approached Munich, our orders were to take 
the city and continue into Austria. . . . We were not given much information as 
to what we would find. We were, therefore, totally unprepared for what we 
encountered when we went through a quaint, picturesque and neat town in 
Bavaria, and continued down the road to the abomination called Dachau. 
</P>
<P>
Dachau was a collection of buildings, visible from the road, set in the pines, 
and could have been a college campus. But, as my tank approached and entered 
the compound, not even . . . viewing the scene through a periscope could shield 
me from the enormity of what I saw, and the horror of the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Even though I was used to viewing violent and ugly death in combat, this was a 
hundred times worse. The buildings were littered with corpses. The bodies were 
stacked in piles and were lying in random collections on the ground. There were 
some 40 cattle cars on the railroad siding with bodies. And, worst of all, 
these bodies, clothed and unclothed, had match sticks for arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the living who lay there without animation, without emotion 
and very close to death. Their eyes, bulging from their gaunt faces, followed 
us as we moved around the camp, and we, the liberators, felt a deep sense of 
shame that we were so healthy, so well-fed and so alive. 
</P>
<P>
I saw hardened battle veterans who thought that it was unmanly to show emotion 
-- who were stoic and controlled when they lost friends in combat -- get down, 
gather a survivor in their arms, and cry unashamedly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Of all of God's creatures, only man makes war on its own kind, and to that, let 
me add only man is capable of great cruelty and inhumanity against one of his 
same species. 
</P>
<P>
We know that these people were murdered for no good reason. We cannot permit 
society to forget or deny their deaths, for then they would have died for no 
good reason. It is time for us to remember and time to tell our children and 
hope that they will tell their children. Only then can we feel sure that 
mankind will be vigilant to prevent it from happening again.

DAUGHTER OF WORLD-CLASS TRIPLE JUMPER JUST LIKE DAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was less than four years ago when Charles Yendork realized that daughter 
Juliana might have a future in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
A former world-class triple jumper for Ghana, Yendork had been practicing his 
specialty when his daughter approached him hoping to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
To his surprise, the 13-year-old leaped 34 feet -- competitive even for high 
school standards. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year she was surpassing 40 feet in the triple jump and 19 feet in the 
long jump. At 14 she established an age-group record of 40-3 in winning the 
triple jump in the Junior Olympics at Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
She has been steadily progressing since. 
</P>
<P>
As a 16-year-old sophomore at Walnut High, Yendork has been opening eyes with 
her performances. 
</P>
<P>
In a dual meet against Covina last week, the 5-11 Yendork uncorked a 41-4 1/2, 
best in the state this season and No. 7 in the world, according to Track and 
Field News. 
</P>
<P>
She has been nearly as impressive in the long jump, soaring to a state best of 
19-6 1/2 against the wind in the Valle Vista League preliminaries Monday at 
Azusa Pacific University. That is only three-fourths of an inch off the 
national best -- a distance she hopes to surpass today in the league finals at 
Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork has succeeded despite having never faced a lot of competition. 
</P>
<P>
She had competed as a freshman at University High in Waco, Tex., but her father 
did not feel she was receiving enough competition in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted him to leave his job as men's and women's track coach at Paul 
Quinn College in Waco and move to California. He is a part-time assistant for 
Walnut this season and is searching for a full-time position. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard about how competitive it is here, but we haven't really gotten much 
competition yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that when she gets to the CIF meets she gets the competition." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have good competition to get better because sometimes you can't 
push yourself," Juliana said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she says she has not watched a lot of track in California since she 
arrived in January, Yendork thinks the competition will be more challenging as 
the state meet approaches in June. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork said she has received considerably more competition in two other 
events, the 200- and 400-meter dashes. She has produced bests of 25.0 seconds 
in the 200 and 58.2 in the 400, among the top times in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the sprinting competition is a lot better here than in Texas, but the 
jumping for me is about the same," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her father thinks she has the ability to run the 200 in 23 and the 400 in 53. 
</P>
<P>
"She can be a real true sprinter and a real true jumper," he said. "She was 
breaking (age-group) records at 14 and 15. But we haven't really concentrated 
on the sprints. We've emphasized the triple jump and the long jump and she's 
done well." 
</P>
<P>
If she receives competition in the jumps, her father said there is no telling 
how much she can improve. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks she has the ability to go 43 or 44 feet in the triple jump by the 
state meet if she refines a new technique she has been attempting to perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"She used to use a double-arm (technique) in the triple jump and now she's 
using a single arm," he said. "That's the technique the best jumpers in the 
world use. Right now she should be jumping 44 or 45 feet. Once she's able to 
master the single-arm, she can go 43 or 44 easily." 
</P>
<P>
She said she leaped about 43 feet in the Arcadia Invitational meet in April, 
only to foul on the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Her father said she has had a few problems fouling recently but he has been 
impressed with her performance overall. 
</P>
<P>
"She's only 16 years old and you don't see girls 16 jumping 41 feet in the 
triple jump," he said. "She's going up mostly against juniors and seniors, and 
she's beating them." 
</P>
<P>
As for the long jump, he thinks she has a chance to surpass the 20-foot barrier 
today in the league finals. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now her potential is 21 easily this year," he said. "But she can jump 22 
if she gets good competition." 
</P>
<P>
Juliana's emergence as a prep track star in Southern California may have taken 
a few people by surprise, but her father is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really surprised because, from working with her at a young age, we 
knew she had talent and she's also a good athlete," he said. "She's a good 
basketball and tennis player." 
</P>
<P>
It also doesn't hurt to come from a strong family athletic background. 
</P>
<P>
Her father was one of the top triple jumpers in the world in the mid-1970s with 
a best of 56-7 heading into the 1976 Summer Olympics at Montreal. "That 
would've been good enough to win the gold medal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that was also the year African nations boycotted the Olympics in 
opposition to apartheid in South Africa. So, instead of competing for Ghana, he 
wound up watching the Olympics from the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a painful experience," he recalled. "We understood the politics 
involved, but we had trained so hard to get there." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, whom he has since divorced, was a top sprinter and jumper for Ghana 
and still lives in that West African nation. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the 1976 Olympics, he left Ghana and settled in Houston. He was 
an assistant coach at Texas Southern University and at a community college in 
Houston for about 10 years before becoming coach at Paul Quinn, a small college 
in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics, about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Juliana was born in Bolgatanga, Ghana, and went to Houston when she was 6 years 
old. She says she does not remember a lot about her life in Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork and her father expect to become U.S. citizens before the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Juliana competed for Ghana in the triple jump in the 1988 Summer Olympics in 
Seoul. She had just turned 16 and was one of the youngest competitors in the 
Olympics, and she admits she did not have one of her best performances. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather got real cold and then it got real hot," she said. "I didn't do 
real good and I didn't make the finals. But it was a great learning experience. 
That was my first time competing at that high of a level. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching them and seeing how they do it and learning from my mistakes, I know 
it's given me a lot of confidence to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Yendork has set a long-term goal of winning a gold medal for the U.S. in the 
1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. But her father said she will get a taste of 
international competition long before 1992. 
</P>
<P>
She has a long list of track meets in which she is scheduled to compete after 
the CIF state meet June 2 and 3 at Cerritos College in Norwalk. First there is 
the Junior Nationals on June 9 and 10 at Ohio State University and the TAC 
National Championships on June 15-17 in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
After that she will compete in international meets in Sweden, Finland, West 
Germany and England. She is also hoping to compete in the World Cup track 
championships in September at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
She has a lot plans, but Yendork does not want to get caught looking too far 
into the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still only a sophomore and I have three years until the Olympics," she 
said. "I just want to take it one step at a time and not worry about everything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment she will set her sights on the league finals today and the CIF 
prelims next week, two meets where she figures to more than hold her own.

BRONCOS TO CHALLENGE LEAGUE BASEBALL LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona baseball team has an outside chance to win its second 
consecutive California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title, but the Broncos need a 
strong performance in a three-game series against first-place Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The teams meet for a single game at 3 p.m. Friday and a double-header at noon 
Saturday, all at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo entered the week at 17-9 in the conference, three games ahead 
of second-place Pomona, and 27-20 overall. Pomona is 13-11 in the CCAA and 
20-26 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been led by catcher Chris Goldbach, who leads the conference with a 
.398 batting average and is tied with outfielder Chris Butterfield for a 
team-high six home runs. Outfielder Brian Grier has a 10-game hitting streak 
and a .349 average. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have won in the conference behind pitching of Wayne Koklys, who is 
6-0 and has a 1.50 earned-run average in CCAA games. Pomona's longtime coach is 
John Scolinos, who has the most wins among active baseball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo swept three games from Cal State Los Angeles last week. The 
Mustangs have a strong pitching staff with Dave Wilson at 5-5 with a 2.58 ERA 
and Greg Paxton at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs are led in hitting by outfielder Billy Smith at .321 and first 
baseman Pat Kirby at .303. Smith and Kirby share the CCAA lead in doubles with 
four each. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona-Pitzer women's tennis team, which was undefeated in Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference play, has been seeded No. 2 in 
the NCAA Division III national tournament that starts Monday at 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
The Sagehens are seeded behind Gustavus Adolphus of Minnesota, which defeated 
Pomona-Pitzer, 5-4, this season. Pomona-Pitzer has drawn a first-round bye and 
will face Skidmore of New York in its opening match Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of talent, we would be an even match for anyone in the draw," Coach 
Lisa Beckett said. "We lost to Gustavus Adolphus but it was a close match. 
We're definitely in the running (for the title). We just have to be mentally 
prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona-Pitzer enters the 10-team national tournament after posting a record of 
10-0 in the SCIAC and 23-2 overall. The Sagehens, who finished sixth in the 
Division III nationals last year, will be appearing in the nationals for the 
sixth time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sagehens have been led in singles by senior Karen Nilsen and freshman 
Shelley Keeler, who have qualified for the individual championships. Nilsen and 
Keeler also could be the favorite in doubles, where they have a 23-0 record 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Conference rivals Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Occidental have qualified 
individuals for the tournament, although neither school advanced as a team. 
</P>
<P>
In singles, competitors include Sue Hulse of Occidental and Mari Uchida of 
Claremont. Occidental also qualified its top doubles team of Hulse and Kim 
Black. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's softball team will try to wrap up third place in 
the Big West Conference when it plays host to San Diego State in a 
double-header at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona entered the week ranked No. 11 in NCAA Division I with a 35-20 record 
and third in the Big West at 21-11. San Diego State is in eighth place in the 
Big West at 9-23 and 18-34-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are hoping to secure their eighth straight berth in the Division I 
playoffs, which start in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been led by senior catcher Denise Correa, who is hitting .285. 
Senior outfielder Nikki Busch and freshman infielder Shellie McCall lead the 
Broncos, each with 22 runs batted. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, coached by Carol Spanks, rely on the pitching of sophomore Nicky 
Luce and senior Lori Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's top players are second baseman Robin Long, who has a .291 
batting average, and pitcher Michelle Wesson, who is 6-15 with a 1.42 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
After guiding Pomona-Pitzer to the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference men's basketball title last season as an interim coach, Charles 
Katsiaficas has been appointed to the position full-time by the athletic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Katsiaficas coached the Sagehens to first place in the SCIAC at 9-1 and an 
18-10 overall record last season. Pomona-Pitzer finished third in the NCAA 
Division III playoffs regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He was also an assistant at Pomona-Pitzer in 1984-86 and was interim coach 
during the 1986-87 season, while former Coach Gregg Popovich was on a 
sabbatical, and coached the Sagehens to second place in the SCIAC at 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Before returning to coach Pomona-Pitzer, he was an assistant at the University 
of San Diego in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey McAulay, an assistant coach at Cal Poly Pomona the last two seasons, has 
been named women's basketball coach at the University of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been one of the perennial powers in NCAA Division II since the 
division was formed in 1982 and the Broncos were successful in McAulay's two 
seasons as an assistant. Pomona reached the Division II quarterfinals in 1988 
and the finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
McAulay also posted a 60-35 record in four years as a high school coach at 
Katella in Anaheim, including her 1987 team that went 27-3 and reached the CIF 
3-A Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Barker, an assistant football coach at the University of Nevada-Reno last 
season, has been named by Pomona-Pitzer as its baseball coach and a football 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of USC, Barker was a baseball and football coach at Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Assn. rival Occidental from 1982 to 1985.

SPORTSSCOPE: UCLA SOFTBALLERS TRY WEAK BEAVERS, DANGEROUS DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top-ranked UCLA women's softball team (35-4 overall, 12-2 in the 
Pacific-10) will play at Oregon State (7-24, 1-15) on Friday and meet 
fifth-ranked Oregon (46-13, 11-5) at Eugene on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Both are double-headers and are key conference games as the regular season 
comes to a close next weekend. The winner of the Pac-10 conference, as well as 
the Big Eight, Big Ten, Big West, Gateway and Mid-America conferences, receives 
automatic bids into the NCAA College World Series, which will be played in 
Sunnyvale, Calif., on May 24-28. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend UCLA defeated U.S. International, 8-0 and 12-0, behind pitchers 
Samantha Ford, a senior, and junior Lisa Lonaker. Third baseman Janice Parks 
had an impressive weekend, hitting five for six with five RBIs, two triples and 
a double. Parks leads the team with 49 hits, seven doubles, six triples and 27 
RBIs. UCLA is hitting .290 compared to its opponents' .120. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA men's volleyball championship will be played at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion 
on Friday and Saturday, with Stanford meeting Ball State at 5:30 p.m. Friday 
while UCLA plays Penn State at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
The losers will meet for third place at 5 p.m. Saturday, followed by the 
championship at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (24-5), making its first tournament appearance, advanced to the final 
four by winning last weekend's Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. 
selection tournament. The Cardinal defeated defending national champion USC in 
four games and Hawaii in five. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State (17-12), in its 10th tournament appearance, won the Midwest 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. title. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State, under first-year Coach Tom Peterson, will be making its sixth 
final-four appearance in the 1980s. The Nittany Lions (16-10) defeated George 
Mason in five games to win the East title. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-time champion UCLA, 27-5 this season and 34-3 in NCAA tournament 
matches, tied with Stanford for the WIVA title and won a coin flip for the 
conference's automatic berth into the tournament. The Bruins are undefeated 
(17-0) in NCAA tournament matches in Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine's baseball team will host Loyola Marymount for a four-game series 
this weekend with the West Coast Athletic Conference title on the line. The 
series begins Friday with a single game at 2:30 p.m. Following a noon 
doubleheader Saturday will be a single game on Sunday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Waves (37-13-1 and 17-3 in WCAC) are currently ranked No. 15 by 
Collegiate Baseball and have an 11-game winning streak, while the Loyola 
Marymount Lions (35-19 and 17-2), ranked No. 14, leads the conference. 
Pepperdine can clinch its sixth WCAC crown and the league's automatic NCAA 
Tournament berth by defeating the Lions three times this weekend. If the Waves 
and Lions split the four-game series, Loyola Marymount would be forced to play 
a makeup game at San Francisco May 14 where a win would secure the conference 
title. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine men's tennis team will meet UCLA at the Los Angeles Tennis

JUROR CHANGES MIND BUT HER CRUSADE TO REVERSE MAN'S ROBBERY CONVICTION FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soon after she and other jurors found Napoleon Winchell Cotton guilty of a 
$75,000 robbery at the Long Beach Naval Station, Winnie Jackson began feeling 
guilty herself. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson decided she'd made a mistake, that Cotton was not the man who committed 
the stickup inside a federal credit union office at the station. And she 
decided to try to reverse the conviction that she and 11 other jurors had voted 
in Long Beach Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the victim in this," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
It is not unusual for jurors to have second thoughts after ruling on a 
hard-fought criminal case. But prosecution and defense attorneys agree that 
Jackson's actions were extraordinary: She called FBI agents and private 
investigators who had looked into the case. She copied police reports that had 
never gotten to the jury. She met with Cotton in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she filed a declaration renouncing her vote of guilty and asked 
Superior Court Judge Eugene J. Long to order a new trial. At her instigation, 
the jury foreman filed a similar declaration. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, when Long brushed aside Jackson's change of heart and sentenced 
Cotton to six years in prison, one of the most disappointed people in court was 
the former juror who had made his case her personal crusade. 
</P>
<P>
For Jackson, a 45-year-old community affairs officer for the Los Angeles County 
Department of Children's Services, the crusade began moments after the jury 
ended six days of deliberations April 10. The panel found Cotton guilty of one 
count of robbery but failed to reach a verdict on a charge that he took $38,835 
from a courier at the Queen Mary/Spruce Goose attractions in Long Beach; the 
vote was 11 to 1, with Jackson holding out. 
</P>
<P>
She was walking from the jurors' box when she saw Cotton's mother in the 
courtroom and decided to explain to the woman why she had voted to convict him 
of the credit union robbery: Eyewitnesses had easily pointed Cotton out in 
court, after all, and testimony painted an unappealing portrait of him as 
someone who at one time kept ledgers for a drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton's mother, Earnest Cotton, responded by saying, "I want to show you some 
reports," Jackson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
They were investigative notes and crime reports, including speculation by an 
FBI agent who interviewed Cotton that he was not the likely robber because he 
did not seem "bright enough to pull off the heists and his life style wasn't 
commensurate with someone who had come into some big cash." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Descriptions Conflict 
</P>
<P>
The reports also included witness descriptions of the robber as a man of medium 
height and build. Cotton is a 6-foot, 210-pound former boxer "who looks a lot 
like Mike Tyson," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't show us any of that. That's evidence. That's hard evidence," 
Jackson exclaimed while studying over the documents spread across the dining 
room table of her Signal Hill condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said she never would have voted to convict if she had seen such 
material. 
</P>
<P>
"I started getting mad as I read them. If I'm going to make a decision, I think 
you would give me everything to . . . make a decision with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To Deputy Dist. Atty. Kirk Newkirk, who prosecuted the case, Jackson is an 
example of a naive juror who does not understand court procedure. In almost all 
cases, certain material is kept from the jury because of rules of evidence or 
trial strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"The only miscarriage of justice was that she hung on Count 1," Newkirk said, 
referring to the Queen Mary holdup. If other jurors made a habit of asking the 
court to reverse verdicts, he noted, "the system would achieve meltdown." 
</P>
<P>
Police speculated that the same person committed the two Long Beach holdups, 
occurring in January and February of 1988. Cotton became a suspect because he 
had worked for an armored car company that served the credit union and quit 
shortly before the robberies, failing even to pick up his last paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton said he was in Mississippi at the time, but the victims identified his 
photograph and he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
To ask the judge to set aside the verdict, Jackson typed out a declaration in 
proper legal form with the help of a friend who works in the courts. The 
13-page document elaborates the reasons she changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
In imposing sentence Wednesday, the judge made only passing reference to the 
juror's petition and commended the defense attorney -- whom Jackson had 
criticized. "This was a planned, premeditated, sophisticated robbery," Long 
said, agreeing with the prosecutor that Cotton should have been found guilty of 
the Queen Mary robbery as well. 
</P>
<P>
Outside court, a shaken Jackson condemned "the system," and said she still 
believes she had not overstepped her role. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not passing the buck and I'm not saying I'm irresponsible . . . but I have 
a right to look into it if what I'm saying is putting someone in jail," she 
said.

GLOOMY RAMIREZ WANTS NO DEFENSE IN 'STALKER' CASE, HIS ATTORNEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gloomy and "emotionally distraught" Richard Ramirez wants to forgo any 
defense, even an opening statement, in the so-called Night Stalker trial 
despite the advice of his lawyers, one of Ramirez's attorneys said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Ramirez) thinks that it won't do any good," Ray G. Clark said 
Wednesday in explaining why he and co-counsel Daniel V. Hernandez have told 
Judge Michael A. Tynan that they may present no defense case when the trial 
resumes on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Between now and then, Clark said in an interview, he and Hernandez will attempt 
to change their client's mind, and hope to elicit the help of Ramirez's parents 
toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
Case law is not entirely clear on whether defense lawyers may go ahead with a 
defense over a client's objections in a death penalty case, and Clark said he 
has been consulting with the State Bar's Ethics Committee and the California 
Appellate Project, which provides assistance to lawyers handling such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"But my understanding is that we have the right to have an opening statement 
and call witnesses, and he (the defendant) has the right to testify or not 
testify," Clark added. 
</P>
<P>
Until last Monday, Ramirez had been prepared to go along with his attorneys' 
plans to present a defense, including calling about a dozen witnesses on his 
behalf, Clark said. But Ramirez then began "wobbling and sliding back," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a tendency to cut things short," Clark added. "He says he's tired of 
being in jail, the food is bad, etc." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said Ramirez became so upset that he staged a "shouting match" while 
meeting with his attorneys in a holding cell during a trial recess earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
At a private meeting Tuesday afternoon with Tynan and prosecutors Phil Halpin 
and Alan Yochelson, Clark told the judge that Ramirez "doesn't want us to make 
an opening statement," and therefore the lawyers must consider resting their 
case without mounting a defense whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution rested its case on Tuesday after three months, and the defense 
lawyers were to have begun their case, starting with an opening statement 
today. But Tynan granted Clark and Hernandez a recess until Monday so they 
could further consult with one another and with Ramirez and his family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Go for Victory' 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who was appointed by the judge in March to help with the defense, said 
he very much favors a vigorous defense. "My position is: Hey, let's try to win 
this -- go for victory on as many counts as possible, or all of them. But I'm 
keeping an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies in a wave of 
night-time attacks throughout Los Angeles County, most in the spring and summer 
of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Since his serial-murder trial began Jan. 30, six survivors have identified 
Ramirez as their attacker, and prosecutors have presented a mass of 
incriminating evidence, including firearms results, shoe prints, fingerprints 
and jewelry linked to Ramirez that other witnesses have said were taken from 
the scene of seven of the 15 alleged Night Stalker attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Clark had said the main thrust of the defense would be to show that 
Ramirez has been a victim of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
It is not unheard of for criminal defense lawyers to mount no defense and 
instead simply to argue to a jury that the government has failed to prove a 
defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUGE SETTLEMENT IN BKK LANDFILL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 500 people who lived near the BKK Landfill in West Covina before it 
was closed to toxic waste in 1984 are sharing in one of the largest settlements 
ever obtained in a toxic-waste case -- $43 million, lawyers disclosed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed in 1980 against BKK Corp. and W&amp;A Builders Inc., which built 
homes near the dump, was settled in 1986. The amount of money involved, 
however, was not disclosed until documents were unsealed Wednesday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Herbert Hafif, who represents 508 residents, said his clients are 
receiving $7 million from BKK Corp. and $3.2 million from W&amp;A Builders. The 
rest of the money is coming from insurance companies that issued polices to 
BKK. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said in their suit that the dump created health and safety problems. 
More than 3.4 million tons of hazardous waste are buried in the BKK Landfill, 
making it one of the nation's largest toxic-waste sites.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAIDS NET DRUGS, CASH, 4 SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton and Artesia police confiscated 150 pounds of cocaine worth about $22 
million and arrested four people suspected of trying to sell it in raids ending 
Wednesday at three Los Angeles County residences. 
</P>
<P>
Police also seized assault weapons and $250,000 in suspected drug cash at homes 
in Artesia, Bell and Paramount in the raids. 
</P>
<P>
The police agencies had been following the suspected drug dealers in Fullerton 
early Tuesday during a separate drug investigation, Fullerton Police Capt. Lee 
DeVore said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cocaine was discovered in the Artesia residence, as was the money 
and weapons, DeVore said. Police seized two AK-47 assault rifles and several 
semiautomatic handguns. Three of the four suspects were arrested at the Artesia 
residence. A fourth was detained at the Bell residence. 
</P>
<P>
Booked into the Fullerton City Jail on suspicion of sale of cocaine were: Jorge 
Cano, 27, of Artesia; his wife, Maria, 21; Jose Lopez, 21, of Los Angeles, and 
Jose Heras, 28, of Bell. The four were each being held in lieu of $1-million 
bonds.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-JUSTICE NAMED GRAND JURY COUNSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired California Supreme Court Justice Otto M. Kaus on Wednesday was 
appointed special counsel to the Los Angeles County Grand Jury to direct an 
investigation into whether local law enforcement officials have misused 
jailhouse informants. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Dewitt Clinton said the county has agreed to pay up to $250,000 
for the services of Kaus and other members of his firm and, in addition, will 
provide Kaus with an investigative staff. 
</P>
<P>
Kaus, who served on the state Supreme Court from 1981 to 1985, said he will 
head a team of lawyers composed of Warren L. Ettinger and Dan Marmalefsky. All 
three are partners in the downtown Los Angeles law firm of Hufstedler, Miller, 
Kaus &amp; Beardsley. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to meet my client, the grand jury, tomorrow," Kaus said Wednesday, 
"and we'll give them a vague outline of how to proceed. None of us has ever 
done this before." 
</P>
<P>
Kaus added, "We do not consider it our mission to establish in individual cases 
that one individual prisoner is entitled to a new trial. . . . We are engaged 
in helping the grand jury in its statutory task of smoking out wrongdoing in 
the county." 
</P>
<P>
Kaus, who was appointed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp after the grand jury 
requested a special counsel, said he expects the investigation to take months.

NEVADA VOTERS TO TAX GOLD MINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CARSON CITY, Nev. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters have overwhelmingly approved a new tax on miners, many of whom are 
enjoying a gold bonanza rivaling this state's famed Comstock Lode era. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also approved a plan to double the money Nevada can borrow for new 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary mining tax, which is expected to raise $52 million, won with 
107,679 votes to 30,663 in Tuesday's election. Voter turnout was 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada is the nation's leading producer of gold. In the last eight years, mines 
here have produced more than 12 million troy ounces of gold with a value of 
about $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
At today's prices, that amount equals the value of all the gold and silver 
unearthed in Virginia City during the two-decade Comstock Lode era that began 
in the late 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
The mining tax was submitted to voters after a bitter debate in which 
Democratic Gov. Bob Miller accused mining industry lobbyists of deceit in 
trying to derail his proposal for a tax.

GREAT CHALK-MARK CAPER AND ARREST OF TWO WOMEN AROUSE PENINSULA TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone, it seems, has an opinion in the great Palos Verdes Estates parking 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Gary Johansen said 50 people have called or written him -- either 
praising him as a defender of the law or accusing him of turning the city into 
a police state. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the feelings is the arrest, handcuffing, fingerprinting and 
frisking April 21 of two businesswomen who police say wiped chalk marks off 
their car tires to avoid parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Police filed misdemeanor charges this week against Rosina Baur, manager of the 
Coldwell Banker real estate office in the Malaga Cove Plaza shopping center, 
and Anne Bisco, a receptionist with the same office. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, each faces up to a $1,000 fine and six months in jail. They are 
to appear in court June 6. 
</P>
<P>
The case has aroused strong feelings on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, where Baur 
has lived for 30 years and where Bisco arrived several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equal Criticism, Praise 
</P>
<P>
Johansen said his department has taken equal doses of criticism and praise. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is in the middle," Johansen said. "Either we are the Gestapo, or they 
say, 'Right on, you did exactly the right thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on a Friday morning at the shopping plaza, where finding 
parking is a problem. A meter maid reported that chalk marks she had left on 
Baur's Mazda and Bisco's Toyota had been wiped off. 
</P>
<P>
The meter maid notified Officer Robert Connor, according to Johansen, who 
walked into the Coldwell Banker office and told Baur and Bisco that they were 
under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The women followed Connor to his squad car, where they were handcuffed and 
driven to police headquarters for booking, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bisco acknowledged that she wiped a chalk mark off her car's tire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrests Called Unnecessary 
</P>
<P>
But Baur denied that she did, saying that she merely moved her car to another 
space when she saw the meter maid coming. Such a move is legal, since the 
one-hour time limit applies to individual spaces, not to the entire lot, a 
police official said. 
</P>
<P>
The women said their arrests were unnecessary and that Connor told them he was 
going to arrest them to "teach them a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Bisco said she expects to be through with the case after going to court and 
paying a fine. 
</P>
<P>
But Baur has hired an attorney, Ray Legg, to fight the charge. Legg said 
several witnesses will verify that Baur moved her car and did not rub off a 
chalk mark. 
</P>
<P>
Johansen said that Connor and other officers have been instructed not to 
comment but that the department is "feeling put upon" by publicity from the 
case.

Who are these horses, and don't they know nobody will remember who they were a 
year from today? A week from today? They came here to be in the chorus. They 
should have brought a spear to carry. They're just the posse here. 
</P>
<P>
What are all these trainers who should know better doing in this Kentucky 
Derby? Can't they read? Don't their clocks work? 
</P>
<P>
Let me ask you something. If Man o' War were in this field, would there be 15 
other horses willing to go out there to watch him go by? 
</P>
<P>
The question of the 115th Kentucky Derby is not whether Easy Goer is better 
than, say, Shy Tom, Clever Trevor, Wind Splitter or Irish Actor. It's whether 
he's better than Sir Barton. Or Secretariat. Or Seattle Slew. Citation. Man o' 
War. Pegasus. Trigger. Does he have five legs? Can he read? Count? 
</P>
<P>
If this weren't a Derby, he'd probably have to carry 140 pounds. And maybe an 
anvil and a microwave oven. Maybe they should tie two of his legs together. Or 
just split this year's Derby into two sections. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they should disqualify him altogether. As a monopoly. A combination in 
restraint of trade. Unconstitutional. Un-American. 
</P>
<P>
Is that all bad? Do you come 2,000 miles to get in on a monologue? Do you hate 
suspense? Like the old Yankees, did you? Leahy's and Rockne's Notre Dame? Root 
for the iceberg over the Titanic? Like coaches who pour it on? How about Joe 
Louis' fights? Mike Tyson's? A chalk player from way back? 
</P>
<P>
This Derby might be right down your alley. 
</P>
<P>
You may have a point. I can dig it. I mean, what do you want to see, Cannonade 
winning a Derby? Gato Del Sol? Decidedly? What do you want -- history or a 
longshot? 
</P>
<P>
Delighted, were you, when Native Dancer lost the only race he would ever lose 
right here in a Derby? It didn't bother you that the horse who beat him, Dark 
Star, never won another race? Seeing a classic horse in the winner's circle 
make you gnash your teeth? 
</P>
<P>
There have been enough Derbies won by Dust Commanders, Count Turfs, Venetian 
Ways, horses that will never be statues in anybody's paddock. 
</P>
<P>
So what if it's a walk in the park for Easy Goer? 
</P>
<P>
When you go to a golf tournament, do you like to see Arnold Palmer get beat by 
George Archer? Glad to see Greg Norman hit a ball in the water? Like to see 
some nobody chip in over Jack Nicklaus' head on 18? Did you throw a party when 
Jack Fleck beat Ben Hogan in 1955? 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with virtuousity prevailing? Do you root for a guy to get a hit 
when Nolan Ryan has two out in the ninth without having given up any to then? 
Like to see Babe Ruth strike out, would you? Want Sandy Koufax to get knocked 
out of the box in the first inning? 
</P>
<P>
If you went to the Louvre, would you skip the Mona Lisa and ooh and aah over a 
lot of seascapes? Rather see a chain saw massacre movie than "The Bridge on the 
River Kwai?" Like to see Caruso choke on a high C? Prefer rock to Beethoven, 
"Dynasty" to Shakespeare? 
</P>
<P>
We've got enough .200 hitters in the world, enough guys who win split 
decisions, pitch seven innings, shoot 72s, play doubles, punt on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
You don't go to a Kentucky Derby to see Proud Clarion or Riva Ridge or Kauai 
King. You go to see Swaps beat Nashua. You go to see Aristides. Exterminator. 
Citation. Count Fleet. Secretariat. Affirmed. You go to see Triple Crown 
winners, royalty. The sport of kings should not belong to clodhoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Like to see Man o' War beaten by some claimer, would you? Pay money to see 
Dempsey get clinched to death? Like seeing Muhammad Ali pummeled by a palooka? 
</P>
<P>
We're drowning in mediocrity as it is, running out of heroes. You might say 
running out of class. It's interesting that, in the first 105 runnings of the 
Kentucky Derby, only one filly ever won it. In this decade alone, two have won 
it so far. And that was out of only five entered in the nine years. 
</P>
<P>
You remember Derbies by the renown of winners. Horsemen will talk of Gallant 
Fox's Derby, or Whirlaway's, or Citation's, Secretariat's. People have trouble 
remembering what year Pleasant Colony won. Or even if he did. 
</P>
<P>
So, Easy Goer has a chance to be a horse for the ages. He's been beaten. But so 
was Secretariat. So, in fact, was Man o' War. 
</P>
<P>
You might wish he had a better name -- Red Gold, or Diamond Jim. Easy Goer is 
kind of tacky for a great performer. Hollywood would change it. It's not a name 
to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
We don't even have names anymore. Back when the movies had Greta Garbo (for 
Gustaffson), Theda Bara (for Theodosia Goodman) and Robert Taylor (for Spangler 
Brugh), horses were named Twenty Grand, Cavalcade, Reigh Count, Discovery and 
War Admiral. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they're named Easy Goer. Or Spend a Buck. Even the female horses don't 
escape. No Lady Godiva or Miss America but Genuine Risk. What kind of handle is 
that for a great lady? 
</P>
<P>
By any other name, Easy Goer can run. Beaten by a nose as a maiden and by a 
length in the Breeder's Cup on a track that had the consistency of ground 
glass, he has the longest stride and prettiest action of any horse of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
He's as royally bred as the Hapsburgs. He traces his ancestry back to Native 
Dancer, who lost this race in the greatest mistake of the century in racing. 
</P>
<P>
So, the proposition is simple: Do you hope for a horse race? Or do you want to 
say, "I was there Easy Goer's year"? 
</P>
<P>
Would you want to have seen the World Series in which Ruth called his shot? Or 
kept hitting grounders to second? 
</P>
<P>
You want to see history -- or the eighth race? Do you want an exacta -- or a 
memory? 
</P>
<P>
If Shy Tom or Clever Trevor beats him, it's just another stake. If he goes on 
to win a Triple Crown, it becomes an I-was-there Derby. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they could think about changing that name. Garbo would be 
nice.

DESPITE A SWEEP, KNICKS HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF BARKLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

PHILADELPHIA

<P>
It was touted as the most competitive of the opening-round National Basketball 
Assn. playoff series, but the New York Knicks' paper-thin eight-point margin 
during its 3-0 sweep of the Philadelphia 76ers might have been considerably 
greater were it not for the formidable presence of Charles Barkley. The trigger 
man of the 76ers' offense, the power forward drew double teams virtually every 
time he touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Down the stretch of each game, Barkley took over, muscling his way to the 
basket, grabbing or keeping rebounds alive for teammates or passing off for 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm one of the two or three best players on the planet Earth. Taking 
over is my job," he explained. "I've talked with Michael (Jordan) about it -- 
I'm capable of doing it and there's no reason not to." 
</P>
<P>
But although Barkley put up some prodigious numbers during the three-game 
series, averaging 27 points, 12 rebounds and five assists, he learned that one 
man, no matter how great, isn't enough during the playoffs. So it is that the 
Knicks find themselves in the conference semifinals, awaiting the winner of the 
Chicago-Cleveland series. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks' 116-115 overtime victory wrapping up the series Tuesday night 
showed the difference between a competent team and an outstanding individual. 
It was also indicative of the young New York squad's development this season. 
</P>
<P>
Although they have all-stars Patrick Ewing and Mark Jackson, the Knicks don't 
have a single force whose play demands the basketball in the waning stages of a 
game, a' la Barkley. At times that appears to be a liability, such as in the 
fourth quarter of Game 3, when the five Knicks on the floor were practically 
tripping over themselves trying to rush to glory. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a big shot to be made, everybody wants to take it," said Ewing. "No 
one's gonna shrug away from it. I think that shows character." 
</P>
<P>
With six seconds to play in overtime it was guard Gerald Wilkins who came up 
big, hitting a jumper from near the top of the key. The shot came after a 
dribble to the right, with Wilkins shooting on the move, a play he's supposedly 
unable to make. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took the shot I didn't have time to hesitate," he said. "It seemed like 
when I was up in the air it was just me." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins ended the game with 22 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and four 
steals. Before Barkley forced the overtime, with eight points, a steal and a 
blocked shot in the final 3:37 of regulation, it appeared Jackson would be the 
hero. His pair of three-point field goals helped the Knicks overcome an early 
fourth-quarter deficit and go up by 100-94 with four minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
The back-court efforts were needed because Ewing was struggling to a 
three-for-12, eight-point night. The former Georgetown star's problems weren't 
entirely of his own making. In foul trouble early, Ewing was whistled for his 
fourth personal with 10:02 to play in the fourth quarter. Ewing complained, but 
moments later he was called for his fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all judgment calls but unfortunately I was on the short end of the 
stick," he said. "But we won anyway, so that's over and done with." 
</P>
<P>
With a couple of bounces off the rim, the Knicks could be over and done with. 
New York clinched a 102-96 Game 1 victory when Jackson hit a 30-foot jumper to 
beat the shot clock in the final minute of play, then took seemingly lost Game 
2 when Trent Tucker hit another three-pointer with 10 seconds remaining.

KINGS LAUNCH THEIR HUNT FOR 'NEW BLOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The list of candidates for the coaching job that became available when the 
Kings fired Robbie Ftorek Tuesday is taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
It is being compiled by General Manager Rogie Vachon and probably won't include 
anyone who would demand to be general manager as well as coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Rogie is our general manager and he'll be back; that's for sure," owner Bruce 
McNall said Wednesday from New York, where he is attending meetings of the 
National Hockey League's expansion committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you're hearing about some good coaches who would only come if they 
could be general manager, too. I've heard the same thing. But who knows if 
that's true? If I believed everything I heard along the way, I'd be starving 
today. I have learned that you have to find out these things for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know right now who our next coach is going to be, and I won't 
know until I've had a chance to get to know some of these guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do anything real quick. I want to get the right guy. I don't 
want to go off half-cocked and end up firing another coach in six months." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Taylor, King captain, agrees on that point. Taylor has had nine coaches in 
his 12 years with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice if we could be more stable," Taylor said. "This next coach 
will be the 10th coach I've had. We had so many new players this year, too. 
Hopefully, whoever comes in will be able to bring it all together and be here 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little disappointed for Robbie because I thought he did a pretty good 
job and, as the season went along, I thought we got better as a team. Losing to 
Calgary wasn't the coach's fault. 
</P>
<P>
"But I understand what Rogie was saying about getting someone who is better 
with veteran players. We need someone to handle all the personalities on the 
team. Not that we were a difficult team. But we had such a wide range of 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Sykes, who has been with the Kings through parts of seven seasons and 
through six coaches, said that he thinks the next coach probably will need to 
"under-coach and over-manage" to get the most out of the veteran team. "It's 
not a question of teaching most of these guys to play hockey," Sykes said. 
</P>
<P>
Of Ftorek's firing, Sykes said: "Well, I guess from my personal point of view 
it's a fairly decent thing for me. My position wasn't too good with him. All it 
can do for me is open the door. I just have to hope it's a coach who wants to 
include me in his plans." 
</P>
<P>
Sykes said he and teammate Tom Laidlaw discussed what the Kings should be 
looking for in the perfect coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We were saying it should be someone who can really get along with the media, 
like (Laker Coach) Pat Riley," Sykes said. "Someone colorful and witty. Someone 
who has a lot of confidence in himself and in his hockey knowledge. Someone who 
can manage a bunch of superstar hockey players. We don't know who that is. Does 
that guy exist?" 
</P>
<P>
McNall is about to find out. 
</P>
<P>
McNall would not comment, specifically, on the names being mentioned. But he 
did say that he wanted "new blood." 
</P>
<P>
McNall said: "I would prefer not to have the old, recycled coach who has been 
fired five times before. Not someone who has been kicking around forever." 
</P>
<P>
He also said: "I don't want to have to have any big battles with any other 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
That would seem to rule out Bob McCammon of Vancouver -- who reportedly would 
be looking to move up to a GM-coaching position -- and John Muckler, who would 
not be easily let go by Edmonton owner Peter Pocklington. Pocklington already 
has been hanged in effigy for letting Wayne Gretzky go to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
That would seem to leave Colin Campbell as the most likely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who played with Gretzky in Edmonton, has been an assistant coach with 
Detroit for four years and would be "new blood" as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
But McNall said: "If I were you, I wouldn't jump to any conclusions and I 
wouldn't rule out anybody. I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
This process might take some time. 
</P>
<P>
McNall said that he and Gretzky, who has been in New York to tape some 
commercials and a "Saturday Night Live" show, will attend the Kentucky Derby. 
McNall also owns horses, although he doesn't have one running in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get back, I'll take the list that Rogie is putting together and we'll 
start to work on it together," McNall said. "This time I want Rogie to be very 
comfortable with the coach. I want the coach to be real comfortable with me and 
with the players. I'd like for everyone to be in harmony." 
</P>
<P>
McNall considered his last words and then laughed, adding, "Well, I'd like for 
everyone to be in harmony at the start of the season, at least." 
</P>
<P>
Vachon had said that he wanted to be able to announce the new coach before the 
NHL meetings and draft in mid-June. McNall said Wednesday that he would like to 
make a decision by June 1 so that the new coach would have time to discuss 
prospects for the draft with the team's scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in no big hurry," McNall said. "I'd like to find the best coach we can 
possibly get. We wanted the best hockey player in the world and we got him. We 
want the best coach. If he's not available, then we'll go right down the line 
until we get the best coach who is available. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's worth the time."

Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson suffered side effects associated with steroid use 
19 months ago, including breast enlargement and insomnia, his family doctor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying in Toronto as part of a Canadian inquiry into drugs and sports, Dr. 
Jack Sussman said he had been baffled by tremendous muscle development in 
Johnson, who had first visited him as a scrawny Jamaican immigrant in 1979. 
Johnson was stripped of an Olympic gold medal when steroids were found in his 
urine last fall at the Seoul Games. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to medical charts throughout his testimony, Sussman said he had 
suspected that Johnson was on banned muscle-building drugs in October of 1987, 
when the sprinter's left breast grew unnaturally large. 
</P>
<P>
The condition is one of the less serious side effects of steroid use. But 
Sussman said that when he asked Johnson directly, he denied using steroids.

Baseball's investigation into Pete Rose's alleged gambling will be completed 
next week when a report is submitted to Commissioner Bart Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Levin, a spokesman for the commissioner, said that John M. Dowd, the 
Washington lawyer heading the inquiry, would submit his findings to Giamatti, 
who will then decide if any action will be taken against the Cincinnati Reds' 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication as to when Giamatti would make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who has refused to comment on whether he bet on baseball, missed two 
games against Montreal because of flu and returned to Cincinnati Wednesday 
rather than go to New York with the team.

The San Diego Yacht Club asked a Manhattan appeals court Wednesday to overturn 
a judge's ruling that awarded the America's Cup to a New Zealand boating club 
after the competition off San Diego last September. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast sailors said that the ruling March 28 by state Supreme Court 
Justice Carmen Ciparick was improper because the judge invented a rule that 
didn't exist and illegally ordered the cup forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the SDYC had "violated the spirit" of the race by using a 
catamaran to defend the cup against the Mercury Bay Boating Club's 
single-hulled yacht. 
</P>
<P>
The judge called the contest, which the San Diegans won, "a gross mismatch" and 
ordered the 138-year-old silver cup turned over to the New Zealanders. 
</P>
<P>
Oral arguments before the state Supreme Court's appellate division have not 
been scheduled yet. In their filing Wednesday, the San Diegans pointed to 
Ciparick's phrase saying the boats should be "somewhat evenly matched." 
</P>
<P>
They said there was no such provision in the "Deed of Gift," a document that 
sets the rules for America's Cup races. "The court below was wrong," the San 
Diego club argued. It called the forfeiture "drastic and unfair" and asked the 
appeals court to reverse it.

Funeral services were held Wednesday for John (Stumpy) Thomason, 83, whose 
fumble in the 1929 Rose Bowl game led to the "Wrong Way Riegels" play in 
Georgia Tech's 8-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Thomason, a retired automobile dealer and a member of the Georgia Sports Hall 
of Fame, played halfback at Georgia Tech in 1927-1929. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the second quarter of the Rose Bowl that California center Roy 
Riegels scooped Thomason's fumble and went 66 yards in the wrong direction 
before he realized his mistake, turned around and was tackled by Georgia Tech 
at his 1-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Vance Maree broke through the line and blocked a punt for the 
winning safety. 
</P>
<P>
Thomason scored the touchdown in the win which led to Georgia Tech's 10-0 
season. He went on to play professional football with the Philadelphia Eagles 
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.

MANAGEMENT AT HERALD WORKS ON BUYOUT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top executive at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner said Wednesday that he is 
working on a proposal for a management-led buyout of the paper by a group that 
would include employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a long shot," said John J. McCabe, the paper's chief operating 
executive, who began to outline the proposal on Tuesday. "We have to develop a 
strategic plan and ascertain if there would be equity funding available." 
</P>
<P>
McCabe said the paper's owner, New York-based Hearst Corp., last week gave him 
the go-ahead to put together a buyout proposal. McCabe said he approached 
Hearst management with his idea several weeks ago, after officials from the 
Toronto Sun and oil tycoon Marvin Davis had separately shown an interest in the 
daily paper but then decided against buying it. 
</P>
<P>
"What is implicit is that the paper is up for sale," said McCabe, who has 
worked at the Herald since 1983. "Hearst would not have people taking a look at 
the paper if it was not up for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Hearst officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe, who announced his plans to a group of the paper's editors Wednesday 
afternoon, said his proposal would be based on converting the 
242,000-circulation daily to a tabloid format. "That would give us an 
opportunity to find that niche that we have not found in our marketplace," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe stressed the plan is risky. "It would take several years to turn it 
around," he said. "The big 'if' is if there is funding out there to support 
such an endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
The financing search will begin after the strategic plan is done, probably by 
the end of May, McCabe said. Hearst has not set a deadline for submitting the 
plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave no details, McCabe said all employees of the paper, not just 
top managers, would be allowed to participate in the buyout.

Airbus Industrie Order: Trans European Airways signed a contract with Airbus 
Industrie for eight new aircraft and options for four more jetliners in the 
largest order the European aircraft maker has ever received from a charter 
airline. TEA, of Belgium, will take delivery on the eight A310-300, wide-bodied 
planes beginning in late 1990, an Airbus statement said. The planes will seat 
275 passengers in an all-economy layout. The total price of the deal was not 
disclosed, but Airbus said each of the jetliners costs about $62 million.

Drabinsky Seeks New Partners: Garth Drabinsky, chairman of Cineplex Odeon, said 
he will try to form an investment group to make a tender offer for an 
unspecified number of shares of the Toronto-based movie theater company. A deal 
for an earlier Drabinsky group to buy a 30% interest from the Charles R. 
Bronfman family of Canada was abandoned last week after it was opposed by 
Canadian securities regulators and MCA, which owns 49% of Cineplex. Drabinsky 
and Cineplex Vice Chairman Myron I. Gottlieb said in a filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission that they will solicit former group members 
and "other persons, firms and corporations" about forming the new group.

Bell May Stop Work on V-22: Bell Helicopter Textron will begin layoffs next 
week unless the Pentagon restores funding for the Osprey V-22 tilt-rotor 
aircraft, a company spokesman said. In a letter to the Defense Department, Bell 
said it would halt work on the program Friday and begin laying off about 2,000 
employees Monday. Bell has been threatening to lay off employees in Ft. Worth, 
since last week, when it became clear the Osprey was in trouble. Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney announced $10 billion in defense cuts -- among them, the 
V-22 program.

An unidentified letter writer claimed responsibility for pounding bridge spikes 
into trees in the Clearwater National Forest to prevent a proposed timber sale, 
endangering those who log the trees, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Margie Ewing, district ranger for the Clearwater Forest at Powell, 12 miles 
west of Lolo Pass near the Idaho-Montana state line, said officials received a 
letter last week warning them the tree spiking had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"We have verified that the trees were spiked," Ewing said. "We're not sure of 
the extent of it yet." 
</P>
<P>
The typewritten letter said 500 pounds of bridge spikes were hammered into 
trees at the proposed Post Office timber sale near Powell on the Lochsa River. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed, in type, by George Hayduke, the fictitious hero of 
Edward Abbey's book "The Monkey Wrench Gang."

FIRST EXECUTIVE WILL SELL UNIT TO BOOST CAPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSIAL INSURANCE FIRM TO TAKE LOSS IN DEAL

First Executive Corp., the controversial Los Angeles life insurance company 
that has been deliberately reducing sales of certain products to bolster its 
capital position, said Wednesday that it will sell its New York insurance 
subsidiary for an expected price of about $460 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 99%-owned subsidiary, Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York, will be 
sold to WW Acquisition Corp. The buyer is a newly formed concern headed by Leo 
M. Walsh Jr., former chief operating officer of Equitable Life Assurance 
Society of the United States, and Martin J. Wygod, a private real estate 
investor and chairman and chief executive of Medco Containment Services. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive said the sale will result in a loss of about $150 million, 
which will be reported in its first quarter. However, the deal will boost the 
firm's capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Search for Buyer 
</P>
<P>
The sale, when completed, will end a search begun in late 1987 by First 
Executive for a buyer of the New York subsidiary, which accounted for about 26% 
of the parent company's 1988 profit and 22% of its assets. The subsidiary's 
products, primarily single-premium life insurance and annuity products, require 
capital reserves to be set aside to meet estimated future payment obligations 
on the policies. 
</P>
<P>
Reserves also must be set aside for possible losses in First Executive's large 
investments in high-yield "junk bonds," a controversial practice that has 
netted First Executive handsome profits while raising the ire of regulators who 
consider those bonds risky. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the strain on its reserves, First Executive has been deliberately 
slowing sales of certain life insurance and annuity products, particularly at 
the New York subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary also has been embroiled in a controversy involving its practices 
in reinsurance, the process by which insurers pass along risks to other 
insurers. Questions regarding the subsidiary's accounting practices on 
reinsurance deals resulted in the New York State Insurance Department fining it 
a record $250,000 in 1987 and requiring the parent company to make a 
$151.5-million cash infusion to the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which has yet to be resolved, is believed to have contributed to 
First Executive's desire to sell the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Sale of the subsidiary is subject to numerous conditions and regulatory 
approvals by the New York and California insurance departments, which are 
expected to take several months, First Executive said.

APRIL AUTO SALES SUGGEST MARKET HAS SLOWED DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite widespread incentives introduced by the auto industry at the end of 
March, U.S. sales rose just 4.9% in April, suggesting a fundamental slowdown, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Total auto sales -- including domestics and imports -- were 909,776 units in 
the month, compared with 902,321 units in April of last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The incentives helped, but not as much as they did last year," when similar 
programs were in effect, said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst with 
Ferman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney. "The market has slowed down. Everybody 
has been expecting the pause for three years, and it's finally come. People 
have spent a lot of money on cars and trucks in the last five or six years. 
They're very reluctant to buy now." 
</P>
<P>
"Sales certainly weren't as strong as the auto manufacturers hoped they would 
be," agreed Christopher Cedergren, an automotive analyst with J. D. Power &amp; 
Associates. "The incentives aren't having the pull that the manufacturers 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Since incentives are having little effect, analysts predicted that sales would 
drop further in May and June, regardless of whether or not the programs are 
extended. They also suggested that production cuts may be necessary in the 
third quarter of 1989 in order to keep down Detroit's inventories of unsold 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic auto industry -- which includes foreign companies that manufacture 
cars in the U.S. -- reported that domestic sales for the period rose to 
667,444, up 6.5% from 651,560 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Among Detroit's Big Three auto makers, General Motors' sales rose 1.2%, Ford's 
sales jumped 12.9% and Chrysler's sales fell 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the percentage increase in domestic sales was due to increased 
production among the foreign companies at their new U.S. assembly plants, many 
of which are just gearing up for full operations. For example, Toyota's sales 
increased 311.8% and Mazda's sales jumped 85.1%. Mitsubishi reported sales of 
1,939 U.S.-made autos, but there were no comparable year-ago figures for the 
firm because it just started production last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Import sales rose a slight 0.5% in April, with Honda's import sales showing the 
greatest increase -- 31.7%. European sales, including luxury makers like Audi, 
BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Porsche and Saab, fell 4.4% in the period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AUTO SALES 
</P>
<P>
Percentage changes in auto sales for the month of April are based on daily 
rates rather than total sales volume. There were 25 selling days in the current 
period and 26 in the year-ago period.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: MAGELLAN EXPLORES, ORGANIZES DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence J. Magid, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some people just don't have the heart to throw out an old computer file. Any 
program or data that winds up on their hard-disk storage equipment stays there. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, that hard disk can become an unwieldy mess. And when the time comes 
to find a file whose name you no longer remember, you're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus Development, the publisher of the best-selling spreadsheet program 1-2-3, 
has come up with a solution. Lotus Magellan, named after the 15th-Century 
Portuguese explorer, helps you sail through the "unchartered territory" of your 
hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is more than the run-of-the-mill "disk organizer." There are lots of 
programs that share Magellan's ability to show directory listings sorted 
alphabetically, by size or by date of last change to perform such useful but 
mundane tasks as copying, moving, renaming and deleting files. Magellan's 
genius is its ability to organize your files based on their content. 
</P>
<P>
When you first use the program, it creates an index of your hard disk by 
examining every file and recording information about each file's contents. This 
one-time process can take up to an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan's screen is divided into two vertical windows. The left window shows a 
list of file names while the window on the right shows the contents of the file 
that is highlighted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Junk Files 
</P>
<P>
That right-hand window display is no mere summary. It's the complete file, just 
as it looks when displayed by the program that created it. A Lotus 1-2-3 
spreadsheet actually looks like a spreadsheet. Same is true with a dBase 
database file, a WordPerfect document and other data files that were created 
with one of the programs that Magellan works with. 
</P>
<P>
This browsing feature can be enormously helpful. If nothing else, it's a great 
housecleaning tool. I was shocked at how many junk files Magellan helped me 
discover. Fortunately, you can delete files while Magellan is running. 
</P>
<P>
A program similar to Magellan, called ViewLink, recently was released by 
Traveling Software. Like Magellan, ViewLink lets you organize information by 
subject rather than by the physical location of your files on the hard disk. 
ViewLink also lets you set up links between files so that you can quickly jump 
from one related file to another, even if they were created by different 
programs. Unlike Magellan, however, the program doesn't let you display the 
contents of files, and thus isn't as useful for some people. 
</P>
<P>
(ViewLink has a suggested retail price of $150 and is available from Traveling 
Software at 18702 North Creek Parkway; Bothell, Wash. 98011. Phone: (206) 
483-8088 or (800) 343-8080.) 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, Magellan's left window lists all the files on your disk. Needless 
to say, that can be unwieldy. To prevent information overload, the program 
allows you to create an "explore path" to limit the number of files listed in 
that window. The explore path is set by pressing a function key that takes you 
temporarily to a screen where you specify the type of files you wish to see. 
</P>
<P>
The most impressive part of the explore command is its ability to find files 
based on any text or numbers that appear in the files. This way, you can locate 
data even if you don't know the name of the files or where they are located. 
And it's not just limited to word processing. It will find information in 
spreadsheets, databases or any other application that it knows about. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Automatically Loads It 
</P>
<P>
The process is amazingly fast. It took Magellan less than 5 seconds to scan my 
20-megabyte hard disk to find 26 files containing the words "desktop 
publishing." Once the search was complete, only the files that met the search 
criterion remained in the left window. 
</P>
<P>
Those files can be browsed within Magellan or you can use the program's 
"launch" function to bring up the program that created the file. Magellan then 
will automatically load the specified file into memory. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've located a group of related files, you can assign a name to the 
group and add that name to a menu. Then, if you need access to files on the 
specified subject, you can merely select the menu item and Magellan limits its 
file display to the relevant files. This allows you to organize your files by 
subject without having to physically move them into a special directory. 
</P>
<P>
A grouping can be created using the search command or by specifying files by 
name. And you can always add files later on. 
</P>
<P>
Another useful feature is the ability to gather bits and pieces of information 
from various files and turn it into a single file. This can be a very good way 
to quickly assemble notes on a subject. You might not be interested in every 
detail that Magellan uncovers, but with the gather command, you can pick and 
choose. When you're done, you'll have a new file with just the information you 
need. 
</P>
<P>
If you're lost in a sea of data, then you need the help of an experienced 
explorer such as Magellan. Lotus Development has given the program a suggested 
retail price of $195 but is offering it at an introductory price of $139 until 
the end of June.

<P>
A disk organizing program that allows you to find, view and organize 
information on your hard disk. The program displays the contents of a file 
without having to run the program that created it. A find feature quickly 
locates files based on any word or phrase in the file. You also can use the 
program to create groups of related files and to access these groups through a 
menu. Magellan can be used to launch other programs and to rename, copy, move 
or delete files and directories of files. Magellan works with files from a wide 
variety of word processors, spreadsheets, database management systems and other 
programs.

Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board 
of Trade, with wheat prices up strongly following the White House announcement 
of additional subsidized grain sales to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, cotton prices rose, energy futures were mostly higher, 
livestock futures were up and pork futures were mixed. Precious metals also 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 1 cent to 11 cents higher, with the contract for May delivery at 
$4.37 1/2 a bushel; corn was 1/2 cent to 2 1/2 cents higher, with May at $2.76 
a bushel; oats were 1/2 cent to 2 3/4 cents higher, with May at $1.87 cents a 
bushel, and soybeans were 6 cents to 12 3/4 cents higher, with May at $7.46 3/4 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat opened lower at the start of trading, surprising a market that expected a 
strong start for wheat futures. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of people who thought the Russian business was already 
reflected in prices," said Rich Feltes, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago. 
"Today's action showed that any kind of business outside the United States will 
be positive" for the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration announced Tuesday that the United States will sell 1.5 
million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union under the export bonus 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton futures prices rose sharply on New York's Cotton Exchange on reports of 
severe damage to the Soviet Union's cotton crop. 
</P>
<P>
The rally also was stimulated by commission house and local buying, said Ernest 
Simon, a cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency Tass reported that the Central Asian Republic of 
Uzbekistan suffered losses in crops and livestock following four days of heavy 
rain and snow. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton settled 1.04 cents to 1.33 cents higher, with May at 66.33 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures were mostly higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange as 
gasoline prices came under pressure in the wake of an American Petroleum 
Institute report of increased imports. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 30 cents to 49 cents higher, with June at 
$20.10 a barrel; heating oil was 1.34 cents lower to 0.41 cent higher, with 
June at 47.86 a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 1.86 cents lower to 0.89 cent 
higher, with June at 69.39 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock prices were higher and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange.

SOME JAPANESE GOODS MAY GET 100% TARIFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House on Wednesday published a list of more than 50 Japanese products 
that might be candidates for 100% tariffs later this year if the United States 
retaliates against Japan for failing to comply with a longstanding pact on 
trade in telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The list includes some $900 million worth of Japanese telecommunications 
products and $600 million worth of other Japanese-made goods, ranging from 
facsimile machines and cordless telephones to laser beams and specialized 
semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
The early notice, to be published in today's Federal Register, is designed to 
warn Japan of the kinds of products that U.S. officials will consider when they 
make up the final list of items to be selected for retaliatory tariffs or other 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanctions Aren't Certain 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials published a similar lengthy list of potential candidates for 
retaliation before imposing sanctions on Japan in 1987 for Japan's alleged 
violation of a previous year's accord on trade in semiconductors. The actual 
sanctions then amounted only to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said Wednesday that they had not yet estimated how much 
business U.S. exporters may have lost as a result of Japan's failure to comply 
with the pact on telecommunications equipment -- the figure on which the White 
House traditionally bases the size of any sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office has scheduled a formal hearing 
on the issue for May 24. Officials conceded that the total is likely to be well 
below the $1.5 billion worth of products contained in Wednesday's lists. 
</P>
<P>
It still is not certain that the Administration will impose such sanctions. The 
U.S. Trade Representative's Office announced Friday that it had decided to cite 
Japan formally for failure to live up to the telecommunications accord -- a 
step required under the 1988 Trade Act. 
</P>
<P>
But Japan still has up to six months to meet U.S. demands that it come into 
compliance with the agreement, and its trade officials are expected to launch 
negotiations soon to try to settle the issue before sanctions are imposed. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. charges of violations affect two specific products -- U.S.-made 
cellular telephones and mobile car radios. In both cases, Washington alleges 
that Tokyo has restricted their use by refusing to license radio operations and 
allocate frequencies that the products could use in some sections of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Both products are major exports of Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg, Ill., which 
raised the issue initially that led to negotiation of the original 
telecommunications accord. Motorola officials have maintained that the 
restrictions bar them from the country's most lucrative markets. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that, just as in the case involving trade in semiconductors 
a few years ago, they must be careful to choose products for retaliation whose 
restriction will not hurt American producers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, imposing high tariffs on Japanese-made laser products could impose 
a hardship on U.S. manufacturers of machine tools and medical equipment. The 
hearing scheduled for May 24 is intended to uncover some of those potential 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action Wednesday, the trade representative's office announced 
that it had worked out an agreement with the European Community on an interim 
procedure for allowing some U.S.-produced beef into European markets, despite 
the EC's ban on growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure provides for allowing U.S. producers who want to export 
hormone-free beef to Europe to sign a private contract with European officials 
under which they agree to meet European requirements. In return, the EC will 
arrange to monitor those cattle. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials cautioned that the accord will affect only a minuscule part 
of potential U.S. beef exports to Europe and will not resolve the larger 
dispute over whether the European ban on hormone-treated beef is justified. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Washington is maintaining the 100% tariffs, or extra duties, that 
the Administration imposed Jan. 1 on some $96 million in European meat 
shipments to the United States. The two sides also agreed to continue their 
negotiations indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the facsimile machines and cordless telephones, the list of potential 
candidates for retaliation in the Japanese telecommunications case included 
automatic data-processing machines, optical readers and chemicals such as 
aluminum nitride and silicides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phone Fees Possible 
</P>
<P>
Also listed were industrial robots, carpet sweepers, ultrasonic welding 
machines, die-bonding assembling equipment, telephone switching equipment, 
microphones and loudspeakers, tape recorders, paging devices, radar detectors, 
burglar alarm parts, diodes, photovoltaic cells, wire, cable, station wagons, 
helicopters, propellers and rotors, optical fibers, photocopiers, oscilloscopes 
and microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
The list also raises the possibility of imposing fees on telecommunications 
services such as general telephone transmission services, submarine cable 
facilities, private radio services and electronic mail, code and voice mail.

EC REPORT CALLS U.S. TRADE ACT DISCRIMINATORY

<P>
The European Community Commission on Wednesday released its 1989 report on U.S. 
trade barriers, singling out 42 regulations and trade practices that it said 
impedes imports from the 12 EC nations. 
</P>
<P>
The barriers include quantitative restrictions, export subsidies, customs 
barriers, public procurement policies, countervailing duties, anti-dumping 
procedures and tax policies, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Its release came a day after the Bush Administration released its report on 
foreign trade practices that it considers unfair. 
</P>
<P>
EC Commission spokesman Claus Ehlermann said the timing of the release of the 
EC report was not linked to the U.S. report. He said the EC report was an 
annual event and its release simply "coincided" with the report by the Office 
of the U.S. Special Trade Representative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Permanent Discrimination' 
</P>
<P>
The EC report criticized the 1988 U.S. Fair Trade Practices Act, which it said 
will "make it more likely that unilateral action will be taken to redress 
allegedly unfair trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Such unilateral action . . . without authorization from the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
The report also cited the "Buy American" provision of the U.S. Trade Act that 
"has created permanent discrimination in favor of U.S. products." 
</P>
<P>
The clause provides for action by the Bush Administration against foreign 
countries that discriminate against U.S. products or services in government 
procurement, including a ban against "offending" countries. 
</P>

CAMPEAU FILES COMPLAINT OVER SALES PRICE OF UNITS SOLD TO MAY

Campeau Corp. said Wednesday that it has filed a complaint against May 
Department Stores Co. over a disagreement related to May's purchase of Filene's 
and Foley's from Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. division. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed by Campeau and Federated in U.S. District Court in New 
York, seeks a judgment on whether the purchase agreement between the retailers 
provides for certain adjustments in the amount of money May paid for 
Boston-based Filene's and Houston-based Foley's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau, a Toronto company that has real estate and retail holdings including 
strings of department stores in the United States, said the amount of the 
adjustments in dispute is about $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau said May has until May 18 to respond to the complaint, which was 
disclosed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was filed 
in the Manhattan court April 20. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at May's headquarters in St. Louis said the company was 
disappointed that Campeau and Federated filed the complaint instead of seeking 
a solution to their disagreement through arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
"We previously advised Campeau of the need for arbitration of our mutual 
disagreements in the purchase price adjustments both for the Foley's and 
Filene's transactions," the spokesman said.

A BRUSH WITH RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's fire season began early this year -- it was declared 
Monday by state fire and forestry officials. That means it's time to ensure 
that hazardous brush, trees and other vegetation on your property have been cut 
back as legally required. 
</P>
<P>
From Ventura County to San Diego County, owners of hundreds of thousands of 
mountain and hillside homes have received notices from city and county fire 
departments to clear brush. Others will be getting notices through June 2. 
</P>
<P>
Don't ignore the notices, fire department officials advise, because the home 
you save with proper clearance work may be your own. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't do the work yourself, hire a reputable contractor. Most give free 
estimates. Their fees depend on the lot size and the difficulty of removing the 
brush. Steep hillside lots cost more. 
</P>
<P>
The costs may range from $50 to several thousand dollars, said Don Sitts, a Los 
Angeles City Fire Department inspector who works with the brush clearance unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspections Started 
</P>
<P>
Many fire departments started house-to-house inspections this week; weed 
abatement programs and inspections continue in rugged hillside areas, whether 
the property has a structure on it or is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had the same problem for the last few years, very little moisture this 
spring," said Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Gary Oversby. "So the grass is 
curing quicker and dead grass will not green up, so it has to be cleared. But, 
it's a Catch-22 situation. If we get rain, there'll be more grass to dry out. 
If we don't, then the trees dry out and that increases the dead fuel." 
</P>
<P>
If you're concerned about which vegetations pose dangers, most fire departments 
or the California Department of Forestry can provide brochures describing safe 
plants and bushes and those that are hazardous. Among the most dangerous are 
those with high oil content, such as chamise or greasewood, and California 
buckwheat. 
</P>
<P>
State fire regulations require clearance of flammable vegetation for at least 
30 feet from any structure in a hazardous area. Cut back natural vegetation to 
18 inches in height for another 70 feet. Remove tree limbs within 10 feet of a 
chimney opening and ensure that the opening is covered with a half-inch wire 
mesh spark arrester. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stricter Rules 
</P>
<P>
For properties in more remote canyon areas, fire officials also can insist that 
owners cut back grass to 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities and counties have even more stringent rules. Los Angeles, for 
instance, requires that grass and weeds be cut to 3 inches in height and tree 
branches be trimmed from ground level to a height of 5 feet in dangerous fire 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the city Fire Department instituted a brush task force of 55 specially 
trained firefighters who inspect properties citywide, about 110,000 parcels 
each year in the Mountain Fire District and the buffer zone near it. 
</P>
<P>
If task force teams inspect your neighborhood and you haven't cleared properly, 
they will issue a noncompliance notice and give you a deadline to complete 
work. They also post a bright orange copy of the notice on your property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Maintained Plants OK 
</P>
<P>
But before you rush to cut down your bougainvillea, be advised that "these 
requirements do not normally apply to a live, well-maintained and irrigated 
domestic landscape from which all dead materials are removed," fire officials 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Fire Department has a similar basic brush clearance 
program; its inspections are handled by the 128 county engine companies and in 
the 47 cities that the county contracts with for fire protection. Its weed 
abatement crews also do brush clearing and prescribed vegetation burns in 
selected areas. 
</P>
<P>
If you haven't cleared the property when it's inspected, you will get a notice 
to do so. If you continue to ignore the notice, the county can issue you a 
citation. That's when it starts to cost money. Fines can go from $50 for a 
first citation to $500 for the fourth; further citations are misdemeanors, 
costing $500 each. You also can end up fighting with the district attorney in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting more teeth in the laws," Oversby of the county said. "So it 
costs them a little bit more than time now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May End Up in Court 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Fire Department, which last year issued 506 citations to 
homeowners for ignoring notices, also may drag you into court if you fail to 
comply with brush clearance rules, as will San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"We give them three shots to comply, then we take them to court," said Kevin 
Turner, the Orange County department's wild land specialist and fire defense 
planner. "They get a fine and are put on probation for the next year." 
</P>
<P>
In most instances, if you fail to comply with the rules in a timely manner -- 
each jurisdiction has different deadlines -- you will end up spending much more 
money than if you had done what you were supposed to do. There are appeals -- 
to fire board commissioners or county supervisors -- but they're 
time-consuming, and if you lose, you must pay the clearance bills and fees 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
If you wait until local agencies send in crews to clear your property, you may 
end up paying an administrative service charge, besides contractor fees. The 
extra charges vary widely, depending on where you live. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sampling of Fees 
</P>
<P>
The administrative fee, beside contractor charges, for the Los Angeles City 
Fire Department is $250; the Orange County Fire Department charges $233; 
Ventura County, $221; Los Angeles County, $70; San Diego County does not charge 
the added fee. 
</P>
<P>
In some counties and municipalities, you can pay the fees and charges 
separately, but in most cases, they get tacked on as a special assessment to 
your next year's property taxes. If they're unpaid, they become a property 
lien, a potential block on your later ability to later sell your holdings. 
</P>
<P>
If property is in escrow, sellers must clear the brush and assume the expense, 
Los Angeles city fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire departments decline to endorse private brush clearing contractors. But the 
Los Angeles City Fire Department, for example, provides a list of 32 
contractors operating citywide "as a convenience for property owners." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poison Oak a Special Case 
</P>
<P>
If you have a lot of poison oak on your property, you must find a contractor 
who specializes in removing it, Los Angeles City firefighter Vince Marzo said. 
"Only certain contractors will handle that," he explained, noting that you can 
get a list of contractors at the local fire station or check in the telephone 
directory under lot cleaners, landscapers or gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go out of my way to take poison oak jobs," said Courtney Kite of Kite 
Weed Control, a Pasadena brush clearance contractor for 17 years who does work 
for homeowners as well as contracting jobs for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners seeking reputable contractors should ask for references. They also 
should ensure the contractor is experienced in the work and knows the local 
fire regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people look for the (good) price," Kite said, "but quality work should 
have a little more consideration. Some contractors are so inexperienced they'll 
clear weeds to the bare ground and that's not good, because then you can have a 
soil erosion problem." 
</P>
<P>
Kite also noted that homeowners may wish to check whether a contractor carries 
liability insurance and workers' compensation for employees because the work 
can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Notice System 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, where the Fire Department requires clearance 100 feet from a 
structure, Battalion Chief Dick Perry said his agency is experimenting with a 
new system of sending out notices. 
</P>
<P>
They will go in three mailings to different areas; Simi Valley, Moorpark and 
Thousand Oaks residents, for example, got the first notices on April 10 and 
have until Tuesday to comply. 
</P>
<P>
Perry explained that firefighters don't necessarily enjoy the chore of 
enforcing brush clearing rules, any more than property owners like complying 
with the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We're wearing a hat we usually don't wear," he said. "It's one of the few 
things we do of an enforcement nature and it upsets some people. We probably 
have as aggressive a program as they have anywhere in the state. But it's for 
the protection of the people."

Former California Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, who as a tough district attorney 
oversaw the prosecution of Charles Manson and Robert F. Kennedy assassin Sirhan 
Sirhan, was found dead in his Hollywood Hills home today. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to Younger's home on Thrasher Avenue at 8:30 a.m. and 
officers found him dead of what appeared to be natural causes, Officer Bill 
Frio said. 
</P>
<P>
Younger's wife, Mildred, and son, Superior Court Judge Eric Younger, were at 
home when he died. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his public service careers as California's and Los Angeles County's 
top prosecutor, Younger was a Municipal and Superior Court judge. In 1978, he 
was an unsuccessful Republican candidate against Gov. Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
He was appointed to the Superior Court bench in 1958 and became Los Angeles 
district attorney in 1964. He was California attorney general from 1970 to 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
When he lost to Brown he had been in public service for 37 years, 25 of which 
were in elected office.

CHINA STUDENTS STAGE ANOTHER HUGE RALLY

Legions of students marched through Beijing today and occupied Tian An Men 
Square to mark the 70th anniversary of China's first student movement with 
another stunning display of their craving for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 people, more than half of them students, defied police and 
peacefully gathered in the huge square for a festive rally to seek greater 
freedom, cleaner government, a free press and official recognition of the new 
independent student union that authorities say is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Students held much smaller demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing and Changsha, 
and about 300 journalists from the official Chinese media joined the student 
rally in Tian An Men. Throughout Beijing, crowds of workers applauded the 
students and shouted encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'China Has Hope' 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the march will not bring democracy today, tomorrow or the day after 
tomorrow, but if we keep working on it, China has hope," said one worker who 
claimed that he risked being fired by attending the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
After initially saying the student marches were designed to undermine China's 
government, the communist leadership in recent days has said that the 
demonstrators are being manipulated by unspecified people and that most 
protesting students are patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
Student activists appeared ready today to shift their tactics. After six 
successful marches in defiance of the government, they indicated that future 
activity may not center on demonstrations. They also announced that a nearly 
2-week-old boycott that shut down most Beijing University classes would end 
Friday.

Gov. George Deukmejian, a strong Republican supporter of President Bush in last 
year's presidential campaign, has complained to White House Chief of Staff John 
H. Sununu about the planning for the President's recent trip to California, it 
was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Citing informed sources, the Washington Post said Deukmejian sent a letter to 
Sununu expressing his unhappiness with the failure of the White House staff to 
schedule time for him to meet with Bush while the President was in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, for a time among those being considered as a running mate for Bush, 
also complained to Sununu that the White House failed to consult with him on 
what themes and events should dominate the visit until the schedule was already 
set, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent two nights in California during his four-day cross-country tour last 
week. But Bush did not see Deukmejian, although he was accompanied by 
Republican members of Congress. Bush gave speeches on high technology in Palo 
Alto, visited a ranch seized from drug traffickers in Orange County, spoke 
briefly to Latinos, attended a baseball game and met with former President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a Republican source as describing Deukmejian's letter as 
"having a polite, respectful tone, but the message was clear: We are not 
pleased. This is no way to run a railroad."

An international conference today agreed to safeguard company secrets on 
production of chemicals that harm the ozone layer, despite objections from 
environmentalist groups. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate secrecy issue caused fiery debate at the U.N.-sponsored meeting 
reviewing the 1987 Montreal Protocol. The Montreal agreement, ratified by 36 
countries, pledges drastic cuts in the production and use of 
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are blamed for breaking down the ozone 
layer. 
</P>
<P>
The secrecy resolution, put forward by the United States and the 12 nations of 
the European Economic Community, won unanimous approval, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace delegate Karen Coulter said the environmental group feared that 
greater secrecy could help countries hide the production of banned chemicals. 
Under the Montreal Protocol, the signatory nations must report to the U.N. 
Environmental Program on the production, consumption and trade in five 
chlorofluorocarbons and three halon gases.

WAYS SOUGHT TO EXTEND V-22 TILT-ROTOR WORK 
</P>

A top defense official said today the Pentagon is studying ways to grant at 
least a temporary reprieve to the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor program, which might 
avert threatened layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood, making his first Capitol Hill 
appearance since getting the No. 2 job at the Pentagon, told the Senate 
Appropriations defense subcommittee that two options are being examined and a 
decision should come "in a day or so." 
</P>
<P>
Atwood was peppered with questions about the program widely supported in 
Congress but canceled by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as part of $10 billion 
in budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been looking at several alternatives," Atwood told Sen. Arlen Specter 
(R-Pa.), whose state is home to Boeing Vertol, a partner in the project with 
Bell Helicopter Textron of Ft. Worth. Bell has said work on the V-22 will stop 
Friday and has warned 8,000 employees that if nothing happens layoffs will 
start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Specter told Atwood it would be expensive to halt the work now and then restart 
it in fiscal 1990 if Congress revives the plane and asked Atwood to "explore 
the possibility of maintaining enough effort to keep Bell in operation, 
maintain the status quo while this is evaluated by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we would encourage them (Bell) to continue and not break the 
contract," said Atwood, noting that all Pentagon funds for the project in 1989 
have been spent and if Bell stops work on the plane the contract will be 
broken. Without additional tax dollars, Bell must spend its own money to keep 
work going. If the Pentagon shifted more money to the work, key congressional 
committees would have to give their permission. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood said among the options being examined were continuing the project 
"through some flight test program" or through "some kind of very minimal effort 
of technology demonstration." 
</P>
<P>
The plane has engine pods at the end of the wings with large propellers. The 
pods can rotate from horizontal for plane-like flight to vertical for 
helicopter-like takeoffs and landings. It is intended to haul Marines and 
supplies up to 200 miles from offshore boats to landing points, and the Army 
also is interested in the project. About $2.5 billion already has been invested 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood said the program was canceled for purely budgetary reasons, not because 
of any problem with the aircraft just now reaching the production stage or 
because of any qualms about its capabilities.

MOST PESTICIDE EXPORTS UNTRACKED

The government has skimpy rules for tracking the export of pesticides that are 
barred from use in the United States and informing the recipient nations of the 
shipments, a congressional report said today. 
</P>
<P>
The report, written by the General Accounting Office, said the rules now in 
effect "exempt the majority of unregistered pesticide exports from the notice 
requirement" on the grounds that they are similar to chemicals that are 
registered for use domestically. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) said foreign governments "are not being notified 
about 90% of the unregistered pesticides exported from this country." Synar and 
the GAO report pointed to the possibility that the lack of information about 
where the pesticides were being used could hamper detection of harmful residues 
in food imported by U.S. firms.

TAX FREEDOM DAY MARKS THE END OF UNCLE SAM'S CUT

Tax Freedom Day for 1989 arrived today, which means starting Friday an average 
American worker can keep all earnings made during the rest of this year free of 
federal, state and local government taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Tax Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, said it took 
the average American worker 124 days -- from Jan. 1 to May 4 -- to satisfy this 
year's tax obligations, assuming every dollar in the paycheck was allocated for 
the various taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the 124-day tax bite period has remained unchanged in the 
last three years. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, in 1950 it took the average worker only until April 3, or 93 
days, to satisfy the tax obligations. Since then the tax-bite period has grown 
steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Stated differently, the foundation said taxes will take a 2-hour, 43-minute 
bite from the worker's eight-hour earnings in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation report said the total tax bite from the workday is far ahead of 
the next most costly item, housing and household operations, which will take 
away 1 hour and 25 minutes of the wages.

he is "definitely interested in a career in professional baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"I tried out for the Braves for three days about a month ago," he said. "They

EX-COACHES PLEAD INNOCENT IN DRUG CASE; 
</P>
<P>
ACCUSED IN PROBE OF ALLEGED STEROID USE BY S. CAROLINA ATHLETES

Four former South Carolina football coaches were arraigned today on charges 
stemming from a probe of alleged steroid use at the university and illegal 
distribution of the drug statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The four men, who were indicted April 19 by a federal grand jury, pleaded 
innocent to the charges. U.S. Magistrate Charles Gambrell granted $10,000 
unsecured bond each and said the men, none of whom live in South Carolina, will 
be allowed to leave the state. 
</P>
<P>
Former Gamecocks coaches Jim Washburn, Tom Gadd and Tom Kurucz were indicted by 
the grand jury for "conspiring to conduct a program of illegal steroid use by 
members of the athletic community . . . particularly by members of the 
university's football team." Former players and coaches allegedly used 
steroids, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Washburn, Gadd and Kurucz were also charged with importing steroids into the 
state and dispensing the drugs without a prescription. Kurucz is also charged 
with lying to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Former Gamecocks strength coach Keith Kephart was charged with conspiring with 
others in the university's "athletic community" to bring steroids into the 
state and dispense them without prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Kephart declined comment after the court hearing. Before his arraignment, he 
said he would not discuss the case until it was settled. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's been trying," he said. "That's why I'm anxious to get it 
settled." 
</P>
<P>
John Carter of Bethesda, Md., was indicted on charges he distributed steroids 
to four former Gamecocks' players, including Tommy Chaikin. He was scheduled to 
be arraigned later today. 
</P>
<P>
It was Chaikin's article in Sports Illustrated on Oct. 24 detailing alleged 
steroid and drug use by football players that prompted the grand jury probe. 
</P>
<P>
A trial date has tentatively been set for June 6.
