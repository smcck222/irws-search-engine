NEWSMAKERS: IN ARRESTING MOVE, SCHOOL'S BOARD DROPS KHASHOGGI 
</P>

Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi has been dropped from the American University 
Board of Trustees -- not because of his indictment on charges of racketeering, 
fraud and obstruction of justice -- but because he is a no-show. Khashoggi, 
once reputed to have been among the world's richest men, was named to the 
Washington school's board in 1983 but, according to AU President Richard 
Berendzen, has attended only one board meeting, staying about 30 minutes. "We 
have no address for him," Berendzen told the Eagle, the AU student newspaper. 
It is true that for a time after the indictment was issued Khashoggi was a 
fugitive, traveling frequently through Europe and the Middle East. However, his 
current address is Bern, Switzerland, where he was jailed last month for 
extradition to the United States to face charges that he helped Ferdinand E. 
Marcos funnel millions of dollars out of the Philippines when he was president 
to buy paintings and real estate in New York. Meanwhile, a column in the AU 
student paper called for the university to drop Khashoggi's name from its new 
sports complex, calling it an "embarrassment." Khashoggi pledged $5 million to 
the facility in 1984.

 -- No more free rides at Chicago City Hall. Mayor Richard M. Daley, who took 
office just over a week ago, ordered all cars parked illegally outside City 
Hall towed away, including those of five city officials. Daley's press 
secretary, Avis LaVelle, said that to set an example, Daley ordered his 
limousine parked in the city's underground lot. Normally, the vehicle idles 
outside City Hall. Will Daley make the tow order a daily occurrence? "Oh, I 
think people will get the message," LaVelle said. She should know. Hers was one 
of the cars towed.

 -- FBI headquarters was paid a visit by an unlikely group of tourists -- 12 
retired Soviet admirals and generals. The former top Soviet military officers, 
in the United States for a conference sponsored by a private defense group, saw 
FBI exhibits on fingerprinting, its famous crime laboratory and a firearms 
demonstration. But perhaps of greatest interest to the group was a display 
showing various Soviet spies captured in recent years and one in particular 
entitled "The Walker Family," the spy ring broken up by the FBI and 
masterminded by former Navy communications specialist John A. Walker Jr. He 
pleaded guilty to selling some of the nation's most vital secrets to Moscow for 
nearly two decades. DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN

SERGE HOVEY; MUSICOLOGIST, BURNS EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Serge Hovey, a composer and musicologist whose devotion to the poetry and song 
of Robert Burns seemingly enabled him to overcome for years the devastating 
debilitation of Lou Gehrig's disease, died Wednesday evening at his home in 
Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Esther, said her husband was 69 and had just recently compiled and 
completed the sixth recorded volume of Burns' music while planning for a 
seventh album later this month. 
</P>
<P>
He had been diagnosed more than 20 years ago with having amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, a crippling neurological disorder. Doctors at the time gave him only 
two to three years to live. 
</P>
<P>
But Hovey credited his fascination with what he called "the folk tradition in 
music" for the strength that enabled him to continue his labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Project 
</P>
<P>
He already was a successful composer when he embarked on the massive Burns 
project that was to dominate the last years of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Hovey had been a composition student of Arnold Schoenberg and Hanns Eisler and 
had written the scores for the New York shows "Tevya and His Daughters" and 
"The World of Scholem Aleichem." He had also been musical director of Bertolt 
Brecht's "Galileo." 
</P>
<P>
His other works -- film scores, choral pieces, operas and chamber music -- have 
been performed by ensembles throughout the United States and in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
He was the son of a New England father and a Russian-Jewish mother. At 
mid-life, he began seeking his own roots. In the 1960s, that research into folk 
lore led him to Burns. 
</P>
<P>
"Burns wrote several hundred poems and 323 lyrics," Hovey said in a 
wide-ranging interview with The Times in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"As I read, I would find underneath the title of the lyric, 'Tune: So-and-so,' 
" Hovey elaborated. "Under 'A Red, Red Rose,' it said: 'Tune: Major Graham.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hovey set out to find what was "Major Graham?" 
</P>
<P>
He soon found out that no one knew, and that if there was to be an authority, 
he would be it. 
</P>
<P>
Trips to Scotland located a few songs in the National Library in Edinburgh, 
which in turn led to others. He located published books containing melodies 
that Burns had used himself. Following as he could Burns' instructions, he 
matched each lyric to a tune. (Even the bawdy ones that the poet was fond of 
writing, either after or before he had done an acceptable version.) 
</P>
<P>
Hovey even found that the world had been singing "Auld Lang Syne," a lyric 
Burns wrote in 1799, to a melody the poet had never intended. 
</P>
<P>
The song that symbolizes the New Year to much of the English-speaking world was 
"carelessly selected" after Burns' death. Hovey published the lyric and the 
unknown melody Burns had intended for it in Volume 2 of "The Robert Burns 
Songbook." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, one of Hovey's four sons, Daniel, went to Scotland and with a 
string quartet and recorded the sixth volume. The seventh is due in the 
recording studio late this month, Esther Hovey said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife and sons, Hovey is survived by six grandchildren and a 
sister. Services will be private.

WHAT EXACTLY DOES ARAFAT MEAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's clear enough what Yasser Arafat said in Paris, but what exactly did he 
mean? Asked by a French interviewer how the Palestine National Covenant's call 
for the elimination of "the Zionist presence" squares with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization's current claim that it is ready to coexist peacefully 
with Israel, the PLO chairman described the covenant as "caduc," a French word 
his official hosts later acknowledged they suggested. In the context in which 
the question was put, that word means "null and void." But is that, in fact, 
what Arafat intended to convey? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently not. The day after the interview Arafat and his aides insisted, in 
English, that he was only trying to suggest that the covenant, approved by the 
Palestine National Council in 1964 and rewritten in 1968, has been "superseded" 
by political declarations made by the PLO late last year. Now supersede means 
to set something aside, while null and void means that something is invalid, a 
dead letter, without legal force. The distinction is a definite one, and 
because of what the covenant says and its significance for the PLO, that 
distinction is of more than casual semantic and political importance. 
</P>
<P>
Taken at face value, which is the way all political charters deserve to be 
taken, the covenant absolutely rules out the chance that the Palestine that 
existed until 1948 under the British Mandate can be divided between a state of 
Israel and a Palestinian state, or that Palestinian and Israeli states could 
peacefully coexist alongside each other. The language is unambiguous: Palestine 
is "an indivisible territorial unit . . . Armed struggle is the only way to 
liberate Palestine . . . and to eliminate the Zionist presence . . . The 
partitioning of Palestine in 1947 and the establishment of Israel are 
fundamentally null and void . . . " and so on. The covenant, in short, 
represents something less than a departure point for good-faith negotiations. 
On the contrary, it is a monumental impediment. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the United States, France and other countries have been urging the 
PLO to amend or abrogate the covenant. The PLO, whether its leaders acknowledge 
it or not, has a major credibility problem. It says it is ready to reach a 
political settlement with Israel that provides for mutual respect for 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. But it remains bound to a charter that 
explicitly rejects any such possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his supporters claim that recent PLO resolutions and statements take 
precedence over the covenant, but saying that they also stop short of 
repudiating its call for Israel's extinction. Arafat implies that his words of 
today should be seen as having greater value and relevance than the solemn 
document that has guided the PLO for a quarter-century. He says he can be 
trusted because he was chosen to speak for the PLO by a democratic vote of the 
Palestine National Council. But that same council long ago determined that the 
National Covenant can be amended -- or superseded, or made null and void -- 
only by a two-thirds vote, and not just on one man's retractable say-so. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat in Paris did little to clarify the PLO's position or advance its 
political program. On the contrary, between saying one thing in French one 
night and something quite different in English just hours later, and then 
flatly refusing to clear up the contradiction, he only made the issue of the 
PLO's willingness to coexist peacefully with Israel murkier, and his own 
penchant for deviousness more pronounced. Does the Palestine National Covenant 
mean what it says, or does it not? Arafat typically has done nothing to clarify 
that fundamental question. Instead, once again, he opted for semantic sleight 
of hand over substance.

'NOW THAT RED IS DEAD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My question to Thomas Powers and the "red is dead" tradition ("What Next Now 
That Red Is Dead?" Opinion, April 23) is why does a dead movement have to die 
so many deaths? According to the Powers' heritage of journalistic analysis, 
socialism died with either the Paris Commune, Karl Marx, the Second 
International, Lenin's New Economic Policy, Stalinist dictatorship, 
intellectual disillusion in the West, "the end of ideology" theory, or now, 
Mikhail Gorbachev's democratic reforms. Take your pick. There's abundant 
precedent for all. 
</P>
<P>
But then the Powers' tradition has never been about foreign events; it's been 
about popular attitudes at home. Powers even makes the point clear in a 
revealing sign-off statement. Like it or not, his obituary on socialism 
concludes, the American people have no alternative to the continued reign of 
Reagan-Thatcherism. 
</P>
<P>
So there it is, the article's real message. An Exxon dumps all over land, sea, 
and air, then thumbs its nose in true Reaganesque fashion. The Powers' message 
to an agonized American public -- don't even think expropriation, because 
expropriation equals dead socialism. Public monies continue to buy out private 
bank failures. The Powers' message to a confused American public -- don't even 
think you've purchased something, because public ownership equals dead 
socialism. The dwindling American voter stands before a paralyzed electoral 
system and sees one party where there's supposed to be two. Same message, same 
result. 
</P>
<P>
Really, Thomas Powers has earned a bonus from his employers for telling the 
American people they have no alternative to corporate rip-off as usual. He's 
done his job for them in true workman-like fashion. There's a pithy saying 
somewhere in Marx for the kind of service Powers and his historical brethren 
provide. But I think we get the idea anyway.

<P>
Powers is either blind, ignorant, or making a joke. Or, hopefully, he's a 
wishful thinker? 
</P>
<P>
"It is over. The left is dead," claims Powers. Oh, really? I must have missed 
something. The Times must have forgotten to print the news that all religious 
and political prisoners have been released. The asylums in Russia having 
released all their "insane" religious objectors somehow escaped the world's 
press. The people of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, North Vietnam, et al are 
such fools as to have missed this wonderful news. 
</P>
<P>
Using such statements as "the left was skilled at capturing the moral high 
ground . . . as the party of peace . . . inspired lofty ideals," I believe Mr. 
Powers identifies his leanings. 
</P>
<P>
But it is insulting to us conservative Americans to think for one minute that 
we would swallow such dishonest drivel. Even our liberal fellows must smile at 
Mr. Powers' naivete.

OUR ENERGY DEBATE CAN'T RUN ON EMOTION; 
</P>
<P>
IF WE WANT ALTERNATIVES, WE MUST KNOW RISKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Like all industrialized nations, America runs on energy. An adequate supply at 
a reasonable cost is essential if this nation is to maintain or improve its 
current standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
But energy, every form of it, has its price. Some costs are readily apparent. 
One can calculate, based on the price of oil or coal, the cost per kilowatt of 
electricity generated. Other costs are more difficult to calculate. For 
example, the cost per kilowatt of electricity generated via nuclear energy 
(fission) reflects less the cost of uranium than the need to comply with 
complex and often expensive environmental safety regulations. In so far as 
these measures are reasonable, they present an unavoidable expenditure. 
However, regulations motivated by politics and/or emotion -- rather than 
science -- are an unnecessary expense. Finally, we need to consider some energy 
costs that are exceedingly difficult or impossible to estimate, such as the 
effect of these technologies on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Europe and Japan, with about 20% of the world's population, 
consume 80% of the world's energy. This disproportionate use of energy cannot 
continue into the next century. As other nations evolve, they too will require 
(and demand) their fair share of the world's energy resources. What will happen 
then? One strategy could be for us to voluntarily decrease our energy 
consumption. This seems exceedingly unlikely. Americans continue to use more, 
not less, energy each year. Another possibility is a violent social upheaval 
whereby these nations seize their "fair-share" of the world's energy resources. 
Clearly this is not in our best interest. The third alternative is to increase 
energy production. Few question that this strategy will prevail, but where will 
this energy come from? 
</P>
<P>
Coal is abundant and cheap. However, coal mining is dangerous and its burning 
poses very substantial health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Oil, too, has many problems. It is a scarce resource and we depend heavily on 
foreign supplies. This reliance can have profound economic and political 
consequences. My greatest concerns, however, are the political costs of oil 
dependence. It did not require many hours of waiting in line during the 1973 
oil crisis for many Americans to begin to question our support of Israel. And 
what about the nuclear risk of foreign oil dependence? It is possible to argue 
that the likelihood of a conflict escalating into a major nuclear exchange is 
greater if fought over the use of oil than over the use of nuclear energy. 
</P>
<P>
Other forms of energy also must be considered, but some, such as hydroelectric 
or wind, are inadequate for global needs. Solar energy is a popular 
alternative. However, it is also currently inadequate, and present technologies 
result in a loss of lives and production of toxic wastes of comparable or 
greater magnitude as nuclear energy. Recent reports of a breakthrough in the 
cold fusion process of producing energy are of interest, but fusion is 
inherently more unstable than fission and practical applications are at best 
decades away. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, should we think of nuclear energy? It, too, has substantial 
advantages and problems. It is potentially abundant. It could be cheap but 
isn't, primarily because of errors made by the industry and by regulatory 
agencies. Nuclear energy also carries the risk of accidents, like Chernobyl, 
and disposal of radioactive wastes. These problems should be technically 
solvable but are too heavily politicized for serious progress. 
</P>
<P>
This brings us to two recent issues. One is the defeat of a Los Angeles 
proposition by Occidental Petroleum to drill for oil in California; the second, 
the planned dismantling of the newly licensed Shoreham nuclear power station in 
New York. Americans must be willing to pay the price for energy. If we stop 
using nuclear energy, we must accept the risks of oil exploration or changes in 
the environment of the planet that may result from burning fossil fuels. We 
must understand that simply voting against every energy proposal will not 
result in a sensible energy strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Many people were surprised when George Bush, during the second presidential 
campaign debate, mentioned that he thought safe nuclear energy might have a 
role in the nation's energy future. However, this seems to me a reasonable 
attitude. In contrast, I do not agree with recent decisions regarding the 
Shoreham reactor or the Seabrook nuclear facility in New Hampshire. These 
decisions seem to have been motivated more by political considerations or 
naivete than by a scholarly assessment of the potential risks. For example, 
while it is probably true that Long Island or Boston could not be rapidly 
evacuated, it is also clear that no possible accident scenario would make such 
an evacuation desirable. Also, consider that at Chernobyl, for which the 
Soviets were totally unprepared, evacuation of the local town of 45,000 persons 
was accomplished in four hours, once the decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to get serious about energy. The United States has drifted for too 
long without a cogent, long-term energy policy. I am not necessarily suggesting 
people support offshore oil drilling (a crazy stance just after the Exxon 
Valdez fiasco) or more nuclear power plants. But they should think carefully 
about the alternatives. If the Bush Administration is to be successful in 
developing a comprehensive energy policy that will serve the United States into 
the next century, it will need the support of an informed, rational electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Although crudites and sushi are popular today, I doubt Americans will be happy 
with less energy.

THE PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY THE PIPER, SO A SAY ON GAS TAX HIKE IS JUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL FOX, Joel Fox is president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian says the people should vote on any gas-tax increase. 
He's right. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the legislative leaders and business people who attended the governor's 
summit on transportation believe the legislators would probably pass a higher 
gas-tax increase than the people would approve. Polls have shown that the 
people will probably accept a 3-cent increase, perhaps even 5. The argument 
goes that we need more than that to save and improve the transportation system, 
so since the people won't give it to us, we'll work around them. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, increasing a statewide tax is the Legislature's job. However, a 
gas-tax increase at this time is different. There are several reasons why the 
people should vote on this tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the gas-tax increase passed, it could not be spent without a change in 
the constitutionally mandated state spending limit. Either the limit must be 
raised to accommodate the increase in gas taxes or the gas taxes must be 
declared user fees outside the spending limit. The only way an adjustment can 
be made to the spending limit is by a vote of the people. Therefore, since the 
people must make the decision on changing the limit, they should also be 
allowed to make a decision on the reason the limit is being changed. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the people had two opportunities to both change the spending limit and 
provide a boost for transportation with Propositions 71 and 72 last June. Both 
measures were defeated. Since the people have been consulted already on this 
issue, their approval should be sought again. Otherwise, it would be as if the 
government said to the people, "You didn't do what we wanted but we'll take the 
tax money from you anyway." Such an elitist attitude could only damage the 
tenuous relationship between the voters and their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, by going to the people, the pro gas-tax leaders may have a tougher 
time getting the increase they believe is necessary. They will have to do a 
good selling job, but they will have an advantage. The gas tax is different 
from a general fund tax because we know its purpose and we can be told about 
specific projects for which the revenue will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators and transportation interests will have to communicate how 
important the transportation system is, why the costs are so great and why it's 
imperative to invest in the system now to avoid collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The value of compelling a vote of the people for a gas-tax increase is that the 
legislators and interested parties will be forced into closer examination on 
how they plan to spend the people's money. Because it will be a tough sell, 
they will have to examine their programs closely; they will have to tell the 
people what improvements or repairs will be purchased with the tax money and 
they will be forced to look for ways to economize. 
</P>
<P>
Voting on statewide tax increases occurred as recently as the last statewide 
election when we voted on a cigarette tax increase of $600 million. The gas tax 
would generate twice the money and affect more people. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, of course, it will be the people who must pay the piper. Giving them a 
say is just. 
</P>
<P>
Former Gov. Hiram Johnson and his fellow California Progressives endorsed the 
motto: "The power to tax is the essence of government. The control of taxation 
is the control of government." Should not the people control the government?

MORNING BRIEFING: PRESS DIDN'T GRASP GEHRIG'S IRON STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty years ago this week, Lou Gehrig ended a remarkable string of playing in 
2,130 consecutive games, from June 1, 1925 to May 2, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, Gehrig was discovered to have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
the incurable ailment now known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
But before the world knew what ailed the New York Yankees' Iron Horse, he was 
an inviting target for sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper accounts of Gehrig's dramatic demise were at first attributed to old 
age. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Iron Horse Not What He Used to Be," said a headline in the Sporting News 
in June 1938. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter covering the Yankees for the now-defunct New York World Telegram 
wrote that the first baseman "cannot get the old swing, he cannot put the old 
driving power on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
And from the New York Times: "After all, the Iron Horse is getting old, he is 
always doing his best and it isn't exactly sporty to ride a fellow merely 
because the years have caught up with him." 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig was 35 in 1938. He died in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the first commissioner of the American Basketball Assn.? 
</P>
<P>
Food for thought: Ever wonder who came up with the idea of dragging the infield 
after the fifth inning? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it began in the Pacific Coast League in 1949, when Manager Fred Haney of 
the Hollywood Stars decided fans would buy more concessions if there was a 
10-minute break in the middle of a game. Haney came up with the brainstorm 
while pondering a suggestion from concessions chief Danny Goodman on how to 
boost business. 
</P>
<P>
Re-lighting the flame: When Seattle acquired pitcher Mike Dunne from Pittsburgh 
last week, the Mariners became the first team in the majors with three members 
of the 1984 U.S. Olympic baseball team. Dunne rejoined pitchers Scott Bankhead 
and Bill Swift. 
</P>
<P>
Now you really know Dept.: April 30's Morning Briefing said the diameter of a 
golf hole is 4 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong, writes Gerald E. Hall, rules chairman of the Southern California PGA. 
From Robert Clark's book, "Golf -- A Royal and Ancient Game," comes this 1899 
rule: "The hole shall be 4 1/4 inches in diameter, and at least 4 inches deep." 
</P>
<P>
Missed by just this much. 
</P>
<P>
Now you really know Dept. II: April 29's trivia said Dwight D. Eisenhower 
suffered a broken leg trying to tackle Jim Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kenneth S. Davis' biography, "Eisenhower, Soldier of Democracy," 
the Army football player suffered a twisted knee in the game won by Thorpe and 
Carlisle, 27-6, during the 1912 season. 
</P>
<P>
The next week, writes reader Al Ginepra, Eisenhower suffered a broken knee in a 
game against Tufts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was seriously hurt," Davis' book said. "He knew that as soon as it 
happened. The knee that he twisted in the Carlisle game was now broken, and he 
lay flat on the ground, gritting his teeth and clawing the turf in agony." 
</P>
<P>
But even in that moment of great pain Eisenhower was concerned whether he would 
be able to get back in shape for the Navy game. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't, though, since he was out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: George Mikan. 
</P>
<P>
Action Jackson: Bo Jackson receives so many accolades about his versatility 
that sometimes you've got to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
The impressive Kansas City Royal-Los Angeles Raider might have even done a 
double-take over this one: 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know how good he is?" a scout asked the Washington Post's Richard 
Justice, who then told this apocryphal anecdote: "I saw him hit a ball to deep 
center field. He ran out and caught it, then turned around and beat his own 
throw back to the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, right. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: "If Easy Goer could look me in the eye and say, 'I'm gonna win (the 
Kentucky Derby),' I wouldn't run (Awe Inspiring)," trainer Shug McGaughey said. 
"But he can't do that. He's doing fantastic, but who knows?"

 CLOTHESLINES: WEAVING OLD JACKETS INTO NEW WARDROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Question: Now that women's clothes are less mannish, what do I do with my two 
blazer jackets that have served me so well? One is a navy Anne Klein II and one 
is a beige Mary Ann Restivo. Both are in good-to-excellent condition. I'm a 
39-year-old working mother with lots of demands on my paycheck and can't afford 
to throw out good clothes. -- O.P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If you can give your jackets vest-like closings, as illustrated here, 
you'll be right in step with spring/summer fashion. The jacket in our sketch is 
Vogue 7422, in case you need a pattern. If you sew or have someone who sews for 
you, check out Very Easy Very Vogue 7335, which offers three versions of vests, 
with and without lapels. These are real, sleeveless vests, and they can be worn 
in lieu of jackets over shirts, blouses or turtlenecks or, when summer strikes, 
over nothing but skin. A lot of people in the fashion industry believe that the 
vest will replace the T-shirt this summer as the top top for hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I will graduate from college this June and go immediately to work in a law 
office. My college wardrobe is totally unsuitable, and I need advice on how to 
start building a work wardrobe. Please tell me how to start from scratch. -- 
E.M.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: If you can get by for the first week with college leftovers, wait to begin 
your new work wardrobe until you've seen what other young women in the office 
wear. Or, better yet, if your boss is a woman, follow the lead of Melanie 
Griffith in "Working Girl," who worked her way up by mimicking her boss 
(Sigourney Weaver). 
</P>
<P>
Your first major purchase should be a jacket -- one with a vest-like hemline, 
as mentioned above -- or any jacket without a collar. Cardigans look especially 
fresh right now. If you choose a fabric such as a beige washed silk, you will 
be able to wear it with any color skirt, and you'll soon find that dark skirts 
are much more practical than light ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
The jockeys of the two top horses in Saturday's Kentucky Derby are a study in 
contrasts, both on and off the track. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, the easy rider, will be aboard Easy Goer, the chocolate-colored 
powerhouse from the East and the overwhelming Derby favorite. Pat Valenzuela, 
the turmoil kid, has the assignment on Sunday Silence, the sleek black 
challenger from California and the 3-year-old given the best chance to crash 
Easy Goer's Triple Crown party. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the Pats has won the Derby, but one or the other is almost certain 
to change that Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, winner of the Wood Memorial this year and last year's champion 
2-year-old colt, has been beating up on horses in Florida and New York since 
the year began. Sunday Silence, who has been facing a better group of horses 
out West, is, like Easy Goer, undefeated in three races as a 3-year-old and 
comes to Churchill Downs off an epic 11-length victory in the Santa Anita 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
The day Sunday Silence won at Santa Anita, Valenzuela hit him with his whip at 
least 10 times through the stretch, even though the colt had established a 
clear lead coming out of the turn and no horses were challenging. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Day didn't use his whip at all two weeks later in the Wood, 
although it appeared that Easy Goer might need some urging before he went on to 
a three-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
There's proof here that a jockey can't please all of the people all of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Hancock, Sunday Silence's principal owner, didn't like to see Valenzuela 
flailing away in the Santa Anita Derby, and neither did the colt's trainer, 
Charlie Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
And although Day's ride in the Wood was typical of his aplomb under pressure, 
it is a style that infuriates New York horseplayers, accustomed to seeing more 
aggressive tactics from the likes of Angel Cordero, who might start hustling a 
horse at the three-eighths pole. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela explained to Sunday Silence's handlers that he wanted to make sure 
the horse got enough out of the Santa Anita race to have him ready for the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham seldom emphasizes the jockey's role in the winning of a race. After 
the Santa Anita Derby, the trainer said: 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever said that these jockeys ever came with a lot of brains. But Pat is 
a good rider and that's why we have him. He's got the reputation as a gate 
rider (breaking a horse quickly), but he's got more than that going for him. 
He's an excellent position rider, getting the horse in the spot he needs to be, 
and that should help in the big field that we have in the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Day might not have whipped Easy Goer in the Wood because the only other time he 
used the stick on the horse -- and he has ridden him in all nine starts -- 
there was a negative reaction. That was in Easy Goer's last loss, his 
second-place finish to Is It True in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile over a muddy 
track at Churchill Downs last November. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, I probably shouldn't have even hit him in the Breeders' Cup," 
Day said. "I did it out of desperation, and I think he got annoyed with me, 
because he knew he was doing the best he could on a track that was like peanut 
butter. So he jumped the tire tracks from the starting gate and changed leads 
(switched from one lead foot to the other), and I didn't hit him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Day provided the classic example of his forsaking the whip in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic, racing's first $3-million race, at Hollywood Park in 1984. Day didn't 
hit Wild Again once, even though they were locked in a furious three-horse 
drive with Slew o' Gold and Gate Dancer. Wild Again won by a head. 
</P>
<P>
Day is 35 and Valenzuela is 26. Each has won his share of major races; Day has 
won three other Breeders' Cup stakes and Valenzuela, only a week after his 
apprenticeship ended, won the Santa Anita Derby with Codex in 1980. However, 
Day is winless in six Kentucky Derbies and Valenzuela has failed to win in two 
tries here. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela might have had a couple of other good shots at Churchill Downs, but 
once the horse didn't run and the other time the jockey couldn't be here. 
Trainer Wayne Lukas neglected to nominate Codex, and after Valenzuela won the 
Arkansas Derby with the filly, Althea, in 1984, he suffered a broken clavicle 
in a spill at Hollywood Park and missed the race. 
</P>
<P>
Things seem to happen to Valenzuela, who broke a leg in another spill and 
suffered a broken hand in a Hollywood Park jockeys' room fight with Gary 
Stevens. He has also been in and out of drug and alcohol rehabilitation at 
least three times and in trouble with stewards in California and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Day can relate to Valenzuela's troubled career. In the mid-1970s, the 
small-town jockey from Colorado was trying to carve out a living in New York. 
Day fought with jockeys, went through drug and alcohol problems and eventually 
it cost his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is kind of considered an evangelist on horseback. He is likely as not 
to answer a question with a quotation from the Bible, and he thanks God -- 
before the owner and trainer of the horse -- if he wins an important race. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Pat (Valenzuela) has gone through rehab, and that's necessary when you 
have a problem," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
While Day openly discusses his personal problems, Valenzuela politely maintains 
his privacy and has continued to avoid answering questions about his past drug 
use since he arrived at Churchill Downs on Wednesday.

CARDINALS KO VALENZUELA, PUNCHLESS DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The optimism generated by Fernando Valenzuela in his last start faded faster 
than the twilight Thursday night at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The proud left-hander was gone after only 1 2/3 innings of the Dodgers' 12-0 
loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, the same team Valenzuela had shut out for 
seven innings at Busch Stadium five days before. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he faced only 11 batters, allowing six runs, five of them earned, 
and five hits. 
</P>
<P>
Successors Tim Crews and Ricky Horton were similarly abused as the Cardinals 
had 21 hits before Manager Tom Lasorda called on Stuntman Stopper Mickey 
Hatcher to pitch the ninth inning, saving the wear and tear on one of his 
regular relievers. 
</P>
<P>
The remnants of a crowd of 36,689, having had little to cheer as the Cardinals 
scored early and often in support of Ken Hill's three-hit shutout, reacted with 
glee as Hatcher raced to the mound in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
What followed wasn't pretty, but it ultimately became the only inning in which 
the Cardinals did not get a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher hit Tim Jones in the back with his first pitch, balked Jones to second, 
walked Denny Walling, walked Tom Brunansky to load the bases, got Jose Oquendo 
to ground into a double play as a run scored, then walked Milt Thompson before 
getting Tony Pena on a fly to right field. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd roared as Hatcher left as he had come in, racing to the dugout, where 
he slammed his glove on the top step. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed one more inning. I was finding the zone," Hatcher said with a 
semi-straight face later. "I had good stuff in the pen, then I get in my first 
outing, and that guy (plate umpire Jim Quick) was squeezing me." 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher said he pitched in Little League and high school and had been "waiting 
to do this for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish I had held them without a run," he said. "We might have battled 
back and won this." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lasorda: "The guy's incredible. The people love him. Did you see how they 
were hanging over the railing watching him warm up in the bullpen?" 
</P>
<P>
Watching him warm up? 
</P>
<P>
"They were on their way home," Hatcher said. "I was telling them to get back in 
their seats." 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, Crews and Horton, of course, aren't under the microscope that 
Valenzuela is. 
</P>
<P>
Still without a victory since June 14, Valenzuela has totaled only 29 1/3 
innings of six starts this year, allowing 33 hits and 16 earned runs for an ERA 
of 4.91. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez is 5-0 with Albuquerque, but Lasorda said he felt certain 
Valenzuela will make his next start. Nevertheless, the manager said he was 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt about it," Lasorda said. "The guy was a winner and he's struggling 
now. He didn't pitch good tonight. He kept his stuff down in St. Louis, but got 
it up tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that we have to sit down and evaluate it. The question is with 
his control. His stuff is sufficient. A lot of guys in the big leagues throw 
the same way and win." 
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice President Fred Claire said he, too, was not at a point where he 
is ready to make a determination on Valenzuela's status in the rotation. He 
said there is an ongoing evaluation of Valenzuela's performances and that the 
Dodgers will eventually do what is best for the club. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see the way the Cardinals were swinging the bats tonight, part of 
what happened to Fernando comes under the heading of 'just one of those 
nights.' I mean, the fact that he got knocked out early doesn't place a stamp 
of definition on it. I don't place critical importance on one outing. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he pitched well in St. Louis didn't indicate he was back, and 
the fact that he didn't pitch as well tonight doesn't mean he isn't. I don't 
think it's that clear, that black and white." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was frustrated, Valenzuela shook his head and said: "I knew I would 
have some bad games and this was one of them. I felt I threw pretty good, but 
the Cardinals hit me good. No excuses. The only one to stop the Cardinals 
tonight was Mickey. He pitched good. I used seven pitches and they hit every 
pitch I threw. All I can do is come back next time and try to do better." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela retired the first two Cardinals he faced, then a throwing error by 
Jeff Hamilton cost him the third out of that first inning. Pedro Guerrero, his 
sprained left ankle wrapped in tape, followed with a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing tainted in the second. Oquendo doubled and Thompson homered. 
Two more singles and a walk loaded the bases, bringing on Crews. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero got an infield single to score one run and Brunansky looped a single 
to center to score two. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals got three more runs in the third and one each in the fourth and 
fifth. Pena finished with four hits and Ozzie Smith and Oquendo each had three. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who held the Dodgers scoreless for eight innings of the same game in 
which Valenzuela pitched last Saturday, was even better this time. The 
23-year-old right-hander walked one, struck out nine and restricted the Dodgers 
to three singles -- one by Eddie Murray, stretching his hitting streak to 13 
games, in the first; one by Willie Randolph in the third, and one by Mike 
Scioscia in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The loss snapped a three-game Dodger win streak and was the most lopsided loss 
for the Dodgers since they were beaten, 16-2, by San Francisco on July 29, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We were clobbered," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
For Hatcher, however, it was more than "just one of those nights." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Chris Gwynn was unable to play because of a strained right shoulder 
suffered on a steal attempt Wednesday night. He was examined by Dr. Frank Jobe 
and put on a day-to-day basis. . . . Shortstop Alfredo Griffin was out of the 
lineup for the third consecutive game because of a sprained right thumb. The 
switch-hitting Griffin said he can hit left-handed but not right-handed and is 
not throwing strong enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda stepped on the scales before the game and was excited to 
find that his diet had taken him to 189 pounds, a loss of 29 pounds. If he 
holds it at that, he will win $30,000 from Orel Hershiser and Kirk Gibson, to 
be given to charity. "Orel said he would give me another $10,000 if I got down 
to 140," Lasorda said. "The guy's crazy." . . . The Cardinals sent Wednesday 
night's starting pitcher, Don Heinkel, to Louisville and purchased the contract 
of Ted Power -- formerly of the Dodgers, Cincinnati, Kansas City and Detroit -- 
who was 3-1 at Louisville.

LAKERS WANT TO GET ON WITH QUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having dispatched the Portland Trail Blazers quickly and decisively in the 
first round of the National Basketball Assn. playoffs, the Lakers will take a 
break until at least Sunday while awaiting their opponent for the Western 
Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no side trip to Santa Barbara, as in previous seasons during long 
playoff breaks. In fact, Coach Pat Riley planned to give his players only 
Thursday off before convening again today to prepare for the winner of the 
Seattle-Houston series. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lakers trod lightly when their second-round preference was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Riley was typically diplomatic, saying: "My preference is either one of them." 
Based solely on games against Seattle and Houston this season, it would seem 
that the Lakers would rather play the Rockets, despite the presence of center 
Akeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers posted a 3-1 regular-season record against Houston, the only loss 
being by five points at the Summit March 5. The Lakers had a 4-2 record against 
the SuperSonics, incurring the losses at Seattle. And two of their three home 
victories over Seattle were by a total of only four points. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that an extended break will end a hot streak during which his team has 
won 10 of 11 games -- seven of the last eight in the regular season and all 
three so far in the playoffs -- Riley is hoping that the Lakers will not have 
to wait until Tuesday night to begin the second round. If Seattle, which holds 
a 2-1 lead over Houston, wins Game 4 tonight at Houston, the Lakers will play 
host to the SuperSonics starting Sunday at the Forum. But if a fifth game is 
necessary, the second-round series would not begin until Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many days off wouldn't be helpful, the way we're playing now," Riley said. 
"We did what we had to do (in the first round), now we sit back and prepare for 
either (Seattle or Houston). We're in a good groove now, and you want to make 
it last." 
</P>
<P>
But that's not why Laker players want to start the second round Sunday. The 
prospect of four straight days of practice is hardly appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be unfortunate," center Mychal Thompson said. "He'd work our tails 
off. Practice is harder than games most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also has another reason to want to start the playoffs Sunday against 
Seattle -- to avoid having to face Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough on us big guys," Thompson said. "I don't know any center in the 
league who wants to go against Akeem." 
</P>
<P>
In the Portland series, the Lakers' only disadvantage figured to be the inside 
game. But the tandem of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Thompson clearly outplayed 
Portland's four big men -- Kevin Duckworth, Sam Bowie, Steve Johnson and 
Caldwell Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar and Thompson combined to average 28.6 points and 10.6 rebounds. 
Portland's four big men combined to average 25.1 points and 16.8 rebounds. And 
A.C. Green, the Lakers' power forward, led all rebounders with a 9.6 average. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers dominated most statistical categories in the first-round series: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Lakers shot 52%; the Trail Blazers 45.3%. Whereas Portland shot better 
than 50% only in Game 3, the Lakers shot better than 50% twice and 48% in Game 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Lakers held a 136-124 rebounding advantage against a team with a height 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Lakers finished with a 44-30 advantage in steals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the 12 quarters of the series, the Lakers had the advantage in all but 
three. And the Trail Blazers held the lead for only 13 of the 144 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing very well now," Abdul-Jabbar said. "I was kind of disappointed 
near the end (of the regular season), but we picked it up a notch in the last 
week of the season and it's continued now." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>

Laker guard Byron Scott was elbowed sharply in the head by Portland center Sam 
Bowie in the second half of Wednesday night's game. Scott said that, after the 
blow, his left ear bled internally. Scott, who made seven of 11 shots Wednesday 
night, including three three-point baskets, said he also still has some pain in 
his troublesome right palm. . . . Magic Johnson was the Lakers' leading scorer 
in the series, averaging 27.3 points. Scott averaged 22.3 and James Worthy 
19.6. . . . Clyde Drexler, who led the Trail Blazers with a 27.6 scoring 
average in the series, on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's inspired play in the series: 
"He looked like he was 21 again. It was an incredible performance by a legend 
in his own time." 
</P>
<P>
This marked the fourth straight season that the Trail Blazers have been 
eliminated in the first round. In the wake of the latest first-round 
elimination, new Trail Blazer owner Paul Allen soon will determine the fate of 
interim Coach Rick Adelman and -- as long rumored in Portland -- Bucky 
Buckwalter, the vice president of basketball operations. "I'll just have to 
wait like everyone else," Adelman said after Wednesday's loss. "I hope it won't 
be too long. I really have no idea what they are going to do."

General Manager Bobby Beathard of the Washington Redskins will not return to 
the team after his contract expires May 30, a Virginia television station 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The station reported that Beathard wants to get away from football and will 
return to his home on the West Coast upon the expiration of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The station also cited "squabbles" between Beathard and Coach Joe Gibbs as a 
factor in the general manager's decision to leave the team that he has been a 
part of since 1978.

China's Yu Xiaoling finished first in the women's one-meter team event 
Thursday, and teammate Tan Liangde edged American Kent Ferguson in the men's 
three-meter team competion of the FINA World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Yu was just ahead of teammate Gao Min, the Olympic springboard gold medalist, 
scoring 481.98 points for her 10 dives at the Indiana University Natatorium. 
</P>
<P>
Gao, who said through an interpreter that she spends little time on the 
one-meter board, had 468.24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tan, second to Greg Louganis on the three-meter board in both the 1984 and 1988 
Olympics, scored 640.98 points to lead the men's field of 27 hoping to score 
high enough to move into the individual competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, making a comeback after undergoing shoulder surgery last September, 
had 637.92 points for his 11 dives. 
</P>
<P>
"I did well except for the last dive," said Ferguson, 26. "I had a little 
trouble on the board work and just miscalucated the entry." 
</P>
<P>
American Mark Bradshaw, 25, who resigned as diving coach at West Point this 
year to begin diving again, was third with 631.65 points, and Li Deliang, the 
Olympic springboard bronze medalist, placed fourth with 596.79. 
</P>
<P>
Daphne Jongejans of the Netherlands was third among the 17 competitors in the 
women's one-meter with 429.15 points. U.S. national champion Julie Farell, 
making her debut in international competition, was fourth with 426.12. 
</P>
<P>
China leads the team competition with 387 points after four of the six events. 
The United States, the defending champion, was second with 369, followed by the 
Soviet Union with 341 and Mexico with 321.

NCAA VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
STANFORD STAR HAS HAD A BELLYFUL OF DISRESPECT; VOWS TO CHURN OUT A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Fortune has been feeling sick to his stomach. However, that's a positive 
sign for Stanford's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, the Cardinal's do-everything hitter from Laguna Beach, has a penchant 
for suffering abdominal misery shortly before -- and sometimes during -- the 
most important matches of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer in Seoul, for instance, Fortune was stricken with food poisoning 
four days before the United States played the Soviet Union in the Olympic 
gold-medal match. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, a backup middle blocker for Team USA, missed the semifinal against 
Brazil. But with his stomach still gurgling, he came off the bench in the final 
and put away match point to secure the gold as the United States defeated the 
Soviets in four games. 
</P>
<P>
And last Saturday, suffering from a stomach virus that required sprints to the 
restroom between games, Fortune had 33 kills and 20 digs as Stanford defeated 
Hawaii in five games to win the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. 
regional qualifying tournament at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
The victory earned Stanford its first berth in the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn.'s Division I Final Four, which begins tonight at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (24-5), ranked second in the final regular-season poll, will play 
ninth-ranked Ball State (17-12) of Muncie, Ind., at 5:30. Top-ranked UCLA 
(27-5) will play 11th-ranked Penn State (16-10) in the other semifinal at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
"I still had a hard time keeping food down last night," Fortune said the other 
day. "This could be a good omen." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and Stanford, which split two conference matches this season, are expected 
to advance to Saturday night's final. 
</P>
<P>
But plenty of good Fortune will be required if Stanford is to become the first 
school other than UCLA, USC, Pepperdine or San Diego State to win a national 
title -- especially with UCLA the host school. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have won 12 national championships under Coach Al Scates since the 
NCAA began sponsoring men's volleyball in 1970. They are 18-0 in playoff 
matches at Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a good position to win it, but Stanford should be favored," said 
Scates, who is in his 27th season with the Bruins. "Stanford has more firepower 
than anyone. You can't ignore anybody on that team." 
</P>
<P>
Least of all Fortune, a 6-foot-6 senior who was a first-team All-American 
middle blocker for the Cardinal in 1987 before red-shirting so he could train 
full-time with the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Marv Dunphy, who coached Team USA before returning to Pepperdine this season, 
called Fortune "the most receptive kid I have ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
Practicing daily against the best players in the world developed Fortune's 
skills. It also instilled a commitment to perform at a peak level regardless of 
the strength of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I learned last year playing with Karch (Kiraly) and Steve 
Timmons," Fortune said. "Right from the start, when I got back to Stanford I 
tried to establish a different, more serious attitude than there was in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, a former All-Southern Section player at Laguna Beach High School, was 
one of several talented recruits -- among them 6-6 junior middle blocker Dan 
Hanan of Edison High in Huntington Beach -- culled by Stanford Coach Fred Sturm 
in the last five seasons. The influx of talent has helped Stanford overcome its 
reputation as nothing more than a token member of the powerful WIVA. 
</P>
<P>
It also has allowed Sturm flexibility. Fortune, 23, was moved from middle 
blocker to the outside this season so the team could benefit from his hitting 
and passing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a more polished volleyball player, a more intelligent volleyball player 
and he's playing a larger leadership role," Sturm said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune has responded to the switch by leading Stanford in kills, with 6.9 a 
game, and digs, with 2.9. He also shares responsibility for turning a Cardinal 
team that was 11-19 overall and 5-13 in conference last season into a unit that 
finished 17-3 in the WIVA and tied UCLA for the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of frustrating on the national team, always hearing guys from 
UCLA, USC and Pepperdine saying, 'Stanford? You guys were terrible and didn't 
deserve to be in the league,' " said Fortune, who was the only member of the 
Olympic team with collegiate eligibility. "Winning a share of the league title 
was like vindication." 
</P>
<P>
Fortune said that Stanford wants to avenge the decision that forced the 
Cardinal to win the qualifying regional while UCLA was given a bye into the 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a scheduling error, Stanford would have exceeded the NCAA match 
limit in a season had the Cardinal played a one-match playoff. UCLA was granted 
its bid simply by winning a coin-flip. 
</P>
<P>
An NCAA championship would be a crowning addition to Fortune's collection of 
championships, which already includes Laguna Beach High's Southern Section 
title in 1983 and the Olympic gold he won in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford has been the butt of a lot of jokes," Fortune said. "We're going to 
try and change that this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it makes him sick.

GRAY WHALE ENTANGLED IN GILL NET IS RESCUED BY SPORTFISHING VESSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California gray whale found entangled in a commercial fisherman's gill net by 
a sportfishing boat captain Thursday morning was rescued and appeared to have 
survived the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Duane, owner-operator of the Matt Walsh out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing, 
said he noticed the whale floundering in what he said was a halibut gill net 
about 1 1/2 miles southeast of the harbor's breakwater. 
</P>
<P>
Duane dropped anchor through the net and circled the whale, then pulled up 
anchor and, while the crew held the whale's injured fluke, cut the mammal 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
The National Marine Fisheries Service's Terminal Island office confirmed that a 
whale had been rescued and said that although it can't recommend that boaters 
coming across similar situations attempt such a rescue, in this case Duane did 
the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The safety of the animals is the top priority," said Joe Cordaro, a service 
biologist stationed at Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
Cordaro added that the gill net was in legal waters, "but because it involved 
an endangered species we can issue a fine if we can trace the (identification) 
tags on the net. Unfortunately, this net had no tags." PETE THOMAS

EASY GOER, FAVORED AT 3-5, DRAWS POST POSITION NO. 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Easy Goer, the favorite for the 115th Kentucky Derby Saturday at Churchill 
Downs, drew the No. 14 post in a 16-horse field when entries were taken 
Thursday, but trainer Shug McGaughey was not dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been happy with anything but No. 1 or being in the second 
starting gate," McGaughey said. "One of my main concerns was being on the 
inside, because on that first turn, everybody will be trying to pack you in." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who is given the best chance for an upset, will start from the 
No. 10 post. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've got good horses, you shouldn't have to worry about the post," said 
Charlie Whittingham, who trains Sunday Silence. "When Ferdinand drew No. 1 for 
the Derby in 1986, I hated it, but he won anyway. Easy Goer is in the main 
gate, so his post shouldn't bother him too much." 
</P>
<P>
The main gate accommodates 14 horses. Being in the auxiliary gate is considered 
a disadvantage because that gate is smaller and the horses break from the 
extreme outside for the cavalry charge through the stretch the first time. In 
1982, Gato Del Sol became the only Derby winner to have started from the extra 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Wind Splitter and Northern Wolf will break from the second gate. They 
have other reasons to lose, having been placed in the mutuel field, along with 
Notation, by Churchill Downs handicapper Mike Battaglia. The tote board can 
handle only 12 numbers and the overflow, so the horses with the least chance of 
winning are grouped together for betting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, who will run with an entrymate, Awe Inspiring, is listed as the 3-5 
favorite. The last odds-on favorite to win the Derby was Spectacular Bid, who 
went off at 3-5 in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup for the 1 1/4-mile, $759,200 Derby, in order of post position: 
</P>
<P>
Clever Trevor, with Don Pettinger riding at odds of 30-1; Flying Continental, 
Corey Black, 30-1; Western Playboy, Randy Romero, 8-1; Hawkster, Marco 
Castaneda, 30-1; Shy Tom, Chris Antley, 8-1; Houston, Laffit Pincay, 8-1; 
Dansil, Larry Snyder, 20-1; Faultless Ensign, Chris De Carlo, 50-1; Triple 
Buck, Jose Santos, 30-1; Sunday Silence, Pat Valenzuela, 3-1; Irish Actor, Don 
Howard, 50-1; Notation, Herb McCauley, 50-1; Awe Inspiring, Craig Perret, 3-5; 
Easy Goer, Pat Day, 3-5; Wind Splitter, Donnie Miller, 50-1, and Northern Wolf, 
Jo Jo Ladner, 50-1. 
</P>
<P>
Like Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring, Houston and Shy Tom are coupled in the 
betting because both horses are trained by Wayne Lukas. All of the starters 
will carry 126 pounds. First is worth $584,200. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence showed that he is ready for Easy Goer's challenge by working a 
half-mile Thursday morning in :46 3/5. Easy Goer breezed in :47. 
</P>
<P>
There was one jockey change when entries were drawn, Don Howard replacing Eddie 
Maple on Irish Actor. Maple failed to win while riding Irish Actor in his last 
three starts, including a fourth place in the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're not winning, you've got to try something," said LeRoy Jolley, who 
trains Irish Actor. 
</P>
<P>
The weather forecast, which originally called for showers Saturday, has been 
changed to partly cloudy with temperatures in the low 60s.

Makeshift measures filled the gap left by 23,000 fired bus workers as Mexico 
City's government seized the opportunity to revamp its inefficient transport 
system. The drivers went on strike and were fired Wednesday, but a spot check 
made a day later showed that commuters were just 15 minutes to half an hour 
late for work. The fact that nearly a quarter of the capital's 8.5 million 
residents are taking this week off to mark two holidays reduced the strike's 
impact. Subways and trolleys continued to operate. City spokesman Alfonso Marin 
said that a panel of experts is meeting to discuss transit reorganization and 
"we will come up with a solution in about a week."

About 17,000 grocery workers in Northern and Central California overwhelmingly 
ratified a 3-year contract with major supermarket chains, union officials 
announced. The five locals of the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers union 
averaged 82.3% approval, said spokesman Phil Tucker. Details of the pact have 
not yet been released, pending a second ratification vote by 20,000 grocery 
workers in the Bay Area.

The final day of a two-day strike by UC Berkeley graduate students who work as 
teaching assistants, research assistants and tutors forced the cancellation of 
75% of classes, the strikers claimed. "We were absolutely successful," said 
Colette Patt, a leader of the graduate students' association which is seeking 
UC recognition as a union. Tom Debley, a campus spokesman, said he could not 
confirm the percentage of cancellations but he said that most of the missed 
classes will be rescheduled before final exams later this month. Debley said UC 
administrators will meet soon with the teaching assistants.

A federal judge in Madison, Wis., refused to prohibit the Lac du Flambeau band 
of Chippewa Indians from spearing all of its allowable fish catch on some 
Wisconsin lakes. An agreement to cut the fish take was reached at a meeting 
more than two weeks ago between Gov. Tommy G. Thompson and leaders of the six 
Chippewa bands. But after increasing harassment by sport fishermen who are 
opposed to the Indians' off-reservation spearing, the tribal chief said that 
the band might begin taking 100% of the fish that biologists consider safe to 
take from a lake. Meanwhile, Wisconsin's congressional delegation introduced 
legislation that would revise the terms of Indian treaties to allow more sport 
fishing in the Chippewa area of the state.

A Yorba Linda man claiming to have AIDS and with "nothing to lose" was arrested 
after a tense standoff at a Dana Point bank where he took three people hostage 
at knifepoint during a foiled robbery, authorities said. David Clyde Sweeton, 
34, a salesman who recently moved to Yorba Linda from San Juan Capistrano, 
surrendered to FBI agents and Orange County sheriff's deputies after the 
30-minute incident at a First Interstate Bank branch, officials said. His 
hostages, two female employees and a female customer, were released shaken but 
unharmed, an FBI official said. Sweeton was held in Orange County Jail on 
suspicion of bank robbery.

A deliberately set fire broke out in the office of Tehipite Middle School in 
Fresno less than 24 hours after a similar fire did extensive damage in the 
administration building at the city's Roosevelt High School. Police and fire 
investigators said there were similarities in both blazes, but initial 
investigation did not reveal links between the incidents. The middle school 
fire started in the main office, but firefighters managed to douse the flames 
quickly, limiting damage to about $4,500. Investigators said flammable liquid 
was poured on several desks and ignited.

The typical American household, which contained 5.79 people when the first 
census was taken in 1790, is down statistically to just over 2 1/2 people, a 
record low, the Census Bureau said. The household is shrinking as families have 
fewer children, more young people set up housekeeping on their own and the 
number of elderly maintaining their own households grows. There were 91.5 
million households in the country as of last July 1, the bureau said, with an 
average population of 2.62 people each. That was down from 2.64 people a year 
earlier and 2.75 people in the 1980 census.

PADRES' LOSS TO CUBS TESTS MCKEON'S PATIENCE 
</P>

The first thing to disappear was their hitting. Then it was their fielding. Now 
it's their heads, which on Thursday led Jack McKeon to issue a warning. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing vanishing on these Padres is going to be their manager's 
sufferance. 
</P>
<P>
"My patience is wearing thin," said McKeon after the Padres lost, 4-0, to the 
Chicago Cubs, their second consecutive loss and third in four games on this 
home stand. "In maybe a week, maybe a month . . . it could be time for some 
changes. Some guys on our bench may deserve a chance. Or another alternative is 
to go out (to other teams) and see what's out there. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been riding it out with these guys . . . but I'm getting tired." 
</P>
<P>
What put him to sleep Thursday was that, against a career underachiever named 
Mike Bielecki, the Padres managed just five hits and blew an easy chance to 
lead before the game was 10 minutes old. Afterward he also was concerned about 
the loss of another starter to injury -- no matter how poorly John Kruk (.186) 
was hitting. 
</P>
<P>
While attempting a diving catch of Andre Dawson's line drive in the second 
inning, Kruk's 200-pound body crashed into the gravel on the right-field 
warning track. Dawson ended up with a triple and Kruk ended up in the hospital, 
Scripps Clinic, where he was held overnight with a strained right shoulder and 
right hip pointer. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are worried less about the shoulder than the hip, where Kruk 
suffered a severe bruise. It's the sort of injury that keeps a player from 
running properly and could take a couple of weeks to heal. 
</P>
<P>
If Kruk becomes this year's first Padre regular to go on the disabled list, the 
leading candidate to replace him would be Rob Nelson, the left-handed hitting 
first baseman from triple-A Las Vegas. Entering Thursday night, Nelson was in 
the midst of a 16-game hitting streak with a .344 average and Pacific Coast 
League-leading seven homers with 17 RBIs. Nelson could give the Padres 
left-handed punch off the bench. Or, if McKeon wants him in the starting 
lineup, first baseman Jack Clark could even move to right field for a game or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
Kruk joins shortstop Garry Templeton (strained shoulder) and second baseman 
Roberto Alomar (fat lip) on the sidelines, although look for both to return to 
the lineup sometime this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But back to McKeon's original point. The main problem with the Padres (15-15) 
is not their bodies but their heads. In trying to swing for homers and stats, 
they are forgetting to do the little things that move runners and score runs. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon had a word for that type of play after the Padres were shut out for a 
major league-leading fifth time after just 11 shutouts last season. He called 
it "selfish." 
</P>
<P>
Warned McKeon: "If you don't give a darn about being an unselfish player, you 
are going to end up like Charlie Finley said. He said if you want to be a hog, 
you are going to wind up eating manure. 
</P>
<P>
"If these guys want to be selfish, fine. They are going to join me on the 
bench." 
</P>
<P>
Although McKeon was referring to little things that have happened all season, 
he was talking about one Thursday episode in particular. It was the something 
the Padres couldn't do . . . and something the Cubs did twice, both times 
giving them runs. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts led off the Padre first with a triple, and all anybody needed to do 
was hit a grounder to the right side to score him. But John Kruk struck out. 
And after Tony Gwynn walked, Jack Clark grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was the Cubs' turn. Dawson led off the second with that triple off 
starter Walt Terrell that Kruk caught and then dropped as he swan-dived to the 
ground. The next hitter, Mark Grace, hit an easy grounder to second baseman 
Roberts, and Dawson scored the Cubs' first run. 
</P>
<P>
In case the Padres weren't watching, two innings later, the Cubs showed them 
again. Dawson again led off with a triple, this one on a fly to center field 
that Gwynn admitted he misplayed as he crashed into the wall underneath it. 
Grace stepped up and tapped a grounder down the first base line, Dawson scored 
again, and it was 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a triple, and all we need is a ground ball to be up, 1-0, but we don't 
get it," McKeon said. "Then look at those guys, two triples and two ground 
balls, and they are up 2-0." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon is not mad at Clark, who grounded into another double play and struck 
out twice in equaling probably his worst game of the year. After all, you don't 
get mad at guys who have given you four of your 15 victories with homers. And 
he's not mad at Gwynn, who left two runners stranded with a grounder in the 
sixth and also booted a grounder in center field, leading to the Cubs' final 
two runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Clark and Tony can't carry this club, they need some help," McKeon said. "They 
can't carry it all on their shoulders. They can't always expect to win on a 
Clark home run." 
</P>
<P>
Although he wouldn't mention names, the stats show that such hitting problems 
are occuring with Carmelo Martinez (.183 average), Benito Santiago (.217) and 
the unfortunate Kruk. But enough guys are slumping that Martinez noted, "Jack 
would have to make a lot of changes." 
</P>
<P>
Don't remind McKeon, who was asked if it may be time for his second team 
meeting of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be time for a lot of things," he said before picking up the ringing 
phone on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
Pause. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey fellas, it's President Reagan," he said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so Reagan is no longer the president. Lately, these Padres haven't seemed 
like a pennant contender, either. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shane Mack's sore right elbow has finally been declared healthy, and Mack has 
been optioned to triple-A Las Vegas. The other Padre minor leaguer who began 
the season on the disabled list, pitcher Eric Nolte, should be fully recovered 
from surgery on a perforated ulcer and be pitching for Las Vegas early next 
week. . . . Roberto Alomar showed up with a fat lower lip Thursday after 
fouling a ball off it late Wednesday. The impact loosened a tooth and required 
10 stitches in the lip. Alomar said he would be fine to play -- except the lip 
prevents him from eating hot foods and therefore has left him weak. "I need to 
feel strong to play and right now I don't feel strong," Alomar said. "Maybe I 
can be back in a day or two, as soon as I can get something down." When he 
returns, look for him to wear a special batting helmet with a shield over his 
mouth. His Thursday replacement, Bip Roberts, went one for four with a triple 
and a high relay throw to third that, if on target, might have cut down Andre 
Dawson attempting a fourth-inning triple. . . . Tony Gwynn admitted he 
misplayed Dawson's triple in the fourth -- "I could have made the play, I 
didn't see the ball off the bat good," he said. But he noted that there is a 
bigger problem there. It's Thursday day games. "Thursday day games here are 
stupid," Gwynn said. "Forget the business end of the things. For me, they are 
just stupid. When the fourth inning comes, that sun is coming right down at 
you, you can hardly see. I can understand Sunday afternoon games, but this is 
such a hard park to see in, Thursday games are stupid. But hey, I'm not the 
schedule-maker." And if he were? "The way we are playing this year, I'd 
schedule all our games on the road."

VALLEY DISPATCHES MOORPARK, GAINS STATE BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Joey Kane got down and dirty Thursday at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore left-hander mixed his fastball with off-speed pitches in the dirt 
and kept Moorpark College batters off balance in Valley's 7-4 semifinal victory 
in the Western State Conference playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The victory assured Valley (29-10-1) of a berth in the state tournament May 11. 
It also vaulted the Monarchs into the championship round of the WSC playoffs, 
in which they must sweep a doubleheader Saturday at Ventura to enter the state 
tournament as the conference's top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's immediate future will be determined Monday at a meeting of the state 
tournament seeding committee. The Raiders (23-16) and nine-time WSC champion 
Canyons, which Moorpark eliminated from the playoffs Tuesday, are prime 
candidates for an at-large berth in the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Coach Ron Stillwell, whose resignation will take effect at the end of 
the season, said that he hoped Thursday's loss would not be the swan song to 
his five-year coaching career at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just hoping we get an at-large bid," Stillwell said. "I'm thinking 
positive that we'll have another game." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking too much, at least while he was pitching, was the explanation Valley 
catcher Eric Vargas gave for a recent slump experienced by Kane, who improved 
to 7-5 with his first victory in a month. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to do too much," Vargas said. "I just told him to throw the ball 
in the dirt and I'd take care of it. When he's on, that's how he pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Kane, in full command of his curve and forkball, allowed six hits and struck 
out four in 6 1/3 innings before giving way to freshman right-hander Wayne 
Schull, who pitched impressively in relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I really let it go today," said Kane, who will play at Cal State Long Beach 
next season. "It felt good to keep the ball down and get some ground balls." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark scored the game's first run in the second inning when Darren Aurand 
singled in Kris Kaelin, who had doubled to lead off. 
</P>
<P>
Valley took the lead for good in the home half of the inning on Vladimir 
Pajcin's two-run home run, his fourth of the season, off Moorpark starter Jeff 
Berman. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gerbovaz replaced Berman at the outset of the third inning and was greeted 
with consecutive singles by Ray Sabado, Mike Caputi, Greg Struhl and Mark 
Cavarretta as Valley built its lead to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Caputi's run-scoring double in the fourth made the score 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark mounted its only threat in the seventh inning after Kane loaded the 
bases by surrendering a double to Aurand and issuing consecutive walks to 
Darren Romano and Don Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Aurand was thrown out at the plate by Kane on a tapper by Dan Smith. But 
Moorpark pushed across a run when Sabado, Valley's shortstop, threw late to 
second base after making a diving stop of Darin Furlong's ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
Schull replaced Kane and struck out Steve Sisco. Craig Pearson followed with a 
two-run single to make the score 5-4. Schull recovered to end the rally by 
retiring Kaelin on a ground out to second. 
</P>
<P>
"Kane did a good job getting his stuff over," Kaelin said. "And that guy 
(Schull) who came in for him did a heck of a job closing the door." 
</P>
<P>
Valley scored its final runs in the seventh on a home run by Caputi, his first, 
and a single by John Stephens that drove in Cavarretta, who had been hit by a 
pitch.

BIRMINGHAM'S BURT WINS 2 OF 3 SPRINT TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Rodney Burt of Birmingham High won the 200 and 400 meters at the Valley Pac-8 
Conference track and field finals Thursday. But it was the race he lost -- the 
100 meters -- that made the biggest impression on him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been a bad day," Burt said. "I wasn't worried about running any 
particular times today, but I really wanted to win all three sprints." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Casey of Sylmar ended Burt's hopes for a triple early in the meet when 
he surged away in the last 50 meters of the 100 to win in 11.0 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Burt, fifth in the 400 in last year's City Section championships, placed second 
in the same time, although the official results initially placed him no better 
than sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs just felt tight," said Burt, who followed his defeat in the 100 with 
easy victories in the 400 (48.6) and 200 (22.6). "It didn't surprise me when I 
lost the 100 because my legs just didn't feel strong." 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons as 
Sylmar's tailback, was competing in only his third meet of the season. Until 
recently, he had been concentrating on spring football practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Football has been my main focus until the last couple of weeks," he said. "I'm 
still not in top shape for track." 
</P>
<P>
Figuring that he won't be in peak condition for at least a couple of weeks, 
Casey just hopes he is still running when the City finals take place May 25. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to run a lot faster in the next few weeks if I want to get 
there," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
Feltina Means of Van Nuys won four events to highlight the girls' meet. 
</P>
<P>
Third in the high jump in last year's City meet, the junior won the 100 low 
hurdles in 16.9, the 300 low hurdles in 47.5, the high jump at 4 feet, 10 
inches and the long jump at 16-11. 
</P>
<P>
The long jump mark was a personal best for Means and the 300-hurdle time tied 
her personal best. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Gastelum of Birmingham, William Childs of Reseda and Sonya Finch of Grant 
were double winners. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum, a junior, won the 1,600 (4 minutes, 28.7 seconds) and the 3,200 
(10:04.6), and Childs took the 110 high hurdles (15.2) and the 300 intermediate 
hurdles (41.2). 
</P>
<P>
Finch placed first in the 100 (12.6) and 400 (1:00.1), and finished second in 
the 200 (27.2).

PIERCE MEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM OPENS DEFENSE OF STATE TITLE

<P>
The Pierce College men's volleyball team will attempt to defend its title today 
when the Brahmas begin play in the four-team state junior college championships 
at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast, the South Coast Conference champion, will play West Valley of San 
Jose at 10 a.m. Pierce, which finished second in the South Coast Conference, 
will play Golden West at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The winners of the semifinals will meet at 7 p.m. for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast, with four starters back from the team that won the 1987 state 
title, is favored to win the championship. The Pirates defeated Pierce twice 
this season in matches that lasted four and five games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our kids will respond to the challenge," Pierce Coach Ken Stanley 
said. "We are looking for that match with Orange Coast, but if we start looking 
past our opening match, we're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce is led by outside hitter Rico Guimaraes, who was all-conference last 
season, and middle blockers Turhan Douglas, Mark Grondan and Corey Davidson.

SAN FERNANDO'S PRICE WINS CITY TITLE IN VAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Fernando High senior Tauhid Price scored a 9.15 to win the vault at the 
City Section gymnastics championships at University High on Thursday, but the 
night belonged to Huntington Park's Frank Baca, who won the all-around title. 
</P>
<P>
Baca took a 2.7-point lead early in the competition, tying for second with Tim 
Weaver of Wilson in the floor exercise, the night's opening event, then winning 
on the pommel horse and the rings. He finished third in the vault and second in 
parallel bars before winning the final event, the horizontal bar, with an 8.7. 
</P>
<P>
Baca's winning score of 50.4 was 3.8 points ahead of Edwin Hernandez of 
Hamilton. Victor Fain of University was third with 43.0. 
</P>
<P>
Price won the floor exercise with 8.7 points, but it was in the vault where he 
was poised to score big. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in here expecting to win the floor and vault in reclaiming what I 
thought should have been my titles last year," said Price, who had a 
disappointing night in last year's City finals. "After hitting that vault, 
though, I felt real good.' 
</P>
<P>
Price was third after two events but scored just 5.1 points on the rings, his 
worst performance of the night. That knocked him out of contention for the 
all-around title and he wound up sixth with 40.65 points. 
</P>
<P>
Baca, a junior, was second in the City all-around as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hurt last year and couldn't perform well," he said. "This year is 
vindication."

NOON TOPS STATE MARK IN SHOTPUT

<P>
Fallbrook junior Brent Noon bettered the state record in the shotput Thursday 
when he threw 69-feet-8 1/4 in the the Warriors' dual meet against Orange Glen 
at Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the meet, Lenny McGill of Orange Glen had a 1989 state-leading triple 
jump of 50-4. 
</P>
<P>
Noon surpassed the record of Capistrano Valley's Brian Blutreich, who threw 
69-6 1/2 in 1985. Noon also increased his 1989 national lead to 3-0 3/4 over 
Louisiana's Ken Marshall, younger brother of the Washington Redskin linebacker 
Wilbur Marshall. The throw was also ninth best on the all-time national list. 
</P>
<P>
McGill's triple jump was one inch better than Phouphet Singbandith of Anaheim 
Magnolia High. While there was no wind gauge present, the wind was said to be 
negligible.

Escondido 4, San Pasqual 2 -- It has been said that baseball is the only place 
where a sacrifice is really appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
If so, Brian Frank and Jeff Hopkins gained some respect from their teammates 
when each drove in a run with a sacrifice fly during host Escondido's victory 
over its cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
"We work on that a lot, we try and move the runners over any way we can," said 
Escondido pitcher Robert Erp (7-2), the beneficiary. "And we got a couple of 
them today." 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, Frank delivered a long fly out to center -- long enough 
that Gerald Cabral was able to tag up at third and trot across the plate for 
the Cougars' first run. 
</P>
<P>
Now fast-forward to the sixth, Escondido clinging to a 3-2 lead. Jim McCarthy 
is standing on second, the result of a whistling double down the left field 
line. Up steps Frank. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to hit the ball to the right side to get the runner to third," 
Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, a right-handed batter, did get it over to the right side, all the way to 
the warning track in right. Once Eric Marsh caught it, McCarthy took off for 
third and made it without a play. 
</P>
<P>
That set the stage for Hopkins, who also flied to right to score the runner. 
</P>
<P>
Another Cougar, catcher Tom Afenir, contributed in a more dramatic way in the 
fourth inning by delivering his third home run in the past two games. JOHN GEIS

'HAWK' VISITS HIS THERAPISTS; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN HE FEELS DOWN, DAWSON SEEKS OUT THE PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Inevitably, the talk in the Padre clubhouse Thursday turned to the awesome 
hitting of Chicago's Andre Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
The man called "The Hawk" had just pummeled Padre pitching for the second time 
in less than 24 hours, adding two triples and two singles to the home run and 
triple he hit Wednesday night. He had scored all but one of the Cubs' runs in a 
4-0 victory that gave them a sweep of the two-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, the Padres' three-time batting champion, said, "He has just worn us 
out the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark, Dawson's slugging counterpart with the Padres, said, "When their 
big stick starts doing the job like that, it inspires everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Both Gwynn and Clark made significant points. Dawson habitually mistreats the 
Padres, and as he goes, so go the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these numbers: 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Dawson's first season with the Cubs, he batted .350 against the 
Padres, with eight home runs. Last year, he batted .340 with five home runs. 
Now he is off to a .524 start in five games against San Diego, with only one 
home run but three triples. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from his 11 hits in 21 at-bats against the Padres, Dawson is hitting just 
.211 -- 16 for 76. His season average is .278. 
</P>
<P>
When the Cubs arrived, Dawson was in the throes of a slump in which he had only 
six hits in 35 at-bats. Take away his five for 13 against the Padres, and he 
was one for 22. 
</P>
<P>
As for his point about how much Dawson means to his team, Clark could well have 
had his own situation in mind. He was fresh from a disastrous day that included 
two double plays and a game-ending strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
When Dawson wasn't hitting, the Cubs were averaging two runs and usually 
losing. Now they have won four of five games from the Padres and, with their 
pitching suddenly getting hot, six of eight overall. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Dawson has hit 14 of his 28 career home runs against the Padres 
since joining the Cubs. That's as many in two seasons and a month with the Cubs 
as in 10 seasons and a month with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson has taken a particular liking to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, batting 
.310 with 16 home runs here. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a definite answer for it," he said. "But I see the ball well 
here. It's a good park to play in, and it has a good atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks, Dawson had rarely hit a ball hard. Against the Padres, he 
crushed just about everything he swung at. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been struggling to get my rhythm," he said. "The trouble was, I was 
laying back and hitting the ball where it was pitched instead of being 
aggressive. I was just feeling for the ball, and I have to attack it to be 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he felt the pressure of having to carry the Cubs, Dawson said, "Not 
really. It's a 24-man team, not one individual. If somebody isn't hitting, the 
others have to pick each other up." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson was the National League's most valuable player in 1987, hitting 49 home 
runs and driving in 137 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of what I did, we finished in last place," he said. "That tells you 
what I mean. No one man can carry a ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
That drew less than total agreement from Mark Grace, the Cubs' first baseman 
from San Diego State who follows Dawson in the batting order and twice drove 
him in with groundouts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Grace: "From what happened the last two days, you can see how our offense 
clicks when Andre Dawson is hitting. When he's in a groove, there's always 
somebody on base. It's funny how the Padres bring out the best in him." 
</P>
<P>
Grace is hitting .313 -- also fielding exceptionally well -- and the value of 
his presence behind Dawson has brought great satisfaction to Cub Manager Don 
Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
"All I heard all winter was who was going to hit behind the Hawk," Zimmer said. 
"That was the main topic for 100 days. Well, everybody can't have Ted Williams 
hitting behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I don't hear that stuff anymore. They can't pitch around Dawson with Grace 
in the on-deck circle."

<P>
The University of San Diego and San Diego State women's tennis teams Thursday 
were selected to the NCAA team championships to be held next Wednesday through 
Friday in Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the first appearance for USD, ranked 14th in the nation. No. 16 
SDSU, which finished fourth in 1984, will be making its fifth trip since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In first-round matches Wednesday, USD (seeded 15th) will play Tennessee (17), 
and SDSU (16) will play William &amp; Mary (20).

Jennifer Larking, ranked 30th in singles, leads the Toreras (17-7). Freshman 
Stacey Martin of Tennessee (17-6) is ranked second with a 32-1 record. No. 72 
Sondra Mitchell plays No. 1 singles for the Aztecs (13-9), No. 56 Danielle 
Durak for William &amp; Mary (17-2). 
</P>
<P>
If both teams win in the first round, SDSU will play top-seeded Stanford and 
USD second-seeded Florida. The Toreras and Aztecs could only meet in the 
championship of the 20-draw, single-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College is tied for first with Westmont College after the 
second round of the NAIA District 3 tournament in Santa Barbara. PLNC's Kim 
Wright and Shannon Anderson advanced to today's semifinals in singles and 
doubles, and Aileen Fermin and Dede Walker advanced in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S GOLF 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's Tim Todd and Wayne Kumagai shot 71s, one behind Air Force's 
Chris Gough, to give the Aztecs a first-round lead in the Western Athletic 
Conference championships at the University of New Mexico South Golf Course in 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU, at 290, leads Texas El Paso (291) and New Mexico (293) in the 54-hole 
tournament. Bill Coleman added a 72 and Dave Schnider a 76 for the Aztecs, who 
are coached by Denny Stolz, the former football coach. 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE SIGNING 
</P>
<P>
Christian High catcher Merv Hartman has signed a national letter of intent to 
play baseball at the University of San Diego. Hartman, who is hitting .464 (26 
for 56) with five home runs, chose USD over playing football for Army.

They're not exactly the most ruthless competitors or greatest showmen -- you

What you will see at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club this week at the annual

Lee came to La Jolla with his wife, daughter and 3-year old granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids don't get too excited about it," Lee said. "My daughter thinks I'm 
going through a mid-life crisis, too late." 
</P>
<P>
A former college and semi-pro baseball player, Lee began playing tennis at 53. 
</P>
<P>
"I started watching Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, and that got me really 
interested," Lee said. "I really admired Bobby Riggs for getting out there." 
</P>
<P>
Lee has never been afforded the opportunity to play Riggs on the tour, but he 
has played Tom Brown, who was once ranked No. 1 in the United States. Lee lost 
in straight sets but did win a courtesy game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a thrill being on the same court with the man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Lee and most seniors, the tour is a family affair. They stay at each others 
homes, travel together and play together. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our best friends are on the tour," Lee said. "We get very close." 
</P>
<P>
But for brief interludes, friendships must be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"I was traveling to a tournament with my doubles partner and best friend, and 
then all of a sudden we find out we're playing each other in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
Although she lost a second-round match in straight sets in the 60s singles 
here, Lovie Beard of Houston said she was fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play people everyday at home, but I can't play these Californians all 
the time," Beard said. "I want to improve my game, and I need to play these 
top-ranked players to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the seniors, Beard took up tennis later in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a great way of staying in shape," said Beard, who also runs 
three miles a day and works part-time as a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest advantage out there is my physical ability." 
</P>
<P>
At 66, Beard said she's still attempting to pass some of the old pros who 
played junior tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of (the late bloomers) know they're not going to win," she said. "I don't 
think you can catch up. They may have lost a bit in some areas, but they've 
still got the touch. In the five-minute warmup, they pick all your faults out 
before the match has even started." 
</P>
<P>
Vilma Gordon of Santa Barbara did not play junior tennis either, but somehow 
her game has caught up. Self-taught, Gordon began playing 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out here to see how far I could go," said Gordon, seeded second in this 
week's National Hardcourt Championships in the 60s singles (she advanced to the 
quarterfinals Thursday with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Catherine Duke of Encino). 
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, Gordon has won a handful of national hardcourt titles and 
has been ranked among the top 10 nationally in singles and doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon says the key to her success has been her athleticism. Gordon is a former 
"fronton tennis player" -- a version of racquetball -- and basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of women don't like to hit an overhead, but I do," she said. "A lot of 
women don't like to serve and volley, but I do. I'm a good athlete, and that 
gets me by. Most of the players like to stay back and play on the baseline and 
expend less energy. What they don't realize is it takes more energy to play 
long baseline points than it does to come to the net and get the point over 
with." 
</P>
<P>
How long will Gordon continue to charge the net? 
</P>
<P>
"Until I drop dead, because I love it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GRANT OKD TO STUDY VENICE PIER REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved a $30,000 grant from the state Coastal 
Conservancy this week to pay half the cost of an engineering study on the 
deteriorating Venice Pier, which was closed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Breitbart, assistant general manager of the city Recreation and Parks 
Department, said a consultant is expected to be selected within two weeks. 
Results of the study are due in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Breitbart said the study will determine the extent of damage to the 
1,200-foot-long, reinforced concrete-and-steel pier. He said the study also 
will look at the costs of repairing and replacing the pier. 
</P>
<P>
The other half of the money will come from $500,000 that already had been 
approved for demolition of the pier. The Coastal Conservancy is a state agency 
charged with preserving coastal resources. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old pier was closed in November, 1986, after pieces of concrete 
fell off. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers found that salt water had corroded the steel frame and that the 
rusted steel was expanding, causing the concrete to break.

MAN DROWNS, BROTHER IS SWEPT TO SEA ON OUTING AT BLACK'S BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A relaxing afternoon at Black's Beach in La Jolla turned deadly for a group of 
friends Thursday when one member of the party drowned and his brother was swept 
out to sea by powerful riptides. 
</P>
<P>
Florentino Pineda Bonilla, 19, was pronounced dead at Scripps Memorial Hospital 
in La Jolla at 3:50 p.m. after efforts to resuscitate him failed. His 
25-year-old brother, Jose Guadalupe Bonilla, was listed as missing Thursday 
night after a fruitless search by lifeguard boats and a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonilla brothers, who had been staying in San Diego, lived in the Mexican 
state of Oaxaca and had limited swimming skills, their friends told 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner Cal Vine said the two men were wading in waist-deep water about 
2 p.m. when they apparently stepped in a hole and lost their footing. Friends 
spotted Florentino in the rough surf and pulled him onto the sand, where a 
passer-by identified as Chris Andrews performed CPR, lifeguards said. 
</P>
<P>
Another beachgoer, meanwhile, climbed the rocky cliffs overlooking Black's 
Beach to summon help, and lifeguards from the La Jolla Shores station arrived 
on the scene just before 3 p.m., according to supervising lifeguard Lt. Brant 
Bass. 
</P>
<P>
Florentino was taken by Life Flight helicopter to Scripps, where he was 
declared dead 20 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers on a U. S. Coast Guard helicopter and two boats from the lifeguard 
headquarters in Mission Bay failed to turn up any sign of Jose Guadalupe. Their 
hunt was called off about 4 p.m. and will not resume today. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards said the brothers had been wading on a state-owned stretch of the 
popular beach below the Torrey Pines Glider Port. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safe to assume these individuals . . . were non-swimmers," lifeguard Matt 
Rowland said.

NATIONAL GUARD TO AID CUSTOMS IN WAR ON DRUGS AT PORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 300 California National Guard members will join U. S. Customs Service 
inspectors at the Ports of San Diego, Los Angeles and Long Beach starting this 
weekend in a stepped-up program to find narcotics being smuggled into the 
country on foreign ships, guard officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the soldiers will assist custom inspectors in searching containers and 
other cargo, they will not be armed and will have no authority to make arrests. 
The program is slated to last four weeks and will be financed by a $1-million 
federal grant, part of $40 million allocated by Congress for drug interdiction 
by the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
California National Guard Maj. Steve Mensik said during a press conference at 
the Armed Forces Reserve Center at Los Alamitos that an estimated 30% of all 
illegal drugs smuggled into the country arrive in containerized cargo. The 
adjacent Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are two of the largest on the West 
Coast. Combined, they are the busiest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trained to Spot Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Guard members from throughout the state who volunteer for the anti-drug 
program, Mensik said, will be given a four-hour course on how to spot illegal 
drugs. The duty will last for two weeks, and soldiers will come from as far 
north as Mt. Shasta and as far south as San Diego. All of them will be 
processed and receive their training at the National Guard facilities at Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"Any discoveries of illegal drugs will be reported to custom officials who will 
decide on the appropriate action to take," Mensik said. "We will be supporting 
customs only." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is virtually no chance that the Guard members would come in 
contact with smugglers or drug dealers in this program, Mensik still described 
the Guard role as "low-intensity combat." But he said the program would be 
confined to the seaports and no Guard member would be crossing the border into 
Mexico or riding in helicopters patrolling the border. 
</P>
<P>
Mensik said no particular country or its ships have been targeted for search. 
"Drugs come in from all countries, Europe and South America," he said, adding 
that the program will last four weeks because that will cover the ships that 
were already at sea and bound for the United States before the program was 
announced to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo inspection program is not the first time the Guard has been involved 
in drug interdiction, Mensik said. As far back as 1983, the Guard supplied 
helicopters and crews to the state in its search for marijuana fields in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Guard helicopters and crews were used by law enforcement in a 
long-term surveillance in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The idea to use National Guard troops to deter drug trafficking was first 
proposed in 1986 by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado). Although some officials 
condemned the plan as extreme and dangerous, a bill later sponsored by Hunter 
led to the use of military planes to help the Border Patrol detect illegal 
border crossings by aircraft.

OFFICER WOUNDS SUSPECT AFTER SOUTHEAST S.D. CAR CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old man was listed in serious condition Thursday after being shot by 
a San Diego police officer who thought the man was reaching for a gun, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Taylor had his hands in the air as he was being arrested on suspicion 
of drug activity, but suddenly dropped his hands toward his waistband, 
prompting Officer Al Dobynes to shoot Taylor in the left side, Lt. Phil Jarvis 
said. Taylor was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Dobynes and Officer Marc Hoffman were on patrol in Southeast San Diego about 1 
a.m. Thursday when they saw a car parked in an alley near 44th and T streets. 
There were two people inside the car and several people standing around it, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
When Dobynes aimed the patrol car's searchlight at the parked car the crowd 
scattered and the car sped off, turning onto 43rd Street. Shortly after running 
a red light at National Avenue, Taylor, who was driving, slammed on the brakes 
and skidded onto the sidewalk at 43rd and Delta streets, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in the car fled west on Delta and escaped, but police said they 
found Taylor hiding nearby in a bank of ivy. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Dave Cohen said Dobynes saw Taylor and ordered him to stand 
and put his hands in the air. Taylor stood facing away from Dobynes. Cohen said 
Taylor then abruptly dropped his hands to his waistband and turned to the left. 
Believing Taylor had a gun, Dobynes fired one shot from his .38-caliber 
revolver, hitting Taylor, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis said a plastic bag containing "35 to 40 rocks" of cocaine was found in 
Taylor's mouth. Taylor will be heldd on suspicion of possessing drugs for sale, 
Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was previously from Los Angeles, police said, but because he used 
several aliases and addresses, it was not clear where he lives in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As is customary, Dobynes has been placed on administrative duty, Jarvis said, 
until the investigation is complete.

COUNCIL MEMBERS GET BERNSON'S-EYE VIEW OF DISTRICT DURING TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson took seven council colleagues on a field trip through 
the north San Fernando Valley Thursday, showing them good, bad and 
controversial venues in his district. 
</P>
<P>
The council members and several city department heads settled in big tour bus 
seats and listened to Bernson, with microphone in hand, explain his position on 
issues such as the Porter Ranch development area and the Bryant Street-Vanalden 
Avenue neighborhood redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
For several council members, the daylong tour was the first time they had seen 
the controversial projects, which they have either voted on in the past or will 
make critical decisions about in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's offered me a tour like this before," said Ruth Galanter, a first-term 
councilwoman who represents Westchester, Venice and Crenshaw communities. "This 
is important because we each represent districts that are so different, but the 
problems such as traffic and development are generic throughout the city." 
</P>
<P>
One of the longest stops was at Porter Ranch, where a plan to develop the 
pristine rolling hills into a major $2-billion residential and commercial city 
center is at the forefront of public debate. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles city Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the master 
plan for the 1,300-acre Chatsworth site May 11. The development plan will go 
next to the council's Planning and Environment Committee, which Bernson chairs, 
and then to the full City Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endorses Plan 
</P>
<P>
Standing before his colleagues, Bernson endorsed the plan as "in balance and 
reasonable," adding that he supports a 20% cut in the project's commercial area 
from 7.5 million square feet to about 6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills developer Nathan Shapell also is seeking to build 2,195 
single-family houses and 800 condominiums on the site over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest crime will be to allow this to be developed piecemeal," Bernson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter and Councilman Michael Woo, another tour participant, are both members 
of the council's powerful Planning and Environment Committee. Neither had seen 
the site before. They said they have not yet studied the plan in detail. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, an environmentalist who was elected on a wave of slow-growth 
sentiment, said that evaluating the Porter Ranch plan "will be a challenge. I 
was standing there trying to imagine those hills covered with buildings." 
</P>
<P>
After viewing the site, Woo said it is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no sense of it before this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch was served at the lavish Mediterranean-style mansion of Ray Mulokas, 
president of the 60-home Monteria Estates Assn. and a member of Bernson's 
citizen advisory committee on the Porter Ranch development proposal. The 
committee has endorsed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Bernson said mini-malls and corner businesses with tiny 
parking lots are bad. One venue on his "Points of Interest" map was the 
hamburger stand at Balboa Boulevard and Lassen Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this is extremely popular," Bernson said, "Traffic backs up all 
along Balboa." 
</P>
<P>
When the entourage stopped to walk through the Bryant-Vanalden neighborhood in 
Northridge, the city's largest housing rehabilitation project, Bernson heaped 
praise on his efforts that transformed "some of the worst slums in L.A." into 
an "ornate gated community." 
</P>
<P>
Council members walked through vacant and occupied units that were newly 
renovated and through a vandalized unit. 
</P>
<P>
They were not shown an example of one of the 160 units that the city Community 
Development Department cited two months ago for slum-like conditions. The city 
ordered the developer, Devinder (Dave) Vadehra, to repair the units, or the 
city will do so at his expense. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Esparza, Community Development Department housing director, said his 
office is inspecting the units and preparing a final audit of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The tour was not unique. In 1981, council members took monthly tours to 
different districts. Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, whose district stretches 
from San Pedro to Watts, said that was the last time she had journeyed to the 
opposite end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"So much comes before the council, it's good when you can at least visualize 
some of the places," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the tour were council members Joel Wachs, Joy Picus, John 
Ferraro and Marvin Braude.

COCAINE FOUND IN BACKPACK WAS 'YUCKY,' GIRLS TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three second-graders described in Van Nuys Superior Court Thursday how they 
took turns sampling "yucky"-tasting cocaine found in a classmate's backpack, 
then told friends it was good in order to trick them into trying it. 
</P>
<P>
After nine students at Canoga Park Lutheran School had tasted the powdery 
substance -- including one who said it made her tongue numb -- the fun ended 
abruptly when a sixth-grader grabbed the cocaine and turned it in to the 
principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
The girls told their stories on the first day of the trial of Maria Christina 
Torres, 39, on charges of child endangerment and possession of cocaine for 
sale. Police said she had hidden the drugs in her daughter's backpack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7-Year Term 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Torres, a Colombian citizen who lives in Topanga Canyon, could be 
sentenced to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-year-old Sara Comden, one of the three who were called to the stand to 
describe the June 13 episode, said she and several others who sampled the 
"icky" powder "spit it right out on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
All three said they had no idea at the time what the substance was. 
</P>
<P>
Sara also testified that shortly after the white powder was taken away, Maria 
Torres arrived at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-year-old testified that Torres was "mad, kind of" and demanded that her 
daughter Angelina produce the clear bag holding the powder. 
</P>
<P>
She quoted Torres as saying, "Give it! Give it! Give it to me!" after failing 
to find the bag in the backpack. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony at Torres' preliminary hearing in August, school 
officials called police after the mother left the school. When police 
determined that the powder was cocaine, the nine children who had sampled the 
drug were taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Although all the children were found to be unharmed, authorities said that if 
they had swallowed a larger amount of the cocaine, they might have died. 
</P>
<P>
Torres was arrested when she came to pick up her daughter at the end of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tracy Watson told jurors that the arresting officers found 
three telephone pagers, additional plastic bags and about $1,000 in cash -- 
which she said were all indications of drug dealing -- on Torres when she was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Richard A. Walton, who chose not to make an opening statement 
at the start of testimony, has given no indication what the defense strategy 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
Torres has been free on $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony resumes Monday in Judge Alan B. Haber's courtroom.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO-SMOKING LAW DRAFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smoking will be banned in city-owned buildings and public areas of banks, 
restaurants and other establishments under a new law drafted by El Segundo 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Council members are expected to adopt the ordinance when they meet May 16. It 
will go into effect 30 days later. 
</P>
<P>
City regulations will follow those advocated by Americans for Non-Smokers 
Rights, which lobbied council members to draft the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Besides prohibiting smoking in city buildings and public areas, the ordinance 
will require restaurants with more than 40 seats to create a nonsmoking area. 
Eateries with fewer than 40 seats will be required to post a sign telling 
customers whether smoking is allowed or prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Also, employers must maintain nonsmoking areas in lounges and cafeterias, and 
establish smoke-free areas for nonsmokers "to the maximum extent possible." 
Employers will not be forced to create smoke-free areas if it requires them to 
incur any expenses.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AVALON OKS PACT WITH SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will continue to provide law 
enforcement services to Avalon in accord with a five-year contract approved 
unanimously Tuesday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council vote followed three months of discussion between city officials and 
sheriff's representatives over ways to improve the department's image on Santa 
Catalina Island and enhance the relationship between deputies and the 
community, said City Manager Chuck Prince. Under the agreement, the sheriff's 
station on the island will increase narcotics enforcement, replace car patrols 
on Crescent Avenue, Avalon's main street, with a foot patrol, and have the 
station commander in uniform more often, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also slightly increases the number of deputies patrolling the 
city, said Lawrence Dykhouse, sheriff's commander for the part of the county 
that includes the island. 
</P>
<P>
The final cost of the contract will be decided in June, but Prince estimated it 
at $300,000 to $350,000 a year.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAIR CLAIMING TO RUN CHURCH ARE CHARGED WITH 
PROSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canyon Country husband and wife who say they operate a church in which sexual 
acts are part of the religious services have been charged with operating a 
house of prostitution, the Los Angeles city attorney's office reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy, 51, and Mary Ellen Tracy, 46, were charged Tuesday with the 
offense, a misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to six months in jail and a 
fine of $1,000, said Deputy City Atty. Alice Hand. Mary Ellen Tracy also was 
charged with two misdemeanor counts of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys operate the Church of the Most High Goddess, in which Mary Ellen 
Tracy carries the title of high priestess, in a house in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys claim they operate a legitimate church in which high priestesses 
absolve the sins of male followers through intercourse in sexual religious 
rites that they say predate Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that the church's rites are protected by the First Amendment of 
the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they claim," Hand said. "It is a First Amendment issue and we will 
have to deal with it," if the Tracys raise that as a defense, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested the couple at the house April 11. Authorities said 
Mary Ellen Tracy asked an undercover vice officer for a $150 donation for the 
church and told him to perform oral sex on her to show his allegiance to the 
church. The Tracys were arrested after the officer refused and was ordered to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy was originally charged with pimping, but the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office declined to file the felony charge and referred his 
case to the city attorney's office.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISSING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL, TRUCK FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astolen pickup truck with a device containing low-level radioactive material 
was found abandoned Thursday night near Sylmar, the Los Angeles Police 
Department reported. The material, encased in a thick steel cage, had not 
leaked, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and firefighters temporarily closed off a three-block area around the 
site where the red Mazda was found, at Alexander Street and Gladstone Avenue in 
the Sylmar Square area. 
</P>
<P>
There was no threat to residents, and there were no plans for an evacuation, 
Los Angeles Fire Department Assistant Chief Allan Schroeder said. Schroeder 
said tests showed no signs of radioactivity in the area. Low level 
radioactivity was found only in the truck bed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A hazardous materials team and at least eight fire engines arrived at the scene 
after a resident reported the abandoned truck to police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was stolen Tuesday from a parking lot in Granada Hills, said Rasol 
Khiabani, chief engineer for the Valencia office of Leighton and Associates, a 
geo-technical consulting firm which owns the truck. 
</P>
<P>
The gauge containing the radioactive material is used to test soil moisture and 
density, Khiabani said. He said the cage could only be opened with a special 
tool owned by the manufacturer.

THE NEW YORK COMMODITIES PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
A LOOK AT THE FUTURES

<P>
As part of an investigation by the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission, 
yesterday the Postal Inspection Service served search warrants on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange. Two other New York exchanges -- the 
Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, which trades future and options contracts in 
coffee, sugar and cocoa, and the Cotton Exchange that trades future contracts 
on cotton and frozen orange juice -- are also part of the investigation. A 
futures contract involves the purchase or sale of a specific commodity at a set 
time in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at some of the items traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
and Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PALLADIUM: Palladium is often used in place of platinum because it is cheaper, 
harder, and lighter than platinum. Palladium is gaining market share in dental 
applications and is also used in ceramic capacitors and integrated circuits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PETROLEUM: Most crude oil is refined into gasoline, heating oil and other 
fuels. The remainder is converted into lubricants and raw materials such as 
asphalt, coke, industrial hydrogen and wax. Futures in crude oil, heating oil, 
and unleaded gasoline are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating 
oil is also traded on the London Commodity Exchange, where it is called gas 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLATINUM: More valuable than gold, platinum is a favorite metal for expensive 
jewelry. Because platinum is resistant to heat and chemicals, it is used by the 
automotive industry in catalytic converters, by chemical laboratories for 
containers, by the glass industry to make dies for fiberglass, and in making 
surgical instruments. In addition to the NYMEX, futures are traded on the Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange for Industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPANE: Liquified propane is mixed with butane to produce liquified petroleum 
gas (LPG), which is used as fuel in industry, trucks, and homes in isolated 
areas. Propane is an important source of ethylene, a colorless flammable gas 
and one of the most important industrial chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commodity Exchange in New York (COMEX) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALUMINUM: Because pure aluminum is soft and has little strength, it is almost 
always mixed with other elements such as copper, magnesium, and zinc to form 
aluminum alloys. A versitile metal, more aluminum is used worldwide than any 
other metal except iron or steel in products ranging from window frames and 
siding to airplanes and automobiles to beverage cans and golf clubs. Aluminum 
futures are also traded on the London Metal Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COPPER: Used for everything from rain gutters for houses to electronic guidance 
systems for space rockets, copper--as the best low-cost conductor of 
electricity--is heavily used in the electrical industry. Copper can be combined 
with other metals to create brass and bronze. Futures are also traded on the 
MidAmerica Exchange in Chicago. Cash and futures are traded on the London Metal 
Exchange; options are traded in both New York and London. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GOLD: Jewelry consumes almost half of gold used in the U.S., with New York 
being one of the centers of U.S. jewelry manufacturing. Other uses for gold 
include electronics and other industrial applications, dental. About 1 percent 
of gold is formed into small bars and privately minted investment items such as 
gold coins. Gold futures and options are traded on the Commodity Exchange COMEX 
in New York. Futures are also traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago 
International Monetary Market, and on commodity exchanges in Winnipeg, Sydney, 
and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SILVER: The major silver consumer is the photography industry. Used in 
electrical and electronic products for contacts and conductors, silver is also 
used in batteries, sterling tableware, jewelry, mirrors, coins, for medical and 
dental uses, and in brazing alloys and solder. Silver futures are also traded 
on the Chicago Board of Trade, the MidAmerica Exchange, the London Metal 
Exchange, and in Winnipeg.

CONSUMER GROUP SAYS AIR FARE WARS NEED ENCOURAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Common Cause warned Thursday that the new low air fares now 
available on flights between Northern and Southern California might not last 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The 55,000-member public interest group advised consumers to examine the 
motives behind the fare reductions, which come after about 18 months of fare 
increases ranging up to 200%. Also, Common Cause stressed that low fares will 
remain only if consumers find ways to encourage more competition on intrastate 
routes now dominated by USAir, American, United and Delta. California has not 
seen such low fares since the years when PSA and Air Cal competed aggressively 
for intrastate passengers before they were gobbled up by USAir and American in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite this week's reductions, we're concerned that the long-term direction 
in California intrastate routes might be toward less, not more, airline 
competition, and towards higher, not lower, fares," said Common Cause Executive 
Director Walter Zelman. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Airlines, a Dallas-based regional serving 30 cities nationwide, 
started the fare-cutting by stating in early April that it would inaugurate its 
service to Oakland with an unrestricted $98 round-trip fare for the routes from 
the East Bay airport to the Ontario airport in San Bernardino County and to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But the round of price cutting got under way in earnest last week when American 
announced a $98, seven-day advance purchase, round-trip fare between three 
popular Southern California airports and two Northern California airports. 
</P>
<P>
The major carriers quickly followed suit, including making an attempt to match 
an earlier $58, 21-day advance purchase fare implemented by Southwest Airlines 
for certain routes. USAir most recently extended the cuts further, in 
particular extending the previously unavailable $58 fare to passengers 
departing Los Angeles International for Oakland and providing an alternative 
$78 advance purchase fare on several other North-South routes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Rise Elsewhere 
</P>
<P>
All of the major carriers have now matched USAir's $78 fare. The fares 
announced in recent days are substantial reductions from the previously 
prevailing $124 advanced purchase ticket and a regular $296 fare on North-South 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
While there is a wave of price competition here now, prices are rising 
elsewhere. According to the Air Transport Assn., an airline industry trade 
group, on the average air fares across the nation are rising dramatically. 
Analysts say rising crude oil prices may be a major factor. The corridor 
between Northern and Southern California is the nation's busiest with more than 
200 flights a day and an estimated 2.1 million people flying annually between 
the Los Angeles and San Francisco airports alone. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that these new reductions by major carriers simply reflect the 
need to match fares of a new competitor, the competitive mechanism may be 
working as expected," Zelman said. "But to the extent that they represent an 
effort to warn Southwest or other potential competitors that the major airlines 
will do anything necessary to prevent new entrants into intrastate markets, 
today's air fare wars could have long-term negative effects on California air 
fares." 
</P>
<P>
If the motive was to scare away competition, then the low fares will be a 
fleeting phenomenon, Zelman said. He said the airlines should be monitored 
closely because if they are losing money on the new fares, then questions of 
possible antitrust violations can be raised. "If airlines can make reasonable 
profits at $120 or $200 round-trip between Los Angeles and the Bay Area, what 
were they making last week at $300?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encourage Competition 
</P>
<P>
The fact that fares in California did not decrease until Southwest opened up 
routes from Southern California to Oakland proves the need for more 
competition, Zelman said. All of Common Cause's research indicates that the 
major airlines "competed with each other less aggressively" before Southwest 
entered the picture, he said. The city of Oakland did everything it could to 
encourage Southwest to serve the airport, he said. "Oakland enticed Southwest 
with the results that we're now seeing. Maybe it's worth some cities' while to 
think about getting more gates (at their airports) and enticing small airlines 
into the market," he added. 
</P>
<P>
American didn't react to Southwest, said spokesman Ed Stewart. "Since we 
inherited the Air Cal routes we have been constantly reevaluating fares." The 
new fares are here to stay for "the foreseeable future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
USAir said it reduced fares for a variety of reasons, including the necessity 
of matching the American fare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
How long the fares will last "is hard to say," said a USAir spokesman. He 
asserted that the low PSA and Air Cal fares were "unrealistic." The fare level 
just prior to the recent reductions were just coming up to the national level, 
he said.

RISKY BUSINESS: HOW THE FUTURES MARKETS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arrival of federal agents on the floors of four New York commodity 
exchanges Thursday drew public attention once again to the risky and 
little-understood world of futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
The morning raids took place at the offices and trading pits on the eighth and 
ninth floors of a tower at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, where 
five New York exchanges trade futures on commodities ranging from oil to frozen 
orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges involved in Thursday's activity -- the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, the New York Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa 
Exchange, and the Cotton Exchange -- are among 12 such exchanges operating in 
the United States. They operate something akin to the better-known New York or 
American stock exchanges 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trading stocks, however, these financial markets deal with the 
trading of "futures contracts" for a variety of products, such as agricultural 
commodities, precious metals, foreign currencies and Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts are bought and sold on sprawling floors by traders shouting 
orders in chaotic pits, which are monitored by officials from the individual 
exchanges and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that 
regulates such activity. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chicago's exchanges are the largest, New York's exchanges are growing. 
The New York Mercantile Exchange has gained prominence with its crude oil, 
gasoline and heating oil contracts, and the Commodity Exchange is best known 
for its gold and silver trades. 
</P>
<P>
Futures trading brings together two highly divergent groups: hedgers, such as 
farmers, bankers and utilities, who want to protect the value of their 
commodities in changing markets, and speculators, who don't hold the 
commodities but hope to turn a profit on the price swings. 
</P>
<P>
The futures contract is an agreement, usually between a speculator and hedger. 
The contract specifies how much of a commodity will be delivered, and at what 
price, on a specific date some weeks or months hence. 
</P>
<P>
Contracts cover a standard amount of a commodity, say 100 ounces of gold or 
40,000 pounds of pork bellies; the value can range from $10,000 to $1 million. 
But a participant need put down only a small percentage of a contract's value, 
an amount called the margin, before settlement, in which the goods are 
exchanged between buyer and seller. Only about 3% of the contracts actually are 
settled with an exchange of the commodity. 
</P>
<P>
A wheat grower, for example, who needs $4 a bushel to break even can protect 
himself against falling prices by getting into a futures contract that requires 
him to deliver 100,000 bushels of wheat at $4 each on a specified date to a 
speculator who buys the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Although the grower may have no intention of actually selling his wheat to the 
speculator, he has guaranteed himself a $4-a-bushel price. He may sell his 
wheat to the mill at market prices. But even if that price has fallen to $2 a 
bushel, the grower's loss is offset by his gain on the futures contract. 
</P>
<P>
The speculator in this example, meanwhile, is betting on the price of wheat to 
increase. Say a wheat shortage causes the price to rise to $6 a bushel. In the 
end, the farmer still breaks even by receiving $4 a bushel and the speculator 
takes the $2 profit. 
</P>
<P>
Thus news of droughts, oil spills or other events that may affect future 
supplies of traded commodities can send futures prices careening wildly up and 
down from hour to hour. 
</P>
<P>
Though potential profits from such trading are impressive, the risks are quite 
high as well. Because of the way the futures markets work, a swing of just a 
penny in the price of a commodity could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands 
of dollars to the speculator. 
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that as many as 90% of individual investors who venture 
into the futures markets come out losers. 
</P>
<P>
The average investor "should definitely stay away from them," said Peter 
Ritchken, an associate professor of finance at USC. "They are taking a lot of 
risk."

S. J. DIAMOND: BUYER SHOULD BE WARY OF BANNERS, LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are the red flags of retailing: "IRREGULAR" stamped on the collar, 
"SECOND" across the package, "AS IS" scribbled on the label. Everyone knows 
they're warnings. 
</P>
<P>
There are others, only suspected, because they seem not warnings but come-ons: 
Closeout, Clearance, Liquidation, Discount or Off-Price. Even Regular, 
Original, or Usual price. And sometimes: "Wholesale." 
</P>
<P>
But none has uniform or official definitions. They are words of art, not law, 
and their application follows retail custom rather than rule. Unfortunately, 
this makes it difficult for the consumer to read them, and retailers who use 
them aren't eager to discuss them. Clearly, their use demands attention. 
</P>
<P>
SECONDS, or "factory seconds," are not first quality and are therefore pulled 
off the line at the factory. Usually, goods so labeled have only minor, barely 
perceptible flaws. 
</P>
<P>
There are flaws, for example, that make garments "not perfect," says Joseph 
Siegel, vice president of merchandising at the National Retail Merchants Assn. 
in New York, "but don't affect wearability." It could be a dye lot mistake, or 
a "slub" -- a thickening in the weave due to a doubled or tripled thread -- or 
perhaps "an uneven pattern," says Edgar Dworsky, spokesman for the 
Massachusetts Executive Office of Consumer Affairs, "or the stripes on a pocket 
not lined up with the stripes on a shirt." 
</P>
<P>
IRREGULAR is sometimes synonymous with seconds, sometimes applied to everything 
below seconds ("thirds" and "fourths" within some industries), and sometimes to 
all imperfect goods. Thus, irregular sheets and towels could look flawless or 
have a foot-long tear. 
</P>
<P>
Some stores avoid the words, coyly posting sale prices and noting, "If perfect, 
regular price would be . . ." Filene's Basement, Boston's famous markdown 
specialist, labels all irregular goods "Nearly Perfect." 
</P>
<P>
AS IS, a warning sometimes accompanied by a pin or tape marking the flaw, is 
the flag "one should pay most attention to," says Gary Walker, spokesman for 
New York's Consumer Affairs Department. Usually, as-is merchandise was damaged, 
says Siegel, "while in the retailer's possession." Often the actual damage is 
unknown, as in a demonstration model that has been on display for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Some retailers think "As Is" serves automatic notice that goods are not 
returnable. But this is neither justified nor customary at good stores; New 
York City, for one, requires specific warning that an item can't be returned. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the law -- federal, state or local -- doesn't dictate the terms for 
less-than-perfect goods but requires disclosure. It's deceptive to pass off as 
brand-new, first-quality merchandise something that's second-hand, used, 
defective, seconds or blemished. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-PRICE vs. DISCOUNT: As labels, they're pure connotation: "What do you want 
to call yourself?" says Siegel. Originally, he says, discounters "were 
hard-goods stores, selling name brands at minus-list prices," and later, chains 
selling "basement goods" at low markups. "Off-price" stores, a mid-1970s 
concept, paid low prices for quality name-brand and designer garments that had 
been overproduced, then sold them "off-price." 
</P>
<P>
"Off-Price" still sounds tonier to most shoppers, if less than it did. So one 
New York chain, says Siegel, now says it's not a discounter, not even an 
off-pricer, just a "very aggressive retailer." 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL PURCHASE describes goods the retailer "doesn't normally carry," says 
Dworsky, "but he got a good deal on the item" -- for buying in volume, odd 
colors or maybe out of season. In other words, at another time, under other 
circumstances, and on other goods, the store would charge more. Big deal. 
</P>
<P>
CLEARANCE means a retailer wants to get rid of a whole line, or several lines, 
and has drastically cut prices; the stuff never moved well, or its season is 
over. But there are stores, says Gary Walker, that deceptively advertise " 
'Clearing out all merchandise!' and they're just referring to what everyone 
would like to do every day." 
</P>
<P>
CLOSEOUTS may be goods a manufacturer discontinued, ostensibly selling them 
cheap, or items that the retailer will no longer be carrying. A retailer could 
also be closing out or liquidating his whole business -- the ultimate 
clearance, implying the ultimate in bargains. 
</P>
<P>
If the liquidation (LIQUIDATION!) is real, says Gary Walker, one must remember 
"that the store will disappear along with the inventory, and (dissatisfied) 
buyers will have nowhere to complain." Some liquidations are deceptive: There 
are retailers who "liquidate" selected stock, at supposed sale prices, every 
month. Municipal ordinances may require licenses for going-out-of-business 
sales, checking that the retailer actually closes down, but surveillance and 
enforcement is impractical, if not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
REGULAR price, as in "Regularly $100, now $59.99!" is supposedly the price at 
which regularly carried merchandise is regularly sold, even after the sale. But 
it could also be the price at which it is briefly listed between sales or the 
price at which it would be sold if it could sell at normal markup, or just a 
bogus high price marked on the ticket so $59.99 can be called a $40.01 saving. 
</P>
<P>
ORIGINAL price, similarly, is supposedly the price at which something was first 
offered. It may have been for only a minute, and may never have sold at that 
price, or may have been marked down to $89.99 and $79.99 in between, but there 
it is: "Original price $100, Sale Price $59.99." 
</P>
<P>
USUAL price is the price supposedly asked by competitors. It may be asked by 
only one competitor, or may be a "composite" price of similar or comparable 
goods. No matter: "Usual price, $100, Our price, $59.99." 
</P>
<P>
There have been periodic efforts to regulate comparative price advertising -- 
setting the number of days a price must prevail to be called "regular," or the 
number of sales made at that price, or the number of competitors selling it for 
that. But no definitions have been precise enough for retailers to follow with 
impunity, or general enough to be easily applied, leaving everyone time to get 
other work done. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's WHOLESALE TO THE PUBLIC, "a come-on," says Dworsky, "that 
implies prices as low as wholesale and isn't true." Anyone selling to the 
public is retailing and is unlikely to sell goods at exactly his cost. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, there are common warnings sounded by banners and flags alike, not 
least of which is that all of them raise questions. One should ask them.

The Bush Administration says it might prohibit airline passengers from taking 
aboard portable computers, tape players, hair dryers and other electronic 
devices as a stopgap measure against terrorist bombings. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, covering items carried by hand or in luggage, would prevent such items 
from being used to smuggle plastic explosives aboard planes until sophisticated 
bomb-detection devices can be installed at high-risk airports around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Both Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and his deputy secretary, Elaine 
Chao, raised the possibility of a total ban on electronic devices in forums 
this week. Chao said Wednesday that it could include everything from hair 
dryers and electric shavers to laptop computers and portable tape players. 
</P>
<P>
"A total ban is an option that we'll have to consider," she said, adding that 
other alternatives also were being discussed both in the United States and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relatives Ask for Ban 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103 asked that radio-cassette players and similar devices be banned 
after officials concluded that plastic explosives concealed in such a unit blew 
up the plane over Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Existing X-ray units used for hand-carried items cannot detect plastic 
explosives, and checked-in luggage usually is not scanned at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department has ordered airlines to buy and install devices 
that can detect plastic bombs, such as thermal neutron analysis units, which 
have been tested by the Federal Aviation Administration on checked-in luggage. 
Skinner said the first unit will be installed at John F. Kennedy International 
Airport in July and another one in Great Britain later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
But officials acknowledge that it could take two years or more to set up the 
$1-million units in all high-risk airports. 
</P>
<P>
A bill passed by a congressional subcommittee on Tuesday would have the 
government grant airlines and airports $270 million to pay for the units. The 
Administration insists that the airlines should pay, adding the cost to a 
security fee collected with airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said President Bush, who met with a group of the Flight 103 relatives 
last month, has been pressing him on the issue of electronic devices. The 
secretary said he also took it up with European transportation officials during 
his visits to five countries last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Compromise Safety' 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to develop a program that's going to work on electronic 
devices, it's got to work with other nations," Skinner said in a National Press 
Club speech. 
</P>
<P>
"All governments agreed to work to develop a standard program," Skinner said. 
He noted that many journalists regularly travel with portable computers and 
other devices that might be affected if a ban were imposed.

Passenger complaints against the nation's airlines continued to decline last 
month, according to the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The department, in its monthly Air Travel Consumer Report released Wednesday, 
said Pan American, Trans World and Hawaiian airlines topped the complaint list. 
</P>
<P>
The department said Pan Am received 7.58 complaints per 100,000 passengers in 
April, TWA 6.91 and Hawaiian 6.53. All were well below last year's figures for 
each airline. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, complaints received by the department against airlines declined from 
970 in March to 933 in April. There were 2,100 in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The most dissatisfaction a year ago was reported against Continental Airlines, 
with 14.94 per 100,000 passengers, and Eastern Airlines, with 12.48. Both 
airlines are owned by Texas Air Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, which has shut down most of its operations because of a strike, 
received 1.83 complaints per 100,000 passengers last month, and Continental 
3.91. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 largest carriers reported that 72.3% of their flights operated on time 
in March, the latest month for which statistics were available. The February 
figure was 72.4%. Eastern was not included in the latest report because of the 
strike, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Mishandled baggage reports filed against the carriers in March increased to 
7.53 per 1,000 passengers from 7.36 in February, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ON-TIME PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
Percentage of flights in March arriving on time. That is defined as arriving 
within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. Eastern Airlines, which led the 
February list, is not included because its operations were severely reduced by 
a strike.

Takeover Rumors Propel Wang Stock: Wang Laboratories stock jumped in heavy 
trading as traders speculated that Xerox might seek to buy it to avoid being 
taken over itself. Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., had no comment on the activity 
of its stock, which advanced $1 a share to $8.75 in heavy trading of 2.4 
million shares on the American Stock Exchange. But analysts saw a logical fit, 
with both firms having a wide array of office products. "Since Xerox has been 
viewed as a takeover candidate, it would make sense for them to acquire a 
financially troubled company to make themselves less attractive," an analyst 
said.

KARCHER INSIDE TRADING ACCORD RUNS INTO SNAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl N. Karcher's proposed settlement of an insider trading lawsuit has hit a 
serious snag after the U.S. attorney's office refused to guarantee that it will 
not file criminal charges against the Orange County businessman, sources close 
to the case said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement reached Monday hinged on Karcher's lawyers winning an 
agreement from the Justice Department that Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr. 
hamburger chain, would not be the target of a later criminal prosecution for 
insider trading, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
But federal prosecutors have declined to give that assurance and instead have 
taken a wait-and-see approach, saying they are not ready to make that decision, 
several sources close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors "want to evaluate the evidence and the case" and will decide how to 
proceed sometime before the statute of limitations runs out in October, a 
source familiar with the negotiations said. 
</P>
<P>
That stance, sources said, could kill the agreement, which was reached the day 
Karcher and six of his relatives were to begin trial in Los Angeles on charges 
of insider trading filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
When the agreement was reached Monday, lawyers on both sides said that an 
unspecified "obstacle" needed to be hurdled. But SEC and defense lawyers said 
they were optimistic that a final agreement would be reached within the week. 
</P>
<P>
Further details of the tentative agreement were revealed Thursday. It calls for 
Carl Karcher to pay a fine of $332,000, the amount his relatives saved by 
selling company stock after Karcher allegedly told them that the fast-food firm 
was about to report a dramatic drop in earnings, said individuals close to the 
case. The agreement also would require the six relatives to pay, overall, an 
additional $332,000 to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
John Koutsos, a trial counsel with the SEC, declined to discuss the terms of 
the agreement. But he said that a "fairly standard" settlement in an insider 
trading case would be for a defendant to return illegal profits plus a penalty 
of an equal amount. 
</P>
<P>
If Karcher, chief executive of Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, lost the 
civil suit, he personally could have been assessed a fine of three times the 
total amount of losses avoided, or $996,000. His six relatives could have been 
ordered to repay a total of $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filed the civil case in April, 1988, accusing Karcher, 14 family 
members and company accountant Alvin DeShano of illegal trading or tipping off 
others to avoid stock market losses. Karcher himself was accused of tipping off 
others only, not of illegal stock trading. Charges against one relative were 
dismissed while Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, was found to have been 
involved in insider trading and fined $10,500. 
</P>
<P>
Six other family members, including company President Donald Karcher, settled 
with the SEC in February by agreeing to pay $187,560. But that settlement 
included an agreement from the U.S. attorney's office that criminal charges 
would not be brought against those who settled, said lawyers involved in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
To date, only DeShano faces criminal charges of securities fraud through 
insider trading. His trial is scheduled to start May 23. 
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. attorney's office and Karcher's lawyers declined to comment on 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that after prosecutors refused to make any guarantees, Karcher's 
attorneys at the Los Angeles firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher told other 
lawyers in the case that they would seek a meeting with U.S. District Judge 
Edward Rafeedie to set a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting to see whether Gibson, Dunn is going to proceed," said Karen 
Matteson, SEC trial counsel, who otherwise declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Einhorn, SEC regional administrator, said his office is ready to try the 
civil case. "I've been here five years and haven't lost a case," Einhorn said. 
"I don't intend to lose this one. The evidence is conclusive."

B OF A SUED BY TOP FIRM IN STUDENT LOANS

<P>
First Independent Trust Co. of Sacramento filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit 
Thursday against Bank of America and the California Student Loan Finance Corp. 
alleging that they broke agreements to buy student loans. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed in Sacramento County Superior Court seeks $73 million in 
compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages for fraud, breach of 
contract and interference with economic relations. 
</P>
<P>
First Independent was one of the nation's largest lenders of guaranteed student 
loans until it stopped making new loans earlier this week, saying financing for 
some of the riskier loans had dried up. 
</P>
<P>
At the time First Independent announced its decision, however, it had been put 
on notice by state student-loan officials that it was about to be banned from 
making loans in California for widespread and continuing violations of 
student-loan program rules -- including failure to pay $4.5 million in fees 
owed to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, its largest guarantor, the nonprofit Higher Education Assistance 
Foundation in Minnesota, also has told the company that it will stop 
guaranteeing student loans it makes because of the alleged violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State's Largest Such Lender 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, First Independent has been one of the nation's most aggressive 
lenders in the student-loan business, making $1.5 billion in loans. Many were 
risky loans to students in vocational schools, who student-loan officials say 
have a default rate of from 30% to 40% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
It has been the state's largest student-loan lender over the past three years. 
During the past academic year, First Independent Trust Co. made $739 million in 
student loans to 295,000 students attending 1,500 schools in California and 43 
other states.

<P>
The stock market recorded another small decline Thursday, continuing its 
weeklong pullback as traders awaited the government's monthly employment 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down 25.10 points from Monday through 
Wednesday, dropped 8.80 to 2,384.90. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 667 up, 728 down and 555 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 153.13 million shares, down from 
171.69 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in 
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and 
in the over-the-counter market, totaled 181.21 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's attention has focused all week on today's scheduled report from 
the Labor Department on the employment situation for April. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the data to serve as evidence of whether the economy continued 
to slow last month after giving evidence of losing some momentum in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes have been increasing on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve is 
succeeding in its campaign to cool down inflation without tightening credit so 
much as to cause a recession. 
</P>
<P>
But that belief was challenged at the start of this week when a trade 
association of corporate purchasing managers reported that business activity 
picked up in April. 
</P>
<P>
Advance estimates call for the employment report to show an increase of 225,000 
to 250,000 in non-farm payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 3,043.377, down 1.302. 
</P>
<P>
Large blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 3,389, 
compared to 3,575 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were also at a near stand-still as traders stayed on the sidelines 
in anticipation the employment figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 3/32 point, or nearly $1 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in an opposite direction from its 
price, fell to 8.99% from 9% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices were sharply higher, with prices of selected issues 
marked up as a bit of institutional buying interest caught market makers short 
of stock. The Financial Times-stock exchange 100-share index was up 17.4 points 
at 2,123.1, its best level of the day. At its lowest, the index was up 10.6 
points shortly after the opening. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, financial markets and many businesses were closed because of a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures tumbled to new lows for the current contracts in New York, as 
traders sold heavily after London futures plunged to 13-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the spot May contract, all cocoa contracts dropped to new lows on 
the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange of New York. Active July cocoa ended 
down $44 at $1,176 a ton after hitting $1,170 in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices rose on news from London that the British North Sea pipeline, 
closed April 18 after an explosion at a pumping platform, will not resume 
pumping until May 26. The pipeline, carrying almost 500,000 barrels of oil a 
day, was expected to reopen in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark grade, surged 48 cents to 
$20.58 a barrel for June delivery. June unleaded gasoline rose 0.23 cents to 
69.62 cents a gallon and June heating oil rose 0.73 cents to 48.59 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished at varied levels against major foreign currencies as 
Federal Reserve intervention and a comment by the central bank's vice chairman 
sent mixed signals to the markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices ended with minor losses in U.S. trading after moving ahead 
overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold bullion at 
$376.70 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from Wednesday's late bid of $377.40. 
</P>
<P>
Late dollar rates in New York, compared to Wednesday rates, included: 1.69105 
Swiss francs, up from 1.68705; 1.18305 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18415; 
6.4005 French francs, up from 6.3905, and 1,384.50 Italian lire, up from

THE NEW YORK COMMODITIES PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
SILVER FUTURES SCANDAL WAS CFTC'S BIGGEST CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The commodities trading raid Thursday was the most excitement to hit the New 
York Commodities Exchange since the Hunt brothers of Dallas allegedly schemed 
to corner the silver market in 1979-80 in a wild episode that led to the crash 
of silver prices. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest market-manipulation case ever filed by the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission, the federal body behind Thursday's raids. The CFTC is still 
pressing a complaint against Nelson Bunker Hunt and W. Herbert Hunt nine years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The agency alleged that the two flamboyant scions of Texas oil wildcatter H. L. 
Hunt maintained bullion and futures positions that played a significant role in 
driving up the price of silver before the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
While amassing 63 million ounces of silver bullion, it said, they established 
huge long positions in silver futures contracts. Such contracts are agreements 
to buy the metal at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunts denied any illegality. Shortly after the crash, testifying before 
Senate and House committees, they accused the commodity exchanges of causing 
the plunge in silver prices to less than $11 an ounce from more than $50. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a major verdict last summer, a jury found that the two, and their 
brother Lamar, had illegally tried to corner the silver market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Legal Delays 
</P>
<P>
If the CFTC prevails in its own administrative complaint, filed Feb. 28, 1985, 
the two Hunts and several co-defendants could be barred from commodities 
trading and fined $100,000 for each trading violation. 
</P>
<P>
However, the CFTC case has been stalled by legal delays. The most recent was a 
stay issued last December by the federal bankruptcy judge in Dallas who 
presides over the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings filed by the two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunts, who lost an estimated $1 billion of their fortune in the 1980 silver 
market crash, sought protection of the bankruptcy court last September to avoid 
having to post a $225-million bond required for appealing a federal damage 
award against them a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is appealing the judge's ruling, contending it exceeded the 
court's authority. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tangle of damage suits stemming from investor losses in the 
silver market collapse have yielded some major results. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest development was the verdict last August by a New York jury, which 
found that the Hunts violated civil fraud, commodities and antitrust laws. They 
also found that Nelson, 62, and W. Herbert, 59, violated civil racketeering 
laws. Only Lamar, 56, who owns the Kansas City Chiefs football team, was 
cleared of racketeering allegations. 
</P>
<P>
That jury ordered the three brothers to pay more than $130 million in damages 
to Minpeco SA, a commodities company owned by the government of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRS Files Claims 
</P>
<P>
Lamar Hunt later agreed to pay $17 million to Minpeco, and on April 14 Minpeco 
and two other leading creditors of Nelson and W. Herbert Hunt filed a 
reorganization plan in which the personal assets of the two would be liquidated 
to repay more than $2 billion in debts. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Minpeco in presenting the plan to bankruptcy court were the Internal 
Revenue Service, which claims $1 billion in back taxes from the two Hunts, and 
Hanover Trust Co. The Hunts filed their own reorganization plan a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, in a settlement reached just a month ago, several brokerage houses 
agreed to pay about $45 million to settle two class-action suits filed in 1981 
and 1982 in behalf of individuals who invested during the silver speculation 
that preceded the 1980 crash. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, defendant Lamar Hunt agreed to pay another $2.75 million to 
the settlement fund. Earlier, another defendant, Banque Populaire Suisse, 
agreed to pay $9.5 million in the case.

PETER SHELTON'S ECCENTRIC SHAPES AT LA JOLLA EXHIBIT

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's something wonderfully ridiculous about a bulging belly sticking out 
from the wall right about your own belly level, and something indescribably 
poignant about a pair of lopsided, carrot-like legs. When Peter Shelton is 
clicking, his sculptures -- often made of semi-transparent wax over a visible 
metal armature -- provoke all manner of inchoate feelings in the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
Assembled in a show called "Waxworks" at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art (through June 4), a flock of these pieces from 1983-88 range in tone from 
spry and wondrous oddity to tight-lipped postmodernist severity. 
</P>
<P>
The best pieces have a certain drollness that comes from borrowing elements 
from human anatomy (like shoulders, necks, stomachs), nature (gourds, roots, 
wings) and garments (shields, collars) and mixing them up in spare, irregularly 
shaped objects made from variously obdurate and fragile-looking materials. 
Adroit placement on the wall counts, too, as do Shelton's punning titles. 
</P>
<P>
A gourd-like form ("Peckerhead") hung high on the wall sprouts a tall red 
member that sticks straight up like a handle. "Clearbelly," the plump belly 
piece, and "Pins," the dwindling legs, are also winners, as is "Littletrunk," a 
white waxy piece with a long "trunk" and tiny stubs of legs -- like a cross 
between a human figure and a tree branch. 
</P>
<P>
When Shelton falters, the works seem overly manicured in a chic-gallery way. 
</P>
<P>
"Blackboat," which looks rather like a giant half of a peanut shell with a 
polished black interior and a textured gray exterior, offers no fey conceit and 
seems too mutely elegant to pique the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"Blackwing," too, is a handsome mixed-media piece swinging out from the wall in 
an elegant dark curve, but it doesn't tease at the psyche in any of the sly 
ways Shelton has at his disposal. On the other hand, "Redwing," with its 
aerodynamic shape and wood-grained veneer, suggests a curious conflation of the 
shapes of human shoulders and arms, maple tree seed pods (the kind kids stick 
on their noses) and an airplane propeller. 
</P>
<P>
When he turns to cast metal, Shelton generally abandons the eccentric and 
puckish qualities of his mixed-media pieces. Suddenly the work becomes a 
Serious Art Object. "Ironfloater," for example, is an irregularly contoured 
rusted iron container suspended from the ceiling. It seems to aspire to be a 
lorn piece of flotsam -- once abandoned to the elements, now adrift in the air 
-- but its presentation seems so rigidly formal that it cancels out allusive 
content. 
</P>
<P>
"32th" is a group of 32 cast copper objects -- they look somewhat like giant 
teeth -- that hang (on small loops) from the undersides of a group of slender 
metal bars suspended from the ceiling. The perplexed viewer tries to find some 
Shelton-esque image or notion to hang onto here (besides the apropos silliness 
of the made-up word, thirty-tooth and perhaps a nod to the fragility of the 
human body), but the point remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Redshoulder" retains something of the artists' unexpected, fresh vision 
along with formal grace. The piece is simply a red rectangular solid pushed 
gently out of shape so that it grows "shoulders." By such simple means Shelton 
offers a delicious tension between ever-so-slightly humorous anthropormorphism 
and sober purity of line.

CULTURE COMES TO OCEAN BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS FESTIVAL ADDS NEW DIMENSION TO ONE-TIME HIPPIE HAVEN

<P>
This weekend's Peninsula Arts Festival is a strong sign that Ocean Beach is no 
longer just a funky seaside village where mellowed-out crazies amble down 
palm-lined streets humming "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida." 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, aging hippies can't afford to live here anymore," said Ron 
James, festival director and a 15-year OB resident. "The cost of houses is 
skyrocketing in Ocean Beach. The hippies that can (live here) aren't very 
hippie anymore. They work for accounting firms or law firms." 
</P>
<P>
A visitor would expect to encounter locals kicking back to the wailing sounds 
of raucous bands like the Forbidden Pigs, the Cardiff Reefers or the 
Rhumboogies. 
</P>
<P>
Or the the good-time, boogie-woogie of Tobacco Road, or maybe the scratchy 
guitar licks and rasping, bluesy voice of Tom (Cat) Courtney. 
</P>
<P>
In Ocean Beach, tie-dyed T-shirts never went out of style. Long hair still 
means shoulder length tresses, not classical music. But this weekend, Ocean 
Beach takes on a new cultural wrinkle. Culture with a capital C comes to town 
when the San Diego Symphony and the California Ballet join with all the above 
entertainers and more in the first, and a decidedly eclectic, Peninsula Arts 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 40,000 people are expected to attend the two-day music, dance, arts, 
crafts and food festival, located at Sunset-Collier Park at Nimitz and West 
Point Loma boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The festival includes more than 50 separate events: two stages with constant 
entertainment, four visual arts exhibits; crafts and food booths; and a section 
set up for wine and champagne tasting. 
</P>
<P>
The festival grew out of a desire by James and other OB residents for a 
cultural arts center. They want a repertory theater, a visual art gallery and 
space for workshops for crafts and fine arts. They also want to reach out to 
their neighbors in nearby Point Loma. The festival is a means to raise money 
for a 
</P>
<P>
cultural center and interest in the arts, James said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ocean Beach Arts Council hopes to raise the money and convince the powers 
that be to allow them to convert the vacant Dana Junior High School into a 
permanent cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
For James, the festival marks an inspired return to volunteer public service 
after four years recuperating from burnout. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, James, who is a partner in an OB T-shirt firm, helped organize two OB 
events, the Fourth of July Street Festival and the Christmas Tree Festival, 
both of which will celebrate their 10th anniversary this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a tremendous sense of pride seeing something pull the community, the 
different factions together," James said. "You see something like this grow and 
blossom. Those things leave a mark on the community. I think those are the most 
important things I will do in my life." 
</P>
<P>
During the festival, artisans will demonstrate screen printing and how to make 
paper and clay sculptures. Hands-on activities are scheduled for children, 
including a printing workshop and mural painting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Varied Lineup 
</P>
<P>
Due to limited parking, visitors are encouraged to park at Sea World and use 
the 15-minute shuttle service to Sunset-Collier Park. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is budgeted at about $50,000. It is underwritten by individual and 
business donations and rentals from food and craft booths. Though the food and 
wine are for sale, all the entertainment is free, James said. 
</P>
<P>
The varied lineup includes master folk singer Sam Hinton, a Portuguese-American 
dance group and the California Ballet, dancing excerpts from "Coppelia." 
</P>
<P>
Yoav Talmi, the symphony's new music director designate, will close the 
festival Sunday afternoon with a full-on two-hour classical concert of Mozart 
and Dvorak. Complete with a Mozart concerto by acclaimed oboist Allan Vogel, 
the concert begins at 4. 
</P>
<P>
The long days that James and about 50 festival committee members have been 
volunteering are worth the effort, said James, who loves the OB and believes in 
what the festival can add for his community. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the smell and the sounds of Ocean Beach," James said. "I wake up and 
hear the surf crashing. Ocean Beach has a sense of identity you don't find in 
other parts of the city. There's an energy, a creativity, that goes with it." 
</P>
<P>
The arts festival, he says, is helping forge a bond with OB's more upscale 
neighbors in Point Loma and with the city's mainstream population, lending 
credence to Bob Dylan lyrics: "The times, they are a changin.' "

Henry Mancini is one of six composers and songwriters who will speak during the 
"Reel Music" series beginning next month at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art. Mancini, who won an Academy Award for his music in "Victor/Victoria," will 
attend a screening of the film June 27, at the museum's Sherwood Auditorium. 
The six-film series, held at 6 Tuesday nights June 6-July 18, is sponsored by 
the Visual Arts Foundation and Great American First Savings. The series, which 
will include a reception, a film screening and a question-and-answer session 
with the composer or songwriter afterward, salutes the 75th anniversary of the 
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Others slated 
for the series are "Rocky" composer Bill Conti, songwriters Alan and Marilyn 
Bergman ("The Way We Were"), Elmer Bernstein ("To Kill a Mockingbird") and 
James Horner ("Cocoon").

The final episode of NBC's "Family Ties" May 14 will be an unusual length: 70 
minutes. The series was set to go out with a special hourlong finale, but when 
the taping came up long, NBC told the producers they could include an 
additional seven minutes of dialogue and three minutes of spontaneous farewells 
and emotional curtain calls by cast and crew members. The show will air from 
8-9:10 p.m., delaying the rest of the NBC lineup that night by 10 minutes. In 
the last episode, Alex Keaton (Michael J. Fox) leaves his parents, sisters and 
brother for a job on Wall Street. The series has been on the air since 1982.

CATALINA BIKERS TAKE THEIR LAST RIDE OVER MOUNTAIN ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The banning of mountain bike riding this week on Santa Catalina Island's 
rugged, 76-square-mile interior has upset avid cyclists who say they will miss 
riding the remote back roads of this pristine island. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disappointed," said student Gideon Rubin of San Francisco, who paid 
for a permit to join a mountain biking program in March and took a final ride 
on the island last weekend before the ban went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Catalina Conservancy, which owns most of the island, halted the 
program after an insurance company that provided coverage for the bicyclists 
dropped the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, 24, a New York native who bicycled to California in 1985, said raves 
from a fellow biker about Catalina's spectacular views and untouched terrain 
persuaded him to join the program. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours after receiving a letter that the permit program was ending at 
midnight April 30, Rubin said he hopped a bus in San Francisco for a trip to 
Los Angeles and a farewell tour of the Catalina interior. 
</P>
<P>
"I went partly because I felt it might be the last opportunity," Rubin said. 
"There were some roads I hadn't ridden and I felt I had to go back there. 
There's something very special about being on top of a mountain and seeing two 
coasts at the same time. In a weekend you feel like you've been away for a 
month." 
</P>
<P>
The ban is not in effect in the towns of Avalon and Two Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials say they have assured the 330 bikers who bought permits 
so they could traverse Catalina's interior that they will try to reopen the 
inner island to bikers as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
One possible solution is finding another insurance company to pick up coverage 
of the program, conservancy Vice President Rose Ellen Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Volume 
</P>
<P>
The insurance company that covered the program until last month -- which 
Gardner declined to name -- decided to drop coverage because "the volume of the 
premium wasn't large enough for them to write the policy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bicyclist Chuck Cotton, 70, who has led group excursions into the Catalina 
interior over the last three years, said he is disheartened but hopeful that 
the ban will be short. Cotton, who lives on Balboa Island in Orange County and 
has organized bike races throughout Southern California, said he has discussed 
ways to resolve the insurance crisis with conservancy officials. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those options include seeking insurance coverage from the county, which 
operates several public parks on Catalina, or trying to get coverage by joining 
larger bicycling organizations such as the U.S. Cycling Federation, based in 
Colorado Springs, Cotton said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see, because of liability problems, that (the conservancy) could have a 
tremendous lawsuit on their hands" if there is an accident, Cotton said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Brown of Brown's Bikes, the only shop in Avalon that sells and rents 
mountain bikes, said several bikers who stopped at his shop for equipment 
before going into the interior were upset because they had to cancel their 
rides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Kind of Sad' 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the ban would hurt his business "but not an awful lot." About 10 
people a week rent mountain bikes at the shop, but most serious cyclists bring 
their own bikes over by boat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of sad about it because I think it was a great program," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the permit program, fees were $50 a year for individuals and $75 a year 
for families, with $25 of the fee going for insurance, Gardner said. Bikers had 
to use 18-gear mountain bikes and wear helmets while riding. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner said there was never an accident under the biking program, which ran 
from May 1, 1988, to April 30, 1989. Before the program was started, bicycling 
in the interior was banned for nearly a year after conservancy officials 
concluded in July, 1987, that bikers posed too much of a danger on the steep 
grades and hairpin curves of the interior roads. 
</P>
<P>
Local bikers are contenting themselves with riding on the mainland until the 
Catalina interior reopens to bikers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's magnificent, so beautiful and pristine over there," Cotton said. "But 
bicycling has a cost. I'm all in favor of permits to ride on Catalina. It's one 
of the only places around we can kind of have all to ourselves."

WAR ON DRUGS YIELDS SPORTY SPOILS FROM CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates held an auto show of sorts in MacArthur Park on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
There was a spiffy-looking BMW sedan. A sleek Toyota sports car. A flashy 
four-wheel-drive pickup. A shiny new Mercedes-Benz convertible, complete with a 
personalized, West German license plate that read "Feeling Free." The license 
plate holder read "Life is Sweet." 
</P>
<P>
They were the sorts of vehicles that appeal to the yuppie set. 
</P>
<P>
And that, Gates said regretfully, is where a lot of them came from. 
</P>
<P>
The cars and trucks were among 38 vehicles confiscated by undercover Los 
Angeles police officers and agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
during a five-day crackdown on buyers and sellers of illegal drugs in the 
Pico-Union/Westlake/Rampart area, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said drug sales -- often to well-employed, relatively affluent 
members of Southern California's diverse community -- had turned the park and 
its environs into a "blatant narcotics bazaar." 
</P>
<P>
Among the 35 adults arrested on suspicion of purchasing illegal drugs: 
</P>
<P>
* A 28-year-old secretary at USC, booked on a marijuana count. Her brand-new 
Toyota was seized. 
</P>
<P>
* A Hacienda Heights couple, 20 and 21, who brought their 2 1/2-year-old child 
with them on a marijuana-buying trip. Their sports truck was seized. 
</P>
<P>
* Two paralegals, 20 and 26, each booked on a marijuana count. "We come here 
because it is so convenient," one of the women reportedly told police. "This 
area is known everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
* Two Japanese citizens, 27 and 25, who were visiting Los Angeles on their 
honeymoon. Police said a tour guide took them to the park area after they asked 
him, "Where in Los Angeles do you buy marijuana?" All three were booked on 
marijuana counts. The guide's sedan was seized. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said these and the other purchasers -- most of them white-collar 
professionals -- contrast starkly with the army of small-time drug vendors, 
most of whom are unemployed, homeless men from the tough neighborhood that 
surrounds the park. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 20 suspected sellers were arrested during the crackdown. Gates said 
many of them were undocumented aliens from Mexico and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles were seized under federal forfeiture laws that permit police to 
confiscate the assets of those suspected of buying and selling drugs. Gates 
said the vehicles will be used by undercover officers or will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to show drug dealers and anyone else who would destroy our 
neighborhood that they are not welcome," City Councilwoman Gloria Molina said 
at a news conference at the park with Gates and John Zenter, special agent in 
charge of the DEA's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
"We will wipe out their graffiti, dump their debris and take this community 
back," she said. "We will be totally intolerant of anyone involved in a 
criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police on Horseback 
</P>
<P>
Molina said that at her behest, the Police Department beefed up patrols, adding 
mounted police in the park area and deploying a special task force of 
undercover officers near the Magnolia Avenue Elementary School, an area 
frequented by drug dealers and their clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought a cleanup crew in," Gates said. "And we're going to bring in a 
maintenance crew of uniformed officers . . . to keep things clean. We're not 
going to come in and then just walk away."

FEARING LOSS OF JOB, WORKER ON SICK LEAVE WOUNDS 2, KILLS SELF 
</P>

A man who mistakenly believed he was going to be fired walked into his 
company's offices in Carson on Thursday and shot two officials before fatally 
wounding himself, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton Belschner, 37, of Chino Hills was in critical condition at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center with gunshot wounds to the neck and back. Gerald Quinlan, 50, of 
Torrance was in good condition after being treated for a shoulder wound, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. The assailant, Glenn Bantigue, 33, of 
Downey, was pronounced dead at Gardena Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Bantigue went to the Cosco Fire Protection Division of Zurn Industries at 321 
E. Gardena Blvd. about 2:30 p.m., armed with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
pistol, deputies said. He entered an office and fired several shots, wounding 
Belschner, the firm's controller, and assistant controller Quinlan before 
shooting himself in the head, Deputy Chris Wahla said. 
</P>
<P>
Belschner's secretary, who declined to give her name, said Bantigue entered the 
office and began to argue with her boss -- "something about an advertisement he 
saw for his job." 
</P>
<P>
Cosco employees told investigators the gunman, who had been out on disability, 
read a help-wanted ad in a local newspaper for his job and thought he was going 
to be fired. The advertisement apparently was placed to fill the vacancy 
created by Bantigue's absence, Wahla said. The company had no intention of 
firing Bantigue, who was to be transferred to another job, the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
In the controller's office, the gunman made repeated demands to know why the 
company was seeking a replacement, the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have to have a collector," was the reply, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belschner sent the woman out of the office to retrieve a file. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have been gone for more than a couple minutes, then all of a sudden 
there was shooting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bantigue had worked for Cosco since 1981 and had been on disability for the 
last 30 days after suffering an injury when he fell out of a chair, deputies 
said. He worked in the company's collection division, handling delinquent 
accounts for Cosco, which manufactures sprinkler systems for buildings.

COMMUTERS' CARS POSE CANCER PERIL, NEW STUDY WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commuters who travel the Los Angeles Basin's congested roadways are exposed in 
their cars to between two and four times the levels of cancer-causing toxic 
chemicals found outdoors, according to a new study to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
Added to this disturbing finding, the two-year study by researchers for the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District concluded that it makes little 
difference whether drivers roll their windows up in an effort to block fumes; 
commuters are only slightly better off with windows closed. And, perhaps 
surprising to some, the study found that motorists are better off with car 
vents open rather than closed. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, however, the study also concluded that motorists caught in 
traffic of less than 25 m.p.h. have greater exposure to toxic gases than when 
traffic is moving at more than 30 m.p.h., and that older vehicles -- those made 
from 1973 to 1983 -- allow "significantly higher" levels of carbon monoxide, 
benzene and toluene to seep in. 
</P>
<P>
"Even assuming a constant level of inspection and maintenance, older vehicles' 
emission controls and other parts continue to deteriorate, causing more 
emissions of exhaust pollutants" into the car and the atmosphere, the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers cautioned that higher exposures do not necessarily translate into 
equally heightened health risks. But there is general agreement that as 
exposures increase, so do health risks. 
</P>
<P>
The study, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to 
add new urgency to the AQMD's drive to tighten vehicle emission standards and 
step up ride-sharing efforts. The study, a copy of which was obtained by The 
Times, is to be released at an AQMD board meeting in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
The report called for stepped-up ride-sharing, traffic signal synchronization 
and staggered work hours -- all proposed in the AQMD's sweeping clean air 
blueprint approved by the district in March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measures Suggested 
</P>
<P>
"These measures, in combination with more stringent vehicle emission limits, 
can reduce exposures to air pollutants in vehicles as well as in other 
environments," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long recognized that outdoor exposures account for only a 
portion of an individual's total exposure to various pollutants. Over the last 
several years, researchers have found that concentrations of some toxic, 
cancer-causing and mutagenic pollutants found indoors, while still relatively 
low, are nonetheless often at least 10 times greater than outdoors and far 
exceed limits placed on the same pollutants in outdoor air by the federal Clean 
Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
While there have been previous studies dealing with carbon monoxide exposures 
in cars and hundreds of studies dealing with toxic pollutants in buildings, the 
AQMD research is believed to be one of the first "substantive" examinations of 
a wide range of air toxics found in cars, according to an AQMD source who asked 
to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Benzene, a known human carcinogen associated with leukemia, poses the greatest 
health risk to the Basin's commuters of all the 16 toxics studied, researchers 
said. They found benzene concentrations in cars were about four times higher 
than those outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that, among the Basin's total population, there is a one in 
10,000 chance of getting cancer from benzene exposure. Based on the study, 
researchers concluded that 15% of those cases -- or 15 out of a million -- 
would be due to exposure during commuting to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Risk 
</P>
<P>
But the total cancer risk from benzene exposures while driving is probably much 
higher than that, researchers said. They cautioned that their study looked only 
at exposures during round-trip commutes to work, which averaged 1 1/2 hours 
each weekday. The study did not survey trips to the store or other errands. 
</P>
<P>
"This risk from total in-vehicle exposure would be greater if all non-work 
commute trips were considered," the study warned. 
</P>
<P>
The study noted that others have estimated that each weekday there are 3.35 
million round trips from home to office, 13.5 million non-work round trips, and 
3.15 million one-way work related trips. 
</P>
<P>
Lead concentrations measured in vehicles were roughly 60% higher than outdoor 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 140 commuter cars were sampled for in-vehicle concentrations of 16 
air pollutants while commuting to and from work. The participants, who were 
randomly selected, lived throughout the four-county South Coast Air Basin, but 
all commute to Flair Business Park in South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monitoring Devices 
</P>
<P>
Special monitoring devices were installed in the cars and drivers kept a log of 
their mileage. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers called for support of the state Air Resource Board's proposal to 
limit benzene content of gasoline beginning in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The new limits would cut the cancer risks estimated in the study by 20%, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Benzene contributes the great risk to the Basin's commuters," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Ditas C. Shikiya, Chung S. Liu, Michael I. Kahn, 
Jesse Juarros and Wayne Barcikowski of the AQMD's Office of Planning and Rules. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 pollutants studied were: carbon monoxide; benzene; toluene; xylene; 
ethylene dibromide; ethylene dichloride; lead; formaldehyde; acetaldehyde; 
carbon tetrachloride; chloroform; perchloroethylene; 1,1,1-Trichloroethylene; 
cadmium; chromium and nickel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMUTERS AND TOXIC POLLUTANTS 
</P>
<P>
A new study by the South Coast Air Quality Management District shows that 
people driving in cars are exposed to higher concentrations of most toxic air 
contaminants than are found in generally in the Los Angeles Basin. Researchers 
placed special monitors inside vehicles and asked drivers to keep a log of 
their commuting habits. Gas levels are in parts per billion; metals levels are 
in micro-grams per cubic meter

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smoking will be banned in city-owned buildings and public areas of banks, 
restaurants and other establishments under a new law drafted by El Segundo 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Council members are expected to adopt the nonsmoking ordinance when they meet 
May 16. The law would go into effect 30 days later. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulations follow those advocated by Americans for Non-Smokers 
Rights, a nonprofit organization that lobbied council members to draft the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Besides prohibiting smoking in city buildings and public areas, the ordinance 
will require restaurants with more than 40 seats to create nonsmoking areas. 
Those with fewer than 40 seats will be required to post a sign telling 
customers whether smoking is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Also, employers must maintain nonsmoking areas in lounges and cafeterias and 
establish smoke-free areas for non-smokers "to the maximum extent possible." 
Employers will not be forced to create smoke-free areas if it requires them to 
incur any expenses.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCUBA DIVER'S BODY FOUND OFF CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's divers on Thursday found the body of a scuba diver in the waters off 
Santa Catalina Island near where he disappeared more than one week ago, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Alan Flores, 20, a Navy aviation machinist's mate and airman apprentice, 
was discovered about 10:30 a.m. off Long Point in 120 feet of water 100 yards 
from shore, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Detta Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who was from La Puente, was last seen April 23 while diving with 
friends, who lost sight of him in deep water about 200 yards from shore, 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores was on weekend leave from his base in San Diego when the accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Since his disappearance, sheriff's divers had searched the waters off Catalina, 
at one point using a sophisticated deep-water video camera on loan from Santa 
Barbara City College to scan waters as deep as 210 feet.

A 25-year-old man was arrested and charged in the murder of an elderly Rowland 
Heights woman who was found dead in her apartment last month, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Anthony Hardin was arrested Tuesday by Los Angeles County sheriff's 
homicide detectives and arraigned Thursday in Citrus Municipal Court, Deputy 
Hal Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin was charged in the murder of Norma Barber, 66, whose body was found 
April 8 by her son at her apartment at 1900 Fullerton Road in the 
unincorporated area of Rowland Heights, Grant said. She had been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin had worked as a security guard at the apartment complex. The district 
attorney's office will seek the death penalty in the case since the murder 
allegedly occurred while Hardin was robbing the apartment, Grant said.

NANCY REAGAN LEADS YOUNGSTERS IN PLEDGE AGAINST DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Led by Nancy Reagan, more than 20,000 schoolchildren from throughout Los 
Angeles County joined Thursday in a pledge to lead drug-free lives in a Just 
Say No to alcohol and drugs rally in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling her recent participation in a police raid on a rock cocaine house in 
South-Central Los Angeles, the former First Lady said she wished that the young 
people she had seen on that occasion could have been reached by someone earlier 
in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big, bright world out there waiting for you," Mrs. Reagan told the 
cheering students. "Each of you is a special person, and your life is too 
precious to lose to drugs. We only make this trip once, I think, so let's make 
it count." 
</P>
<P>
The rally, the fourth annual event sponsored by the Just Say No Foundation of 
Los Angeles County, ended with the singing of "We Are the World" and the 
release of thousands of green and white balloons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costumed Characters 
</P>
<P>
The program included costumed Flintstone characters; the U.S. Marine Band; 
McGruff, the Take a Bite Out of Crime Dog; drivers from the Mickey Thompson 
Off-Road Championship Gran Prix, and skits by Just Say No clubs. 
</P>
<P>
KABC-TV Sports Director Jim Hill was master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"Is cocaine a drug," McGruff asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," screamed the children. 
</P>
<P>
"Is alcohol a drug"? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," they chorused. 
</P>
<P>
"What should you say"? 
</P>
<P>
"No," the students shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Hill, the students delighted in crying "no" as loud as they 
could, while waving little, green Just Say No flags, cheering wildly and 
finally chanting, "Thank you, Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
To Bashiri Ferguson, 11, a fifth-grader from Harbor City, the message to say 
"no" was "great." But, Bashiri said he also liked "the cars jumping, the 
singing, the dancing." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it because it was so good," said Bobbie Gough, 12, a sixth-grader from 
Juniper Intermediate School in Palmdale. "When they let the balloons out, it 
was neat. She (Mrs. Reagan) was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Tongish, one of the Pasadena volunteers who helped Barbara Mouron, 
president of the county Just Say No Foundation, stage the rally, described the 
event as a "screaming success." Tongish said she hopes that the long-term 
effort, designed to support young people to remain drug free, will also be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investing in Future 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know until a generation away, but we're investing in the future," 
she said. "That's all we can do. All those kids standing there singing, 'We Are 
the World.' This is our future." 
</P>
<P>
Ivy Cohen, executive director of Just Say No International, headquartered in 
Walnut Creek, Calif., said that throughout the country there are about 15,000 
Just Say No clubs, with members ranging in age from 7 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
She announced that Mrs. Reagan has agreed to continue to serve as the group's 
honorary chairman.

Soul singer James Brown, celebrating his 56th birthday in prison Wednesday, was 
allowed to take a brief telephone call from Arsenio Hall, during which Hall 
wished him well and told him his fans missed him. Jesse Jackson made 
arrangements for the call during a visit to Brown, who is at the State Park 
Correctional Center in South Carolina. Hall played a tape of the 5-minute 
conversation on his TV show Thursday night. Brown is serving time for 
aggravated assault and failing to stop for police during a chase across the 
Georgia-South Carolina border Sept. 26. ALEENE MacMINN

The National Hispanic Media Coalition joined forces this week with the National 
Puerto Rican Forum to file negative comments against two New York TV stations 
that are up for federal license renewals. The coalition, a Los Angeles-based 
umbrella group, and the New York-based forum singled out WNET Channel 13, a PBS 
station, and WPIX Channel 11, a Tribune Broadcasting Co.-owned station, for 
their low Latino employment numbers, particularly in upper management ranks. 
Both groups said WNET was the worst offender, claiming that 6.4% of its overall 
work force and 3% of its top management posts were filled by Latinos. George L. 
Miles, WNET's executive vice president, defended the station's commitment to 
affirmative action at all levels and argued that WNET's programming "represents 
all minorities and is the finest anywhere." Coalition president Armando Duron 
responded that "public TV stations like WNET are under the impression that . . 
. because they offer better programming, it exempts them from certain legal 
requirements. We're here to tell them it doesn't." ALEENE MacMINN

AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: SILVA DANCES WITH DEXTERITY ALONG FINE LINE 
OF STYLE, ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LEWINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The difference between art and style can be difficult to discern these days. 
It's not so much that style has become arty -- style has always had its arty 
aspects -- but that art has become stylish: in its visual appearance, its 
standing in popular culture, and its relationship to money. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, from the mid-1970s back to Impressionism, new art wasn't 
welcomed beyond its small circle of creators and friends. It attracted no 
groupies and didn't sell well. Artists pretty much expected this. As a result, 
avant-garde art was in no way "stylish" in the sense that fashion and interior 
decoration are stylish. 
</P>
<P>
Today, though, most of the most seductive new visual forms appear in MTV videos 
and channel IDs; a lot of the art that sells like crazy in allegedly serious 
galleries looks an awful lot like the stuff on MTV. It's usually very clever, 
hot slick art; like the fashions advertised on the channel, it makes a lot of 
money for artist and dealer alike. But this is what one expects of style. One 
hopes for more from art. 
</P>
<P>
In Ernest Silva's most recent work, at the Dietrich Jenny Gallery, a 
marvelously dexterous dance is performed along what is the very thin line 
separating style and art. 
</P>
<P>
The show consists of several paintings and a greater number of sculptural 
assemblages, the latter being a form that has captured increasing amounts of 
the artist's energy during the past two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant characteristic of the new work is its blatant deviation 
from norms of what art should look like, i.e. paintings; it's here that 
concerns about stylishness arise. An early work of this type, "Errant Ship, 
Night Storm," of 1988, combines a skeletal canoe constructed of narrow wood 
slats with a bowler hat that hangs beneath the boat's lower end. Roughly 5 feet 
long, the assemblage hangs vertically against the wall, as though from a coat 
hook. The whole structure is painted in blued grays highlighted with rhythmic 
strokes of grayed blues and looks like a shadow come alive. 
</P>
<P>
In the more recent "Voyage Above the Volcano," reeds are used to form the 
framework of a cone representing an archetypal volcano. More reeds are used to 
suggest materials being belched out by the volcano. Tangled up in these is 
another boat shape. The whole assemblage is painted in alternating variations 
of orange tones and grays. Although not as expressively focused as "Errant Ship 
. . .," the work suggests that Silva's artmaking has by now become quite free 
of conventional painting and has begun exploring the open waters of available 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
He next turns to wire mesh, using it to produce three-dimensional shapes such 
as suitcases and cages. One of the suitcases holds within it a candle, a 
picture frame, a painter's palette, and a knife. 
</P>
<P>
In "House of the Poet," a picture frame with a crow perched on it dangles 
halfway out from the bottom of a cage shape. Even more elaborately, in 
"Self-Portrait," a painter's palette board covered in happy blues occupies a 
cage that has a corncob pipe sticking out of it. The cage sits atop another of 
the wood canoes and is painted red. This sits atop a dresser painted in bright 
yellows. A black necktie blotched with blue hangs from the bottom of the canoe 
and drapes over the dresser, and so a figure of sorts results; the elements 
wonderfully suggesting the operations and mindset of the artist. 
</P>
<P>
These works and the others like them in the show are so unlikely and lively 
that, at first, you might wonder if its merely stylishness, affection, an 
abandoning of the realm of ideas and insight which gives art its depth in favor 
of some visual razzmatazz. Fret not, however. Time spent with the work reveals 
that Silva is coyly toying with stylishness and exploiting its energy, but he 
never gives in to it. There's too much mood, too much personal revelation, too 
much intelligent formal exploration for that to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, consider the largest of the paintings in the show, "Rogue's Gallery," 
which was produced this year and which constitutes a kind of update on Silva's 
development as an artist. In the foreground, a nude female holding a candle and 
gazing seductively at the viewer stretches out on the floor. Behind her, on two 
walls forming the corner of a room, are two paintings. One shows a figure on a 
horse galloping over a fallen man in a ruined forest (a recurring motif in 
Silva's earlier paintings and cutouts). The other shows a portrait-like image 
of the fallen man wearing a hat, a patch over one eye, and smoking a corncob 
pipe. He looks dangerous. The imagery suggests Gauguin in its tropical feeling 
and expression. The formal handling suggests Matisse. 
</P>
<P>
This is art aware of itself and its traditions. It's tricky, tough, 
mischievous; also, varying from the standard. That's what "rogue" means. That's 
what art is.

EX-ATTY. GEN. EVELLE YOUNGER IS DEAD AT 70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FBI agent, judge, Los Angeles prosecutor, California attorney general and 
one-time Republican nominee for governor, Evelle J. Younger died quietly, and 
suddenly, Thursday in his Hollywood Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
His only child, Superior Court Judge Eric E. Younger, said he had lunched with 
the former attorney general on Wednesday and he was well. Around 8 a.m. 
Thursday, his wife, Mildred, summoned paramedics to the family residence above 
the Sunset Strip when Younger did not rise from his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
He died of heart disease, said Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob 
Dambacher. His family said he had not seen a doctor in two months. 
</P>
<P>
During nearly four decades as one of California's most durable law enforcement 
politicians, Younger tangled with some memorable characters, famous and 
infamous, of those turbulent times. 
</P>
<P>
He was Los Angeles County district attorney during the prosecutions of mass 
murderer Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan, assassin of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
He was the first prosecutor in America to undertake mass felony prosecutions of 
college campus demonstrators in the 1960s. As state attorney general, he ran 
for governor and lost to Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. He also pushed the 
landmark case that gave rise to the modern environmental impact statement on 
private developments. 
</P>
<P>
Among his political friends were Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and 
Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, campaign after campaign, office after office, Younger stood as 
rock-jawed testament to the fact that political success and survival in 
California are not always a matter of one's gifts for grandstands and fireworks 
or the sweep of one's ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Younger gave a good name to the reserved, down-to-business Midwestern style of 
political administration and steadfast moderation. 
</P>
<P>
"Evelle Younger served the people of California with great dedication and 
distinction," said former President Reagan on Thursday. "He was a loyal and 
trusted member of our (GOP) team. Nancy and I are deeply saddened by Evelle's 
passing and extend our sympathy and prayers to his family." 
</P>
<P>
Younger had been attorney general when Reagan was governor. 
</P>
<P>
Younger was known by subordinates and associates as "The General," befitting 
his position as attorney general, his rank as a reserve Air Force major 
general, and his general demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
A rival once called him as exciting as a "mashed potato sandwich," a remark 
that followed him for years. "I don't think I am dull," he responded in an 
interview later, "but I suppose I may not be the best judge of that. Whatever I 
am, the public has confidence in me. They obviously perceive me as an honest, 
competent and hard-working professional and that's just what I am." 
</P>
<P>
Younger lost only one election but it was his biggest, the 1978 campaign 
against incumbent Brown, who was then at the height of popularity. Younger 
never sought public office again. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Younger's career had been a methodical, 37-year advance up the law 
enforcement political ladder. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Nebraska with a law degree from Nebraska University, Younger became 
an FBI agent and served with military intelligence in the Burma campaign during 
World War II. He also served in the Korean conflict. 
</P>
<P>
He married in 1942 and shared with Mildred Younger a life-long bent for 
politics. The daughter of a politician, she was a candidate for the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Became a Judge 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Younger worked for a year as a Los Angeles deputy city attorney 
and as Pasadena city prosecutor. He was appointed a Municipal Court judge by 
then-Gov. Earl Warren. Next, he won election to the Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
His political profile rose substantially in 1964 when he was elected district 
attorney of Los Angeles County. He was reelected in 1968. During his tenure 
were the Watts riots of 1965, the assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in 
1968, the diabolical Manson cult murders of 1969, and the campus civil rights 
and anti-war upheavals of the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the most interesting jobs any lawyers had at the most interesting 
times," Younger once said reflectively. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, he became the first Republican in a generation to win the office of 
state attorney general. Younger campaigned as someone tough on crime but 
sympathetic to consumer and environmental interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I was particularly impressed with his respect and concern for the 
environment," said Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy. He called Younger a 
"respected moderate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Ruling 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Younger is remembered for pursuing the 1972 Mammoth Lake case. 
This resulted in the most important environmental ruling of that decade -- that 
public agencies cannot sanction new construction without first evaluating the 
environmental impact it will cause. 
</P>
<P>
Younger's environmental support dwindled later when he became a champion of 
nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
Another Democrat reacting to the death was John K. Van de Kamp, who succeeded 
Younger as both Los Angeles County district attorney and attorney general. He 
called Younger a "fine administrator and a fine man to work with over the 
years." 
</P>
<P>
As with most public men whose careers were as lengthy as his, Younger's was not 
without its share of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest political blunder occurred after he won the GOP gubernatorial 
nomination in June of 1978. He then went to Hawaii on vacation. This left Gov. 
Brown time to reverse course and become a champion of the historic Proposition 
13 tax cuts that were approved in that election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Four Pensions 
</P>
<P>
Younger was also widely ridiculed for receiving four pensions -- from the city 
and county of Los Angeles, the state and the military -- while still of working 
age. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the McCarthy era of the 1950s, it was a different and less moderate 
Younger who proclaimed: "With the Red sympathizers in working control of most, 
if not all, of the Democratic Party in California, the only thing for loyal 
American members of that party to do is join with Republicans to defeat this 
Communist menance." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, Younger showed little mercy in confronting campus unrest. He 
prosecuted 24 students on 1,730 felony charges when they took over two 
buildings at San Fernando Valley State College (now Cal State Northridge) and 
held administrators hostage. The students, most of them black, were protesting 
the absence of black studies programs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, after disclosures of the U.S. massacre of civilians in My Lai, 
Vietnam, Younger the military man warned of the "big lie technique" that was 
being used to confuse the public between the "good guys and bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
After his retirement from politics, Younger became a partner in a Los Angeles 
law firm and maintained a large, active circle of friends and an interest in 
public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements are pending but a memorial service has been scheduled 
Monday at 3 p.m. at All Saints-Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills.

SENATE OKS ASSAULT GUN BAN BUT IT HITS NEW SNAG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Under an 11th-hour agreement reached with Gov. George Deukmejian, the state 
Senate on Thursday voted final passage of legislation banning military-style 
assault weapons in California. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor, however, made it clear that he will not sign the bill 
by Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) until he also has 
on his desk a supplemental measure containing the newly struck compromise. 
</P>
<P>
And the supplemental bill is snagged in the Assembly where Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) on Thursday reiterated his concern that the compromise 
weakens proposed penalties for illegal possession of such popular assault 
rifles as the Uzi, AR-15 and AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
Conceivably, if the governor stands fast and the Assembly refuses to send him 
the second bill containing the compromise, California can wind up with no 
assault gun ban, despite an enormous effort to enact one. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the Roberti bill was endorsed Thursday morning by Deukmejian, 
Roberti and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), author of the Assembly bill 
that would carry the compromise provision, two weeks after the governor 
unexpectedly held up final passage of the Senate bill and asked for time to 
study it and offer Weaamendments. After the agreement was reached, the Roberti 
bill was sent to the governor on a bipartisan 29-8 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the Roberti and Roos bills, which have drawn national attention, 
outlaw the importation, manufacture, sale and transfer of about 60 
military-style semiautomatic assault rifles, pistols and shotguns, effective 
next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
For owners of such guns who want to keep them, a registration system is 
established. Any assault arm legally obtained by June 1 can be registered with 
the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian had objected primarily to a provision of the legislation that makes 
it either a misdemeanor or a felony to fail to register a previously purchased 
assault gun by Jan. 1, 1991. He said such a penalty is "too severe" to impose 
on an otherwise law-abiding gun owner. And he pressed for making it a minor 
infraction subject to a fine, much like the penalty for a traffic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative and gubernatorial staff members negotiated a compromise that the 
governor agreed to in a phone call to Roberti. Under the compromise, a 
first-time offender who fails to register will be charged with a "major 
infraction" and fined at least $350 if the owner is arrested at a site where 
possession of a registered gun is legal. These locations include the owner's 
home, business or at an approved firing range. 
</P>
<P>
A second offense under the same circumstances will be subject to punishment as 
a misdemeanor or felony. It will be a felony to have an unregistered assault 
weapon anywhere else, such as on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voices Objection 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also had voiced objection to provisions of the legislation aimed at 
also restricting facsimiles of the assault weapons. He wanted the weapons to be 
restricted specifically listed in the bill. But law enforcement officers said 
there are possibly hundreds of such guns under many different brands and to 
list them all would be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, a Superior Court judge can add copycat guns to the banned 
list if the state attorney general can prove that they are assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, a long-time opponent of imposing new controls on guns, but who in 
January denounced assault weapons, declared himself "pleased" with the 
agreement and said it provides clarity and "more certainty." 
</P>
<P>
"The compromise, I think, is reasonable," Roberti told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the "astounding" opposition of the National Rifle Assn. and other gun 
owner groups, Roberti called on the Senate to demonstrate that "we can overcome 
the special interests and do what the public demands." 
</P>
<P>
"Only an aroused public demanding that the Legislature protect the public 
safety has put us in the position of being able to pass a bill and get it on 
the governor's desk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dash of Sweetness 
</P>
<P>
For Roberti, sending the bill to Deukmejian provided an extra dash of sweetness 
to his 50th birthday celebration. Shortly before passage, Roberti was serenaded 
by a mariachi band in the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Assembly, Brown cast gloom over the compromise reached with 
Deukmejian by Roberti and Roos, one of his top lieutenants. The Speaker 
reiterated his opposition, first voiced Tuesday, to "anything that weakens the 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he intends to thoroughly study the measure to determine if his fears 
are well founded, and told reporters he sees no need to hurry a bill to 
Deukmejian. He added that since Deukmejian sought the changes worked out with 
Roos and Roberti, "the governor ought to make the case with the public for 
acceptance of these changes." 
</P>
<P>
A usually cheerful Roos, now glum as he listened to Brown, insisted that the 
compromise reached with Deukmejian "is not a weakening of the bill." But Roos 
acknowledged that he faced a hard-sell when he spelled out details of the 
compromise to fellow Assembly Democrats during a private meeting on Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Roos told reporters he must start from "Square No. 1" and "re-educate" and 
persuade Assembly backers of the bill to continue supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
A Deukmejian spokesman, Tom Beerman, said it is "the governor's position that 
the legislation has not been weakened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Votes to Spare 
</P>
<P>
Although both the Roos and Roberti bills passed the Assembly earlier, it was 
with no votes to spare. The Assembly is considered especially sensitive to NRA 
lobbying and only two Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the Roos and 
Roberti bills. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the bills earlier had rated Assembly approval of the measures at 
only 50-50. No one improved the odds Thursday on the chances that Roos' bill 
containing the compromise will fare any better with Brown voicing concerns 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has said he wants both the main Roberti bill and the supplemental 
Roos measure containing the compromise on his desk before he signs either one. 
If he were to sign the Roberti bill, there would be no guarantee that the Roos 
bill would reach him. Thus, he would have signed into law a bill he did not 
entirely endorse. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has 12 days to sign the Roberti bill after it officially reaches 
him. However, he and the two legislative authors agreed that if the Assembly 
does not send him the compromise within the 12 days, the Senate can recall the 
Roberti bill. 
</P>
<P>
This would stop the clock and provide additional time for the Assembly to pass 
the supplemental bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be interesting to see what kind of deals are going to be cut 
now to get the damned bill out of the Assembly," said one senior Senate aide. 
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles-area neighborhood groups strongly backing the assault gun 
ban issued a statement calling on Brown "not to block this historic piece of 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
"Speaker Brown, the people of California will never understand taking defeat 
out of the jaws of victory," said the statement by the United Neighborhoods 
Organization, East Valley Organization, South Central Organizing Committee and 
Valleys Organized in Community Effort. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the roll call by which the Senate sent to the governor the Roberti 
assault gun ban bill: 
</P>
<P>
Democrats for (23) -- Alquist, Ayala, Boatwright, Deddeh, Dills, Garamendi, C.

ONLY 5 MINUTES LEFT, ATLANTIS LIFTS INTO ORBIT 
</P>

<P>
With only five minutes left in its 64-minute launch "window," the space shuttle 
Atlantis roared into orbit on a cloud of flame and smoke at 11:47 a.m. PDT 
Thursday, launching the United States into a new era of planetary exploration 
after an 11-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
A little over six hours after launch, at 6:01 p.m., Atlantis carried out its 
prime objective when mission specialist Mark C. Lee triggered a spring-loaded 
platform that sent the $325-million Magellan spacecraft spinning from the 
orbiter's 60-foot-long payload bay. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly an hour later, after Atlantis had moved a safe distance away from it, 
the first of Magellan's two solid rocket motors ignited, launching the craft on 
its 15-month, 800-million-mile voyage to Venus, where it will use radar to map 
the surface of Earth's sister planet. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is the first interplanetary probe launched by the United States since 
1978, and the first ever launched by the shuttle. With it, NASA is entering an 
unprecedented period of scientific activity that will include the launch of the 
Galileo probe to Jupiter in October and the orbiting of the Hubble Space 
Telescope in December. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is ever going to question our leadership in planetary science again," 
said Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, the astronauts had expressed delight with their 
perfect, if delayed, launch. "Four of us are happy to be back in space, and the 
fifth is happy to be here," radioed commander David M. Walker shortly after 
Atlantis entered its 160-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a cliffhanger," said acting NASA administrator Dale D. Myers, 
referring to the cloud cover at Kennedy's main runway, where Atlantis would 
have landed if the launch were aborted. 
</P>
<P>
Cloud cover at the site forced a 59-minute delay in the launch, almost causing 
the mission to be scrubbed for the second time in six days. An attempted launch 
last Friday was halted 31 seconds before liftoff when a cooling pump on one of 
the shuttle's engines failed. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's weather was a sharp contrast to last Friday's perfect conditions. A 
light rain soaked Atlantis on pad 39B for an hour shortly after dawn, and thick 
clouds threatened rain for most of the day. Air Force meteorologist Capt. 
Thomas Strange noted that "all of the clouds on the (Florida) peninsula" seemed 
to be right over Cape Canaveral and Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
But a brisk breeze from the ocean blew most of the clouds westward at the last 
minute, and chief astronaut Dan Brandenstein, flying over the Kennedy landing 
strip, finally reported that the skies were clear enough for an emergency 
landing if one proved necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the weather, the countdown went virtually flawlessly, and launch 
director Robert B. Sieck called it "exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
"Did somebody win the pool up there?" mission control commentator John 
Creighton asked the crew. "We had only five minutes left in the window." 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't want to push it any closer," replied Walker. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth shuttle launch since the space program was jarred by the 
January, 1986, destruction of Challenger and the 60th manned launch in the U.S. 
space program. Four more shuttle launches are scheduled for this year, 
including the first post-Challenger flight of Columbia, which is still in the 
process of being refitted with changes mandated after the Challenger accident. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan, designed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and assembled by 
Martin-Marietta Corp., will not reach Venus until Aug 10, 1990, when its 
braking rocket will shift it into a 3-hour, 9-minute elliptical orbit. For 37.2 
minutes of each orbit, a sophisticated radar system built by Hughes Aircraft 
Co. will map an 18-mile-wide swath of the planet's surface. It will then use 
the rest of the orbit to radio the data back to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In the 243-day primary phase of the mission, Magellan will map 80% of Venus's 
surface, sending back more data than all previous planetary probes combined. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope the data will allow them to understand the motion of tectonic 
plates on Venus, shedding new light on the causes of earthquakes on Earth, 
where tectonic motion is obscured by erosion and weathering. 
</P>
<P>
They also hope to learn more about the conditions that caused a so-called 
runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, which raised its surface temperature to 
nearly 900 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the crew are pilot Ronald J. Grabe and mission specialists 
Mary L. Cleave and Norman E. Thagard. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base at 12:44 p.m. PDT 
Monday.

BUSH DENIES RECIPROCAL ROLE WITH HONDURAS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, challenging evidence presented in the trial of former Lt. Col. 
Oliver L. North, denied Thursday that he took part in any Ronald Reagan 
Administration effort in 1985 to offer U.S. aid to Honduras in direct exchange 
for that country's assistance to Nicaragua's Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"The word of the President of the United States, George Bush, is there was no 
quid pro quo," the President declared in his first public response to evidence 
presented at the North trial. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been much needless, mindless speculation about my word of honor -- 
and I've answered it, now, definitively," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bush not only denied that he personally discussed a quid pro quo with 
then-Honduran President Roberto Suazo Cordova when they met in Honduras in 
1985, but he said that there was no such agreement between the two governments 
"as far as I know, to my knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
So sweeping and categorical was Bush's denial that it appeared likely to 
escalate the controversy over his alleged involvement in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Among the documents presented at the North trial was a 1985 memo signed by 
then-President Reagan approving the quid pro quo. A subsequent memo discussing 
the reciprocal deal carried a hand-written notation by John M. Poindexter, then 
Reagan's national security adviser, saying that "we want VP (Bush) to also 
discuss this matter with Suazo." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to reconcile those documents with the President's statement," 
said Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), former chairman of the House Iran-Contra 
investigating committee. 
</P>
<P>
Since the memos were made public during the North trial, Bush has been dogged 
by questions about whether he complied with Poindexter's wishes when he 
traveled to Honduras later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp questions also have been asked in Congress about why the Reagan 
Administration failed to provide these documents to the investigating 
committees. Until Thursday, Bush had refused to answer any questions on grounds 
that his response might affect the North trial. 
</P>
<P>
But once it was learned that the North jury had reached a verdict, Bush 
appeared eager to answer, discussing the matter with reporters while bidding 
goodby to Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at the diplomatic entrance of 
the White House. In fact, he made his statement a few minutes before the North 
verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Bush denied that the subject of a quid pro quo was mentioned at 
his meeting with Suazo. "The records of that meeting demonstrate that there was 
no quid pro quo," he said. ". . . No implication, no quid pro quo, direct or 
indirect, from me to the President of Honduras on that visit." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is no independent evidence that Bush brought up the quid pro quo 
at the meeting, even though Poindexter clearly wanted the vice president to do 
so. Then-U.S. Ambassador to Honduras John D. Negroponte, who attended the 
meeting, has said that no such deal was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
But the President did not confine his remarks to the meeting and members of 
Congress seemed most surprised by his statement that he had no knowledge of a 
quid pro quo. Not only do the memos suggest that Bush was informed of Reagan's 
decision to press for such a deal but congressional investigators long have 
assumed that such an arrangement existed, since Honduras received expedited 
economic aid from the United States in 1985 after agreeing to continue 
assisting the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, after Congress cut off direct U.S. aid to the Contras, Honduran 
officials made no secret of their desire for more economic aid from Washington 
in exchange for the risk they were taking by providing sanctuary to the Contras 
along their common border with Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
A top investigator for the Iran-Contra committees, who declined to be 
identified by name, suggested that Bush's categorical denial was based on a 
narrow definition of what constitutes a quid pro quo between two countries. He 
suggested that Bush may be defining U.S. aid to Honduras as an "incentive" 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Often Draws Distinction 
</P>
<P>
"One person's quid pro quo is another person's normal diplomacy," he noted. 
"The government has often drawn a distinction between 'incentives' and quid pro 
quos." 
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are currently investigating 
why the congressional Iran-Contra panels never received many of the documents 
pertaining to the Honduran deal. Bush pledged to cooperate with this inquiry 
"in every way requested." 
</P>
<P>
The President said that he already had told the congressional investigators to 
contact A.B. Culvahouse, who was Reagan's White House counsel during the 1987 
Iran-Contra investigation, and added: "Hopefully, they can resolve it between 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to insist that the congressional committees . . . be briefed fully 
on the confidential cables that bring up every fact of that meeting," Bush 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that Congress has a responsibility to pursue an explanation 
because the lesson of the Iran-Contra scandal is that the White House cannot be 
trusted to volunteer the full truth.

radioed commander David M. Walker shortly after Atlantis entered its 
185-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a cliffhanger," said acting NASA administrator Dale D. Myers, 
referring to the cloud cover at Kennedy's main runway, where Atlantis would 
have landed if the launch were aborted. 
</P>
<P>
Cloud cover at the site forced a 59-minute delay in the launch, almost causing 
the mission to be scrubbed for the second time in six days. An attempted launch 
last Friday was halted 31 seconds before liftoff when a cooling pump on one of 
the shuttle's engines failed. 
</P>
<P>
A little over six hours after launch, Atlantis was scheduled to carry out its 
prime objective, when mission specialist Mark C. Lee would release the 
$325-million Magellan spacecraft from the orbiter's 60-foot-long payload bay. 
An hour later, Magellan's solid rocket motor was to ignite, launching the craft 
on its 15-month, 800-million-mile voyage to Venus, where it will use radar to 
map the surface of Earth's sister planet. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan will be the first interplanetary probe launched by the United States 
since 1978, and the first ever launched by the shuttle. With it, NASA is 
entering an unprecedented period of scientific activity that will include the 
launch of the Galileo probe to Jupiter in October and the orbiting of the 
Hubble Space Telescope in December. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is ever going to question our leadership in planetary science again," 
said Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Contrast 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's weather was a sharp contrast to last Friday's perfect conditions. A 
light rain soaked Atlantis on pad 39B for an hour shortly after dawn, and thick 
clouds threatened rain for most of the day. Air Force meteorologist Capt. 
Thomas Strange noted that "all of the clouds on the (Florida) peninsula" seemed 
to be right over Cape Canaveral and Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
But a brisk breeze from the ocean blew most of the clouds westward at the last 
minute, and chief astronaut Dan Brandenstein, flying over the Kennedy landing 
strip, finally reported that the skies were clear enough for an emergency 
landing if one proved necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the weather, the countdown went virtually flawlessly, and launch 
director Robert B. Sieck called it "exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
"Did somebody win the pool up there?" mission control commentator John 
Creighton asked the crew. "We had only five minutes left in the window." 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't want to push it any closer," replied Walker. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth shuttle launch since the space program was jarred by the 
January, 1986, destruction of Challenger and the 60th manned launch in the U.S. 
space program. Four more shuttle launches are scheduled for this year, 
including the first post-Challenger flight of Columbia, which is still in the 
process of being refitted with changes mandated after the Challenger accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Venus Orbit 
</P>
<P>
Magellan, designed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and assembled by 
Martin-Marietta Corp., will not reach Venus until Aug 10, 1990, when its 
braking rocket will shift it into a 3-hour, 9-minute elliptical orbit. For 37.2 
minutes of each orbit, a sophisticated radar system built by Hughes Aircraft 
Co. will map an 18-mile-wide swath of the planet's surface. It will then use 
the rest of the orbit to radio the data back to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In the 243-day primary phase of the mission, Magellan will map 80% of Venus's 
surface, sending back more data than all previous planetary probes combined. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope the data will allow them to understand the motion of tectonic 
plates on Venus, shedding new light on the causes of earthquakes on Earth, 
where tectonic motion is obscured by erosion and weathering. 
</P>
<P>
They also hope to learn more about the conditions that caused a so-called 
runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, which raised its surface temperature to 
nearly 900 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the crew are pilot Ronald J. Grabe and mission specialists 
Mary L. Cleave and Norman E. Thagard. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base at 12:44 p.m. PDT 
Monday.

36 CAR THEFT SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three dozen suspected car thieves were arrested early Thursday by Riverside 
police and the California Highway Patrol after a yearlong sting operation in 
which undercover agents bought stolen cars for a fraction of their retail 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspects were from Riverside, San Bernardino and Los Angeles 
counties, CHP spokesman Mark Mezzano said. Another 27 suspects are being 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
The special auto theft task force -- set up to combat the theft of 250 cars a 
month in and around the city of Riverside -- recovered 165 stolen vehicles by 
buying them back from the thieves, Mezzano said. Thursday morning's raids were 
conducted by 75 officers from both agencies. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the stolen cars were used models, some were new and had been 
stolen from sales lots. Mezzano said a 1989 Mercedes worth $80,000 was sold to 
the undercover agents for $1,500. Some of the thieves returned time and again 
to unload their cars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The undercover agents opened the "storefront" operation in downtown Riverside a 
year ago and depended on word-of-mouth advertising among the thieves, Mezzano 
said. The thieves were interested in a quick turnover, he added, explaining, 
"We were paying $100 or $250 a car for most of them, take it or leave it." 
</P>
<P>
The sting operation was funded by a special $90,000 grant from the California 
Office of Criminal Justice Planning and $9,000 from the city of Riverside. The 
operation was finally closed out and the arrests made when the sting ran out of 
money, Mezzano said.

REPUTED DRUG RING KINGPIN ARRAIGNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reputed billionaire narcotics trafficker Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a key 
suspect in the murder of federal drug agent Enrique Camarena, was arraigned 
Thursday in Los Angeles on narcotics charges but refused to enter a plea, 
claiming that he had been kidnaped and tortured by U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, sources close to the investigation of the 1985 murder of 
Camarena told The Times that authorities have found one of Matta's hairs at the 
Guadalajara home of a Mexican drug lord where Camarena is believed to have been 
tortured and killed. 
</P>
<P>
Matta, whose arrest in Honduras set off widespread anti-American rioting last 
year outside the U.S. Embassy in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, alleged 
Thursday that he was taken into custody there by U.S. marshals, interrogated 
for nearly 24 hours and tortured repeatedly with a stun gun. 
</P>
<P>
"We are declining to plea because we are saying they have absolutely no right 
to have him here," Matta's attorney, Martin Stolar, told a federal magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assets Estimated 
</P>
<P>
Two federal indictments in Los Angeles charge Matta, 44, with directing a 
multimillion-dollar narcotics-trafficking organization headquartered in Cali, 
Colombia, that moved thousands of kilograms of cocaine up through Mexico and 
into Arizona and Southern California. Though he claims assets of $5 million, 
Matta's holdings are estimated by federal officials at $1 billion to $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Matta, a wealthy Honduran businessman who reportedly was that country's 
largest single employer before his arrest, has denied any connection to the 
cocaine-trafficking operation or to the death of Camarena, an agent with the 
federal Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But sources close to the Camarena investigation said the Matta hair sample 
found at the Camarena murder site was matched with hair taken from Matta in his 
cell at a federal prison in Marion, Ill., the nation's highest security federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
The sources acknowledge that the discovery of Matta's hair at the agent's 
murder site does not prove that he was at the house the day Camarena and his 
pilot were killed. But similar evidence was used to help convict suspected 
drug-trafficker Rene Verdugo Urquidez, who was tried for the DEA agent's 
murder, along with two other men in Los Angeles last year. 
</P>
<P>
Matta arrived Thursday afternoon at the Los Angeles Federal Courthouse for 
arraignment on two drug indictments under extraordinarily high security. 
Spectators were required to pass through a metal detector and show 
identification before entering the courtroom. Armed guards stood in the 
stairwells and other areas of the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities had attempted for years to extradite Matta, using earlier 
indictments in San Diego and Phoenix and a since-dismissed criminal complaint 
in New York. But they were hampered by a provision of the Honduran constitution 
that prohibits extradition of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on April 5, 1988, according to official news accounts, 160 police 
officers in helicopters swooped down at dawn on Matta's house in Tegucigalpa, 
apprehended him and put him aboard a flight to the Dominican Republic. Joined 
by U.S. marshals there, Matta was flown to Puerto Rico and then to New York. 
</P>
<P>
For days after, the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa was surrounded by an 
anti-American mob. 
</P>
<P>
But Stolar, Matta's attorney, said his client claims he was taken into custody 
by U.S. authorities, not Honduran officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat him, they tortured him, they interrogated him for 24 hours," Stolar 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Matta was so badly injured by the stun guns wielded by the marshals that prison 
officials in Marion photographed him when he arrived there, Stolar said. 
</P>
<P>
"They did not want to be blamed for the man's condition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stolar said he has given the photographs to a judge in Pensacola, Fla., where 
Matta once was sentenced for three years to a federal prison for illegally 
entering the United States with a false passport. Matta escaped from that 
prison, but since his recapture, he is finishing out that sentence in Marion. 
</P>
<P>
Stolar said Matta is refusing to enter a plea to the Los Angeles indictments 
because he contends that the circumstances of his arrest violated his 
constitutional rights of due process. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to give any sense of accepting the court's jurisdiction, given 
the violations of the U.S. Constitution," Stolar said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors declined to comment on Stolar's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"While Stolar might have the preference of litigating his case before the 
press, I would think the more proper forum would be in open court," Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Jimmy Gurule said. "At the appropriate time, I'm sure that issue 
will be raised, and it will be dealt with, and we're confident that it will not 
be a bar to moving forward with the case." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Matta's refusal, U.S. District Judge William J. Rea entered a not 
guilty plea on his behalf. 
</P>

HOUSE, SENATE PASS SIMILAR $1.2-TRILLION SPENDING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two houses of Congress approved separate $1.2-trillion spending plans 
Thursday designed to carry out the budget accord struck with the White House 
and hold the deficit below $100 billion for fiscal 1990, which begins next Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the House and Senate resolutions are similar, the budget measure will 
have to go to a House-Senate conference committee to iron out some differences. 
The balloting in the House was 263 to 157. Approval in the Senate came on a 
vote of 68 to 31. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in the legislation were held to a minimum, reflecting a reluctance by 
lawmakers to risk upsetting the budget agreement with the White House. A 
Democratic move to impose an oil import fee to help finance higher spending for 
social programs was roundly defeated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approves Wilson Amendment 
</P>
<P>
In the only two notable revisions, the Senate approved an amendment by Sen. 
Pete Wilson (D-Calif.) to boost spending for drug enforcement by $100 million, 
while the House increased veterans' programs by $175 million. In both cases, 
the money was offset by cuts elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the final vote, House members rejected a bid by Rep. Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) that would have raised an additional $9 billion in revenues by 
imposing an oil import fee. Gephardt also would have hiked domestic spending by 
$5.8 billion. The vote against it was 373 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
And the Senate brushed aside a substitute proposal by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings 
(D-S.C.) that would have frozen all government spending at the current year's 
levels. The vote on that measure was 82 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the two budget resolutions were passed virtually intact suggests 
that the accord the lawmakers worked out with Administration officials most 
likely will stand -- at least long enough to meet the deficit targets mandated 
by the Gramm-Rudman budget law. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration already has announced that it hopes to complete negotiations 
with Congress this year on a budget accord for fiscal 1991 -- a virtually 
unprecedented development, if it ultimately occurs. Talks on the fiscal 1991 
budget could begin early next month. That fiscal year begins Oct. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman of the House Budget 
Committee, said that the House-Senate conference committee will start work next 
week in hopes of completing the measure so the congressional appropriations 
process can begin on schedule May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that the compromise budget package was modest because of the 
constraints imposed by President Bush's refusal to consider new tax increases, 
Panetta promised that the lawmakers would consider a "bolder" plan for fiscal 
1991 -- but only if Bush agreed to drop his restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"If the President continues to say, 'read my lips (no new taxes),' you're not 
likely to see a bold package," the Budget Committee chairman told reporters. 
White House officials have consistently refused to say what Bush will do for 
fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of mostly technical reasons, the two resolutions call for 
slightly different deficit levels. The Senate version projects a red-ink figure 
of $99.4 billion, while the House resolution assumes a deficit of about $99.7 
billion. The two will be reconciled in conference. 
</P>
<P>
As was the accord with the White House, the two congressional resolutions were 
based on forecasts of the economy's performance that many outside economists 
regard as overly optimistic. Both assume a slight reduction in interest rates, 
which have been on the increase. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also have yet to work out details of how they will raise some 
$5.3 billion in added tax revenues called for as part of the accord, without 
violating President Bush's campaign pledge for no new taxes. They also left 
vague their plans for getting $5.7 billion from sales of U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
As specified in the accord with the White House, the two budget resolutions 
essentially would freeze outlays for military programs at their current level 
of about $299 billion, while allowing spending for domestic programs to keep 
pace with inflation.

ISRAEL TO PUNISH 11 IN BLOODY RAID ON ARAB TOWN

<P>
The Israeli military announced Thursday that an inquiry has decided on 
disciplinary action against four army officers and seven border police officers 
for misconduct during a raid on the West Bank town of Nahalin in which five 
Palestinians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, approved by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, came from three weeks 
of interrogation of border police, soldiers and village residents who witnessed 
the April 13 incident. Their publication was designed as a response to 
widespread questions about the clash, one of the most violent of the 
17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators, headed by an unidentified brigadier general, found that the 
seven border police officers "lost control" and violated army regulations by 
opening fire with live ammunition against rock-throwing youths without first 
trying to meet the situation with rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Firing All Over the Place' 
</P>
<P>
"They were firing all over the place," said Col. Raanan Gissin, the army's 
foreign press spokesman who presented the panel's conclusions at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Gissin would not say exactly what the seven did, citing a separate 
investigation by the border police to determine further disciplinary action 
that he said could include criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The seven officers cited for misconduct will be assigned outside Gaza or the 
West Bank pending the outcome of that investigation, the report said. The 
captain in command inside the village, the major who commanded the company and 
the lieutenant colonel in command of the district also will be removed from 
commands in the occupied territories but face no further disciplinary action, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the colonel commanding the Israeli army brigade in the Judea 
district of the West Bank will receive a reprimand, the report added. 
</P>
<P>
Gissin said a border police unit of about 25 men entered the village at 5 a.m. 
After meeting stone throwers on the outskirts, he said, the troops drove the 
attackers back with tear gas and rubber bullets without casualties. 
</P>
<P>
A second unit entered about half an hour later from another road, he added. It 
came under attack from more stone throwers and responded with live ammunition 
immediately, causing all the casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an opposition member of Parliament said Israeli troops in the West 
Bank had broken the arms and legs of bound Palestinian prisoners and left them 
lying in an orchard. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the Haaretz newspaper Thursday, Yossi Sarid quoted unnamed officers 
as saying they were ordered by a lieutenant colonel to arrest 12 Arabs in the 
village of Hawwara and break their limbs. The officers told Sarid they entered 
the village with 40 soldiers one night in January, 1988, arrested the men -- 
who they said offered no resistance -- and took them bound hand and foot to a 
nearby orchard, where the beatings took place.

CHINESE STUDENTS IN U.S. BACK PROTESTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese students in the United States have written an open letter to their 
government expressing strong support for the pro-democracy student 
demonstrations in China. 
</P>
<P>
The message was read by telephone Tuesday to students at Beijing University who 
tape-recorded it for dissemination in China, Guyang Huang, a University of 
Massachusetts graduate student, said Thursday in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the University of Massachusetts wrote the five-paragraph document 
last Saturday and placed it on the two-year-old computer network that allows 
Chinese studying in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan to 
communicate about events in China. Some of the 230 Chinese students at UC San 
Diego, one of the largest such communities at an American university, took part 
in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"All over the world from the east to the west, democracy has become an 
irresistible historical trend. . . . How about China?" part of the statement 
reads. 
</P>
<P>
"Please let the people speak and know the truth . . . . We appeal for a 
dialogue between the (Communist) Party and the people and students to answer 
people's questions instead of suppressing them. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Huang said Thursday that overseas scholars have raised $15,000 from among their 
peers in the United States, Canada, West Germany and Norway to help in 
disseminating the letter to students throughout China. 
</P>
<P>
The Voice of America said Thursday that it has received calls from Chinese 
students at 30 American universities asking that the letter be broadcast. The 
VOA has requested a copy and its East Asian division chief will decide, based 
on its newsworthiness, whether to put it on the air, a VOA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
There is strong support for the demonstrations among the approximately 20,000 
Chinese students in the United States, according to students at several 
universities. All are anxiously awaiting the Chinese government's response to 
the three weeks of demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese people now want a real government system, not just a good king like 
Deng Xiaoping (China's paramount leader) was," Dan Hu, a graduate student in 
electrical engineering at UC San Diego, said. 
</P>
<P>
Said colleague Li Sen, who is working for a doctorate in biochemistry: "I think 
the concerns of Chinese students have changed, and we are now as concerned 
about the political future as well as the economic future." 
</P>
<P>
Chai Xiaoyong, a University of Chicago graduate student in sociology, used the 
computer network last week to help organize a demonstration by students at 11 
Midwestern universities in front of the Chinese Consulate in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"All students abroad have the same feeling, the responsibility to do whatever 
we can to support those back in our country . . . to give them courage and a 
loyal boost," Chai said. 
</P>
<P>
The great number of Chinese students who have received degrees abroad since 
1980 -- an estimated 30,000 from the United States alone -- is contributing to 
the demands for more openness, several UC San Diego students said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a large indirect influence, and because of our country's more 
open policy on travel, and so forth, we are much more able to make 
comparisons," said mathematics graduate student He Zhengxu, who has accepted an 
assistant professorship at Princeton next year rather than return to China.

BLANTYRE, Malawi 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arriving in Malawi, whose economic self-sufficiency has been all but destroyed 
by a heavy influx of refugees from Mozambique, Pope John Paul II paid tribute 
Thursday to the remarkable selflessness of the people of this African country. 
</P>
<P>
"The international community applauds your generosity," the Pope said on the 
final stop of a nine-day visit to southern Africa. He will leave Saturday for 
Rome, having visited -- in addition to Malawi -- Madagascar, the French island 
of Reunion and Zambia since beginning the tour April 28. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff was greeted at Blantyre airport by perhaps the most distinctive 
head of state he has encountered on this trip, H. Kamuzu Banda, the 
nonagenarian "president for life" of Malawi. 
</P>
<P>
Banda wasted no time in lecturing the Pope about his own accomplishments in 
leading this landlocked, resource-poor nation of 7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you've heard and read in the newspapers that Malawi has a very good 
name, especially in Europe, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, the United 
States. . . ." He reeled off the name of virtually every major nation in his 
surprisingly firm baritone. 
</P>
<P>
"You've heard and read that Malawi is one of the best-governed countries in 
Africa," he added, in what might apply more to the impeccable tidiness of 
Malawi's streets, the orderliness of its crowds and the precise orchestration 
of its presidential rallies than to its rock-bottom per capita spending on 
education and health, its declining literacy rate and its level of political 
repression. 
</P>
<P>
Banda has also lent his people something of his own religious background -- a 
Calvinist Presbyterianism that places them among Africa's most abstemious 
people. Although the country is a major exporter of tobacco, cigarette smokers 
are rare here. "Why consume what we can export for money?" a businessman 
remarked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catholics and Protestants 
</P>
<P>
About 25% of the population is Catholic and a third is Protestant, including 
members of some Presbyterian splinter sects found nowhere but in Scotland and 
Malawi. 
</P>
<P>
The welcoming ceremony was more notable for what went unsaid than for what was 
said. Absent from the pontiff's and president's remarks was any reference to 
apartheid, the racist policy of South Africa that was the subtext at almost 
every gathering on the Pope's previous stop, in Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
This was not surprising, for two African leaders could scarcely differ more in 
their approach to South Africa than do Banda and Zambia's President Kenneth D. 
Kaunda. 
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, perhaps Africa's most obdurate foe of South Africa, maintains full 
diplomatic relations with the anti-apartheid African National Congress, and 
Banda's Malawi is the only sub-Saharan country that maintains full diplomatic 
relations with Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Banda has long held that normal relations are necessary because of the economic 
dependence of most southern African countries on South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the Pope's focus on Malawi's service to the Mozambicans was 
entirely appropriate. Malawi had been producing enough corn and other staples 
to feed itself before the vicious Mozambican guerrilla war began forcing 
refugees across the border three years ago. Today there are more than 600,000 
Mozambicans in Malawi, many of them occupying otherwise cultivable land. 
</P>
<P>
Now Malawi is an importer of food. The huge refugee population has denuded its 
forests in quest of firewood, leading to severe flooding in districts that had 
not been so inundated in more than 30 years. In the south, where the greatest 
concentrations of Mozambicans are found, roads crucial to the transport of farm 
goods have been shattered by the passage of heavy trucks carrying relief 
supplies.

FRAUD SEEN AS KEY TO ELECTION;

PANAMA POLLS 'LOSER' LIKELY TO BE PRESIDENT

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There seems little doubt about the outcome of Sunday's national elections. 
Carlos Duque will suffer a crushing defeat, according to nearly all public 
opinion polls, yet he will go on to be declared Panama's next president. 
</P>
<P>
If it seems odd that a man who is trailing by at least a 2-1 margin in the 
polls just three days before the vote -- and is counted out by nearly all 
independent experts -- should be the overwhelming favorite to win, "you need to 
remember," one diplomat says, "that this is, after all, Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Panama is a country where elections are seen as wars, candidates challenging 
the incumbent are branded traitors, opposition news media are banned and 
foreign journalists are threatened with arrest and deportation for wearing 
American-issued press credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Duque, who heads the ticket of the Nationalist Liberation Coalition, an 
alliance of eight parties that back military strongman Manuel A. Noriega, 
acknowledges that he will be a figurehead and will take no action independent 
of Gen. Noriega, the nation's real ruler. Noriega is a former U.S. ally and CIA 
contact whom Washington would now like to see deposed. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega has repeatedly declared that he will not accept a presidential victory 
by Guillermo Endara, 53, candidate of the Civic Opposition Democratic Alliance, 
who brags about consulting two or three times a week with American Embassy 
officials and says he will dismiss Noriega from the post that forms his power 
base, commander of the Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's ouster is the price that the United States has put on ending the 
economic sanctions that have helped cripple Panama's economy over the last 
year. The Reagan Administration imposed the sanctions in an effort to push 
Noriega out of power after he was indicted in Florida on charges related to 
drug-trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing to Lose 
</P>
<P>
In the face of Endara's popularity, the U.S. indictments and Bush 
Administration's statements that it will not recognize a victory by Duque, 
Noriega has decided he has nothing to lose if he is accused of electoral fraud, 
many analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian people clearly prefer anyone but Noriega and his front man. 
Public opinion surveys, including two released this week by widely respected 
polling organizations, give credence to claims by opposition figures and U.S. 
diplomats that the only way Duque can win is through massive fraud. 
</P>
<P>
A poll commissioned by Univision, an American Spanish-language television 
network, showed that Endara is backed by 61% of the voters against 27% for 
Duque. Another opposition figure, Hildebrando Nicosia, candidate of a remnant 
of former President Arnulfo Arias' Panamanian Party, was backed by 3% of the 
sample. Poll respondents were allowed to give their opinions in secret ballots 
rather than stating their opinions to questioners. 
</P>
<P>
A second survey done by a Venezuelan polling firm, Doxa, C.A., gave Endara 67% 
and Duque 31%. 
</P>
<P>
The Univision poll also indicated that 61% of Panamanians believe Duque will 
win by fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Although Noriega supporters say that Duque will win honestly and deny plans for 
any fraud, independent human rights organizations, foreign observers and 
diplomats say that Noriega has put in place all the necessary machinery to 
overcome these poll numbers and then repress any public outcry against such 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation carried out by former President Jimmy Carter and other Western 
Hemisphere notables found that there has been an increase of 29% in registered 
voters this year over 1984, the last time elections were held. Yet the current 
census shows the voting age population grew only 4% in that time. 
</P>
<P>
In one district cited by Americas Watch, a U.S.-based human rights group, the 
government registered 725 voters, more than the total number of residents. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, these new registrations, real or otherwise, amount to 150,000 
voters out of a total of 1.2 million eligible citizens. Even if all these new 
voters are for Duque, the opposition and others say that he could not win the 
election honestly. They charge that Noriega is committed to these other tactics 
to steal the election: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Military and security forces who legally are banned from interfering or 
participating in the campaign regularly attend government rallies, while 
officers frequently speak publicly on Duque's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Newly formed popular militia forces called "dignity battalions" have been 
armed with automatic weapons. The newspaper Critica, an unqualified supporter 
of Noriega, has reported that rich neighborhoods will be punished by the 
battalions if they support Endara. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Voters in areas considered opposition strongholds have been assigned voting 
locations long distances from their homes. Taxi and bus drivers say in 
interviews that they are being discouraged from transporting voters from 
pro-opposition areas on election day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- National identity cards and voter registration cards of the dead have been 
issued to Duque supporters. Opposition leaders say that a survey of Panama City 
alone indicated that the names of more than 27% of those who had died in a 
recent period are on Sunday's voter registration lists. One government employee 
demonstrated in an interview that he held five separate identity cards, all 
with different names but all with his photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Government employees say many of them have been told to turn in the names 
and identity card numbers of three family members to be entered as members of 
the Nationalist Coalition, while their supervisors have been directed to 
provide political profiles of their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Opposition candidates for the more than 575 offices at stake Sunday have 
been declared ineligible at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
And if all that does not work, there is the Electoral Tribunal, the final 
decision-maker concerning the vote count. Its members were named by Noriega 
and, the opposition claims, all are intimately connected to the general. 
</P>
<P>
"The most serious impediment to the election's securing the acceptance of a 
large majority of Panamanians," said former President Carter's report, "is lack 
of confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Electoral Tribunal." 
</P>
<P>
Confidence in the tribunal was not strengthened when the government issued 
rules saying that reporters, including foreign correspondents, are prohibited 
from reporting any vote count except those issued by the tribunal. This means 
the public will not find out about any challenge to the official numbers, 
diplomatic and opposition sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure would make it a crime to carry press credentials not issued by 
the government, a measure apparently designed to discourage reporters from 
accepting or carrying press cards issued by SouthCom, the U.S. military 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
The government says that all allegations of fraud are nonsense engineered by 
the United States. Aquilino Boyd, one of Duque's two vice presidential running 
mates, points to news accounts in the United States that President Bush 
authorized $10 million in secret aid to support Endara's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
But, Boyd said in an interview, "Such flagrant foreign intervention is working 
in our favor. It motivates the masses to unify and work for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to win," he said, "You can see it in the streets and our polls 
show it." 
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to disclose numbers, pointing instead to a Nationalist 
Coalition demonstration last week in Panama City that drew about 100,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders say they will triumph nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
"The public's will is just too strong," Guillermo Ford, an opposition vice 
presidential candidate, said in an interview. "Besides, this is the last 
opportunity we have to solve the economic and political crisis peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have weapons, and we don't want (violent) confrontations, but the 
people are not willing to put up with fraud," Ford added. "If Noriega does not 
come to his senses, he risks having all hell break loose with a tremendous 
explosion."

ROAD TO PEACE IN LEBANON RUNS THROUGH SYRIA

<P>
In Lebanon, a nasty neighborhood of militias, suspicions and seething feuds, 
the Syrian army is the big boy on the block, a bully to some and a protector to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 13 years, the Syrians have salvaged the Lebanese Christians from 
a Palestinian onslaught, given arms to Muslim militias and pulled back in the 
face of an Israeli invasion. They also helped engineer a radical uprising 
within Yasser Arafat's mainstream guerrilla faction of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, a revolt that resulted in Arafat's loyalists being ousted from 
northern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
They have meddled in Lebanese politics to the point where no political 
settlement is deemed possible without a blessing in Damascus, the Syrian 
capital, 50 miles southeast of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Yet never has Syria declared its long-term aims in Lebanon -- even now, with 
40,000 armed men deployed in the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Do Not Negotiate' 
</P>
<P>
Others have not been so reluctant. Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, commander of the 
mainly Christian Lebanese army and head of a military cabinet in Christian East 
Beirut, declared at the height of the artillery war between his forces and the 
Syrian army with its Muslim militia allies last month: "The decision to 
confront the Syrian presence was imposed on us by the Syrians because they do 
not negotiate and (want to force us to) put our seal of approval to a total 
subordination of Lebanon to Syria." 
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh, in his recent talks with French 
President Francois Mitterrand in Paris, put his country's goals in a more 
beneficent light. He said the Damascus government is intent on helping the 
Lebanese with their problems, proposing political reforms to increase the power 
of the Muslim majority, and also wants to "unite all Lebanese and make them 
feel they belong to one homeland where they are equal in status and rights." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the specific Syrian objectives in Lebanon, they go beyond helping 
their small neighboring state, according to authorities on Middle Eastern 
politics. They are also driven by the Israeli-Palestinian issue, Syria's own 
security concerns and the ambitions of Hafez Assad, the Syrian president. 
</P>
<P>
Assad, in power in Damascus since 1970, is a formidable leader in the Middle 
East. As president of a country with minimal resources beyond a Soviet-trained 
and Soviet-supplied army, he has had some hard times over two decades but 
played his few cards wisely. He is, diplomats in Damascus say, a man who gets 
his way by saying no. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands the geopolitical process better than any of the (other Arab 
leaders)," a Western envoy commented recently. "He is politically astute, and 
his strong card is patience." 
</P>
<P>
A leader of the so-called Rejectionist Front opposing any negotiations with 
Israel, Assad now finds himself almost alone as his former rejectionist allies 
have given Arafat the green light to try to make a deal. Arafat and Assad are 
the best of enemies, the diplomat said -- "They just don't like each other." 
And now, he went on, "Assad is content to let (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak) 
Shamir do his job on Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
The Syrians "dig in and see what happens," the diplomat said, adding: "They're 
not really the people to take the initiative. They're reactive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indispensable Man 
</P>
<P>
Following that line in Lebanon since his forces first entered the country in 
1976, under the Arab League's imprimatur as a peacemaker at the onset of the 
Lebanese civil war, Assad has become an indispensable man in Lebanese crises, a 
man with influence in Lebanon that extends beyond the power of his army. 
</P>
<P>
When sectarian fighting escalated in Lebanon in 1985, militia leaders trooped 
to Damascus and, under Syrian tutelage, forged a pact to give the Muslims a 
greater share of power. The pact also gave wide powers to Syria within Lebanon. 
Christian traditionalists rose in defiance. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders responded by turning their backs on Amin Gemayel, the Christian 
president, and, in 1987, demanded a return to Beirut of Syrian troops, five 
years after the Israelis had punched northward to the outskirts of Beirut and 
driven the Syrians eastward into the Bekaa Valley. Today, with the Israelis 
gone from Lebanon except for a six-mile-deep strip along their border, the 
Syrian army remains, about 6,000 troops in West Beirut and 34,000 more in the 
Bekaa and elsewhere in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
This week, as Arab League diplomats have tried to work out a cease-fire in the 
latest round of Lebanese fighting, their first stop was Damascus. Even if Assad 
wanted to wash his hands of Lebanon, he dare not for several reasons, say the 
experts. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Any weakening of his pro-Muslim stance in Lebanese politics would undercut 
the position he has taken as an Arab leader, the hard man in the struggle with 
the Israelis. In two decades, he has never wavered on this point. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From a security point of view, with Israeli troops still occupying their 
strip of southern Lebanon, the cautious and untrusting Syrian president could 
potentially put his country's western flank at risk in any future war with 
Israel. So Syria insists that its troops will not leave Lebanon until the 
Israelis do, underlining the prime cause for its continued presence there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Without direct influence in Lebanon, Syria would have diminished political 
control there. Damascus would be served by increased Muslim power in Beirut, 
but many analysts argue that it is served even better by keeping the Lebanese 
factions at each other's throats, weakening the central government and making 
it more pliable to Syrian demands. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the current round of fighting, others have accused Syria of more 
nefarious reasons for hanging on in Lebanon. The conflict began in early March 
when Aoun, seeking to extend his government's control and recover lost 
revenues, imposed a blockade on "illegal" ports operated by Syria's Muslim 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Francois Deniau, a member of the French National Assembly, who was 
instrumental in arranging a shipment of fuel and food into besieged Beirut on 
French vessels, declared in an interview with a French weekly that the 
Syrian-controlled Bekaa is a center of opium production "which secures wealth 
to Syria and the militias." He suggested that drugs left Lebanon through the 
blockaded ports. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Underpinning current politics are the historical ties between Syria and 
Lebanon. Under centuries of Ottoman Turkish rule, Syria encompassed its little 
neighbor, which was then known as a part of Syria called the Lebanon. Under a 
post-World War I mandate following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the 
French ruled in Syria and carved out Lebanon as a separate state, one with 
special privileges for Christians. The independent Lebanon turned to the West, 
becoming in some ways as European as it was Arab. Syria remained close to its 
heritage as a center of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, some Syrian maps show no border between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Many Lebanese, particularly the Christians, insist that Damascus intends to 
impose the past on Lebanon's future.

A congressional panel looking into scientific fraud said Thursday the Secret 
Service found "significant" alterations in notebooks used to support a paper 
co-authored by Nobel Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations, said the Secret Service probe "confirmed that the data and 
authenticity of parts of the key notebook were questionable." 
</P>
<P>
But Baltimore countered that nothing uncovered by the Secret Service indicates 
wrongdoing or would change the scientific conclusions of his research. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell said entries purported to have been recorded in 1984 and 1985 were 
actually made in the spring of 1986 -- after the controversial paper, 
describing mouse experiments on genetic control of the immune system, had 
already been published.

THE NORTH VERDICT; 
</P>
<P>
JUROR DISTASTE FOR HIGHER-UPS SEEN IN VERDICT

It found him three times a felon, but the jury that sat in judgment of former 
National Security Council aide Oliver L. North also demonstrated considerable 
sympathy for the central theme of his defense -- that North was not the master 
conspirator of the Iran-Contra scandal but only an instrument of higher 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
And at least in the eyes of former prosecutors and experienced defense lawyers, 
Thursday's verdict of guilty on three charges and not guilty on nine others was 
yet another demonstration that American juries can be smarter than their 
critics -- able to sort through tangled cases that experts predict will 
befuddle them. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective jurors in the North trial were accepted only if they had no 
knowledge of the widely publicized case. That led some critics to suggest at 
the outset that individuals so isolated and out of touch with current events 
could never understand the intricate chain of events or grasp the fine points 
of applicable law. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, only one member of the final panel had education beyond the high school 
level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Careful Distinctions 
</P>
<P>
Yet in rendering their verdict after 12 days of deliberations, the jurors 
appear to have made some fairly careful distinctions among the complex charges. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems as if what they were doing was acquitting him where there was 
evidence of higher authority," said Jamie Gorelick, a prominent white-collar 
defense lawyer. "It sounds as if his defense that he was doing what he was told 
to do was well taken." 
</P>
<P>
Often, noted Judge Leonard B. Sand, a long-time trial judge in U.S. District 
Court in Manhattan, "it's possible by sifting through the evidence and the 
charges to find the jury's reasons" for convicting on some counts, acquitting 
on others. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, noted former Justice Department official Victoria Toensing, the 
jury seems in particular to have shown distaste for the prosecution's use of 
North's one-time boss, former National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane, as 
a witness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Plea Bargain 
</P>
<P>
"To offer the higher-up a plea bargain is very difficult if he's then going to 
come in and testify against his subordinate," Toensing said. "Most of the time, 
prosecutors don't do that." The more common practice is to strike a bargain 
with subordinates to obtain their testimony against higher-ups. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane pleaded guilty last year to four misdemeanor counts of misleading 
Congress about the Iran-Contra scandal and was sentenced shortly before he 
testified in North's case to pay a $20,000 fine. He also received a two-year 
sentence, which was suspended, meaning that he will not have to spend any time 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 charges on which North was indicted last year, four of them related 
to letters that North drafted for McFarlane to send to Congress. North was 
acquitted on all four counts. 
</P>
<P>
The letters falsely stated that North was not involved in efforts to aide the 
Nicaraguan rebels. During the trial, McFarlane told the jury that North had 
written the letters, but he insisted that he bore "full responsibility" for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, prosecutor John W. Keker expressed open exasperation with 
McFarlane -- his own witness. "Mr. McFarlane," he said at one point, "you 
already have pleaded guilty. It is Col. North who is on trial here." 
</P>
<P>
North, testifying in his own defense, told the jury that he had urged McFarlane 
not to send the letters and simply to refuse to respond to congressional 
inquiries about North's activities. McFarlane, he said, rejected that advice. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth charge on which North also was acquitted involved a meeting with 
members of Congress in the White House Situation Room in which North again 
denied being involved in efforts to aid the Contras. In that case, North 
testified, he was acting under orders of his new boss, John M. Poindexter, who 
had replaced McFarlane. Poindexter, who has also been indicted, did not testify 
at North's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Split verdicts in complicated cases are a common occurrence, one that 
prosecutors often count on in drafting their indictments, Toensing said. "It's 
a group dynamics thing," she said. "You give the jury enough to sort of sit 
back and toss a few away," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just intense pressure to compromise" once the jury begins 
deliberating, said Gorelick. "What a defense lawyer can do to try to prevent it 
is impress on juries that the defendant is going to be a felon whether it's one 
count or 12." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps surprisingly, such a jury decision often has little impact on the kind 
of sentence a defendant receives. 
</P>
<P>
North, for example, was charged with 12 different crimes. In theory, had he 
been convicted of all counts, he could have been sentenced to 60 years in 
prison. And in theory, on the three charges on which he was convicted, he could 
be sentenced to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, judges in federal courts almost never sentence defendants to serve 
consecutive sentences on each conviction. Instead, they order the sentences to 
be served simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
So even if North had been convicted of all counts, he probably would not have 
been sentenced to more than five years in prison -- the sentence for most of 
the counts against him. And because one of the three counts on which he was 
convicted carries a maximum five-year sentence, he still could receive such a 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

SPOTLIGHT DIMS ON NORTH GLORY DAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
It was nearly two years ago that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North basked in the 
spotlight at the Iran-Contra hearings -- rows of multicolored medals gleaming 
on the chest of his Marine uniform, a grin on his lips and a stack of adoring 
telegrams from well-wishers on the table in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
North, the former presidential adviser with a Rambo-like reputation, was an 
instant media sensation after his congressional testimony in the summer of 
1987. The whole nation seemed taken by his personality. Even President Ronald 
Reagan, who had fired North from the White House staff, described him as "a 
national hero." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no longer any hint of smugness, no outpouring of congratulations, 
no public hysteria Thursday when North, who has since retired from the Marines 
and now earns a living making speeches, was found guilty of violating the law 
while at the White House. Although he was cleared on most charges, Ollie 
North's glory days appear to be over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favorite Cause 
</P>
<P>
The story of North's downfall is well-known. It is the tale of a zealous 
presidential aide who, while he was involved in the covert sales of arms to 
Iran, came up with a scheme to divert the profits to the President's favorite 
cause -- the rebels in Nicaragua. When the plan became public in late 1986, the 
blame largely fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, despite all that has been disclosed about North's role in the 
Iran-Contra scandal, his true motives are in some ways still a mystery. Neither 
the testimony in his trial nor the evidence presented at congressional hearings 
have revealed fully why North, a trained military man who was used to following 
orders, allegedly exceeded his authority to mastermind one of the most unusual 
White House scandals in American history. 
</P>
<P>
North contends that he was motivated primarily by ideology and a desire to rid 
Central America of the scourge of communism. But evidence has been presented 
about other possible factors, including a strong desire to portray himself as 
being at the center of power, a personal need for money and perhaps a tendency 
to test the limits of the system. 
</P>
<P>
All of his life, North, 45, has been an achiever -- a disciplined man with a 
remarkable capacity for work. After growing up in Philmont, N.Y., he attended a 
state university on a scholarship for one year, later was graduated from the 
U.S. Naval Academy and served with distinction in Vietnam. In every situation, 
his teachers and superior officers were impressed by his devotion to duty. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was no surprise that in 1981, when North first was assigned to the 
National Security Council staff at the White House, he was instantly seen by 
his superiors as a model employee -- someone who could cut through the 
bureaucracy to get things done. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, North sought and carried out some of the toughest 
assignments facing the NSC. He not only worked long hours but became known for 
his habit of rousting other government officials out of bed late at night to 
get them to do what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
He was involved initially in the Reagan Administration's successful drive for 
congressional approval for selling the AWACS radar surveillance plane to Saudi 
Arabia and later took charge of counterterrorism and U.S. assistance to the 
Contras. Perhaps his biggest success was the U.S. capture of the Palestinians 
who had hijacked the Italian cruise ship, Achille Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his work on behalf of the Contras that North seemed to like best, 
perhaps because it appealed to his strong sense of patriotism. Since his youth, 
North had been a flag-waving patriot. Eventually, he even developed a 30-minute 
slide show designed to dramatize how democracy in the hemisphere hinged on U.S. 
support of the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
But what made North special at the Reagan White House was something more than 
his devotion to democracy and his capacity for hard work. He is simply the kind 
of person that people like -- a man whose sincerity and respect for authority 
make him loved by his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Two of North's associates, former White House National Security Adviser Robert 
C. McFarlane and Albert A. Hakim, the financial middleman for the Iran-Contra 
affair, both testified that they loved North as if he were their own son. Hakim 
even tried, without success, to find a legal way to give $200,000 to North's 
family from the Iran-Contra proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, North's relationship with the late CIA Director William J. Casey 
appears to have been the same kind of father-son affair. North, who spent an 
unusual amount of time huddled with the CIA director in his private office at 
the Old Executive Office Building, contends that it was Casey who privately 
encouraged him to establish a covert supply network for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
North's success at the White House was not entirely the result of charm and 
hustle, however. There was also a darker side to him, according to some 
colleagues -- a cunning, manipulative side that got out of control in the heady 
atmosphere created by the power and prestige of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Flair for Melodrama' 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, those colleagues have said, North often lied to make people 
think he was friends with such important people as former Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger. He also displayed what one friend described as "a flair for 
melodrama." 
</P>
<P>
North's colleagues recognized this aspect of his personality long before the 
Iran-Contra affair was exposed. In fact, they say that it became most apparent 
about the same time that Congress cut off aid to the Contras in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"By late 1984," said Constantine C. Menges, a former Reagan aide, "I had 
reluctantly concluded that North was regularly exaggerating and reshaping 
events and was increasingly seeking to impress people through 'personal hype.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Among the self-aggrandizing falsehoods that North told in those days was that 
he had been involved in many private meetings with the President -- meetings he 
has since admitted never took place. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the Iran-Contra affair was exposed was it learned that North had been 
admitted to Bethesda Naval Medical Center in 1974 for emotional exhaustion. The 
record of his hospitalization apparently had been expunged from the record by 
one of his superiors to protect his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Contra affair reflected both sides of North's character -- the hustle 
as well has his penchant for self-promotion. As he has testified, North did not 
embark on the diversion of funds without the approval of his boss, 
then-National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. But he allegedly chose to 
carry out the task in a way that sometimes exceeded his authority and he 
clearly enjoyed the cloak-and-dagger aspect of it -- even using code names such 
as "Mr. Good" when he traveled.

THE NORTH VERDICT;

<P>
NEWLY RELEASED DATA FILL IN LINES OF IRAN-CONTRA PUZZLE

<P>
The meeting in the White House Situation Room was almost five years ago, but 
the minutes are still officially stamped SECRET. It was June 25, 1984, and 
President Ronald Reagan and his advisers were arguing heatedly over how to get 
aid to Nicaragua's Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Baker (then White House chief of staff) said that if we go out and try to 
get money from third countries, it is an impeachable offense," warned Secretary 
of State George P. Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
"I am entitled to complete the record," CIA Director William J. Casey shot 
back. " . . . Once he learned that the finding (a presidential order on aiding 
the Contras) does encourage cooperation from third countries, Jim Baker 
immediately dropped his view that this could be an impeachable offense -- and 
you heard him say that, George." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cautions on Reciprocity 
</P>
<P>
"How can anyone object to the United States encouraging third parties to 
provide help to the anti-Sandinistas?" asked Vice President George Bush. "The 
only problem that might come up is if the United States were to promise to give 
these third parties something in return so that some people could interpret 
this as some kind of an exchange." 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope none of this discussion will be made public in any way," said 
National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, President Ronald Reagan spoke up. "If such a story gets out," he 
said, "we'll all be hanging by our thumbs in front of the White House until we 
find out who did it" -- apparently a warning to anyone who might be tempted to 
leak the information. 
</P>
<P>
But the story is out now -- an unexpected byproduct of the trial of former 
White House aide Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his defense against charges that he lied to Congress, shredded 
documents and misused government funds, North's lawyers forced the government 
to provide hundreds of pages of once-secret records as evidence -- a stack 
about four inches high. 
</P>
<P>
And despite more than two years of earlier investigations of the Iran-Contra 
scandal, by both Congress and a White House commission, the newly released 
documents have added significantly to what already was known about the long and 
tangled affair. 
</P>
<P>
They disclose that Reagan approved a scheme to send new aid to Honduras as what 
McFarlane called a "quid pro quo" for that country's aid to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
They show that President Bush, who has long insisted that he knew almost 
nothing about the secret effort to aid the Contras, was aware of that action -- 
and personally encouraged Honduras to continue its support for the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
They have reopened the historical debate over the nature of Reagan's 
presidency: was he a detached chief executive, unaware of what his underlings 
were doing, as the presidential commission headed by former Sen. John Tower 
(R-Tex.) concluded in 1987? Or was he the secret mastermind of the Iran-Contra 
affair, far more active and engaged than most accounts have portrayed him? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Withheld Documents at Issue 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they have raised new questions about whether the White House withheld 
documents from the congressional committees investigating the scandal, despite 
Reagan's promises to cooperate fully. Both Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) and Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House 
Iran-Contra Committee, have said that the trial turned up significant documents 
that their panels never saw, and Congress' two intelligence committees have 
launched investigations of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate effect of the new disclosures may be to erode Bush's 
credibility, one of the President's greatest assets in his first months in 
office. Last week, The Times Poll found that 51% of the public believes that 
Bush has lied about the Iran-Contra events. About 35% said that the trial has 
made them believe that Bush was more deeply involved in the scandal than they 
had realized; 16% said that they now think he was less involved. 
</P>
<P>
And 67% of the public believes that North was only following orders and is 
taking the blame for Iran-Contra to protect both Bush and former President 
Reagan, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insisted He Knew Little 
</P>
<P>
During the 1987 investigations of the scandal and his 1988 presidential 
campaign, Bush insisted that he knew little or nothing about the secret effort 
to fund the Contras during the period when Congress prohibited U.S. aid to the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
But the documents indicate that Bush was well-informed about the Reagan 
Administration's efforts to persuade Honduras and other countries to support 
the rebels. And when Reagan signed a 1985 directive authorizing accelerated 
economic and military aid for Honduras as "incentives for them to persist in 
aiding the freedom fighters," Bush was sent a copy of the order. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that directive was signed, Bush visited Honduras and met with the 
country's president, Roberto Suazo Cordova. Officials who were present said 
that Bush discussed Honduras' aid to the Contras, but he did not describe it as 
a quid pro quo for U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no quid pro quo (in the meeting with Suazo)," Bush told reporters 
Thursday. "Everybody that attended the meeting says that there was no quid pro 
quo." But he did not address the larger issue of whether he knew about or 
approved the deal with Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
See Spirit of Law Violated 
</P>
<P>
The documents show that North and others at the National Security Council 
understood that they were violating the spirit of the law by engineering Contra 
aid from other countries. "Notwithstanding our own interpretations, it is very 
clear . . . that the legislative intent was to deny any direct or indirect 
support for military/paramilitary operations in Nicaragua," North wrote in a 
memorandum to McFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
And they show that while President Reagan may have been detached from the 
details of his policies, he was fully informed of the efforts to aid the 
Contras -- and personally approved actions to carry out the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan signed several directives authorizing aid to Honduras in exchange for 
that country's help for the Contras, personally telephoned Honduran President 
Suazo to ask his help and approved a North plan to airdrop recoilless rifles to 
the Contras so they could attempt to sink a ship carrying arms to Nicaragua, 
the documents show. 
</P>
<P>
When the scandal first erupted, Reagan denied knowing anything about the NSC 
efforts to aid the Contras. He later changed his story and said that seeking 
foreign aid had been "my idea to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role Unclear on Arms Profits 
</P>
<P>
However, the trial has not shed any new light on whether Reagan knew of North's 
action in skimming profits for the Contras from the secret sale of arms to 
Iran. North testified -- as he did before Congress in 1987 -- that he did not 
know whether Reagan had authorized that scheme. Reagan has repeatedly denied 
any knowledge of the diversion. 
</P>
<P>
"At each stage of the process in which more information has been made 
available, President Reagan's involvement becomes clearer and more deep," Sen. 
Mitchell said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Congress might reopen the Iran-Contra affair and investigate the 
actions of Reagan and Bush again, Mitchell said that seemed unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"History will render the final verdict," he said.

'NUCLEAR WINTER' SCIENTIST TO SHARE 1989 TYLER PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scientist who helped develop the theory that nuclear war could plunge Earth 
into a "nuclear winter" will share the 1989 Tyler Prize with a chemist who 
pioneered studies of ocean pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The prize for environmental achievement, administered by USC, will be awarded 
tonight to Paul Crutzen, director of atmospheric chemistry at West Germany's 
Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, and Edward Goldberg, of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
They will split the $150,000 prize money and receive gold medallions, according 
to the prize committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ozone Discoveries 
</P>
<P>
The group credited Crutzen with important discoveries about the depletion of 
Earth's protective high-altitude ozone layer, the formation of ozone as a 
pollutant at lower altitudes, the "nuclear winter" theory and "humanity's 
capacity to upset the global atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Crutzen's research indicating that the ozone layer could be harmed by nitrogen 
oxide pollutants played a role in the debate over supersonic transport aircraft 
in the 1970s. It also helped lead to later discoveries that refrigerant gases 
called chlorofluorocarbons were damaging Earth's ozone shield, the prize 
committee said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Crutzen and scientist John Birks published a paper titled "The 
Atmosphere After a Nuclear War: Twilight at Noon." They hypothesized that fires 
from nuclear warfare would blanket Earth with smoke, blocking enough sunlight 
to damage food crops. 
</P>
<P>
The prize committee said it was the fundamental paper that led another group of 
scientists to coin the term "nuclear winter" and demonstrate that nuclear war 
could temporarily plunge the planet into freezing temperatures and cause mass 
starvation of war survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, a chemistry professor at Scripps, dedicated much of his career to 
monitoring and finding solutions to ocean pollution, the Tyler committee said. 
</P>
<P>

He helped get toxic tributyl tin boat paints banned in California, started the 
"Mussel Watch" program to monitor ocean pollutant levels by measuring toxic 
contaminants in oysters and mussels, and pioneered ocean pollution research on 
DDT, radioactive substances, heavy metals and hydrocarbons.

The committee also said Goldberg has pushed for using the oceans as safe 
dumping grounds for non-toxic waste to reduce air and ground-water pollution 
due to waste burning and landfill disposal.

UC SAN DIEGO SEA EXPERT WILL SHARE SCIENCE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A UC San Diego chemical oceanographer who has concentrated on finding solutions 
to ocean pollution has been named as co-recipient of the nation's most 
prestigious environmental science award. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Goldberg of UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, will 
receive the Tyler Prize tonight at a dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg shares the $150,000 prize with Paul Crutzen, an atmospheric chemist in 
West Germany, who in 1982 co-wrote the scientific paper that originated the 
ideas behind what was later termed "nuclear winter." 
</P>
<P>
The paper proposed that a nuclear war would have the previously unanticipated 
result of sending so much smoke into the atmosphere that it would threaten life 
worldwide by blocking out the sun. The director of the prestigious Max Planck 
Institute for Chemistry in West Germany, Crutzen also was instrumental in the 
early recognition that man-made chemicals might deplete the Earth's protective 
ozone later. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining Scripps in 1949, Goldberg has dedicated his career to monitoring 
ocean pollution and finding ways to remedy it. He worked to get the state 
Legislature to ban toxic tributyl tin marine paints in California and proposed 
and inaugurated the widely used program to monitor pollution by measuring the 
levels of contaminants in mussels. 
</P>
<P>
"Edward Goldberg is the most innovative, influential scholar to ponder, 
investigate, write and speak about ocean pollution problems," said John W. 
Farrington, professor of environmental sciences at the University of 
Massachusetts, in commenting on the award. 
</P>
<P>
Established to honor landmark discoveries confirming humanity's capacity to 
upset the global environmental balance, the Tyler Prize was endowed in 1973 by 
Alice C. Tyler and her late husband, John C. Tyler, who founded Farmers 
Insurance Group. The prize is administered by USC. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Prize winners are selected by a committee of scientists from nominations 
received worldwide. There have been 25 recipients, including UC San Diego 
founder Roger Revelle in 1984.

67 ORANGE COUNTY TRANSIT BUSES ARE SIDELINED

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County officials pulled 67 buses from service Thursday as a 
precautionary measure after mechanics found cracks that caused the rear 
suspension on two buses to collapse last week, dropping coaches onto the rear 
axles. 
</P>
<P>
The removal, the largest in the history of the Orange County Transit District, 
will lead to some delays in service, officials said. The buses withdrawn from 
service represent more than 15% of the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the suspect buses was equipped with a hydraulic lift to accommodate 
wheelchair-bound patrons. Transit officials said lift-equipped vans will be 
dispatched if regular buses cannot accommodate those seeking service. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in either incident in which suspensions collapsed, officials 
said.

A VALLEY GIRL WHO BEAT NOVEL ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONA GABLE, Mona Gable is a Los Angeles writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Established novelist Mary Gordon was a guest on the show. So was critic and 
biographer James Atlas. Then there was first-time novelist Jane Vandenburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"I pronounced myself a Valley girl," Vandenburgh says with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Vandenburgh, who grew up in Northridge, is talking about her performance the 
week before on the very highbrow PBS series, "Bookmark." She was there plugging 
her first novel, "Failure to Zigzag" (North Point Press: $16.95), a darkly 
funny mother-daughter story set in Southern California in the late '50s and 
early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance on the show, which is hosted by literary heavyweight Lewis 
Lapham and is taped in New York, was heady stuff for an author whose first 
novel about Southern California was rejected by every publisher she approached 
and whose book was finally, miraculously plucked from a slush pile of 
unsolicited manuscripts by an editor who not only looked at it, but liked it. 
</P>
<P>
Vandenburgh, who lives now in Oakland, is huddled over breakfast at the Hyatt 
Hotel at the airport. She's laughing about the "Valley girl" crack and it's not 
just because of the show's staid tone. The whole notion is absurd. She's 40, 
married to a professor who teaches James Joyce at San Francisco State, where 
Jane Vandenburgh earned a master's in creative writing, and has two children, 
Noah, 8, and Eva, 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Years of Mailings 
</P>
<P>
After five years at the typewriter, between editing jobs and raising her 
children, Vandenburgh had spent another three years sending her manuscript to 
New York publishers and agents. Although she'd once worked as an editor at 
Chronicle Books and had contacts in publishing, when it came time to show 
agents her novel she decided not to use an agent in her approaches to 
publishers. "I wanted someone to take it for the love of the book." 
</P>
<P>
A commendable idea, but it didn't work. "I had 23 rejections of this novel," 
Vandenburgh says, shaking her head. Publishers weren't interested because she 
didn't have an agent and only two published short stories to her credit. Agents 
weren't interested because she was an unknown writer. 
</P>
<P>
But they were also turned off by Vandenburgh's unsentimental treatment of her 
schizophrenic mother character, Katrinka. "They'd say, 'not for us,' " recalls 
Vandenburgh, who admits she finds her character "vulgar" and a terrible mother. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Vandenburgh submitted the manuscript to North Point, the prestigious 
small literary press in Berkeley. And though it languished there in the pile 
for six months, when editor Kate Moses picked it out and read it she 
immediately fell in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
Vandenburgh figures the chances of her manuscript being accepted there were "1 
in 32,000." And the fact that it was still seems to astound her. "I don't 
believe in God, but I do believe in North Point." 
</P>
<P>
It's a version that Lisa Ross, subsidiary rights director at North Point, does 
not dispute. "What is clear about this book is it seems somehow blessed, in 
that it's beating the odds in publishing. The odds for an unagented manuscript 
to be read and accepted are so extraordinarily low that just its publication is 
a small miracle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Characters 
</P>
<P>
"It actually became a cause celebre in-house," Ross says. "The characters are 
so strong and the language is so fun and unusual, everyone was speaking like 
Katrinka. It was a book that everybody felt special about." 
</P>
<P>
Though it's too soon to tell, Ross believes the novel has the potential to be a 
strong seller. Avon has already set a floor for the paperback rights at 
$30,000, and 12 houses are in the bidding. Beyond that, "it's being very 
well-reviewed," Ross says. "Jane is appearing on 'Bookmark,' and for them to 
focus on a first novel is very unusual. Also, there's a lot of movie interest. 
We have two option offers, and I think we'll be receiving more. It's very much 
a word-of-mouth book as well. People read it and are so enthusiastic they tell 
all their friends about it. So that's a good sign for the book as well." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Vandenburgh feels vindicated -- by the publication, some 
favorable reviews, a positive response from readers, the movie offers. (Bette 
Midler is interested, but Vandenburgh would like to see Tracey Ullman play 
Katrinka.) 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to like Katrinka," she says, sounding somewhat surprised. "They 
don't say, she's a bad woman, a bad mother. I think we all have our 
Katrinka-esque days, especially those of us who are mothers and aspire to some 
kind of artistic career." 
</P>
<P>
If you crossed Lucy Ricardo with Blanche Dubois, she'd come out acting pretty 
much like Katrinka. She's an alcoholic and a ventriloquist, and she talks 
loudly in public and calls her auditory hallucinations "Space Radio." Her idea 
of cuisine is a loaf of French bread stuffed with an ear of corn and drowned in 
canned peaches or a mayonnaise and olive sandwich. Her idea of housework is to 
pile all the laundry in the sink and let it ferment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survival Attempts 
</P>
<P>
The story basically revolves around her daughter Charlotte's efforts to survive 
this. And, for that matter, to survive the repressive rantings of her equally 
nutty maternal grandparents, Lionel and Winnie, with whom she lives when 
Katrinka's locked up in Camarillo State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Vandenburgh's own childhood was more like "Father Knows Best" meets "The Brady 
Bunch." A fourth-generation Californian, and one of eight children, Vandenburgh 
comes from a family of "staid, pretentious Republicans." (Who aren't all that 
different from her characters Winnie and Lionel, she notes wryly.) Her mother 
was a housewife, her father an executive with Lockheed, and most of her 
relatives lived in Orange, Glendale and Redondo Beach -- places that also 
figure prominently in her book. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Vivid Memories 
</P>
<P>
Her vivid memories of growing up here and her interest in California history 
led her to write about Southern California. Lionel, for instance, a former 
successful banker who lost everything in the '29 crash, is obsessed with Bank 
of America founder A. P. Giannini. He lies on the couch all day, reading and 
rereading the same Charles Dickens books, going to the phone "believing it 
might be some powerful banker -- A. P. Giannini? . . . who was calling him 
home." 
</P>
<P>
There's also a strong indication that this rock-ribbed Republican, this 
teetotaler who harangues Charlotte about the dangers of "drink," may be a child 
molester. It's all part of Vandenburgh's take on sinister California. "I 
believe a lot of scoundrels ended up here," she says, "people who were far 
removed from the structures of a more extended family. Did Katrinka really go 
to bed with her father? I don't know. But I think that typically does happen 
when the family is shorn away. Lionel and Winnie don't work, they don't go out, 
so there's no one to make them face up to what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest in Ventriloquism 
</P>
<P>
Katrinka did not arise out of Vandenburgh's own experience, but from an 
interest in writing about a ventriloquist. But she was also inspired by her 
view of the "downside" of Lucy Ricardo. 
</P>
<P>
Of Lucy and similar Lucille Ball roles, Vandenburgh recalls, "We were supposed 
to think she was very funny. I remember sitting in the theater as a kid, seeing 
her in this movie 'The Long Long Trailer,' with this trailer swinging out all 
over the road, and it was awful. It was sort of a metaphor for housekeeping, 
trying to be the good 1950s housewife." 
</P>
<P>
A more recent inspiration, she said, is all the adults her age who constantly 
complain about their parents. Practically everyone in Berkeley is in either AA 
or Al-Anon, she groans, and it's "all this sort of whining," and, taking the 
line from a Woody Allen movie, she'd like to tell them "Just grow up!" That's 
one reason she wanted to write about schizophrenia: to show the "monumental 
hurdles in each child's life." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, "dealing with these characters" made it a tough book to 
write, "even though I have a feeling Charlotte is going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Vandenburgh strongly believed in Katrinka when everyone else didn't. Everyone, 
that is, except her husband, who thought the book was hilarious, and a friend 
who'd take her out to lunch every time she rewrote the book. And it was that 
faith that kept her going. 
</P>
<P>
Vandenburgh has completed the second draft of her second novel called "The 
Physics of Sunset." It's about an architect in Berkeley. In the meantime, she's 
savoring the success of Katrinka. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so delighted people think this comic monster is funny. It makes me feel 
other people out there have my same sick sense of humor."

THE WRONG OF WRIGHT'S CLOSE AIDE 
</P>

<P>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One evening in 1973, when she was a 20-year-old college student still living 
with her parents, Pamela Small entered a discount import store in suburban 
Annandale, Va., to buy some furnishings for her first apartment. It was just 
before closing time. The manager, a freckle-faced 19-year-old she had never 
seen before, was the only person in the store. 
</P>
<P>
Small took $31 worth of purchases to the cash register, but discovered a flaw 
in the window blinds she had selected. The manager said he had more in the 
storeroom and suggested she come and pick out the ones she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
But once inside, he blocked the door and ordered her to lie face down on the 
floor. When she refused -- when, with growing panic, she tried to talk her way 
to freedom -- he grabbed a hammer and slammed it into her skull. She 
immediately lost consciousness but he continued pounding, exposing the skull in 
five places. Then he grabbed a steak knife, stabbed her five times in the left 
breast and shoulder near her heart, and slashed her repeatedly across the 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
Bundling her limp body into the car she had left parked out front, he drove 
around for a while, then left the vehicle in an alley behind the store, keys in 
the ignition. Then he went to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Thought I Was Dead' 
</P>
<P>
"He told the police he thought I was dead," remembers Small, who, to the 
astonishment of the doctors who later treated her, was not. Regaining 
consciousness about eight hours later, she managed to start the car and drive a 
mile to an all-night Exxon station, where an attendant, wide-eyed at the sight 
of the gory figure in the blood-soaked seat, summoned help. 
</P>
<P>
It took a general surgeon, a plastic surgeon, a neurosurgeon and a thoracic 
surgeon seven hours in the operating room to repair the damage. Her left lung 
had collapsed and her head was a mass of lacerations and exposed bone. She 
spent 24 hours in intensive care with a tube in her lung, five more days in the 
hospital, weeks convalescing at home with her own nurse and more than a year 
undergoing plastic surgery and hair transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Her assailant was arrested the following day, pleaded guilty to malicious 
wounding ("that he did . . . stab, cut and wound one Pamela Small with the 
intent to maim, disfigure, disable and kill") and was sentenced to 15 years 
(seven suspended) in the Virginia State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
But in what Fairfax County, Va., Commonwealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan 
remembers as "highly unusual" treatment, the assailant never did time in the 
penitentiary. Instead, he spent less than 27 months in the more civilized 
confines of the Fairfax County Jail. He then was paroled to a job as staff 
assistant in the congressional office of Rep. Jim Wright (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offered Him a Job 
</P>
<P>
Wright, in fact, had offered him a job even before he was sentenced, a fact 
pointed out repeatedly to the sentencing judge. Wright's daughter then was 
married to the assailant's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at age 35, that man, John Paul Mack, is executive director of the 
congressional Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. He is Wright's 
right-hand man and, since Wright became Speaker of the House, has been arguably 
the most powerful staff member on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
As a convicted felon, Mack is barred by law from voting or obtaining a security 
clearance. But as the Speaker's closest aide he helps enact the nation's laws. 
Salaried at roughly $89,500, he earns approximately as much as a federal 
district judge or the director of the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime Known by Many 
</P>
<P>
The crime in Mack's past -- if not the details of it -- is known to many on 
Capitol Hill. Two years ago, a number of anonymous letters calling attention to 
Mack's conviction circulated on the Hill, purportedly written by an indignant 
former law enforcement officer. The ultraconservative Liberty Lobby magazine 
published a sketchy article headlined "Mack the Knife." 
</P>
<P>
Most legislators, however, appear to accept his and Wright's word that Mack's 
was a single mistake committed under stress a long time ago, for which he paid 
his debt to society. "I have never tried to hide it," Mack said in a brief 
phone conversation in which he declined to be interviewed further for this 
article. "This has been public record for 16 years." 
</P>
<P>
While Mack has progressed without interruption to his position of influence, an 
apparent model of rehabilitation and an example of society's ability to 
forgive, what of his victim? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Victim 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetic surgery long ago erased most marks of the attack, but Small favors 
high-neck blouses to hide a faint horizontal scar on her neck and still has 
days "when I feel like nothing but a mass of scars." She has watched with 
mounting alarm and anger the growing power of the man who tried to kill her. 
Now an executive with the Washington office of a major corporation, she finds 
herself increasingly pushed by her job toward the receptions and committee 
rooms of Capitol Hill. She finds excuses not to go, having no wish to find 
herself suddenly face-to-face with the man she last saw in court. 
</P>
<P>
Though Mack said in a statement, "I will always regret deeply my actions that 
day," Small says she has never heard that from him, either directly or 
indirectly. She has received no restitution. 
</P>
<P>
"Rightly or wrongly," says House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Calif.), who 
describes himself as "very close" to Mack, "under our system of law John Mack 
owed his debt to society, not to this young woman." 
</P>
<P>
Small has never before talked about the attack for the record. She feels the 
system has rewarded her assailant and says that he was offered the post in 
Wright's office only because he needed a job for his parole. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no direction toward Congress," she says. "He never even went to 
college. But he's got a very powerful, very important job now and he wouldn't 
have it if he hadn't tried to kill me. I find that more than a little bizarre. 
And I can't believe the people of this country, if they knew about it, wouldn't 
think that's outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Though it has surfaced in Wright's current rash of problems on Capitol Hill, 
the story of the assault on Small encompasses a larger societal issue. It 
strikes to the heart of the much-debated issues of crime and punishment and 
rehabilitation and redemption that have roused increasing passions nationwide. 
And it comes at the end of a decade of multiplying state and federal 
legislation designed to guarantee rights and restitution to victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Small remains unconvinced by John Mack's clean record and steady rise 
within the corridors of government. She cannot shake her conviction -- 
reinforced by the detective who investigated her case -- that "people who do 
something like that once will do it again." 
</P>
<P>
To Wright and Mack, however, the story is rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 19, I made a terrible, tragic mistake," Mack said. "I regret it 
every day. I accepted the judgment of society then and I accept it now. I have 
to put that behind me. All I ask is that I be judged by what I've done since in 
terms of trustworthiness, loyalty to my country, my family and those who depend 
on me." 
</P>
<P>
He was married in 1979 to his second wife, Kim, who is an executive assistant 
and appointments secretary to Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.). They live with 
their two young sons in suburban Virginia. He golfs on those rare days when he 
is not spending 12 or 13 hours on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wright's Right-Hand Man 
</P>
<P>
He is Wright's major traffic cop in the House. Mack decides which legislation 
to put on the agenda and which to keep off, handling major responsibilities 
under considerable pressure. By almost all accounts, he is good at his job, 
dedicated and hard working, liked and respected by both Democrats and many 
Republicans normally at odds with the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few staffers that are treated as colleagues by the members," 
Coelho says. "John Mack is one we've grown to know and trust. He knows the 
legislative process and he's mastered it with long years and lots of effort. If 
you had to pick the top five staffers on the Hill in terms of competence, John 
would be on everybody's list." 
</P>
<P>
In the unlikely event Wright were to let him go, Coelho says, "members would be 
lined up to hire him." 
</P>
<P>
"This society believes in forgiveness," Coelho adds. Mack has not only paid his 
debt to society by his time in prison, he says, but "by working conscientiously 
since then to be a good husband and a good citizen. That's supposed to be what 
rehabilitation is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Wright declines to be interviewed for this story or to answer specific 
questions about any role in Mack's sentencing, imprisonment or parole. The 
letters he wrote on Mack's behalf, in accord with Virginia law, remain sealed 
from public view as part of the pre-sentencing report considered by the judge 
who presided in his case. But two years ago he told the Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram, "I have never regretted giving John an opportunity all these 
years. I don't suppose anybody is immune from mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
When you meet Pamela Small, if you know her story, the most remarkable thing 
about her is how unaffected by the attack she appears today. She has striking 
looks and the trim, athletic body of a dancer. She skis, swims and has an 
active social life. Associates describe her as "gutsy," "uppity" and "a breath 
of fresh air." An old boyfriend, still close, calls her "no less open or 
trusting than any other woman I know . . . maybe more so." 
</P>
<P>
Small shrugs off the descriptions. "You just can't live in fear," she says. "I 
decided long ago I wasn't going to let John Mack ruin the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
She never lost her impish sense of humor and remembers "all this joking and 
giggling" with doctors and nurses in the emergency room, even as they were 
putting her back together. 
</P>
<P>
"She was amazingly calm for someone who had been through what she had," recalls 
Dr. Eugene Stevenson, who was part of the surgical team that worked on her. "I 
remember being shocked at both the unusual brutality of the attack and the fact 
that she lived through it. . . . Any one of those hammer blows alone could have 
killed her." 
</P>
<P>
Today, few people who know her know about the attack. "It's not exactly 
something you brag about," she says. "I don't want people treating me 
differently because of what happened." 
</P>
<P>
For this article she agreed to tell her story only on condition that where she 
lives and whom she works for be left vague, that her parents' names and 
addresses not be given and that pictures not make her identifiable. She allowed 
her name to be used only because "reporters have been calling (she's since 
unlisted her phone) and it's on the public record. They'll find it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
She remains troubled by the many questions still unanswered nearly 16 years 
after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
There never has been, for example, any satisfactory explanation for why Mack 
attacked her. There was no evidence of drug use and none of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
During his sentencing hearing, Mack testified that he "just blew my cool for a 
second" under what his attorney portrayed as intense psychological pressure 
from 72-hour work weeks and a failing three-week-old marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Court-appointed psychiatrists judged him sane at the time of the crime, saying 
he clearly knew right from wrong and understood the gravity of his act. A 
psychiatrist who examined him almost a year after the attack said Mack still 
felt he had "reacted in a way in which any man would perhaps react under 
similar circumstances" of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Small says Mack never exhibited any agitation, uncertainty or impatience before 
he struck her: "If he had, I never would have gone to the storeroom with him. 
He just looked and acted like a clean-cut kid." 
</P>
<P>
"In a way," she says, "I wish he had acted crazy. Then I could at least 
understand it. . . . I kept asking him (during the attack), 'Why are you doing 
this? You can't be serious.' And he just kept looking at me and put his fingers 
to his lips and said calmly 'Shhh! Shhhhh! Be quiet!' I can see that face and 
those eyes now. He was totally in control. He knew exactly what he was doing."

FORGOTTEN REBEL; 
</P>
<P>
RALPH JOHNS' STUBBORN CRUSADE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS COST HIM DEARLY, BUT DOES ANYONE 
REMEMBER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 30 years ago, Ralph Johns reached out and touched history. It was a 
fleeting caress but he cannot forget the texture of the moment when he -- a 
white merchant with a maverick streak wider than a freeway -- helped four young 
black men walk into a Woolworth store in Greensboro, N.C., and sit down at the 
whites-only lunch counter. 
</P>
<P>
Today, few know what Johns did in helping open a new front in the struggle for 
civil rights. Now in his later years, Johns -- who went broke, lost his first 
wife and was separated from his daughters for 13 years because he stood against 
the crowd -- often expresses bitterness that the fame, glory, success and 
satisfaction that went to others in the movement have eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want somebody to say, 'Hey, Ralph, thanks a hell of a lot for what 
you've done,' " he said the other day as he thumbed through his carefully 
tended scrapbooks, archives of an impulsive, episodic, improbable life. 
</P>
<P>
Johns, 73, a former bit actor who came to Southern California after his 
Greensboro business failed, also worries that his unforgettable moment will be 
forgotten, that his modest bid for immortality will be trumped by collective 
amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
"Seldom do people get up and say Ralph Johns was a stalwart in the civil-rights 
movement," said John Kilimanjaro, editor and publisher of the Carolina 
Peacemaker, a black weekly newspaper in Greensboro. "I personally don't feel 
he's been fully appreciated," Kilimanjaro added in a telephone interview. 
"Ralph is an individual who has paid his dues in full -- and the dues of a 
hundred others." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Simkins, president of the Greensboro chapter of the NAACP for 25 
years, said flatly, "He was the sit-in. There's no question about it, it was 
his idea." 
</P>
<P>
On another plane, Johns is remembered for befriending a young couple in 
Greensboro who would go on to bigger things. "I'm so glad he was there," said 
Jacqueline Jackson, wife of former Democratic presidential candidate Jesse 
Jackson. "He is just a wonderful and special human being to many people, 
especially our family." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Affable Air 
</P>
<P>
A jowly man who wears big-framed glasses, Johns lives with his wife of five 
years, Norma, in a trailer park in the Los Angeles sprawl, surrounded by scores 
of other neat double-wide mobile homes and not far from the park's ample 
clubhouse and swimming pool. It is an unlikely home for a social rebel, yet 
Johns seems to fit. He has a settled, country-club air, thanks to an affable, 
assured manner and clothes that smack of the golf course. (In fact, he says he 
was once banned from Greensboro's golf courses for trying to integrate them.) 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there anything to telegraph immediately that Johns, who has worked for 
the last 17 years as associate publisher of a Beverly Hills weekly, is such a 
complicated, contradictory mix of selflessness, generosity, idealism, religious 
faith, emotional vulnerability, self-indulgence and ego. Or that he has led 
such an impulsive, colorful, star-crossed life. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures on the wall of the living room and the voluminous scrapbooks 
quickly change first impressions, however. Pride of place is given to a large 
framed photo of Johns and a group of Greensboro's black leaders with the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr., around the time of the sit-ins. The scrapbooks contain 
clippings from local newspapers, letters and hundreds of photos dating back to 
Johns' early youth. But Johns doesn't need the yellowing scraps of paper to 
prompt his memory of that day when actions became so much louder than words. He 
is accustomed to delving into the past, of reliving the moments that in 
retrospect are saturated with might-have-beens. 
</P>
<P>
When the four young men stopped by his store on the afternoon of Feb. 1, 1960, 
and told him they were going to Woolworth's, Johns was surprised, he said. He 
had been proselytizing students from North Carolina Agricultural &amp; 
Technical College and others about staging a sit-in for about 10 years. There 
had never been any takers and then, suddenly, he had the recruits he had sought 
for so long. To protect his identity -- and perhaps as a dramatic flourish -- 
Johns assigned everybody numbers, a primitive code for emergency phone calls. 
Johns was No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I said whatever you do, if anything happens, call me on the phone but don't 
call me by my name because I've had a lot of threats, bomb threats and beatings 
and everything else and my wife's about ready to break a 20-year marriage," 
Johns remembers. " . . . Now listen, I'm Number 1. If anything happens call me 
up. And it was close to 5 o'clock. The manager (of Woolworth's) tried to get 
them out and they refused. So Ezell Blair, who was No. 2 -- his father was a 
teacher in Greensboro -- called me and I said what's happening and he said 
they're trying to throw us out. I called up the newspaper and a photographer 
got the picture (of the four men at the counter)." 
</P>
<P>
Most accounts of the American civil-rights struggle cover the Greensboro 
sit-ins. Often they list the names of the four North Carolina Agricultural 
&amp; Technical students -- Ezell Blair Jr., Franklin McCain, Joseph McNeil and 
David Richmond -- who discovered a fresh rallying point for the movement. The 
Greensboro protest rapidly became the impetus for many other such actions in 
the weeks and years ahead. (Sit-ins had been used previously in other states 
but somehow the chemistry was right in Greensboro.) Yet apparently only one 
book, long out of print, mentions Ralph Johns. 
</P>
<P>
Johns' obscurity seems to stem from a number of factors. Perhaps most 
important, he chose to remain in the background at the time of the sit-ins, 
fearing that his involvement would endanger his family. It was an unusual move 
for Johns, who started seeking publicity early in life, gaining a name for 
himself in the 1930s as the kid who crashed big-time prize fights, getting his 
smiling, truant mug in the newspapers standing boldly in the ring as a new 
champion was crowned. 
</P>
<P>
And Johns, a hefty former football player, was a tempting target three decades 
ago in Greensboro -- a man with the gall to fight bigotry by putting signs such 
as "Special This Week: Love Thy Neighbor" and "God Hates Segregation" in front 
of his store. He also wrote a column for the local black newspaper, the 
Champion, trumpeting his ideas about equal rights. He had come to the South and 
met and married a local woman after being discharged from the Army in 
Greensboro. His wife's family helped set him up in business there. But he seems 
never to have fit in with the norms and mores of the Carolina textile mill 
town. 
</P>
<P>
By his count, Johns received 27 bomb threats over the years in Greensboro. He 
was beaten, his store window defaced with racist slogans and he and his family 
socially ostracized, he said, remembering the pain one year when his two 
daughters were not invited to a neighborhood Christmas party. 
</P>
<P>
In both the black and white communities of Greensboro, the outspoken, exotic 
Johns, born of Syrian immigrant parents in New Castle, Pa., was a pariah, 
according to Miles Wolff, author of "How It All Began: The Greensboro Sit-Ins," 
a master's thesis that became a book published in 1970. Some skeptics said that 
Johns supported civil rights because it was good for his business, which 
catered largely to black customers. 
</P>
<P>
By 1960, Johns -- the Northern outsider -- had little influence even among 
Greensboro's civil-rights activists, said Wolff, who now owns the minor-league 
baseball team the Durham Bulls, inspiration for the successful movie, "Bull 
Durham," and publishes Baseball America, a sports trade paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody listened to Ralph," Wolff said. "The only people who did were four 
freshmen who didn't know any better. . . . Ralph in a sense is crazy. He's got 
his own drummer and he's going to do something different. In the '50s he was 
probably the only white man in Greensboro fighting segregation." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff, who happened on the white gadfly by accident as he scouted Greensboro 
for sources on the sit-ins, said that the protest swiftly grew beyond the 
control of its creators. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, he added, the failure of the Woolworth manager to have the four 
students arrested sent the five conspirators into near panic. Blair's phone 
call to Johns was a plea for help -- "What do we do, we're not getting 
arrested?" Wolff explained. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Johns' contribution to civil rights and the turbulent decade 
that was beginning was both trivial and cosmic, Wolff believes. "All Ralph did 
was give these kids the idea, he didn't really do anything," he said, noting 
that the protest went on for months and was dominated by black students. "After 
Feb. 2, 1960, he had no more role," Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
But Wolff also said that the sit-in was one of the first events to show the 
power of student activism. "All of a sudden it proved students could change 
things," he said, adding that the sit-in may have helped make possible "the 
whole student activism of the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Johns had the insight to pick one of segregation's soft spots, 
Wolf said. "His seeing that Woolworth's was vulnerable was crucial." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff, who seems to appreciate the comic aspects of the potentially explosive 
situation, said that plainly no one involved had any idea that the sit-in would 
be copied on such a wide scale. Johns "didn't know what he was starting," he 
said. "He believed in his heart that segregation was wrong and, gosh, something 
ought to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when Johns discusses the events leading up to the protest, he seems to 
have been motivated partly out of a violated sense of business ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year from 1950, I used to ask the students who came in my store if they 
had any guts and they'd say what do you mean?" Johns recounted. "Well I says, 
at the Woolworth 5- and 10-cent store and at Kress (another retailer) you can 
walk in and buy pencils at one counter, you can buy all kinds of items at other 
counters but right across, five feet away, there's a lunch counter you can't 
sit down and buy yourself something to eat. You have to buy (at the takeout 
window) but walk out. You can't eat there, you're not allowed to sit down and 
eat. And I says this is supposed to be a public place, it's not a private club. 
They're taking your money at all the counters but you can't go to the lunch 
counter like a decent citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Johns' strategy, if that's what it was, was simple. 
</P>
<P>
". . .This student came in my store by the name of Joe McNeil and I asked him 
the same question and he says what do you mean?" Johns said, savoring the 
memory. "And I says, well can you get me a few students to go up to 
Woolworth's. I'll give you the money and you go to different counters and buy 
items but make sure you get a receipt and go to the lunch counter. And when you 
go sit down they'll tell you I'm sorry but we don't wait on colored or Negroes. 
Then you call her a liar and say you do wait on us because here's the receipt 
to prove it. You just waited on us five feet from here." 
</P>
<P>
A month or so later McNeil came back with three friends, and four naive 
students and a nonconformist retailer ended up setting their corner of the 
world on fire. Within days sit-ins began in other cities and states as 
civil-rights organizations seized the tactic both as symbol and tool in the 
assault on segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, for Ralph Johns there was no glory, only another round of failure. 
In a twist of fate, Johns was forced to go out of business by the late 1960s, 
largely because his customers drifted to other, bigger stores that had been 
integrated, lunch counters and all. 
</P>
<P>
He lived in a rented room, his wife having left him, taking their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good marriage," Johns said. "She was a good woman but she was a 
segregationist and she didn't want to get involved anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Johns, who moved to Los Angeles in 1970 and had heart bypass surgery three 
years ago, still keeps in touch with his friends in Greensboro. And they seem 
to remember him with a mixture of fondness, humor and regret that things did 
not turn out better for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He lost so much," Kilimanjaro said. "His children wouldn't speak to him for 
years and his wife left him and they were Roman Catholic. . . . He was inclined 
to give you the shirt off his back. If he had $2, he would give you one. . . . 
My psychiatrist would say he suffers from a guilt complex." 
</P>
<P>
Johns also was a sucker for students, Kilimanjaro said, noting that his friend 
often made them loans and gave them clothes. Much was never paid back, he 
added. Johns himself estimates that he was carrying more than $700,000 in bad 
debts on his books when he went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
But Johns was not a man entirely wrapped up in charity and self-denial, 
Kilimanjaro cautioned. "If Ralph had $5, he would go down and get a massage. He 
might not have anything to eat but he would go down and get a massage. In those 
days, you could get a massage for $5 at the YMCA." 
</P>
<P>
Johns himself seems aware that he fits no mold. "It's an unbelievable story but 
I have the scrapbooks to prove it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't see his motives as complicated or tinged with self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
"All I want now is that some day the world will shake off this hypocrisy and 
this hate," he said. ". . . We've got to come back to God, that's my thought 
now. I serve God in what little way I can. Christianity doesn't come from lip 
service, it comes from soul service." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his regrets and his tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve, Johns 
said, "I can't be vindictive. No matter what, I ask myself would I do this 
again? I'm afraid so."

<P>
FLATS FEATURED IN FABRICS, PATENT LEATHER AND METALLICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
American women are in the midst of a flats attack. Just ask Libby Edelman, 
designer and co-owner of Sam &amp; Libby shoes in Northern California, who 
accords top billing to her company's leather ballerina slipper. 
</P>
<P>
At Nina in New York, fashion director Flori Silverstein likens her firm's big 
hit, a wedge-heel, patent-leather skimmer (2 million pairs sold in two years), 
to a classic T-shirt. And Miriam Sirota, the trendy co-owner of Privilege shoe 
stores in Los Angeles, insists "flats have become a basic." 
</P>
<P>
She's seen the most avid high-heel wearers make the switch this spring, 
inspired perhaps by Sirota's firm belief: "Flats don't mean unflattering." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they don't mean expensive either. This year the hot contender is 
expressive, fabric footwear that retails for $50 or less. 
</P>
<P>
Sirota says she and partner Thierry Coulon carefully chose three cloth designs 
from Europe, all priced around $50, to sell along with much more expensive 
merchandise. While she thinks of them as "fun, one-season throwaway shoes," she 
says they don't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on how much a woman wears them. If she buys one pair to go with 
three or four outfits and wears them once a week, they can last longer." 
</P>
<P>
Details such as a slight, wedge-heel on a pair of fuchsia, purple and black 
Shantung ballerina slippers at Privilege "make it just a little bit easier to 
walk in than a flat flat," Sirota notes. "They sell well because they give the 
comfort and allure of a flat, but they give you height as well." 
</P>
<P>
Measuring in at 5-foot-1, Sirota scoffs at the notion that petite women need 
high heels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in flats every day. I'm short and it doesn't bother me even if I go 
somewhere where I'm the shortest person in the room." Describing her personal 
style as "very, very trendy," Sirota believes that some of today's fashions, 
"Bermuda shorts, miniskirts and long, wide pants are totally unfit for high 
heels." 
</P>
<P>
Nina's Silverstein has her own answers to why more and more women are getting 
into low-heel shoes: "Life is getting faster and we have to move faster." 
</P>
<P>
One of her company's most popular styles is a $39, go-anywhere mule (a slip-on 
shoe open at the toe and heel) that comes in bright-colored patent leather or 
metallics. It is considered to have longevity despite the price. 
</P>
<P>
"They need care," Silverstein says, suggesting that patent be wiped with a damp 
cloth. She says cloth designs, such as pastel and print-mix espadrilles, "can 
be spot-cleaned with a little soap and water and a toothbrush, but the joy of 
most fabric shoes is not to have to spend a lot of money for them and not to 
worry about them." 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein's tricks for fabric footwear include adding an emblem or an 
inexpensive Chanel-look pin where you might expect to see a bow. "Or you can 
paint them or change the ribbons. And if worst comes to worst, you can buy a 
little package of dye and dye them black." 
</P>
<P>
Fun and quality at a price are two reasons "fabric shoes are back," she says. 
"Who wants to spend $100 for polka-dot leather pumps when you can have polka 
dots for $35 and throw them out at the end of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
For designer Edelman, this year's challenge was "to get people out of last 
summer's sneakers. We thought they would be ready for a change." She designed 
canvas shoes in solids, stripes or dots and added a crest as well as a leather 
sole. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Navarro, shoe designer for Chinese Laundry, sees both stripes and 
European-inspired suede summer shoes, with slightly pointed toes and high 
vamps, as "wardrobe necessities." 
</P>
<P>
To get women's feet closer to the ground, designers such as Navarro are adding 
clever ornamentations to flats that suggest "the dressy look of high heels," 
she says.

SEATTLE REHEATS 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Seattle Opera has attracted considerable attention in recent years for 
thinking big and for thinking different. 
</P>
<P>
It was here that America saw its first futuristic "Ring des Nibelungen." Local 
audiences have long taken Janacek and Berg in stride. Just a few weeks ago, 
Speight Jenkins, the imaginative general director, mustered what may have been 
the first performance anywhere of Massenet's alternate version of "Werther" -- 
the quirky one in which the title role is assigned to a baritone. 
</P>
<P>
No company, however, can survive on novelty and adventure alone. Even Seattle 
cooks with water on occasion. This week it is cooking Puccini. 
</P>
<P>
"Madama Butterfly" has been packing the 3,000-seat Opera House for an 
unprecedented eight-performance run. The weepy audiences are happy. The 
box-office treasurer is happy. Nevertheless, one doesn't have to be a critical 
"Butterfly" collector to recognize certain basic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bradshaw conducts with a cool head and a brisk hand. He favors 
restraint even when approaching the greatest gushes of Italianate rhetoric. 
Although one can admire his taste, one must acknowledge that it does little 
here to further the cause of poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Cazan's staging scheme frequently bogs down in fussy bits of extraneous 
business. He comes up with interesting ideas -- some even look original -- but 
many are trivial pursuits that merely distort the expressive focus. 
</P>
<P>
Carey Wong's panoramic set -- borrowed from Eugene, Ore. -- turns the playing 
area into an obstacle course, and not a gainly one at that. A daunting flight 
of steps leads to a quaint little bridge that spans rocky chasms high above 
Cio-Cio-San's house. Getting to the center of the action is not easy for the 
participants, and it certainly can't be half the fun. 
</P>
<P>
The title role was once relatively easy to cast. Remember the golden days of 
Albanese and Kirsten, Roman and Steber, Tebaldi and Callas, Jurinac and De los 
Angeles, Stella and Price . . . ? Those days seem, alas, to be over. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Daniels -- the latest would-be heir to the ex-geisha's kimono, dagger 
and hum-along aria -- used to be an adorable soubrette. Now, with both her 
voice and body gaining some weight, she wants to be a spinto diva. 
</P>
<P>
The program magazine tells us that she is about to venture the suicidal 
stresses of La Gioconda, on location in Venice. It gives one pause. 
</P>
<P>
She sings Puccini with reasonable amplitude and verbal point. She is an 
intelligent, communicative artist. 
</P>
<P>
She minimizes the mincing rituals of mock-japonaiserie. She commands attention 
with simple devices of operatic pathos, deftly applied. 
</P>
<P>
However, it took her a long time to warm up on Wednesday. Her top tones, which 
used to be notable for their silvery sheen, emerged blunt and tough. She didn't 
even bother to reach for the optional D-flat in the entrance episode. Nor was 
she very generous when it came to caressing the line in moments of 
introspection. There was more shade here than light. 
</P>
<P>
Marcello Giordani -- her ardent, 26-year-old Pinkerton from Sicily -- 
introduced the contradiction of an amiable, robust persona and a slender, 
delicate tenor. His warm, brightly focused, lyric resources might be better 
suited to bel-canto than verismo, but his is obviously a major talent. Remember 
the name. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast included Gaetan Laperriere as a nondescript Sharpless, 
Kathryn Garber as a sweet little Suzuki, Steven Cole as a particularly busy, 
unusually sinister Goro and Ralph Wells as an oddly Chaplinesque Yamadori. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, Puccini triumphed against the odds. He always does, no matter how 
tepid the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle is using him, not incidentally, to help subsidize six ambitious 
performances of "Die Meistersinger" this August and six of Poulenc's "Dialogues 
des Carmelites" next January. It is a productive quid pro quo.

SHILKRET, COE APPOINTED TO PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past decade, Wayne Shilkret, performing-arts director of the Ambassador 
International Cultural Foundation, has been perceived as the chief impresarial 
rival of Los Angeles Philharmonic Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Shilkret, 55, has been named new general manager of Hollywood 
Bowl, succeeding the outgoing Robert Harth on July 1 as second in command at 
the Philharmonic, Fleischmann will be his boss. 
</P>
<P>
In naming Shilkret to the newly created position, Fleischman commented he was 
following the dictum, "If you can't beat 'em, have 'em join you." 
</P>
<P>
Harth's duties -- his title is general manager of the association -- will be 
split between Shilkret and NancyBell Coe, who has served as orchestra manager 
of the Philharmonic since the fall of 1986. She will assume Harth's title and 
responsibilities, except for Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann praised Coe's "meteoric" rise at the Philharmonic, since she joined 
the organization as administrator of the Philharmonic Institute in the summer 
of 1986. Coe, 40, a former New Yorker, was on the staff of the Spokane 
Symphony, 1978-86. 
</P>
<P>
Coe's promotion puts a woman in a top management position at the Philharmonic 
for the first time in three decades. In 1960, after 11 years as orchestra 
manager, Alice Taylor was succeeded by the late Jaye Rubanoff. In 1986, Coe 
succeeded Deborah Rutter as orchestra manager when Rutter became executive 
director of Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Shilkret's Bowl responsibilities will include "management, production and 
programming," according to Fleischmann. Asked what changes he might institute 
at the outdoor amphitheater, Shilkret replied, "During this first season, I'm 
just going to be looking around, seeing what may be needed." He acknowledged 
that his first priority is "the physical plant and its upgrading." 
</P>
<P>
Programming for the 1989 season is already in place, the two administrators 
said, with the 1990 season "partially planned." Shilkret's contract, at an 
undisclosed salary reportedly in six figures, is for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Pasadena, the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation has 
announced that David Hulme, vice president of the Foundation and second in 
command to Foundation Chairman Joseph W. Tkach, will assume Shilkret's duties 
as director of performing arts. Unlike Shilkret, Hulme is a member of the 
Worldwide Church of God, founder and sponsor of the Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Shilkret presented music and dance events at Ambassador, Pasadena Civic and 
Shrine Auditoriums for the past 13 years. Harth departs Sept. 1.

ADAMS DIDN'T MISS THE BOAT FOR 'GONDOLIERS'; 
</P>
<P>
DONALD ADAMS DIDN'T MISS THE BOAT FOR 'GONDOLIERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Gondoliers' used to be my favorite Gilbert and Sullivan opera," says 
Donald Adams, sharing a naughty secret from his extensive D'Oyly Carte past. 
"It was the only one I wasn't in. So when it played, I had the night off!" 
</P>
<P>
With that admission the bluff, the good-natured singer winks -- his round ruddy 
cheeks shining in a smile. After all, it's "The Gondoliers" that brings D'Oyly 
Carte's former principal bass to town: Saturday and Sunday he performs in Opera 
a la Carte's new production of the work at Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was it likely that the 60-year-old veteran of G&amp;S wars would switch to 
another career without packing that favorite "Gondoliers" role, Don Alhambra, 
into his portfolio. Never mind that Adams now travels the international circuit 
singing mostly buffo comprimario roles in grand opera, as opposed to his 
established specialty, operetta. 
</P>
<P>
"I rather welcome this chance," he says, leaning forward in a club chair at the 
Opera a la Carte headquarters, St. James' Church in Pasadena. "It's a 
refreshing departure from what I've been up to." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most of the G&amp;S repertory he has done lately bears little 
resemblance to the Savoyard tradition of which he is an exponent. Last year, 
Adams sang his first Pooh-Bah in the Music Center Opera's "Mikado," a 
black-and-white tap-dancing cross between Noel Cowardian chic and Marx Brothers 
merriment. It banished all traces of customary japonaiserie. There was not a 
fan or kimono in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad Jonathan (Miller) did not ask me to sing my usual role, the Mikado," 
he says. "It was such a different concept. But I adored the whole marvelous 
thing. And playing Pooh-Bah -- as a bloated British bureaucrat -- was super. 
The name is even in the dictionary: 'jack-of-all-trades, master of none.' It 
was the first time the words ever made so much sense to me -- thanks to 
Jonathan. Especially helpful was his cue, to keep George Sanders in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Adams joined the revival cast last fall in London where, he says, the show was 
"an enormous hit." But, for him, it did not match the Music Center production 
"which gave me the chance to work with Dudley (Moore). He was divinely funny 
and a brilliant musician -- one of the best Ko-Kos I've ever stood onstage 
with." 
</P>
<P>
He also appeared in another famously updated "Mikado," the Peter Sellars 
production for the Chicago Lyric Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"That one was set in modern corporate Tokyo with the Mikado sitting on the roof 
of a red Datsun. It was a great success, but it so offended an audience member 
that he hollered 'rubbish' and stormed out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strange thing. Although I respect the purists, I'm always sorry when 
they can't appreciate the marvelous imagination at work. It seems they want 
things to stay as they remembered them." 
</P>
<P>
Where the directorial revolution is concerned, Adams sees little difference 
between G&amp;S and grand opera. Two weeks ago, for instance, he was singing 
Dr. Bartolo in Amsterdam for a "Barbiere" directed by the controversial Italian 
playwright Dario Fo. 
</P>
<P>
"He took the opera back to its buffo beginnings," says Adams. "There were mimes 
all over the place. The majority adored it, but not the purists." 
</P>
<P>
Always ready to jump into a joke, the singer mentions that he and Fo could pass 
for twins. "But he's a little older," Adams says with a laugh. "He's 23." Part 
of the good humor, he says, is natural. But much of it comes from "the sheer 
happiness of doing what I do." 
</P>
<P>
His horizons even go beyond comedy now -- and include the disagreeable Dikoy in 
Janacek's "Katya Kabanova" and the bank manager in Berg's "Lulu," for which he 
had as director Yuri Lyubimov. Next comes a major role -- Baron Ochs 
("Rosenkavalier"), which he is learning for the Welsh National Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you believe that I started out to be a straight actor?" asks the 
high-spirited Adams. "Luckily, I'm getting to retrace my steps, thanks to 
Matthew Epstein (a New York agent for opera singers). When he was a boy of 13 
he became my Trilby. Now we've come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
"The same goes for my marriage (to Muriel Harding, former principal soprano at 
D'Oyly Carte). We used to tour together in the beginning and now, once again, 
she's goes everywhere with me. Just call us Darby and Joan. Here we are in the 
autumn of our years having this wonderful fling."

HOME TECH: WILL MICHAEL JACKSON WEAR A TRIPLE CROWN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Michael Jackson already has made the two biggest-selling long-form music 
videos: this year's "Moonwalker" (CMV) and the 1983 release, "The Making of 
Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' " (Vestron). 
</P>
<P>
Soon he may have the top three. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jackson . . . The Legend Continues" (Vestron, $15.98) is due out 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike "Moonwalker," a series of music videos from Jackson's "Bad" album 
loosely arranged around a plot, this one is a documentary, narrated by James 
Earl Jones. Using mostly TV clips and interviews, it shows Jackson's steady 
growth into the biggest pop-music star of the '80s. There's extensive footage 
of the Jackson 5's early '70s TV guest shots. 
</P>
<P>
This may sound familiar to Showtime cable subscribers. The 60-minute program 
was originally produced for Showtime and aired last year. Jackson and Suzanne 
de Passe, of Motown Productions, were the executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
Vestron was anxious to get the rights to this tape because of the explosion in 
the music video market since early in the year, triggered by "Moonwalker," the 
best-selling video ever (750,000 units). Bruce Springsteen's "Video Anthology" 
(350,000 units) and U2's "Rattle and Hum" (375,000) have reinforced the notion 
that long-form music videos -- especially those featuring superstar acts -- can 
be big sellers. 
</P>
<P>
What's happened is a shift in marketing techniques. Video retailers, whose 
primary business is renting major movies, are not the major focus for long-form 
music video sales any longer. 
</P>
<P>
To market these titles, video companies are turning to mass merchants such as K 
mart and Target, now a major source of home-video sales. Even more important, 
the distributors have learned to market their music-videos in record stores, 
taking the product directly to the music fans who are the primary audience for 
these titles. 
</P>
<P>
The new Jackson video promises to be a sales blockbuster too. Vestron Video 
President Jon Peisinger said the company will initially ship between 400,000 
and 500,000 copies. The plan is to market it everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't just be in video stores," Peisinger said. "It will be in record 
stores, supermarkets, mass merchants, drugstores, you name it. At this low 
price, we're aiming at the impulse buyer."

Actor Don Johnson (of "Miami Vice") is facing a Vermont income tax bill of more 
than $50,000. The state Senate's Finance Committee this week killed a provision 
of a new tax law that would exempt entertainers from state income tax, 
retroactive to Jan. 1, 1986. The committee initially approved the exemption, 
but 24 hours and dozens of telephone calls from angry constituents later, the 
panel reversed itself. The state billed Johnson for money he earned in Vermont 
while making the 1987 film "Sweetheart's Dance." In a lengthy statement issued 
Thursday by his press agent, Johnson said he regretted that the issue had been 
"personalized" to focus on him rather than the policy implications of the tax.

A spokeswoman for ABC says the network is "disappointed and dismayed" that 
members of the National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians have 
"overwhelmingly" rejected what ABC says is its final contract offer. Twelve of 
18 NABET units turned it down. Among the units voting to accept it were NABET 
news-writers, hair stylists and transcriptionists at ABC facilities here. ABC 
wants to meet with union officials "as soon as possible to make sure the 
leadership and its members understand that the terms of our final offer will 
not be renegotiated." NABET's contract expired March 31, but has been extended 
on a day-to-day basis. ALEENE MacMINN

Tom Dixon, the veteran classical music announcer who worked for KFAC for 40 
years, will be back on the air this summer. He has been signed to host a 
seven-night-a-week 6-10 p.m. program on KKGO-AM (540, stereo) which is targeted 
to switch to a classical music station in July. Dixon's program will include an 
8-10 p.m. "Evening Concert," which was a KFAC staple for many years. Exact date 
for the start of the classical music format is yet to be set, awaiting 
installation of new equipment, including a 25,000-watt AM transmitter. KKGO-FM 
(105.1) will continue with a jazz format. ALEENE MacMINN

'LOST ANGELS' FALLS INTO MELODRAMATIC ABYSS

<TEXT>
<P>
You've seen the soothing ads on television: If your teen-ager has a drug or a 
drinking problem, this shady-acred estate with its licensed staff is just the 
place to have your troubles taken off your hands. The backdrop for the 
overheated "Lost Angels" (citywide) is one of these private psychiatric 
facilities that specialize in treating affluent kids who have taken a bad turn. 
</P>
<P>
As he begins his story of Valley boy Tim Doolan (Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz), 
who has good reason to feel unwanted since his parents' divorce, director Hugh 
Hudson walks a tightrope between a fascinating demonstration of the inner 
workings of such places, and the increasing melodrama of Michael Weller's 
screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
By the film's end, the tightrope is gone, Hudson -- and we -- are wallowing in 
fevered, nightmarish stagings, camera movements from hell and a loss of all 
common sense. It's in moments like this that you remember that Hudson is not 
only the director of "Chariots of Fire," but he was also the director of 
"Revolution," and it's that movie's jaw-dropping silliness that he is up to 
here. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pity, because both Horovitz, in a nicely played debut performance, and, 
especially, Donald Sutherland, as Tim's white-bearded, compassionate 
psychiatrist, are fine. 
</P>
<P>
Tim has been put in the insurance-funded facility, where Sutherland's Dr. 
Charles Loftis works, primarily because Tim's newly remarried mother doesn't 
want his wild behavior to complicate her life. But Loftis is not without 
complications himself. His wife seems tired of heading a family that plays 
second fiddle to any one of his cases, and Loftis' escape for some years has 
been alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conclusion is the purest nonsense, the growing scenes of trust 
between Tim and Loftis are nicely drawn, as are many of the school sequences. 
But it's never a good sign when a writer resorts to first-person narration to 
tell us feelings and reactions that would be better left unsaid, or performed. 
Then with the subplot about Tim's influential, older stepbrother Andy (Don 
Bloomfield) and the gang both boys belong to -- the DABs, white Valley kids who 
hate but emulate black and Chicano gangs -- Hudson begins to hyperventilate 
cinematically. He is helped, unfortunately, by the excesses of the usually 
poetic cinematographer Juan Ruiz-Anchia. 
</P>
<P>
Comfortably well-off but neglected kids have been the fodder for films from the 
hypnotic ("On the Edge" and "Suburbia"), to the vacuous ("Less Than Zero"). 
It's not hard to see why: These casts absorb dozens of the seemingly endless 
supply of shiny-faced teen-age actors who flood both coasts, and the roles have 
sure-fire empathy with their peers who buy the tickets. (This one, however, is 
MPAA rated R for language and sex.) 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these lost angels are an uneven assortment. As Cheryl, the 
pivotal mixed-up siren, 17-year-old Amy Locane, who comes from television, 
seems to have been taught that every word needs a change of expression. Every 
single word. It makes her time on screen exhausting. 
</P>
<P>
Almost worse is Bloomfield as Tim's loco brother, who seems to have patterned 
his performance after Willem Dafoe's in "Streets of Fire." It's too bad that 
these and other excesses of style whittle away at the affection audiences would 
otherwise have for these tormented kids. SHEILA BENSON

'SIGNS OF LIFE' FALLS SHORT OF A WONDERFUL IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Signs of Life" (AMC Century 14), set in a small coastal Maine village, is 
deliberately shot with a jewel-like clarity that suggests the paintings of 
Andrew Wyeth: window curtains billowing in the morning breeze, hills and 
coastline icily distinct. Director John David Coles and cinematographer Elliot 
Davis turn the town into an objet d'art: precious, irreplaceable. But they also 
may want to suggest that sad clarity we get in the moments when something is 
irrevocably passing, leaving us forever. 
</P>
<P>
The movie takes place on the last day of a local shipyard that has been 
defeated by modernity and fiberglass. The last boat is about to be launched; 
the boss (Arthur Kennedy) and his housekeeper (Kate Reid) muddle through the 
dust and detritus of decades; the foreman (Beau Bridges) awaits the birth of 
his fifth child while despondently mulling over chances of new employment; the 
two younger workers (Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio and Kevin J. O'Connor) are about 
to pull up stakes, to leave their loved ones -- a retarded younger brother 
(Michael Lewis) and a girlfriend (Mary Louise Parker) -- and head for Florida 
and an absurd dream of finding buried treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Mark Malone symbolically compresses the day's events, which include a 
birth, a marriage and (maybe) a death. And, while Kennedy's Owen Coughlin faces 
mortality, he is dogged by a beaming, spectral young man: the image of his 
long-dead father. 
</P>
<P>
"Signs of Life" tries to portray a part of America most recent movies ignore: 
the old, the nonvictorious. But when Bridges' foreman robs a store, he is the 
dispossessed outlaw: The wind blows the bills off his chest, like the gold dust 
in "Treasure of Sierra Madre." And when D'Onofrio's Daryl and O'Connor's Eddie 
hit the road, they are enacting a goofball parody of thousands of highway 
quests from "Easy Rider" to "Rain Man." 
</P>
<P>
"Signs of Life" sounds like a wonderful movie. But, instead, it's a wonderful 
idea. It has all the virtues we've come to expect of American Playhouse 
productions: artistic and social idealism, literacy, careful production, a 
sense of the landscape, fine acting -- especially by Reid, Lewis and Arthur 
Kennedy, a great American actor too long absent from the screen. But Malone, 
like Chris Gerolmo in "Miles from Home," comes from a more affluent milieu than 
his characters. He may unconsciously condescend to them -- at best, turn them 
into vessels of poeticized guilt, at worst, into a passel of rustic 
nincompoops. 
</P>
<P>
"Signs of Life" still has something precious to give us: those delicately 
etched, Wyethesque landscapes, the mood of melancholy community and generosity 
in the waning day, and Arthur Kennedy as Owen, raging, raging, against the 
dying of the light. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

'OUT OF THE DARK' DOESN'T STAND UP TO LIGHT OF DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Wilmington 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Out of the Dark" (citywide) has a surface like Day-Glo on chrome, even though 
its heart is pure slime. It's a tongue-in-cheek, slasher thriller about a 
psychotic killer in a clown outfit, slaughtering the women who work in a 
telephone sex service called "Suite Nothings." It reeks of low intentions and 
sleazy pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
Bobo, the movie's killer, looks like a cross between Bozo the Clown and The 
Joker of Batman comics. Bobo slays his victims in ways that are supposed to be 
surprising or droll: bopping them with baseball bats, strangling them with 
telephone cords or prowling around with a huge, serrated knife that practically 
screams phallic symbol. Since the cops -- including the late Divine -- suspect 
a hunky professional photographer (Cameron Dye), we also seem to be getting 
another Hitchcockian "wrong man" thriller, with another couple-on-the-run. 
</P>
<P>
Director Michael Schroeder and cinematographer Julio Macat are trying for some 
of the voluptuous, overheated stylishness of a Brian De Palma thriller. But if 
the film suggests De Palma, it's a De Palma who has forgotten how to create 
suspense. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is paralyzingly shallow; the only feeling you can detect behind it is 
the desire to make a movie. And though it's trying for a certain cold, nasty, 
hyper-stylized chic, the lines are so dumb and the acting so mannered or 
vacuous that the effect is like a clammy-handed massage. Even good actors like 
Karen Black, Bud Cort, Tracey Walter or Geoffrey Lewis are used as if they were 
big plastic cutouts of themselves. It's stultifying. Watching "Out of the Dark" 
is like staring at a strobe light while someone keeps screaming and dirty jokes 
are droned in your ear. 
</P>
<P>
The acting and writing -- which are, respectively, erratic and bad beyond 
belief -- suggest a porno movie, but when Schroeder shoots a sex scene, he does 
it in chi-chi fragments. Virtually every sequence is borrowed from something 
else: "Body Double" or "Dressed to Kill," "Stripped to Kill," "Jagged Edge" or 
"Psycho." When the film makers feel classy, they stage a scene with a faceless 
crowd and a street accident victim who seems lifted from Bunuel's "Un Chien 
Andalou"; as a camp touch, they throw in Tab Hunter as the man driving the car. 
That's what the whole movie is: clammy-handed camp. "Out of the Dark" (MPAA 
rated R for sex, violence and language) should probably be kept out of the 
light as well. Michael Wilmington

'LUCKIEST MAN': ALIVE WITH FINE ACTING, HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a born storyteller as sincere and inventive as Frank Gilroy and an actor's 
actor like Philip Bosco could get away with "The Luckiest Man in the World" 
(AMC Century 14), making its twist seem fresh, funny and poignant instead of a 
gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
This fine little film is roughly a reverse take on "It's a Wonderful Life." In 
the beloved Capra classic an angel shows a despairing James Stewart all the bad 
things that would have happened to his family and his friends had he never been 
born. In writer-director Gilroy's film almost everybody wishes apoplectic, 
ruthless New York garment manufacturer Sam Posner (Bosco) were dead. They 
almost get their wish; Sam barely misses a plane for Miami which crashes on 
takeoff, killing all aboard. Nudged by a sepulchral voice (Moses Gunn), Sam is 
confronted with what a monster he is and becomes eager to make amends. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge, of course, is in sustaining Sam's odyssey, which is where Gilroy 
and Bosco shine. (Bosco is best known to moviegoers as the financier in 
"Working Girl.") The responses of Sam's family, employees and colleagues are 
consistently imaginative, as full of humor as they are of pain, and Bosco is as 
convincing as the newly warm Sam as he is as the cold jerk of the past. Some 
encounters are a little more persuasive than others, and there are a few 
moments of hesitancy on Gilroy's part as to how to wrap everything up. However, 
it's quite easy to be beguiled by this wise and rueful fable. 
</P>
<P>
This is a very New York film, with its emphasis on characterization rather than 
style, with its cast composed of actors rather than movie stars. The wonderful 
Bosco, stocky, open-faced and expansive, is well supported by Doris Belack as 
his understandably cynical wife; Joanne Camp as his perplexed mistress; Matthew 
Gottlieb as his confounded transvestite son and Yamil Borges as the beautiful 
young widow of the man who took Sam's plane seat on standby. They and many 
others, including Joel Friedman as Sam's paralyzed ex-business partner, are a 
constant pleasure. "The Luckiest Man in the World" is the kind of film that 
many people would enjoy; it has more substance than chic, and its sensibility 
and perspective are comfortably middle-aged. Gilroy still remains best-known 
for his 1964 Pulitzer prize-winning play "The Subject Is Roses" and for its 
1968 adaptation to the screen. He also wrote and directed such satisfying and 
intimate films as "Desperate Characters," "From Noon Till Three," "Once in 
Paris" and "The Gig." KEVIN THOMAS

<TEXT>
<P>
We know Dennis Hopper as the actor who portrayed the carousing biker in "Easy 
Rider." Hopper admits there is a bit of himself in the self-destructive types 
he portrays. Through battles with alcohol and drugs, Hopper has come through as 
an incisive creative force. A body of his black-and-white photographs executed 
mostly in the '60s bears this out. 
</P>
<P>
Hopper's personal foibles apparently lent him a penetrating and witty view into 
the core of the era. His long relationship with movies gives the photos a 
compositional sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
Hindsight perspective on the hedonistic '60s proves Hopper's images 
artistically prophetic. Looking like a maniacal Dr. Frankenstein, Ed Keinholz 
considers a mannequin head for use as art. Hanging from the rafters, Robert 
Irwin installs a work and we wait for the light bulb he holds in his mouth to 
spontaneously combust. Several shots of a young Andy Warhol in his pre-fame, 
pre-bleached wig days capture the innocence and decadence that wrought those 
magical times. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s Hopper was part of the Ferus circle of artists that included George 
Herms, so it's appropriate that the gallery has a tandem show of West Coast 
junk sculpture by the granddad of the genre, George Herms. 
</P>
<P>
Poet, writer, film maker, printer and pioneer of the California happening (his 
first was staged to finance the repair of his roof), Herms is -- right down to 
the "LOVE" slogan that appears on nearly every work -- quintessential '60s. 
Perhaps more than his retrospective at the Newport Harbor Art Museum in 1979 
which was weighted toward early work, this little show demonstrates what Herms 
has been up to lately. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the rusted motorcycles, antique diving apparatus, old lamps, pitted 
household appliances, creaking clocks set behind fogged and weathered glass, 
there is an unusual elegance to this show. The scrapbook quality of earlier 
works is replaced by a more formal, self-contained grace. 
</P>
<P>
Works are made of wonderfully illogical combinations of rusted metal debris -- 
like a saw blade with decorative metal tendrils pressed against it, or two open 
doors of a discarded van embellished with metal filigree and presented almost 
like screens or painted panels. That's not to say Hermes has given up his sense 
of humor. It's abundant in pieces like "Solar Powered Herms' Light (Paint Box 
Pioneer)," a strange collision between a wood knob, an upturned lamp and a 
coiled crown of candle holders. Another playful concoction of aged debris that 
whispers what could be the Herms' second-favorite slogan "GET REAL ART SNOBS." 
If all the post-modern stuff we're seeing is haute cuisine, Hermes is 
hand-ground wheat bread and it's tasty. (L.A. Louver, 77 Market Street, both 
shows through May 20). MARLENA DONOHUE

Santa Barbara artist Ron Robertson shows assemblage chocked with dizzying 
references to the lost continent Atlantis, the Bible, classical myths and 
medieval lore, not to mention a few of the soap-opera legends that have 
replaced myth for contemporary man. All the info is unified by constant 
allusions to political and military power and that age-old force that Marcel 
Duchamp said fuels the world, Eros. 
</P>
<P>
Most assemblage artists appropriate junk; Robertson prefers to create objects, 
toys, stone and metal fragments that ape the look of wear and tear. "View From 
Atlantis" looks like a rusted submarine porthole set in a frame and through 
which we see a sea of old rings, oxidized gears and whatnots. In another work, 
a metal creature claws on a nude, overripe madonna. Her questionable chastity 
is questionably guarded by soldiers and all sorts of artillery. Right next 
door, a little toy couple relax numbly in their upper-middle-class pool. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost too easy for Robertson to make all these Barbie dolls, classical 
reliefs and war toys; he can free associate and tinker himself into real hokey 
ground. But his theme -- that we're an innately bellicose bunch soothing 
ourselves with illusions of romantic love -- is provocative. (Heritage Gallery, 
718 N. La Cienega Blvd. through May 20.) Marlena Donohue

When Gillian Theobald draws twin, abstract tree trunks on two sheets of paper, 
the images play conceptual games about seeing and perception. Skin-smooth tree 
trunks float on the page, solid from the ground up, sensuously rounded with 
thick limbs that recall the human body. As the image shifts from left to right, 
the ground goes from light to dark and the image flips front to back. Rendered 
in charcoal, the black-on-black drawing is a hard-to-see, image of intriguing 
subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of this exhibit is devoted to a "Diary Project" begun in 1982. 
It's a series of 309 self-portrait drawings. Many were done without a mirror. 
Small liberties with what is observable -- like orange flames that ignite the 
face -- describe the artist's state of mind. The drawings have the feel of Zen 
exercises that encourage repetitive small rituals to achieve a new 
consciousness. They have a plodding, systematic sensibility. Taken together 
they are strangely static, even when dipping into the potent realm of 
psychological balance. Most often the face is vacant and the drawing 
graphically direct. It's only in the context of the whole that a tentative 
sense of the artist can be felt. That may be intended to raise questions about 
art's ability to actually represent reality, but the formula seems slanted to 
arrive at a negative conclusion. (Cirrus, 542 S. Alameda St., to June 24.)

Patricia Turnier makes paints smoky, atmospheric images. Done in modulated 
egg-shell whites and neutral tones heightened to the fluffiness of storm 
clouds, the works are so loose they could be images of vapor or simply abstract 
fields. There's a nostalgic, romantic bent here that remains sweet and 
dangerously tame. 
</P>
<P>
Three small works collectively called "Coastal Ranges" are kept nocturnal and 
moody. Crisp edging contributes a plastic and psychic tension otherwise 
missing. Turnier begins to tap that ferocious sublimity that raises this sort 
of work above Sunday realism. 
</P>
<P>
Like a jolt, we move into a show of hot, red, apocalyptic abstractions by Clark 
Walding. Formerly a figurative artist, Walding has retained his vigorous 
gestural approach to pigment, making molten surfaces and incorporating passages 
of charred wood. In "One Inside the Hall," a tiered structure embedded in an 
expanse of gnarled paint suggests a ladder or shelter offering a frail handhold 
in the maelstrom of a churning void. If Turnier's work lacks bite, then 
Walding's -- much like Robert Morris' last fiery works on similar themes -- 
suffers from a bit of histrionic excess. (The Works Gallery, 106 W. 3rd St., to

'JAZZ ALIVE' ON BRAVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Jazz Alive," airing tonight on the Bravo cable channel at 7 and midnight, was 
taped in 1983 in Toronto, with an assortment of Canadian and American 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard Ferguson, who opens the show with two numbers backed by the Canadian 
house band self-consciously reading its parts, plays high, wide and not very 
handsome. A bravura expert, he has rarely shown much class as an improvising 
musician and seems even less inspired nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
Also past his prime was the great Teddy Wilson, a seminal pianist of the 1930s, 
seen here three years before his death, going rather sadly through the motions 
of what was once an excitingly fresh style. 
</P>
<P>
The late Woody Herman, too, is below optimum form as he takes the house band 
through two of his charts; but Moe Koffman, the principal sideman, redeems this 
segment with his alto sax and piccolo solos, as well as in his flute specialty 
on "Jitterbug Waltz." He has never quite received his just desserts outside 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Waving the Canadian flag even more proudly are the vibraphonist Peter 
Appleyard, whose blues solo digs deep into the roots, and a surprisingly 
compelling "Lush Life" sung by Cecile Furness. The latter, a tall and striking 
Afro-Canadian, assuredly deserves south-of-the-Northern-border exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the vocal honors, Mel Torme is his perennial indomitable self on a 
"Ridin' High/Shootin' High" medley followed by a blues, "Sent for You 
Yesterday," in which he trades ad libs with Koffman. 
</P>
<P>
The finale finds Torme on drums with the band as the entire cast gathers on 
stage for Woody Herman's "Apple Honey." Cecile Furness, in an attempt at 
scatting, seems a little out of her territory here. Over all, though, it's an 
amiable ending to a mildly satisfying convocation.

VLADIMIR ASHKENAZY AT CHANDLER PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At one time, 10 and more years ago, it seemed that Vladimir Ashkenazy visited 
here annually, playing solo recitals or with orchestra -- or both. Now, those 
visits appear to happen less frequently, and some of the time they bring the 
Russian-born musician here as conductor. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, then, that what seemed to be an overflow crowd filled the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion at the Music Center for Ashkenazy's latest recital Wednesday 
night. What that throng heard was proof once more that the compact 51-year-old 
pianist remains one of the handful of standard-setters of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
Again, his program probed serious scores deeply. Again, his comprehensive 
technical apparatus swept all before it. Again, his musical integrity delivered 
an Olympian perspective. 
</P>
<P>
This time, that perspective surveyed works of Brahms and Schumann. The Piano 
Pieces of Opus 119 and the mammoth, early, F-minor Sonata, Opus 5, surrounded 
Schumann's "Kreisleriana"; this was a heavy listen as well as a virtuosic 
handful. But it satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
In an era of musicological -- as well as biographical -- reconsideration, 
Ashkenazy, like many others, scrutinizes familiar works with renewed zeal. His 
performances here were predictable only in his sober penetration of the 
materials and his achievement of cohesive readings. 
</P>
<P>
His emotional aloofness -- no grandstanding or ego-gratification ever seems to 
mar his playing -- benefited both composers through a clear and unsurprising 
honesty of statement. 
</P>
<P>
No self-absorption materialized to keep the intricacies of Opus 119 from 
revealing the simple evidence of its text; no self-dramatization by the pianist 
stood in the way of Brahms' youthful and affecting sincerity. In the mysterious 
mood-changes of "Kreisleriana," Ashkenazy offered no pianistic editorial 
comments -- he merely let the work unfold. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, such careful and comprehensive treatment of these treasurable 
scores did not go unnoticed. The hard-listening audience applauded insistently, 
until Ashkenazy returned and played a single encore, Chopin's Nocturne in B, 
Opus 62, No. 1. Then they went home -- smiling.

BACKERS CHEERED, DEVASTATED BY VERDICT

Oliver L. North's ever-loyal supporters rallied to his side and belittled the 
jury's verdict after his conviction Thursday on charges arising from the 
Iran-Contra scandal. But Democratic lawmakers and others troubled by North's 
activities said the verdict proved that North had obstructed Congress and 
undermined the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Orange and Los Angeles counties' Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), a close 
North friend and ally, described the former Marine officer as "absolutely 
elated" by his acquittal on nine of the 12 charges he faced. 
</P>
<P>
"He was found guilty of cutting corners and found innocent of all criminal 
wrongdoing," contended Rohrabacher, a former White House speech writer for whom 
North campaigned extensively last year. "This has been a political trial since 
Day 1 and it's time for President Bush to end the sham and the circus and give 
Ollie North a pardon." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said he was "delighted" 
that North was found not guilty of the more serious counts brought in the 
indictment more than a year ago. Cox said that it was a "sad commentary" that 
all that resulted from the $12-million trial was conviction on charges that he 
said were equivalent to "the fire department (being convicted) for double 
parking at the scene of the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher and Cox tapped North's image as a hero of the conservative movement 
by having the retired Marine lieutenant colonel campaign for them in last 
year's Republican primary. North helped each to raise about $100,000 for their 
races in large fields of GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
But another friend called the felony conviction a "devastating" personal blow 
to North, who won the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts for service in the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a man of great personal pride and honor, who spent his entire life 
trying to live up to a set of standards, trying to serve his country 
faithfully," said Patrick Korten, a Justice Department spokesman during the 
Reagan Administration. "And now, to be convicted of a felony -- think of it, a 
soldier who served his country in war, who can no longer legally possess a 
firearm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment From Reagan 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, through a spokesman, declined to comment on the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) also minimized the 
severity of the verdict, saying that North had already admitted shredding 
documents to protect a covert operation and had accepted the gift of a home 
security system because his family was getting death threats at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he was the first to announce the verdict to a throng of reporters 
gathered on the steps of the U.S. Courthouse Thursday afternoon. A fervent 
North supporter, he said he didn't have a seat and was being escorted out of 
the courtroom as the jury announced its verdict. Dornan slipped out while Judge 
Gerhard A. Gessell kept reporters locked in the courtroom to prevent an 
unseemly scramble for the telephones and later rode down an escalator with 
North and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"He was obviously showing signs of great relief and so was Betsy," Dornan said. 
"It was a tremendous pressure lifted off their backs." 
</P>
<P>
Of the trial, itself, he said: "I think it is ludicrous to give amnesty to 
draft dodgers and rake over the coals a combat-tested Marine who was always 
operating, he thought, inside his chain of command. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers who conducted the hearings that made North a national icon, adored as 
a hero by millions of Americans and condemned as a misguided zealot by many 
others, said that the verdict vindicated their previous -- and highly 
contradictory -- opinions of the man and his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), chairman of the Senate select committee on 
the Iran-Contra scandal, said that the North verdict "reaffirms the conclusion" 
of the Senate and House investigating panels that "fundamental processes of 
governance were disregarded and the rule of law was subverted." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Iran-Contra committee said: 
"I don't feel any sense of elation. I don't feel any sense of disappointment. 
My feeling is that Col. North had a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Tragic' Figure 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), also a member of the Senate panel, called North 
a "tragic" figure but added: "He did some things which in America today you 
have to be held accountable for." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin K. Hatch (R-Utah) said: "If you look at it objectively, Oliver North 
has been largely vindicated. . . . The jury, because of all the hype on this 
thing, felt it had to come up with a conviction. They came up with a compromise 
verdict that was the least offensive verdict for Col. North." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), an ardent North supporter who was in the courtroom 
when the jury read the verdict, said that the former National Security Council 
aide was "very tranquil," despite the guilty verdicts on three counts. 
</P>
<P>
Others were left unsatisfied by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. McFarlane, North's former boss at the White House who has already 
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in the scandal, said: "We are no closer 
to solving the basic issues that led to Iran-Contra than we were two years ago. 
It will be very sad if five years from now our children and grandchildren look 
back at Iran-Contra as simply a criminal matter. It was a very serious breach 
of process."

<P>
WOMAN AT BUS STOP IS HIT BY RUNAWAY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 80-year-old woman waiting at a bus stop was critically injured Thursday 
afternoon when a car idling at a nearby service station slipped into reverse 
and hit her. 
</P>
<P>
The freak accident was reported at 3:32 p.m. in the 13800 block of Red Hill 
Avenue near El Camino Real. The victim, Aletta Streeter of Tustin, was taken to 
United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where she was listed in critical 
condition Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Driver Barbara Greeland, 45, of Santa Ana, had stopped at the Mobil service 
station on Red Hill and got out of her car to ask a question, Tustin police 
spokesman Bryan Meder said. She left her 1967 Mustang running, with the gear 
shift in park, Meder said. 
</P>
<P>
Meder said that the car slipped into reverse but that why it did so is not 
known. It moved backward at a slow speed, striking Streeter, who was sitting on 
a bus bench nearby. The runaway vehicle then entered Red Hill, colliding with a 
northbound Volvo. No injuries were reported in that accident.

SUSPECT IN SHOOTING OF RETIRED POLICE CAPTAIN IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police special weapons officers surrounded an Anaheim motel late Thursday night 
and arrested a suspect in last week's robbery and shooting of a retired Buena 
Park police captain. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest took place about 11 p.m., after Buena Park police officers obtained 
an arrest warrant for the attempted-murder suspect, whose name they would not 
give, in the April 25 robbery and shooting of retired Capt. Robert Coovert, 57. 
</P>
<P>
SWAT officers from Buena Park and Anaheim arrested the suspect, a young man, 
and his female companion as the pair stepped out of a room at the Ha'Penny Inn, 
which had been under surveillance for several hours Thursday evening. The two 
were arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephoned Room 
</P>
<P>
The suspect and his companion stepped out of the motel room after police gave 
instructions to the motel manager to telephone the room. The instructions given 
to the manager to relay to the room's occupants were not immediately disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:40 p.m., a police commander gave the first go-ahead to "take him (the 
suspect) down" as soon as he emerged from a room at the motel in the 2600 block 
of West Lincoln Avenue. Special weapons and tactics team officers were 
positioned in a room down the hallway from the suspect, as well as on all sides 
outside the room. Police officials had set up a special command post in the 
parking lot of the Victory Baptist Church of Orange County on Magnolia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Bridge's team will be taking him down once he's out of the apartment," the 
officer in charge of the operation told his men over two-way radios. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friend of Suspect 
</P>
<P>
But as officers were maneuvering into position, a man identified by police as a 
friend of the suspect was seen leaving his room next door and loitering 
outside, police were heard to say over their two-way radios. A commander 
frantically ordered his officers to "get rid" of the man as soon as possible so 
he could not try and alert the suspect. The unidentified man was subsequently 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 10:54 p.m., police gave the go-ahead for the manager to call the 
suspect's room. After he was placed under arrest, one officer radioed another: 
"Congratulations." 
</P>
<P>
Coovert, an 11-year veteran of the Buena Park Police Department, was shot in 
the head and chest in his Buena Park florist shop when he refused a robber's 
demand to hand over his money and his wife's purse, authorities have said. 
Coovert was listed in good condition Thursday at United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where he had been admitted in critical condition after the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Coovert, speaking by telephone from his hospital bed, expressed elation on 
learning that a suspect had been found. "Fantastic!" he said. "It's no 
surprise, though. We got a bunch of pros out there." 
</P>
<P>
Coovert said he and his wife, Betty, were confronted inside Garrick's Flowers, 
a florist shop they operate in the 6000 block of Orangethorpe Avenue, by a 
robber who demanded that the couple sit on chairs in the back of the store, 
then turn over all their cash and Betty Coovert's purse. 
</P>
<P>
Coovert said he was shot when he refused and "went for" the young robber, whom 
he thought was carrying a toy gun. Betty Coovert was not hurt in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$50 Taken 
</P>
<P>
"I just reacted to my training and what I could see," Coovert said. "I didn't 
want to see him get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
After he shot Coovert, the robber took about $50 in cash and left the store. 
Coovert said he remained conscious while paramedics rushed him to Western 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
There, he underwent several hours of surgery for the wounds to his head, 
kidneys and spleen. One of the bullets struck very near his left eye, 
shattering the eye lens, Coovert said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have indicated that they do not know whether he will be able to see out 
of that eye again, Coovert said. An eye operation was scheduled for today, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coovert said that doctors believe that he can be released Sunday. He said he 
hopes to return to work soon at the flower shop, which he and his wife have 
operated since he took a disability retirement from the Buena Park Police 
Department in 1973.

Robert C. Flory, an offensive lineman from Huntington Beach, and two other 
University of Arizona football players have been placed on probation by the 
school's athletic department as a result of separate off-the-field incidents 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Financial aid was withdrawn for seniors-to-be Flory and Donald G. Salum, an 
outside linebacker from Colorado Springs. Flory, Salum and junior-to-be 
defensive lineman Paul W. Glonek of Palos Hills, Ill., were placed on 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Cedric Dempsey said legal proceedings are pending against 
Flory and Salum. 
</P>
<P>
Flory faces misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest, threats and intimidation, 
disorderly conduct and criminal damage. He was arrested at a bar after officers 
said he allegedly assaulted and threatened two men and scuffled with police. 
</P>
<P>
Flory played for the Wildcats last season, but underwent back surgery during 
the winter and Coach Dick Tomey said previously he would not play in the fall.

FATONE BEATS PINTO IN LEADING LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tracey Fatone proved that last week's victory over Martha Pinto was no fluke as 
the freshman again defeated Pinto in the 1,600 meters to help Los Alamitos High 
School win the girls' Empire League track and field finals Thursday at 
Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins finished with 123 points. Esperanza was second with 112 1/2, and 
Loara finished in third place with 85. 
</P>
<P>
Fatone pulled away in the last 200 yards to win in 5 minutes 10.5 seconds. 
Pinto was second in 5:16.9. 
</P>
<P>
Fatone's victories marked only the second time in three years that Katella's 
Pinto has lost consecutive races. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins received a strong performance from Pam Kurtela, who was the team's 
only double winner. Kurtela finished first in the 200 meters (26.02) and 400 
meters (58.66). 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza kept close as it won the 400-meter relay (50.67) and 1,600-meter 
relay (3:57.4). Los Alamitos was second in the 1,600 relay (4:05.6) and El 
Dorado third (4:13.5). 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Graton led Loara, winning the 110-meter low hurdles (15.33) and 300 low 
hurdles (46.91). She also finished tied for second in the high jump (5 feet 4 
inches). 
</P>
<P>
Lori Svoboda of El Dorado won the high jump with a leap of 5-8. She was also 
second in the 200 (26.07). 
</P>
<P>
In the Empire League boys' meet: 
</P>
<P>
Roshawn Sims won the 200 and 400 as Esperanza eased to victory at Fullerton 
College with 158 points. Katella was second with 97, and Loara third with 93. 
</P>
<P>
Sims ran a 22.60 in the 200 to finish just ahead of Loara's Coy Collins, who 
ran a 22.63. Sims also finished third in the triple jump with a leap of 42-7 
1/2. 
</P>

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
KENNEDY MOVES OUT TO TAKE TOP SPOT WITH A 2-1 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some savvy base running by Kennedy High School catcher Kris Vucurevic helped 
lead the Fighting Irish to a 2-1 victory over Garden Grove in a Garden Grove 
League softball game Thursday at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (18-4 overall, 11-1 in league play) avenged an earlier loss to Garden 
Grove and took sole possession of first place in the league with two games 
remaining. Garden Grove dropped to 17-9 and 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Vucurevic scored the winning run in the bottom of the sixth. With one out, 
center fielder Suzie Berdis hit a high chopper to third and beat the throw for 
a single. She advanced to second on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Vucurevic hit a grounder to shortstop Michelle Cash, who faked the throw to 
first and then threw to second to catch Berdis between bases. The third baseman 
and second baseman got her in a rundown, with second baseman Cyndi Horton 
eventually making the tag. 
</P>
<P>
During the rundown, Vucurevic reached second with a head-first slide. Kennedy 
pitcher Cheryl Longeway then singled to third and Vucurevic came home with the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Longeway (16-3) not only knocked in the winning RBI, she pitched a two-hitter 
with 10 strikeouts. Three of them came in the top of the seventh to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Longeway) has to, she'll bear down and nobody will get hits off her," 
Kennedy assistant coach Janet Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
A call by plate umpire Charles Durbin in the bottom of the fourth seemed to get 
the Kennedy batters' dander up. 
</P>
<P>
With no score in the game, Kennedy shortstop Missi Gyde hit a towering fly ball 
over center fielder Andrea Handley's head for an apparent home run and 
Kennedy's first hit. But Durbin ruled her out, saying she never touched third 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"That fired our team up right there," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Hill singled, then stole second. Garden Grove pitcher Stephanie Smith 
walked Stacy Wahlsteen. Then third baseman Gina Alcosar punched a single to 
left field to score Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove came back in the top of the sixth. Kim Clark reached on an error 
and advanced to second on Smith's sacrifice bunt. Catcher Becky Eggers hit a 
grounder through the infield for a single to advance Clark to third. 
</P>
<P>
Berdis' throw from center field was wild, and by the time Vucurevic recovered 
the ball, Eggers had reached second. In the meantime, Clark alertly came home, 
beating the throw from second base to tie the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove batters then struck out and flied out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande 4, Santiago 3 -- Catcher Cherie Samson hit two triples, scored 
twice and had two RBIs to lead Bolsa Grande (7-12, 5-7) at Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos 3, La Quinta 1 -- Alison Campbell pitched a three-hitter, striking 
out two, for Los Amigos at La Quinta. Bobbie Cloyd pitched a two-hitter for La 
Quinta, but the Aztecs made three errors in the fifth, which led to all three 
Los Amigos runs.

JUNIOR GIRLS' TENNIS TOURNAMENT;

PHEBUS, MALL GAIN QUARTERFINALS 
</P>

<P>
Two of Orange County's top junior girls' tennis players, Keri Phebus of Newport 
Beach and Anne Mall of Laguna Niguel, are among the participants in the 14th 
Seventeen Magazine Tennis Tournament of Champions at the Marguerite Recreation 
Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
As two of the 96 juniors invited to the four-day tournament, they are hoping, 
perhaps, to become the next Tracy Austin -- who one year played the event until 
her feet blistered. Or perhaps Andrea Jaeger, Kathy Rinaldi or Zina Garrison, 
who also have participated in past years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have so many future goals and aspirations," Phebus said. "I know I can do it 
(reach the professional ranks). That keeps me on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Phebus and Mall will be on the courts today in quarterfinal matches after 
advancing with victories Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Phebus, 15 and ranked 18th nationally in 16s, cruised through two-set matches 
in the first and second rounds of the 16s. She defeated Susie Starrett of North 
Aurora, Ill., 6-2, 6-0, Wednesday, and Courtney Roberts of Lexington, Ky., 6-0, 
6-1, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mall, 14 and ranked 37th nationally in 18s, also advanced with two-set 
victories at 18s, but had more problems Thursday than on the first day. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous going into the match," Mall said. "After that first set (which 
Mall won, 6-4), I loosened up and felt more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
She broke the service of Michelle McMillen, of East Palestine, Ohio, in every 
game of her 6-1 second-game victory Thursday. She blamed her aggressiveness for 
the one loss. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning I played more aggressive, but I kept missing," Mall said. 
"And there was no time to attack. There weren't any long rallies. I felt if I 
hit (hard), I'd miss." 
</P>
<P>
So she went to soft lobs just to get through the match and waited for McMillen 
to commit an error, which she did frequently in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mall defeated Dawn Martin of St. Clair Shores, Mich., 6-0. 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mall will face Christine Newman of Downers Grove, Ill. Phebus will play 
Jennifer Nasser, who is seeded seventh,of Arlington Heights, Ill., in today's 
matches, which are scheduled for 10 a.m.

Rancho Santiago College, which had turned the Orange Empire Conference baseball 
race into a stumbling contest of late, finally fell out of first place 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago started the day tied for first place, but Golden West rallied 
for two runs in the ninth to defeat the Dons, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress defeated Saddleback, 7-5, Thursday to move into first place alone with 
one game left. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (30-13 overall and 16-7 in the conference) is now a half-game ahead of 
Orange Coast (29-11-1, 16-8) and one game ahead of Rancho Santiago (26-25, 
15-8), which has lost three of its past four games. The winner of the 
conference gets an automatic bid into the Southern California Regional 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton plays at Cypress, and Rancho Santiago is at Saddleback Saturday at 
noon. OCC has a bye. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago took a 9-8 lead into the ninth, but Golden West got to reliever 
Chris Floth, who had pitched four shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
Floth got Craig Paquette, Golden West's best hitter, to pop up to start the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Bammer then walked and was replaced by pinch-runner Scott Turner. Turner 
advanced to second on a passed ball, and scored on a single by Jeff Repoz. 
</P>
<P>
Repoz stole second and scored on a single up the middle by Dan Villegas to put 
Golden West ahead, 10-9. Floth (0-1) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Turner retired the first two batters in the ninth, but Joey Townsend 
doubled to give Rancho Santiago a final chance. But pinch-hitter George Saldana 
grounded out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Turner (5-3) replaced Golden West starter Toby Foreman in the sixth and didn't 
allow a run in the final four innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We made too many mistakes today," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. "We 
let them get into too many situations they could take advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
Bammer had a sacrifice fly and Repoz hit a two-run home run in the first for 
Golden West. Marty Neff hit a three-run home in the first for Rancho Santiago 
to tie it, 3-3. It was the team-leading 11th home run for Neff. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West scored single runs in the second and third, but Rancho Santiago 
scored four runs in the fourth to take a 7-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West got a two-run home run from Paquette and a solo home run from 
Bammer in the fifth to take an 8-7 lead. It was the 12th home run for Paquette, 
and the sixth for Bammer. 
</P>
<P>
After Bammer's home run, Rancho Santiago starter Willie Navarrette was replaced 
by Floth. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago tied it, 8-8, in the fifth on an RBI double by Louie Maldonado 
and went ahead, 9-8, on an RBI single by Neff in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 7, Saddleback 5 -- Visiting Cypress scored six runs in the second to 
take control. The first two came on an error, then Jason Friedman and Brett 
Gregory had RBI singles and Ken Kendrena had a two-run double to cap the 
inning. Steve Gill and Friedman had back-to-back doubles for Cypress' final run 
in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Burbank (12-4) pitched 8 2/3 for the victory. Rich Lodding got the save. 
Brent Ferguson hit two home runs, his fourth and fifth, for Saddleback 
(16-17-1, 8-14-1). 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 9, Fullerton 4 -- OCC scored five unearned runs in the ninth to 
break a 4-4 tie at Fullerton. Marty Cordova drove in the final three runs of 
the ninth with triple. Jason Young had a three-run home run for Orange Coast. 
Eddie Pierce (4-1) got the victory. Mike Segovia had a solo homer for Fullerton 
(7-16, 12-26).

Home builders are making a bundle, even in this year's slower housing market, 
if the financial results from one publicly held home builder are an indication. 
</P>
<P>
Standard Pacific L.P. reported recently that net income rose 151% for the first 
3 months of the year, to $23.6 million from $9.4 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 17%, to $102.5 million from $87.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa company credited most of its leap in profits to the steep rise 
in prices for new homes last year. The company builds medium-priced houses in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
And Covington Development Group Inc., Fullerton, reported first-quarter 
earnings of $1.7 million on sales of $26.8 million, contrasted with a loss of 
$1 million on sales of $7.2 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Covington credited the rebound to a cost-reduction program and also said its 
gross profit margins had increased to 13%, from 11% last year.

<P>
'BALD SOPRANO' HITS THE HIGH AND THE LOW NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eugene Ionesco, theater's lyrical contortionist, aimed at several targets with 
his absurdist plays, but the pretense and hypocrisy of society were two of his 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
His writing often searched for the groin of humanity and, with a surrealist's 
glee, tried to hit it with a firm kick. Not every effort reaches the mark, but 
many did. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best is "The Bald Soprano," a one-act that is both hilarious and sad 
in its reflection of Ionesco's basic view of life as a pointless stew we are 
forced to gobble every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Soprano," which is given a confident performance by the Rancho Santiago 
College Professional Actors Conservatory, begins with Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Jim 
McLean and Kemi Lapite) sitting in their average suburban home having a 
painfully average conversation about nothing much. 
</P>
<P>
She babbles on about this and that; he grunts or clucks every now and then and 
reads the evening newspaper with a fatalist's appreciation of how rotten it's 
all getting. Friends from the city are expected soon. Maybe they can bring 
something interesting into the humdrum. 
</P>
<P>
When Mr. and Mrs. Martin (Brian Hickman and Suzanne Doherty) finally show, they 
are left briefly to amuse themselves, and Ionesco sets off on one of his most 
remarkable passages. Mr. and Mrs. Martin act like strangers meeting awkwardly 
for the first time at the home of mutual friends. They talk sheepishly, then 
more intimately, until they discover that they have been sleeping in the same 
bed for several years. There's a shade of horror in their surprise. After they 
recover, they vow not to lose each other again. 
</P>
<P>
As a comment on marriage it's pretty devastating, but it also says much about 
our inability to really connect with anyone, even someone we think we love. If 
the experience of a deep emotion such as love is merely sleepwalking, what can 
we expect from everyday life? 
</P>
<P>
Other scenes are just as pointed. Everyone tells jokes and little stories (the 
play's title is from one of these anecdotes) that make no sense or are so banal 
they make your brain itch. But everybody laughs uproariously, not out of 
politeness but to maintain the illusion that their lives are exciting and full. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its uninhibited abstraction, "Soprano" expects a lot from actors -- 
expressions, gestures and inflections have to say even more than usual here. 
The PAC cast, under Jerry McGonigle's direction, comes through. Lapite's prim, 
proud and ultimately confused Mrs. Smith is the best interpretation, but 
everyone does justice to his or her character. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lesson" (also directed by McGonigle) is not as important a one-act, but it 
does have a nails-scratching-the-blackboard edginess that can get to you. In 
this one, Ionesco rails against pedantry in the schools and, through 
projection, the amoral, destructive force of fascism. 
</P>
<P>
We watch as an imbalanced professor (David Langdon) tutors a young student 
(Jana Webb) in the ABCs. It all starts off reasonably enough, but soon he's 
berating her, then he's losing control and then, in an ugly denouement, he 
cannot resist violence. 
</P>
<P>
The performances here aren't quite equal to those in "Soprano," but Langdon 
does make the professor a frightening, all-too predictable little man. 
</P>
<P>
'THE BALD SOPRANO' and 'THE LESSON' 
</P>
<P>

Ionesco's one-act plays. Directed by Jerry McGonigle. With Jim McLean, Kemi

JUNIOR WELLS WAS FUN, IF YOU STUCK AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junior Wells playing the Coach House Wednesday night was play in its most 
fundamental sense. 
</P>
<P>
After more than 35 years as one of the leading masters of the Chicago blues, 
Wells wasn't bound by such considerations as image or observing the proprieties 
of tradition. The only thing that seemed to matter in his 1 1/2 hours on stage 
was having a relaxed, spontaneous good time. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, 54, reveled in the fun of experimentation. He contorted his voice or 
blew unexpected phrases on his harmonica as the whim struck him from moment to 
moment. With a flick of his right hand, he summoned up solos and rhythmic 
shifts from his sidemen as if he were old King Cole calling for his pipe and 
his bowl and his fiddlers three. After all these years as a top-of-the-line 
bluesman, it came as no surprise that Wells' whims tended to work as well as if 
they were considered steps in some master plan. 
</P>
<P>
It is a good thing that Wells is capable of keeping up his enthusiasm while 
playing a show just for the fun of it. He was the final act on a 
harmonica-driven blues triple bill that ultimately took 5 hours to complete. By 
the time Wells came on, after an overly long, 25-minute warm-up set by his 
six-man band, less than half the original crowd was left. And by the time he 
finished, he and his band were playing mainly for their own pleasure because 
only 25 or so enthusiastic die-hards were left in the club. 
</P>
<P>
When he sang, Wells' sense of play led him to interject a wide range of cries, 
moans, trills, percussive tongue pops and James Brown-style soul shouts into 
most songs. Far from gimmickry, these devices added a wider range of colors to 
a sturdy and pliant voice that also was quite capable of delivering 
straightforward blues. 
</P>
<P>
Wells covered the straight blues with songs like "Hoodoo Man," which moved 
through dynamic shifts that took it from quiet mystery at the start to 
ebullience by the end. He made the James Brown connection explicit late in the 
show by singing "I Feel Good (I Got You)," and ended with Ray Charles' "What'd 
I Say," as if to drive home the value of the blues-soul merger. 
</P>
<P>
As a harmonica player, Wells was an engaging tease. Instead of blowing liberal, 
extended solos, he would serve up an idea, trail off, let one of his sidemen 
take the lead, and then come back with another idea, this time with different 
tones and phrases. For Wells, playing the harmonica was like a conversation 
that follows no script. When an idea came, he spoke his piece. And he often 
delighted in improvising ways to twine his harmonica's voice with solo parts by 
his two saxophone players, or with the spiky, fast-flurrying tones of lead 
guitarist Steve Ditzell. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Musselwhite, another veteran Chicago blues harmonica player, preceded 
Wells with a 90-minute set that was skillful and prolific, yet far less 
engaging. Musselwhite's harmonica glided with seamless ease from low notes to 
high-pitched wails. But because his playing was so fluid, it soon took on a 
sameness that Wells averted with his conversational choppiness. Add to that the 
fact that Musselwhite's singing and most of his material were unremarkable, and 
it made for long stretches of music that were pleasant but not memorable. 
</P>
<P>
There were high points, though. A good, grinding blues provided some punch 
early in the show, and the last half-hour gained momentum, concluding with the 
moaning, graceful slow song, "Christo Redemptor." Musselwhite's forceful 
backing trio probably could have followed him into more adventurous territory 
had he chosen to take the lead by emphasizing more interactive playing. 
</P>
<P>
The Mighty Flyers, local roots-and-blues veterans, emphasized showmanship in 
their 55-minute opening set. Showpieces included Rod Piazza roaming through the 
audience while blowing breathy harmonica blasts, a lengthy solo piano boogie, 
and a sharp, varied drum-and-bass solo segment. But these bits all went on too 
long and eventually wore out their welcome. A better balance between the solo 
set pieces and ensemble playing would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Flyers are at the Sunset Pub, 16655 Pacific Coast Highway, Sunset 
Beach, through Saturday. Show time tonight: 9:30 p.m. Admission: $3. 
Information: (213) 592-1926.

SOME PLACES TO MUNCH BRUNCH WITH MOTHER 
</P>

<P>
Mother's Day is almost here, and for many families, that means celebrating in 
the form of a festive Sunday brunch. Hotels are always a reliable bet on 
holidays, but the choice is by no means limited to them. Check to see if your 
favorite restaurant is planning to open, and, if not, consider one of the 
following suggestions. But remember, these brunch spots are popular enough on 
normal Sundays, so make reservations as soon as possible. All are sure to be 
booked solid days before the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
If mother has sumptuous tastes, the first-class buffet brunch at the Newporter 
Resort seems an obvious choice. Chef Jon Benson plans an even bigger spread 
than he had at Easter, when several rooms were filled with tables groaning with 
haute specialties. 
</P>
<P>
Begin at the cold table and choose smoked tuna and salmon, carved to order, or 
ethereal minceur terrines made from wild mushrooms, scallops and other luxury 
items. Then proceed to the breakfast station where omelets, pasta dishes and 
pancakes are cooked to order with such embellishments as caviar, chorizo, pesto 
or fresh berries. 
</P>
<P>
Hot dishes should be every bit as elaborate: Bourbon-glazed ham, beef 
Wellington and Benson's wonderful stuffed chicken, near to bursting with a 
mixture of chevre, spinach and wild mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
For those who can still eat, desserts include gateau St. Honore and golden 
raspberry mousse. There's free-flowing, complimentary champagne and a strolling 
Dixieland band. Seating is from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. in the Jamboree Cafe and 
the patio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newporter Resort, 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach. (714) 644-1700. 
Brunch is $19.95 for adults, $9.95 for children. All major cards accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Brunch at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point is probably the county's most 
expensive. The hotel offers a gorgeous natural setting, plus opulent trappings 
for its Pavilion buffet. There's a classical pianist, orchid sprigs for the 
ladies and a special children's table with dishes like Ovaltine porridge and 
peanut blueberry muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Come early and look around -- flowers are in bloom on the 18-acre garden 
overlooking the Pacific. Then get a load of the French tapestries and crystal 
chandeliers in the Ballroom where brunch is served. 
</P>
<P>
A cold salad bar features such delicacies as Oriental carpaccio, wild mushrooms 
and fresh fennel in a Chardonnay thyme vinaigrette, sliced fresh fruit with 
creme fraiche, and fresh shellfish. Hot stuffed veal and beef tenderloin with 
chanterelle and tarragon are carved to order. Don't miss the apple and almond 
crepes in rum raisin sauce, or chef Rassinoux's wonderful mousselines. You 
can't miss the centerpiece, a life-size ice carving of mother and child. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ritz-Carlton hotel, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point. (714) 240-5008. 
Brunch from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., $35 per person, $18 for children 12 and under. 
All major cards accepted. 
</P>
<P>
If a lively atmosphere is what you are after, Peppers is the ticket. This 
restaurant caters to singles, families and just about anybody else. This year's 
special brunch features a live barbershop quartet plus a gaudy spread that 
includes an eggs Benedict station, a Belgian waffle bar, made-to-order omelets, 
a fajitas bar, a shrimp and ceviche bar, a fresh fruit and salad bar and, hold 
your breath, a hot fudge sundae bar. The food is surprisingly good, and the 
prices more than reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppers, 12361 Chapman Ave., Plaza Alicante, Garden Grove. (714) 740-1333. 
Brunch from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., $12.95 for adults, $6.95 for children. All major 
cards accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi, an upscale Indian restaurant in South Coast Village, is a 
non-traditional Mother's Day alternative, but it may be just what mother would 
like. 
</P>
<P>
This is a rather formal restaurant where waiters wear tuxedos, tables are set 
in linen, and the tone is quiet and understated. But there is nothing 
understated about the food, which is highly spiced and almost overly rich. 
</P>
<P>
The special prix fixe menu will include tandoori chicken (cooked in the clay 
oven), lamb kabab, prawn saag (cooked with chopped spinach), chicken jalfrezi 
(sauteed in butter and spices, with tomato, bell pepper and onion), and the 
requisite north India vegetable dishes: eggplant with spring onion, garbanzo 
beans stewed with ginger, and vegetarian pilau. Sit in the glass-enclosed 
greenhouse for more exotic reflections. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi, 3820 Plaza Drive Santa Ana. (714) 556-7273. Champagne brunch from 
11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., $12.95 for adults, $6.60 for children under 10. All major 
cards accepted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Canterra looks as if it belongs in the tropics. It's a relaxing, luxurious 
restaurant with plenty of pastel colors, tropical plants and fresh flowers. It 
is located in Laguna Beach's San Maarten Hotel, about as exotic a locale as one 
can find in these parts, and I find it one of the area's most pleasant dining 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
All the stops will be pulled out on Mother's Day with a lavish, sit-down brunch 
including a fashion show staged by Chez Joey. Additionally, every mother will 
get a complimentary family picture. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Mark Price plans to serve dishes such as Cajun scramble, French toast 
stuffed with pear puree, a toothsome linguine primavera. He also has some 
surprises in store just for the occasion. There is no set price for the brunch, 
but champagne will be poured free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Canterra, 696 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (714) 494-0162. Brunch from 10 
a.m. to 3 p.m. All major cards accepted.

 A note from Times News Bites columnist Beverly Bush Smith: 
</P>
<P>
 Several restaurants normally closed on Sunday mornings will be open for 
Mother's Day brunch, including the Rex at Newport Pier ((714) 675-2566) and 
Monique French restaurant in Laguna Beach ((714) 499-5359). 
</P>
<P>

Carte Bistro in Huntington Beach will offer a special takeout brunch featuring 
10 different items for a minimum of four hungry people, at $11.95 per person. 
Dishes include a California fruit platter, seafood platter, chicken Mendocino 
and Swiss fresh strawberry cake ((714) 840-8152).

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttomare, 545 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 640-6333. Open 
Mondays through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays 11 to midnight; Saturdays 
11:30 to midnight, Sundays 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is fluid and solicitious at this smart, stunning restaurant, situated 
in the building that used to house the Savannah Grill, but the kitchen is 
having its ups and downs. Wonderful, yeasty foccaccia bread served with virgin 
olive oil and the fine grilled seafoods are some of the ups. Naked vegetables 
and bland pasta dishes are some of the downs. Lombata di vitello, veal chop 
with fontina and prosciutto, is one reason to go back for a second look. 
</P>
<P>
Umi, 2075 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 631-2208. Open Tuesdays through 
Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Umi is a modern and imaginative but often unprofessional sushi bar with 
high-tech pretensions, and knowing what to order is important: You are safe if 
you stick with the sushi, which is fresh and crafted with an excellently 
prepared rice, but it is easy to run aground on the many hot dishes. Among 
them, best are a wonderful scallop casserole, a toothsome Japanese steak, and 
yaki-onigiri, grilled triangles of sushi rice with various fillings. Service 
can be painfully slow. 
</P>
<P>
Pinnacle Peak, 9100 Trask Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 892-7311. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Dr., Santa Ana. (714) 549-1512. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturdays and Sundays 5 p.m. to 2 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else is busy disavowing addiction to good steak, sneak off to 
one of these places. Leave the tie at home when you visit Pinnacle Peak; 
someone will sneak up on you and cut it off. Honest. The restaurant's trail 
boss steak, cooked over an open flame, is a char-broiled monster, a great value 
at $9.95. The Crazy Horse is a bit longer on atmosphere but, apart from the 
high-grade beef, it's run-of-the-mill. Many of the side dishes have been 
frozen, and the whole place has a packaged feel about it. 
</P>
<P>
Garduno's Ristorante Italiano, 298 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-5505. 
Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays till 10 p.m., 
Saturdays noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Garduno's may be the quintessential Italian sidewalk cafe-except the sidewalk 
is missing. Mark and Julie Garduno, an engaging young couple, run the place as 
if it was a small family room, serving fresh, home-cooked fare that often 
delights. Standout dishes include a killer carbonara loaded with fresh peas, 
pancetta and sauteed mushrooms; and a fabulous fusilli, twirly pasta spirals in 
a chunky tomato sauce with big pieces of homemade sausage. The regular menu has 
all the favorites, the cappuccino is frothy, and there are wonderful creamy 
cheesecakes to boot. 
</P>
<P>
California Wok, 4466 Cerritos Ave., Los Alamitos. (714) 527-0226. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Eat health conscious, pan-Asian food in this spotless litle gem, owned and 
operated by a Thai microbiologist who is a gem herself (her name, Baiyok, means 
jade leaf.) Chinese dishes here are excellent, prepared with pure soy oil. 
Especially good are vegetarian egg rolls, and stir fried chicken in an edible 
basket of straw potato. Thai dishes are equally fine. Nam sod is fiery ground 
pork with chili. Pad Thai are fried flat noodles. And tod mun plar, rubbery 
fish cakes with mint and cilantro, are wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
The Cellar at Villa Del Sol, 305 N. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton. (714) 525-5682. 
Open Tuesdays through Saturdays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cellar is one of those "occasion restaurants" in the grand manner; whatever 
the kitchen lacks in imagination is made up for handsomely by quality and 
consistency. Pass on the ready-made items like smoked salmon, caviar and the 
various salads. They miss the point. The chef here can cook. See that he does. 
Best are lamb, pheasant, veal Florentine and the ethereal desserts. The 
souffles, naturally, are perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Far Pavilions, 1520 W. Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 548-7167. Open seven 
days, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Elegant, beachfront Indian dining. Far Pavilions has a surfeit of specialties 
hard to find in other local restaurants: minced chicken balls in a spicy tomato 
puree; bhindi masala, a.k.a. curried okra; Bihari kabab, a saucy chicken dish 
from north central India. Some flavors run together here, but you can avoid 
that problem by sandwiching dishes in the fine tandoori breads from the 
restaurant's clay oven. Meats from the same oven are so good they should be 
eaten bareheaded, kneeling. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10 
p.m., to 11 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new 
restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest 
adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red, '80s-chic motif 
complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen, and a comal, the high-tech 
version of a stone tortilla cooker. The restaurant smokes its own meats, and 
you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila. 
Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz, 211 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton (714) 738-9339 and 158 W. Main St., 
Tustin (714) 731-9807. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenery Natural Kitchen, 119 E. Commonwealth Ave., Fullerton (714) 
870-0981 and 323 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim (714) 761-8103. Open Monday through 
Fridays, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturdays 10 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz in Fullerton looks as if it belongs on a college campus; the food 
they serve does too. Best avoid the frozen poultry casseroles in favor of the 
meatless dishes like stuffed squash or veggie lasagna. Desserts like carrot 
cake and apple pie are reminiscent of a church bake sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenery is a modest, unadorned storefront restaurant with homey, 
health-conscious fare. Best dishes are the lentil burrito, with guacamole, and 
the unburger, made from ground nuts and brown rice. 
</P>
<P>
Both restaurants are inexpensive, with few dishes over $5. 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet, 328 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4955. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 5 to 10 p.m., to 11 Fridays through Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Michael Kang has some of the most compelling art around decorating this 
restaurant's somber, postmodern walls, and he serves plates of food very nearly 
as artful. Dishes of pot stickers or steamed dumpling are no better than you 
would get in any Chinese restaurant, but the eclectic lamb, scallop, and 
catfish entrees demonstrate Kang's flair. The catfish is particularly fine. 
</P>
<P>
Crocodile Cafe in the Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea. (714) 529-CAFE. 
Open seven days 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., to 12 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Smith is doing more than just promoting the new American cuisine; he's 
making it into a populist movement at this small, laughably inexpensive cafe. 
Enjoy wonderful hamburgers grilled over smoking embers of oak, wood-fired 
pizzas with designer toppings, and trendy homemade pastas like fettucine with 
roasted Pasilla chili and ancho-cream. Sit under the 30-foot vinyl crocodile 
sipping boutique wines. You can bet your Beamer that this restaurant is a good 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714) 
859-9393. Open Tuesdays through Sundays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic 
dining areas anywhere: clustered tent canopies among a maze of mirrors with an 
almost mystical dimension. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no 
utensils, and are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings: b'stilla (a 
sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a savory 
vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire. The Arabic music 
accompanying her is deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open weekdays 10 a.m. 
to 10:30 p.m., weekends until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a 
crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture: The crowd is as diverse as the 
menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic-centered beef) are 
two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50 
noodle dishes. While away the day listening to Asian pop music, gawking at the 
New Wavers and sipping filter coffee and tropical freezes made from durian and 
jackfruit. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Continental Cafe, 36 Plaza Square, Orange. (714) 633-5842. Open seven 
days from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
You can smell the garlic for blocks around this European-looking, Cuban style 
cafe in the old downtown of Orange. The menu abounds with exotica. Papa 
rellena, a potato and egg croquette rolled in bread crumbs, is about the best 
appetizer. Roast chicken Cubano, a crispy half chicken with bitter orange peel 
added for extra dimension, is definitely the best entree. Save room for dessert 
-- it is the best course here. Pineapple-raisin bread pudding, a soft, buttery 
suspension of rum, eggs, flour and fruit, is good enough to make Betty Crocker 
blush. 
</P>
<P>
Caffe Piemonte, 1835 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 532-3296. Open Tuesdays 
through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Sundays 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two brothers from Piemonte, one of Italy's most scenic provinces, have opened 
this handsome, spotless little trattoria in the city of Orange, and already it 
has become a county hot spot. Start any meal here with the wonderful, sumptuous 
antipasto and then move on to one of chef Luigi Ravetto's hand-extruded 
homemade pastas (such as chewy ruotelle, little, six-spoked wheels perfect for 
soaking up sauce). Ravetto's cooking is somewhat generic, but he has included 
polenta, the cornmeal staple of his province, and you really should try it. His 
polenta Piemontese, with a light, grainy cheese sauce, is most appealing. 
</P>
<P>
California Pizza Kitchen, Newport Center/Fashion Island, 1151 Newport Center 
Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 759-5543. Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. 
to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays to 11, Sundays to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 80s has come the designer pizza, and it looks as if the phenom is 
here to stay. That's what the California Pizza Kitchen is banking on, anyway. 
This slicked-down operation, designed for flash and staffed with young, 
beautiful people, serves an eclectic, almost futuristic array of pizzas topped 
with everything from goat cheese to peanut sauce. Service is somewhat 
indifferent at present; high-energy owners Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfeld should 
fix that problem soon. Best to stick with the pizzas that don't fall too far 
from the tree; five-cheese, homemade sausage, and a delicious barbecued 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
1520 AD, 821 S. Beach Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 995-5464. Seatings are Fridays at 
7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The food at 1520 AD may not be authentic Tudor, but who cares? When you eat 
with your fingers, everything tastes better. The opening course at this 
re-creation of a Merrie Olde England roadhouse is a hearty lentil barley soup, 
drunk from large draughts and eaten with hunks of brown bread. There is a 
choice of four entrees: slow cooked chicken, lamb shank in a white sauce, steak 
kabob, and a most modern filet of halibut with a heathen Spanish sauce on top. 
The abundant platters of rice and vegetables, the fine, lemony pound cake, and 
the bottomless mugs of ice-cold beer make for a dinner that King Henry himself 
would have enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
Granville's, in the Disneyland Hotel, 1150 W. Cerritos Ave., Anaheim. (714) 
778-6600. Open Tuesdays through Saturdays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Disneyland Hotel might not immediately spring to mind when the subject of 
restaurants comes up, but it ought to: Granville's, its flagship restaurant, is 
one of the best around. The room is designed for elegance, with mahogany 
sideboards, Regency-style chairs and overwhelming shades of burgundy. Chef Tim 
Owen trained with Boston cooking teacher Madeleine Kamman, and his cuisine is 
original and delicate. Such appetizers as Little Neck clams steamed in Pernod 
with spinach are wonderful, as are such entrees as loin of lamb in an anise 
crust, oven roasted with thyme and rosemary. There is an extensive wine list 
(featuring American wines only), and the service is impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
Thai Nakorn, 8674 Stanton Ave., Buena Park. (714) 952-4954. Open Tuesdays 
through Saturdays 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thai Nakorn is an innocent looking storefront restaurant -- but inside awaits 
the blistering fare of northeast Thailand, arguably the world's hottest 
cuisine. A long list of specialties will make a believer out of you, ones like 
larb, ground pork with brown rice, onion, lime juice and chili, or nuad dad 
deal, a dried, salted beef with a faint aftertaste of the sea. Appetizers show 
the restaurant's class: Try a savage barbecued shrimp salad with mint sprig, 
and a homemade sausage wrapped up in cabbage leaves. Frog, eel and other 
exotica can be ordered from a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
McCharles House, 335 South C St., Tustin. (714) 731-4063. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. for lunch, 2 to 6 p.m. for tea; Thursdays through 
Saturdays 5:30 to 9 p.m. for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
If you have never experienced a proper English tea, then now is your chance at 
this converted Victorian house, built circa 1885 in old town Tustin. You'll 
even get heart-shaped scones. Audrey Heredia and her daughter Vivian fuss over 
this dining and tea room, a spinster's fantasy of wooden tables, tasseled lamps 
and enough doilies to make Gladys Cooper an overcoat. Lunch is a choice of 
salads and little tea sandwiches. Dinner is simple and sweet. Don't miss a 
tempting array of home-baked goodies such as the rich chocolate cake served 
with clotted cream. 
</P>
<P>
Spats, 901 Civic Center Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 558-1883. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m to 2 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 5 to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Spats is one of those maddeningly confusing little restaurants where it is 
impossible to know what you are supposed to be eating. The chef is Japanese. 
The menu is Italian and Japanese. The ambiance is pure California. Best to try 
are the more Japanese dishes like broiled beef on bamboo skewer, fresh oysters 
in the shell with Japanese dipping sauce, and soba, handmade buckwheat noodles 
treated with a simple respect. Avoid the gummy pastas and the pretentious 
Western concoctions. Most of them are better left to the concept stage. There 
is an adjoining disco if you get too impatient waiting for service. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Fish Company, 11061 Los Alamitos Blvd., Los Alamitos. (213) 
594-4553. Open Sundays through Thursdays 11 a.m to 10 p.m., Fridays and 
Saturdays until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Order mesquite broiled fish from the restaurant's giant circular grill, or 
enjoy a brace of other dishes such as steamed Dungeness crab, smoked albacore 
tuna or simply flavored steamers, all of which go beautifully with the 
restaurant's standout sourdough bread. Desserts are all homemade. The best of 
them are a superior blackout cake and a soft, tart, lemon mousse pie. 
</P>
<P>
Soup Exchange, 151 E. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. (714) 992-5522. Open daily 
11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Salmagundi, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. (714) 549-9267. Open Mondays 
through Saturdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sundays noon to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Eat soup, live longer at these two emporia for our favorite comfort food. Soup 
Exchange is the slicker and less expensively packaged of the two, a soup and 
salad bar with such extras as frozen yogurt and muffins and a nacho bar to 
boot. It's all you can eat and every man for himself. Salmagundi is homier and 
even a bit trendy, with such exotic soups as tortilla, wild rice and country 
Cheddar; they change daily. Salmagundi also has a dessert bar where you can 
indulge in such goodies as trifle, apple brown betty and chocolate mousse. 
Either restaurant redefines the word excess. 
</P>
<P>
Scampi, 1576 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-8560. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily from 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Scampi is the name of a dark, noisy and unassuming Neapolitan style trattoria 
that has come to the nether reaches of Newport Boulevard, and it is already 
bringing new energy to the street. Chef Massimo Navaretta specializes in 
scampi, those outsized Italian crustaceans with a flavor between lobster and 
shrimp, but does many other things to perfection as well. Zuppa di vongole, the 
house version of steamed clams, has mysterious fragrances from a combination of 
herbs. Timballo di verdure, a flat noodle layered with fresh ricotta, 
vegetables, and herbs, is irresistible. Wear your T-shirt. The waiters do. 
</P>
<P>
Shan-Li Palace, 5634 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim. (714) 779-1410. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays to 11 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This Mandarin-style Chinese restaurant is further proof that gentrification is 
spreading like a brush fire. It is nestled snugly in the Anaheim Hills not far 
from the Riverside County line; a few years back you couldn't have found a 
hamburger stand in these parts. Order the steamed dumplings, despite the fact 
that the waiter may try to discourage you. They are wonderful. Spinach bean 
curd soup tastes as fresh as if the spinach came from out back. Twice cooked 
pork is fiery and colorful. Moo-shu dishes, minced meats and veggies rolled up 
burrito style, are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Mene's Terrace, 23532 El Toro Road (Orange Tree Plaza), El Toro. (714) 
830-3228. Open Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 9:30 p.m., 
Saturdays 5 to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mene's Terrace is like a sun-splashed Aegean taverna, transported magically to 
an El Toro shopping mall. You know you are not in Greece because you can see 
the Denny's just outside the window. The menu is small, but everything is 
prepared the way an Orthodox grandmother would prepare it. Tiropita and 
spanakopita, little cheese and spinach pies in a filo crust, are near perfect. 
The egg lemon soup is even better. Wonderful char-grilled meats, marinated in 
lemon juice and Greek spices, are served with rice pilaf and pan roasted 
potatoes. There is even complimentary baklava at dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
A La Carte Bistro, 16847 Algonquin Road (Huntington Harbour Mall), Huntington 
Beach. (714) 840-8152. Open Mondays through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., 
Fridays to 10 p.m., Saturdays 5:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The A La Carte Bistro has a giant menu for such a tiny space, and the portions 
are giant to match. Chef Friedrich Rechberger has a dedication that borders on 
fanaticism, and a deft hand behind the range. You have got to see the house 
salad to believe it, a huge, European-style platter of mixed salads that comes 
with dinner. Such game dishes as rabbit, venison, and quail abound. A must here 
is one of the chef's special desserts, such as Kaiserschmarn, a chopped-up, 
butter-fried pancake served with powdered sugar and pureed apricot. Guaranteed 
to keep the wolf from the door for days. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Khyber, 1000 N. Bristol St., Newport Beach. (714) 752-5200. Open Sundays 
through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and daily 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuisine at Royal Khyber is the rich Mughlai type from north India and the 
restaurant has a richness to match; it resembles a maharaja's palace. The best 
time to visit is for Sunday brunch, when a tempting array of more than 20 
dishes is spread out before you. Meats cooked in the 800-degree tandoor are 
tender and crumbly with exotic spices. Biryani, a simple basmati rice dish with 
peas and fried onions is soft and fragrant. Among the many other dishes, 
chicken curry, channa masala (stewed garbanzo beans) and the dessert, a 
carrot-almond pudding, are most memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Steamers, 444 N. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton. (714) 738-0781. Open daily 11 a.m. to 
11 p.m., until midnight on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Steamers is an ingenuous new seafood house in downtown Fullerton that is 
reminiscent of the wharf area in San Francisco, and the ambiance is big and 
bright. Owners Parin and Nazy Hirani have operated a Steamers in Placentia for 
several years now and are familiar with the problems facing a new restaurant, 
so things run smoothly. There is a large selection of fresh fish in a glass 
case staring you in the face as you enter, and the kitchen will prepare them 
any way you like. It is probably best to make use of the mesquite broiler, 
though, and to avoid any fancy preparation. Forget about sophistication and 
enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Be-Bop Burgers, 18575 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1958. Open daily 
10 a.m. to 10 p.m., 11 p.m. on weekends, with carhop service every night from 7 
till closing. 
</P>
<P>
Pinky's Hamburger Grill, 4115 Campus Drive, Irvine. (714) 854-4632. Open 
Tuesdays through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 
midnight, Sundays and Mondays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Be-Bop Burgers and Pinky's Hamburger Grill are part of a wave of "nostalgia" 
hamburger joints currently engulfing Orange County, and both are longer on 
atmosphere than food. The Be-Bop burger is a good value, a full quarter pound 
of lean beef on a seeded bun that just drips with condiments. Pinky's beach 
burgers are charcoal grilled and really taste good. Other sandwiches in both 
restaurants are less competent. 
</P>
<P>
China Palace, 2800 W. Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 631-8031. Open daily 
11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
China Palace is a curious hybrid of East and West with a healthy dose of 
California thrown in; call the cooking style PCH Peking. Prepared by a team of 
chefs from Taiwan, the food is of the solid, dependable, no-surprises variety 
that safely appeals to most Western palates. Minced squab on lettuce leaf is 
terrific. Orange flavor chicken has a delightful crunch to it. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrento Grill, 370 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-8686. Open Mondays 
through Saturdays 5:30 to 10 p.m., Sundays 5 to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrento Grill is one of the best new restaurants around, a virtual lock for 
local stardom. The restaurant is a high concept operation and it pushes all the 
right buttons: a stunningly designed open kitchen, postmodern vastness and a 
decibel level even Phillip Glass would object to. The food is wonderful. Young, 
innovative chef Roseanne Ruiz uses the finest ingredients, Chino ranch 
vegetables, carefully selected poultry and fish, and she prepares them with the 
finest olive oil and utmost care.

SINGLE LIFE: DIVORCE ANONYMOUS: A PEACEFUL HARBOR AFTER THE STORM OF MARITAL 
BREAKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, Susan Christian is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Nancy's husband left her after 25 years of marriage, she suffered "a 
terrible feeling of rejection, a horrible depression." 
</P>
<P>
For Judy, "the hardest thing was trying to leave the kids out of it." 
</P>
<P>
John, who had been married just 6 months when he discovered that his bride was 
having an affair, "went through a whole span of feelings -- abandonment, 
embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
Gwen's marital breakup left her with the sense that she "was completely alone 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
All four victims of marriages gone bad found solace and unity in Divorce 
Anonymous, a support group that meets weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy and Gwen, who along with the others asked that their last names not be 
printed, last year helped establish an Orange County chapter of the Los 
Angeles-based organization. About a dozen participants -- some returning, some 
new -- show up for the free meetings, held every Monday night at the YWCA in 
Orange (for information, call (714) 633-4950). 
</P>
<P>
The "DA" program follows the 12-step approach of Alcoholics Anonymous, focusing 
on internal strengths rather than external blame. "As in AA, our philosophy is 
to take one day at a time," Gwen said. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions are more conversational than structured. "Our meetings aren't 
monitored by a therapist," Gwen said. "We give each other support and advice." 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, people return to the group after dropping out for a while," Nancy 
said. "Going through a divorce is like being on a roller coaster. You can be up 
one day, down the next. It's nice to know (Divorce Anonymous) is there when you 
need it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes therapy alone is not enough, explained the 52-year-old Laguna Beach 
woman. "I've been in therapy ever since separating from my husband 3 years 
ago," Nancy said. "But this group helps me in a different way because you're 
with people who are going through the same things. 
</P>
<P>
"Our stories are always so similar that it sounds as if we were all married to 
the same person," Nancy added with a laugh. "That helps. You look at these 
other people who are all wonderful, and you realize that even wonderful people 
get left." 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to see your own problems in someone else than it is in yourself; 
you learn from seeing how other people are reacting to the same difficulties 
you're experiencing," said Judy, who described her ex-husband as a "womanizer." 
</P>
<P>
Most participants are, in DA jargon, the "dumpees" -- spouses who were 
abandoned. And most participants are women. 
</P>
<P>
"We've noticed in the group that the men who are dumped are at first devastated 
but recover a lot faster than the women," said Judy, 56, of Anaheim. "Men tend 
to remarry sooner because there are more single women than single men in the 
over-40 age brackets. Also, women many times have to start over, whereas men 
already have jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Gwen, 48, married her high school sweetheart right after graduation, 
immediately started having children and never pursued a college education. 
"Even talking about having a career of my own was an insult to (her husband); 
it meant that he couldn't take care of his family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Today Gwen temporarily lives with her daughter in Orange while taking college 
classes. "I still don't know the direction to go in," she said. "I need to get 
some kind of training." 
</P>
<P>
On the day her husband left her 2 years ago, Gwen panicked at the thought of 
being alone. "I was obsessing on the fact: How am I going to stay by myself 
tonight?" Gwen recalled. "Now I almost laugh at that." 
</P>
<P>
A rare male participant in Divorce Anonymous, John cautiously waited until age 
34 before marrying last summer. "I didn't take marriage lightly; I really 
thought that I had found the right person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He and his fiancee dated and then lived together for a total of 2 years before 
their marriage. So when he realized her infidelity only a few months after 
their wedding, he "was thrown for a loop." 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a blow," John said. "The marriage meant a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
After spotting a notice for Divorce Anonymous in the newspaper, John 
tentatively attended a meeting. "The first night I went, I didn't say much; I 
just listened," he remembered. "They made me feel welcome, anyway. You don't 
have to talk if you don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
"You begin to open up after a couple of meetings. I thought what happened to me 
must have never happened to anyone else in the entire world, but I learned that 
wasn't true. When I finally told the group about my experience, another man 
said, 'You just described my wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
That feeling of commonality, participants agree, is the magic of Divorce 
Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"Your friends don't know how to react; you get a lot of free advice," John 
said. "But divorce is something you have to go through yourself in order to 
understand everything involved." 
</P>
<P>
"Friends and relatives can listen to you for only so long," Judy said. Divorce 
Anonymous, she said, "is a good place to go to talk things out." 
</P>
<P>
Marge Vinolus, a licensed clinical social worker with Tustin Psychotherapy 
Group, affirmed that the main benefit of a self-help group such as Divorce 
Anonymous is that of camaraderie. "Divorce makes people feel very isolated," 
she observed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to see where you are in the process, compared to where 
other people are. And divorce is a process -- a very long process. Talking with 
others allows you to see that what you're going through -- the loss of 
self-esteem, the grieving -- is normal." 
</P>
<P>
However, she added, discussion groups that are not guided by a professional 
should guard against "focusing only on the negative." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a self-help group can turn into a place where people just sit around 
and rehash how bad they are feeling, which may increase those bad feelings," 
said Vinolus, who specializes in relationship therapy. "At some point, you have 
to move beyond that stage of the process." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, a leader-less group can lend participants a sense of control 
at a time when they have suffered loss of control: "It gives them the 
opportunity to set their own rules." 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Divorce Anonymous offer a harbor for soul-baring, Nancy said, it 
also provides a format for the exchange of practical information. "We recommend 
attorneys to one another -- that sort of thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the situation, John suggested, people should not attempt to tough out 
a divorce in the vacuum of their personal heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk to friends, talk to a clergy, go to Divorce Anonymous meetings," he said. 
"Don't sit around the house dwelling on your problems."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: BIOGRAPHER STRUCK GOLD ON GOLDWYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the start of the 9 years he spent researching and writing about the life of 
legendary Hollywood mogul Samuel Goldwyn, biographer A. Scott Berg was given 
access to an old storage vault in the heart of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For a biographer, Berg told his audience at a book and author luncheon in Costa 
Mesa on Wednesday, opening the door to 60 years' worth of Goldwyn's papers and 
memorabilia was like an archeologist stumbling upon King Tut's tomb. 
</P>
<P>
"As I walked into this tomb, this musty fur vault, I saw nothing but wonderful 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heaped upon dozens of steel file cabinets were reels and reels of old films and 
hundreds of thousands of photographs from Goldywn's films and personal albums, 
which Berg mined for his book, "Goldwyn: A Biography." 
</P>
<P>
Opening file drawers, Berg discovered a telegram from writer Lillian Hellman 
during the blacklist days, thanking Goldwyn for his "very strong position in 
standing up to the rest of the people in town." There were gin rummy IOUs from 
Harpo Marx and a letter from Ronald Coleman shortly after the advent of talking 
pictures, in which the golden-throated actor pleaded: "Please, Mr. Goldwyn, 
don't put me into any talking pictures -- not with my voice." 
</P>
<P>
There was even a menu book kept by Mrs. Goldwyn, in which, after each Hollywood 
party she hosted, she logged what Gary Cooper and other stars ate and drank. 
</P>
<P>
"This," said Berg, "is a biographer's dream, to find this kind of day-to-day 
stuff, the real minutiae that made their lives different from our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a sold-out crowd of 740 gathered in the ballroom of the Red Lion 
Inn for The Times Orange County Edition's second annual Book and Author 
Luncheon, Berg, who spent 2 years sifting through the Goldwyn vault, proved to 
be as gifted a storyteller in person as he is on the printed page. (He was 
joined on the speakers' dais by novelist Amy Tan, whose first novel, "The Joy 
Luck Club," is a national best seller, and Maureen Reagan, who discussed her 
memoir, "First Father, First Daughter.") 
</P>
<P>
In describing the near decade it took him to write his Goldwyn biography, Berg 
said that early on he remembered an important bit of advice he received at 
Princeton from Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker: "People die, papers don't." 
</P>
<P>
Berg, who won a National Book Award for his biography of editor Maxwell Perkins 
a decade ago, said that upon seeing the wealth of Goldwyn documents available 
in the vault, "I remembered these papers are not going to go anywhere. If I 
really want to do this book I should start getting to people who knew Mr. 
Goldwyn himself." 
</P>
<P>
He acted none too soon. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first calls was made to Goldwyn star Merle Oberon, who told him to 
call her after the Christmas holidays. She died on Thanksgiving day. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be ghoulish, Berg said, but he made a list of all the people he wanted 
to interview, and he put them in the order of age -- and health. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sad to say about 60 of the 250 people I interviewed for my book are 
now dead," he said. "But I'm very happy to say, there they are: I talked to 
them. I got their stories. They are in my book. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been most reminded of it this week with the passing of Lucille Ball, who 
became a great friend of this book primarily because her first job in Hollywood 
was as a Goldwyn Girl. And how lucky I was to be able to sit down with this 
Goldwyn Girl and have her tell me what it was like getting on the train in 1932 
(and coming to Hollywood). . . . Great stories for me to take down." 
</P>
<P>
Berg said he spent about 2 years conducting interviews for the book. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, he learned much about Sam Goldwyn, including the fact that when 
Goldwyn, a former glove maker, "jumped into the movie business," the first 
person he went to talk to was Thomas Edison. 
</P>
<P>
And the last phone call Sam Goldwyn received, according to his papers, was from 
Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, that is the history of the movies right there," said Berg. "My God! 
It's all in one place; it's in one life. And I can tell that story." 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, Berg said, he discovered that Samuel Goldwyn really did say 
"Goldwynisms," those "famous fracturings of the English language." 
</P>
<P>
"He did say, I'm happy to report, 'Include me out,' " said Berg, adding that he 
also discovered that half of the so-called Goldwynisms were actually the work 
of Hollywood wags. 
</P>
<P>
"But sure enough," Berg said, "he did say to Danny Kaye, 'Anyone who goes to a 
psychiatrist should have his head examined.' " 
</P>

LAGUNA BEACH HIGH STUDENTS WIN AIDS VIDEO COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students from Laguna Beach High School recently won first place in a local AIDS 
video competition sponsored by KOCE-TV, Channel 50, and the Orange County Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the contest was to help teen-agers learn the facts about AIDS by 
producing information videos. 
</P>
<P>
Serena Kizlty, a junior at Laguna Beach, was producer of the winning video, 
which addressed the issue of AIDS and teen-age pregnancy. Her assistant 
producers were sophomore Silva Sosa and junior Jason Gagnon; the project 
adviser was Jeffrey Hornacek. 
</P>
<P>
Second place went to a team from Foothill High School, whose video attempted to 
make the public aware of what could happen to AIDS victims if something is not 
done immediately to help them. Senior Noah King was the producer. Assistant 
producer was senior Peter Mullen and project adviser was Stephane Zamorano. 
</P>
<P>
Third place also went to Foothill High. Sophomore Jodie Baird was the producer, 
and her assistants were sophomores Marc Danon and Barbra Tibbles. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach will receive $200 in first-place prize money and Foothill will 
receive $200 for its second- and third-place finishes. The students will be 
awarded trophies, plaques and certificates. The winning 1-minute video will air 
on KOCE throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Laguna Beach's winning video will be entered in a national PBS 
AIDS video competition. Three winners from entries submitted by public 
television stations across the country will be selected in June, and the 
winning students will receive an all-expense-paid trip to the 1989 PBS annual 
program fair in Marco Island, Fla. Winning videos will be edited into a 
national PBS program, which will be broadcast later this year. 
</P>
<P>
First-place Bank of America Achievement Awards of $2,000 each were presented to 
Sunny Hills High School student Ronald Strauss in the science and math category 
and Foothill High School student Joanna Brooks in liberal arts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, U.S. teen-agers spent $31.3 billion of their money plus $47.7 billion 
of their parents' money, for a total of $79 billion, according to the recent 
issue of NEA Today, the magazine of the National Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Though the number of teen-agers has been declining since 1975, last year's 
total teen bill was 5.3% more than 1987's and 21.5% more than the 1985 total.

SUNNY HILLS SOPHOMORE VENTURES INTO COMMERCE WITH HELP FROM DAD;

A FUTURE IN BUSINESS APPEARS IN THE CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE LEE, Julie Lee is a junior at Sunny Hills High School, where she is a 
reporter and cartoonist for the Accolade, the student newspaper, and is in the 
Latin and Korean clubs. She enjoys writing stories and poems and hopes to make 
a career in broadcast journalism.

<TEXT>
<P>
All businesses -- no matter how big or small -- start somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jones, a sophomore at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, has been 
building his business, Top Value Trading Cards, for the past year and a half in 
partnership with his father, William Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The two sell baseball trading cards, operating from William Jones' office in 
their Fullerton home. It is a spacious area with a vaulted ceiling and more 
than enough room for a large oak desk and a computer. 
</P>
<P>
"I started Top Value to gain experience in the business field and for the 
future and to have fun at the same time," said Jeff, 16. 
</P>
<P>
He and his father buy boxes of cards at wholesale from the manufacturers and 
then resell them in smaller increments to individual collectors and small 
retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball cards come in complete sets of about 800 -- one for every player and 
manager in the major leagues. Or they come in boxes of 36 packages, each 
containing 15 cards and a piece of gum. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers may order a case of vendors' boxes that contains from 12,000 to 
15,000 cards. Top Value sells them at wholesale prices. But mostly the Joneses 
sell unopened sets directly from the factory. 
</P>
<P>
There's room in the baseball card trading field for small resale businesses 
like Top Value because manufacturers will only sell in major quantities for 
thousands of dollars, and collectors usually only want to buy in small, single 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
Prices depend on the value of the cards themselves -- higher prices for older 
cards, rarer cards and those that are especially popular. A complete set of 
mint cards from the factory can range in price from $18 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff and his father read baseball card magazines and attend card shows to stay 
aware of current prices. They will store some of their inventory for the 
future, when time and scarcity will combine to bring higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad was always interested in starting his own business," Jeff said. "When 
my brother (Greg) started collecting cards, we discovered that his supplier was 
a girl selling cards to pay her way through college. Her business is full time 
now. It just grew and grew. 
</P>
<P>
"We could see the potential there because she wasn't even trying to start a 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff's father supplied the money to purchase the first cards in 1986 and has 
continued to provide capital whenever it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, he had to invest several thousand dollars at a time," Jeff said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now the business is self-supporting. We are even making enough to pay me 
for my work. It's a lot more fun to give up your Saturdays when you're making 
money for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff said he expects his business to triple in profits this year. 
</P>
<P>
To attract customers, Top Value advertises in Baseball Cards magazine, where 
Jeff's self-designed ads list available merchandise and provide purchasing 
information and prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We stress that we're a family business," Jeff said, "that we're not trying to 
make a million dollars but just trying to have fun. We want our customers to 
feel that we care for them personally. We sell to both serious collectors and 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
Top Value has received orders from just about everywhere in the nation, from 
Puerto Rico to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"We even receive letters from little children who address the envelopes in 
crayon." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff's mother, Sandra, takes care of the phone orders during the day, answers 
questions and takes care of the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep five different sizes of boxes, tape and shipping labels in the garage. 
Storage is a real problem," said Jeff, estimating that they keep "hundreds of 
thousands" of cards on hand. 
</P>
<P>
William Jones helped to set up the database that lets the family keep track of 
customers and shipments, but Jeff maintains all the records. He is also 
responsible for handling the correspondence, depositing the money in the bank, 
designing the price lists and preparing the cards for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to do with sports, homework, church activities and being 
photographer for Accolade (the Sunny Hills newspaper)," Jeff said. 
</P>
<P>
But he believes the business is worth it. "I think it will help me get into 
college," he said. "How many applicants will have their own businesses?" 
</P>
<P>
Jeff said he has learned a lot about baseball cards, balancing a checkbook, 
registering a business with the courts and handling phone orders and general 
correspondence. But most especially, he has learned about running a business. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go into business some day," he said, "and my dad and I feel this is 
a good steppingstone."

FBI TOLD TO REDO SYSTEM OF PROMOTION; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE ACTS AFTER TRIAL THAT FOUND BIAS AGAINST LATINO AGENTS

<P>
A federal judge today ordered changes in the way the FBI promotes its minority 
agents, calling the promotional method now "unsystematic and excessively 
subjective." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton's order abolished the ability of the bureau's 
special agents in charge to arbitrarily determine who is promoted. 
</P>
<P>
Bunton called the system under which the special agents can disregard the 
recommendation of a career review board an "anathema to nearly every reform 
advanced by the bureau" and ordered the agency "to improve the fairness and 
reviewability of an accessibly subjective promotional process." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Embarrassment 
</P>
<P>
After a two-week, non-jury trial last summer, Bunton found that the FBI had 
discriminated against Latino agents in promotions, discipline and assignments. 
It was a major embarrassment for the FBI, which investigates civil rights 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Latino agents had asked for back pay, but Bunton declined to order any monetary 
damages in announcing his ruling. However, he ordered the appointment of a 
three-member panel to examine on an individual basis the plaintiff agents' 
request for promotions they claim they have been denied as a result of the 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Bunton ordered that original plaintiff Bernardo M. (Mat) Perez be promoted to 
the next job level in the bureau within 45 days and that the bureau must "make 
available to Perez responsibilities commensurate with his experience and 
training." 
</P>
<P>
Also, FBI Director Williams S. Sessions must report to the court every 90 days 
regarding promotional decisions about Perez until he becomes a special agent in 
charge or attains a similar position of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Bunton praised the efforts made by the FBI since it was found guilty in 
September of discriminating against Latino agents. 
</P>
<P>
"The bureau has taken significant steps since the date of the trial to correct 
the disparate conditions of employment," Bunton said in the opinion. But he 
stressed that reforms made so far do not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said Bunton's decision could have a ripple effect on how other 
U.S. law enforcement agencies award promotions and hand out assignments. Latino 
agents of the U.S. Border Patrol and Customs Service have discussed filing 
suits similar to the FBI case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
310 Join Suit 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit was filed in January, 1987, by Perez, then the No. 2 man 
in El Paso and the FBI's highest-ranking Latino agent. Eventually, 310 of the 
FBI's approximately 400 Latino agents joined Perez in the suit. The FBI has 
about 9,000 agents. 
</P>
<P>
Perez filed the suit after a demotion and a series of humiliating actions. He 
was agent in charge of the San Juan, Puerto Rico, office when he was demoted 
and sent to be assistant agent in charge in Los Angeles.

BUSH, KOHL FAIL TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES ON NUCLEAR FORCES

President Bush and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl held a telephone 
conversation today but failed to resolve their differences over East-West 
negotiations on short-range nuclear forces, White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not appear that a basis for agreement is there, but we'll continue to 
discuss it and see," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He described the 20-minute conversation, initiated by Kohl, as "productive, 
cordial, but also direct," using diplomatic language implying that differences 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not characterize it as moving the situation one way or another, except 
in terms of understanding" each other's position, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl wants NATO to accept a Soviet proposal for early talks on short-range 
nuclear forces -- missiles with a range of less than 300 miles -- but the 
United States and Britain say such negotiations should not take place until 
there is an agreement to reduce the Warsaw Pact's advantage in conventional 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in our position," Fitzwater said. "We still believe early 
negotiations" with the Soviet Union on reducing short-range nuclear weapons 
"would be a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the United States would like to resolve the problem before the 
NATO summit starts May 29 in Brussels, "but if we can't, it's not the end of 
the world."

Milad Anton Shahin was taken to East Jerusalem's Mokassed Hospital and

<P>
Unemployment, rising at the fastest clip in more then three years, jumped to 
5.3% last month, the strongest evidence yet of an economic slowdown, the 
government said today in a report greeted with mixed reactions in financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street stocks initially staged a powerful rally, than sank abruptly in the 
final hour on futures-related trading and uncertainty over the unemployment 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 2.94 points at 2,381.96,after being 
up by as much as 25 points. Rises led falls by about 4-3 on moderate New York 
Stock Exchange volume of 180.812 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Propelling the 0.3 percentage point gain in the jobless rate was the smallest 
rise in new jobs since June, 1986, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment increase was the biggest one-month gain since February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Economists and financial markets, concerned for months that the persistently 
heady economy was moving into a period of spiraling price hikes, initially 
found mostly good news in the report. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts wondered whether the dramatic increase in joblessness was 
signaling that the danger now is one not of inflation but of recession. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Brinner of DRI-McGraw-Hill said the data was "about perfect" for 
prospects of generating a soft landing for the soaring economy -- slowing 
growth just enough to rein in inflation without triggering a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question the economy is weakening," said Washington economist 
Michael Evans. "But there's nothing in this report to suggest we are heading 
into a recession." 
</P>
<P>
Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. was more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted a mild recession later this year and said the economy was 
"downshifting to slower growth. This is part and parcel of the bloom being off 
the rose of what has been a booming economy." 
</P>
<P>
Economists concurred that today's surprising jump in the unemployment rate will 
likely be enough to keep the Federal Reserve Board from further tightening 
credit when it next reevaluates monetary policy in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White House Optimistic 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater played down the significance of the 
first rise in unemployment of George Bush's brief tenure as President, noting 
that the percentage of working-age Americans with jobs "remains at al all-time 
high of 63.3%." 
</P>
<P>
April's rise in the jobless rate was felt most heavily by men. The unemployment 
rate among white men rose from 3.6% to 4.0%; for Hispanic men, from 6.5% to 
8.3%; for black men, from 9.8% to 10.0%. 
</P>
<P>
Joblessness among white women rose from 3.8% to 4.1%, but dropped for black 
women from 9.1% to 8.8%. 
</P>
<P>
As for job growth last month, a separate department survey of businesses found 
that only 117,000 non-farm payroll jobs were created. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Labor Department revised payroll growth for March 
downward from 180,000 to 171,000. Over the 12-month period that ended in 
February, an average of 300,000 jobs had been created each month.

President Bush has not discussed the question of whether to pardon Oliver 
North, Bush's spokesman said today, a day after the former White House aide was 
convicted on felony counts in connection with the Iran-Contra case. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I haven't discussed it with anybody,' " White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, recounting the President's reply when 
Fitzwater asked him about a pardon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater refused any further comment on the North verdict or trial documents 
that appeared to indicate Bush was involved in a Reagan Administration plan to 
make a quid pro quo arrangement with Honduras in return for its assistance to 
the rebels in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the appropriate congressional committees will be briefed on 
confidential cables that described Bush's activities in that regard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
52% Favor a Pardon 
</P>
<P>
At a photo session in the Oval Office, the President personally took the same 
approach as Fitzwater, refusing any comment on the conviction or on the pardon 
issue just one day after he said the verdict had freed him to answer other 
questions that arose during North's trial about his own actions when he was 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
A poll released today by USA Today found a majority of Americans, 52% to 36%, 
believe North should be pardoned. The survey of 814 people also found 72% 
agreed that he was a "fall guy" for other government officials in the scandal; 
only 21% agreed that he was a "loose cannon." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House investigating committee, 
said on NBC's "Today" this morning that "this is not an instance where a 
presidential pardon is appropriate, nor is it an instance where he should have 
an extended sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said on CBS' "This Morning" that while he opposes a 
pardon, the commutation of a prison sentence would be "totally appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Marine Corps said today it was being flooded with telephone 
complaints from Americans over an announcement that North, now a convicted 
felon, will lose his $1,900 monthly pension. 
</P>
<P>
"My head hurts," Capt. Liz Kerstens, a Marine Corps spokeswoman at the Pentagon 
said. "We have been getting calls from all over the country complaining that we 
are unfair." 
</P>
<P>
But Marine Corps officials said earlier that, under federal law, North was 
required to give up his pension after his conviction Thursday.

Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said today that Palestinians 
should kill Americans and other Westerners in retaliation for attacks by the 
Israeli military in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
"If in retaliation for every Palestinian martyred in Palestine, they will kill 
and execute, not inside Palestine, five Americans or Britons or Frenchmen, they 
(Israelis) could not continue these wrongs," Rafsanjani was quoted as saying by 
the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not hard to kill Americans or Frenchmen. It is a bit difficult to kill 
(Israelis). But there are so many (Americans and French) everywhere in the 
world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
480 Deaths 
</P>
<P>
At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the 17-month-old 
Palestinian uprising against Israeli in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which 
Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. 
</P>
<P>
IRNA said Rafsanjani spoke at a prayer sermon today in Tehran before huge 
rallies to mark an Iranian holiday in support of the Palestinian cause. 
</P>
<P>
IRNA said Rafsanjani also encouraged Palestinians to hijack planes to force 
Israel to release prisoners and to blow up factories in Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani criticized PLO leader Yasser Arafat for renouncing terrorism and 
recognizing Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
He also brushed aside Western reaction to his support for violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they will start saying that so and so, as a man in charge, and as the 
speaker of Parliament has officially called for acts of terror. . . . But let 
them say it. . . . Aren't they saying it now?

Britain expelled three South African diplomats today because of their country's 
reputed role in a plot to sell arms to Northern Ireland extremists in exchange 
for British-made missile parts. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said Undersecretary Patrick Wright summoned South African 
Ambassador Rae Killen and told him the three must leave the country within a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"We noted their expression of regret," a statement quoted Wright as telling 
Killen. "However, the South African government should be under no illusions 
about the grave concern with which Her Majesty's government viewed the 
involvement by South African officials in this affair." 
</P>
<P>
The move came two weeks after authorities in Paris arrested a South African 
diplomat, an American arms dealer and three members of an extreme Protestant 
organization in Northern Ireland. The Northern Irish allegedly were handing 
over parts of a Blowpipe, a sophisticated shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missile 
manufactured in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
The British government expressed grave concern over allegations that the South 
Africans were supplying weapons to the Protestants in exchange for the missile 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
The South African, identified by French sources as Daniel Storm, was released 
after he claimed diplomatic immunity.

The study of an obscure wild Brazilian tomato has led scientists to the 
discovery of a treatment that doubles the keeping time of some commercially 
grown tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's $1-billion fresh tomato industry could realize dramatic benefits 
from the new process, said Peter J. Davies, a plant physiology professor at 
Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornell treatment process increases the shelf-life of vine-ripened tomatoes 
to 10 to 12 days, said David M. Law, a research associate on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The method involves increasing the level of a chemical compound, called 1,4 
butanediamine, already found naturally in the tomato. The process is now being 
tested by a food company to determine whether it is viable on a large scale.

INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE FUND TO SAVE OZONE GETS LUKEWARM RECEPTION

Eighty countries considering ways of saving the Earth's protective ozone layer 
backed away today from a plan to set up an international climate fund. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme was put forward at a U.N.-sponsored conference by Mostafa Tolba, 
head of the U.N. Environment Program, and supported by delegates from 
developing countries. Its intention was to help poorer countries phase out 
damaging chemicals without hindering their economic development. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was rejected by several industrialized countries, such as Britain and 
the United States, which said they preferred to use existing aid arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Tolba had sought a clear commitment to a fund, but delegates agreed instead to 
set up a working group to consider ways of helping developing countries. The 
fund idea has not been entirely ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalist groups accused the meeting of sidestepping important issues 
and of delaying decisions that could affect the future of humanity.

Reed International said today that it has agreed to buy the worldwide travel 
and electronic publishing divisions of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for $825 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, a London-based publisher of travel information in Asia and Europe through 
its ABC International subsidiary, said the acquisition, subject to shareholder 
approval, would give it a stake in the fast-growing U.S. travel market. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for News Corp. said cash from the sale of the divisions, including 
the flagship Hotel &amp; Travel Index, would be used to reduce debt associated 
with the company's $3-billion takeover last year of Triangle Publications Inc., 
the parent company of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp.'s travel group is made up of six directories and two periodicals. 
The company's electronic publishing division includes a hotel and airline 
reservation system.

CINEPLEX ODEON PUTS OFF SHAREHOLDER MEETING TILL JUNE 6

Embattled Cineplex Odeon Corp. said today that it has postponed its annual 
shareholders meeting until June 6, a delay of nearly a month. 
</P>
<P>
The move from May 9 will give the company time to inform shareholders about 
"certain events" that have happened since the original meeting circular was 
mailed out, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Cineplex Chairman Garth Drabinsky may be trying to raise 
more than $664 million to buy outstanding shares and overall control of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Drabinsky last week called a truce in his bitter battle with Los Angeles-based 
MCA Inc., a major shareholder, that was sparked by his attempt to buy a 
controlling interest in Cineplex.

Oil prices, recovering early this year from a supply glut, have strengthened 
further after recent accidents in the North Sea and the Alaskan oil spill, the 
industrialized world's energy watchdog said today. 
</P>
<P>
The International Energy Agency said in its monthly survey that although OPEC 
supplied an estimated 700,000 barrels per day more oil in April than in March, 
the West's own output shrank by a total 100,000 barrels a day over the month. 
</P>
<P>
An explosion on a key platform in the North Sea on April 18 stopped pumping of 
almost 500,000 barrels per day of gasoline-rich British crude, a quarter of the 
country's already much-reduced output. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline that passes through this pumping platform may not resume normal 
production for several more weeks.

<P>
Personal income is growing at an uneven pace in America's cities, with the 
fastest growth along the East Coast and the slowest in oil-producing states, a 
new government report shows. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of the nation's 318 metropolitan areas in 1987 registered per 
capita income growth at least 2 percentage points above the national average of 
6%, the Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of those cities were in New England; six were in the Middle Atlantic 
region; five were in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil-Producing States 
</P>
<P>
Income in 60 metropolitan areas, meanwhile, grew at a rate that was at least 2 
percentage points below the national average. Forty-one of those areas were in 
the oil-producing states of Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of growth in New England is driven by services and high-tech 
industries," said Kathy Albetski of the department's Bureau of Economic 
Analysis. "The slow growth was driven by the weakness in oil." 
</P>
<P>
The fastest growth rate was recorded in the Visalia-Tulare-Porterville region 
of California, but that was largely because incomes there were relatively low 
to begin with. The area's per capita income rose 9.7% to $12,968, a level still 
well below the national average. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale, two regions registered declines in 1987: Per 
capita income fell 1.4% in Flint, Mich., to $14,723, and dropped 0.6% in 
Lafayette, La., to $12,363. 
</P>
<P>
In a ranking of income levels, first place belonged to the 
Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury area of Connecticut, with per capita income 
of $26,316. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing up the rear was the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area of Texas at $7,001. 
</P>
<P>
For the nation as a whole, per capita income in 1987 was $15,484, up from 
$14,609 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Bridgeport region, here are the other metropolitan areas in 
the top 10 for 1987 per capita personal income: 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, $24,593; Bergen-Passaic, N.J., $23,040; 
Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J., $22,783; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., $22,001; 
Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia, $21,539; San Jose, $21,510; Anaheim-Santa 
Ana, $21,444; Lake County, Ill., $21,432, and West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray 
Beach, Fla., $21,246. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the McAllen region, here are the other metropolitan areas in the 
bottom 10 for 1987 per capita personal income: 
</P>
<P>
Laredo, Tex., $7,035; Brownsville-Harlingen, Tex., $7,409; Provo-Orem, Utah, 
$8,870; El Paso, Tex., $9,484; Las Cruces, N.M., $9,578; Pascagoula, Miss., 
$10,231; Houma-Thibodaux, La., $10,582; Jacksonville, N.C., $10,668, and 
Bryan-College Station, Tex., $10,688.

Trevor Berbick, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, was found not 
guilty of sexually assaulting a Halifax teen-ager in her parents' house four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In handing down his verdict Thursday, Judge Felix Cacchione said he did not 
find the teen-ager, now 19, a credible witness. There were too many 
inconsistencies in her testimony, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Berbick, 36, who once lived in Nova Scotia and now lives in Florida, said he is 
relieved by the decision. But he said the court case robbed him of his 
concentration and cost him millions of dollars in potential fight earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican-born boxer won the WBC heavyweight title in 1986 but lost it a 
year later to Mike Tyson.

<TEXT>
<P>
Top-seeded Steffi Graf cruised into the semifinals of the $200,000 Virginia 
Slims women's tennis tournament today with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Rachel McQuillan 
of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the top-ranked woman player in the world, struggled in her opening 
tournament match Thursday against Nicole Jagerman of the Netherlands. But 
today, the West German needed only 50 minutes to dispatch the unseeded 
Australian on the slow clay court. 
</P>
<P>
Watched by Alexander Mronz, a West German tennis player reported by Hamburg 
newspapers to be her boyfriend, Graf unleashed her full range of shots against 
McQuillan. 
</P>
<P>
McQuillan, ranked 127th in the world, tried to counter by rushing to the net 
but found herself constantly passed by Graf's nearly error-free game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good opportunity to practice a few shots before the upcoming 
tournaments in West Berlin and Paris," said Graf, who is trying to repeat her 
Grand Slam triumph of last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not playing yet the way I want, but it went well today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's semifinals, Graf is to meet Bettina Fulco of Argentina, who 
ousted Nathalie Tauziat of France 7-5, 7-6. 
</P>

In Munich, meanwhile, Stefan Edberg crushed Alberto Mancini's hopes of winning 
his second consecutive clay-court tournament, defeating the 19-year-old 
Argentine 7-6, 6-2 today for a semifinal spot in the $205,000 Bavarian Open. 
</P>
<P>
There was another setback for Argentina when Guillermo Perez-Roldan, last 
year's Munich champion, was ousted by Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov, winner at Nice two weeks ago, outlasted the Argentine 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the Wimbledon champion, routed Mancini in the second set after winning 
the first-set tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, a clay court specialist who beat Boris Becker for the Monte Carlo Open 
title last week, had no answer to Edberg's textbook serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
"If I keep playing like this, I think I can win this tournament," said Edberg, 
who is playing his first clay court event of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's semifinal opponent will be Martin Strelba of Czechoslovakia, who 
prevented an all-Swedish encounter by upsetting Jonas Svensson 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union was assured of having one player in the final when Alexander 
Volkov beat Javier Sanchez of Spain 6-2, 6-4. Volkov plays his countryman 
Chesnokov in the semifinals.

DEFECTING SOVIET HOCKEY PLAYER IN U.S.;

<P>
Alexander Mogilny, on the verge of stardom with the Soviet world championship 
team, flew to the United States today for what he hoped would be a career in 
the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival from Stockholm, the Soviet athlete was interviewed at 
John F. Kennedy Airport by the FBI, according to an airport spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"They do that with all defectors," said Tom Middlemiss of the Port Authority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sabres Own Rights 
</P>
<P>
Middlemiss said Mogilny was accompanied on the flight by officials of the 
Buffalo Sabres, adding that he did not know which ones. The Sabres own NHL 
rights to the player. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Mogilny, who helped the Soviet Union to its 21st 
world hockey title last week, was granted a U.S. visa Thursday. He reportedly 
planned to fly to Buffalo, N.Y., after clearing customs. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL was getting ready for Mogilny, but a spokesman said he had no 
information "at this present moment" whether the Sabres had offered the Soviet 
player a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We are collecting all the facts regarding Mogilny leaving his team and also 
awaiting advice from United States State Department and the Canadian Department 
of External Affairs as to what effect, if any, his military position places on 
the situation, vis-a-vis his ability to settle in either country and travel 
back and forth," said Gary Meagher, the NHL's director of media relations, in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny is a junior lieutenant in the Soviet Army. That adds a further 
diplomatic complication: Soviet authorities could view the incident as 
desertion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INS Comment Declined 
</P>
<P>
The regional director of the Immigration of Naturalization Service in Buffalo, 
Benedict Ferro, said his office is aware of the situation, but he declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably it would be through the immigration service in Buffalo that efforts 
would be made to grant Mogilny permission to live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The defection, the first by a Soviet national hockey player, cast a shadow on 
U.S.-Soviet hockey relations and gave an ironic twist to the latest Soviet 
championship.
