IRWINDALE FILES NEW LAWSUIT AGAINST EX-CITY CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite some conciliatory talk by city officials last week, the city of 
Irwindale has filed another lawsuit against Fred Lyte, its former redevelopment 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed in Pomona Superior Court, the city contends that Lyte 
"fraudulently (concealed) material facts about a development project . . . 
which otherwise would have been rejected" in order to collect an extra fee 
under his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also charged Lyte with trying to disrupt the city's negotiations with 
the Los Angeles Raiders to build a $150-million football stadium in Irwindale 
by spreading rumors and making false charges. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte, part of the negotiating team that produced the initial accord with the 
Raiders, characterized the suit this week as "pure baloney, tailored to harass 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Since the City Council dismissed the consultant last December, the city has 
widely accused him of creating discord in Irwindale and blocked payment of more 
than $1 million in bills he has submitted to the city. Irwindale has also filed 
a lawsuit seeking more than $2 million in damages, claiming that Lyte had 
violated a provision in his contract forbidding him to recommend to the city 
projects in which he had a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
In a bitter exchange with Irwindale officials last month, Lyte charged that the 
first suit "will be laughed out of court" because he was never a city employee. 
The laws that define conflict of interest may not apply to him, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The new legal action centers on the creation of a strip mall two years ago at 
the intersection of Irwindale Avenue and Arrow Highway, a block from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint against Lyte, the Hopkins Development Co. had agreed 
to build a shopping center on a two-acre lot on Arrow, but only if an adjacent 
7,000-square-foot lot at the southeast corner of the busy intersection could be 
included in the package. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller lot, with a 50-foot frontage on Irwindale Avenue, is owned by 
Irwindale Mayor Patricio Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint against Lyte, Miranda had refused to lease the 
property to Hopkins because his constituents would perceive such an arrangement 
by a city official as a conflict of interest. Following the advice of Martin, 
Miranda "would not lease or sell his land to any party who would be involved in 
the shopping center development," the complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
But principals of Hopkins, the development company, three years ago formed a 
general partnership and negotiated a lease with Miranda. The complaint says 
Miranda did not know that he was dealing with a Hopkins subsidiary, and Lyte 
withheld that information in order to collect a 3% fee for bringing a new 
development to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda's property, once the site of Miranda's taco stand, now holds a 
Jack-in-the-Box outlet that shares a parking lot with a 10-store strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
"The city did not discover the true facts relating to Lyte's fraudulent 
concealment of information or breach of fiduciary duty until April, 1989," the 
complaint says. 
</P>

LIGHT AT END OF TUNNEL; 
</P>
<P>
SUBWAY DIGGERS BREAK THROUGH TO FIRST STATION ON THE RED LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As breakthroughs go, it didn't sound or look like much. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was a gentle scraping noise as the digging apparatus -- sort of 
like a 
</P>
<P>
backhoe -- began clawing away from the other side at the last foot or so of 
earth that separated the unseen tunnelers from the vast, subterranean cavern 
where contractors, transit officials and news reporters waited. 
</P>
<P>
Then a little clump of dirt fell through, and you could see the light from the 
other side. The machine clawed away a little more dirt, enlarging the hole to 
perhaps eight feet in diameter, and about a dozen tunnelers crawled through to 
get their pictures taken. 
</P>
<P>
It was about 9:15 a.m. Friday, and they were the first men to travel from one 
station to another on Los Angeles' new Metro Red Line subway system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1st Complete Segment 
</P>
<P>
Their journey -- in work cars and on foot -- marked the completion of digging 
for the first of two, parallel, 4,000-foot tunnels that eventually will carry 
subway passengers between the line's eastern terminus, at Union Station, and 
its first intermediate station, at the Civic Center. Work on the second tunnel 
between the two stations is scheduled to start soon. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the first 4.4 miles of the system -- already postponed twice -- 
currently is expected in September, 1993, according to Rapid Transit District 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The tunneling efforts are about one-third complete. However, work on the five 
underground stations for the first $1.25-billion phase of the subway program is 
still in the early stages. The breakthrough Friday morning was at the Civic 
Center station, which lies under Hill Street, between Temple and 1st streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Hole 
</P>
<P>
It's still basically just a hole, covered by massive wooden timbers supporting 
the surface traffic that still rumbles along Hill Street. But it's a vast hole 
-- 590 feet long, 65 feet wide and 85 feet deep -- larger, engineers say, than 
most of the government buildings that surround it. 
</P>
<P>
Massive steel-reinforced concrete columns are being poured to support the upper 
three levels of the four-level station, and tunneling gear is being moved into 
place for the twin shafts that will push south on Hill Street to the next 
station down the line, the one under construction at Pershing Square.

SINGING THE PRAISES OF SCHOLASTIC GLORY;

<P>
TAFT RALLY HAILS NATIONAL CHAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taft High School senior Michael Pocrass, the quietest member of the school's 
national champion academic decathlon team, sat alone for just a minute amid a 
storm of noise Friday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 students were whooping it up on the school's lawn as the 
marching band played, and a helicopter carrying Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 
buzzed the Woodland Hills campus before landing on a nearby athletic field. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we worked for, all the attention," said Pocrass, smiling and 
staring out over the crowded Taft campus, decorated with banners and balloons. 
Pocrass and his eight teammates waited on a platform for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what we expected, what we hoped for," Pocrass said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard Work 'Worth It' 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Sim, the other quiet member of the group, later told the assembled 
crowd that the hard work preparing for the academic decathlon "was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Forget the quiet anonymity associated with the work of academicians. Some of 
these scholars are going on "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
The letter from President Bush congratulating the Taft team is nice enough, but 
"we're seeing about getting them an invitation to the White House," said Ann 
Joynt, U.S. Academic Decathlon executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team's quick rise to celebrity after the announcement Monday that its 
members had won the U.S. Academic Decathlon, beating teams from 36 states and 
two foreign countries, has left little time for reflection or much else. 
Pocrass' own moment was soon interrupted by a request for still another 
television interview. Teammates say they've skipped a lot of classes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very smooth transition for me personally to celebrityhood," said 
Taft team member Rodney Crump. "They're coming for us with a limousine today to 
do 'The Tonight Show.' It feels good." 
</P>
<P>
Crump and teammates Marc Sarti and Lisa Demsky were picked by producers of "The 
Tonight Show" to appear on Friday's show and compete in a mini-quiz contest 
against host Johnny Carson and sidekick Ed McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty nervous" about appearing on national television, said Demsky, a 
student body officer and senior class valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
Demsky's mother, Ellen, said invitations and phone calls have poured in nonstop 
since the group arrived back in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hour With Reagan 
</P>
<P>
The team spent an hour Thursday with former President Ronald Reagan in his 
Century City office. "He was friendly and spent most of the time advocating the 
American way, and he looked good," said Shawn Canter. 
</P>
<P>
Team coach and English teacher Arthur Berchin said he has not yet decided 
whether to continue coaching the academic decathlon program. But he said 30 
students are seeking spots on next year's team. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was joined in congratulating the Taft team by school district Supt. 
Leonard M. Britton, school board member Julie Korenstein, who represents the 
west San Fernando Valley, and United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"You are role models," Bradley said. He advised the students at the assembly to 
savor the moment and then continue their work in school. 
</P>
<P>
The decathlon team members, in addition to certificates and plaques, were given 
$100 savings bonds from a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Taft team finished second in the national contest. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between coming in first and coming in second is that last year 
we arrived at LAX to an empty terminal," Berchin said. "This time we got off 
the plane, and there were what looked like hundreds of people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

MAN SENTENCED TO PRISON TERM FOR ROBBING, BEATING FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last of three defendants convicted of attacking and robbing a Van Nuys 
family has been sentenced to 11 years and four months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles on Thursday imposed the maximum 
sentence on Loushawn Boujay Irving, 20, of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Irving and two other men, wearing ski masks and armed with 
shotguns, broke into the apartment of Ken and Yvette Kingsberry about 2 a.m. 
April 18, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The three men beat Ken Kingsberry, 27, with the butt of a shotgun, knocking out 
several front teeth. During the scuffle, the men kicked and pushed Kingsberry's 
22-year-old wife, who was nine months pregnant at the time, and threatened to 
take the couple's year-old son, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
After ransacking the apartment, the men fled with $5,800 in cash and some 
jewelry. They were caught by police minutes later near the apartment complex in 
the 14500 block of Vose Street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the defendants told police that the robbery was in retaliation for Ken 
Kingsberry stealing his car a year earlier. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin 
D'Agostino said the victims did not know any of the men arrested in the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no provocation whatsoever" for the robbery, D'Agostino said. Rather, 
she said, the defendants somehow knew that the Kingsberrys had just sold a car 
and had money in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Malkin Harris, 22, was sentenced earlier to 11 years and four months in state 
prison. Andre Hill, 21, was sentenced to 10 years and four months in prison in 
connection with the incident, authorities said.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISSING CANOGA PARK GIRL FOUND UNHARMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amissing 7-year-old Canoga Park girl was found unharmed Friday when she arrived 
at school, saying she had spent the night with a friend after missing her 
school bus Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators searched all night for Ruth Noemy Ayala, a student at Melvin 
Street School in Canoga Park, after the girl's father reported her missing 
Thursday evening, Los Angeles Police Detective Stan Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The child told authorities that she missed the bus that takes her from her 
school to Canoga Park School, where her father picks her up. Ruth, who came 
from Guatemala three months ago, said she could not reach her parents because 
she did not know her phone number or address, Miller said. So she went home 
with a classmate for the night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they confirmed the story with the classmate's family and 
returned Ruth to her parents Friday morning.

RECOVERED OR RECOVERING: THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, it has happened again. There was another story of how an athlete has 
overcome his drug and alcohol addiction to once again perform up to his 
"potential." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't too long ago that The Times featured Houston McTear and how well he 
was doing. But when he was arrested and charged with drug possession, there 
were only a couple of lines. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is this story about Orlando Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that all of these people really do make it on their roads to recovery, 
but doesn't the newspaper do them a big disservice and put pressure on them by 
saying that they have recovered? 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that they are only recovering.

 Editor's note: In neither the McTear story nor the Woolridge story did The 
Times say, or even suggest, that either athlete was recovered from his drug 
problem, only that each was trying to deal with it. The Times, too, hopes that 
those with drug problems really do make it on their roads to recovery but is 
not so naive as to believe that they are anything more than recovering.

CHRIS MULLIN IS HARDLY A 'POOR MAN'S' BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My only complaint about Mark Heisler's welcome article on Golden State Coach 
Don Nelson was the reference to Chris Mullin as being a "poor man's Larry 
Bird." To call him that is unfair to Mullin, who may not win most improved 
player of the year because of his past problems, but he easily wins most 
improved man in my book. 
</P>
<P>
And don't be too surprised if Mullin should one day play for Boston after the 
Bird flies into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
I can hear the Los Angeles sportswriters cussing old Red Auerbach right now.

FTOREK GETS PRAISE FOR SHOWING CLASS

I was never a fan of Coach Robbie Ftorek, but I think he should be very proud

that watching the Kings this season was absolutely wonderful.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CHANGING THE NAME ON U.S. SAVINGS BOND IS A 
FAIRLY EASY PROCEDURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Several years ago, my husband received a chain letter directing him 
to send a $50 U.S. savings bond to the person at the top of the list. Not 
understanding the deception of this scheme, my husband bought the bond. But he 
never mailed it. Now we are wondering if we can change the name on the bond to 
our name so we can cash it in. How can we do this? -- L. G. P. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: First of all, the Bureau of the Public Debt takes an exceedingly dim 
view of chain letter schemes involving savings bonds. In fact, if the bureau's 
bureaucrats find out that the reason you need to change the name on a bond is 
because you were ready to get involved in such a scheme, you will be forced to 
forfeit any interest the bond has accumulated while you've held it. However, 
you are entitled to a refund of the amount you paid for the bond. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are many reasons why someone might want to change a name or 
cash in a bond he is holding. For example, one common reason is that the 
purchaser intended to give the bond as a gift but later changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The government has two separate forms for changing names on savings bonds, one 
for people who want to confess their involvement -- or potential involvement -- 
in a chain letter and one for all others. In the first instance, you should 
request the "Special Bond of Indemnity to the United States of America," Bureau 
of the Public Debt Form 2966. You may obtain it from the bureau's Division of 
Transactions and Rulings, 200 Third St., Parkersberg, Va. 26101. Complete the 
form as instructed and return it, and the government will get back in touch 
with you. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if you simply want to cash in a bond you intended to give someone else as 
a gift, contact your local Federal Reserve Bank or branch and ask for the form 
titled "Request for Refund of Purchase." Complete it and follow the other 
instructions and you will be entitled to receive a refund of the amount you 
paid for the bond, plus any accumulated interest. The local branch for Southern 
California is at 950 S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles, Calif. 90015. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forming Partnerships to Buy Treasury Bills 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to join with three other investors and purchase 
large-denomination U.S. Treasury notes. However, my broker says he can accept 
only one taxpayer identification number on the purchase. How can all four of us 
handle our separate tax responsibilities for the interest these notes pay if 
there is only one tax ID number? Also, where can I reach the Assn. of 
Individual Investors? -- J. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: There are two fairly easy solutions to your first question. The simplest is 
to form an investment partnership among the four of you and use the taxpayer 
identification number assigned to the partnership for your purchases. The terms 
of the partnership will spell out how the interest is to be divided. The four 
investors should report their individual shares of the interest payments on 
their personal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The other solution is for the partners to agree on a "manager" whose Social 
Security number would be used for the purchases. This person would be 
responsible for reporting the entire interest payment on his tax return and 
showing how it was distributed to each of his investment partners. Each partner 
would then report his share of the interest on his tax return. For example, 
let's say the group of four equal partners received $500 in a given year. The 
manager would report that $500 on his tax return and then list the names and 
Social Security numbers of his three partners who each received a $125 share of 
the interest. Those three partners would be responsible for reporting the 
receipt of $125 in interest from Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. of Individual Investors is at 625 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, 
Ill. 60611. The telephone number is (312) 280-0170. The association, a 
nonprofit educational group, publishes each year 10 investment journals, a 
guide to taxes and a guide to no-load mutual funds. The membership fee is $49 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Tax Rules on Stock Distributions 
</P>
<P>
Q: I work for a large public company and have participated in the savings plan 
for the last 30 years. When I retire I will receive a lump-sum distribution of 
those savings in the form of stock in the company. I am wondering about the tax 
consequences of this. Specifically, how do you treat the unrealized gain -- the 
amount the stock has grown in value -- when you get the distribution? Can you 
explain? -- N. M. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: First of all, we have to assume that the savings plan that you have been a 
part of is what the government terms a "qualified plan." This is very likely 
the case, but you should check just to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are special rules that address the issues of price appreciation for 
lump-sum distributions made in the form of shares of stock. If your 
distribution was all cash, you would be subject to taxes on the entire 
distribution, the amount you put in as well as the amount the contribution had 
generated in interest over the years. With stock, however, you are taxed at 
distribution only on the purchase price value of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
For example, let's say you had bought $10,000 worth of stock over the years, 
and those shares were now worth $50,000 at distribution. You would be taxed 
immediately on the $10,000 when you receive the distribution. You will be taxed 
on the remaining value of the stock when you sell it, an amount that may be 
higher or lower than the stock's value on the day you actually receive it. 
</P>
<P>
If you choose to sell the shares immediately after receiving them, you can 
invoke either the five- or 10-year "forward averaging" provision in the tax 
code, which essentially allows you to treat the one-time gain as though it were 
received over several years, thus reducing the tax bite. To invoke the more 
favorable 10-year-averaging provision, you must have turned age 50 by Jan. 1, 
1986. If you turn 50 after that date, then you may average the gain over just 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treasury Bill Interest Is Directly Deposited 
</P>
<P>
Q: Not to belabor the Treasury bill matter, but I have one more question that I 
haven't been able to get an answer for. How does the government pay interest on 
longer-term securities, such as 10- and 20-year notes? Do I get monthly or 
quarterly interest payments? Is it sent directly to me? -- J. Z. 
</P>
<P>
A: Interest on Treasury notes -- securities held for one year or longer -- is 
deposited directly into a checking or savings account of your choice twice a 
year. You designate the account to receive the direct deposit when you open 
your account with the Treasury Department.

EARLY RALLY LOSES STEAM; DOW OFF 2.94

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blue chip stocks shot up Friday morning, buoyed by news of slower job growth 
last month, but later lost the rally on a wave of program selling amid fears of 
a possible recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 2.94 points at 2,381.96, ending the 
week with a 36.84-point loss and extending a losing streak to six days. But the 
broader market ended higher. Advances led declines 796 to 609 in active New 
York Stock Exchange volume of 180.81 million shares. Volume was 816.24 million 
shares for the week. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks took off from the opening bell, gaining as much as 30 points after the 
government said the jobless rate rose to 5.3% last month from March's 15-year 
low of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Investors initially welcomed the report's implication that the economy may be 
cooling and easing upward pressure on inflation and interest rates, but anxiety 
set in as the market grappled with fears of an impending recession. 
</P>
<P>
Investors became apprehensive in the final hour of trading, selling in 
futures-related computer programs and taking profits ahead of the weekend, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks set a post-crash closing high as active new-account buying 
and a strong rise on Wall Street gave the market confidence. The Financial 
Times 100-share index finished 13.8 points, up at 2,132.8, compared to the 
previous closing high of 2,125.4 on March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices, meanwhile, rallied after the the employment report showed that 
non-farm business payrolls expanded by only 117,000 jobs in April, the weakest 
showing since a drop of 92,000 jobs in June, 1986. The news gave bond investors 
hope that the Fed might loosen the reins on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 3/8 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield, which moves in an opposite direction from price, fell to 
8.95% from 8.99% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar spurted higher in worldwide trading despite waves of concerted 
central bank intervention and the employment report. 
</P>
<P>
As the currency pushed against the level of 1.90 West German marks, the Fed, 
joined by West Germany's Bundesbank and other European central banks, began the 
first rounds of dollar-selling.

OLIVER STONE'S REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I cringed when I read director Oliver Stone's heartless retort to victims of 
communist repression: "When are you going to find the love in your heart to 
forgive and move on?" ("Vietnamese-U.S. Film Symposium Stirs Passions," by 
Daniel Cerone, April 29). 
</P>
<P>
I'm glad Stone wasn't making films in the 1940s. Would he have met with 
Goebbels at a "Nazi-U.S. film symposium" and told victims of the Nazi genocide, 
"You're not the only people in the world that have experienced suffering"? 
</P>
<P>
While film makers sent by communist regimes propagandize freely here, their own 
people live hellish lives. Apparently, their situations are not worthy of 
trendy Hollywood film making.

THE PREVIN-FLEISCHMANN CONTROVERSY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 26, Bernheimer muses: "(Previn's) problem was simple. He seldom 
excited the crowd at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The crowd, moreover, was 
often small when he was in charge." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it just possible that this is more a reflection on "the crowd" than on 
the conductor?

THE PREVIN-FLEISCHMANN CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Bernheimer is at his brilliant best when he asks the basic question: Who should 
be the director of the Philharmonic -- a world-famous 
conductor-composer-performer or an autocrat who doesn't even hold an MBA degree 
("Previn Wanted to Run the Philharmonic -- So Does Fleischmann," April 26)? If 
anyone is to go, it should be Fleischmann.

I think Fleischmann went to hear for himself why droves of concert-goers stay 
away when Previn conducts; he heard every phrase expire (not even die, for that 
would be too dramatic); he noted that Previn believes slow is beautiful, 
torturing the notes by stretching them. The Philharmonic is well rid of Previn.

HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, site of the first Academy Awards ceremony in 
1929 and a symbol of recent efforts to revitalize the sagging movie capital, 
has filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws, representatives of the 
13-story landmark said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The action is aimed at keeping the 324-room hotel open while its owners 
restructure the payments on secured debts totaling $38 million, said attorney 
Richard Wynne, representing the Hollywood Roosevelt Limited Partnership. The 
owners hope to reach financial agreements that will enable the struggling hotel 
to continue operating and to complete further improvements that will augment 
its income, Wynne said. 
</P>
<P>
The owners so far have not discussed selling the hotel and have no plans to 
close it, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's business as usual," Wynne said, stressing that there are no changes 
immediately planned for the hotel's daily operation or management. "We're very 
positive. It's a national landmark. It's been extensively renovated. Chapter 11 
is just a fact of life in America today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment Lagging 
</P>
<P>
But the filing, on Wednesday, underscored the lagging pace of Hollywood's 
$922-million redevelopment effort, designed to bring new business and luster to 
Hollywood's commercial core. The Roosevelt, purchased and renovated by the 
partnership at a cost of $50 million, was given a festive reopening celebration 
in early 1986, an event that was expected to signal a rebirth of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, restored without any government funding, is located on Hollywood 
Boulevard just west of Mann's Chinese Theatre -- the area considered most ripe 
for new commercial growth. But the hotel has been plagued by low occupancy 
rates, about 65% last year, said David Loppert, a hotel vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Although rates have improved to about 80% in recent weeks, debt obligations 
have caught up with the hotel, Loppert said. Rooms rent for an average of $125 
a night, and 10 luxury suites are being reconstructed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other planned commercial developments that were expected to further 
boost occupancy rates, including the $300-million Hollywood Promenade office, 
hotel and entertainment project encircling Mann's Theatre, have not been built 
as quickly as hotel owners had hoped, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hollywood Roosevelt is really the only major redevelopment that has come 
to fruition in Hollywood," Loppert said. "It is kind of frustrating that the 
other major projects . . . have been stalled. We've been waiting with bated 
breath for the (Hollywood Promenade) to get off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
The Promenade, which is expected to contain a 400-room hotel as well as a 
19-story office tower, has been delayed about two years, largely because of 
lawsuits and difficulties in acquiring all of the 2 1/2-block site, said Linda 
Sonnonstine, a spokesman for the Melvin Simon &amp; Associates development 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
But the project broke ground earlier this year and is expected to go forward 
without further difficulty, she said. It is scheduled to open in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit by Activists 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency expressed surprise 
at the bankruptcy filing but predicted that the hotel would continue to be a 
part of Hollywood Boulevard, whether or not the ownership changes. They blamed 
the slow start of the redevelopment plan on a lawsuit filed by activists that 
sought to overturn the plan. But the agency won that suit earlier this year and 
is planning to accelerate its effort in Hollywood, said Judy Broverman, the 
CRA's chief deputy administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, which now features a painted swimming pool by artist David Hockney, 
was the regular meeting place of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences in Hollywood's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's phenomenally important," said Judie B. A. de Turenne, chairman of 
Hollywood Heritage Inc., the largest preservationist group in Hollywood. "It 
would be a great tragedy to lose the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
The owners will be meeting next week with creditors to begin negotiating 
agreements, attorney Wynne said. The owners are due to file a full list of 
debts, including overdue payments, in 45 days and a complete reorganization 
plan in four months, he said.

LOBBYIST'S LETTER URGES DONATIONS TO THANK FERRARO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lobbyist for ambulance companies has urged her clients to give a political 
contribution to Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro as thanks for 
his persuading Councilman Nate Holden to hold a committee hearing on proposed 
ambulance fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
"Last spring and summer, when we were working to get the fee increase approved, 
Councilman Holden agreed to schedule us into his committee if we would agree to 
support Councilman Ferraro's next fund-raiser," lobbyist Ann Carlton Bose wrote 
ambulance company leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blaine Group (her employer) plans to participate by purchasing a seat for 
this dinner," the letter said. "We urge you to join us in thanking Mr. Ferraro 
for his loyalty and support." 
</P>
<P>
Holden, who is chairman of the Transportation and Traffic Committee, and 
Ferraro denied asking for contributions in exchange for scheduling a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is untrue as far as I am concerned," Ferraro said. "It's a lie," Holden 
said. Later, Holden told a reporter, "people are going to read this 
(expletive). . . ." -- and burst into wrenching sobs. Holden's sobbing was so 
intense that he was unable to speak, even after his chief of staff, Herb J. 
Wesson Jr., brought him water. Only after the councilman wiped his face with a 
wet paper towel did he resume talking. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman sobbing behind his desk, his head cradled in his hands, provided 
a dramatic moment in a supercharged City Hall already tense because of the 
investigation into the financial affairs of Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The Bose letter was obtained by Linda Douglass of television station KNBC, and 
was confirmed by The Times in interviews with Bose, Blaine Group President 
Devon Blaine and Rand Brooks, chairman of one of the ambulance companies 
employing Bose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Is a Good Friend' 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Bose said, "You may recall that Councilman Ferraro was 
especially helpful to us when we were attempting to get the fee increase 
scheduled before the Transportation and Traffic Committee." At another point in 
the letter, she said, "I want to encourage your support for this man. He was 
instrumental in getting us scheduled into committee last year. He is a good 
friend to the ambulance industry and keeps his promises. Now it is time to keep 
ours." 
</P>
<P>
Bose said that her letter stemmed from her efforts to get a hearing before 
Holden's committee last year for an ordinance increasing ambulance fees, which 
are regulated by the city. The ambulance companies contended that rising 
expenses and reduced payments from Medi-Cal and Medicare were hurting them 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
After four months of trying, she said, she called Ferraro for help in 
persuading Holden to schedule a hearing. "He has always been accessible to me 
when I called him. I called him because he was president of the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
"He called me back and said, 'this is kind of silly, I am embarrassed to ask 
this, but Holden says if your clients will support my (Ferraro's) next 
fund-raiser, he would schedule it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I said 'John, we come to your fund-raisers anyway but tell him yes.' That was 
the nature of our conversation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Better Cover It' 
</P>
<P>
"When I wrote this letter, I was not entirely sure it (Ferraro's conversation) 
was a joke or not so I thought I had better go forward. On the off chance it 
wasn't a joke, I thought I had better cover it." 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he opposed the increase and a provision in the measure that would 
have given the city Transportation Commission greater rate-setting authority. 
Holden said he never spoke to Bose. Instead, chief of staff Wesson and another 
aide handled the case. Wesson said he told her Holden had objections to the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I will take a polygraph test and I am going to sue," Holden said. "She hurt 
me. I have a good name, and I am going to keep it good." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro said he talked to Bose once. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his conversation with Holden on the delay in having a hearing, 
Ferraro said: "As president of the council, it is my responsibility to move 
files (proposed ordinances) through the process. I talked to Nate (Holden). 
Nate said he was seeking additional information from the Department of 
Transportation (on the proposal) and he wasn't ready to put the file on the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Extent of It' 
</P>
<P>
"I told her (Bose) I talked to him. That was the extent of it," Ferraro said, 
adding that he never mentioned the subject of his fund-raiser in his 
conversation with Bose. 
</P>
<P>
Rand Brooks, chairman of Professional Ambulance Service, one of the firms 
employing Bose, said he did not have a copy of the letter before him, but he 
believed that the letter was authentic. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds very authoritative to me and I think that at that time we did 
participate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blaine, president of the Blaine Group, said she knew of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Bose was an "up-front and honest" person and "if that is 
something she said he (Ferraro) said, he said it, whether it was a joke or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
A Ferraro aide said he had not yet received contributions from the ambulance 
companies employing Bose for his fund-raiser, which is a May 11 luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Be Reviewed 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the city attorney's office said that news accounts of the 
letter will be reviewed "and if there is something in the paper that looks like 
it raises questions," the office will look into it. He said a reporter's verbal 
account of the letter will be passed on to the office of special operations. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement sources said the incident could be investigated under Section 
68 of the state Penal Code, which forbids public officials to seek or receive 
bribes. The offense is punishable by up to four years incarceration, forfeiture 
of office and permanent disqualification from public office.

AFTER 11-YEAR WAIT, IT'S SHOW TIME FOR PLAINTIFF-ATTORNEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The jury in San Fernando Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter's courtroom was 
away for a five-minute recess. The attorneys were milling by their tables when 
Schacter entered, walked to his bench and called them back by spreading his 
arms wide and bellowing: "Show time!" 
</P>
<P>
Justice was not being mocked. It was working. Slowly, anonymously, 
good-naturedly and, above all, patiently. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Schacter's small, modern, wood-paneled courtroom, four South Los Angeles 
residents were finally going to trial against a huge financial institution 
after spending 11 years squabbling about home improvement loans that went sour. 
</P>
<P>
For the plaintiffs -- John and Shirley Thymes and Charles and Cora Brown -- it 
should have been a relieving, cathartic experience. Instead it was, as Cora 
Brown put it, "a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
It was a nightmare because the Thymeses and the Browns wound up acting as their 
own attorneys, a challenge that for all its quixotic appeal is almost never 
undertaken in a civil trial of this complexity, involving 90 court exhibits and 
a tangled chronology that weaved through loan applications, liens, job 
estimates, phone calls and possibly forged signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of two weeks, the Thymeses and the Browns would put everyone in 
Schacter's courtroom -- including themselves -- to a severe test. By the end, 
several jurors would conclude that if they were ever asked to serve in another 
of these so-called pro per cases, they would ask to be excused. Watching laymen 
try to be lawyers was simply too exhausting, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The Thymeses and the Browns, who first filed their lawsuit against Beverly 
Hills-based Gibraltar Savings in Los Angeles Superior Court in 1980, hadn't 
planned it this way. But at the last minute their attorney -- one of several 
they had hired over the years -- dropped out. After waiting this long for their 
day in court, they simply didn't want to wait any longer. They swallowed hard 
and went it alone. 
</P>
<P>
And so one day John Thymes, churning with visible anxiety, wearing a dark 
patterned sport coat entirely too flashy for a lawyer, was examining a witness 
he'd called the day before. 
</P>
<P>
It was his wife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Know Too Much 
</P>
<P>
He walked up to the witness stand and began to question Shirley Thymes about a 
Gibraltar loan document. Their conversation was awkward. John Thymes runs a 
secretarial service store in the Crenshaw District and has frequently been in 
courtrooms, and Shirley Thymes once planned to go to law school, but the couple 
had become so obsessed with the particulars of their lawsuit that to jurors 
their exchanges were often impenetrable. They simply know too much for their 
own good. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the matter of posture. John Thymes had his back to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Thymes," Schacter said, "when you stand there, half the jury can't see or 
hear you. It looks good in movies. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And with that Schacter began to explain to all concerned why it looks good in 
movies, how the camera's desire to focus on the attorney-witness angle ignores 
the distance that real-life lawyers normally maintain so that they can 
simultaneously play to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
This was how Schacter played two roles -- attorney and judge -- during the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
A kindly, balding man in his 40s who prides himself on courtroom civility, 
Schacter had inherited this case from downtown because there were no courts 
available. He hadn't read the file. He didn't know the background. Yet he found 
himself having to painstakingly regulate the organization and dispensing of 
hundreds of tiny facts for the benefit of the plaintiffs, separating what they 
considered truth from what the law considers proof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basic Issue 
</P>
<P>
The basic issue in the trial was the contention that Gibraltar -- which has 
suffered severe financial losses in recent years and is now in a government 
conservatorship -- should be held financially responsible for the conduct of an 
independent home-repair contractor. According to state regulators, the 
contractor, Reinaldo Gilbert, owner of Mr. Fix-It, swindled dozens of residents 
and persuaded most of them to finance their repairs through Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, Gibraltar had reached financial settlements with numerous 
families who borrowed money for jobs performed by Mr. Fix-It, but no settlement 
had been offered to the Thymeses. Gibraltar contended that it had paid for 
completion of work that Mr. Fix-It left undone. Gibraltar offered a $135,000 
settlement to the Browns, but the Browns chose to go to trial. Like the 
Thymeses, they believed they could obtain significant damages for pain and 
suffering in court. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was enjoined from doing further business a decade ago and was no longer 
a defendant by the time the lawsuit went to trial. The challenge for the 
Thymeses and the Browns was to show that Gibraltar was at least indirectly 
responsible for Gilbert's misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
To do this, they claimed that a former Gibraltar loan agent, Mike Garner, had 
continually vouched for Gilbert even after it became evident that Gilbert was 
not going to finish the jobs he started. 
</P>
<P>
John Thymes made a stab at questioning Garner, but Schacter quickly broke in. 
Thymes was not being focused enough. His interrogation lacked sequence. "The 
dangerous thing when you're inside your own case," the judge had observed 
earlier outside of the courtroom, "is that everything is important to you, 
every piece of paper you fought for." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Asks Questions 
</P>
<P>
So Schacter began to pepper Garner with inquiries about if and when he had met 
Gilbert, whether he had vouched for him, whether he had ever told anyone that 
Gilbert -- who routinely provided Gibraltar loan application forms to his 
clients -- worked for the financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
Schacter routinely did this. He explained procedure. He made sure pieces of 
evidence were properly numbered. He stopped the proceedings so that Shirley 
Thymes could leave the witness stand to put in her hearing aid. Outside the 
jury's presence he gently nagged Mrs. Thymes to pay more attention to her 
husband so she wouldn't repeat questions when it was her turn to question 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Schacter could have required the Thymeses and Browns to designate one member of 
their party as counsel, but he decided against it. All four could ask questions 
and call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Why shouldn't they have their day in court?" he said over lunch one day. "I 
figure this thing's been long enough in the system. There's no way when this is 
over they won't be able to say they had their day in court." 
</P>
<P>
There were seven tedious days of trial and two days of jury deliberation. On 
Thursday morning John Thymes, dressed and waiting, received a phone call at his 
home on 107th Street, a place that remains a hodgepodge from work that was done 
and re-done improperly in 1977. The call was from the court. The jury was 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Feel Satisfied' 
</P>
<P>
The two couples drove to San Fernando. John Thymes was in such a hurry he 
forgot his coat. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel satisfied," Shirley Thymes said as she waited in court. "Regardless of 
which way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
The jurors came in. The clerk read their verdict. By a 9-3 margin the jury 
determined that Gibraltar Savings had recklessly made false representations 
with intent to defraud. The Thymeses and the Browns had won. 
</P>
<P>
But not very much. 
</P>
<P>
The jury ordered Gibraltar to pay the Thymeses $21,182 and the Browns $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners were crestfallen. Over the last decade, they estimated that they 
had spent more than $50,000 on lawyers alone. "No way, no way," said Charles 
Brown, a warehouse worker, when asked if he was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
One of Gibraltar's two attorneys, Sharon Mason, was, as she said with a smile, 
"pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Like any other attorney, John Thymes talked casually with the jurors in the 
courtroom later. Unlike a professional attorney, he did not hide his anguished 
belief that the jury had simply not understood the facts. 
</P>
<P>
Several sympathetic jurors told him he was lucky to have gotten as much money 
as he did. 
</P>
<P>
"John," one of them said, "what you have to understand is that you had no 
proof." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Appeal 
</P>
<P>
John Thymes said he would probably appeal and try to find an attorney to 
represent him. 
</P>
<P>
Another juror, Jack Lasnik, a Chatsworth resident, was walking out of the 
courtroom when he stopped a reporter to mention how impressed he was by Judge 
Schacter. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the fairest individuals I've ever met," Lasnik said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was overall fair," Shirley Thymes said. "He didn't do us any special favors 
because we were pro per." 
</P>
<P>
"The most important factor is to keep everybody calm," Schacter had said 
privately the week before. "If I get impatient, everybody's going to get 
impatient." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he added, this trial was not his highest display of patience. If you 
wanted to see that you'd have to come back Friday and watch him handle the San 
Fernando Superior Court's law and motion calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I deal with a hundred lawyers," he smiled.

AGENTS SEIZE 13 IN MAJOR STREET GANG DRUG BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 250 federal agents and police officers swooped into a South-Central Los 
Angeles neighborhood shortly before dawn Friday, bursting into 16 suspected 
rock houses and arresting the reputed leaders of a $1-million-a-month cocaine 
operation run by a street gang called the Five Deuce Hoover Gangster Crips. 
</P>
<P>
The operation culminated in the most significant undercover operation so far by 
a new state and federal gang task force. It resulted in 13 arrests of what are 
believed to be the major suppliers of one of the city's most violent street 
gangs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vicious and Violent' 
</P>
<P>
"They are one of the heaviest-involved gangs in terms of crack cocaine in the 
city," said Ralph Lochridge, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"They're also one of the most vicious and violent, in terms of the numbers of 
drive-by shootings, armed robberies, rapes and armed assaults. What the task 
force has done is basically gone in and surgically removed the leadership and 
the hard-core drug traffickers within this particular gang." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the task force targeted the Five Deuce Hoover Gangster Crips, 
a 1,000-member set whose territory includes the region surrounding 52nd and 
Hoover streets, when a well-placed informant within the gang was able to 
introduce undercover agents to the organization's top crack suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Over a period of months, the informant allegedly led agents into the gang's 
most heavily fortified rock houses, standing by while the agents completed 
secretive drug buys, negotiated the sale of automatic weapons and learned 
intimate details of gang members' criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
A series of affidavits unsealed Friday in federal court outline many of the 
transactions, in which undercover agents met heavily armed gang members on 
street corners and in fortified rock houses, forking over $1,800 and $1,900 at 
a time to purchase rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In one transaction, the documents allege, they negotiated to trade several 
Mac-10 submachine guns for cocaine from John Leo Bentley, introduced to them as 
"Baby Johnny." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley, 31, believed to be one of the gang's biggest suppliers, confided to 
the agents that he was the target of a murder plot by other gang members who 
believed that he had become too wealthy and powerful through his drug-dealing 
activities, according to one affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley now faces 20 years to life on the charges. Another alleged major 
supplier targeted by the agents was Barbara Hammond, 50, who allegedly oversaw 
a family crack operation from her 48th Street home since 1981, an operation 
that included her husband, daughter and two sons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drive-by Shootings 
</P>
<P>
The undercover informant documented evidence of a number of drive-by shootings 
by members of the gang during the investigation, and two of the original 
targets of the probe were murdered before it was completed, according to the 
affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
The agents themselves were occasionally at risk, the documents show. After one 
buy from Bentley, a DEA surveillance team informed the two agents who had just 
completed the transaction that they were being watched by Bentley's associates. 
The agents ducked into a nearby Sizzler restaurant to wait for backup. 
</P>
<P>
Lochridge said the gang is believed to have been moving $500,000 to $1 million 
a month worth of rock cocaine, some of it going to Detroit and other Eastern 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Gang Drug Task Force, launched by the U.S. attorney's office 
last year, has obtained indictments against 39 defendants so far, but the Five 
Deuce Gangster Crip investigation is the largest attempted by the multi-agency 
group to date, said Assistant U.S. Atty. John Gordon, head of the task force. 
</P>
<P>
A similar FBI task force resulted in 10 indictments against members of the 74 
Hoover Gangster Crips, some of whom face mandatory life sentences under stiff 
federal narcotics laws, Gordon said. All of those arrested Friday face minimum 
prison terms of five years, and most could be sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested Friday were Jasper (Junior) Anderson, 19; Julius Beavers, 23; Bentley; 
Kevin (Hoover Bam) Bishop, 21; Kevin (Argo) Brown, 22; Randy Hall, 19; Hammond; 
Cathy Hammond, 25; Dwight (Snake) Murphy, 35; Eules Thompson, 22; Tracy 
Washington, 25, and two men identified only as "Looney" and "Nicky."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BROKEN GAS MAIN FORCES EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction workers ruptured a natural gas main Friday, forcing firefighters 
to evacuate three apartment buildings in the City Terrace area east of downtown 
Los Angeles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers digging a trench with a backhoe broke the gas line about 11 a.m. in the 
2800 block of East Lancaster Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department was alerted and decided to evacuate three two-story 
apartment buildings while waiting for Southern California Gas Co. crews to 
arrive and fix the broken two-inch pipe, Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo 
said. No fires or explosions were reported.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL KILLS TRASH FEE IN PROPOSED BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council's Finance and Revenue Committee approved a 
$3.2-billion city budget plan after eliminating Mayor Tom Bradley's proposal 
for a trash-collection fee that would have cost about $43-a-year per household. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's version of the spending program could be used to help finance 
the first year of a proposed recycling program by cutting $23 million of 
spending proposed by Bradley, including some salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
The budget now faces a vote by the full City Council.

JUDGE HOLDS UP U.S. BID TO DEPORT 'SUBVERSIVES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Government efforts to deport a group of immigrants once charged with subversion 
ran into more roadblocks Friday in Immigration Court as Justice Department 
attorneys admitted that they had wrongly charged one of the defendants with 
fraud in a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration Judge Ingrid K. Hrycenko ruled that deportation efforts aimed at 
two lead defendants -- Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles, and Michel Shehadeh, 
33, of Long Beach -- cannot proceed until a federal court decision affecting 
their cases is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh face subversion charges under the McCarran-Walter Act. The 
act, passed during the McCarthy era of the 1950s, allows the deportation of 
aliens for advocating world communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the 
unlawful destruction of property. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles overturned 
several of the act's political sections and declared that aliens have the same 
broad free speech rights as U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Until the McCarran-Walter decision is resolved -- whether through the appellate 
process or simply by having the government throw in the towel -- Hrycenko ruled 
that their cases "will not proceed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Immigrants Jailed 
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh were among eight immigrants -- seven Palestinians and a 
Kenyan -- arrested in January, 1987, and jailed for almost two weeks on charges 
that they belonged to a Palestinian group with a history of terrorism. All 
denied the charges, and none were charged criminally. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were eventually dropped against three other immigrants. But three more 
still faced lesser deportation charges -- and for the first time in 27 months 
the government proceeded against them this week. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a three-man team of Justice Department attorneys from Washington 
moved against Bashar Amer, 27, of Glendale. He is charged with not maintaining 
his academic status -- that is, not taking 12 units a semester, as generally 
required by immigration rules, at Chaffey College in Rancho Cucamonga between 
1985 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, immigration officials subpoenaed Amer's college records. But when 
Justice Department attorney Stewart Deutsch produced the subpoena for the court 
on Friday, it said that Amer was being investigated in connection with "a fraud 
against the United States." 
</P>
<P>
A surprised Hrycenko asked Deutsch how that could be possible when the charge 
against Amer was that he had not taken enough college credits to remain in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Maybe It's Sloppiness' 
</P>
<P>
"There is no fraud," Deutsch admitted. "That is an error." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's solely sloppiness," said Hrycenko. She continued Amer's hearing 
until July so that the government could change the charge. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based immigration official who signed the erroneous subpoena, 
John Brechtel, assistant district director for investigations, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Amer's lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout of the National Lawyers Guild, said he had "no 
reason to think (the fraud charge) wasn't intentional" in light of the 
government's continuing efforts to deport the immigrants.

TWO FAMILIES FIGHT TO ADOPT ABANDONED TOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a newborn baby was found abandoned on the front seat of a car in Covina 
three months ago, wrapped in a beach towel with a red shoestring tying his 
umbilical cord, he faced a bleak future as an unwanted drug baby. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Baby Doe is desperately wanted by two different families despite health 
problems resulting from his addiction. A foster family that has grown attached 
to the boy they call Daniel is trying to block the county from placing him with 
another couple under a new speedy adoption program. 
</P>
<P>
And the child's temporary foster mother, Joyce Simmons of Eagle Rock, went into 
hiding with the frail, blond infant Friday. She said she will not emerge until 
a Duarte couple approved for long-term foster care can obtain a court order 
barring the county from removing him for placement with another family who 
expects to adopt him. 
</P>
<P>
The situation underscores the demand for newborns, especially white infants, 
among the hundreds of prospective adoptive families who have applied through 
the county system and often spend years on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, we were led to believe by the social worker that we 
would be able to adopt him," said a distraught Randy Williams, an insurance 
claims supervisor who with his wife, Pam, has visited the child daily. They sat 
at his side during a recent hospitalization, kept him in their home for a week 
last month and were given final approval as long-term foster parents this week. 
"We were encouraged to bond with him, to name him, to spend as much time with 
him as we could." 
</P>
<P>
The social worker, Regina Gorree of the Department of Children's Services' 
Pomona office, could not be reached late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Simmons: "It's a betrayal by the system. The Williamses were told he would 
be coming to them. They've watched him grow from seven to 13 pounds, heard his 
first cooing and held him when he shook as he went through (drug) withdrawal 
these past three months." 
</P>
<P>
However, Simmons, who has taken in children on a temporary basis for 20 years 
and adopted three herself, was notified earlier this week by a second social 
worker that the child would be picked up Friday for adoptive placement with the 
third family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Abide by Court Decision 
</P>
<P>
She and the Williams family, friends of hers, say they will comply with 
whatever the court decides but will not give up the baby without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate," said Catherine Tracy, chief deputy of the Department of 
Children's Services, "but we have a family who've been waiting for nine years 
to adopt who are sitting on pins and needles." The prospective adoptive family 
was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
She discounted the argument that parent-child bonding has already occurred and 
said it would be unfair to families waiting their turn if her department were 
to bypass them and give the boy to the Williamses. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem stems from apparent misunderstandings within the 
department; part of it has to do with the county's new IDEA program (short for 
early identification for adoption) implemented to speed up the adoption 
process. Adoptions that used to take several years can now be processed in a 
matter of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wait for License 
</P>
<P>
But neither Simmons nor the Williamses knew about that, and Williams said he 
thought he couldn't apply to adopt Daniel until he and his wife had received 
their foster-care license. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy said she hoped the matter could be resolved over the weekend, although 
the situation was still at an impasse after four hours of conversations with 
Simmons on Friday. She said she knows the baby is safe with Simmons and that 
Simmons will return home eventually where "my worker is waiting to pick up the 
baby. I may just take two deep breaths and wait." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, there are no clear winners in the case -- except for a 
3-month-old baby who will have a home where he is definitely wanted.

MCKEY'S LAST-SECOND SHOT PITS SONICS AGAINST LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers will play the Seattle SuperSonics in their first game of the second 
round of the National Basketball Assn. playoffs Sunday at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
This was determined when Derrick McKey made a driving layup at the buzzer to 
give the SuperSonics a 98-96 victory over the Rockets Friday night at Houston. 
The Sonics won the series, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
With his shot, McKey made sure that this was the only one of the night's three 
playoff games that didn't go into overtime. Atlanta defeated Milwaukee, and 
Cleveland beat Chicago in overtime games that squared those Eastern series at 
2-2 each, with the final games to be played Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although McKey made the decisive basket, Dale Ellis was the star of the game 
for Seattle. Ellis, who suffered a broken nose during Sunday's game, scored 26 
points. He made only five of his 17 two-point shots but sank all four of his 
three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one second left when Seattle's Nate McMillan made a long pass 
over 7-foot-5 Chuck Nevitt to McKey for the winning layup. McKey had been a 
disappointment in the first three games of the series. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan was for Dale (Ellis) to set a back screen for Derrick," SuperSonic 
Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said. "I still don't know whether he did or not." 
</P>
<P>
McKey, who is 6-9 and was being guarded by 6-2 Allen Leavell, said, "When I 
caught the ball, I knew I didn't have time to bring it back down, so I just 
gave it a leaning layup." 
</P>
<P>
As always, Akeem Olajuwon kept the Rockets from falling apart. He made 11 of 17 
shots, grabbed 13 rebounds and had four steals. 
</P>
<P>
But Sleepy Floyd, who had a big game Wednesday night when the Rockets won their 
only game of the series, made only five of 14 shots and finished with 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 108, Chicago 105 -- As he is accustomed to doing, Michael Jordan 
carried the Bulls within sight of the second round of the playoffs at Chicago, 
scoring 50 points. 
</P>
<P>
But after Cleveland's Larry Nance sent the game into overtime, Jordan fouled 
out, and the Cavaliers tied the series at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the final seconds of regulation, Jordan was being double-teamed at the side 
of the free-throw lane when his forced jumper bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Nance, who finished with 27 points, nine rebounds and three blocked shots, and 
Mark Price took charge for the Cavaliers in overtime and sent the series back 
to Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who started slowly in the series, has closed with a rush, scoring 94 
points in the last two games to give him 155 in four. 
</P>
<P>
Price, hampered by a groin injury that caused him to miss the first game of the 
series, made eight of 13 shots for 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 113, Milwaukee 106 -- The Bucks lost Terry Cummings because of a 
sprained ankle he suffered six minutes into the game at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Moses Malone led a second-quarter spurt that enabled the Hawks to build a 58-45 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
But reserves Jack Sikma and Ricky Pierce rallied the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Sikma had a chance to win it for Milwaukee after being fouled with two seconds 
left. One of the best free-throw shooters in the game, Sikma missed one, and 
the game went into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Malone took over in overtime, and the Hawks won going away. He finished with 24 
points and 17 rebounds. DAN HAFNER

DAWSON IS AWESOME; CUBS WIN; 
</P>
<P>
IN 4-2 VICTORY OVER DODGERS, OUTFIELDER HAS 2 HOMERS, 2 SINGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers went to work Friday night with Mike Marshall, Kirk Gibson, Chris 
Gwynn and Alfredo Griffin unavailable because of injuries and Jeff Hamilton 
absent because of the imminent arrival of his and wife Shelly's first child. 
</P>
<P>
The problem caused by the depletion of the Dodger roster was compounded by the 
arrival of Andre Dawson, as healthy as the Dodgers were ailing and about to get 
even healthier. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson hit two homers and a pair of singles as the Chicago Cubs defeated the 
Dodgers, 4-2, before a Dodger Stadium crowd of 46,767. 
</P>
<P>
The Cub right fielder has eight hits in a row and 10 in his last 11 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a series of adjustments for the surge that began in San Diego this week, 
Dawson also credited the warmer weather on the West Coast. He had gone 0 for 11 
against the Dodgers in frigid Chicago recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I might get revenge here," he said with a smile, having done just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson collected both homers and a single off starter and loser Tim Belcher 
(2-3), then singled again off Tim Crews. 
</P>
<P>
He has three homers, three triples and four singles in his 10-of-11 spurt and 
is the first Cub to roll out eight straight hits since Bobby Murcer in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers outhit Dawson, 10-4, and even outhit the Cubs, 10-8, but stranded 
eight runners. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson (3-2) went five innings as the starter and winner, then watched 
Pat Perry and Mitch Williams shut out the Dodgers over the final four. 
</P>
<P>
Williams worked the last inning for his ninth save. It was a characteristic 
effort by the heat-throwing but often wild left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia walked to open the ninth, then John Shelby and Franklin Stubbs 
struck out. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Rick Dempsey drew another walk to put the tying runs on base, but 
Williams survived when center fielder Dwight Smith caught Mariano Duncan's 
towering drive with his back to the fence. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, shut out by St. Louis rookie Ken Hill Thursday night, scored only 
in the second inning of this one. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher, replacing Hamilton at third base, doubled to open the inning. A 
single by Scioscia and a double by Stubbs accounted for the runs -- and the 
first RBI by Stubbs this season. 
</P>
<P>
With Marshall (lower back stiffness), Gwynn (strained right shoulder) and 
Gibson (still on the disabled list with hamstring tendinitis) all sidelined, 
Stubbs played left field, and Mike Davis was in right. 
</P>
<P>
A lineup dictated by the medical reports produced only one other threat between 
the two runs of the second inning and the last gasp of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
It came in the fourth, which Hatcher opened with a single, only to be thrown 
out on a steal attempt. Ensuing singles by Scioscia and Stubbs were wasted. 
</P>
<P>
Even Eddie Murray's 13-game hitting streak ended as the Cubs won for the 
seventh time in their last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Said Belcher of Dawson: "The scouting report that came from San Diego said he 
was hitting anything and everything. I've had good success against him in the 
past but he's a great hitter, and every dog has his day. 
</P>
<P>
"The solo home runs (he also allowed one to Ryne Sandberg) don't upset me that 
much. What really burns me is making bad pitches to the bottom of their lineup. 
I beat myself and that's upsetting." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher alluded to a fourth-inning walk to Damon Berryhill that contributed to 
an unearned run in a three-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson had slugged his first homer and fourth of the season in the second, a 
high drive halfway up the left-field pavilion between the 360 and 370 marks. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg homered to left with one out in the fourth, and Dawson followed with 
his second, more of a line drive over the 395 mark in left center. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers have a premier pitching staff and you have to keep making 
adjustments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've cut down on my stride and am using my hands more to keep from getting out 
on my front foot. The idea is not to press, to go up there relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Now batting .307, Dawson had been at .236 with only six hits in his previous 38 
at-bats going into the series in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On the bus to the stadium before the first game there, Dawson suddenly 
addressed himself and his slump. He startled teammates who seldom hear him talk 
on the bus by saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Forget this crouching bull. I'm going to stand up tall. If I'm going to hit 
.230, I'm going to hit a hard .230." 
</P>
<P>
The mental adjustment came first, and Dawson hasn't gone down softly since. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela will start as scheduled for the Dodgers Wednesday night in 
Pittsburgh, pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. . . . Of the difference between 
Valenzuela's seven shutout innings in St. Louis and his pounding by the 
Cardinals Thursday night, Perranoski said, "He got the ball up, his location 
was off. He threw the ball well between starts, but there's a human element 
involved. Every time out is not going to be the same." . . . Perranoski said 
Valenzuela can be successful with his current repertoire, but there is "more 
necessity" to keep the ball down because of his reduced velocity. "Fernando 
understands that, but it's a learning process." he added. "Bob Knepper and 
Tommy John are natural sinkerball pitchers. Fernando could make the ball move, 
but he was not a natural sinkerball pitcher." . . . Will some of his velocity 
return? "I see it improving," Perranoski said. "Will it improve 10 miles per 
hour? Probably not. Four? Yes, I can see that."

MORNING BRIEFING: SPORTSWRITER LACKED FOCUS, BUT HE DID GET THE PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athletes are not the only ones reputed to have a zest for life. Reporters who 
cover sports have also been known for their gusto. 
</P>
<P>
Old-time sportswriters were known as much for their high jinks as their 
colorful clauses and vibrant verbs. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Anderson was one of the zaniest, recalled the Associated Press' Will 
Grimsley. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a colleague of Grimsley on a newspaper in Knoxville, Tenn., rarely 
went for the usual angle at an athletic event. Often, a score wasn't even 
included in his story. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," Grimsley recalled, "he didn't go for any angle at all. One time, 
they sent him out to cover the Rose Bowl and they didn't hear from Tom for five 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Before football started in September, things would be pretty slow, and the 
writers would run their pictures in a half-column over their articles. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom put (actor) Robert Taylor's picture over one of his pieces, and it caused 
a huge uproar," Grimsley said. 
</P>
<P>
"The letters poured in, and he ran bits and pieces of them while apologizing. 
That day he ran Clark Gable's picture as his own." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What is the lowest number of RBIs a player batting more than 500 
times has had in a season? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Albert goes to Washington: Brian Albert, son of sports broadcaster Marv 
Albert, missed Pamela Rothman's social studies class at Port Washington, N.Y., 
because he was visiting the White House. But Rothman wanted to verify the 
excuse, so she wrote to the President and included an absence form. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could have your cooperation, then maybe other parents, guardians would 
understand the importance of safeguarding attendance procedures," Rothman wrote 
to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Came this reply: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Pamela, 
</P>
<P>
"Parents and teachers should care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK, he was with me. The absence slip's enclosed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
"(Signature) George Bush." 
</P>
<P>
Bush signed the absence form and in the space for makeup assignment wrote, "No

Weird science: Chris Antley's consecutive-day winning streak stopped at 64 when 
New York's leading rider failed to win on any of his five mounts at Aqueduct 
Monday. Antley had won at least one race a day at Aqueduct since Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I ever went winless and got press," Antley told 
Newsday's Mark Berner after being shut out. "When I woke up, I thought 64 rang 
a bell. You know how some numbers sound good? I said 65, I don't think I'm 
going to get to 65. I'm superstitious and I think about things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously.

Facts and figures: The Daily Racing Form's annual survey of sports attendance 
for 1988 offers attendance figures as proof that baseball truly is America's 
pastime. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the 26 major league teams, the 19 minor league circuits, the World 
Series and league championship series and colleges, a total of 89,525,211 
watched the Grand Old Game. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Form, horse racing was second with 74,158,269, followed by 
football with 51,024,820, basketball (the 1987-88 season) with 46,555,845, and 
ice hockey with 26,875,143. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated figures for auto racing put it second at 85,968,814, and greyhound 
racing would have come close to ice hockey with an estimated 26,618,552.

WEEKEND RACING AT HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC MERCI IN DIFFERENT SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three months ago, trainer Craig Lewis figured he would be spending the first 
Saturday in May at the Kentucky Derby, running his top 3-year-old, Music Merci. 
</P>
<P>
Music Merci will be running today all right, but it will be at Hollywood Park 
in the Spotlight Handicap. And the closest Lewis got to the Derby this year was 
the Churchill Downs souvenir T-shirt he was wearing Friday morning at the barn. 
</P>
<P>
"You can describe my feelings as ambivalent," said Lewis as Music Merci's 
kindly gray face peered out of stall No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, I've got the third-best 3-year-old in the country, behind Easy 
Goer and Sunday Silence. But it would have made no sense to ship back there for 
third place. The prudent thing is to stay here, run in the Spotlight, and then 
ship to Chicago to run for a half a million in the Illinois Derby. Making money 
is the point of this business, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Making money, in lieu of national headlines, is what Music Merci does best. 
Since the little gelding won his first start nearly a year ago, he has earned 
$781,020 for owners Harvey Cohen and Lonnie Pendleton. Of the 16 horses running 
in the Derby, only favored Easy Goer has banked more. 
</P>
<P>
At a mile on the turf, the Spotlight deals right to Music Merci's strength, 
even though he has never run on grass. His best races have been at a mile on 
hard main tracks, and the Hollywood Park course has been extremely firm, 
prompting several near-record performances already at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron will be riding Music Merci, who carries top weight of 122 
pounds. The opposition includes Tenacious Tom, Northern Drama, Raise a Stanza, 
Double Quick, Magnetized, Roback, Runaway Dunaway, Irish, Excellerbration, 
Exemplary Leader and Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Also featured today will be the Triple Bend Handicap at seven furlongs on the 
main track. 
</P>
<P>
Perfec Travel, who scored a 36-1 upset in the same race last year, will defend 
his title against high-weighted Oraibi, Frost Free, Hot Operator, Sensational 
Star, Jamoke, Happy in Space, Beyond the Wall and Iz a Saros. 
</P>
<P>
And if trainer Charlie Whittingham does not win the Derby with Sunday Silence, 
he will have trouble losing Sunday's $108,700 Wilshire Handicap at Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham has the 1 1/8-mile turf race surrounded with Galunpe, Claire Marine 
and Fitzwilliam Place, any one of whom deserves to be favored. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition includes Down Again, Lady Brunicardi, Pen Bal Lady and Double 
Wedge.

CANADIENS TAKE 2-1 LEAD BY DEFEATING FLYERS, 5-1

<P>
Shayne Corson and Bob Gainey scored less than three minutes apart early in the 
second period as the Montreal Canadiens took a 2-1 lead in the Wales Conference 
finals Friday night with a 5-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Game 4 will be played here Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
With the Canadiens leading, 1-0, on Guy Carbonneau's goal late in the first 
period, Corson was left alone during a power play and steered Eric Desjardins' 
centering pass into an empty net at 3:14. 
</P>
<P>
Gainey, the Canadiens' captain, scored his first goal of the playoffs at 6:11, 
breaking behind the defense and flipping Chris Chelios' pass from the right 
boards over goaltender Ken Wregget for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Courtnall made it 4-0 at 14:53 when he took a lead pass from Ryan Walter 
at the Flyers' blue line and beat Wregget to the short side from the top of the 
right circle. 
</P>
<P>
Walter also set up the game's first goal, stealing the puck from Scott Mellanby 
near the blue line and poking it to Carbonneau, who beat Wregget with a 15-foot 
backhander from the slot at 14:26 on the Canadiens' second shot of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tremendous hill to climb," said Flyer Coach Paul Holmgren. "The 
Canadiens are on their game, playing like they did in the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal Coach Pat Burns said: "We knew their fans would have them fired up. We 
were prepared for it. They had lots of shots, but how many were scoring?" 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Roy, who blanked the Flyers in Game 2, lost his bid for a second 
straight shutout at 6:56 of the final period on a goal by Brian Propp, who 
returned after suffering a concussion when he was elbowed into the boards by 
Chelios in Game 1. The goal was Propp's 13th of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, 9-1 in the playoffs, broke a nine-game career winless streak against 
Philadelphia Wednesday night. This time, he was especially strong in the 
opening minutes of the game, when he made several key saves, and at the start 
of the second period, when he stopped Tim Kerr and Propp. Roy finished with 25 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal, which broke a six-game winless streak at the Spectrum with a 7-4 
victory in its last regular-season visit Feb. 16, ended any thoughts of a 
Philadelphia comeback when Bobby Smith beat Wregget with a 20-foot slap shot on 
a two-on-one at 12:21.

NCAA VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
STANFORD, UCLA TUNE UP FOR TITLE MATCH TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Volleyball players from UCLA and Stanford played semifinal matches Friday night 
in the NCAA Division I Final Four with their minds on the same thing: Each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA swept Penn State, 15-6, 15-4, 15-9, and Stanford beat Ball State, 15-13, 
8-15, 15-9, 15-13, before a crowd of 2,192 at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will attempt to win its 13th national championship, and Stanford will try 
to become the first team other than UCLA, USC, Pepperdine and San Diego State 
to win the title when the Bruins and Cardinal meet tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the same thing with the Soviets and the U.S. in the Olympics," said 
Stanford hitter Scott Fortune, who was a reserve for Team USA at Seoul last 
summer. "They were expected to meet in the final. It's the same scenario with 
UCLA and us. 
</P>
<P>
"We're even teams; I don't think anyone has an advantage over anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
With its win over Penn State, UCLA extended to 19 games its unbeaten streak in 
playoff games at Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Stanford is hoping to recapture the form that propelled the Cardinal 
to a three-game victory over the Bruins on April 19 during Western 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. competition. 
</P>
<P>
But to do that, Stanford will have to beat a determined Bruin team that looked 
overpowering against Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's impossible not to have them (Stanford) in the back of our minds," 
UCLA hitter Trevor Schirman said. "but we made it a point to come out here and 
beat Penn State first." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA hit .419 and committed just 16 errors while dominating the 11th-ranked 
Nittany Lions from the outset. Matt Whitaker led UCLA with a match-high 21 
kills and an attack percentage of .690. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chase had 17 kills for Penn State, which hit just .179. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight was a very good team effort," UCLA Coach Al Scates said. "there was 
good blocking, and we're going to need it against Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, which qualified for its first Final Four appearance by beating 
defending national champion USC and Hawaii last weekend, served and passed 
inconsistently early in its two-hour match with ninth-ranked Ball State. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune had a match-high 29 kills, and Dan Hanan added 18 for the Cardinal. The 
two players, both 6-foot-6, also presented a formidable blocking barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State's Kevin Furnish, who entered the match as the nation's leading 
hitter (.454) was limited to eight kills and an attack percentage of just .160.

CHILE'S DEFENDERS STIFLE GUATEMALA FOR 1-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's too bad that Bob Gansler, coach of the United States soccer team didn't 
get to see Friday night's match between Guatemala and Chile at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Gansler could have learned from watching Chile win, 1-0, because Guatemala is 
one of the teams that the United States will face in World Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
Sigi Schmidt, UCLA soccer coach, scouted the match for the U.S. and will brief 
Gansler, who'll be here for Sunday's match between Guatemala and Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game Friday night, Paraguay defeated El Salvador, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
How did the Chileans neutralize Guatemala? 
</P>
<P>
They used an elastic 4-4-2 formation to control the midfield and the match. 
Chile absorbed relentless offensive presssure from Guatemala, which wasted 
three good scoring chances in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes into the match, forward Raul Chacon missed a shot at a 
wide-open net. Chacon beat a Chilean defender one on one, but his shot sailed 
wide left. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala had another good chance in the 21st minute when forward Edwin 
Westphal set up midfielder Marvin Ceballos, but Chilean goalie Roberto Rojas, 
who spent much of the match roaming out of the goal, deflected Ceballos' shot. 
</P>
<P>
Westphal had Guatemala's best chance, but Rojas deflected Westphal's scissors 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, who diagrammed Chile's zone defense of Guatemala, said: "(Guatemala) 
played well the first half but they weren't lucky enough to get a couple of 
goals. They were much less effective in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, there was more action in the stands, where fights broke out 
among fans who set off fireworkds, than there was on the field. 
</P>
<P>
The game's only goal came in the 67th minute when forward Ruben Martinez scored 
on an 18-yard shot into the left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
That was the best moment for Chile, which appears to be rebuilding with young 
players. The Chileans, playing their second game in three nights, were unable 
to sustain an attack. Chile beat Guadalajara, 2-1, Wednesday night at the Santa 
Ana Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala had just one good scoring chance in the second half, but Rojas made a 
nice save on a free kick by defender Alejandro Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament concludes Sunday with Guatemala playing Paraguay at 4:30 p.m., 
followed by a match between El Salvador and Chile at 6:30. Guatemala and El 
Salvador will not meet because they are in the same qualifying group for the 
1990 World Cup.

TWO JOCKEYS HOSPITALIZED FOLLOWING FOUR-HORSE SPILL AT HOLLYWOOD PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two jockeys were hospitalized Friday following a four-horse spill near the end 
of the sixth race at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis, suffering possible head and neck injuries, was taken to Centinela 
Hospital Medical Center and was to remain overnight for precautionary reasons, 
a track spokesman said. Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye also was brought to the 
hospital but left a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Baino Park, a 4-year-old ridden by Delahoussaye, was running second to eventual 
winner Waterscape before appearing to snap her left foreleg just a few strides 
from the finish. Delahoussaye was thrown from his mount, triggering the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Solis and Valentine Wine were next to go down, followed by Chris McCarron and 
Son Of One, then Henry Garcia and Singaroundtheworld. McCarron, who suffered 
cuts on his nose and cheek, and Garcia, who bruised his forehead, walked away 
from the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Baino Park was humanely destroyed after being removed from the track by 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park Medical Director Dr. Robert Kerlan said Solis, 25, was conscious 
when he was placed on a stretcher and taken to the hospital by ambulance. There 
was no sign of paralysis, Kerlan added.

NEW COWBOY LEADERSHIP TO EVALUATE TIES TO CLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Dallas Cowboys come to Thousand Oaks this summer, they are going to 
need name tags. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are: 
</P>
<P>
Tom Landry, the coach. 
</P>
<P>
Tex Schramm, team president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Brandt, vice president in charge of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
And, are the Cowboys also gone? 
</P>
<P>
Don't rule it out. The team will arrive in July for training camp at Cal 
Lutheran University, just as it has for the previous 26 summers. But after 
that, all bets are off. 
</P>
<P>
When Arkansas oilman Jerry Jones purchased the club from H. R. (Bum) Bright 
several months ago, he brought a broom along with his checkbook. Now that the 
head rolling apparently is over, evaluations of the entire operation will 
begin, CLU as a training site among them. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed by contract to go to Thousand Oaks this year," Cowboy 
spokesman Greg Aiello said. "But we are not committing to anything long-term. 
We are not in a position to do that. The new owner and (new Coach) Jimmy 
Johnson have to study training camp and see what it is all about. They want to 
look at all facets of it before they decide what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Several factors would appear to favor CLU. One is the climate. Should the 
Cowboys decide to remain in Texas to train, they would be subjected to 
blistering heat and humidity. But Johnson already has said that such weather 
might be beneficial to the team's conditioning program. 
</P>
<P>
The other factor is the proximity of the Raiders, Rams and San Diego Chargers. 
Said Aiello: "With the new rule allowing only 80 players in camp, it is very 
helpful to have other teams in your area to practice against." 
</P>
<P>
The current agreement between the university and the Cowboys includes a 
two-year separation agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"That means that if either party notifies the other by September 1 that they 
want out, the Cowboys would still be coming back at least two more summers," 
said Dennis Gillette, CLU vice president for institutional advancement. "If 
circumstances change, and either party wants to do anything else, we would hold 
discussions and try to reach an equitable agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The college receives 20% above expenditures from the Cowboys every summer, a 
sum that comes to several thousand dollars. Should the Cowboys leave, that 
money would not necessarily be cut off. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had inquiries from several other teams," Gillette said. "Everything is 
here: dorms, practice fields, locker facilities, climate, location. This 
training-camp site is one of the best in the country." 
</P>
<P>
An interested club might be the Cowboys' summer neighbors, the Raiders, who 
reportedly are unhappy with their current training site in Oxnard because of 
the cool summer weather.

OUTCOME ONLY CONSIDERATION FOR KENNEDY IN 15-12 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it was a convenient case of collective memory loss for a Kennedy High 
team that has certainly played better. The final score didn't seem to stick in 
the players' minds. And, neither did the play of the defense. Or pitching. 
</P>
<P>
So what was the final tally? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know and I don't care," shortstop Gino Tagliaferri said. "As long as 
we got that W." 
</P>
<P>
Any other guesses? What about management? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Coach Manny Alvarado admitted. "All I knew was how much of a 
pad, or not a pad, we had every inning." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, indeed, did a launching-pad number on visiting Chatsworth, fighting 
back again and again for a 15-12 win in a 3-hour, 21-minute Northwest Valley 
Conference game in which the lead changed hands four times. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (17-6, 11-3 in league play), which was no-hit Tuesday by Chatsworth's 
Derek Wallace, racked up 17 hits in six innings and eight of nine starters 
drove in at least one run. The Golden Cougars twice bombed Chatsworth junior 
right-hander Reed McMackin (7-2). In his first appearance, as a starter, 
McMackin was chased in the third after allowing five runs on six hits. 
</P>
<P>
By the time McMackin re-entered the game in the sixth inning, Chatsworth held a 
tenuous 12-11 lead, despite a pair of rocket-shot solo homers to left by 
Tagliaferri. The second time around was even worse for McMackin, but Chatsworth 
was out of pitching options. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not pitch well, and that's two bad outings in a row for Reed," 
Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano said. "And you know you're really pushing when you 
have to use him again, but that's all we could do." 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the sixth, McMackin walked Mike Murray and gave up a single to 
Pat DeBoer to put runners on first and second. McMackin managed to get 
Tagliaferri -- who already had recorded his third two-homer day of the year -- 
to foul off two pitches, then uncorked a wild pitch to advance the runners. 
With first base open, Lofrano ordered an intentional pass to Tagliaferri on a 
1-and-2 count, loading the bases for Garret Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who was three for four as he stepped in, drilled McMackin's first 
pitch into left to score Murray and DeBoer and give Kennedy a 13-12 lead. 
Travis Bourne followed with a two-run single to left that gave Kennedy some 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the seventh, Kennedy reliever Cody Beaumaster (2-1) hit Rich 
Aude, who had an inside-the-park grand slam in the fourth to give Chatsworth a 
short-lived 7-6 lead. Eric Johnson followed with a single one out later, but 
Kevin Chong grounded to Tagliaferri, who started a 6-4-3, game-ending double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out like puppies on Tuesday," said Tagliaferri, who has 10 home runs 
this season and 20 in his career. "We were scared. We had to battle back, 
battle back." 
</P>
<P>
And so will Chatsworth (18-5, 11-3), which remarkably, has lost three games in 
eight days and now leads Taft (14-9, 10-4) by one game heading into a West 
Valley League showdown at Taft on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've let it dwindle," Lofrano said of the team's lead in the standings. "We 
hit the ball real well this week, but the rest. . . . You can never have enough 
pitching. That's why they call it a staff."

To the average high school sports fan, Russell White of Crespi is the 
All-American tailback who rushed for a state-record 5,998 yards and scored 94 
touchdowns during his three-year varsity football career at the private boys' 
school in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
But White is also an incredibly talented track and field performer, one who has 
made more than one aficionado wonder how good he could have been if that sport 
was his No. 1 athletic endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"If track were his first love, he'd be unbelievable," Crespi track Coach Jim 
Benkert said. "The sky would be the limit. There's no telling how good he could 
be." 
</P>
<P>
White agreed, saying that he could "pretty much dominate if I concentrated on 
track all year." 
</P>
<P>
It would have been difficult to argue with those assessments after White won 
four individual events in the Del Rey League finals at Cal State Northridge on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
White took the 100 meters in 10.7 seconds, the 200 in a season best of 21.4, 
the long jump at 23 feet, 9 1/2 inches and the triple jump with a season best 
of 48-10 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
The performances in the 200 and both jumps were meet records, breaking marks 
that were set 13, 18 and eight years ago, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm really on top of things right now," said White, who placed 
eighth in the 200 at last year's state championships. "I feel like I'm ready to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
White's efforts were doubly impressive because he was virtually unchallenged in 
all four events. 
</P>
<P>
He won the 100 by three-tenths of a second, the 200 by 1.4 seconds, the long 
jump by more than two feet and the triple jump by more than seven feet. His 
efforts in the long and triple jumps moved him to seventh and fourth on this 
year's state list. 
</P>
<P>
"He's peaking perfectly," Benkert said. "He's really on top of his game." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Borquez of Alemany would probably agree with Benkert. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth in the 400 in last year's state meet, Borquez won that event in 48.4, 
and anchored the Indians' victorious 400- (42.7) and 1,600-meter (3:28.3) relay 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
However, he was no match for White in the 200, finishing second in 22.8. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, sophomore Ryan Kieling of Crespi defeated Mike Currey of St. 
Francis in the 110-meter high hurdles by one-tenth of a second in 15.1, and 
Rene Rigal of Loyola won the 800 (1:57.9) and 3,200 (10:02.3) meters.

EL CAMINO REAL REACHES .500 MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took three weeks and six consecutive victories, but El Camino Real High 
finally evened its record with an eight-inning, 8-7 win Friday over San 
Fernando in a Northwest Valley Conference game at El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores (7-7) handed San Fernando left-hander Hector De La Cruz 
(6-1) his first career loss and completed a two-game sweep of the Tigers. El 
Camino Real loaded the bases against De La Cruz in the eighth before junior 
catcher Bobby Kim singled off reliever Frank Serna to drive in Paul Geller with 
the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long mountain to climb," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said. "And 
we're still climbing it." 
</P>
<P>
Junior left-hander Ryan McGuire (3-1) survived a four-run first inning by San 
Fernando (15-5-1, 9-4-1) to post his third complete-game victory. McGuire 
struck out six and walked six. He also walked three times in four plate 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Sanchez had a run-scoring single as the Tigers capitalized on two El 
Camino Real errors in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the first, the Conquistadores scored five times with two out. 
Steve Smith and Patrick Treend each delivered two-run singles, and Donny 
Chelius added a run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real added two runs in the second and took a 7-6 lead into the fourth 
before San Fernando's Andrew Munoz lofted a sacrifice fly to score Richard 
Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
In another Northwest Valley Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
Taft 5, Cleveland 3 -- Cleveland led, 3-0, in the first inning and chased 
starter Scott Tiano before an out had been recorded. But the Toreadors rallied 
to clinch second place and move to within a game of first-place Chatsworth in 
the West Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
The win earned Taft (14-9, 10-4) its first playoff berth since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Benji Belfield (5-2) replaced Tiano and pitched the remainder of the 
game, striking out four and walking three. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Nahmias, who was two for three, had run-scoring singles in the second and 
third innings. Belfield was one for three with two runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY PAC-8 CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
Poly 4, Monroe 1 -- Poly (15-6, 11-3) scored four times in the first inning and 
thwarted a seventh-inning Monroe rally to complete a two-game sweep of the 
visiting Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Eduardo Castellanos (1-0) struck out two and yielded seven hits before 
Monroe (9-9, 7-7) scored an unearned run in the seventh. Reliever Eddie Chavez, 
who entered with one out and runners at first and third, struck out John 
Langley, then induced Tim Costic to ground to second baseman Adulfo Hernandez, 
who threw out Ernie Echeveste, trying to score from third. 
</P>
<P>
Grant 11, Van Nuys 3 -- Javier Delahoya was five for five with two triples, 
four RBIs and two runs scored to lead Grant (13-4, 10-3). Grant's Hugo 
Valenzuela pitched a four-hitter, striking out six and walking four. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Bejines drove in two runs for Van Nuys (6-8) with a sixth-inning single. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 7, Reseda 6 -- Despite outhitting Sylmar 17-5, the host Regents lost for 
the 10th consecutive time. Reseda (4-13, 1-12) made five errors, and pitcher 
Joey Arnold walked 11. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar (15-3, 12-2) took a 6-5 lead in the sixth when shortstop Ron Stricklin's 
error allowed Dereck Ornelas to score. 
</P>
<P>
Stricklin had four hits, and Tuti Rodriguez and Louis Vanacore each had three. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 15, North Hollywood 6 -- The Braves' Danny Larson tripled and 
doubled, drove in four runs and scored three as Birmingham (7-11, 5-9) had 13 
hits at North Hollywood (3-15, 3-11). Birmingham's Ernesto Alvarez had three 
hits and two RBIs.

VALLEY'S GOAL AGAINST VENTURA: LET'S PLAY TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a simple case of making the best of what looks like a bad situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley College baseball team will travel to Ventura today for what it hopes 
will be two games in the final round of the Western State Conference playoff 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs (29-10-1) must sweep a doubleheader from conference co-champion 
Ventura (28-9) to qualify as the conference's top-seeded team in the state 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The first game starts at noon with a second game, should Valley win the opener, 
immediately following. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel OK because we've been able to establish a little momentum," said Valley 
Coach Chris Johnson, whose team defeated Oxnard and Moorpark this week to earn 
a shot at Ventura. "In a situation where we have to go to their yard and beat 
them twice, which on the surface isn't such a good situation, I feel pretty 
good about our chances." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which received a bye into the final round, has been idle for a week. 
Coach Gary Anglin said that his players are eager to play. 
</P>
<P>
"They're rested and ready," Anglin said. "The week off gave us a chance to rest 
our arms a little bit and heal up any nicks or bruises." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura has won three of the five meetings between the teams this season, 
including both conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, however, proved during the San Bernardino tournament in February that 
it is capable of sweeping Ventura. After losing to Ventura in the second round, 
Valley came back to take two games from the Pirates and win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, neither Johnson nor Anglin had decided who would pitch in today's 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, however, is expected to start either right-hander Shane Espitia, who 
has beaten Valley twice, or left-hander Dean McMillin, who has never faced the 
Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
Valley will go with Tim DeGrasse, Mike Roberts or Dean Money. 
</P>
<P>
A key for Valley will be whether it can sustain the level of play defensively 
that it exhibited this week against Oxnard and Moorpark. The Monarchs played 
virtually error-free baseball -- something they did not do in their losses to 
Ventura.

CHATSWORTH CYCLIST 38TH IN TOUR DE TRUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Tomac of Chatsworth placed 38th and David Brinton of North Hollywood 
finished 88th as the $250,000 Tour de Trump, the richest bicycle race in U. S. 
history, began Friday with a two-mile prologue in Albany, N. Y. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac was timed in four minutes, 48.76 seconds and Brinton in 5:07.66 over a 
course that took the 114 riders past the governor's mansion to the state 
capitol. 
</P>
<P>
A third Valley-area cyclist, Thurlow Rogers of Van Nuys, withdrew before the 
start of the event. A race spokesman said that Rogers was suffering from a 
combination of illness and injury. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Craven of Winston-Salem, N.C., placed first (4:34.55) in the race to 
determine the leader for today's first official stage.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS USE HOME RUNS TO SWEEP BYU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The knock against San Diego State's baseball team this season has been its lack 
of power. Tell that to Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs swept a Western Athletic Conference doubleheader Friday from BYU, 
6-2 and 7-6, by hitting four home runs in the first game and three in the 
second, including Brian Lutes' game-winning three-run homer in the top of 
seventh and final inning. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into another doubleheader against BYU today in Provo, SDSU is 33-20, 
14-6. BYU fell to 40-14, 18-7. The Aztecs, BYU and Hawaii (35-19, 17-5) are 
battling for first place in the WAC with six games remaining for each. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU trailed, 6-2, entering the seventh of the second game. After Brian Dunn 
reached base on an error, and Jeff Barry singled with one out, Harry Henderson 
singled in Dunn. One out later, Lutes homered to center to give the Aztecs a 
7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
John Marshall (3-3) was the winner in relief. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Henderson, Billy Miller (three for three), Anthony Johnson 
(three for three) and Barry hit home runs, accounting for all six runs. Rob 
Brown (9-4) pitched a four-hitter, struck out seven and yielded just one earned 
run. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego scored four runs in the bottom of the eighth to 
escape with a 9-8 victory. Chris Stout (three hits) and Parris Sarianell (two 
doubles) led USD (22-30-1). Riverside scored five runs in the ninth. James 
Ferguson came in with one out in the ninth to pick up his third save. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Bernardino defeated Point Loma Nazarene, 6-2, in a nonconference 
game. Senior Tony Nobinsky had an RBI and scored a run for PLNC, which finished 
the year 20-28 overall. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International University swept a nonconference doubleheader from Southern 
Utah State, 13-3 and 14-1, at USIU. The Gulls' Kevin Tahan was five for eight 
with a home run, his 15th, and nine RBIs in the two games. 
</P>
<P>
Beto Rodriguez was four for four with three doubles and a triple in the first 
game, which was won by starter Mike Whisonant (6-5) with a four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Moutaw was four for six, and Jeff Oswalt (6-7) the winner in the second 
game. USIU improved to 20-32. Southern Utah State is 21-29. 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego will send two players into the NCAA Division I 
individual tennis tournament to be held at the University of Florida in 
Gainesville beginning May 15. Jennifer Larking (17-7), ranked 30th in the 
nation, will play in both the singles and doubles. Aby Brayton will be 
Larking's partner in doubles. The two have compiled a 14-6 record this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Point Loma Nazarene women head into today's final day of the NAIA District 
3 Championship Tournament tied for first place with Westmont College. Both have 
12 points. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles, Kim Wright and Shannon Anderson will play Carolyn Clayton and 
Lelisa Wolters of Westmont, which is hosting the tournament on its Santa 
Barbara campus. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McDonald of San Diego advanced to the semifinal round in the Men's 70s 
division of the National Hardcourt Tennis Championships at the La Jolla Beach 
and Tennis Club. McDonald defeated Bernie Terrell of El Cajon, 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's 60s, Liz Harper of La Jolla topped her quarterfinal opponent, 
Dot Hogan of Encinitas, 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S GOLF 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's men's golf team fell from first to third in the second round 
of the Western Athletic Conference's golf championships in Albuquerque. The 
Aztecs shot a 295 in the second round for a 585 total. With two rounds to go, 
they trail host New Mexico (575) and Texas El Paso (577).

WRESTLING WITH GHOSTS IN 'THE PIANO LESSON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In no particular order, but rather like the pieces of a giant puzzle, August 
Wilson is committed to writing a series of plays chronicling black life in 
different decades of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"The Piano Lesson," which opened Thursday at the Old Globe, is No. 4 -- in 
terms of public presentation if not of writing order. It takes care of the '30s 
and constitutes another buoyant and engrossing story, again with a suspenseful 
plot and metaphysical edge, set in an iconographic reality. 
</P>
<P>
After "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," "Fences" and "Joe Turner's Come and Gone," 
one begins to discern in "Piano Lesson" what you might call the Wilson style: 
the presentation of story (as opposed to text), with complex sub-stories -- 
parenthetical and tangential -- all of which feed like streams into the river 
that is his play. 
</P>
<P>
The surprising result, within the traditional framework of a verbal/linear 
event, is transcendental kitchen-sink drama. Through diurnal banalities, Wilson 
probes a complex network of African and American roots. It's like listening to 
an ancient troubadour tell a tale of cross-cultural heritage and mythology with 
the habit of an old poet who has traded his rhyming dictionary for a stage. 
</P>
<P>
The genealogy of "The Piano Lesson" is sufficiently ramified to require a 
blueprint (which the program at the Globe charitably supplies). We're invited 
into the parlor and kitchen of Doaker (Paul Butler), a retired railroad man who 
shares his Pittsburgh home with his widowed niece Berniece (S. Epatha 
Merkerson) and her 11-year-old daughter, Maretha (Melissa Bess Wright). 
</P>
<P>
The parlor's centerpiece is an old carved piano belonging to Berniece and her 
brother Boy Willie (Charles S. Dutton). Berniece and Boy Willie's 
great-grandmother and her 9-year-old son were traded for that piano by a slave 
owner named Sutter, and the carvings on it are the work of the 
great-grandfather who was left behind. 
</P>
<P>
After Emancipation, the piano was stolen from the Sutter home by the grandsons, 
one of whom -- Berniece's and Willie Boy's father -- paid with his life. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of "Piano Lesson" is the struggle between Berniece and Boy Willie over 
the piano's fate. Sutter has died and Boy Willie has a chance to buy his land. 
For Boy Willie it's poetic vindication and escape from slavery -- the slavery 
of working for others. He wants to sell the piano to raise the cash he needs, 
but Berniece won't do it. 
</P>
<P>
For Berniece the piano is a totem filled with ancestral ghosts. And to 
complicate matters, she holds the blowhard Boy Willie responsible for her own 
husband's death. As the bickering mounts, the bad blood between them boils. 
</P>
<P>
Other characters play into this drama: Berniece's suitor, Avery (Tommy Hollis), 
a self-anointed preacher with a knack for divine self-justification; Willie 
Boy's buddy Lymon (Rocky Carroll), sweet-tempered and laid back; Grace (Tonya 
Pinkins), a defiant woman picked up and wooed by Lymon and Boy Willie; the 
happy-go-lucky Wining Boy (Lou Myers), Doaker's brother -- and, occasionally, a 
ghost at the top of the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's interweaving of agendas and temperaments, his ear for the shaggy-dog 
humor and richness of the most casual and most charged exchanges, climax into a 
second act of tremendous power. But, as in "Joe Turner," there is a sudden 
dropping of detail in final moments that's as maddening as it is inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, what happens to the piano is unresolved. We know it plays an 
intense role in Boy Willie's final confrontation with Sutter's ghost, but we're 
left wondering who wins, who loses and whether Boy Willie ever gets his land. 
</P>
<P>
Everything up to that point has been so cleverly calibrated that Wilson's 
decision to leave these questions unanswered feels like an unconsummated act. 
</P>
<P>
Questionable on a purely functional level is the remanding of Maretha to her 
room as matters lurch toward their explosive end. The child was terrified by 
Sutter's ghost in Act I. Why, in Act II, send her to what becomes the 
battlefield for Boy Willie and the ghost? 
</P>
<P>
Except for this minor bleep, Lloyd Richards, who staged this Yale Repertory 
Theatre production, has marshaled a superior cast with the same brio that made 
such powerful presentations of the first three Wilson plays. Dutton delivers a 
staggering performance as Boy Willie. Hefty and flinty and loud, he's a tower 
of numbing, nonstop babble and unquenchable energy who mows down everything in 
his path. 
</P>
<P>
Production values are adequate and appropriate, with E. David Cosier Jr.'s 
sparsely furnished set reflecting the economic bleakness and hard-won 
respectability of the inhabitants. A word of special commendation for Dwight D. 
Andrews' musical contributions. One of the show's highlights is some soulful a 
cappella singing in Act I. 
</P>
<P>

JOSE CARRERAS REPAYS A PERSONAL DEBT IN SEATTLE

He came back. He sang. He conquered. 
</P>
<P>
The drama at the Seattle Opera House on Thursday involved an opera star. But 
the event wasn't an opera. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the plot resembled a soap opera. It stretched credibility right up to 
the seemingly happy end. But this was non-fiction. 
</P>
<P>
This was a drama of bravery bolstered by idealism and sensitivity. This, if you 
will, was the Jose Carreras story. 
</P>
<P>
Carreras, whose popularity places him right after Luciano Pavarotti and Placido 
Domingo in the international supertenor sweepstakes, was stricken late in 1987 
with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The prognosis was not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting medical experts in his native Barcelona, Carreras decided to 
undergo the rigors of an autologous bone-marrow transplant at a pioneering 
facility in Seattle, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. When he was 
released, 14 months ago, he promised to return to sing a benefit recital for 
the institution that apparently had saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, with a little help from the Seattle Opera, he made good on that 
promise. Having ventured a dozen concert appearances in Europe, he chose this 
city for his American comeback. Engagements in New York and Washington are 
scheduled later this month. 
</P>
<P>
No one knew quite what to expect when Carreras made his brisk, self-effacing 
entrance. Everyone was prepared to be indulgent. Standing ovations and floral 
tributes were foregone conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The hero, now 42, looked a bit gaunt and pale. His courtly manner was 
contradicted by a scruffy Don Johnson beard-in-progress, cultivated no doubt to 
camouflage a recent bout with chicken pox. Even with the leukemia in remission, 
his immune system remains severely compromised. 
</P>
<P>
When he began to sing, it became clear to 3,000 adoring fans -- many of whom 
had paid $100 for a ticket -- that Carreras would require no apologies. This 
program would be an artistic experience, not just a sentimental exercise. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, his voice sounded fresher, brighter, more sensuous and more 
lustrous than it had been just before his illness. This was one advantageous 
byproduct of the enforced period of rest. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, Carreras had confounded even his most doting admirers by 
assuming heavyweight roles that threatened severe vocal damage. Having 
persuaded the lyric tenor to undertake Radames in "Aida," Herbert von Karajan 
next wanted him to attempt an even more dubious challenge: Verdi's Otello. The 
result could have been disastrous, a replay of the pathetic Giuseppe di Stefano 
saga. 
</P>
<P>
On this blissful occasion, Carreras certainly did not sound like a tenor in any 
kind of trouble. Wisely, he avoided arias and concentrated on a relatively easy 
agenda of songs. Deftly accompanied by Lorenzo Bavaj, he performed them 
exquisitely. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from one smashing B-flat at encore time, he avoided stratospheric 
flights. No matter. He sang with abiding pathos, disarming charm, considerable 
finesse. 
</P>
<P>
A critical churl might have noted a weak trill in the bel-canto repertory or 
some distortions of the French idiom in obligatory melodies of Faure and 
Duparc. Such passing blemishes seemed irrelevant, however, in light of 
Carreras' expressive eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
It will be impossible to forget the suavity with which he delineated Bellini's 
"Malinconia" or the perfectly tapered pianissimo phrases with which he ennobled 
the sentiment of Tosti's "Ideale." Few singers can equal his poise and passion 
in music of Turina and Falla. 
</P>
<P>
His command of the telling nuance and his ability to spin endlessly graceful 
legato phrases elevates even a vulgar indulgence to high art. He can turn a 
simple canzone such as Tosti's "Non t'amo piu" into a study of bittersweet 
ardor. 
</P>
<P>
To close the formal portion of the program, Carreras offered some Puccini 
teasers: "Solo e amore," which foreshadows the "Boheme" quartet, and "Menti 
all'avviso," which invokes "Donna non vidi mai" in "Manon Lescaut." These 
subtle previews served as intriguing down payments on his return to bona fide 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
May it be soon. May it even take him to Los Angeles. He has come a long way 
since he sang a cautious Cavaradossi to the steely Tosca of Birgit Nilsson at 
the Music Center in 1974. 
</P>

FACES. . .: AN ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Confession time over tea. British singer Corinne Drewery, of the pop group 
Swing Out Sister, reveals one of the most unsettling moments of her life: 
</P>
<P>
"It was when I finally realized I wasn't a soul singer," says Drewery, best 
known for "Breakout," the Top 10 single from the group's 1987 debut album, 
"It's Better to Travel." 
</P>
<P>
Drewery, 30, spent her late teens copying R&amp;B singers such as Marvin Gaye, 
Diana Ross and Stevie Wonder. During her aborted soul-singing attempts, she 
ignored certain signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Like the fact that I'm white, English and don't have any soul," she deadpans. 
"I thought to myself: 'Now what do I do?' " 
</P>
<P>
Keyboard player Andy Connell and drummer Martin Jackson, who formed Swing Out 
Sister with her in 1983, advised her to sing naturally and not copy anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Great advice, as it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly thanks to Drewery's vocals, the band's first PolyGram album, "It's 
Better to Travel," sold more than 700,000 copies. The new Swing Out album, 
"Kaleidoscope World," is due out in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
She has a wispy, exotic voice, sounding somewhat like June Christy, the superb 
'40s ballad singer. Drewery's voice, quite unlike any other in pop music today, 
has a gossamer texture -- tailor-made for romantic songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I do," she says when asked to describe her singing. Then, 
pointing to her chest: "I just sing, from somewhere down here." 
</P>
<P>
Swing Out Sister's mainstream success is a big surprise because of its strong 
jazz influence -- usually the kiss of death in pop circles. "We use rhythms in 
a very modern way," she says. "There's a strong contemporary feel. That's 
stronger than the jazz feel. People really respond to the rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
As terrific as Drewery's voice is, though, she confesses that she would gladly 
trade it in. 
</P>
<P>
For what? 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to sing like Stevie Wonder or Diana Ross." DENNIS HUNT

LITTLE GIRL MUST FACE A NEW DADDY IN HER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How's a kid to cope when Mom plans to remarry? That's the subject of today's 
animated "Wonderworks" offering for young children, "Two Daddies?" (7 p.m. on 
Channels 28 and 50, 8 p.m. on Channel 15). 
</P>
<P>
A sequel to "Happily Ever After," a 1985 "Wonderworks" about Molly, a little 
girl whose mom and dad divorce, this low-key parenting primer catches up with 
Molly a year later, tentatively adjusted to her new way of life. But when Mom 
starts dating and then announces plans to marry Michael, Molly's world is 
shaken again. 
</P>
<P>
Animator Bill Melendez, of TV's "Peanuts" cartoons, created the talking-head 
"Peanuts"-like characters here, given voices by Danny DeVito, Carrie Fisher, 
Richard Masur, Rhea Perlman, Henry Winkler (who was also the program's 
executive producer) and, as Molly, Christina Lange. 
</P>
<P>
Children unfamiliar with the situation in which Molly finds herself may not 
want to go the whole 60 minutes. It's not Saturday morning cartoon time; the 
message is the thing. 
</P>
<P>
But children and parents whose concerns are targeted, tune in. Written by Ron 
Friedman, Mal Malmorstein and Linda Balahoutis, this thoughtful hour shows how, 
even in ideal circumstances -- ex-spouses behaving as friends and a wise 
stepfather-to-be -- children of divorce have special anxieties that need to be 
addressed. LYNNE HEFFLEY

ESQUIRE TO AIR ITS VERSION OF THE AMERICAN MALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women: Did you know that men are slobs? That they're really just little boys? 
That they have no trouble sharing their feelings? 
</P>
<P>
No? Then tune into "Esquire: About Men, for Women," a 13-part Lifetime cable 
channel series from Esquire magazine, with its self-proclaimed "authoritative 
view of the American male," beginning tonight at 10:30. Each program has four 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
In "Coversations," you'll "eavesdrop" on the "innermost feelings" of four men 
"privately" rapping (on camera) about marriage, parenthood, sex, genital size 
and being short. 
</P>
<P>
You'll get the inside scoop in "Celebrity Interviews," where celebrity 
interviewer Ali MacGraw awkwardly talks to -- you guessed it -- male 
celebrities. (When Troy Donahue tells of meeting a teen-age son he didn't know 
he had, she breathes, "Oh, wow.") 
</P>
<P>
You'll hear "secrets" on "Byline," with humorists joshing about sloppiness and 
the "new cheating." If women knew what men really did during the day, "they'd 
hate them as a species even more than they do," says Marty Goldensohn. (He's 
just joking, right?) 
</P>
<P>
On "Documentary," you'll see men relate experiences with second families and 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
On the first show, Linda Ellerbee spices things up. What does she want to know 
about men? "Not a damn thing," she deadpans, "having married several and raised 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's all meant to be lighthearted, and some of it is enjoyable and rings 
true. But it also generalizes (do all men love baseball?), perpetuates 
stereotypes and patronizes its audience. When glossy, fashion-statement host 
Matt Lauer winsomely confides, "We all know men are slobs," he doesn't bat a 
well-groomed eyelash. 
</P>
<P>
You know the guy at parties who thinks calculated "sensitivity" is a great way 
to score with women? Some TV producers seem to have the same idea. LYNNE

ABC resumes its megaseries "War and Remembrance" on Sunday at 8 p.m 
(7)(3)(10)(42). The concluding chapters to the $110-million production 
(reviewed by Howard Rosenberg on Page 1) star Jane Seymour and John Gielgud. 
</P>

NBC once again resurrects some television past with "The Trial of the 
Incredible Hulk" at 9 p.m. (4)(36)(39). Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno return in 
their former roles. CBS (2)(8) opts at 9 p.m. for Harrison Ford and Kelly 
McGillis in their 1985 romantic thriller "Witness." 
</P>

Earlier Sunday, classical music will fill the small screen as "Live From 
Lincoln Center" presents the 20th anniversary concert by the Chamber Music

EASY GOER CAN SAVE THE WEEK;

VICTORY BY FAVORITE WOULD BE FIRST DERBY ACTIVITY TO GO RIGHT

LOUISVILLE, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been one bummer after another lately for the good burghers of this Ohio 
River town. 
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, the Derby Balloon Race was canceled because of high winds. 
One entrant had driven here all the way from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the $2.9-million Louisville Falls Fountain, the lighted river attraction 
advertised as the world's largest floating fountain, was knocked out of 
commission when underwater debris clogged its pipes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Derby Steamboat Race, the Louisville Belle was beaten badly by the 
invader, Delta Queen. There was no exacta betting. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, the Pegasus Parade, a Derby tradition, was held in a steady 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
But today is Kentucky Derby day, No. 115 in the series, and the residents are 
determined to turn things around for the 125,000 or so -- most of them visitors 
-- who will cram historic, gussied-up Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
If Easy Goer wins, many of them will go home singing into their mint juleps, 
because most of the money will be bet on that brilliant 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer has won seven of his nine races and is being described as the best 
candidate to sweep the Triple Crown since Spectacular Bid won the 1979 Derby. 
Spectacular Bid also won the Preakness, then finished third in the Belmont 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
This Derby is being called a two-horse race, despite the presence of 14 other 
3-year-olds. Support has built in recent weeks for Sunday Silence, the Santa 
Anita Derby winner who came here as a good horse and seems to have trained into 
a better one. 
</P>
<P>
He and Easy Goer have never run against one another, though, so there is no way 
to gauge them. Easy Goer has won three straight races as a 3-year-old and was 
never really pressed in any of them. Sunday Silence also has won all three of 
his races this year and overall is four for six, with two second-place 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Another $2.9-million attraction -- Houston -- figures to be a factor in the 1 
1/4-mile Derby, and although he was soundly beaten by Sunday Silence at Santa 
Anita, trainer Wayne Lukas is typically confident. 
</P>
<P>
One thing certain about Houston, he will be in front for much of the race. Even 
though there are other speed horses in the field, they are what's known on the 
backstretch as cheap speed. After their initial bursts, they run out of gas, 
and heaven help a horse and jockey running close behind a horse that stops in 
the Derby. They don't just slow down, they almost come to a full stop. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham, the wily trainer who won the Derby with longshot Ferdinand 
in 1986, gives Easy Goer his due, but Whittingham believes that his horse -- 
Sunday Silence -- has faced stronger opposition in California than Easy Goer 
has encountered in New York. 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely the reason why Ben Perkins Sr. and his trainer son are here 
with Faultless Ensign, who is 50-1 in the morning line. Easy Goer and his 
entrymate, Awe Inspiring, were 3-5 before Friday's advance Derby betting began, 
but at the end of the day the entry was listed at even money. Sunday Silence is 
the 3-1 second choice based on Friday's betting, and the entry of Houston and 
Shy Tom is next at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Easy Goer deserves the respect he's gotten but he hasn't beaten a good horse 
yet," Perkins said. "He's got his work cut out for him. I know Sunday Silence 
is a good horse, and Lukas can't be that wrong about Houston." 
</P>
<P>
A strong possibility is Houston establishing an early lead while posting quick 
fractions, with Sunday Silence staying close to his pace and Easy Goer lurking 
not far behind the first two. How far Easy Goer trails early will probably be 
up to his jockey, Pat Day. In winning the Wood Memorial two weeks ago, the son 
of Alydar showed that he has a nice early lick, too. 
</P>
<P>
The weatherman keeps changing his mind, but if the latest forecast is correct, 
Churchill Downs might have its first off track for the Derby since Dust 
Commander won in the mud here in 1970. It rained Thursday and Friday, and 
there's a 40% chance for more rain this morning and this afternoon. The 
temperature probably won't get above 55. 
</P>
<P>
It could be a day not unlike the Breeders' Cup last November, when Easy Goer 
suffered one of his two defeats, losing to Is It True by 1 1/4 lengths in the 
mud at 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Day didn't like his ride that day, and Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer, 
didn't like the track. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a lot of muddy tracks here but never one like that day," McGaughey 
said. "Usually, this is a good track, even when it rains. They didn't harrow 
the track that day, and it made a difference. I don't think they'll make the 
same mistake again, and this colt should handle it better if it's off." 
</P>
<P>
A son of Halo, Sunday Silence is considered a good off-track horse. He won 
comfortably on a sloppy track at Santa Anita in March. 
</P>
<P>
After the big two and Houston, the field is heavy with horses whose trainers 
were brought here kicking and screaming by their owners. Dansil, Wind Splitter, 
Notation, Flying Continental, Irish Actor and even Awe Inspiring, McGaughey's 
other starter, are in that category. 
</P>
<P>
It has been written that Hawkster also qualifies for that group, but his owner, 
Shelly Meredith, bristles at the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron McAnally (Hawkster's trainer) had only one reservation about coming," 
Meredith said. "He told me how expensive it would be to come here, but as far 
as I was concerned, that could never be a consideration as long as you felt 
that you had a horse who belonged." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Murphy, the trainer who went until only a couple of days ago before he 
found a jockey -- Herb McCauley -- for Notation, was hardly diplomatic in 
indicating his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a jockey yet," Murphy said before he had hired McCauley. "The 
owners are the ones who want to run, let them get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Finishing second, third or fourth today might not make expenses. The winner 
gets $584,200 of the $759,200 pot, but payoffs for the other top finishers drop 
to $100,000, $50,000 and $25,000, respectively.

At 6 feet 8 inches, Vince Tjelmeland is the tallest professional race driver in 
the country, standing two inches higher than Chris Knievel, the Indy car and 
Trans Am driver who previously held that distinction in a sport of mostly 
jockey-sized competitors. 
</P>
<P>
T. J., as the Yorba Linda ultra-stock driver is better known, finds the 
circumstances amusing, and at times favorable. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can borrow my race car," he said during practice for tonight's Mickey 
Thompson Off-Road Gran Prix in the Rose Bowl. "They can't reach the pedals." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, when Dan Gurney, 6-2, was contracted to drive a sports car 
at LeMans, the builders made a bubble in the roof to accommodate Gurney's head. 
Tjelmeland did it differently. 
</P>
<P>
"They put a chair down in the garage, put me in it and built the car around 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tjelmeland will drive a Nissan Pulsar tonight in the ultra-stock race, a 
one-of-a-kind class developed by the late Mickey Thompson for stadium racing. 
The cars were designed to resemble drag racing's funny cars -- full-fledged 
race cars masquerading as passenger cars. 
</P>
<P>
After five races in the 10-event stadium series, Tjelmeland is leading with 
three wins and 200 points to 195 for defending champion Jeff Elrod of Campbell, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Racing will start with heats at 6:30 p.m.

China's superbly trained and conditioned divers easily won the team title in 
the World Cup Diving Championships Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Winning five of the six phases of competition for men and women -- one- and 
three-meter springboard and 10-meter platform -- the Chinese scored 579 points. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which beat China by two points for the title two years ago, 
had 552 and the Soviet Union was third with 521.

Gao Min, runner-up to teammate Yu Xiaoling in the women's one-meter team event 
Thursday, outclassed the three-meter field with 537.27 points. Soviet Svetlana 
Alexeeva had 491.76, followed by Wendy Lucero with 484.38.

<P>
Mike Tyson may be undefeated in the ring, but he's 0-2 against Albany police, 
who on Friday issued the heavyweight champion his second speeding ticket in 
nine days. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, whose career began in nearby Catskill, was ticketed shortly after 10 
a.m. for driving his 1989 Lamborghini at an imprudent speed, according to 
Albany police Sgt. Robert Wolfgang. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang said a police officer spotted Tyson's car and another vehicle 
exceeding the 30-m.p.h. speed limit while traveling east on Albany's Central 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a clocked situation, but the officer determined they were driving 
at a greater speed than is prudent for the traffic conditions," Wolfgang said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the other vehicle was identified as Jason Knell, 18, of Clifton 
Park. He was driving a 1989 Toyota, Wolfgang said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson and Knell are scheduled to appear May 23 in Albany Traffic Court, 
Wolfgang said. 
</P>
<P>
Police issued Tyson a speeding ticket April 26 for driving 71 m.p.h. while 
racing his Lamborghini against a friend on Central Avenue. He is scheduled to 
appear in court Tuesday for that incident, police said.

NEWSWIRE: SOVIET DEFECTOR ARRIVES IN BUFFALO; SABRES DENY ACCUSATION OF 
'PIRACY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny, the first member of the Soviet National team to defect to 
the West, arrived in Buffalo, where he hopes to continue his career with the 
Sabres in the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Sabre General Manager Gerry Meehan accompanied Mogilny from Stockholm after the 
the 20-year-old Soviet player decided to defect following the recent World 
Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Meehan denied an accusation made by the official Soviet news agency Tass that 
the Sabres were guilty of "piracy." 
</P>
<P>
"The Buffalo Sabres were totally open and above-board" in dealing with Mogilny, 
Meehan said Friday night, adding that the Sabres began talks with Mogilny "at 
the specific request of the player. It was a voluntary departure." 
</P>
<P>
Meehan would not say whether Mogilny had signed a contract and also declined 
comment on published reports that indicated a romantic relationship with an 
American woman may have been involved in the defection. 
</P>
<P>
Meehan admitted there are potential problems with international ice hockey 
officials, the NHL and American immigration officials that could keep Mogilny 
from playing for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say they (his chances of playing with Buffalo) are pretty good or 
pretty bad," he said. "There are hurdles that have to be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Koloskov, head of the soccer and hockey department of the State 
Sports Committee in the Soviet Union, indicated he expected no serious 
repercussions in relations between the Soviets and the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny was in his third year with the Red Army team and had played in 11 
international matches with the national team before this season. He was voted 
the world's best junior player earlier this year by NHL scouts in a poll 
organized by the Hockey News. 
</P>
<P>
But he had his troubles with Soviet hockey authorities. He was suspended for 10 
days before the World Championships after a fight in a Soviet league game.

DESPITE LIMITED SIGHT, HE EARNS DERBY CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOUISVILLE, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stewards have taken a harsh view of sight-impaired jockeys in the interest of 
the safety, but that hasn't stopped at least one from competing in the Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
And it won't hinder Jo Jo Ladner today at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
But Ladner, 24, knows that his mount, Northern Wolf, has little chance. 
</P>
<P>
The horse from Maryland has won two of his last three starts, the only times 
Ladner has ridden him, but he is a 50-1 shot in the Derby and must break from 
the outside post in the 16-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse hasn't faced the kind of competition he'll see in the Derby," said 
Ladner, who lost sight in one eye in an auto accident at the age of 2. "But 
it's still going to be exciting for me, getting a chance to ride in a race like 
this. I just hope the horse goes good and gives a good account of himself." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a chance for a sight-impaired jockey isn't as unusual as it is 
unadvertised. Though it wasn't well-known when he was active, Walter Blum, a 
Hall of Fame jockey, had sight in only one eye throughout his career. Blum 
finished fourth with Reason To Hail in 1967 and eighth with Royal and Regal in 
1973, his only Derby mounts. 
</P>
<P>
In Maryland in the 1960s, jockey Joe Momento had limited eyesight. He suffered 
an eye injury in a spill and thereafter the stewards wouldn't let him ride on 
muddy tracks because of the mud that flies into jockeys' faces and covers their 
protective goggles. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, an apprentice named Charles Fletcher was denied a riding 
license in Kentucky because of limited sight and his lawsuit to obtain one was 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fletcher case was something special," said Keene Daingerfield, the retired 
Kentucky steward who was presiding here at the time. "That boy was blind in one 
eye and had severe problems seeing in the other eye. I'm sure there'll be no 
problem with this boy from Maryland (Ladner) riding in the Derby. He's been 
licensed there, has been riding regularly and that should be good enough for 
Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
Ladner's mother and father and sister, who live in New Orleans, will be here 
today. Ladner flew here Thursday night from Baltimore, where he has been riding 
at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you staying?" Ladner was asked on the telephone before he left. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I don't have a room. But I imagine I'll be able to 
find one." 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Ladner, the jockey's father, is in the construction business in 
Louisiana. He was driving down an interstate highway 22 years ago with his 
brother, Jo Jo and a couple of his son's cousins. There was an accident on the 
opposite side, and one of the cars careened across the divider -- slamming into 
the Ladner vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Jo Ladner remembers little about the accident that cost him sight in one 
eye. All of the other injuries in his father's car were minor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never even asked if it was in the daytime or at night, come to think of 
it," Ladner said. 
</P>
<P>
Ladner says that he has virtually no sight in his right eye. Three times he 
tried having cornea transplants, the last time when he was 13, but none was 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, we gave up," Ladner said. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager Ladner was riding at bush tracks that didn't have parimutuel 
betting when he applied for his first state jockey's license at the Fair 
Grounds in New Orleans. The track doctor gave him his physical examination and 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"You've only got sight in one eye. You're crazy to think you can be a jockey." 
</P>
<P>
To which Ladner replied: "I'll be crazy if I can't ride." 
</P>
<P>
He was issued the license. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Ladner played baseball and football. He also rode in motocross 
competition and said he once finished 13th of 100 entrants in a national event 
at the Houston Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really had to make an adjustment because of riding with just the 
one good eye," Ladner said. "Since I've been like this practically all my life, 
I don't know any different. I don't know otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
At the start of his career, at Louisiana Downs, Ladner said he won only once in 
his first 80 races. So in 1982 he went to Maryland, where apprentice jockeys 
such as Chris McCarron, Ronnie Franklin and Kent Desormeaux had flourished. 
</P>
<P>
Ladner said he had fewer rides after his apprenticeship ended, but that he has 
made a comeback and currently ranks eighth at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
Like any young jockey, Ladner has been following the Kentucky Derby for some 
time and was especially thrilled in 1982 when Gato Del Sol, ridden by the 
transplanted California Cajun, Eddie Delahoussaye, pulled off an upset here. 
</P>
<P>
"My family knew Eddie in Louisiana," Ladner said. 
</P>
<P>
And, for Ladner, it was a bit of an upset that he even had a chance to ride in 
the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern Wolf's first seven races, Greg Hutton was the jockey. Before the 
Mister Diz Stakes at Laurel on March 24, Hutton told Hank Allen, Northern 
Wolf's trainer, that he had decided to ride Diamond Donnie, another Kentucky 
Derby candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Allen gave the mount to Ladner, who had been riding some of the trainer's other 
horses, and Northern Wolf won the Mister Diz by 12 lengths. Diamond Donnie ran 
next to last in the Wood Memorial and isn't running in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeled back a week after the Mister Diz, Northern Wolf tired under Ladner at 
Garden State Park and finished third in the Cherry Hill Mile. But then on April 
22 they won a 1 1/8-mile stake at Pimlico, and that was Northern Wolf's ticket 
to the Derby.

PRESIDIO PARK, MT. SOLEDAD; 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL ASSAULT ON CROSSES IS VOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego chapter of American Atheists says it will sue the city over a 
recent city attorney's opinion that crosses on Mt. Soledad, in La Jolla, and in 
Presidio Park, near Old Town, do not violate the Constitution's separation of 
church and state. 
</P>
<P>
"A legal opinion is just that . . . the city attorney's legal opinion," said 
Stephen Thorne, director of the local chapter of American Atheists. "The key 
thing is the city of San Diego doesn't have an exemption from the 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Thorne said his group, which is already fighting the city in federal court over 
a Nativity display at Balboa Park, intends to file another lawsuit in federal 
court over City Atty. John Witt's opinion on the crosses, issued a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
That opinion, said the city does not violate federal or state constitutions 
because "the purpose of each (cross) is secular, the primary effect neither 
advances nor inhibits religion and neither cross fosters an excessive 
entanglement by government with religion." Both crosses are on public land and 
maintained as part of a park. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office maintained that the Mt. Soledad cross has long been 
a memorial to American soldiers killed in World War I, II and the Korean War, 
an important legal point according to the opinion, which was written by Deputy 
City Atty. Mary Kay Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
In previous federal court cases, crosses on public land were designated as war 
memorials only after "complaints were received and a problem became apparent." 
In those instances, the courts ordered the crosses removed. 
</P>
<P>
The cross atop 822-foot-high Mt. Soledad, which provides spectacular views of 
the city and beyond, was erected in 1913 by private citizens. It was destroyed 
by vandals 10 years later but rebuilt by citizens. In 1952, a windstorm toppled 
the cross. The latest cross was put up by citizens in 1954, when it was 
dedicated as a war memorial. Mt. Soledad was dedicated in 1916 as a public park 
and remains a favorite tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cross at Presidio Park 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office maintains that the Presidio Park cross commemorates 
"the historical beginnings of the city of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The original cross at Presidio Park was dedicated by Father Junipero Serra as 
part of the founding of the Royal Presidio in 1769, the opinion noted. The 
existing cross was built in 1913 using brick from the original presidio. The 
land was given to the city by George Marston in 1930, when it became a public 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the cross was first erected by a Catholic priest, the city attorney 
says the purpose of the cross was to honor the founding of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The original settlement where the cross was first erected, as well as the city 
itself, was founded by religious people," the opinion says. "One cannot 
memorialize such people without including the artifacts they themselves 
utilized. The cross in Presidio (Park) was in place long before the city 
dedicated the property as parkland, or even acquired the land itself. The 
primary effect here is to commemorate the beginnings of San Diego, not to 
promote or inhibit any religion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Without Precedent 
</P>
<P>
The opinion notes, however, that there have been no U. S. Supreme Court cases 
dealing specifically with crosses on public lands. There are few state court 
cases anywhere in the country involving the issue of crosses, and none from the 
4th District Court of Appeal, which provides guidelines for state courts in San 
Diego. The California Supreme Court, in a 1978 decision, ruled that a cross 
attached to Los Angeles City Hall, which was lighted at Easter and Christmas, 
was a violation of the state constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of the crosses on Mt. Soledad and in Presidio Park was first raised 
by the American Atheist chapter in San Diego when the group complained to the 
city's Park and Recreation Department, which then asked for the city attorney's 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the city attorney was trying to find an excuse to keep these 
(crosses) there," said Thorne, who said the lawsuit should be filed within a 
month by the Society of Separationists, the legal arm of American Atheists. 
</P>
<P>
"Individuals have freedom of religion, government does not," said Thorne, who 
maintains that federal courts have consistently ruled against local governments 
in similar cases. "No cross has withstood this kind of action." 
</P>
<P>
Thorne said the very existence of the crosses promotes Christianity.

VISTANS BITE BACK AGAINST BUG INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As in a suburban nightmare, a Vista neighborhood has mobilized itself against 
an invasion of billions of little bugs from a nearby field that have swarmed 
over their patios, driveways, lawns and gardens and in some cases gotten into 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The bug invasion is evoking references to Alfred Hitchcock's "Birds" and a 
Stephen King horror novel. 
</P>
<P>
The insects, identified by authorities as vegetation-eating false chinch bugs, 
pose no threat to humans or animals but are causing restless nights among some 
children and concern among gardeners about what will be left of their 
vegetation in a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Ellebrecht, who lives on Sequoia Crest in southwestern Vista, near 
Shadowridge and Melrose Drives, estimated that 50 homes in his neighborhood 
have been invaded by the pests and said not much seems to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
"You can kill them with insecticide, but more keep on coming," he said. "It's 
like a river of insects. You spray and they die, but more just come. It's like 
something you'd see in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
Added Edward Nickles, who lives on nearby Applewood Lane: "There are billions 
of them, and I'm not kidding. I sprayed a retaining wall with (insecticide) and 
killed them, and 15 minutes later more were climbing over it. I swept up dead 
ones, and it looked like a shovel of dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Most neighbors are spraying the perimeters of their property with insecticide 
or washing down their driveways and patios with water. But there are some 
reports of the bugs getting into the homes of residents who are gone during the 
day and word that at least one family has retreated to a nearby motel so their 
children can sleep at night without worrying about bedbugs -- imagined or 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Source of the problem is a 55-acre, uncultivated, weedy field to the west of 
their neighborhood that is owned by the Carlsbad Municipal Water District for a 
water reservoir. Until about a year ago, the field was irrigated and planted in 
tomatoes by a farmer who leased the land, but the land has since gone to seed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ditch Was Dug 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors first started complaining about the bugs about 10 days ago, unsure of 
the source. It was eventually traced to the water district property, and as 
soon as district officials realized the problem, they disked the property, dug 
a ditch along the perimeter and have used hand-spraying and a small, hand-held 
torch to kill the bugs as they enter the ditch. Neighbors say the work seems to 
be paying off -- although countless numbers already inched their way to freedom 
before the barriers were set up. 
</P>
<P>
David Kellum, the county entomologist, said outbreaks of the false chinch bug 
are not uncommon, especially from once-fertile fields that have gone unwatered 
and uncultivated for a year or more. The bugs abandon their host in search, 
literally, of greener pastures, like some endless wagon train as wide as the 
field itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The field dried up and their food source was depleted, so they're looking for 
new food," Kellum said. In this case, their target was the Ellebrecht's and 
Nickles' neighborhood, which is about 1 1/2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"As more and more people infringe into rural neighborhoods, they'll see this," 
he said. "There have probably been outbreaks like this before, but nobody was 
around then to complain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crawl Up the Body 
</P>
<P>
The bugs are darkish brown and about an eighth of an inch long. "You wonder 
where their legs are, they're so small, and how they move so fast," Nickles 
said. "It's almost comical to watch them. But then, if they get on your shoes, 
they start crawling up on you and get on your neck and arms." 
</P>
<P>
Kellum and Keith MacBarron, the county's vector ecologist, suggest that 
residents simply abate the problem as best they can with streams of water. Many 
will simply drown.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court jury awarded $969,757 to an Ocean Beach man after finding that 
the San Diego Transit Corp. was partly responsible for injuries he suffered in 
an April, 1986, accident as he attempted to cross the street behind a city bus. 
</P>
<P>
The jury ruled Wednesday in favor of Anthony Brown, 53, even though it found 
that he, the transit company and the motorist who hit him were equally liable 
for the accident. Brown is to receive two-thirds of the $1.4-million award 
after the jury found he was one-third responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was hospitalized two months and had to have part of the temporal lobe of 
his brain removed. He suffered a severe memory loss, does not speak clearly and 
cannot organize his thoughts well, said Craig Higgs, one of Brown's attorneys.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy shot an unidentified man to death Friday after a traffic 
stop in Vista turned into a foot chase and a struggle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy William Anderson shot the man in the body about 4 a.m. after the man 
overpowered him and nearly choked him unconscious, said Sheriff's Department 
spokesman Lt. Bob Trevino. The name of the dead man was being withheld until 
his family was notified. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino said that Anderson, a four-year veteran of the department's Vista 
substation, fired the shot as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson pulled the man over about 3:50 a.m. in the 300 block of Hillside 
Terrace because he suspected he was drunk, Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
After the man stepped out of his car, he began running, and Anderson gave 
chase, Trevino said. The two ended up in a yard down the street, where the 
fight broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who was on the ground with the man straddling and choking him, 
believed he was on the verge of passing out when he pulled out his handgun and 
fired the fatal shot, Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was transferred to Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, where he was 
pronounced dead, Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies found the man to have a small amount of narcotics and drug 
paraphernalia in his possession, Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has been placed on administrative leave, and the shooting is under 
investigation by the sheriff's homicide detail.

3 MILLION OUT OF THE SHADOWS; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSY, CELEBRATION AS AMNESTY TURNS 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid much hoopla, the nation's amnesty program got off the ground two years ago 
Friday, creating the exciting possibility of legal U. S. residence for millions 
of longtime undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Two years and much controversy later, more than 3 million people have come out 
of the shadows and become legal residents under the program, among them about 
100,000 in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have said that more liberal guidelines and more diligent work by the U. 
S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which administers the program, could 
have opened the doors for many more. INS officials have said they did as much 
as they could. 
</P>
<P>
Although such disagreements continue, there is unanimous recognition that the 
program has been a boon for the people who have qualified for legal residence. 
Two groups of undocumented people were eligible: those who could show they have 
lived continuously in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982, and field hands who 
could demonstrate they performed at least 90 days of farm labor during a recent 
one-year period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Cinco de Mayo 
</P>
<P>
On the program's two-year anniversary, which coincided with Mexico's Cinco de 
Mayo, officials of the INS took time for a low-key celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Among those at the legalization office in San Diego was Marisela Plata de Rosas 
of San Diego, a 38-year-old mother of three sons -- aged 19, 16 and 11 -- whose 
entire family has become legal under the program. Plata, a native of Mexico 
City who works to support her family, said she has been living in the United 
States since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the most important thing about amnesty is that my sons can keep on 
studying," she said as she sat in the INS office, festooned for the day with 
balloons and bunting. "Before, we didn't know what would happen. We thought 
maybe we would have to go back to Mexico eventually." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Plata family was submitting its applications for the program's 
critical second phase, under which the newly legalized progress from temporary 
to permanent status -- and the cherished "green card" that allows them to live 
and work in the United States. Those who fail to file in the second phase -- 
everyone has at least 12 months to do so -- will revert to illegal status, and 
are subject to deportation. 
</P>
<P>
(The second phase, which began in November, applies to so-called "general" 
amnesty applicants filing under the Jan. 1, 1982, cutoff date; farm worker 
applicants progress almost automatically to permanent legal status.) 
</P>
<P>
INS officials and others have expressed fears that the second-phase process is 
going slowly. Basic U. S. civics and English-language requirements are expected 
to discourage some applicants, although amnesty seekers have the option of 
taking classes to meet the requirements. In some areas, notably Los Angeles, 
applicants have had trouble finding space in classes, a fact that has added to 
concern about the program's future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pace Has Quickened 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obstacles, officials said Friday that the application pace has 
quickened considerably in recent weeks. About a quarter of the almost 1 million 
general amnesty applicants in California have already submitted their 
second-phase applications, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first there was just too much confusion in the second phase," said Harold 
W. Ezell, the INS' Western regional commissioner. "Now we're picking up some 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Applications will continue pouring in until November, 1990, when the final 
filings will be accepted. By then, Marisela Plata said, she hopes she and her 
family will be permanent legal residents, and well on their way to U. S. 
citizenship, something that takes five more years but that Plata says is 
essential.

OGDEN BURNER TEST SAFELY DESTROYED WASTES, EPA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial test run of Ogden Environmental Services' experimental 
hazardous-waste incinerator successfully destroyed potentially carcinogenic 
organic compounds in petroleum-contaminated soil, according to preliminary 
results released this week by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden's incinerator successfully destroyed the compounds from Fullerton's 
McColl waste dump, exceeding the required 99.99% destruction of certain 
compounds during the four-day test that began March 27. 
</P>
<P>
"No significant levels of hazardous organic compounds left the system in the 
stack gas or remained in the bed and fly ash material," according to an EPA 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with the preliminary results," said Terry Wilson, spokesman 
for the EPA's Western regional office. "They met (requirements for) everything 
or exceeded them." 
</P>
<P>
The results, although still incomplete, are a significant step forward for the 
company, which is attempting to win a lucrative Superfund contract to 
incinerate all 265,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil at the 8-acre waste 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2-Year Battle With Environmentalists 
</P>
<P>
The company, whose plan to conduct the experiment in a populated section of La 
Jolla sparked a two-year battle with environmentalists and the San Diego City 
Council, hopes to win permission to conduct a similar test burn in a mobile 
incinerator at the McColl site later this year. If successful, that test would 
allow Ogden to compete with other companies for the McColl cleanup contract. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be determined by the EPA is whether the combustion process created 
highly carcinogenic dioxins, PCBs or furans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted with it," said Robert Wilbourn, Ogden's director of operations 
and technical support. "We feel that it proves the technology. It doesn't come 
as a surprise to us." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Porras, chairwoman of a citizens group that has been lobbying for the 
cleanup of McColl for 10 years, was equally pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives the community a lot of hope that McColl can be cleaned up, " said 
Porras, chairwoman of the McColl Community Action Group. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Takvorian, executive director of the Environmental Health Coalition, 
which opposed the test burn, said Friday that she could not comment on the 
results because she had not seen the report. The county's Air Pollution Control 
District also had no information on the analysis, and was not ready to release 
the results of its own air-quality tests. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden and the city this week settled their 17-month legal battle over the test 
burn when the city agreed to drop its appeal of a U. S. District Court judge's 
order allowing the March test burn. The city also agreed to pay Ogden $1.25 
million in attorneys' fees and damages for delaying the test burn. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is conditional on a federal court magistrate verifying that the 
emissions were not harmful to the public. 
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA "fact sheet," mailed this week to Ogden, Porras and 
others, the experimental hazardous-waste incinerator successfully destroyed a 
chemical tracer added to the 7,500 pounds of McColl waste and clean soil burned 
during the 31-hour test of the incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Required Efficiency Was Exceeded 
</P>
<P>
The incinerator, which reached temperatures as high as 1,700 degrees 
Fahrenheit, achieved a "destruction and removal efficiency" of 99.992%, 
exceeding the required 99.99% for the compound "carbon tetrachloride" inserted 
into the waste stream by evaluators. Wilbourn claimed that the incinerator 
could have destroyed even more of the chemical if technicians had not adjusted 
its operation to test other variables. 
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the incinerator dramatically reduced the quantities of 
benzene, toluene, naphthalene and four other compounds in stack gas emissions. 
In ash trapped in the incinerator's bed and "baghouse" filter, the compounds 
were reduced to the point that they were undetectable. 
</P>
<P>
By adding limestone to the waste mix as it was burned, the process more than 
neutralized the highly acidic waste, making it possible to bury the ash left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbourn said the incinerator also succeeded in limiting emissions of nitrogen 
oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and hydrochloric acid. 
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that the incinerator process "was able to minimize" sulfur 
oxide emissions, but it also noted that the sulfur dioxide analyzer was not 
operating well enough to detect those emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbourn said a private contractor's analysis of those emissions showed that 
the incinerator was successful, but said that the EPA will not accept those 
results. 
</P>
<P>
A second EPA report is due in June and a final evaluation in August.

BUSINESS BOOST TO EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Business Roundtable members who are concerned with reforming public 
education think school systems will be more likely to change if they help plan 
the changes. Last year the group's task force on education made general 
suggestions for change, calling, for example, for vastly expanded preschool 
programs and more involvement of teachers and parents in education planning. 
Now, the same business people are backing legislation in Sacramento to get 
school systems directly involved in planning how the suggested reforms should 
be carried out. It's a logical approach and deserves support. 
</P>
<P>
The business leaders have altruistic and practical motives. They want 
California's youngsters to have brighter futures. They also want workers for 
the 21st Century who know how to read, write, calculate -- and think in an 
organized fashion. Many job applicants today lack those skills. Pacific Bell 
reports that more than half the 6,000 applicants tested for entry-level 
operator and clerical jobs in one recent 12-month period were not able to pass 
basic tests. 
</P>
<P>
To try to help California students, the business report recommended tightening 
standards for teacher preparation and advancement while also giving good 
teachers more of a role in decision-making at each school. But unless school 
districts have a stake in making these changes happen, those recommendations 
could gather dust as so many other reports do, said Joseph F. Alibrandi, head 
of Whittaker Corp. and chairman of the group's education task force. 
</P>
<P>
SB 1274, introduced by Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who chairs the Senate 
Education Committee, is the vehicle for this effort. It establishes 
demonstration programs under which the state would pay selected local districts 
to design their own reform programs. School districts wouldn't have to include 
every element in the task force's report in their own plans, but they would 
definitely have to focus on ways to get more parents involved and to improve 
teacher preparation. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet how much money may be available to start such reform 
efforts. One proposal calls for $6 million in planning grants during the first 
year. The legislative leaders think $40 million a year for four years 
thereafter would be a realistic amount to implement the program. Among their 
goals are providing more help for beginning teachers, training teachers to work 
more effectively with potential dropouts and developing ways to lighten 
teachers' workloads. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature will be considering a variety of reform measures this year. 
This one has special merit because the people who write the reforms will be the 
ones who later must put them into effect, creating a built-in support system.

THE RISKS OF UNDERREGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exxon is the nation's third largest industrial corporation, earning $5.3 
billion in profit on sales of nearly $80 billion last year. Despite these 
resources, however, this immense corporate empire has failed to come to grips 
with its oil spill more than five weeks after the Exxon Valdez ran aground on 
Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon's first cleanup plan was found to be inadequate by federal officials. Its 
second plan seems to retreat even from the commitment of the first plan, 
proposing 3,400 workers compared with 4,000, and calculating 364 miles of 
contaminated beach when Alaska officials count double that amount. Coast Guard 
Commandant Paul A. Yost characterized the new plan as "quite light, very thin." 
Federal approval is pending. Alaskan environmental officials called it 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan, in fact, would abandon the cleanup of 191 miles of "moderately 
soiled" beach to natural wave action. This course seems to follow silent 
approval of some but not all top federal officials. After a visit to Alaska in 
late April, Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. said that washing the 
beaches with hoses was not going to do the job. He derided the effort as 
make-work for appearance's sake. "What I think will happen is, nature, with the 
tide coming in and going out, is what's going to take care of it." That may 
prove to be the only alternative in some areas, but any beach that can be 
cleaned this summer will reduce the long-term fouling. The cleaner the beaches 
now, the less wildlife will be threatened with oil damage and spill-caused 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the scene Thursday, Vice President Dan Quayle said that Exxon 
must do more, perhaps a signal of a more vigorous response from Washington. 
"And the President is not going to let anyone off the hook," he added. "The job 
will be done." Quayle sought to defend President Bush against criticism that he 
had not responded vigorously enough to the March 24 disaster. Quayle told 
Alaskans that one of the reasons for his trip was that "I'm here as his vice 
president, because he feels strongly about this." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Exxon seemed to treat the disaster as just one of those things. Yes, 
the oil spill was a bad one, the firm said in a recent statement, "but 
accidents can happen to anyone." The arrogance of the company seems to be 
exceeded only by its insensitivity to the dimensions of the disaster and the 
concern of people throughout the country for the Alaskan environment and 
wildlife. Yes, accidents can happen anywhere, but there are ways to guard the 
wildest, most magnificent landscapes in the world. It was the oil industry 
itself that assured Congress and the American people that the oil 
transportation link to Alaska was virtually foolproof. And it was the industry 
that guaranteed that even if there were an accident, the oil consortium that 
runs the Valdez marine terminal had equipment and manpower on hand to deal 
promptly with any spill. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon keeps emphasizing that it will pay for the cleanup. But any cost not 
covered by insurance will be tax-deductible, the firm has noted. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez spill has demonstrated that Americans cannot rely on the good 
will of corporations to clean up their own messes adequately, although there 
are companies that value their public image so highly they will do the right 
thing. The Alaskan tragedy makes the case for strong federal regulations and 
controls closely monitored and strongly enforced. There must be stiff penalties 
for failure to comply. And whenever a company assumes a less-than-urgent 
approach to such a cleanup, the government must not hesitate to take direct 
command of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
For the past eight years, the national Administration has complained about the 
cost of government regulation of business and worked to reduce the number of 
rules. Now, the nation knows the cost of insufficient regulation.

MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial is little more than a mean-spirited tirade directed against 
animal rights activists. Referring to these activists as cranks, and as being 
self-absorbed and vulgar, and as people engaged in self-righteous tantrums is 
uncalled for. 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue in the View Section there is an article about Jane Goodall, a 
scientist of unquestionable reputation, whose attitude concerning medical 
research on animals is much more reasonable than that presented on the 
Editorial Page. She advocates that more money and research be invested in 
funding alternative research methods and that there be more effective 
supervision to see that the animals in medical laboratories receive the best 
possible treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Surely there must be ways of discovering medical knowledge other than 
continually torturing so many helpless animals. If there is such a thing as a 
just God, the human species will be punished for its cruel treatment of other 
animals.

That was quite an editorial ("Misplaced Sentimentality," April 27). I don't 
think I've ever seen the animal rights movement -- excuse me, the "so-called" 
animal rights movement -- so easily dismissed. Since you obviously can't 
address the real issue -- that animals are not ours to use, period -- you 
resort to name calling: eccentric, cranks, self-righteous, zealots, silly, 
self-absorbed, vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that those who defend using helpless animals any way they please 
are the ones who are self-absorbed. The fact that you came out against animal 
rights was no surprise, since you virtually ignore the movement and run 
pro-research articles. But such a shrill, mean-spirited editorial does all your 
readers a disservice, regardless of where they stand on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was the most self-righteous, silly, and vulgar thing I have ever 
seen written on the subject.

GOLD MINING AND WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What fool would pose such a question: "Should we allow a foreign interest to 
extract gold from the American soil of a proposed national park and leave us a 
seething, cyanide-laced toxic pit?" At best, the popularity of such a proposal 
is laughable. Unfortunately, the humor is lost both on the Bureau of Land 
Management as well as to our archaic and permissive General Mining Law of 1872. 
</P>
<P>
The responses which predictably range from shock to incredulous disbelief tell 
us that Californians are not humored. The BLM hearing, which should have asked 
the question "whether," merely asked "how." But despite this breakdown of the 
representative process, thanks to the efforts of Levine and the environmental 
consciousness basic to almost all Americans, both the bureau and the Viceroy 
Resources Corp. will receive their unsolicited reply.

I would like to ask the protesters against using animals for medical research 
two questions: 
</P>
<P>
1. Do they think it is more humane to use human beings for that purpose? 
</P>
<P>
2. How many of the protesters are vegetarians? I do not think there are many. 
</P>
<P>
Do they know that meat eaters are killing animals by the thousands every day? 
Therefore, such protests are not only ridiculous, but also hypocritical.

I wish to applaud you for your article "22 Are Arrested in Protest of Animal 
Research at UCLA," by John Lee and Larry Gordon (Metro, April 25). 
</P>
<P>
I fully endorse the demonstration done by the group Last Chance for Animals. It 
is heartbreaking to learn how these precious little animals who, having the 
misfortune of not only being unwanted, abandoned and/or lost, have wound up 
being subjected to the most extreme torture and cruelty by mankind, all in the 
name of "medical science."

REMEMBERING LUCILLE BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reflecting on the life and death of Lucille Ball, I realized I had always 
thought of her not as an inaccessible icon of stardom so much as a lifelong 
friend. Whenever I needed to get away from my own troubles, whenever I needed 
to look at the lighter side of things, whenever I needed a good laugh, Lucy was 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more important than that millions of us loved her was the fact 
that we genuinely liked Lucy. And our children and grandchildren are sure to 
like this great comic talent every bit as much as we do. 
</P>
<P>
May she now find the eternal happiness that her genius gave us all for all 
time.

REMEMBERING LUCILLE BALL

<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to the loss of the "national treasure" by the name of Lucille Ball: 
</P>
<P>
When my friend Sally was close to dying in the hospital from a rare form of 
spinal cancer the one thing she wanted to do was watch "I Love Lucy." To her 
disappointment, the hospital TV system could not get the station that aired the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
So every day, a few minutes before noon, I would call her, long distance, put 
the telephone receiver up to the TV set and do play-by-play Lucy: "Lucy's 
stomping the grapes . . . she lost her ring in the BBQ pit . . . she's 
imitating Harpo Marx . . . Lucy brought a puppy home for little Ricky . . . 
she's stuffing the chocolates in her mouth as fast as she can and the conveyor 
belt just sped up. . . ." I could hear Sally squeal with delight. 
</P>
<P>
Sally was one of the 39 people with this form of cancer who survived. Maybe her 
recovery was blessed by the magic of Lucy.

MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial on the need for and benefits of the use of animals in biomedical 
research perfectly articulated for me the intellectual and spiritual 
characteristics of so-called animal rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
As a writer who deals with health and medical subjects, I am profoundly 
offended by the antisocial and anti-humanitarian tricks of the activists. Three 
memorable Times phrases will help me to put their behavior in perspective. That 
behavior is "self-righteous tantrums masquerading as appeals to conscience," 
informed by "minds so self-absorbed and vulgar that they are unable to equate 
the suffering of mice with that of dying children," and based on "a misplaced 
sentimentality pretending to be compassion." 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for this gem of clear thinking and vivid exposition.

INSURANCE FOCUS SHIFTS TO GILLESPIE; 
</P>
<P>
BIAS FOR INDUSTRY ALLEGED; SHE MUST QUIT, NADER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just 24 hours after the state Supreme Court upheld most of Proposition 103, 
state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie was already caught in a cross 
fire Friday between consumer activists and the insurance industry as insurer 
requests for exemptions from the measure's rate rollbacks began flowing into 
her office. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, charging that Gillespie is biased in the 
industry's favor, demanded that she step down and urged Gov. George Deukmejian 
to appoint "someone with an impeccable background of impartiality and 
competence." 
</P>
<P>
"Commissioner Gillespie should tender her resignation and step aside, because 
she has irreversibly prejudiced herself against any fair implementation of the 
refund provisions," said Nader, Proposition 103's best-known supporter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Outright Hostility' 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Gillespie had sought to discredit the initiative before voters 
passed it in November and has displayed "skepticism, if not outright hostility, 
toward her obligations to implement those provisions which were not stayed by 
the . . . Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie spokeswoman Carey Fletcher said Gillespie will not resign. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not going to resign. She has no reason to resign. . . . She is the 
consumer commissioner," said Fletcher, who related that Gillespie once said, " 
'Being criticized by Mr. Nader is a little like being criticized by Mother 
Teresa. What are you going to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt, the organization that sponsored 
Proposition 103, said Friday that in his view Gillespie "will not dare" exempt 
too many companies from the rollbacks provided in his initiative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduction Mandated 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 says that unless they are granted exemptions by the state 
insurance commissioner, insurers must roll rates back 20% from what they were 
charging for the same coverage in November, 1987 -- a year before the 
initiative was approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Under Thursday's court ruling, insurers who apply for exemptions can charge 
higher rates, but if the commissioner eventually orders them to implement 
rollbacks, they will have to refund, with interest, any premiums they have 
collected above the allowable levels. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield predicted that Gillespie ultimately will order insurers who have 
charged higher rates to make sizable refunds. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to fight this tooth and nail for about an hour and a half, and 
then there will be a firestorm," Rosenfield predicted. "There's going to be so 
much pressure on her to come through for the people and give the rollbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Gillespie was in Greece Thursday when the high court rendered its 
decision, Rosenfield remarked, "She ought not to come back from Greece if she's 
going to take the approach that all of these companies have a right to charge 
the rates they're charging." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield's statements drew a quick rejoinder from industry lawyer Allen M. 
Katz, who pointed out that the Supreme Court in its decision had instructed 
Gillespie that the insurance companies should earn a "fair and reasonable" 
return on their business. 
</P>
<P>
Even if insurers decide not to appeal the court's decision to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, Katz said, they will certainly appeal to the courts any Gillespie 
decision not to exempt companies from the rollbacks, if those companies can 
reasonably justify their rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Our right of appeal from these administrative decisions is explicitly pointed 
out in the court's opinion," Katz declared. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for several companies reiterated Friday that they feel confident that 
their present rates will be upheld in hearings that Gillespie is expected to 
order soon after returning to her office on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurers' Comments 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Byers of the Farmers group of companies declared: "Certainly we feel 
fairly positive about the opportunity to present documentation on our rates and 
that they will meet the standards of fair and reasonable return which were 
confirmed by the court. Our rates have always been fair, and we welcome the 
opportunity to provide information to support them." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Hogan of Allstate said, "We feel the rates we're going to file are 
fair and reasonable, and we think the insurance commissioner will also find 
them fair and reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Morris of the Automobile Club of Southern California said, "We feel very 
confident that the rates we're currently charging, which have been in effect 
since January, 1988, are not excessive." 
</P>
<P>
Morris pointed out that last year Gillespie began requiring that companies 
increasing their annual premiums by 10% or more file advance notice with her so 
she could challenge the increases if she felt they were unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
"We filed and were not challenged," Morris said. "So in effect the (Insurance) 
department has already given approval to the rates that were filed and are 
currently in use." 
</P>
<P>
But an Insurance Department spokeswoman said Friday that the Supreme Court 
decision sets new procedures for establishing rates, and any company seeking an 
exemption will have to be evaluated anew. 
</P>
<P>
Despite insurers' confidence that they will prevail, some political observers 
said Friday that insurance has become such a politically charged issue in 
California that both Gillespie and Deukmejian, who appointed her, are unlikely 
to favor the companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel she will bend toward the consumer view on the rollbacks," said state 
Sen. Alan Robbins, chairman of the Senate's Insurance Committee, "and I think 
the guidance she's going to get from the governor will also lean in that 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
But Nader painted a much darker picture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Issue for '90 Election 
</P>
<P>
"She comes from the insurance industry to her post, and she's likely to return 
to it. The people should know she's likely to return to it," Nader said, 
predicting that if the Republican governor allows Gillespie to remain in office 
he would be handing Democrats a potent issue in the next gubernatorial 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"If Commissioner Gillespie performs like an executive of Aetna, the refunds 
will not be forthcoming and the issue will become a dominant factor in the 1990 
gubernatorial election," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others predicted that political considerations would give way to legal and 
administrative factors, pointing out that, under the law, Gillespie will have 
to establish intricate procedures and conduct extensive hearings before she can 
do anything about the rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Politics right now is the least relevant issue," said Steven Miller, head of 
the Insurance Consumer Action Network. "It's an administrative task. There are 
a host of regulatory decisions to make. 
</P>
<P>
"Gillespie must articulate those standards by which she will review the rates 
the companies are charging. She must define what data she'll require and most 
importantly what will be, in her mind, the standard by which to judge a fair 
rate of return. She has to do all that before she can judge the applications 
for exemptions." 
</P>
<P>
Miller expressed the view that some rollbacks and rebate checks will be ordered 
by Gillespie, particularly in the areas of homeowners and renters insurance. He 
said that any lengthy delays by the insurance commissioner in ordering these 
would only "further disadvantage consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Snyder, West Coast director of Consumers Union, said the method of 
Gillespie's deliberation must be fair and meticulous. 
</P>
<P>
"I think these are not the days of Robespierre," said Snyder in a reference to 
the French revolutionary who liberally used the guillotine against political 
opponents. "The due process supported by the court means the insurance 
companies and the consumers get due process." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Action Taken 
</P>
<P>
Snyder noted, as did Miller, that Gillespie had balked, while the Supreme Court 
was considering the insurers' lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of 
Proposition 103, at writing any administrative regulations looking forward to 
enforcing provisions of the measure, particularly the key ones on rate 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been asking the commissioner for a long period for action on this," he 
said. "She refused. . . . Now she must act quickly to establish the 
procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie was reported en route home Friday and was not available for comment. 
But Fletcher, her spokeswoman, said she expects some announcement on rate 
hearing standards and procedures as early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our legal department has been working on these," Fletcher said. "They will be 
ready on the commissioner's return." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she said, the Insurance Department does not expect a flood of 
exemption filings for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"Any kind of filing requesting an exemption would have to provide extensive 
information," Fletcher said. "They wouldn't be waltzing through the door this 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
However, Fletcher said late in the day that 10 companies had filed letters 
seeking exemptions and "the department is reviewing them to see if they qualify 
as valid applications for rate relief." 
</P>
<P>
The companies included four big insurers -- Allstate, 20th Century, Mercury and 
Prudential. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear Friday that extensive administrative hearings, for perhaps 
thousands of separate rate filings, will eventually have to be held. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been discussing here at State Farm who won in the Supreme Court 
decision," said Kim Brunner, an attorney at that insurer's Illinois 
headquarters Friday. "I guess the way I read the decision is that the 
government bureaucracy wins."

JUDGE ORDERS FBI PROMOTION SYSTEM REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a decision hailed by Latino agents as the death knell of "the good old boy 
system" in the FBI, a federal judge on Friday ordered the creation of a special 
outside panel to consider claims of individual agents passed over for 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
But FBI officials also praised the judge's opinion, noting that it was laced 
with compliments on the bureau's recent efforts to improve minority job 
opportunities and that it avoided any monetary award to 300 Latino agents who 
successfully sued the bureau last year. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion by U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton in El Paso was anxiously 
awaited by both sides since he ruled last September that the Latino agents were 
victims of racial discrimination in career advancement opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Changes 
</P>
<P>
In the 55-page opinion Friday, Bunton outlined a series of minor organization 
reforms intended to prevent future discrimination in the promotion of Latinos 
and other minorities. But he ruled out back pay or automatic promotions for all 
those involved in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action case had its origins in a bitter dispute that began in 1982 
between the two top officials of the FBI's Los Angeles office, Richard T. 
Bretzing and his top assistant, Bernardo (Matt) Perez, who was subsequently 
transferred to the smaller FBI office in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
While Bunton agreed last September that Perez had been unfairly punished by the 
FBI for initiating the lawsuit, the judge stopped short Friday of granting 
Perez the remedies he has sought in either monetary compensation or career 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
Bunton ordered the FBI to promote Perez from his present position as assistant 
agent-in-charge of the El Paso office to a higher post as agent-in-charge of 
some other office or some comparable job within the next 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said Friday he was "very pleased" that Bunton had ordered changes in the 
process of promoting minority agents, but he expressed disappointment that the 
judge did not award monetary damages or rule that he should get an even higher 
position within the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"That does not thrill me," he said. "I'm $80,000 in debt because of this suit. 
I think I should be made at least an assistant director or an executive 
assistant director. I was a special agent-in-charge 10 years ago (in San Juan, 
P. R.). To get that position again is not a promotion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sessions Issues Statement 
</P>
<P>
While Perez expressed some unhappiness over Bunton's ruling, the FBI's initial 
reaction was one of cautious conciliation with the court. Although reserving 
the right to appeal the ruling, FBI Director William S. Sessions issued a 
moderately worded statement: 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking with care at Judge Bunton's ruling with an eye toward building 
further on the many improvements already undertaken in the FBI's personnel 
practices. I am pleased that the court took cognizance of changes I have made 
in the FBI's career development, language services and equal employment 
opportunities programs." 
</P>
<P>
Sessions added: "Of course we are carefully considering the specific changes in 
FBI programs and policies mandated by the court to assess their impact on the 
overall operations of the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to setting up a three-member panel of non-FBI officials to hear 
complaints by FBI agents involved in the lawsuit, Bunton ruled that the head of 
any of the bureau's 58 field offices should not be allowed to overrule or 
ignore recommendations for promotion made by local career boards composed of 
other top local FBI officials. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials, expressing some puzzlement at the order, said current agency 
rules already preclude local FBI chiefs from such interference, although they 
conceded there may have been abuses in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence G. Lawler, agent-in-charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said the 
common practice in Los Angeles is that a career board composed of FBI 
supervisors recommends a candidate for any new supervisory position. While he 
is free to recommend someone else, Lawler said he rarely does so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reviewed in Washington 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation from Los Angeles is then sent to an FBI career board in 
Washington that also considers qualified candidates from other offices and 
makes the final decision, Lawler said. 
</P>
<P>
"In looking over this opinion, that's already the way I run this office," 
Lawler said. "I see nothing in this thing that's not currently in place in the 
FBI's office here." 
</P>
<P>
While Lawler had no other comment, other FBI officials said they were happy 
there was no monetary award to the bureau's Latino agents, contending that any 
such award would have been harmful to overall morale. There was general 
approval of the grievance panel as the best possible tool in resolving 
continuing personnel disputes of those involved in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Just as there was a tone of conciliation from FBI officials, some of the agents 
involved in the lawsuit also went out of their way to praise the bureau for 
instituting reforms in advance of Bunton's decision. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Los Angeles, FBI agent Paul Magallanes proclaimed the 
ruling to be a victory for Latino agents and said it was appropriate that the 
judge issued it on Cinco de Mayo, a Mexican holiday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Wide Impact 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Bunton is calling for sweeping institutional changes in the FBI," 
Magallanes said. "I must emphasize that we are not the only ones who won. The 
FBI won. And future generations who enter the bureau won. 
</P>
<P>
"To its credit, the bureau did not wait for a ruling before making these 
changes," Magallanes added. "It has already begun taking steps in the right 
direction with several programs." 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Bunton noted that the FBI had already begun to establish its own 
grievance procedure to handle promotion disputes and separate reforms to 
monitor incidents of discrimination. He also observed that the bureau has 
already decided to add minority representatives to career boards. 
</P>
<P>
Bunton described the reforms as "well-intentioned," but he said that he needed 
to add more "dramatic" repairs to make the FBI's future minority promotion 
practices acceptable under federal law.

CITY ATTY. HAS NO RECORD OF BRADLEY ASKING ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office, searching its files for documents 
related to the ongoing investigation of Mayor Tom Bradley's personal finances, 
said Friday that it has found no indication that the mayor ever consulted with 
its lawyers on the propriety of his connections to local lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The determination, disclosed by office spokesman Mike Qualls after a formal 
request by The Times, followed an assertion several months ago by Bradley that 
he had voluntarily sought the advice of the city attorney before joining the 
board of directors of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Defending himself in an interview with The Times, Bradley said he had been 
concerned about a conflict of interest in joining the board but was told the 
move was acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"The first question I asked was about a conflict," Bradley said in the 
interview. "No, not only did I ask the members of the company who came to me 
and invited me to serve (Valley Federal); I also checked with the city attorney 
to be certain that there were no legal problems that he could anticipate. He 
could see none. I could see none." 
</P>
<P>
But Burt Pines, then the city attorney and now in private practice in Los 
Angeles, recalled no such conversation. "I didn't have the discussion," Pines 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, however, Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler, relaying new information 
from the mayor, said that Bradley had asked the advice of Deputy City Atty. 
James Doherty, who regularly handled conflict-of-interest inquiries in 1978. 
The mayor said that the advice was rendered orally and that Doherty implied 
there was no need for a written report. 
</P>
<P>
Doherty has since died, but his records were among those checked by staff 
attorneys in a thorough search of formal opinions and the files of memos and 
letters by individual attorneys, city attorney spokesman Qualls said. Neither 
correspondence on the Valley Federal matter, now under investigation, nor 
records of concern by Bradley on any potential conflict were found. 
</P>
<P>
Qualls did not rule out the possibility that the verbal approval was tendered, 
but said that none of the staff attorneys questioned in the probe could recall 
such a request. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's spokesman added that the mayor specifically recalled asking whether 
the City Charter allowed him to join the institution's board. There is no 
indication that he discussed whether he could act on their behalf after joining 
the board. Allegations that the mayor interceded on behalf of the institution 
are at the heart of the controversy surrounding him. 
</P>
<P>
The breadth of the probes concerning Bradley, meanwhile, continued to spread. 
The Fair Political Practices Commission, the state's political watchdog unit, 
has now opened its own review of possible conflict of interest violations by 
Bradley, who only last month narrowly averted a runoff election en route to a 
record fifth mayoral term. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC review -- which was described by spokeswoman Jeanette Turvill as 
preliminary -- essentially mimics a probe already under way in the city 
attorney's office, which is delving into Bradley's activities as a paid adviser 
or board member of two financial institutions that did business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We have under review the most recent allegations regarding his position (with) 
financial institutions," said Turvill, who added that no decision has been 
reached about whether a full investigation is required. 
</P>
<P>
If Bradley is found to have violated state laws -- which prohibit attempting to 
influence decisions on matters in which he has a financial interest, fines of 
up to $2,000 per violation could be levied, Turvill said. The penalties would 
be separate from any civil fines sought by the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC probe follows closely upon another the state agency launched against 
the mayor. Already under investigation is Bradley's participation in 1986 votes 
when he sat as chairman of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission -- 
that gave commission consulting business to some of his large political 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
After inquiries by The Times late last year, the mayor quickly returned $17,000 
in contributions from those involved in the votes. Records showed that the 
mayor's office had been warned about the possible conflicts of interest in the 
matter, but Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said there had been a breakdown in 
communication within the mayor's staff. 
</P>
<P>
The swirl of controversy surrounding the 71-year-old Bradley strikes at the 
heart of his political image of personal integrity, an image that he has 
cultivated from his days as a Los Angeles police officer, through terms on the 
City Council and during his mayoral tenure. 
</P>
<P>
The probe initially centered on Bradley's paid positions with two local 
institutions, Valley Federal and Far East National Bank. The bank gave Bradley 
$18,000 last year for serving as the only paid member of its advisory board. 
Bradley said the money was tendered for his advice on international trade, 
while the bank's president, Henry Hwang, said the money was for "services 
rendered in the future." Bradley returned the money in March. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley joined the board of Valley Federal in 1978 at an annual salary of up to 
$24,000. He resigned as a director emeritus one day after the mayoral primary 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said initially that he did not know that the institutions were doing 
business with the city, but his account has been contradicted in recent weeks 
in documents made available to The Times. Indeed, the documents suggested that 
telephone calls made by Bradley spurred the city treasurer's office to work 
more closely with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
After vowing to cooperate with investigations and saying that he has done 
nothing wrong, Bradley has refused to comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
And meanwhile, the investigations have broadened. The city attorney's office 
has forwarded to the Securities and Exchange Commission Bradley's personal 
financial statements, which show holdings in stocks and bonds involved in a 
federal investigation of the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. Despite 
forwarding the materials, City Atty. James K. Hahn has not publicly suggested 
that Bradley was personally involved in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
In a coincidental development, the city's biennial Official Salaries Authority 
will consider a study recommending that the mayor receive a hefty salary 
increase but be required by an amendment to the City Charter to give up all 
outside consulting work and directorships. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nash, a prominent compensation consultant who authored the study, said 
the position of mayor -- as well as those of City Council members, city 
attorney and city controller -- are demanding enough that the officials should 
"be expected to devote their full energies to their official capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Nash's suggestion that the mayor's salary be raised from $97,654 per year to 
$129,012, which would place him in line with the mayor of New York, was based 
on comparisons of salaries of city officials elsewhere and of pay levels of 
executives in private sector positions. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant said he arrived at the conclusions before the recent scrutiny 
over Bradley's board memberships, and he termed the timing "probably an 
unfortunate coincidence." Bradley had no comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the city attorney's office who searched unsuccessfully for a 
record of a Bradley conflict of interest inquiry said city officials routinely 
ask the office for advice on such concerns. The inquiries are voluntary and 
most are dealt with in memo form rather than in formal city attorney position 
papers, officials said.

IRANIAN URGES PALESTINIANS TO KILL AMERICANS

<P>
Hashemi Rafsanjani, Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Friday called on 
Palestinians to kill Americans and other Westerners to avenge their dead in the 
17-month uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The call provoked an immediate reaction from Washington, where the 
Administration issued a worldwide alert to American diplomatic and military 
installations, warning of a possible renewal of terrorist attacks on U.S. 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
In an inflammatory declaration, Rafsanjani said that "the people of Palestine . 
. . must avenge the blood (of the reported 461 Palestinian deaths in the 
occupied territories)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
British and French, Also 
</P>
<P>
"If in retaliation for every Palestinian martyred in Palestine they kill and 
execute, not inside Palestine, five Americans or Britons or Frenchmen, (the 
Israelis) would not continue these wrongs." 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's remarks were quoted by the official Iranian news agency in a 
report monitored in Nicosia. The news agency said that the Speaker, a strong 
candidate for the presidency in elections scheduled for August, delivered his 
"strong advice" in Friday prayers in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater issued the 
strongest Administration comment on Iran since President Bush took office. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it appalling and strongly condemn, in no uncertain terms, Rafsanjani's 
call for Palestinians to murder our citizens, citizens of allied countries and 
other innocent people," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an exhortation for Palestinians to commit terrorism and only serves to 
confirm that terrorism remains an integral feature of Ayatollah (Ruhollah) 
Khomeini's regime. The outrageous call to murder and terrorism by Iran's 
Speaker of the Parliament marks another step backwards for Iran away from the 
community of civilized nations. We hold the Iranian leadership responsible for 
any attacks on American interests or citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see here is the same kind of incredible and outrageous comments that 
we saw in the (novelist) Salman Rushdie affair," Fitzwater added. "Both are 
totally beyond the bounds of human understanding." 
</P>
<P>
One counterterrorism official in Washington described the Iranian's remarks as 
"outrageous," adding: "That's the kind of language, particularly out of 
Rafsanjani, that could lead to some disastrous consequences. This guy could get 
a lot of people killed." 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's demand for vengeance came on a day of massive rallies in the 
Iranian capital, marking Jerusalem Day, a holiday dedicated to the Palestinian 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who give $10 billion a year to preserve Israel and know what they are 
doing, is their blood worth anything?" Rafsanjani asked his audience. "It is 
not hard to kill Americans and Frenchmen. It is a bit difficult (to kill) 
Israelis, but there are so many (Americans and Frenchmen) everywhere in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urges Terrorism 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that the Iranian official also "called on Palestinians to 
hijack planes to swap prisoners in Israeli hands and to blow up factories in 
Western countries." 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, a Muslim cleric as well as a politician and commander of the 
Iranian army, was not concerned, the monitored report said, about "Western 
accusations of encouraging violence, and neither should be the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, the Bush Administration had generally taken a comparatively 
moderate line on Iran, beginning with the President's reference to better 
relations with Tehran in his inaugural address. Moreover, there has been a 
four-month hiatus in suspected Mideast terrorism attacks on American targets 
since the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration now warns of a possible renewal of violence, with 
concern centered mainly on American interests in the Middle East and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's remarks conformed to a pattern emerging in the tempestuous 
politics of Iran. Anti-Western rhetoric began there in February, when Khomeini, 
the Muslim country's supreme leader, demanded the execution of author Rushdie, 
whose novel "The Satanic Verses" he condemned as blasphemous. Britain, where 
Rushdie lives, broke relations with Tehran, and 13 other countries, mainly 
European, withdrew their ambassadors at least temporarily from the Iranian 
capital. The United States has no diplomatic relations with Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's remarks were interpreted in part as a signal to Iranian officials to 
take an anti-Western stance. Several top leaders in Tehran, including 
Rafsanjani, had supported stronger trade and diplomatic contacts with the West 
in the wake of Iran's agreement to a cease-fire last August in its long and 
bitter war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The 88-year-old ayatollah subsequently declared that his earlier personal 
choice as successor, the Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, was unfit for 
leadership. Like Rafsanjani, Montazeri had supported stronger ties with the 
West to rebuild Iran's war-shattered economy. He had also criticized the brutal 
justice meted out by Khomeini's regime. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were both alarmed and perplexed Friday by Rafsanjani's comments 
because he is widely considered to be one of the most pragmatic Iranian 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strange thing to do right now," one State Department official said. 
"We frankly are not sure what to make of it. . . . It is particularly worrisome 
from Rafsanjani. . . . You have to ask why he is doing it. It may be wrapped up 
in the (Iranian) presidential election. . . . He's very adept at reading the 
political tea leaves. He will go in whatever political direction he feels is 
necessary to strengthen his position. . . . But it is really disturbing that he 
would do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
An intelligence official in Washington said: "It is Jerusalem Day (in Iran) and 
rhetoric is always high on those occasions. But coming from Rafsanjani, this 
may be more than just rhetoric. He may be trying to cover himself by getting 
out in front of the parade on this issue. And it does come in context of the 
general anti-Western atmosphere after the Rushdie affair." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Rafsanjani has been taking a harder line in his comments on 
the West, and his political star has apparently risen again. Two weeks ago, he 
used the occasion of Friday prayers in Tehran to announce the arrest of a 
number of top-ranking military officers in what he called a "big American spy 
ring" operating in Iran. In Washington, presidential press secretary Fitzwater 
denied any knowledge of such a ring and suggested that Rafsanjani's accusations 
were politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Iran Television began a series called "Top Secret," in which 
some of the accused spies are expected to make on-the-air confessions of their 
alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Robin Wright and James Gerstenzang, in Washington, 
contributed to this story.

POPE TELLS MUSLIMS, CATHOLICS TO AVOID BATTLING FOR CONVERTS

<P>
Pope John Paul II, reflecting the church's concern about the spread of Islamic 
fundamentalism in Africa, urged Roman Catholics and Muslims on Friday to avoid 
aggressive tactics in the battle for converts. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Malawi's Catholic bishops on the last full day of his nine-day 
African tour, the Pope raised the issue of the church's tense relations with 
Muslims in this southern African nation. 
</P>
<P>
"What is required is mutual respect, as well as mutual recognition of those 
things that we share in common," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both among Christians working for unity in obedience to Christ and among 
believers of different religions, there is no place for aggressive proselytism 
which disturbs and hurts, still less for the use of unworthy methods," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refers to 1985 Speech 
</P>
<P>
The Pope quoted from his speech to Muslims in Morocco in 1985: 
</P>
<P>
"Christians and Muslims . . . have badly understood each other, and sometimes, 
in the past, have opposed and even exhausted each in polemics and in wars. I 
believe that today God invites us to change our old practices." 
</P>
<P>
There are 2.5 million Catholics and 1 million Muslims in this country of 8 
million people. The rest of the population is made up mostly of Protestants and 
animists. 
</P>
<P>
Islam has been growing rapidly in Malawi since the early 1970s. Financed in 
part by Arab oil money, Muslims have built hundreds of mosques across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions grew after Muslim extremists set fire to several Catholic churches in 
Malawi in 1983-84. Last August, several Catholic youths and an elderly religion 
teacher were forcibly circumcised in a suburb of Blantyre by Muslim 
fundamentalists, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Muslim leaders here have said they are upset that the Pope's visit to 
Malawi came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope also celebrated a morning Mass for more than 100,000 people at 
Blantyre's Kwacha (Freedom) Park, addressed at least 60,000 youths at the 
Kamuzu sports stadium and met with the Catholic laity and representatives of 
other Christian faiths and other religions. 
</P>
<P>
In his homily, he urged his flock to treat victims of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome as "we would treat Christ himself." 
</P>
<P>
Malawi has one of the highest rates of AIDS in Africa. According to local 
health officials, as many as 20% of newborn children are infected with the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope travels today to Lilongwe, Malawi's administrative capital, to 
celebrate the final Mass of his voyage before returning to Rome.

LONDON EXPELS 3 S. AFRICANS OVER WEAPONS DEAL

Britain ordered the expulsion of three South African diplomats Friday over 
their country's alleged role in a deal with Northern Ireland extremists to swap 
guns for British missile technology. 
</P>
<P>
Although the South African government denied involvement, the Foreign Office 
appeared to implicate Pretoria when it spoke of "the grave concern with which 
Her Majesty's government viewed the involvement by South African officials in 
this affair." 
</P>
<P>
It gave the South Africans one week to withdraw First Secretary for Information 
Jan H.P. Castelyn, Counselor Jonathan Fourie and Staff Sgt. Mark Brunner, who 
works in the defense attache's office. 
</P>
<P>
While there was no suggestion they were implicated in the affair, their 
expulsion is a rebuff at a time when Pretoria's relations with Britain seemed 
to be improving. 
</P>
<P>
It came two weeks after French police raided a Paris address and arrested a 
South African diplomat, an American arms dealer and three militant Protestants 
from Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missile Parts 
</P>
<P>
The Northern Irelanders, one a warrant officer in the province's Territorial 
Army, allegedly were handing over parts of a Blowpipe, a shoulder-fired 
anti-aircraft missile manufactured in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
British officials say they are gravely concerned by charges the South Africans 
were supplying weapons to the Protestants in exchange for the missile parts. 
</P>
<P>
The arrested South African, identified by French sources as Daniel Storm, was 
released after claiming diplomatic immunity. A week later, the French 
government expelled three South African officials implicated in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
The three Irishmen and American Douglas Bernhart are being held in France on 
gun-running and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said Permanent Undersecretary Patrick Wright summoned South 
African Ambassador Rae Killen and informed him of the expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
Wright warned that South Africans should be "under no illusions" about how 
gravely London views the affair. 
</P>
<P>
South African President Pieter W. Botha called the Blowpipe affair a 
"transgression" he regretted.

WORLD'S REPORTED AIDS CASES ROSE TO 151,790 IN APRIL

<P>
Reported global cases of AIDS rose by 5,221, or 3.56%, in April to a total 
151,790 at the end of the month, the World Health Organization said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The United States accounted for more than half of the increase, with 2,845 new 
cases reported to the U.N. health agency. The U.S. total of 89,501 AIDS cases 
as of April 30 represented 59% of the world figure. 
</P>
<P>
"But updated reports basically were received only from the United States and 
European countries," a WHO official explained. 
</P>
<P>
WHO tabulations showed that figures last supplied by the most affected African 
and Latin American countries were as much as six or even 12 months old. 
</P>
<P>
This distorts any list of the most affected countries because totals for many 
of them are far out of date. 
</P>
<P>
The world total is cumulative since the first acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome cases were registered by WHO in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
WHO experts also believe the true total to be at least double the known 
reported figure because many developing countries, especially in Africa, lack 
adequate facilities for tracing and diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
By geographical region, totals and most affected nations on the basis of 
reports available to WHO are as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Africa: 23,262 (Burundi 1,408, Congo 1,250, Kenya 2,732, Malawi 2,586, 
Rwanda 987, Uganda 5,998, Tanzania 4,158, Zambia 1,296). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Americas: 105,612 (Brazil 5,712, Canada 2,449, Haiti 1,849, Mexico 2,158, 
U.S. 89,501). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Asia/Mideast: 369 (Israel 79, Japan 97). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Europe: 21,136 (France 6,409, West Germany, 3,086, Italy 3,494, Netherlands 
791, Spain 2,165, Switzerland 806, United Kingdom 2,192).

10 MORE CHILDREN GET AIDS VIRUS; 
</P>
<P>
APPARENTLY INFECTED BY TAINTED SYRINGES IN SOVIET HOSPITAL 
</P>

<P>
Ten more Soviet children have been infected with the AIDS virus, apparently by 
doctors and nurses in Volgograd using syringes that had not been sterilized 
after injections given other infected children, the government newspaper 
Izvestia said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The case was the second of its kind, according to Soviet officials, and AIDS 
now appears to be spreading as fast through the country's health care system as 
through sexual contacts. 
</P>
<P>
The Volgograd children, who have been identified only in the past week as 
carriers of the human immunodeficiency virus, had been patients in the 
pulmonary ward of a city clinic early this year or late last year when other 
children were sent there for treatment of what only later were discovered to be 
AIDS-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Those children, from the city of Elista near the Caspian Sea, had themselves 
been infected with the virus through contaminated syringes. Altogether, 46 
children and 10 adults were infected at the Elista hospital, government 
officials said in their most recent report on the situation there. One child 
has died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20-Century Plague 
</P>
<P>
In a report headlined, "Cause of Infection, A Dirty Syringe," Izvestia said: 
</P>
<P>
"This plague of the 20th Century has found a unique way into our country -- the 
sloppiness and backwardness of our health care and the slovenly ways of our 
medical personnel. Patients get injections with whatever is handy, and the 
result is AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
The growing popular and political demands for extra caution had no impact on 
the staff of Volgograd Clinic No. 7, Izvestia said, implying that this could be 
the rule rather than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
That children were being infected with the virus was doubly tragic, Izvestia 
said, for they had no way of knowing or checking what kind of medical equipment 
was being used and what kind of care they were receiving. 
</P>
<P>
The Volgograd case is particularly worrying, Izvestia commented, because many 
Elista children were sent for medical treatment to other cities, including such 
regional centers as Moscow, Rostov and Astrakhan, before medical authorities 
recognized that they were suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 
or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim Pokrovsky, head of a special AIDS laboratory at the Soviet Union's 
Central Epidemiological Research Institute, told Izvestia that the AIDS 
outbreak in Elista had probably started last May, not in January when it was 
identified, and there was fear that the disease may have spread much farther -- 
largerly through the health care system -- than had been realized. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patients Routinely Transferred 
</P>
<P>
Under the Soviet Union's state-run medical system, patients are routinely 
transferred from clinic to hospital to district hospital to regional and even 
national medical centers for specialized treatment or to ease overcrowding of 
local facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is impossible to be certain that the Elista patients brought AIDS 
to Volgograd, Izvestia said, there was no doubt that the spread of the virus 
was "due to the notorious lack of disposable syringes and a worthless system of 
sterilization," both of which have been a national scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of children were checked in Moscow when the AIDS connection was 
discovered with the Elista patients, Izvestia said, adding that "there is no 
guarantee that medical personnel in Volgograd were so meticulous." 
</P>
<P>
Their condition had been discovered, health officials said, in the course of 
regular examinations of "those with grave diseases characteristic of those with 
immunodeficiency." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of children are now belatedly being tested in Volgograd, though it is 
proving difficult to trace them five to nine months after their hospitalization 
and possible infection, and "urgent measures are being taken to prevent the 
further proliferation" of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Disposable syringes, which are in extremely short supply here, are being rushed 
to the area along with "other medical equipment," presumably sterilizers. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal investigation, presumably into possible negligence by clinic 
personnel, has been opened by the state prosecutor's office in Volgograd. 
</P>
<P>
Before the latest cases, Soviet health authorities had identified 192 Soviet 
citizens and 378 foreigners as carriers of the AIDS virus. So far, six people 
-- three Soviet citizens and three foreigners -- have died of AIDS-related 
diseases, according to official figures. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 Volgograd children were all reported in "satisfactory condition" and at 
home under medical supervision. None has died so far, health authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
As AIDS has spread over the past year, Soviet commentators have raged against 
the Health Ministry and the medical authorities, demanding that they enforce 
basic discipline in hospitals and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Laws Demanded 
</P>
<P>
"Whose butt will it be tomorrow that a moronic and yawning nurse drives her 
dirty needle into?" Oleg Moroz, the medical writer of the respected weekly 
newspaper Literary Gazette, wrote angrily last month. 
</P>
<P>
Moroz and others have called for a special law on AIDS, laying down the rights 
and responsibilities of AIDS sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy in Elista showed that it's roulette," he said. "No one can 
confidently rely on his prudent behavior as a safeguard." 
</P>
<P>
Without such a law, he said, in an argument echoed by Izvestia on Friday, those 
infected with AIDS through no fault of their own could become social outcasts, 
and some might in turn refuse to take the necessary precautions to prevent the 
spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS sufferers have been "subjected to persecution by enraged mobs," Izvestia 
recalled. There have also been "officially organized ousters of the family 
members from their jobs" for fear that the virus would spread.

PANAMA'S VOTE: ALL NOTES ARE SOUR; 
</P>
<P>
MUDSLINGING TAKEN TO NEW LOWS BY BOTH SIDES IN CAMPAIGN 
</P>

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Panamanian election campaign is to political debate what a screech is to a 
Beethoven symphony. Both are noises, but the similarity ends there. 
</P>
<P>
It is widely assumed that the outcome of Sunday's voting will be determined by 
fraud, and "traitor" is the kindest characterization of the opposition 
candidates by the government party of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, Panama's 
strongman. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the campaign is exemplified by Critica, the country's largest 
newspaper, which makes the most lurid American supermarket tabloid look mild by 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's issue of Critica contained a front-page story about Guillermo Ford, 
one of the two vice presidential candidates of the anti-Noriega coalition 
called the Civic Opposition Democratic Alliance. It accused him of drugging and 
raping a young girl. 
</P>
<P>
The headline, printed in red in outsize type, made an obscene play on Ford's 
party's symbol and the fact that his voice is hoarse. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, fearful of provoking the government into violence -- and 
possibly into canceling the election -- has been more restrained in its public 
attacks on Carlos Duque, Noriega's handpicked candidate to head the ticket of 
the Nationalist Liberation Coalition, an alliance formed around the ruling 
party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Black Sheep Scum' 
</P>
<P>
Still, the opposition distributes mimeographed sheets that refer to Duque, who 
never got beyond high school, as an illiterate and the "black sheep scum" of 
his prominent family. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is often called "pineapple face," a reference to his scarred 
complexion. Opposition rallies feature a coffin with a pineapple on top. 
</P>
<P>
But the Nationalist Coalition goes further. In March, armed members of the 
party raided a building occupied by the Christian Democratic Party, one of the 
three main elements of the anti-Noriega alliance. The building was ransacked 
and then burned down. 
</P>
<P>
"If Watergate was an attack on the American constitutional and political 
system, what can you possibly call this government's tactics?" a Western 
diplomat -- not an American -- asked the other day. 
</P>
<P>
The Noriega forces have conducted a campaign of intimidation against the 
foreign journalists here to report on the campaign. They threaten to arrest and 
deport journalists who report any tabulation of the vote other than the 
official results to be issued Monday by the government-controlled Electoral 
Tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
Government security agents have taken control of the Marriott Hotel, where many 
foreign correspondents are staying. They follow reporters around the lobby and 
other public areas and prohibit television crews from conducting interviews in 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
At least one American reporter, Charles Lane of Newsweek magazine, was detained 
by security personnel. Others have been evicted from the Marriott and forbidden 
to use its facilities. There is evidence that reporters' telephone 
conversations and news transmissions are monitored. 
</P>
<P>
The level of the campaign is not helped by the candidates themselves. Duque, 
described even by his enemies as "a nice man," is best known in Panama as the 
head of Transit S.A., a military-dominated company that controls all imports 
and exports through Panama's free trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ship or receive anything without paying Duque," a man who does 
business in the zone said. "The cost is 1% of the value of the shipment and a 
surcharge for each container. For instance, Duque gets a dollar for every 
carton of cigarettes shipped." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition and diplomatic sources say that Duque, who began his business life 
as a driver and civilian aide for the late military strongman Omar Torrijos, is 
said to have won Noriega's favor by giving the general and other military 
officers large shares of Transit S.A. funds. 
</P>
<P>
Duque, who is overweight and speaks with a wheeze, was selected by Noriega to 
run for president because of his fealty and his lack of personal political 
ambition, according to sources close to the government coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Endara, presidential candidate of the three-party opposition 
alliance, is regarded even by supporters as the least popular of the three men 
at the top of the alliance slate. 
</P>
<P>
He was selected to head the ticket as the least objectionable choice when 
opposition leaders found they could not agree on more prominent politicians, 
among them Ford and the alliance's other vice presidential candidate, Ricardo 
Arias Calderon, head of the Christian Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the leaders (of the three alliance parties) could agree on who would 
run," a diplomat said. "So they picked the least offensive, to themselves and 
to Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
Even though both presidential candidates are fronting for others -- Duque for 
Noriega and Endara for his better-known vice presidential candidates -- the 
rhetoric on both sides almost suggests that the race is between two men now 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Duque and his followers constantly call up the memory of Torrijos, a 
charismatic and popular military dictator whose government negotiated the 
treaties under which the United States agreed to turn the Panama Canal over to 
this country. Torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Endara invokes the ghost of Arnulfo Arias Madrid, a nationalistic, populist 
politician who was elected president three times and was three times deposed by 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
There is a further irony in the presidential race. Although the names of Arias 
and Torrijos are cited in the name of democracy, neither was a champion of 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Torrijos' power rested with the military, and Arias was an acknowledged admirer 
of European fascism.

Former President Jimmy Carter joined fellow ex-President Gerald R. Ford on 
Friday to help monitor Panama's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Carter said, "The process of democratization of Panama 
has been very slow, and that is one of the reasons we decided to come here to 
monitor the elections." 
</P>
<P>
Ford arrived Thursday night as part of an delegation headed by Carter under the 
auspices of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government. Carter is 
chairman of the private council. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate government reaction to Friday's announcement in 
Washington that President Bush is sending an official delegation of 14 U.S. 
observers headed by Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) to monitor the elections. 
</P>
<P>
The official U.S. delegation is to arrive today at the U.S. Howard Air Force 
Base, thereby avoiding Panama's requirement for entrance visas.

NEW CALEDONIA VOTE POSTPONED IN WAKE OF ASSASSINATIONS

French Premier Michel Rocard said Friday that he is postponing local elections 
in New Caledonia after the assassinations of two moderate separatist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
He said elections, set for June 11, are being suspended to allow a period of 
mourning for Jean-Marie Tjibaou, 53, and his deputy, Yeiwene Yeiwene. Rocard 
commented on the situation in the South Pacific territory before leaving Paris 
to attend the funerals of the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Rocard's announcement effectively derailed the schedule for a transfer of power 
by Paris, which imposed direct rule over New Caledonia last year, to regional 
councils that were to have been established in the June election. Rocard gave 
no indication of when the rescheduled vote might take place. 
</P>
<P>
Tjibaou and Yeiwene, president and secretary general, respectively, of the 
separatist Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, were shot dead by 
hard-line separatist Djubelly Wea on Thursday on the island of Ouvea. 
</P>
<P>
Wea shouted "Long live independence!" as he shot Tjibaou in the head. Tjibaou 
died instantly, while Yeiwene died later in the hospital. Wea was killed by one 
of Tjibaou's bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
The elections were part of a pact signed last August ending a long period of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Rocard told Radio France Internationale that he would not give up his battle to 
end violence in New Caledonia. He denied that the peace plan, which he 
negotiated, is in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to mobilize more energy, more strength and more conviction," he said.

U.N. MEETING VOWS TO BAN OZONE-KILLING CHEMICALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Delegates from 81 countries closed a U.N. conference Friday with a pledge to 
end by the year 2000 the production and use of chemicals that are rapidly 
destroying the Earth's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
The Helsinki delegates, who represented most of the world's population, also 
agreed to set up a system to help Third World countries pay to replace 
equipment or Western-imported consumer products that emit the chemicals. But 
they left open how much aid will be involved, how the industrial countries will 
finance it and who will control it. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the four-day meeting said ozone is being lost much more quickly 
than envisioned in 1987, when leading producers of ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, agreed in Montreal to cut emissions in half by 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mostafa K. Tolba, director of the U.N. Environment Program, told 
delegates in Helsinki that the situation represents "an environmental 
time-bomb." 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are most commonly used in refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosols and 
cleaning materials for the metal and electronics industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skin Cancer, Eye Disease 
</P>
<P>
When they rise into the atmosphere, they damage the ozone layer that blocks 
some of the sun's ultraviolet rays. Scientists say the extra radiation 
increases cases of skin cancer and eye disease and damages plants and animals 
crucial to the natural food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates in Helsinki unanimously adopted their declaration to phase out the 
production and consumption of CFCs worldwide by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the accord was the United States, the world's largest producer of 
CFCs. It makes nearly 40% of the chemicals and consumes about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates also said they would phase out halons, which are ozone-destroying 
gases used in sprinkler systems and fire extinguishers. They gave no target 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Tolba told a news conference Friday that the Helsinki meeting "exceeded all 
expectations" and succeeded in a "translation of words into actions." 
</P>
<P>
But the Helsinki Declaration does not become legally binding unless it as 
adopted as an addendum to the Montreal Protocol. A follow-up meeting is 
scheduled in London next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates in Helsinki energetically debated proposals to set up the fund to 
help developing countries conform to treaty requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial countries argued that setting up a bureaucracy to oversee the fund 
could waste money better spent on aid. 
</P>
<P>
Developing countries said they wanted assurances that the fund would not take 
money from other aid projects such as housing. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups, which were among more than 100 observers at the closed 
meetings, charged that the declaration was "purposely kept vague on all major 
points." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Greenpeace said other hazardous chemicals should have been 
added to five CFCs and three halons to be cut in half under the Montreal pact. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists from industrial countries joined the international environmental 
group Greenpeace in arguing that carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform, 
which are used in solvents, should be banned. They said the chemicals have a 
much greater ozone-depleting potential than CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
The two chemicals escaped the original ban because they are short-lived once 
released into the air. CFCs have an atmospheric life of up to 100 years.

FEARING ETHICS PROBE, THEY RETURN EXPENSIVE PERFUME;

<P>
With the current emphasis on ethics in the nation's capital, even the sweetest 
perfume can sometimes take on the smell of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
That is what occurred recently when some members of Congress discovered that 
their wives had received a one-ounce sample of a new perfume called "Red" 
valued at $175 from Giorgio of Beverly Hills earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress are prohibited from accepting gifts valued in excess of 
$100 from corporations that have an interest in legislation, and that rule is 
clearly on the minds of most House members these days because of the current 
ethics investigation of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might Violate Rule 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that Giorgio's perfume gift might violate this rule, a number of House 
members decided earlier this week to mail the sample back to Giorgio, according 
to sources. It was not known exactly how many bottles were returned. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows how the ethical climate has changed in Washington," remarked one 
House Democrat who returned his perfume and declined to be identified. "In the 
past, nobody would have thought twice about accepting a free sample of 
perfume." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was shocked when he discovered the retail price of the perfume. He 
said both he and his wife had been unaware of its value when they opened the 
gift last January after returning to Washington from the Christmas recess. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, House members said they were advised by employees of the House 
Ethics Committee that the perfume should be returned if the bottle was still 
more than half full. If more than half was gone, they were told to send $175 to 
the perfume manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
However, a committee spokesman said, Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) 
ruled on Friday that Giorgio's gift did not violate House rules because it was 
received before the perfume went on the retail market and thus had no known 
value then. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been $2; it could have been $2,000," said the committee aide. 
</P>
<P>
At Giorgio headquarters in Santa Monica, company spokeswoman Jackie Cohen said 
her firm had not yet received any returned bottles of Red from members of 
Congress. And she bolstered the committee's ruling by noting that the fragrance 
costs "less than $100" an ounce wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cohen, the samples were sent to 5,000 prominent women, including 
some congressional wives, as part of a Christmas promotion for the perfume 
before its introduction in retail stores.

200 PROTESTING INDIAN SPEARFISHING ARRESTED

Police arrested about 200 protesters who gathered at Trout Lake to oppose a 
judge's decision extending the spearfishing season of the Chippewa Indians. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people staged a protest at the northern Wisconsin lake, 
objecting to U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb's decision not to halt the 
spearfishing at midnight Friday. The state of Wisconsin had sought an 
injunction to stop the spearfishing season as the general season opened today. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions of 19th-Century treaties give the Chippewa wide latitude to gather 
food throughout much of Northern Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in five years, the spearfishing and non-Indian fishing 
seasons overlapped, largely because the late winter left waters frozen and too 
cold for the spawning of the walleye. 
</P>
<P>
In Madison, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson appealed for peace between Indian and 
non-Indian fishermen.

The parents of a 6-week-old girl whose body was found in a trash barrel in 
Missouri are suspects in the death, investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert and Paula Sims had told authorities the baby, Heather, was abducted in 
the same manner as another infant daughter three years ago, who also was found 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus of the investigation is now leading to the parents," said Detective 
Sgt. Rick McCain of the Alton Police Department. "An arrest is forthcoming," he 
said, without indicating exactly when. 
</P>
<P>
A search late Thursday of the couple's home and the home of Paula Sims' mother 
produced valuable evidence, McCain said. 
</P>

Dr. Mary Case, the St. Charles County medical examiner, would not comment on 
the cause of death of the infant, found Wednesday night, other than that it was 
a homicide.

Cook County's medical examiner said Friday he has not declared a homicide in 
the death of a toddler whose father is charged with murder for removing the 
comatose boy from a hospital life-support system. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Stein said that for now he has ruled the manner of Samuel Linares' 
death "undetermined" while declaring the immediate cause to be a lack of oxygen 
to the brain caused by the boy's choking on a balloon last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The termination of mechanical life support was a contributing factor, but not 
the immediate cause of 16-month-old Samuel's death, Stein wrote on the death 
certificate following an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor said he would amend the certificate later to include the manner of 
death, but refused to say when that might be. The other possibilities are 
homicide, accident, natural causes and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Rudolfo Linares, the boy's father, said Stein's action bolstered 
their defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never come across a case where if the medical examiner did not determine 
there was a homicide, you could come up with murder," said Kevin Smith, one of 
three public defenders representing Linares. 
</P>
<P>
State's Atty. Cecil Partee could not comment on the case because the county 
grand jury investigation is still under way, said spokeswoman Kiki 
Kryiakopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Illinois Department of Public Aid said that Linares 
removed his son from the breathing apparatus about three weeks before the state 
was set to cut off public assistance that had covered about $105,000 in medical 
costs for the child. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Kustra, assistant director of the agency, said Linares' wife, Tamara, was 
notified in mid-March that she was no longer eligible for public assistance 
because she had failed to cooperate with an investigation into her eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Linares pulled out a gun in his son's hospital room and kept 
hospital staff and police at bay for about 45 minutes while Samuel died in his 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
He was charged with murder and is free on bond.

REFINERIES LACK MEANS TO HANDLE CORROSIVE ACID LEAKS, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Powerine Oil Co.'s refinery in Santa Fe Springs does not have special equipment 
to handle a leak of highly corrosive hydrofluoric acid, according to a report 
presented Friday to the board of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
</P>
<P>
And, based on information contained in the report, the special water spray 
safety systems at another Los Angeles-area refinery -- Golden West Refining 
Co.'s facility in Santa Fe Springs -- and at Allied Signal Corp.'s El Segundo 
chemical plant are not adequate to deal with a major leak, said David Schwien, 
a member of the air quality agency's task force studying hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the Powerine refinery does not have a water spray 
system designed to mitigate a hydrofluoric acid release. The refinery, which 
typically has 9,600 gallons of the acid on hand, does have a firefighting water 
system. Powerine officials told the air quality agency that they intend to put 
in a water spray system but are waiting for the industry to make available 
newly designed equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Allied Signal and Golden West officials said they are planning to upgrade their 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Schwien said he compared the capabilities of safety systems at the five largest 
users of the corrosive chemical with data from the largest known release of 
hydrofluoric acid, a 1987 accident at the Marathon Oil refinery in Texas City, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
In that accident on Oct. 30, 1987, about 7,000 gallons of the corrosive 
substance leaked out in a 100-minute interval after an 80-ton piece of 
equipment was dropped on a pipe leading to a tank containing the acid. About 
650 people were injured, 3,000 were evacuated and trees were defoliated for 
miles. The EPA said last week that the Texas City accident had the potential of 
being as severe as the methyl isocyanate release in Bhopal, India, in 1984 that 
killed about 3,000 and injured about 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Schwien said refinery and industry data indicate that a release at the average 
spill rate in the Texas City accident -- 70 gallons a minute -- would overwhelm 
existing water spray safety systems at Allied Signal and Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Allied Signal can handle releases of no more than 21 
gallons a minute; the Golden West refinery in Santa Fe Springs can handle eight 
gallons a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Oil's Torrance refinery and Ultramar Refining's Wilmington facility are 
the area's two largest users of hydrofluoric acid. Both facilities have 
considerably larger water spray systems, although company officials 
acknowledged that a huge disaster -- such as a plane falling on a hydrofluoric 
tank -- could overwhelm their systems. 
</P>
<P>
The five companies keep thousands of gallons of the acid on hand. Oil 
refineries use it as one of two possible catalysts -- the other is sulfuric 
acid -- to boost the octane number of unleaded gasoline. Allied Signal uses the 
acid to manufacture refrigerants. 
</P>
<P>
The study presented Friday was the second update on the progress of the 
agency's hydrofluoric acid task force, formed in January, 1988, after two 
accidents involving the corrosive chemical to study whether to regulate or 
eliminate use of the acid in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The Marathon Oil accident was one of the accidents focusing attention on 
hydrofluoric acid. The other was a thunderous explosion and two-day fire at 
Mobil's Torrance refinery in November, 1987, during which 100 pounds of the 
substance was released. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Lethal 
</P>
<P>
According to industry-sponsored tests conducted in the Nevada desert in 1986, a 
release of hydrofluoric acid forms a dense, ground-hugging cloud of gas and 
small droplets that, following a two-minute, 1,000-gallon spill, could prove 
lethal as far as five miles downwind. Follow-up tests in Nevada in 1988 showed 
that water sprays must drench the acid in a 40-to-1 ratio of water to acid to 
reduce toxic fumes by 90% -- a comparatively safe level. 
</P>
<P>
Using the 40-to-1 standard, the report said, the best water spray system 
currently operating at major hydrofluoric acid users in the Los Angeles area is 
a 9,000-gallon-a-minute system at the Ultramar refinery, which could handle a 
leak of 225 gallons a minute. At Mobil's refinery, the water spray system could 
take care of a hydrofluoric acid leak of 78 gallons a minute. 
</P>
<P>
No agency working on risk assessment for hydrofluoric acid has determined 
exactly how big a water spray system should be to handle disasters. But Schwien 
said the Texas City accident offers a valid case study. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not fiction. It is not fantasy. It happened. Three of these systems -- 
at Powerine, Golden West and Allied Signal -- appear not to have (water spray) 
systems able to handle the sort of accident that happened at Marathon Oil. In 
that accident, according to refinery figures, the average spill rate was about 
70 gallons a minute." 
</P>
<P>
Allied Signal plant manager Joseph Barnett said, "While it is true that our 
system could not handle a leak of 70 gallons a minute, the sort of leak that 
occurred at Texas City is very unlikely because of precautions we have taken." 
</P>
<P>
Golden West refinery manager John Miller said the facility was beginning a risk 
study at the request of the city of Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
At Ultramar, refinery manager Marshal A. (Bud) Bell acknowledged that "you can 
conjure up a scenario that nobody, including us, can handle." 
</P>
<P>
"But in the real world," he added, "when we did our disaster scenario modeling, 
the most credible leak we came up with was a pump seal failure." Bell said that 
Ultramar's water spray system easily could handle that sort of hydrofluoric 
acid leak. 
</P>
<P>
At Mobil, refinery officials are increasing their water system and are planning 
to install large holding tanks to drain acid rapidly from processing units in 
the event of a rupture.

TAKING OIL CLEANUP GEAR TO ALASKA PUT CALIFORNIA AT RISK, PANEL STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's defense against a major oil spill was seriously weakened by an oil 
industry decision to rush available cleanup equipment to Alaska to cope with 
the Exxon Valdez disaster, the California Coastal Commission charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The commission and the U.S. Minerals Management Service, which oversees oil and 
gas development in federal waters, said one of three major vessels, Mr. Clean 
III, on alert in case of an oil spill in the Santa Barbara area, was dispatched 
without permission to Prince William Sound on April 9 by Clean Seas, a 
consortium of 17 major oil and pipeline companies. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until April 20 that a comparably sized ship was on hand to replace 
Mr. Clean III. 
</P>
<P>
The 181-foot vessel is equipped with 3,000 feet of boom to contain oil spills, 
two skimmer systems that each pump 750 gallons a minute and a third with a 
400-gallons-a-minute pumping capacity, and storage capacity for 1,200 barrels. 
</P>
<P>
So alarmed was the commission by the ship's redeployment to Alaska that it 
urged the U.S. Minerals Management Service to immediately forbid any oil and 
gas exploration and production in the Point Arguello area until the vessel 
returned to California waters. 
</P>
<P>
The Minerals Management Service did not halt exploration; production in that 
field is expected to begin in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
But the MMS did issue an "incident of noncompliance." 
</P>
<P>
"Previously agreed-to notification procedures were ignored. . . . Disregard for 
approved procedures is not acceptable and cannot be tolerated in the future," 
Thomas W. Dunaway, regional MMS director, said in an April 20 letter to Texaco, 
one of the oil companies involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Any future incident of this nature will result in more stringent MMS action 
such as civil penalty and/or shutdown of production and drilling operations," 
Dunaway wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually found out through the rumor mill," said Susan M. Hansch, manager 
of the Coastal Commission's energy and ocean resources unit. She added: "We 
understand why they were sending mutual aid. We just don't want to protect one 
area and leave another area without the proper defenses." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Minerals Management Service, Hansch wrote: "The oil spill 
response vessel was removed from its location in the Point Arguello offshore 
area and sent to Alaska without our knowledge or consent. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Skip Onstad, manager of Clean Seas, denied Friday that the ability to meet an 
oil spill emergency was ever in question. 
</P>
<P>
He said Mr. Clean III was replaced initially with the Jolly Roger, a smaller 
ship with less oil storage capacity. Onstad said that the Jolly Roger was not 
replaced by a larger ship, the Gulf Fleet 69, until the Coastal Commission 
intervened on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have satisfied their concerns concerning the overall response 
capability of the (Clean Seas) organization and see no reason why exploration 
drilling or any other drilling shouldn't be allowed to continue," Onstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Onstad said he attempted to notify the MMS on April 8 of the intention to send 
Mr. Clean III to Alaska but was unable to reach authorities. The ship left the 
next day, and MMS was notified on April 10. The Coastal Commission did not 
learn of the redeployment until April 19. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaskan oil spill occurred March 24 when the supertanker Exxon Valdez ran 
aground in Prince William Sound on Bligh Reef, spilling 11 million gallons of 
crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
J. Lisle Reed, regional director of the MMS, said Friday that the ship movement 
was not as serious as the Coastal Commission believed. "I don't think you can 
say it was a serious situation that seriously impaired things," Reed said. But 
he added, "We live here in constant memory of the (Jan. 23, 1969) Santa Barbara 
oil spill, when we weren't prepared."

5,000 IN FILLMORE FLEE TOXIC THREAT FROM FIRE 
</P>

The threat of toxic fumes from a fire at a garden store forced 5,000 residents 
of this Ventura County farming community from their homes overnight, but they 
returned early Friday morning after the blaze had nearly burned itself out. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are investigating the possibility of arson in the fire, which 
leveled Dewey's Garden Center and caused $250,000 damage as nearly half of the 
city's 11,000 residents were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
A few spots still smoldered in the blackened rubble Friday as firefighters 
stood back, waiting for the fire, which was fueled by pesticides, herbicides 
and swimming pool supplies, to extinguish itself. 
</P>
<P>
They feared exposure to rodent poison containing arsenic and cyanide, which is 
easily absorbed through the skin, and swimming pool supplies containing 
chlorine, whose fumes can cause lung damage, said Pat Askren, chief of 
Fillmore's volunteer fire department. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago we would have fought this fire," he said, "but now we're so 
aware of the potential for damage to firefighters." 
</P>
<P>
The only reports of injury among the 125 fire and law enforcement officers at 
the scene came from two Police Explorer Scouts, who were treated at a local 
hospital and released after complaining about tingling sensations in their 
throats. 
</P>
<P>
Specialists from Ventura County's Environmental Health Department had advised 
firefighters against directing water at the flames, fearing the runoff would be 
toxic, said Dana Determan, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
However, air and water samples taken at the fire, which was reported at 11 p.m. 
Thursday, showed no signs of toxics, Determan said. The fire, which was also 
stoked by fertilizers and older, wooden sections of the structure, was believed 
to have burned at such a high temperature that it incinerated toxic substances 
before they could vaporize, said Steve Kephart, a county environmental health 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so hot that the fire basically destroyed all the chemicals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was confined to the shed-like structure, parts of which dated back 100 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary, very scary," said Nellie Chavez, 74. "The flames were so big for 
such a small place and the smoke was very black." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the city's Eastside were directed to a Red Cross shelter in nearby 
Fillmore High School but were moved to three churches farther from the fire as 
winds swirled the smoke throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a campfire," Askren said. "Wherever you went, the smoke followed." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the garden store, Gayron Downs of Piru, doubted he could rebuild 
it. "I'm still kind of in shock," he said. "Our insurance policy is quite old 
and the cost of construction has escalated." 
</P>
<P>
An arson investigator was pessimistic about determining the cause of the fire, 
which officials described as suspicious in origin, because it had been allowed 
to burn itself out. 
</P>
<P>
"Water has a really nice way of preserving the point of origin," said Peter 
Cronk, an investigations specialist with the Ventura County Fire Department.

KABOODLE MAKES GREAT THEATER FROM LITTLE KIT

I knew I was in the right place Thursday night as I stumped upa drafty flight 
of stairs on 8th Avenue, to a performance art joint called Sushi. 
</P>
<P>
Call it kismet. Call it a hunch. I was on the trail of great theater, and all 
signs pointed to Sushi. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, a limey stage company named Kaboodle was in residence. The 
seven-member troupe, with four actors, one musician, a stage manager and 
administrator, had the look of a lean, mean acting machine. 
</P>
<P>
Their show, "Rasputin: The Forbidden Story," is a pip, performed with the 
energy of two freight trains. The story of Rasputin, the mystic peasant monk of 
Siberia who charmed the empress of Russia, is one of the fantastic tales of the 
century, and the Kaboodle actors tell it with zesty abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Today you hear about high-technology theater. This is low-tech theater: four 
actors, a musician and a trunk. With only a foot locker and a few other props 
and scenic pieces, the troupe becomes a thespian magic act, conjuring up the 
wastelands of central Russia, a steamer crossing the Atlantic, a boxing ring 
and a walk-in ice cream freezer. Using the foot locker and refrigerator with 
the precision of surgical devices, they create the unforgettable sights and 
sounds of a headlong rush to grab a moving train. 
</P>
<P>
Their stock in trade is hilarity and a subversive approach that will make you 
forever question history books. 
</P>
<P>
Kaboodle's version of the Rasputin tale, based on a novel by Michel Tournier, 
claims the FBI suppressed the real story. As related by a hard-boiled reporter 
named O'Hara from the New York Enquirer, Rasputin did not die in St. 
Petersburg. Yes, he was poisoned, shot, trussed and thrown into the icy Neva 
River by a cabal of aristos from the imperial court. But, according to O'Hara, 
he was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
A little Jewish man named Simonovich pulled Rasputin from the frigid waters, 
revived him, and the pair then fled, with more adventures, to America, only to 
be destroyed amid the swamps outside New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Rasputin is a hoodoo mystic, all right, but instead of being a smooth operator, 
he goes with his natural, basic impulses a little like Mozart does in 
"Amadeus." To him, war is a chump's game, and that thought is a slap in the 
face to the court aristocrats, who believe otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
But Rasputin was not around to write his history. The aristos wrote it, and, he 
tells us, they lied. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Lee Beagley plays Rasputin the pilgrim as a scruffy-looking character, 
who admits he has a penchant for sex, but then, don't we all? It's a tough 
role, but Beagley makes the audience believe, whether cavorting with Paris 
hookers or comforting a bleeding and beaten New Orleans voodoo woman. 
</P>
<P>
Beagley's thespian partner, Steve Howe, plays Simonovich as a runty little 
survivor. Howe creates a mensch that is a tightly wound whirling dervish, 
spinning around the stage, at once alienating our affections while craving 
them. Howe gets my vote for one of the most energetic performances of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Denise Evans' throaty voice suggests cigarettes, hard living and 
straight whiskey in her portrayal of the no-nonsense O'Hara, who tracks 
Simonovich to a death row cell in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Aiken, wearing little more than a ratty slip, skillfully lines out an 
exotic assortment of women, from the empress of Russia to a nose-in-the-air 
English woman to a Paris prostitute and Queenie, the voodoo woman. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Daye's musical accompaniment on several guitars, a mandolin, keyboard and 
vocals offers subtle and often humorous support. A variety of music, from the 
"1812 Overture" to the old slave lament "Take This Message," provides pointed 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara was right. There are a million stories in the city. Sometimes the story 
gets away. Sometimes you get the story. Sometimes the story gets you. 
</P>
<P>

BRISK BUSINESS AT DAY SALE SHOWS POP ART'S BOUNDING STRENGTH

"Somebody is printing the stuff. It can't be real money," hissed a woman 
struggling through the crowd at Sotheby's auction house. 
</P>
<P>
She wasn't talking about the multimillion-dollar prices being paid for 
contemporary art at this week's most exclusive auctions. Her joke was leveled 
at what used to be called the bottom end of the market, the "Part II" day sales 
of relatively low-priced works that traditionally follow splashy, big-ticket 
evening events. 
</P>
<P>
Once poorly attended and still rarely publicized beyond the auction houses' 
mailing lists, these sales have changed from quiet opportunities for the trade 
to public spectacles as the market for contemporary art has escalated. You can 
still walk in without a ticket, but you may not be able to find a seat, and 
unless you are willing to shell out several thousand dollars -- or hundreds of 
thousands -- you will not be able to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Watching is fascinating, however, for these rambling sales of everything from 
major works by minor artists and vice versa to aesthetic curiosities sometimes 
reveal trends more clearly than the more prestigious auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious trend -- that contemporary art is selling better than ever -- 
is not news. Another, only slightly more subtle, is the bounding strength of 
Pop art in general and Andy Warhol in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Warhol is a cult figure whose seminal position in the Pop movement and untimely 
death, followed by a major retrospective exhibition, have ensured that prime 
examples of his work will bring extraordinary prices. But before Japanese 
dealer Kazuo Fujii paid a record $4 million for "Shot Red Marilyn," other 
collectors were snapping up every insignificant Warhol in sight at Part II of 
Sotheby's contemporary sale. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty Warhols were in Sotheby's day sale Wednesday and an equal number were 
offered Thursday at Christie's. The first to go under the gavel at Sotheby's 
was an ordinary Coca-Cola bottle covered with gold leaf and collage that was a 
gift to curator Henry Geldzahler in 1962. The catalogue estimate for the piece 
(which directors of Warhol's foundation say is nothing more than a "souvenir" 
or "house gift") was $20,000 to $25,000. After fierce competition, the bottle 
sold for $63,250 to a telephone bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Next came a silk-screened image of a crowd scene, valued at $25,000 to $35,000. 
It brought $77,000. An 8-inch-square painting of hot-pink flowers, estimated at 
$25,000 to $35,000, fetched $55,000. And so it went, except for a few items 
that sold near their estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Warhol's 40-inch-square painting of tennis star Chris Evert, done in 1977, 
brought $88,000 instead of the predicted price of $15,000 to $20,000. "Hammer 
and Sickle," a large red painting of the Soviet symbol, went for $231,000, 
nearly three times its high estimate of $80,000. "Shadows," a dark image 
composed of diamond dust and silkscreened polymer and valued at $40,000 to 
$60,000, fetched $154,000, while a horrific, 10-inch-square self-portrait 
brought $44,000 instead of the estimated $10,000 to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's about time," said Steven Bluttal, a director of the Warhol 
Foundation who logs many auction hours. Though the Warhol retrospective has 
focused attention on the artist and probably promoted sales of some of his more 
difficult images, Bluttal said he thought the market was just beginning to 
catch up with Warhol's significance. 
</P>
<P>
Works by other Pop figures also commanded astonishing prices in the day sales. 
Two painted plaster loaves of bread by Claes Oldenburg, valued at $100,000 to 
$125,000, sold for $220,000. One of Robert Indiana's familiar paintings of the 
word "Love," estimated at $15,000 to $20,000, brought $104,500. Mel Ramos' 
painting "Lucky Lulu," depicting a buxom blond pin-up on a cigarette package, 
sold for $110,000, more than twice its high estimate of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
One can conclude from this that it's a hot time for easy art, but there is also 
evidence of quality-consciousness and a healthy spread of interest into fine 
drawings by artists whose paintings have become unaffordable. A glowing drawing 
of a female nude by David Hockney estimated at $40,000 to $60,000, for example, 
brought $77,000. In Sotheby's Tuesday-night sale, Hockney's exquisite color 
pencil portrait of Henry Geldzahler, from the collection of former New York 
City Councilman Carter Burden, soared to $209,000. The catalogue estimate was 
$70,000 to $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been in the habit of reducing the size of the sale room (with 
partitions) for the day sales because the audience has been smaller," said 
Christie president Christopher Burge in a press conference following the 
Wednesday-night auction. "But now there seem to be twice as many people and 
twice as much art." 
</P>
<P>
By 10:30 Thursday morning, Christie's unpartitioned sale room had standing room 
only and, once again, sales were brisk. Among the successes were early Warhol 
drawings that went for up to four times their estimates and a Tom Wesselmann 
still life from the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation that soared past its 
estimate of $65,000 to $85,000 and finally sold to a telephone bidder for 
$275,000.

MICHIGAN'S ECONOMY STAGES BROAD RECOVERY AFTER ITS NEAR COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state of Michigan is undergoing a striking economic recovery these days, 
with jobs going begging in some areas. In fact, on Friday the state announced 
that its unemployment rate continued to fall, even as the nation's jobless rate 
inched upward. 
</P>
<P>
For Michigan, it's been a long road back. Seven years ago, in fact, this state 
almost went out of business. The recession that gave America an economic cold 
in the early 1980s left the state with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmingly dependent on the auto industry, which found itself in the midst 
of its most traumatic crisis since the 1930s, Michigan suffered nearly a total 
economic collapse. 
</P>
<P>
By 1982 -- when the state's jobless rate peaked at a stunning 17.3% -- an 
eerie, desperate silence had descended on Michigan's industrial heartland. 
</P>
<P>
With tens of thousands of auto workers receiving layoff notices each month, 
plant closings became so numerous that each new idling hardly rated a mention 
in Detroit's newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobless Emigrating to Sun Belt 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's soup kitchens were bulging, and the lines at the state's unemployment 
offices frequently snaked around the block. By December, 1982, a staggering 
750,000 people were out of work in a state with a total population of just 9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Michigan had more unemployed people than lots of states had people," recalls 
Doug Ross, Michigan's commerce secretary. With tax revenue plunging, the 
state's government was so broke that it had to turn to a consortium of Japanese 
banks to pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the highways south to Texas were filling up with what Texans, then still 
riding their oil high, derisively called the "black taggers." They were the new 
Okies, jobless auto workers emigrating to the Sun Belt in search of work, and 
easily identifiable by the black Michigan license plates on their domestic vans 
and cars. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Michigan, once known as the pre-eminent manufacturing center of 
the nation, quickly gained a new reputation: It was dubbed the buckle of the 
Rust Belt, the most depressed state in the most depressed region in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rust Belt reputation had a lot of truth to it at the beginning of the 
decade," concedes Ross. 
</P>
<P>
But today, much of that rust has been scraped away, and Michigan is now in the 
midst of a dramatic economic turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
No longer a basket case, Michigan now has a balanced budget and has become a 
prime example of how a state can survive and flourish in the wake of a 
devastating blow to its main industry. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the economic changes that are helping the entire Rust Belt to recover 
can be seen most dramatically here in Michigan. The rate of job growth since 
1982 has not only outpaced its neighboring states, but the national average as 
well. Thanks to the creation of 616,000 new jobs, Michigan's jobless rate has 
fallen by more than 10 percentage points since 1982 to just 6.1% today, and 
employment is now at an all time high. While the state's unemployment rate 
remains higher than the national average, its dramatic tumble has drawn 
national attention to the turnaround here. In fact, Michigan officials bragged 
Friday, the gap between the state and national unemployment rates in April was 
at its narrowest in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes seem sharper here because we went through a more traumatic 
period," Ross says. "We saw the beast. But you are seeing some aspects of it 
happening in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Market Driven Rebound 
</P>
<P>
Yet Michigan's growth has not come as a result of any grand state policies, or 
from any governmental efforts to target industrial winners and losers, state 
officials and economists agree. "This is a free market phenomenon, this is 
clearly the result of people reacting to market forces," acknowledges Mark 
Murray, a research economist with the state commerce department. 
</P>
<P>
Although Democratic Gov. James J. Blanchard has been credited with reducing 
tensions between state government and the business community, "It is still 
extremely hard to tell the role that government policy has played," says 
University of Michigan economist Paul Courant. "This recovery has primarily 
been market driven." 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps more surprisingly, Michigan's recovery has also not come by 
diversifying away from the auto industry, which has dominated the state's 
economy since the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, growth has come, Ross and others like to say, by diversifying "through 
the auto industry," into new automation-related fields spawned by heavy 
manufacturing's new need to compete with the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The auto industry's demand for robots and other automation equipment has led to 
the creation of dozens of new companies in the Detroit area that are supplying 
advanced manufacturing technology to the Big Three auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
So many of them have located in the area, in order to be near the auto 
companies' headquarters, that a stretch of suburban Detroit from Ann Arbor to 
Troy, Mich., has been dubbed "Automation Alley." 
</P>
<P>
The Alley is now home to some 400 manufacturing technology firms, with $5 
billion in total sales and employing 35,000 workers. Many are actually owned by 
the Big Three -- Electronic Data Systems, General Motors' computer services 
subsidiary, has transferred thousands of workers from its Dallas headquarters 
to the Detroit area to service GM. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won Foreign Customers 
</P>
<P>
Another GM affiliate, GMFanuc, a joint venture between General Motors and Fanuc 
of Japan, is now the largest robot company in America, and is based in Auburn 
Hills, a Detroit suburb on the northeastern end of the alley. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these companies -- involved in such arcane fields as robotics, machine 
vision, and manufacturing applications of artificial intelligence, have now won 
over new customers among the Japanese and European auto makers. Nissan for 
instance, has just opened a big research and development center in Ann Arbor. 
Some firms are branching out into other industries as well, looking for sales 
in the aerospace and appliance industries. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Detroit is fast becoming the new national center for manufacturing 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got here is a critical mass of firms that makes us the intellectual 
center of the action for those trying to find out how you apply new information 
technology to manufacturing," Ross says. 
</P>
<P>
This new technology-based sector has led to rapid growth in service sector 
employment, mostly in the Detroit area, which has more than offset the decline 
in manufacturing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1982, Michigan lost 431,000 jobs, including 292,000 in 
manufacturing, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although just 
94,000 manufacturing jobs were regained by 1987, 557,000 non-manufacturing jobs 
had also been newly created in the state, according to a University of Michigan 
study released at a recent seminar on the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first economic cycle in Michigan in which manufacturing employment 
has declined at the same time that we have had a decline in the unemployment 
rate," observes George Fulton, a University of Michigan economist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear Fed Policies 
</P>
<P>
Other sectors of the state's economy are blossoming as well. The Grand Rapids 
area in western Michigan has regained its status as one of the nation's leading 
centers of furniture manufacturing with a new emphasis on modern office 
furnishings. Meanwhile, plastics manufacturers, established here to serve the 
auto and furniture industries, are now winning over other new customers. State 
officials say 25% of the nation's growth in the plastics industry in 1987 
occurred in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the recovery, the state's economy remains vulnerable. Blanchard 
warned this month that the Federal Reserve Board's recent tight-money, high 
interest rate policies threaten the auto industry as well as Michigan's 
turnaround, and called on other Midwest governors to join him in a protest 
against the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many center-cities in Michigan, like others around the nation, have 
never made it back from the recession of the early '80s. Auto factory towns 
such as Flint and Pontiac and the central city of Detroit, lost plants but have 
not benefitted from the growth in high-technology jobs, which have generally 
gone to affluent suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that you're a GM factory town, you ended up in trouble," Ross 
says. "What has hurt the Flints and the Pontiacs and the Detroits is that they 
had people who couldn't switch over to the new information-based technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem right now is that we have a mismatch of people and jobs."

LONG-TERM FRAUD SEEN AT N.Y. FUTURES MARKETS; 
</P>
<P>
SOURCES CLAIM ILLEGAL PRACTICES BY CLIQUES HAVE CHEATED INVESTORS AND OTHER 
TRADERS FOR YEARS 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after government agents swooped down with subpoenas on New York's biggest 
futures markets, sources familiar with the inner workings of the exchanges said 
Friday that small cliques of traders, exploiting inadequate government 
scrutiny, have long engaged in various illegal practices defrauding both 
investors and other traders. 
</P>
<P>
"Insiders have advantages in terms of trading. That's the source of 
(long-standing) complaints. These markets are not fair, open markets operated 
for the benefit of the public," said Martin R. Gold, whose law firm, Gold, 
Farrell &amp; Marks, handles securities litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the probe said investigators are checking the possibility 
that trades were illegally manipulated to avoid taxes. Also under 
investigations, they said, are allegations that traders tried to escape their 
losses by improperly paying off officials at other firms to declare them 
"errors," which would forces those officials' firms to unwittingly absorb the 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Few details of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation have been 
made public, but initial indications are that it so far has a much narrower 
focus than the ongoing federal probe of the much larger futures exchanges in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Where the Chicago investigation grew from a large-scale sting operation, with 
undercover FBI agents acting as traders, the one in New York is believed to 
have arisen from complaints CFTC received from one or more exchange members. 
Officials have indicated that the FBI is not involved in the New York 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although CFTC has subpoenaed information about dozens of past and present 
members of the four New York exchanges, only a few -- two of whom are 
well-known and influential figures within the markets -- are believed to be at 
the center of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A search warrant was served and records taken from the offices of a firm, MBF 
Clearing Corp., owned by Mark B. Fisher, 28, of Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Also believed to be a target of the investigation is Preston Semel, 39, a 
well-known and controversial figure in the New York commodity trading world. 
Three years ago Semel was fined $5,000 by CFTC to settle a civil complaint in 
which he was accused of a variety of trading violations. 
</P>
<P>
Both Fisher and Semel were reported to have been served subpoenas on Thursday. 
A subpoena is a demand for information, which does not necessarily identify the 
recipient as a target on an investigation. Both declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although business went on as usual at the exchanges, many traders were confused 
and nervous about Thursday's surprise raids. "Listen, I know everybody on this 
floor," said Russell Rosenthal, a Rafferty Associates broker. "Everybody's 
coming over to everybody else and asking what's happening, and nobody knows. 
The only ones who know are the ones whose names have been in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the investigation brought forth a torrent of complaints and 
accusations from traders and others familiar with the exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for Some Honor 
</P>
<P>
"When you walk into the silver pit or the gold pit, you are hoping there will 
be some honor among the traders," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
But often, he said, traders collude and "trample the group trust," with serious 
fraud being "winked at." 
</P>
<P>
The four exchanges -- the Commodity; New York Mercantile; Coffee, Sugar &amp; 
Cocoa and New York Cotton exchanges -- are far smaller than the giant stock and 
bond markets of Wall Street, and all do business on the same trading floor in 
the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
Traders often belong to more than one exchange, and some, including Fisher, are 
members of all. 
</P>
<P>
Buying and selling using in noisy "open outcry" trading pits, traders rely more 
heavily on personal relationships than do their counterparts in securities 
markets, where transactions are handled by computer. 
</P>
<P>
But in this more intimate atmosphere, some of the most powerful are "throwing 
their weight around, doing things for their own advantage," said one source, 
who asked not to be identified. "The floors are controlled by small cliques of 
people, and if they want to get together and distort things, there's ample 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
One of those opportunities, he said, comes in tallying up the trades at the end 
of each day. 
</P>
<P>
In the chaos of the trading pits, a buyer or a seller may not have recorded the 
trade they made together. Or the buyer and seller may have recorded trades of 
different sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Firms usually maintain an "error account," to take care of these imbalances 
without the customer suffering. Some claim that traders have improperly paid 
others to declare their personal losses as errors; such a declaration would 
mean that a firm maintaining an error account unwittingly absorbs someone 
else's loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Errors is an area where there has been a lot of abuse," said one source. "It's 
a kind of black market in errors." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those interviewed were highly critical of CFTC, saying it does not keep 
close enough watch on futures market activities and that its rules are geared 
more toward catching minor technical violations than major fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"The CFTC has been far less a factor in policing the market than the 
(Securities and Exchange Commission) has in the securities markets," said one 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that there's not as good of an audit trail as there should be," 
added Thomas A. Russo, a New York securities and commodities lawyer who was 
once a high-ranking regulator. In cases of so-called front running -- where 
traders defraud their own clients by trading for themselves before they execute 
their customers' buy and sell orders -- it is hard for CFTC to reconstruct the 
deal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The various exchanges vigorously defend their enforcement record. The Commodity 
Exchange, for example, has noted that it fines its members an average of around 
$500,000 a year as a result of its internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
CFTC also has instigated complaints over the years, generally accusing traders 
of manipulating markets or arranging bogus trades to avoid paying taxes on 
their actual gains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Past Charges 
</P>
<P>
Semel was one of 15 individuals and companies named in a civil complaint by 
CFTC in July, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He and the others were accused of a variety of violations, including make 
"fictitious sales or causing prices to be reported, registered or recorded 
which were not true and bona fide prices." 
</P>
<P>
Such transactions, the commission said, had a variety of purposes, including 
"producing losses in one fiscal year and gains in the next fiscal year" to 
reduce traders' tax bills. Also a goal, the agency said, was "cheating and 
defrauding" in trades, and executing contracts in ways that were "open and 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
All the violations were alleged to have occurred on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. 
</P>

story.

WARNER SUES TO PROTECT ITS DEAL WITH TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As time nears for the merger of Warner Communications Inc. and Time Inc., the 
two media giants made a preemptive legal move Friday to neutralize Warner's 
biggest and most dissident shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries, which has never 
publicly swung its weight behind the deal. 
</P>
<P>
With the filing of a Delaware lawsuit, Warner has effectively agreed to allow 
Chris-Craft to determine the destiny of Warner's 42.5% stake in Chris-Craft's 
BHC broadcasting subsidiary -- but it seeks the court's help in speeding a 
Chris-Craft decision. 
</P>
<P>
Chris-Craft -- which controls about 19% of Warner through its BHC subsidiary -- 
has been viewed as a potential loose cannon because its chairman and largest 
shareholder, Herbert J. Siegel, has blocked Warner moves in the past. If 
Chris-Craft is not pinned down, it might be viewed as a potential ally by any 
third party intent on breaking up the pending merger. 
</P>
<P>
No deal-spoiler has yet materialized, but Wall Street traders and analysts have 
said that a third party would be unlikely to make its move until after proxy 
materials are mailed to Warner and Time shareholders -- and the mailing is 
expected shortly. Warner Senior Vice President Geoffrey W. Holmes would not set 
a date, but noted that both companies "still expect to have shareholders' 
meetings in June." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Given Us Everything' 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, this is a sideshow to the real deal," said John Tinker, a 
securities analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. "What Warner is 
trying to do is to make sure it remains a sideshow." 
</P>
<P>
In a joint press release, Warner and Time said they still dispute Chris-Craft's 
interpretation of its BHC contract with Warner, but added, "We are willing to 
accept their interpretation in order to put this issue behind us once and for 
all." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Chris-Craft is "elated," said New York attorney Peter Fishbein. 
"They have now in effect given us everything" that Chris-Craft had been seeking 
in settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
Chris-Craft's Siegel and his advisers are expected to meet over the weekend to 
determine their next action. 
</P>
<P>
Warner said it would give up any claim of its rights of first refusal to buy 
BHC's stock in Warner and will do one of two things at Chris-Craft's bidding: 
sell its BHC stake to Chris-Craft at a fair market price or spin the shares off 
to Warner shareholders. In the latter case, BHC would become a publicly traded 
company, with Chris-Craft still functioning as the majority shareholder. BHC 
would wind up with about 11% of Time-Warner Inc. once that merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
If Warner spins off its BHC shares, Time and Warner said they have agreed to 
change the proposed ratio of their stock swap. The amount of Time stock issued 
to Warner shareholders would be reduced to .439 from .465, reflecting the fact 
that Time shareholders would no longer be getting any interest in BHC. As a 
result, the value of the deal in current stock prices would be reduced by about 
$570 million, or $3 per Warner share. 
</P>
<P>
Warner's legal move appears designed to give both sides a chance to end -- in a 
decorous way -- the sometimes-rancorous alliance forged late in 1983 when 
Chris-Craft came to Warner's rescue to fight off an unwelcome takeover bid by 
media baron Rupert Murdoch.

Pension Funds May Gang Up on Exxon: California's state employee pension fund, 
the nation's biggest, said it might back an attempt by other major Exxon Corp. 
shareholders to pressure the company to better prepare for future environmental 
disasters in the wake of its Alaskan oil spill. A spokesman for the California 
Public Employee Retirement System, which owns 8 million shares, amounting to 
about 0.6% of Exxon's outstanding common stock, said it may back New York 
City's pension plans' proposal to vote their 6 million shares of Exxon against 
company management at the May 18 annual meeting of shareholders.

Karcher Ordered to Stand Trial: Hamburger baron Carl N. Karcher has been 
ordered to stand trial June 6 on charges of insider trading, but lawyers 
indicated a settlement still might be reached. The trial date was set by U.S. 
District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles after Karcher's lawyers were 
unable to win a guarantee from the Justice Department that Karcher, founder of 
the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, would not be the target of a future criminal 
prosecution.

Preliminary OK at Bethlehem: Officials of the United Steelworkers of America 
voted to grant preliminary approval to a new contract with Pittsburgh-based 
Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's second-largest steelmaker, that would raise 
steelworkers' wages at the company 8.09%. If approved, the contract, which 
includes new profit-sharing, inflation adjustment and overtime policies, would 
be the first settlement with one of the four major steelmakers whose labor 
pacts expire July 31. The agreement also calls for wage hikes in 1991 and 1992.

Although dogs and cats comprise by far the majority of creatures with which 
county animal shelter officials must deal, they are far from the entire story. 
From the rather more commonplace to the strange, they include rabbits, birds, 
opossums, skunks, raccoons, snakes, squirrels, deer, guinea pigs, gophers, 
coyotes, ducks, rats, tortoises, moles, weasels, monkeys, wallabies, iguanas 
and ferrets. 
</P>
<P>
When a live animal shows up at an animal shelter and is not claimed by its 
owner, basically one of two fates awaits: adoption by a new owner or 
euthanasia. This last step is performed in Orange County by lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how animal adoption and euthanasia compare:

According to the Department of Justice Missing Persons Unit, during the last 
decade 121 children (less than 18 years old) have disappeared in Orange County 
and have not been accounted for yet. Since 1977, 152 adults have done the same. 
Nearly all of the juveniles involved are, for now, classified as runaways. As 
for the adults, most are considered "voluntary disappeared" -- meaning they did 
so by their own choice (adults are not classified as "runaways"). Here's the 
trend for both adults and juveniles, and the circumstances accorded their 
disappearances:

HERE ARE BOOKS YOU CAN JUDGE BY THEIR COVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDOLPH HEARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has your neighbor ever shown you his treasured collection of 2,000 matchbooks? 
Does your brother-in-law have a hoard of vintage girlie ties from the 1940s or 
garishly patterned Hawaiian shirts that he wears on those truly special 
occasions? Are your friends into maniacally collecting cow-related objects or 
whimsical salt-and-pepper shakers? 
</P>
<P>
All of these collectible aspects of Americana, as well as the venerable sports 
of bowling and miniature golf, are captured for posterity in a handsomely 
designed series of books from Abbeville Press. 
</P>
<P>
While the series is more celebratory than scholarly, it is the books' covers 
that initially grab your eye. "The Hawaiian Shirt: Its Art and History" was 
first published bound in 11 different Hawaiian shirt fabrics. Now in its third 
printing, the book offers a selection of four different fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Holes in Bowling Cover 
</P>
<P>
"Bowl-O-Rama: The Visual Arts of Bowling" has three holes bored in the cover, a 
perfect fit for the more literary-minded bowling fanatic. "Miniature Golf" 
sports a lush, green Astroturf-like fabric on its cover -- lay it down on the 
floor and do some practice putting. A touchable, pink furry udder embellishes 
the bovine chomping contentedly on the front of "Wholly Cow," a book about, 
well, cow imagery in American culture. "Close Cover Before Striking: The Golden 
Age of Matchbook Art" looks like a giant, somewhat worn matchbook. Open the 
book and the second page reveals a row of 6-inch-long matches. 
</P>
<P>
The other two entries in the series -- "Vintage Ties of the Forties &amp; 
Fifties" and "Great Shakes: Salt and Pepper for All Tastes" -- feature a 
multitude of their whimsical subjects on their covers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hawaiian Shirt" book by H. Thomas Steele started the whole series off in 
1984. "When I was 16," Steele says, "I worked in a vintage-clothing store and I 
noticed the wide variety of patterns in the Hawaiian shirts that came through, 
and started photographing them." Eventually, Steele decided to put together a 
book of his and other people's collections. It took him five years to get it 
all together and another five years to sell it, which was partly due to his 
insistence that his "labor of love" be published in full color. 
</P>
<P>
Walton Rawls, Abbeville Press senior editor, recalls: "It was a risky idea at 
the time. Our sales people were against it, but the book sold out almost 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Abbeville then published "Great Shakes" by Gideon Bosker, which is a visual 
treasure house of salt-and-pepper shakers whose designs cleverly exploit the 
idea of paired objects. Seemingly every possible combination -- from Laurel and 
Hardy, a dog and a fire hydrant, Humpty Dumpty and his wall, to an aspirin and 
a martini -- are shown. "All of these collectors are known to each other," 
Rawls explained, "and once we start a book, the alarm goes out over the 
grapevine. Somebody calls up with, 'Gee, I hope you're not going to do a book 
without my so-and-so piece.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Every Aspect Documented 
</P>
<P>
The next book published, "Bowl-O-Rama," also was written by Steele. Every 
possible aspect of bowling is visually documented, including trophies, shirts, 
patches, balls, graphics and architecture -- conjuring up an almost-vanished 
part of American culture. Half of the material in the book is from the Bowling 
Museum Hall of Fame in St. Louis. "I saw bowling alleys getting torn down all 
over the place, and I thought it had to be catalogued or the next generation 
wouldn't know what it was all about," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
"Close Cover" by Steele, Jim Heimann and Rod Dyer, delves into the crudely 
printed but imaginatively designed world of matchbook art, which fell into 
decline after the introduction of the lighter. Particularly striking are the 
novelty matchbooks that were printed with an image (for example, a row of palm 
trees against a mountainous skyline) on each individual match. As the book 
comments, these could be so attractive, they were frequently saved in an unused 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
For a younger generation accustomed to more subdued neckwear, "Vintage Ties" is 
definitely a "I can't believe people actually wore that stuff" book. A poem 
from a 1946 Kiwanis Club newsletter, reprinted in the text, reads: "The books I 
read and the life I lead/ are sensible, sane and mild./ I like calm hats and I 
don't wear spats,/ but I want my neckties wild!" 
</P>
<P>
And wild they are. Ranging from eye-zapping and sometimes downright ugly 
abstract designs to neckwear with '40s-style pinup girls cleverly hidden in the 
folds, the ties collected in this book were not for the timid. Who could 
possibly have worn a tie featuring a glass-beaded and sequin-encrusted horse's 
head with a halter made out of gold braid? Would they still admit to it today? 
</P>
<P>
"Miniature Golf" by John Margolies continued the series. Esquire magazine 
called it "the definitive pictorial history of the game," although there 
probably are not too many, if any, other books devoted to this curious and 
uniquely American sport. 
</P>
<P>
From its origins as "the very last of the goofy fads of the '20s" to its 
full-fledged flowering in the '50s, this book covers it all. Full-cover 
photographs capture a wide variety of imaginative hazards from all over the 
country -- Easter Island heads in Key West, Fla.; a family of gorillas fiercely 
guarding a hole in Atlantic Beach, N.C.; a pink storybook castle located in 
Fountain Valley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
People who hate cows should at all costs stay away from "Wholly Cow," by Emily 
Gwathmey, as every page has at least one blank-faced bovine portrayed in 
ceramic, woodcut, oil, papier-mache and other media. 
</P>
<P>
Cow-fanciers, on the other hand, will find udder delight in this celebration of 
the "nurturing cow in all her statuesque beauty (who) somehow seems the 
ultimate foster mother to the human race." Walt Whitman, Frank Lloyd Wright, D. 
H. Lawrence, Theodore Roethke, Paul Bowles and other not-so-famous boviniacs 
all wax poetic in their tributes to what is, after all, only a cow. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we publish a book," senior editor Rawls said, "we get a lot of 
submissions for ideas for books that are very similar to what we just did. We 
try, however, to do a different kind of thing with each book, instead of 
repeating ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Two new offerings are scheduled to arrive this month. "Cracker Jack Prizes" 
will document for posterity all of those eagerly awaited goodies that lay 
hidden at the bottom of a box of caramel-covered popcorn. The cover of the book 
will feature a movable picture of the Cracker Jack sailor boy and his dog. 
</P>
<P>
Steele's fourth book for Abbeville, "Lick 'Em, Stick 'Em: The Art of the Poster 
Stamp," will unearth the lost history of an unusual predecessor to matchbook 
advertising. Poster stamps were large, ornately designed non-revenue stamps 
that businesses used to promote themselves in the days before color 
advertisements in magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Abbeville Press will be promoting itself and the book by including in each copy 
a glassine envelope containing real poster stamps especially designed for "Lick 
'Em, Stick 'Em." 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming books include one on snow globes ("You know, you shake them up and 
down"), eyeglasses of the 1950s ("We have 3-D glasses, sunglasses and one pair 
in the shape of the word ZOOM"), ephemera from the Golden Age of travel 
(1880-1939), and "a book about ugly lamps." Rawls hastened to correct himself: 
"Let's not say that -- the book is actually called 'Turned-On: American 
Decorative Lamps of the 1950s.' "

ETHNIC DANCES, MUSIC PROMISE A LIVELY DAY AT THE 17TH ANNUAL FOLK FESTIVAL AT 
UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE Z. COOKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers digging for their cultural roots in foreign countries this summer can 
expect, among other tourist fare, various encounters with "real" ethnic folk 
dancing and music. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are -- TV and radio having done their homogenizing work -- the seekers 
will be served a generous portion of canned choreography, squeaky-clean and 
videotapeable. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more fortunate stay-at-homes can enjoy the genuine article Sunday at 
Music-and-Dance-on-the-Grass, the 17th annual international folk festival 
sponsored by the Associates of Ethnic Arts at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Bright costumes, elaborate headdresses, ancient folk instruments and fancy 
footwork will hold sway from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Sunset Canyon Recreation 
Center on the UCLA campus in Westwood. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
Festival organizers expect about 6,000 visitors, many of whom have attended the 
festival in years past. According to UCLA Coordinator Jorge Estrada, the first 
50 spectators to walk through the gate will receive a free ethnic-music 
recording from A&amp;M Records. 
</P>
<P>
The rest may feel just as lucky: With the sun shining and spring breezes 
blowing (in 16 years the festival has been rained out just once), the events 
take place on three stages on the grass and in the recreation center, the wide 
variety of ethnic music and dance reflecting Los Angeles' growing cultural 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pursuit of Authenticity 
</P>
<P>
Just what is "genuine" ethnic folk dancing? Answers vary, but it may be easier 
to say what it's not. For starters, it's not dance performed solely to 
entertain tourists; not traditional forms altered to suit modern tastes; not 
dance offered mainly to promote a product. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the performers at Music-and-Dance-on-the-Grass -- some UCLA study 
groups composed of teachers and students and about 20 professional troupes -- 
are single-minded in their pursuit of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
The festival -- what Sophia Poster, president of Associates of Ethnic Arts, 
calls "our gift to the community" -- is a worldwide panorama of traditional 
dance and music painstakingly researched in the countries of origin, accurately 
recorded on tape, film and paper, and, finally, lovingly performed by artists 
who've made dance their lifework. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are almost monomaniacal," KPFK announcer Mario Casetta said, 
describing some of the troupes and their directors. Casetta, host of a 
twice-weekly ethnic-music program airing Mondays and Wednesdays at 9:30 a.m., 
will be master of ceremonies in the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
A day at the festival is "like having a cultural trip around the globe," he 
explained. "You'll see dances that you'd be hard put to see two or three of in 
an entire year," he said, "but to see them all in one day, and in one location, 
is really mind-blowing. 
</P>
<P>
"People should be encouraged to bring children," he added. "Children don't get 
much of a chance to see beautiful things from other cultures and other 
peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Why does dance inspire such devotion, such "passion," as Sophia Poster calls 
it? Anyone who's ever rocked at a disco or swayed to Glenn Miller knows the 
answer. When all the scholarly words have been consigned to thick textbooks, 
what's left is man's most basic expression of emotion -- and just plain fun. 
</P>
<P>
"Dance is a primitive, hypnotic experience that arouses joy in people," said 
Poster, 70, explaining that she devotes at least two nights a week to Balkan 
dances -- a region including Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. 
Balkan circle dances are especially appealing because the dancers don't need a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sense of Communion' 
</P>
<P>
"When you dance in a circle holding hands," she said, "there's a sense of 
communion. Also, it's an informal dance structure, so you can step out and rest 
for a while, then come back in and dance some more." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she said, "there are probably more people doing Balkan dancing in Los 
Angeles than there are in the Balkans." The reason? Poster thinks many 
countries are more interested in modernizing than in preserving traditional 
culture. In Los Angeles, however, minority ethnic groups are eager to preserve 
their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
So you won't miss your favorite ethnic group, get a program at the information 
desk, near the entrance where the shuttle bus leaves its passengers. 
Information to the parking areas will be provided by staff manning the campus 
kiosks, such as the one at the entrance to the campus on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Each group is scheduled to perform for 30 to 40 minutes in one of three 
locations: the 1,000-seat outdoor amphitheater, the Buenos Ayres Room or the 
Upper Meadow. Also in the Upper Meadow, half a dozen groups will lead 
"participation" dances, encouraging onlookers to join in and teaching them the 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people flow freely from one area to another, stopping to buy and eat 
ethnic food, dancing or watching, or just sitting on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexico to Egypt 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for the amphitheater are 13 groups from such disparate cultures as 
Mexico, Japan, the Middle East, Greece, Polynesia, India, Hungary, the Andes 
Mountains region (Bolivia and Peru), China and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Seven groups will perform in the Buenos Ayres Room (Associates board member 
Carolyn Brent emceeing), including the Ebony Choraliers, traditional American 
spiritual singers. 
</P>
<P>
Ten groups are scheduled to dance on the grass in the Upper Meadow, introduced 
by Maidie Taylor, a dancer and ethnomusicologist at UCLA. Persia, Kurdistan, 
West Africa, Bali, Scotland, El Salvador and Nigeria are among regions 
represented. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most exciting professional troupes is Ote'a, a Polynesian troupe of 
20 women and 10 men, both dancers and musicians. Jack Kinner, the troupe's 
director, said his dancers, half of them of "island origin," will be performing 
Tahitian dances at 2:15 p.m. in the amphitheater, wearing what Kinner says 
"everyone calls grass skirts, but are actually made from the bark of the 
hibiscus tree." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Courtship Story 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a fishing dance, also called an ote'a, where everyone moves in 
unison to percussion instruments," he said -- in this case, wooden drums. "Also 
an aparima set, which is danced to stringed accompaniment. It's a suite of 
songs that tells a wonderful story about courtship, revelry and drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Another unusual group is the Aisha Ali Dance Company, presenting Egyptian 
dances. "Aisha Ali is unusual because her group doesn't do just belly dancing," 
Casetta said, "which is fairly common in the Middle East. She also teaches 
tribal dances from different ethnic subgroups within Egypt" and has been to 
that country many times to do research. 
</P>
<P>
"She runs out into the desert to oases, to all sorts of little villages, and 
she drags along equipment and records everything." 
</P>
<P>
Casetta is hoping that Aisha Ali will perform a Gawazee Dance, which he thinks 
is "really kitschy and fun. The Gawazee women are a group of women, almost like 
a tribe, who travel up and down the Nile on pleasure boats entertaining people. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to see their costumes to believe them -- they're not what you'd think 
of in the Middle East. They look like something out of a 1930s revue: short 
skirts, high heels and funny headdresses that look like already-folded turbans 
with spangles and little glitter things. They use ancient steps, but it looks 
like a vaudeville of the Nile." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fancy Footwork 
</P>
<P>
Casetta also recommends looking for Balkan dances, which have some of the 
fastest, fanciest footwork and often are set to unusual time signatures, like 
nine-sixteenths. Some of the women's costumes from some Balkan countries are 
sewn with gold coins, representing the women's dowries. 
</P>
<P>
The information desk also is the place to buy scrip, which you'll need to pay 
for ethnic foods being served by caterers and chefs from local restaurants. Now 
is also the time to reserve a plate of what has become the festival's most 
enduring tradition, Anthony Ivancich's Yugoslavian roast-lamb dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Ivancich marinates a whole lamb the day before, filling the cavity with green 
peppers, onions and garlic and rubbing the outside with more garlic, salt and 
pepper. Then he embeds even more garlic slivers in the meat. 
</P>
<P>
At the festival, he roasts the lamb slowly over coals for five hours on a spit 
over his family's barbecue, which he says is traded between aunts and uncles 
whenever a family gathering requires a similar traditional dinner. 
</P>
<P>
There's only so much lamb, 50 pounds being the maximum weight before lamb 
becomes mutton, so put your name on the list when you enter. Ivancich will 
serve the lamb about 2 p.m., with potatoes and green salad. If lamb isn't your 
favorite, however, there will be other ethnic food -- Greek, Indian, Japanese, 
Mexican and Ethiopian. 
</P>
<P>
Festival admission is free. Parking is $3 (there's almost no street parking) at 
UCLA parking structures 3, 4 and 5. Free shuttle buses run to Sunset Canyon 
Recreation Center.

NEW PLANTS TO DEBUT AT ARBORETUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"This is the granddaddy of plant sales," promises Francis Ching, director of 
the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
He is referring to the 19th annual Baldwin Bonanza at the Arcadia facility, 
where new and unusual plants will be sold Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We specialize in things that the nurseries don't sell," Ching says. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, the staghorn fern, with its antler-shaped fronds. About a 
dozen varieties not available in commercial nurseries are propagated in steamy 
greenhouses at the arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
For this year's sale, though, the emphasis is on food and water: consumption of 
the first, and conservation of the second. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gardening Chance 
</P>
<P>
Citrus, artichokes, 12 kinds of tomatoes, avocados, squash, figs, cucumbers, 
herbs, beans and watermelon will be among the edible plants on sale. While some 
have been field-tested at the arboretum, others have not -- and home gardeners 
willing to take a chance on untested varieties will find them at bargain 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Also for sale will be papaya "Babaco," one of the few papayas that will produce 
in the Los Angeles area despite the smog and winter cold. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with its 25,000-square-foot water-conserving garden, dedicated 
last September, the arboretum will sell a wide range of plants that can live 
and bloom in a garden with little more than rainfall to sustain them. Yarrow, 
rockrose, scarlet paintbrush, blue hibiscus, rosemary, sage, oleander and 
California fuchsia are some of the hundreds that will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
New at this year's sale are four plants recently introduced to nurseries after 
field tests at the arboretum. "Royalty" is a shrubby, spring-blooming variety 
of the bauhinia tree that produces reddish-purple, orchidlike flowers. The 
summer-flowering vines of the lemur creeper will flourish on sunny walls. A 
sturdy Australian tea tree, "Horizontalis," will crowd out weeds and will grow 
up to 6 feet tall and 10 feet wide. The "Mountain" bottlebrush, with its bright 
red flowers, will join other bottlebrushes that come in a variety of colors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plant Introductions 
</P>
<P>
Getting new plant species out of the lab and into home gardens is the 
arboretum's specialty. Over the past 30 years, the arboretum has introduced in 
Southern California more than 100 plants, including the ubiquitous freeway 
daisy and the increasingly popular blue hibiscus. 
</P>
<P>
The winnowing process is long: About 1,500 new kinds of seeds are planted at 
the arboretum each year. Only about 300 of those make it out of pots and into 
the ground, where they are observed for up to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Before offering a plant to the public, Ching says, the arboretum staff wants to 
know: Will it become a nuisance? Is it a weed? Will it be poisonous and a 
danger to children and pets? 
</P>
<P>
Though it provides some specimens to botanists and collectors, the program's 
main goal is to "find new material for the Southern California landscape," 
Ching says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteers Available 
</P>
<P>
Plants that don't adapt well to local conditions -- and some that become widely 
available in commercial nurseries -- are removed to make way for newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
For those who seek new material for their home gardens, 300 volunteers will be 
on hand at the arboretum Sunday to answer questions and help load plants into 
cars. In addition, any questions that come up after buyers bring their plants 
home can be directed to the facility's horticultural hot line, open 9 to 11:30 
a.m., (818) 446-8251. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the sale, the year's major fund-raiser, go toward operation of 
the arboretum. Last year's Baldwin Bonanza netted about $40,000, said John 
Provine, arboretum superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The sale will be held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday at the arboretum, 301 N. 
Baldwin Ave., Arcadia (across from Santa Anita Race Track). Admission is $3 for 
adults, $1.50 for students and seniors, and 75 cents for children ages 5 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
A preview party will be held tonight, 5 to 7 p.m., where California Arboretum 
Foundation members and guests can enjoy wine and snacks while getting first 
dibs on plants for sale. Tickets are $7.50 for members and $12.50 for guests. 
</P>
<P>
For reservations and additional information, call (818) 447-8207.

SOUTHLAND GETS IN THE SPIRIT WITH CINCO DE MAYO EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One hundred twenty-seven years later and they're still celebrating the Mexican 
victory over the French at the Battle of Puebla and the subsequent independence 
of the country. Cinco de Mayo it's called (postponed in many areas this year to 
coincide with the weekend), and the festivities continue to proliferate. A 
sampling: 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department presents celebrations Sunday at 
many park centers. Mariachis and folkloric dancers will perform just about 
everywhere there is a festival, including one of the biggest: Lincoln Park, 
3501 Valley Blvd., where food booths, rides, games and continuous entertainment 
flavor the day 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Paxton Rec Center, 10731 Laurel Canyon Blvd., 
will feature 20 musical groups along with rides and booths, also 10 a.m. to 6 
p.m. During those same hours, Penmar Rec Center, 1341 Lake St., Venice, will 
stage a "Kings and Queens Pageant" along with ballet, games and pinatas. Among 
other centers feting the occasion will be South Park, Wilmington, Exposition, 
Gilbert Lindsay, Algin Sutton and Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
In a spirit of ecumenism, Alhambra Park, 500 N. Palm Ave., Alhambra, includes 
ethnic groups from all over in its "Festival of Neighbors," today from noon to 
10 p.m. Musicians, dancers and singers representing Africa, Scotland, Lebanon, 
China, etc. will perform; a "Native Sweet Treat Contest" and a "Native Dress 
Parade" are open to all ages. Art contests for students kindergarten through 
12th grade will be judged; pinatas, foods, crafts round out the program. 
</P>
<P>
At Monarch Quad of Los Angeles Valley College (Fulton Avenue at Burbank 
Boulevard, Van Nuys), a free concert, co-presented by the Playboy Jazz Festival 
and Keyes 4 Cars, Sunday afternoon, 1:30-5 p.m., will feature a triple bill of 
Poncho Sanchez, Wishful Thinking and 1 + One, with Patrick Rushen and Ndugu 
Chancler. 
</P>
<P>
Just north of the border, Old Town State Historic Park in San Diego promises 
its "grandest Cinco de Mayo Festival ever," with two days (today and Sunday) of 
nonstop entertainment on three stages, a dramatic reenactment of the Battle of 
Puebla in authentic regalia, an Early California fashion show, kiosks, etc. 
Call (619) 237-6770.

LAST HEARING BEGINS MONDAY; 
</P>
<P>
FINALLY, DRIVERS TO TESTIFY ABOUT O.C. TRAFFIC PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County motorists will have their first -- and perhaps last -- chance 
Monday to testify about an ambitious 20-year plan to improve traffic and manage 
growth that would be paid for partly by a half-cent sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
The final hearing on the plan and tax -- the first proposed since voters 
soundly rejected a 1-cent sales tax increase for transportation 5 years ago -- 
will be at the County Hall of Administration in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is designed to reduce traffic congestion to 1983-84 levels. The 
transportation package includes restraints on growth as well as a specific list 
of road improvement projects -- elements not in the 1984 proposal that voters 
turned down by a 2-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic congestion is the county's No. 1 problem, according to public opinion 
surveys, and emotions run high about how best to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, for example, a homeowners' group picketed the California 
Department of Transportation in an unsuccessful bid to have car-pool lanes 
opened to all vehicles. A group of rail transit advocates campaigned strongly 
against allowing commercial development on a weedy, trackless old Pacific 
Electric trolley line right-of-way in Garden Grove. And this week, a member of 
a citizens group advising county officials walked out of a meeting in protest 
of proposed bus and rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the sales-tax plan, Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) 
among them, believe the plan is "pie in the sky" and reflects "bureaucrats' 
wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle, noting the plan's heavy reliance on exclusive lanes for buses and 
car pools, said it contains "things urban designers dream about but which most 
people will never use or see." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters see no other remedy for the county's worsening traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking out my office window at traffic on the San Diego Freeway. It's 
completely stopped," said California Transportation Commission member and 
former county supervisor Bruce Nestande, now an executive with Arnel 
Development Co., in a recent interview. "Unless people support a plan like 
this, they will have to reconcile themselves to sitting in that traffic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Required by Law 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is the only urban county in California without such a tax. Under 
state law, a transportation plan must be adopted before voters can be asked to 
approve a transportation sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would generate $3.1 billion over 20 years. Proceeds would be used to 
help pay for implementing the 20-year plan. The total cost of traffic 
improvements would be would be $11.6 billion. About $1.3 billion of the sales 
tax revenue would be earmarked for freeway projects; street and transit 
projects would get $900 million each. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for much of the tax revenue to go toward speeding up the 
completion of the Santa Ana Freeway widening project, in which the number of 
lanes is being doubled from six to 12, and toward additional lanes (most for 
car pools) on the Orange, Costa Mesa, Riverside and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The street money would be used by individual cities to synchronize traffic 
signals and make road repairs and improvements. The new transit projects would 
include at least two new commuter trains on the Los Angeles-San Diego route 
through Orange County, possibly the establishment of commuter rail service 
between Riverside and Irvine. Transit money would also provide the initial 
funding for some experimental automated "people mover" systems, elevated 
light-rail systems such as the one now being considered in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent traffic from becoming worse, no city would be eligible for the tax 
revenue unless it adopted a strict growth management plan. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members will hear sharply divergent views at Monday's hearing, which 
comes after public workshops, surveys, the formation of a citizens task force 
and meetings with community organizations in an attempt to reach a public 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony is expected to include: 
</P>
<P>
* Protests from groups critical of the plan's heavy reliance on additional 
car-pool lanes. Dana W. Reed, a Costa Mesa lawyer who serves as the 
public-at-large member of the county commission, says he will resist any 
attempt to scuttle car-pool projects. "There is no way we can build enough 
lanes for everybody to ride the freeway at 55 m.p.h. during rush hour," he 
argues. "People will have to double up." 
</P>
<P>
* Suggestions from the Transportation Commission's own citizens advisory task 
force that more transit dollars be put toward commuter trains on the Los 
Angeles-San Clemente line rather than toward so-called feeder lines -- such as 
Anaheim's people mover system or Irvine's planned monorail project. "The real 
problem is that there is not enough funding to do what's in the plan, and we 
prefer a more realistic approach," says James Brooks of Irvine, a task force 
member. 
</P>
<P>
* Criticism that provisions for enforcing cities' adherence to growth controls 
in the plan are too weak, a suggestion that the members of a citizens' 
oversight panel, that has been proposed be elected rather than appointed, and a 
demand that projects be ranked by priority so that voters can see which have 
the first call on tax proceeds. "We'd like to see a project priority list 
narrowed very rapidly," says Russ Burkett of Orange County Tomorrow, a 
slow-growth group. 
</P>
<P>
Without an elected citizens' oversight panel, argues Tom Rogers of Citizens 
Against Unfair Taxation, the same people responsible for creating today's 
traffic mess will control proceeds from the transportation sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, and from possibly others, that 
the growth control provisions affecting cities are too restrictive. Young 
argues that if residents believe a city is not living up to the plan's growth 
management standards, they should take the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposals from a new group, the Foundation for Consensus in Transportation, 
to establish annual independent financial and management audits, a citizens' 
oversight committee "with substantial powers to accommodate citizen input and 
review," a consolidation of county transportation agencies, and "a financing 
mechanism to acquire additional open space and upgrade present recreational 
areas." The group is chaired by Reed L. Royalty , Pacific Bell's area vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The "financing mechanism," Royalty says, could be the $235-million open-space 
bond act proposed by Elizabeth Brown, president of Laguna Greenbelt Inc., one 
of the county's most influential environmental groups. Brown is on the 
executive committee of Royalty's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Contra Costa County approved a similar open-space bond measure (for 
$225 million) as well as a half-cent transportation sales tax last November. 
Sponsors of both measures helped each other as part of a quid pro quo. 
</P>
<P>
Some commission members said Friday that a vote on adoption of the 20-year plan 
may be postponed 2 weeks if testimony is not completed on Monday or if fine 
tuning of the document is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission staff has been preparing for a Nov. 7 special 
election. But under state law, the commission must first adopt the 20-year 
plan, and it must be ratified by a majority of the city councils representing 
most of the county's population as well as by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors have until Aug. 8 to order the printing of ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting begins at 9 a.m. in the Hearing Room of the County Hall of 
Administration in the Civic Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF HALF-CENT TAX 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the projects that the Orange County Transportation Commission 
suggests might be undertaken with passage of a half-cent tax measure: 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year earlier completion of rebuilding the Santa Ana Freeway from the Los 
Angeles County line to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding the interchange of the Santa Ana Freeway with the San Diego Freeway 
at the El Toro Y. 
</P>
<P>
Adding lanes to the San Diego Freeway in southern Orange County, the Riverside 
Freeway throughout the county, the Orange Freeway from the Los Angeles County 
line to the Santa Ana Freeway, and adding a lane to the Costa Mesa Freeway 
between the Riverside Freeway and the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Building a 220-mile network of "Super Streets" on Orange County's 21 busiest 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail service. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinating traffic signals throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring every city and the county to adopt a comprehensive growth management 
plan to link traffic relief and planned future development.

POLICE CHASE, CAPTURE SUSPECT FLEEING IN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police and sheriff's deputies chased a car thought to be stolen for several 
miles early Friday, then opened fire when the driver tried to run them down in 
a parking lot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, a 23-year-old Los Angeles man whose name was not immediately 
released, was taken to Long Beach Memorial Hospital for treatment of injuries 
suffered when the car crashed and for a possible gunshot wound, Cypress Police 
Lt. John Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect faced possible assault charges for allegedly attempting to ram 
officers with the car, which turned out not to have been stolen, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy tried to stop the driver about 2:30 a.m. 
near Atlantic and Alondra boulevards in an unincorporated area of the county 
near Compton because he believed the car was possibly stolen. The driver, who 
was alone in the car, fled with the deputy in pursuit. Compton police joined 
the chase, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase lasted more than 10 miles and ended in Cypress when the driver 
crashed in a parking lot in an industrial area. The driver then put the car 
into reverse and accelerated toward the deputy and Compton officers, who fired 
several shots. 
</P>
<P>
No officers were hurt.

UCI'S GRADUATION RATE TOPS 50% FOR FIRST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in its history, UC Irvine's graduation rate among 
undergraduates has gone over the 50% mark. 
</P>
<P>
A report from the university's office of analytical studies showed an increase 
in the 5-year graduation rate of freshmen from 44.3% for the 1978 entering 
class to 50.8% for the 1982 entering class. 
</P>
<P>
The study also recorded a decrease of 10 percentage points in the freshman 
dropout rate over the last 8 years and an increase in the rate of graduation 
for black, Latino, and American Indian students from 30.7% to 47.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Other findings in the 64-page report include higher graduation rates among 
recent entering black students but a dropout rate higher than any other group 
of regularly admitted freshman. For the Latino class entering in the fall of 
1983, there was only a 2% dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that community college transfer students have a higher 
graduation rate than 4-year college transfers.

INFORMATION SWAP LED TO ARREST OF SHOOTING SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man arrested Thursday night in the April 24 robbery and shooting of a retired 
Buena Park police captain became a suspect after robbery detectives swapped 
information at a meeting, said a Buena Park police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Richard McMillen would not give details of the information that was 
traded, but said it led to the identification of Jerry Dean Dunham, 28, of 
Anaheim as the person who twice shot and seriously wounded retired Capt. Robert 
Coovert, 57, in Coovert's florist shop in the 6000 block of Orangethorpe Avenue 
in Buena Park on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
Coovert, who was with the Buena Park Police Department 11 years before he 
retired, has undergone surgery to remove his liver and spleen and to repair 
damage to his left eye, McMillen said. Coovert remained hospitalized Friday in 
good condition at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunham is being held at the Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail on 
suspicion of armed robbery and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Coovert was shot once in the head and once in the chest in Garrick's Flowers 
after he refused to give a robber his money and his wife's purse. Coovert said 
later he "went for" the robber, thinking the man was wielding a toy gun. 
Coovert's wife, Betty, was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
The robber fled after the shooting, getting away with $50 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Coovert and his wife have operated the flower shop since 1973, when Coovert 
took a disability retirement from the Buena Park force. 
</P>
<P>
At the Anaheim motel where Dunham was arrested, neighbors said he lived alone 
and kept to himself. One neighbor, who asked that his name not be used, said 
Dunham had told him that he was an electrician.

INCINERATOR 'CLEANSES' MCCOLL SOIL; 
</P>
<P>
EPA SAYS TEST BURN DESTROYED DANGEROUS COMPOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial test run of a La Jolla experimental hazardous waste incinerator 
successfully destroyed potentially carcinogenic compounds in 
petroleum-contaminated soil from Fullerton's McColl dump, according to 
preliminary results released this week by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden Environmental Services' incinerator successfully destroyed the compounds 
from the abandoned waste dump, exceeding the required 99.99% destruction of 
certain compounds during the 4-day test that began March 27. 
</P>
<P>
"No significant levels of hazardous organic compounds left the system in the 
stack gas or remained in the bed and fly ash material," according to an EPA 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with the preliminary results," said Terry Wilson, spokesman 
for the EPA's western regional office. "They met (requirements for) everything 
or exceeded them." 
</P>
<P>
The results, while still incomplete, are a significant step forward for the 
firm, which is attempting to win a lucrative federal Superfund contract to 
incinerate all 265,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil at the 8-acre waste 
dump in the foothills of western Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sparked 2-Year Battle 
</P>
<P>
The company, whose plan to conduct the experiment in a populated section of La 
Jolla sparked a 2-year battle with environmentalists and the San Diego City 
Council, hopes to win permission to conduct a similar test burn in a mobile 
incinerator at the McColl site later this year. If successful, that test would 
allow Ogden to compete with other firms for the McColl cleanup contract. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be determined by the EPA is whether the combustion process created 
highly carcinogenic dioxins, PCBs or furans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted with it," said Robert Wilbourn, Ogden's director of operations 
and technical support. "We feel that it proves the technology. It doesn't come 
as a surprise to us." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Porras, chairwoman of a citizens group that has been lobbying for the 
cleanup of McColl for the past 10 years, was equally pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives the community a lot of hope that McColl can be cleaned up," said 
Porras, chairwoman of the McColl Community Action Group. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden and the city this week settled their 17-month legal battle over the test 
burn, when the city agreed to drop its appeal of a U.S. District Court judge's 
order allowing the March test burn. In addition, the city agreed to pay Ogden 
$1.25 million in attorneys' fees and damages for delaying the test burn. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is conditional on a federal court magistrate verifying that the 
emissions were not harmful to the public. 
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA "fact sheet," mailed this week to Ogden, Porras and others 
after the ongoing McColl cleanup, the experimental hazardous waste incinerator 
successfully destroyed a chemical tracer added to the 7,500 pounds of McColl 
waste and clean soil burned during the 31-hour test of the incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exceeded Required Level 
</P>
<P>
The incinerator, which reached temperatures as high as 1,700 degrees 
Fahrenheit, achieved a "destruction and removal efficiency" of 99.992%, 
exceeding the required 99.99% for the compound "carbon tetrachloride" inserted 
into the waste stream by evaluators. 
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the incinerator dramatically reduced the quantities of 
benzene, toluene, naphthalene and four other compounds in stack gas emissions. 
In ash trapped in the incinerator's bed and "baghouse" filter, the compounds 
were reduced to the point that they were undetectable. 
</P>
<P>
By adding limestone to the waste mix as it was burned, the process more than 
neutralized the highly acidic waste, making it possible to bury the ash left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbourn said the incinerator also succeeded in limiting emissions of nitrogen 
oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and hydrochloric acid. 
</P>
<P>
A second EPA report is due in June, with a final evaluation due in August.

<P>
GUSTAFSON OF END CAFE DIES OF CANCER AT AGE 59 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER L. CHIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Gustafson, owner of the End Cafe, a landmark at the end of Huntington 
Beach Pier that was twice destroyed by storms, has died at age 59 of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Friends remembered him as a generous, friendly, hard-working and determined 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bagshaw said that his friend and former boss often gave free cups of coffee 
and sandwiches to those who could not afford to pay and that he often hired 
foreign travelers staying at the local youth hostel who needed spending money. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson always celebrated the birthdays of his employees and regular 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Flowers, Presents 
</P>
<P>
"He never forgot anybody's birthday," Bagshaw said. "He would have a present 
for the guys, flowers for the girls and a birthday cake." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the popular End Cafe and a bait shack were left teetering at the end 
of the pier after storms ripped out 30 pilings and 500 square feet of the 
pier's deck. The cafe was demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The End Cafe was reopened in September, 1985. But a storm in January, 1988, 
ripped about 250 feet off the pier and toppled the End Cafe into the sea -- 10 
minutes after Gustafson had left the building. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson, meanwhile, had negotiated with Maxwell's, an upscale eatery at the 
front end of the pier, for a small retail space on the side of the restaurant, 
where he opened a new place. He affectionately named it Maxie's Other End Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Said Alice Gustafson, 58, of her husband's setbacks: "He never complained, 
although there was no insurance at either time. He was always positive, and he 
didn't let it get him down." 
</P>
<P>
The End Cafe was a tourist landmark. Tourists often told Gustafson and his 
employees that pilots bringing them in over Huntington Beach had pointed out 
the cafe, Bagshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Born Sept. 8, 1929, in Denver, Gustafson moved with his family to California in 
1953 and lived in Gardena and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Restaurant in '76 
</P>
<P>
But he "loved the pier and said he always wanted to own the restaurant at the 
end," Alice Gustafson said. The family moved to Huntington Beach and Gustafson 
bought the restaurant in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
He died at home Wednesday night after a 5-month struggle with lung cancer. His 
wife and mother were at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, John Gustafson Jr., 36, 
and Frank Gustafson, 33, both of Huntington Beach; three daughters, Christine 
Gustafson, 34, of Corona del Mar; Mary Beth Downey, 32, of Huntington Beach and 
Linda KinCannon, 41, of Denver; his mother, Willena Gustafson, 81, of Denver 
and five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services are pending. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that 
donations be made to the John Gustafson Memorial Fund, in care of Dilday 
Brothers Mortuary, 17911 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach, Calif. 92647.

Sophomore Kerin Dull pitched a three-hitter and drove in a run to lead Mission 
Viejo High School to a 3-0 South Coast League softball victory over Irvine 
Friday at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The victory brings Mission Viejo (14-8, 5-3) within a game of league-leading 
Irvine (15-7-1, 6-2) with two games to play. Mission Viejo has defeated Irvine 
three times this season, including a nonleague tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now in the same must-win situation that Mission Viejo was in today," 
said Irvine Coach Phil Dunmeyer, whose team was ranked fifth in the Southern 
Section 3-A. "We have to win both games next week if we are to avoid the 
possibility of being tied for the title, but I feel confident because the kids 
have played well when we've had to this season." 
</P>
<P>
Dull, who came within one out of pitching a perfect game last week against Dana 
Hills, didn't allow a hit until the fourth, when Dunmeyer's daughter, freshman 
first baseman Cheryl, beat out an infield grounder. Dunmeyer, one of nine 
underclassmen starters for Irvine (five sophomores and four freshmen), had two 
hits. Sophomore pitcher Jennifer Brundage (14-7) had the other Irvine hit. 
</P>
<P>
Brundage, who retired nine in a row after Renee Pina reached first when 
Dunmeyer dropped second baseman Karissa Meith's throw in the first inning, gave 
up her first hit in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Bond started the inning with a single to right. Bond, who will attend UC 
Santa Barbara in the fall, advanced to second on catcher Lisa Goodwin's passed 
ball and scored two outs later on Dull's single. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo scored twice in the sixth on two errors and an infield hit. 
</P>
<P>
In another South Coast League game: 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente 6, Dana Hills 1 -- Host San Clemente broke through with a six-run 
sixth inning. San Clemente (10-11, 4-4) had three hits and took advantage of 
four errors in the inning. Dana Hills is 2-6 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sea View League: 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 2, Saddleback 1 (12 innings) -- Saddleback couldn't make a play on a 
chopper hit by Tustin's Melissa Mazanet and Laura Teal scored from third for 
the winning run in the bottom of the 12th. Tustin and Saddleback are each 11-2 
in league play. Tustin is 14-7 overall; Saddleback is 23-4. 
</P>
<P>
University 4, Newport Harbor 2 -- Lakita Johnson hit a three-run homer in the 
top of the sixth to give University a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sunset League: 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 8, Westminster 2 -- Shannon Dolan had two hits, including a 
home run, and two RBIs for Fountain Valley (17-5-1, 6-2) at Westminster. Janet 
Miyhara (10-2) pitched a three-hitter, striking out 11, for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 2, Ocean View 0 -- Shane Bradley scored one run and knocked in 
the other for host Huntington Beach (13-11, 5-3). April Crosby's infield single 
scored Bradley in the fourth and Dana Jahr scored on a fielder's choice by 
Bradley in the sixth. Pam Fogg (9-6) pitched her seventh shutout, a 
five-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Marina 7, Edison 0 -- Willa Parchen (14-7) pitched a three-hitter, striking out 
nine, for the Vikings at Marina.

JOE WILLIAMS IS SINGING THOSE BLUES, BUT USUALLY ON AN OPTIMISTIC NOTE 
</P>

Memphis Slim wrote it. But the song "Everyday I Have the Blues" has been Joe 
Williams' since fans at Chicago's long-gone Club DeLisa began requesting it 
from the brassy-toned vocalist about 40 years ago. So how does he keep it 
sounding fresh after all these years? 
</P>
<P>
"It's the treatment," he answered in a phone conversation from his Las Vegas 
home earlier this week. "I'm with Miles Davis on this. I think the treatment of 
a song is the thing that interests me more than anything else. Like Frank 
Sinatra, who gives such marvelous treatments, his arrangements are good, the 
orchestrations are super . . . you can just feel the music." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on his most recent release, "Every Night" (Verve), recorded live at 
L.A.'s Vine St. Bar and Grill, Williams brings new life to his theme song by 
singing it over an arrangement of Miles' "All Blues." The resulting blend is a 
sweet counterpoint of moods. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who will be appearing Sunday on a double bill with Nancy Wilson at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, has an upbeat way with even the most 
down-and-out lyric. There's no self pity in his style. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I started to sing 'Every Day,' I was coming out of a period in my 
life where I was at a very low ebb and literally felt that nobody understood me 
and nobody cared about me," he said, paraphrasing one of the tune's lines. 
</P>
<P>
"But that brought out another attitude. You realize that every tub sits on its 
own bottom, everybody has his own thing to do, and they don't really have the 
time to worry about you. So you go straight ahead. You have to get definitive 
about how to handle the fact that 'nobody loves me, nobody seems to care.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult not to love Williams. His physical and vocal presence commands 
attention whether he appears in intimate clubs or in large venues such as the 
Hollywood Bowl. A big man with a big sound, he has a spirited, good-natured way 
with standards and ballads as well as the blues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think blues singing is always 'I'm beaten down, poor and hurting, I'm 
in pain, my woman left me.' Because then in the next breath you're singing a 
bluesy tune called 'I Had Someone Before I Had You and I'll Have Somebody After 
You're Gone,' which is a happy blues, a very happy blues." 
</P>
<P>
Williams began sitting in with Chicago bands when he was 16 and spent time with 
Coleman Hawkins, Andy Kirk and Lionel Hampton before his historic first tour 
with Count Basie in 1950. The orchestra leader made Williams a star, dubbing 
him his "number one son" and later helping him establish a career of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' respect for Basie is apparent when the name is brought up. "He was a 
quiet man, a very quiet man," Williams recalls. "He gave everybody in the 
organization the space to contribute and was willing to have that contribution 
become part of the overall repertoire. That's one of the reasons so many 
musicians came up through him and went on to greater success." 
</P>
<P>
At 70, Williams stays busy. He recently toured Japan and the East Coast and 
will be performing throughout Europe and Japan this summer. A new album, to be 
released this month, features two numbers each with Shirley Horn, Marlena Shaw 
and Supersax. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this his ongoing role as Claire Huxtable's father on "The Cosby Show" 
and the poor guy has little time for one of his true loves -- golf -- though he 
plans to play in this year's Bing Crosby Tournament in Winston Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
But he makes sure he has time for another of his passions: "Days of Our Lives." 
</P>
<P>
"That's life and death," according to Jillean, his wife of 24 years. "Our whole 
day revolves around it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite years of this hectic pace, Williams' voice is still radiant and strong. 
"When you have the instrument," he said, "you've got to use it judiciously, to 
take care of it the best you can -- without isolating yourself completely from 
fun and living." 
</P>
<P>
Though there is a lack of commercial exposure for his kind of music, Williams 
is optimistic for its future. "We've always had an audience and always will," 
he said. "The music that we do has always been for a more sophisticated group, 
as opposed to the masses. The audience grows to us; we don't have to change. 
Kids, when they're 15 or 16 years old, listen to one thing. As they get older, 
their tastes change. They'll come to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Williams and Nancy Wilson sing Sunday at 8 p.m. at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 to $28. 
Information: (714) 556-2787.

PLUCKING FISH FROM A DANGEROUS OCEAN IN A SMALL BOAT: 'THIS, IT'S NOT EASY, YOU 
KNOW?' SAYS ONE WHO DOES IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Onshore, the bright orange morning sun has just begun to show behind the towers 
of Newport Center, nearly 4 miles to the north, as Nick D'Amato falls into a 
relentless, flailing working rhythm aboard his tiny boat. 
</P>
<P>
He exhales sharply and his features pinch as he jerks fish after thrashing fish 
from the rising line with his gloved right hand and flings them into the stern 
of his boat with his ungloved left. The winch pulling up the line grinds on and 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Every minute or so, two or three hooks in succession come up empty, giving 
D'Amato a few seconds to sag back against the gunwale and make the most 
unnecessary pronouncement of the day: 
</P>
<P>
"This, it's not easy, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
Hauling several hundred pounds of fish out of the channel that separates 
Catalina from the mainland and into a boat only 18 feet long -- and doing it 
nearly every day -- may qualify as one of the least easy jobs in Orange County. 
In fact, from an outsider's perspective, it looks to be slightly less cushy 
than dismantling unexploded bombs. 
</P>
<P>
But for 14 years, it has been D'Amato's bread and butter. During that time, he 
and his little boat have motored out into the channel in fair and foul weather, 
often working in darkness and fog and wet cold, in high waves and cutting winds 
and through hours of lonely, muscle-straining work. 
</P>
<P>
Still, D'Amato said, it would have been unusual if he had not turned to the 
fisherman's life when he arrived in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in the Sicilian town of Porticello, near Palermo, D'Amato, 42, 
said that when he came to live in Costa Mesa with his American-born wife, 
Julie, in 1974, he worked for a time for a local electronics company assembling 
computer boards. Then he discovered the dory fleet and his heritage was 
revived. His family, he said, has produced fishermen for many generations -- 
"all of them, all the way back." 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw they were fishing here, I said, 'That's what I do. That's my job.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
And with that, he began his tenure as a doryman, giving up late sleeping, 
certain income, safe working conditions and unscored hands. 
</P>
<P>
Abstractly, D'Amato's job is simple. He catches fish and sells them. No time 
clock, no bosses, no one telling him how to run his business. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, however, D'Amato and his fellow dorymen must obey two of the 
grimmest taskmasters known -- nature and public demand. 
</P>
<P>
Some days, the waves are too high, or the fish won't bite, or they catch fish 
that won't sell. And even if they have a good day, maybe the customers will 
stay home and opt for chicken, or they may not want the kind of fish caught 
that day, or they may not feel like coming out in the wind and the spray and 
the cold, gray weather, even if the dorymen did. 
</P>
<P>
But early in the morning, in the dark, when most people have been asleep for 
only 3 or 4 hours, D'Amato tows his dory, painted with the Italian tricolor 
stripes, down to the surf near the Newport Pier to begin another day. 
</P>
<P>
Dory fishermen have been performing that ritual in Newport Beach since 1891, 
when a Portuguese fisherman began selling fish at the beach out of his dory, 
rather than having them hauled to market. The only substantial difference over 
the nearly 100 years is that oars have been traded for powerful outboard motors 
on the boats. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 16 fishermen in the dory fleet, and they are likely unique 
in California. Don Schultze, a marine resources supervisor for the state Fish 
and Game Department, which licenses the dory fleet, said: "I don't believe 
there's a comparable fleet elsewhere in the state. It's a pretty unique 
operation, launching directly off the beach like that." 
</P>
<P>
On this day, D'Amato's lines have been set only about 3 miles off the Newport 
Beach shore, and it takes less than 10 minutes to motor out to the marker buoy 
he has left the day before. (Depending on the season and where the best fish 
can be found, the dory men sometimes venture 20 miles out to sea.) However, he 
must first launch his craft and drive it through the shore break at the pier. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, the waves are slight, but D'Amato said larger ones do not keep 
him and his colleagues from their business. Ask about them, though, and you get 
a quick shake of the head and a groan. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty big," he says. 
</P>
<P>
His flat-bottomed dory is a quick boat in the calm water, making an estimated 
22 knots. D'Amato stands holding the wheel, steering into the gentle oncoming 
swells, immobile, as if he has been nailed fast to the deck. He wears a knitted 
cap to keep the wind off but keeps his face into the spray. 
</P>
<P>
His hands are so cracked and calloused from years of handling lines and knives 
and gaffs and fish that a hook wouldn't dare to try to lodge in them. Several 
hours of exposure to cold and sea water can soften them and turn them raw, 
however. The palms and fingertips will soon turn nearly ivory white, especially 
those on the ungloved left hand. 
</P>
<P>
Today, D'Amato must retrieve only two lines and one unbaited anchor line (other 
days, he said, he often sets more). But each line, he said, is about a mile 
long and is set with about 600 hooks. Also, at intervals along the line are 
tied both empty glass bottles and half bricks, in order to keep the line 
relatively stationary in the depths. At today's spot, the lines are trailing 
down into about 1,100 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
To raise the line, a hydraulic winch is used, powered by an inboard gas engine. 
D'Amato stands next to the winch as the line feeds through it, controlling its 
speed with a short handle. He rarely touches the handle, however, preferring to 
pluck the fish from the line as they rise to the winch; the line is allowed to 
trail into a plastic bucket. As the bricks and bottles appear, he quickly 
unties them or, if the knot will not yield, grabs a nearby knife and cuts them 
free of the line, tossing them into buckets for use the next day. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 2 hours, D'Amato's gaze is focused not on the spectacular dawn or 
the lovely, glassy sea or the gulls wheeling overhead, but over the starboard 
side of his boat, about 10 feet below the surface of the green water, where the 
fish on the line are beginning to appear from the depths. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this, look at this," he says, beckoning. "Come here, you got to be 
quick." A large red snapper, perhaps 3 feet long, is coming up. For this prize, 
D'Amato stops the winch, wrestles the fish off the hook and deposits it in the 
place of honor, on a thwart next to the inboard engine. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the morning, most of his catch turns out to be sea trout, with 
a smaller haul of red snapper. As the catch changes, so does his mood. 
</P>
<P>
"Another whitey," he grumbles as he slings another haddock into the boat. "The 
people don't buy as many of them. They want the red snapper." 
</P>
<P>
And there are periods when hook after hook rises with the bait nibbled or 
snatched away cleanly, or with the remains of a fish that has taken the bait 
only to be mostly eaten or mauled by a still-larger fish. D'Amato holds up one 
sea trout that has been almost cleanly bitten in two, nods at a pair of sea 
lions feeding nearby and shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what they do. A lot of people out here don't like them. They're good 
animals, and I would never kill one, but sometimes I feel like they cheat me." 
</P>
<P>
Things look up, however, a few minutes later when the second line brings up a 
steady stream of sea trout. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the entire available bottom of the boat, along with two plastic tubs, 
is piled ankle-deep with fish, and D'Amato turns the dory for home. The laden 
boat moves more sluggishly this time. It is about 8:15 a.m. Reaching the shore 
break in front of the dory fleet's beach, he guns the motor at the crest of a 
wave and rides it smoothly in, the boat scraping to a stop in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
His son, Onofrio, 17, arrives quickly with the trailer -- not to pull the boat 
onto shore, but to cart tub after heavy tub of fresh fish a few yards up the 
beach to the D'Amato family fish stall where, beneath Perrier and Cinzano 
umbrellas, customers wait. The stall, as well as other dorymen's stalls, opens 
for business immediately after the boat returns. 
</P>
<P>
While D'Amato weighs the fish and talks with customers, Onofrio cleans the fish 
at an adjacent cutting board with a flashing knife, turning whole fish into 
table-ready fillets in seconds. His wife wraps them in butcher paper and 
newsprint. The selling will go on into the late afternoon, when the other two 
D'Amato children, Veronica, 15, and Giacomo, 11, often arrive to help wrap fish 
and attach anchovy bait to the lines to be set for the next day's catch. 
</P>
<P>
The haul this day, Onofrio said, is better than average, perhaps 1,000 pounds 
of fish. Those that the family does not sell to oceanside customers will be 
offered wholesale to restaurants and markets. 
</P>
<P>
Income, D'Amato said, is never dependable, and, because competition between 
them is keen, he and other dorymen are reluctant to discuss it. What with boat 
repairs, the price of bait and other continuing overhead costs, there are lean 
times as well as relatively prosperous ones. A good catch, he said, can be 
followed by several bad ones, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
After years of fishing in both Sicily and California, D'Amato has no romantic 
illusions about his work. He says he believes that the labor has aged him 
beyond his years. He does not want or expect to fish into his later years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the family tradition is not likely to end when he hangs up his knit 
hat for the last time. Onofrio remains excited about the life. 
</P>
<P>
"Onofrio would go out with him when he was about 7 years old," said Julie 
D'Amato. "A couple of years ago, he started going out with him all the time. 
Six months ago, he started going by himself." 
</P>
<P>
Today, D'Amato and his son will sometimes spell each other, one setting the 
lines, the other returning later to haul in the fish. It is a schedule that 
requires special accommodations for the high school-age Onofrio. He attends 
Back Bay High School in Newport Beach and is enrolled in a program that allows 
him to attend class once a week, at which time a week's worth of homework will 
be assigned for him to complete after working hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I like fishing," he said. "I've liked it since I was real young. It's a real 
challenge to see how much fish you can actually get under all conditions." 
</P>
<P>
He has had close calls in his young career. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah, plenty in bad weather," he said. "It's scary. Sometimes, you wonder 
if you can make it in. The winds get so strong and the swells get so big. But 
you feel like you've accomplished something; that's for sure." 
</P>

ON THE WATERFRONT: LOVELY SITE TO STUDY THE LOWLY SEA URCHIN 
</P>

<P>
Don't be fooled by the glamorous facade of the Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory, the 
1920s-era building complete with castle-like tower that sits in China Cove, 
near the entrance to Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the building looks like the biology lab that it is, complete with 
cluttered desks, high-tech microscopes and windowless research rooms, where the 
the million-dollar ocean view goes begging. 
</P>
<P>
The Kerckhoff lab, directly across from the Newport jetty, amid stylish homes 
and a high-rise apartment building, has been part of Caltech's biology 
department since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
If you have ever gone in or out of Newport Harbor by boat, you have probably 
seen the landmark building, its unwieldy name emblazoned across its face: 
"William G. Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory -- California Institute." 
</P>
<P>
The lab is used primarily for research in molecular and cellular biology, using 
marine animals -- mostly sea urchins, 2,000 to 3,000 of which are kept alive in 
aquariums filled with piped-in seawater. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen Caltech researchers, in three different groups, work at the lab, 
according to Charles Brokaw, a professor there since 1952. Brokaw points out 
that most research now being conducted at the Kerckhoff lab is not directly 
related to marine biology, as it was in years past. 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw's research involves using sea urchins to study the motility of sperm, 
while a second research group uses sea urchins to study genetics and the early 
development of animals. "We chose the sea urchin because it is a convenient 
animal to use and relates in general to all other animals," Brokaw explained. 
</P>
<P>
Only the third research group, under the direction of Wheeler North, is 
involved in the study of the marine environment, according to Brokaw. North's 
group studies kelp and North himself is internationally known for his research 
on California's giant kelp beds. One aspect of North's work is the interaction 
between kelp beds and sea urchins, which feed off the beds. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally others (from Caltech) come down and visit or work in association 
with these three groups," Brokaw says. "But this is strictly a research 
facility. It's a branch lab of the biology department. A fair amount (of the 
laboratory space) is used as aquarium space to maintain the sea urchins." 
</P>
<P>
The lab is set up to duplicate -- as closely as possible -- the natural habitat 
of the sea urchin, according to Brokaw, and its waterfront location is 
essential to its operation. "We can collect animals in their natural 
environment at the time of year that they are full of eggs and spermatozoa. And 
we can use them any time during the year" by keeping them alive in the lab's 
aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of being located here is that we have a seawater system for 
maintaining sea urchins, on a year-round basis, to keep them in a healthy 
state," he says. "We can take them through life cycles here. That requires a 
regular, continuous supply of seawater." 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory also has its own dock and fleet, including a 31-foot powerboat 
and several small dinghies. Divers from the laboratory use the boats to collect 
sea urchins, according to Brokaw, who first came to the lab as an undergraduate 
in the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, the lab was not being used as much as it is today, Brokaw recalls. 
"One reason was because it was not in very good condition." 
</P>
<P>
The original building had never been designed as a laboratory but was built in 
1926 by the Balboa Pacific Palisades Club as a bath and boathouse. "It was to 
be a private club," Brokaw says. "But it was never completed." 
</P>
<P>
Caltech purchased the building in 1929 with money donated by William G. 
Kerckhoff, head of Southern California Gas Co., and turned it into a scientific 
facility. From 1932 to 1957, the laboratory was involved mostly in marine 
biology and was run by George MacGinitie, who used it to study the feeding 
mechanisms of marine animals, according to Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
MacGinitie, who recently celebrated his 100th birthday, is a Caltech emeritus 
professor and the author of "The Natural History of Marine Animals." 
</P>
<P>
After MacGinitie's retirement in 1957, there was little activity at the lab, 
Brokaw said. But in 1965, the building underwent a major renovation in which it 
was "for the first time designed as a laboratory," Brokaw says. "We also added 
a parking lot and four apartments for people working here temporarily." 
Activity at the lab increased during the '70s, and today, there is year-round 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Working in a spectacular beachfront location has its advantages, admits Brokaw, 
who moved to Orange County in 1963. "But being located in such a remote lab is 
sometimes difficult."

JOSEPH N. BELL: MOVIE SEEMS TO SIGNAL THAT MOST OF US YEARN FOR A CHANCE TO 
DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we got home from a late evening out recently, we found a note in our front 
door and, with it, a $20 bill. It was from a neighbor friend who would be 
embarrassed if I used his name. That kind of generosity doesn't seek 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The note said that he and his family had just seen the movie "Field of Dreams," 
and he wanted us to see it so badly that he would pop for the admission. 
"Please go," he wrote, and he signed the note, "One who still dreams." 
</P>
<P>
We went on a Monday night. We had tried to go earlier but the line extended for 
several blocks, so we gave up. There was a line on Monday, too, but it was 
shorter so we stuck it out. And our friend was right. 
</P>
<P>
"Field of Dreams" is about a young Iowa farmer who is frightened that he will 
live his life out as his father did -- without dreams and, finally, without 
hope. So when a dream is thrust before him, he follows it, even though it seems 
wrong-headed and absurd to the practical people in his community. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written about the movie, and I don't intend to add to that here. 
What fascinated me as I came out of the theater was not so much the message of 
the film as the message of the people who are lining up to see it. They are 
saying -- it seems to me -- loud and clear: "We want to dream, too. And just 
give us half a chance, and we will." 
</P>
<P>
These are people who live daily with public officials who cheat and lie, with 
random killings, with shrill and clamoring pressure groups, with violence to 
mind and body and soul, with a national pragmatism that says, "Get yours before 
somebody else gets you." The ultimate dream in that society, I suppose, is the 
$10-million lottery ticket -- the only dream left to many of our poor who see 
no other way out of poverty and are thus eager to be exploited. 
</P>
<P>
It's so easy living in the midst of this to assume that we've all been 
corrupted in these same ways. That even if we don't support it, we silently 
condone driving off our homeless, refusing care for our sick, withdrawing basic 
rights from fellow citizens whose color or race or life style frightens us, 
dealing with public issues through paranoia instead of reason, regarding 
kindness and selflessness as weakness instead of strength. So easy to make such 
assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for "Field of Dreams" to start the other night, we watched five 
trailers for upcoming movies based on those assumptions. Four of them were 
packed with violence -- wall-to-wall destruction of other human beings, 
physically and psychically. Cynical commercial statements that this is what the 
American public wants to see. Without question, watching vicarious violence is 
one way of taking out our frustrations over the growing conviction that things 
are not going well and we can't do much, if anything, about it. But it isn't 
the only -- and certainly not the best -- way.

Those lines around the block to see "Field of Dreams" offer a very different 
option. Those lines say to me that the soul-juice hasn't yet been squeezed out 
of every American, and that there are a whole hell of a lot of us who still 
dream and will leap at every chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Field of Dreams" is giving us that chance. It isn't a great movie, but the 
message is clear and sharp and welcome, and right now it's the only game in 
town. Maybe some of the people who make commercial entertainment will get the 
message. Maybe those who don't are incapable of making a film like this. 
</P>
<P>
But I think there is a more important message to be drawn from "Field of 
Dreams," perhaps an extension of what the movie has to say. And that message is 
the real nature of dreaming -- and the dreamer. We have been taught by the 
pragmatists in our midst that dreams are gauzy and impractical, and that 
dreamers are people who have abdicated the real world to hide in their own 
fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
All of us, dreamers and non-dreamers alike, have to live in that real world and 
deal with it reasonably effectively to survive. But the dreamer doesn't just 
survive. He lives. And only in those dreams can he draw on the real and 
enduring strength that matters.

I have over my desk a postcard my youngest daughter sent me from a trip several 
years ago. It carried a casual message, and I'm sure she didn't see it as 
portentous when she picked it out. But I'm also sure that something stirred in 
her as it does in me each time I look at it. The drawing shows a man in his 
bathrobe sitting on the peak of the roof of his house with a cup of coffee 
watching a sunrise. And dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball was an absolutely right symbol to convey this message in "Field of 
Dreams" because it combines the pragmatic and the mystical in such delicate 
balance. The friend who sent us to this movie understands that -- and he knew 
we would, too. We thank him -- and we thank all those other dreamers who stood 
in line with us.
