ENDRE BOHEM; WRITER, PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Endre Bohem, a writer and producer who fled his native Hungary shortly after 
World War I because Jews weren't permitted a college education, but 50 years 
later returned for what was believed the first joint film venture with an Iron 
Curtain country, has died. 
</P>
<P>
Bohem, producer of Clint Eastwood's first success, the television series 
"Rawhide," was 89 when he died Saturday at home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, he first became a scenarist and then a film producer. His 
early writing credits for the screen included the 1927 "Desert Night" which 
starred John Gilbert wearing an unprecedented all-white tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
Bohem worked for Eddie Manix at Metro Goldwyn Mayer and Harry Cohn at Columbia, 
where he produced short subjects, among them the Robert Benchley and "Passing 
Parade" series. 
</P>
<P>
As a producer, he made "Alias Nick Beal," "House of a Thousand Candles," "The 
Redhead and the Cowboy," "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes" and several more. 
</P>
<P>
His other TV series included "Revlon Mirror" and "Ford Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, Bohem returned to Hungary for the first time since his youth, where he 
and the national Hugarofilm company produced "The Boys of Paul Street," hailed 
as the first production between an American and Iron Curtain country. 
</P>
<P>
The antiwar film, based on a book featuring a boy hero known in Hungary as well 
as Tom Sawyer is in the United States, was nominated for an Academy Award as 
best foreign picture. 
</P>
<P>
Bohem is survived by his wife, Hilda, a son, daughter, five grandchildren and 
two great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
At his request there were no services.

MCA QUITS COLISEUM MANAGEMENT TEAM AND EFFORT TO KEEP THE RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MCA Inc. is bowing out of the management of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
and Sports Arena and the remaining partner, Spectacor Management Group, will 
become for the time being the sole private party attempting to make a deal to 
keep the Raiders in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The development, announced by Coliseum authorities Monday, raised new questions 
about efforts to reach an agreement with the Raiders organization. 
</P>
<P>
Spectacor Chairman Ed Snider said the change will not complicate talks with the 
Raiders, which, he said, continue to make progress. 
</P>
<P>
However, other sources said the decision of MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman to take 
his company out of the proposed deal with the Raiders for an expensive 
renovation of the Coliseum could make it more difficult to come up with an 
advance payment to the Raiders. Team owner Al Davis is reportedly insisting on 
a payment as a guarantee that the Coliseum will be improved. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said that neither MCA nor Spectacor was comfortable with payment of 
millions of dollars to the Raiders before a lengthy project approval process, 
including an environmental impact report and consultations with state historic 
preservation authorities, was complete. The approval process could take more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to the Raiders talks said Wasserman had indicated before the 
MCA decision to bow out that he was willing to put up money to help finance an 
environmental impact report, but had said, "I won't put up money to put in Al's 
(Davis') pocket." 
</P>
<P>
This source said the amount of advance money MCA would have been asked to put 
up ranged from $3 million to $7 million, depending on what the team would 
compromise on. 
</P>
<P>
An MCA spokeswoman said there would be no comment from the company confirming 
or denying Wasserman's reported statement. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the MCA decision, Al Teller, chairman of MCA Music Entertainment, 
said, "Stadium development, as opposed to management, is not within our current 
corporate and strategic goals. We applaud Spectacor's efforts and wish them 
luck in keeping an NFL football team active in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Monday evening, another source privy to the discussions said that Spectacor 
also is balking at a big advance payment, although Snider did not confirm this. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, which have been continuing discussions in the meantime on a 
possible new deal to move to Oakland, reportedly are uneasy about Los Angeles' 
capacity to guarantee Coliseum renovation, but they had nothing to say publicly 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, who has been trying to arrange a deal, also was said Monday 
to be concerned about the early payment issue. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, like the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, is committed to 
using no public money in what could be a Coliseum renovation, complete with 
thousands of club seats and 200 luxury boxes, that would cost in excess of $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, in reaching its recent deal with Spectacor and MCA, did commit 
itself to making a long-term $15-million loan to facilitate the reconstruction, 
but this agreement was worded to keep the $15 million in Coliseum hands until 
construction began. In short, it is not available for an advance payment to the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Irwindale made such a payment, giving the Raiders $10 million against 
a pledge to eventually finance a stadium in the San Gabriel Valley community. 
Financing could not be obtained and the Raiders kept the money. 
</P>
<P>
Snider Monday called MCA "an outstanding partner" and said he was sorry about 
its decision to leave the Coliseum management. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, since Spectacor officials had been in charge of management at the 
Coliseum and Sports Arena right along, the decision would have no immediate 
effect on how the facilities are run. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum announcement said Spectacor and MCA would continue to be 
associated with one another nationally in the marketing of concerts.

COURT UPHOLDS SAN DIEGO'S DRAINING OF LAKE MORENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Diego is free to drain as much water as it wants from Lake 
Morena, a reservoir in the county's far southeastern reaches, without having to 
comply with environmental laws by first filing an impact report, a state 
appellate court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
To run its reservoirs, the city has to be free to transfer billions of gallons 
of water from the popular boating, camping and fishing reservoir, as it did for 
months beginning in late 1988, the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Although that lengthy draining dramatically lowered the lake level and left 
wildlife habits menaced and businesses around the lake in jeopardy, any 
draining is an administrative function that does not require state review, a 
three-judge panel ruled unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Lake Morena-Campo Chamber of Commerce, which brought the court 
fight, said Monday they were stunned by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry McKee, a real estate agent and chairman of the chamber's Save the Lake 
committee, said the ruling was "disappointing and totally unexpected" because 
local residents felt confident that they had a legally and emotionally 
appealing case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in awe at the moment," McKee said. "You ask what it's doing out here, I 
say, set the people aside, look at the terrain and the impact on the 
environment -- it speaks for itself. When we get to July, August, September, 
I'd eat my hat if we don't have a major fish kill here. And I'm wearing a big 
hat." 
</P>
<P>
McKee and Richard Leach, the chamber president, said they are not sure whether 
they will appeal, after already incurring more than $20,000 in legal fees. 
"We've got to sit down and talk about it," Leach said. "But we're not the type 
of people who give up that easily." 
</P>
<P>
Lake Morena, built in 1912, is part of a three-reservoir system constructed to 
provide the city of San Diego with water. It is designed to supply water 
downstream to Barrett Lake and to Otay Reservoir, where a filtration plant 
processes the water for human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
With adequate water reserves for about 10 years before the city's 1988 
draining, the city did not transfer any water from Morena to Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, fish thrived and the lake became one of the region's 
principal stopovers for migratory birds. The lake also attracted plenty of 
people to its shores for boating, camping and fishing -- about 300,000 in 1988, 
according to county figures. 
</P>
<P>
That November, however, the city announced that it intended to move water from 
Morena to Barrett because Otay needed water, Barrett didn't have enough and 
Morena has a high evaporation rate, meaning the city risked losing billions of 
gallons. No environmental impact report was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Morena residents sued to try to stop the drainage, contending it had to be 
regulated under the California Environmental Quality Act, a law that requires 
state and local agencies to complete environmental impact studies for projects 
that may alter the project area. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Judge William C. Pate denied the residents' request, saying 
the drainage was not a "project" under the state law. 
</P>
<P>
Although residents appealed, the city transferred 2.8 billion gallons of water. 
A new shoreline about 30 feet below what was once the reservoir's edge emerged. 
The nearby village boat ramp no longer reached the water. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's opinion, the 4th District panel disagreed with Pate's conclusion 
that the drainage was not a "project." Nevertheless, Judge Ronald Domnitz said, 
the state law did not apply because it focused only on projects that involve 
decisions by public agencies that involve discretion. 
</P>
<P>
The move to drain Lake Morena, Domnitz said, was not based on anyone's personal 
opinion. Rather, it was a "ministerial activity," a sort not addressed by the 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
The only decision "to be made is the timing of the (drainage), not the method," 
Domnitz said. There is "no other choice than to use the water system for the 
purpose for which it was designed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Domnitz said the court understood that the drainage was likely to have a 
significant environmental impact on the reservoir. But the reservoir was 
designed to provide water, and the city could do "little or nothing" to 
mitigate any environmental damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since that was the case, Domnitz said, it would be "useless and wasteful" to 
require an impact report "every time (draining) of a reservoir is proposed for 
the ultimate purpose of supplying the community with water." 
</P>
<P>
Domnitz, a San Diego municipal judge, was specially assigned to hear the case. 
Judges Don R. Work and William L. Todd Jr. joined in the opinion.

BOARD REJECTS STIFFER RULE ON WEAPONS AT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial measure to expel all students caught with weapons on school 
campuses was rejected Monday by the Los Angeles Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
The motion lost on a 6-1 vote, with only board member Roberta Weintraub 
supporting the policy change, which would have removed district officials' 
discretion to transfer or temporarily suspend students who bring guns or knives 
to school. 
</P>
<P>
Board members complained that the measure was too broad and robbed students of 
constitutionally guaranteed protections by mandating that all cases, regardless 
of circumstances, require expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, expulsion decisions are made by special district panels that include 
a school psychologist and counselor, and are reviewed by the school board. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need to talk about is adding more counselors in school," argued board 
member Rita Walters. "Children are in trouble today and we do not help their 
problems . . . by talking about how we can kick them out of school faster." 
</P>
<P>
While current district policy recommends expulsion of students carrying weapons 
on campus, it allows "suspended enforcement" of the expulsions to permit 
students to attend special alternative education programs outside regular 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988-89 school year, more than 400 students were recommended for 
expulsion because they carried or used guns, knives, explosives or other 
"dangerous objects" at school. However, all but a few were transferred to 
other, more restrictive district programs, and most were allowed to return to 
regular schools after two semesters. 
</P>
<P>
The district's discipline policies have been hotly debated by the board since 
the release earlier this year of a task force report urging adoption of tougher 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The board has long subscribed to the notion that youngsters can be 
rehabilitated and has committed substantial resources to providing the 
alternative programs where troubled children could succeed. 
</P>
<P>
But the dramatic increase in weapons possession among elementary, junior high 
and high school students in recent years, and growing concern over attacks on 
students and teachers, led the board to consider tougher sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a lot of feeling on the part of some board members that it's 
more important to protect those students who bring weapons than to protect 
those who need to have a safe school environment," said Weintraub, who 
sponsored Monday's failed motion. "We need to send a message that it's not OK 
to bring guns on campus." 
</P>
<P>
Though the board rejected the notion of automatic expulsion, it did vote 6 to 1 
to consider the task force report recommending tougher discipline policies, and 
will hold a series of meetings to discuss the report during the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Many board members are concerned that more stringent policies might result in 
the district neglecting troubled, but redeemable, students -- particularly 
those very young children who do not qualify for programs outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
Under so-called straight expulsion, those students would simply be out of 
school for at least a year, at which time they could seek reinstatement but 
would have to demonstrate that they had been rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma for the district is: "Are we trying to keep kids in school, or are 
we trying to get rid of our problems," said Don Bolton, head of the district's 
student attendance and adjustment services. "And if we're trying to get rid of 
our problems, which ones are we trying to get rid of?"

DRUG INJECTORS FOUND AMONG MEDICAL WASTE ON BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three devices used to inject a potentially harmful drug that can induce rapid 
heartbeat, fever and delirium washed up on San Diego beaches last week amid 
other medical waste, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The injectors, which look like crayons, are placed against the skin and release 
a needle that injects the drug, atropine -- an antidote for nerve gas. The 
injectors are routinely supplied to all Navy ships as protection against a 
nerve gas attack, said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Doug Schamp. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three devices were found at Pacific Beach and Mission Beach, along 
with 100 bottles of penicillin and several hundred strips of anti-malarial 
pills, said Linda Miller, spokeswoman for the San Diego County district 
attorney's office, which is a member of the Hazardous Waste Task Force. It is 
unknown where the third injector was found, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-inch-long, 1/2-inch wide cylindrical injectors are sealed in plastic 
bags, but could easily penetrate the plastic, officials warn. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is slap it against your skin and it automatically injects 
-- it's pretty easy to use," said Miller. Parents should warn their children to 
not touch any object on the beach that looks "unusual," she advised. 
</P>
<P>
Both children and adults should be careful walking and playing at the beach, 
she said. If injected, a person should immediately contact a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation is under way to track the source of the injectors. Officials 
are uncertain whether all have been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"How do we know what's out there? Maybe there's a whole bucketful or maybe it's 
just these three," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy issues three injectors in a kit for military personnel aboard ships, 
said Schamp. Each injector contains a dose of 2 milligrams. During a 
bombardment of nerve gas, individuals are supposed to inject themselves with 
the three dispensers, allowing the drug to bond to the body's nerve endings to 
protect them against the gas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fairly convinced that the ones that were found are of military origin," 
Schamp said. "And we're pretty concerned. We want to make sure it doesn't 
happen again. But we also don't think it should cause hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Atropine, first discovered in the early 1830s, can accelerate the heart beat, 
cause fever, dry mouth, blurry vision, and hot, dry and sometimes flushed skin. 
Weakness and giddiness can occur, as well as shallow breathing and delirium. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the 2-milligram dose would be life-threatening to a healthy 
child or adult," said Anthony Manoguerra, director of the San Diego Regional 
Poison Center at UC San Diego Medical Center. "It would make someone sick -- 
maybe requiring 24 hours in a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
For adults or children with heart conditions, the drug poses a special hazard 
and could induce a heart attack, Manoguerra cautions. In addition, the effects 
on children would be more pronounced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disgrace that this was allowed to happen," said Jim Jacobson, director 
of the Alliance for Survival, an environmental group. "It's got to be tracked 
down; we have to find out who the guilty party is and prosecute them." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has strict rules governing the disposal of medical waste, Schamp said. 
Injectors, like the ones found, are supposed to be activated before they are 
discarded. The contents -- the drugs -- are usually dumped in the sewage system 
and the injector is deposited in a container, according to regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The injectors found last week contained a drug that had expired last June, but 
it is not known whether the medication would have lost its effectiveness, said 
Schamp. The medical officer of each ship is supposed to make sure supplies 
aboard a vessel are up to date and have not expired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we are not happy with this because there are measures to preclude 
this very thing from happening," Schamp said.

BEACH BOY BRIAN WILSON'S KIN CLAIM HE'S 'BRAINWASHED'; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRITY: FORMER PSYCHOLOGIST IS ACCUSED OF CONTROLLING HIS LIFE. THE SINGER 
SHOWS UP AT A PRESS CONFERENCE TO CHALLENGE COUSIN'S PETITION TO BECOME HIS 
CONSERVATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The long-playing, woe-filled ballad of Beach Boy Brian Wilson's return from 
mental illness and substance abuse took a bizarre turn on Monday as Wilson's 
cousin filed a court petition claiming that the rock singer has been 
"brainwashed" by a former psychologist who has taken control of Wilson's 
recording enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the charges were being outlined at a Los Angeles press conference, 
Wilson walked in -- uninvited -- to respond to the claims by his cousin, former 
professional basketball player Stan Love. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, glaring icily, took over the lectern during the suddenly tense press 
conference and angrily denounced the legal action. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the charges) are outrageous . . . out of the ballpark," Wilson said, 
even while his attorney exchanged words and glares with Love's associates. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for only a few moments, Wilson told reporters that he performed twice 
with the Beach Boys on Sunday in San Francisco and denied allegations that he 
has been brainwashed into rejecting his mother, two daughters and other members 
of the Wilson family. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great and my life is back on track," Wilson said, adding: "I see who I 
want to see and I am in charge of my own life." 
</P>
<P>
He declined, however, to answer questions concerning his personal and 
professional involvement with Eugene Landy, the so-called "psychologist to the 
stars" who treated Wilson for several years before 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Landy voluntarily surrendered his license to practice psychology in 
California as part of a settlement with the state involving charges of 
professional misconduct, including having sex with a female patient. As part of 
the settlement, Landy admitted to a single charge of unlawfully prescribing 
drugs and agreed not to petition for reinstatement for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Since abandoning his practice, Landy has worked as Wilson's partner in a Santa 
Monica-based record-producing company called "Brains and Genius," where Landy 
develops projects and co-writes songs, said Wilson's attorney, John Mason. 
</P>
<P>
Love, who filed a request in Santa Monica Superior Court to become Wilson's 
conservator, accused Landy of taking "extensive control" over Wilson's business 
deals and personal affairs, to the point that "he is unable to properly provide 
for his personal needs for food, clothing, housing and physical or mental 
health." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on Love's petition was set for June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Love, who said he was acting on behalf of the rest of Wilson's family, said he 
hopes that the court will order independent psychological and psychiatric 
evaluations of Wilson and permit members of the singer's family to learn the 
full extent of his financial involvement with Landy. 
</P>
<P>
The monetary stakes involve "Brian Wilson's estate, whatever (dollar amount) 
that is," said Love's attorney, Thomas M. Monson. "We do expect it to be in 
excess of $1 million, certainly." 
</P>
<P>
"He's totally controlled . . . a puppet," Love said of the singer. "I've made 
50 to 100 phone calls trying to see Brian. I can't even have any access to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Love, a former forward for the Lakers who is the brother of Beach Boys lead 
singer Mike Love, also charged that Brian Wilson "has not been allowed to see 
his mother for more than five hours in the past five years and . . . has not 
been allowed to spend more than five hours in that five years with his two 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel Brian is being held a virtual hostage," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Landy did not return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's mother, Audree Wilson, said she supported the actions by Love and 
called Landy "the worst news that ever happened" to her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's pretty well brainwashed Brian," Audree Wilson said in a telephone 
interview. "He manipulates him, that's all I know. He just hasn't been a free 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Although she regularly receives phone calls from her son, she has given up 
trying to contact Brian on her own, she said. "If he calls you, that's great," 
she said. "But . . . you can't get through to him. If you call his home, you 
get the answering machine. To get through to him you have to go through the 
office -- and you're put on hold. It's just a crock. I won't be so insulted. 
That's my son!" 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the family could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's daughters, Carnie and Wendy, are successful singers who are now 
performing in Europe. Beach Boys Carl Wilson, Alan Jardine, Mike Love and Bruce 
Johnston are also on tour. 
</P>
<P>
Love claimed to have support for his petition from the two daughters and the 
Beach Boys singers. But a publicist released a statement saying members of the 
group would withhold comment on the charges until they could investigate the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's attorney, Mason, questioned how the band members could be supporting 
the charges when they were appearing on stage with Wilson again Monday night in 
San Francisco. Last year Brian Wilson did 50 shows with the group, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
"How can he be keeping everyone away from him when they're performing 
together?" the attorney asked. "This whole thing of Stan's is preposterous."

HIGH SCHOOL OPENS MOVABLE ART GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WEINSTOCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Battered desks and broken typewriters have been shoved back, walls erected, the 
floor carpeted. What was a dark, cramped storage area became the Oxnard High 
School Art Gallery, one of the few school galleries in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery, which opened Monday, is the brainchild of Ray Wood, who runs the 
school's Art Department. Using $1,000 in seed money from the district, he has 
devoted his lunch hours to design and build the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a look at the storage area next to the Art Department; it was a real 
eyesore," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the idea that if I created an art gallery, especially one that could be 
taken down and moved to a new location if we got a new high school, maybe they 
would go for it. And they did," he said of school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery, which has two walls made of plexiglass panels and two of 
whitewashed plywood, was built in sections that are bolted together. Thus, the 
gallery can be disassembled and rebuilt when Oxnard High moves to a new campus 
in three years as planned. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-foot by 30-foot gallery is large enough to handle a full-size show of 30 
to 70 pieces of art, depending on their size. Paintings, drawings and 
photographs are hung Louvre-style, covering floor to ceiling of two walls, 
while sculpture and ceramics sit on shelves or on stands along the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, as in many high schools, artwork was displayed randomly in the 
library, offices and the faculty lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the plexiglass walls allow students to view the art as they change 
classes, even though the gallery will be locked most of the time for security 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The opening show will display many of the contest winners, from a portrait of 
Chinese leader Mao Zedong in electric-green pastels, to a pen and ink lion's 
head, and stark, black and white photographs of couples. 
</P>
<P>
One photographer, sophomore Stephanie Sunwoo, already has won recognition. This 
summer, she will study at California State Summer School for the Arts at Mills 
College near San Francisco. She is one of 400 students chosen from several 
thousand applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he hopes to exhibit work by professional artists whom he periodically 
invites to lecture or demonstrate their techniques to his art students. CAROL

Rejecting a management offer by an 86% majority, nearly 1,000 Kaiser Permanente 
registered nurses at facilities on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles and in 
Inglewood voted to go on strike next Sunday at 12:01 a.m., union officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout would follow a 10-day strike by other employees of Kaiser in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties last month. The nurses voted Monday on the offer by

4-VEHICLE CRASH TURNS FREEWAY INTO INFERNO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were burned by hot roofing tar Monday in a traffic accident on 
California 94 during the morning rush hour that caused most of the busy freeway 
to close for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
The chain-reaction accident occurred at about 8:45 a.m. near the Euclid Avenue 
off-ramp and involved four vehicles in the westbound lanes of the highway when 
a load of heating and air-conditioning equipment fell out of a flatbed truck, 
said California Highway Patrol officer Ron Boggeln. 
</P>
<P>
A van following the truck tried to avoid the debris and slowed suddenly, 
Boggeln said. The van was hit from behind by an El Cajon Roofing company truck 
towing a trailer carrying a tank of hot roofing tar. That truck swerved to the 
left and was hit by an 18-wheel dump truck, Boggeln said. The dump truck then 
hit the center divider. 
</P>
<P>
"The contact between the two vehicles caused the truck carrying the tar to spin 
around," Boggeln said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men who were riding in the bed of the tar truck -- George Vazquez, 38, 
and Billy Ray Snow, 34 -- were thrown out. Hot tar flew out of the pot and onto 
them, Boggeln said. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez, of El Cajon, and Snow, of Lakeside, were taken to UCSD Medical Center. 
Vazquez was listed in serious condition with second- and third-degree burns 
over 25% to 30% of his body. Snow had second- and third-degree burns over 10% 
of his body and was listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
Tar also fell onto the bed of the truck and ignited materials. The driver, 
Everardo Muniz, and another passenger, Jerry D'Aoust, who was riding in the 
cab, escaped without injury. 
</P>
<P>
"All I saw (were) things flying," said Muniz. "The guy in front of us slammed 
on his brakes, we slammed on ours. I bumped the guy in front of me and got 
pushed into the other lane." 
</P>
<P>
Muniz said the dump truck was behind him but "tried to swerve to the left as we 
went to the left. He hit us and knocked us around. He (the dump truck) kept 
going left and hit the center divider. He ended up right against the guard 
rail." 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez's clothes caught fire, Muniz said. "People were pulling over and 
offering blankets," Muniz said. 
</P>
<P>
D'Aoust, who is also a volunteer firefighter for the Crest Fire Department in 
El Cajon, said, "George caught fire and we had to get him away from the truck. 
We patted him down and had him (lie) down and roll to smother the fire." 
</P>
<P>
The truck was destroyed when a propane line leading from the truck bed to a 
pilot light below the tar tank broke, said Capt. Jeff Carle of the Metro Arson 
Strike Team. The hot tar and burning materials ignited the propane gas, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters about 15 minutes to quell the fire, Carle said, adding 
that firefighters remained on the scene for about two hours to cool off the tar 
and clean up the debris on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez and Snow are employed by El Cajon Roofing, said Kathy Clark, an owner 
of the firm. Both Vazquez and Snow have been employed there for about 10 years, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both real family men," she said. "They're great employees, they always 
take pride in their work. We're a small business and we think of them as 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Only the men's wives were permitted to visit them, Muniz said. "They've got 
some pretty bad burns. They're going to be OK, it's just going to take a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
All of the westbound lanes and four of the eastbound lanes were closed to 
traffic, but most were reopened by noon, a CHP dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the only lanes remaining closed were the fast lanes on both sides 
of the highway. Caltrans repaired the guard rail by 3 p.m., and all the lanes 
were open to traffic by the afternoon rush hour, said CHP officer Joe Wolf.

COUNCIL KILLS PLAN TO FORM TAX DISTRICTS

<P>
After a lengthy and hotly debated public hearing, the Ventura City Council 
reversed its prior vote and repealed an ordinance that would have allowed the 
city to establish tax assessment districts. 
</P>
<P>
On a 4-2 vote, the council instructed staff to rewrite the ordinance so that it 
would be limited to assessment districts to pay for the maintenance of public 
waterways. 
</P>
<P>
Such a revised ordinance would still allow the council to pursue its original 
goal of charging the Ventura Keys, a marina community, with part of the costs 
of dredging silt that has been accumulating for the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday night's hearing, Keys homeowner Ray Russum led a group of 50 
residents opposed to the ordinance in a emotional debate, punctuated by jeers 
against the council members. They argued that the city would use the ordinance, 
as originally drafted, to impose assessment districts indiscriminately 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"You made a mistake in including the whole city in this scheme to take the 
taxpayers to the cleaners," Russum told the council amid loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's vote was a reversal from the April 23 meeting in which the 
council voted unanimously to give the ordinance preliminary approval. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Todd Collart acknowledged the opposition. "With the applause and 
harassment, it looks like the public has no confidence in the city," he said, 
before proposing that the ordinance be reworked. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

CITY HALL PAPER WILL BE RECYCLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council on Monday unanimously approved a City Hall office 
paper recycling program as part of a continuing effort to reduce the flow of 
garbage into local landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," Councilwoman Ann Rock said of the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
"Every little bit helps." 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that the program will cost $1,150 to start up and 
$2,300 to operate annually. But savings in regular trash collection charges and 
the sale of recyclable paper is expected to generate $2,850 a year for the 
city, a $550 profit. 
</P>
<P>
Recyclable paper constitutes about 90% of the trash generated by City Hall 
offices, according to a city staff report. Fax paper, computer paper and 
envelopes make up a large portion of the recyclable materials, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Government Center and the cities of Ventura and Oxnard 
already have similar recycling programs in place. 
</P>
<P>
A recent state law requires that cities devise a plan by the end of the year to 
reduce the flow of trash into landfills by 25% by 1995, and by 50% by the turn 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its own effort to meet that goal, the Simi Valley City Council voted 
last month to expand its curbside recycling program from 1,000 to 13,000 
households. By April of 1991, the program is expected to serve all 25,000 
households in the city. CARLOS V. LOZANO

The Thousand Oaks city clerk has been presented the highest state award in her 
field because of her longtime service to the city, local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting in San Diego, Nancy Dillon was given the City Clerk of the 
Year award of the City Clerks Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
She was nominated by a group of her peers and selected by the president of the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Dillon received the association's Award of Distinction for a handbook 
that she designed that described the functions of Thousand Oaks city government 
to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Dillon, who has served on the executive board of the state City Clerks Assn., 
joined the Thousand Oaks staff in 1976 as a clerk. She also served as executive 
assistant to the city manager before being named city clerk in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her responsibilities include conducting city elections, overseeing city 
records, maintaining the city archives and updating municipal codes and 
ordinances. She also coordinates more than 35 council-appointed citizen 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still stunned by the honor and surprised," Dillon said. TINA DAUNT

Contrary to what you might think, Elvis lives at 49 addresses in L.A. That is, 
49 dogs go by the Big E's name, according to the latest survey by the Animal 
Regulation Department. It's an even 50 if you count a mutt named, incredibly, 
Snoopy Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
Of the city's 215,929 registered hounds, 32 are named Zsa Zsa. Other celebrity 
noms de pooch include Bigfoot (26), Madonna (18), Lady Di (10), and Prince 
Charles (3). 
</P>
<P>
But the city's most popular dog names are somewhat more prosaic. Lady (with 
2,513) ranks first, followed by Max (2,138), Brandy (1,753), Rocky (1,578), 
Duke (1,492), Bear (1,469), Princess (1,429) and Ginger (1,399). 
</P>
<P>
Apricot Moose, Rocky Raccoon and Smut the Mutt (1 each) are tied for last.

Noting that L.A.'s newly formed Tortilla Industry Assn. hopes to induce diners

to say: 
</P>

"I grew up on peanut butter and jelly burritos -- I'm half Danish and half

In fact, Espinosa adds that the dish is even tastier "if you throw it into hot

The short stories in "Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe," though written in 
Chandler's style, aren't the equivalent of Elvis imitations. In fact, the 
authors, all established mystery writers, succeed often in conjuring up visions 
of pre-freeway, pre-mini-mall L.A.

<P>
In Dick Lochte's "Sad-Eyed Blonde," a character says: "He's got a crummy little 
rat trap in Venice. On the canal." (Let's hope he didn't sell it.) 
</P>
<P>
A character in Jeremiah Healy's "In the Line of Duty" pays the ultimate 
compliment to the now-closed L.A. Public Library: ". . . He could drop it into 
the middle of Boston and it wouldn't even look out of place." 
</P>
<P>
And in "Malibu Tag Team" Jonathan Valin writes of the now-shuttered Olympic 
Auditorium: "On a good night, with a good card, the doorway would have been 
crowded with fans and reporters and a few well-dressed women with blood in 
their eyes, looking for one more bout to cap the evening." 
</P>
<P>
We reported the other day that "The Taking of Beverly Hills" is actually being 
shot in Mexico City on a mock-up of Rodeo Drive. Now comes an equally shocking 
report in Entertainment Weekly that "Scenes From a Mall," which is set in the 
Beverly Center, was actually filmed at the Stamford, Conn., Town Center. Well, 
most of it. One scene in "Scenes" will have to be shot elsewhere because the 
Connecticut Mall doesn't have a sushi bar.

<P>
Beverly Hills must have blood in its eyes by now.

 "The logical way I would look at it as a taxpayer and as if I were in city 
government would be to develop enough revenue-generating sources not on the 
pier itself, but over the sand adjacent to the 
</P>
<P>
pier. The profits from retail stores, restaurants, etc., would establish a 
revolving fund, if you will, for the annual maintenance which is so important 
for that pier. If you don't maintain it each year, gradually it gets worse and 
worse. Then you have a storm, and you're in the dire straits it's in now. City 
governments are increasingly facing a shortfall of funding, and you can't 
maintain present levels of existing services if you're not at the same time 
generating funds to augment taxpayer dollars. The pier is traditional with 
Ventura, it's important to Ventura for its residents and its visitors, so we 
should do what we can to make sure it's usable."

 "The restoration is a very important opportunity to bring the beach back to 
our city. Planning should be done with the community in mind, not with the idea 
of bringing in people from Santa Monica or 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco. The business uses of the pier should be planned with the people 
and the history of Ventura in mind. The pier has a long history. The city 
should insist on an element in the contract for restoration that a public 
historian should conduct research into the historical uses of the pier and at 
the base of the pier. An interpretive element could be incorporated into the 
best commercial uses identified from the historical information. This should 
not, however, turn out to be a theme park, but an honest attempt to bring back 
the flavor of Ventura for Venturans before the freeway cut us in half."

 "The fishermen would sure like to see the pier restored, and so would I. If we 
had a longer pier, it would be a lot better. There's more fish out there at the 
end of the pier. You get better-size fish out there. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer you get mackerel, and all kinds of other good fish, halibut and 
sea bass out at the end of the pier. Restaurants and concessions won't bother 
us at all. It won't hurt us a bit. No way. Even the bait shop down there says 
they will get more business if there are more doings down at the pier. Lots of 
people like to walk on the pier, just to see the ocean. It's a tourist trap 
right now. There is not enough room for all the fishermen at the pier now. It's 
too packed. Sometimes you can't find room for your pole. I've seen the pier 
repaired about five times over the years. I've seen waves go clear over the 
top."

<P>
Ed Robings 
</P>
<P>
Executive director, Ventura County Museum of History and Art 
</P>
<P>
 "The pier is important to the city's economy. It's also important 
historically. We're part of the hospitality industry in Ventura County. We have 
many tour groups that come to the museum. I feel 
</P>
<P>
that we need more tourist attractions and more things to entertain those people 
who visit our beaches and visit Ventura County. The best thing about tourists 
is they bring money with them and leave it behind when they go. It's important 
to stress that improved facilities and amenities at the pier would not only be 
used by out-of-towners and tourists, but also by local residents. Restoration 
and improvement of the pier is an important thing to do. I don't think of the 
pier the same way I do a very old house or the Ventura City Hall. I think of 
the pier as being in the ocean and subject to dramatic storms we have."

Chairman of the steering committee for Alliance for Ventura's Future 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a youngster, my dad and I went down to the pier frequently for 
fishing. It's a place to get away from the hustle and bustle, find some peace 
and quiet. It's a good place for families to have 
</P>
<P>
outings. I do have some concerns about the type of development they want to put 
on the pier. I would want to see the amount of development limited so it 
doesn't end up dominating the pier. This is something that has not been spelled 
out, exactly what they intend to do. I would think things oriented toward 
supplying fish bait, fishing supplies, a restaurant, things of this nature, are 
very compatible. I would not want to see it become a carnival-type thing. I 
don't think that's the direction most people want it to go. I do have some 
reservations about the city taking over the ownership just by nature of the 
cost of the maintenance."

TIDE MAY BE TURNING ON SLUDGE PROPOSALS; 
</P>
<P>
SEWAGE: LOS ANGELES CITY OFFICIALS HOPE THEY HAVE OVERCOME OPPOSITION TO THE 
SPREADING OF WASTE ON FIELDS NEAR LANCASTER. THE TEST WILL BE A PLAN THAT IS UP 
FOR DEBATE THURSDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles sanitation official said Monday that city officials hope they 
have "turned the corner" in overcoming objections in the Antelope Valley to the 
use of Los Angeles sewage sludge as fertilizer on farms in the Lancaster area. 
</P>
<P>
Despite early opposition in the Lancaster area, and the temporary suspension of 
a sister project in Blythe, a private contractor will seek a state license 
Thursday to spread an average of 20 tons of the sludge each day on a 640-acre 
ranch 10 miles east of Lancaster, said Sheila Molyneux, a Bureau of Sanitation 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
Molyneux told the city's Board of Public Works that she expects 10 farmers in 
the Antelope Valley to support the project at a hearing before the California 
Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
The sludge -- nutrient-rich remnants of solid waste from the city's sewage 
system, which has been treated and concentrated -- is actually more 
environmentally safe as a soil supplement than chemical fertilizers, said water 
board member Felicia Marcus. Marcus, an environmental activist, said it was 
unfortunate that the use of the sludge as fertilizer has generated controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got farmers from all over who want our sludge," Molyneux said. 
</P>
<P>
A state water quality board decision to permit the sludge to be applied to 
Antelope Valley farmland would boost the city's efforts to find a home for the 
tons of sewage it generates daily. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement in March that the city planned to dispose of the sludge on 
five Mojave Desert farms totaling 3,500 acres drew widespread publicity in the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
After the project became known, the owners of four of the five farms decided 
not to accept the sludge. At least one of them was scared off by the negative 
publicity, Molyneux said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the use of the city's sludge on farms in Blythe in Riverside 
County was temporarily suspended recently after citizens raised questions about 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
The water quality board's staff late last month circulated a recommendation for 
approval of the project to dispose of 20 dry tons a day of Los Angeles sludge 
in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bio Gro Systems Inc., which has a contract to dispose of hundreds of tons of 
the sludge, is seeking a state permit to apply sludge to a farm it owns in the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
One possible obstacle to Bio Gro's application could be raised by Los Angeles 
County. As of late Monday, county Planning Department officials were still 
trying to determine if the company's proposal requires a county land use 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
If a county permit is needed, the water board would postpone Thursday's 
hearing. The board's position is that Bio Gro must obtain all needed local 
permits before the board will consider an application. 
</P>
<P>
The city pays Bio Gro, which supplied the Blythe project with sludge, $27 to 
$38 per wet ton to remove the sludge from city sewage plants. A dry ton equals 
about four wet tons. The city has agreed to provide Bio-Grow with a minimum of 
150 wet tons of sludge per day, if Bio-Grow can find a market for it. 
</P>
<P>
The city produces about 1,350 wet tons per day, some of which is burned to 
generate electricity, some used as fertilizer in Yuma, Ariz., and some used as 
landfill cover in a West Covina dump.

VOLUNTEERS STEP IN TO HELP DAY LABORERS; 
</P>
<P>
TOPANGA CANYON: IN RESPONSE TO EFFORTS TO ROUST THE HOMELESS, A GROUP IS 
PROVIDING FOOD, TRANSPORTATION, STEADIER WORK AND SHELTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fog lifted from the mountains as steam rose from the large pot of chili, 
warming the faces and hands of several dozen day laborers. The morning air was 
still chilled in Topanga Canyon, and the men lined up eagerly as volunteers 
handed out hot soup, slices of bread and fruit for their breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the quiet scene was interrupted by shouts from a passing truck. 
Although the driver's words weren't entirely clear as he sped by on Topanga 
Canyon Road, his angry tone and the word "them" were readily discernible. 
Volunteers Marg Starbuck and Susan Lovell looked at each other, shook their 
heads and continued passing out food. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wait for government to take care of them, we'll wait forever," said 
Lovell, a movement therapist who has lived in the canyon on and off since 1965. 
Lovell recently joined a group known as PATCH -- People Assisting Topanga 
Canyon's Homeless -- which was formed several months ago to help day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
As the presence of day laborers persists in Topanga Canyon, residents remain 
divided on whether to embrace, shun or simply tolerate them. In recent weeks, 
however, after a year of stepped-up sheriff's patrols and immigration raids 
that defied the community's bohemian reputation, Topanga seems to have shifted 
back to its liberal roots. 
</P>
<P>
One group of volunteers cooks and serves soup every morning, Monday through 
Friday. Another holds English classes twice a week in a local church. Another 
is seeking bus service for the isolated canyon, so day laborers will have 
transportation to and from their jobs. Still another is hoping to establish a 
hiring center and talking about low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Most are working under the auspices of PATCH. Several PATCH members said they 
formed the group in response to town meetings and letters in the canyon 
newspaper, The Messenger, in which residents urged each other not to hire day 
laborers and to turn them in to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"This outraged me because I didn't think this was the way to treat people," 
said journalist Flavia Potenza. "The articles I was reading for five or six 
months seemed more like a ploy for the Sheriff's Department and the INS." 
</P>
<P>
Maryana Kuretski, a family therapist, said: "All of us feel very strongly that 
these people are a part of our community. We are using them. There are a lot of 
jobs up here, mainly in construction, and it is our obligation to integrate 
them into our community." 
</P>
<P>
For Potenza, who moved to Topanga 15 years ago from New York City, the 
day-laborer debate also signifies the canyon's gentrification as property 
values increase, and a more conventional crowd moves in. About 9,000 people 
live in the canyon, according to Town Council President Marty Brastow. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't yell at you about your dogs anymore. They sue you," Potenza 
said. "The funkiness of the canyon has gotten cleaned up. It just seems that 
people are into looking good more than being good. But the miracle of it all is 
that the spirit of Topanga still abides, and that's what came forth in this 
whole process." 
</P>
<P>
Before organizing its programs, PATCH members sought out day laborers camping 
in hills and creeks and asked them in an informal survey what they needed most. 
Food, transportation, steadier work and shelter were the answers in order of 
priority, said Kuretski and Starbuck. 
</P>
<P>
For the last six weeks or so, every weekday morning, as many as 50 men gather 
near the corner of Topanga Canyon and Old Topanga Canyon roads for the homemade 
soup. Starbuck, an artist, picks up groceries donated by Topanga and Santa 
Monica markets and passes them out to a network of cooks, who take turns 
serving their creations from the backs of the trucks and vans. 
</P>
<P>
The food is served between 9:15 and 9:30 a.m. on the theory that those who have 
gotten work for the day have already been picked up. "These are the ones who 
probably won't work, so they get fed," Starbuck said. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning -- as they ate Starbuck's chili and fresh grapefruit 
donated by a local store -- the men told stories about their trips from Central 
America, their frightening experiences at the hands of armed bandits in Mexico 
and the hardships in often hostile Los Angeles neighborhoods. Several said 
Topanga Canyon is popular among day laborers because of generous wages -- $5 or 
$6 an hour compared with an average of $4 an hour elsewhere in the city -- in 
addition to its friendly residents and, now, its soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's real helpful, and demonstrates that the American people -- as 
I've always believed and been told -- are very humanitarian," said farmer 
Thomas Carnales, 42, who said he left El Salvador after his 16-year-old son was 
killed by guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"You can ask for a favor and these women will do it for you," Carnales said. 
</P>
<P>
But some canyon homeowners, for reasons that vary from worries about property 
values to fire danger, are concerned about the generous reputation PATCH is 
fostering for Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a Godforsaken place for an impoverished Guatemalan to take a night 
class in English," said filmmaker David Gottlieb, a Topanga-Las Virgenes 
Resource Conservation District board member who specializes in fire prevention. 
"What I fear is that it's going to encourage them to live in the brush in 
Topanga." 
</P>
<P>
Christina Johnson, a fashion designer who ignited the controversy last year 
after she and her husband Howard discovered several encampments next to their 
property, said a fear of fire was her main objection to the day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
"The campsites we saw were quite volatile with open fire pits and all sorts of 
debris. That truly alarmed us," said Johnson, who said her family lost its home 
in the 1961 Bel-Air fire, in which scores of hillside houses were destroyed. "I 
know what it's like to be a child and go to school one day with having a normal 
household and come home and have ashes on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
In response to calls from residents, sheriff's deputies cleared away many 
campsites and established a satellite station within the canyon. Immigration 
patrols increased too, leading to the arrest of 41 illegal workers in Malibu 
and Topanga last November. 
</P>
<P>
Some outdoor camps still exist, and several day laborers acknowledged that they 
often spend the night in the canyon rather than return by hitchhiking and bus 
to inner-city Los Angeles. But Brastow and Dorland said the worst of the fire 
danger and littering seems to be over. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, some of my concern is property values. Why wouldn't there be?" said 
Dorland, who objected to day laborers who drank, littered and "caroused" under 
a bridge near his home. "If you moved into a place you thought was paradise and 
all of a sudden someone put a dump in front of you, you wouldn't be very happy. 
I'm happy that property values in Topanga Canyon have gone up, and I'd be a 
hypocrite if I didn't say that." 
</P>
<P>
But even Dorland, who said he had been branded the "David Duke of Topanga," 
credited PATCH with warning day laborers of the dangers of garbage and open 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
"Amazingly enough, through numerous cleanups by the sheriffs, INS and education 
by PATCH, if they're still under the bridge, they're now cleaning their garbage 
up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I had is totally disappeared."

DROUGHT IN COUNTY CALLED STATE'S WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only about six inches of rain fell in Ventura County this season, 34% of the 
average rainfall in non-drought years, according to statistics released by the 
county's Flood Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
The county had less rain between November and April than in any of the past 
four drought years, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The normal average rainfall for the county is 17.12 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the countywide average was 57% of normal. Two years ago, it was 92% 
and three years ago it was 45%. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme has the lowest rainfall in the county, with only 3.25 inches 
total. 
</P>
<P>
County hydrologist Dolores Taylor said Ventura County is experiencing the most 
severe drought of any county in the state, according to the published figures.

MONITORING OF INMATE AND ATTORNEY INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County sheriff's deputy secretly monitored a conversation between 
murder suspect Gregory Scott Smith and his attorneys last month, possibly 
violating state law, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was talking with his attorneys in a conference room at the county jail on 
an undetermined day in early April when Deputy A. C. Quintero switched on the 
intercom in their room and overheard a brief part of their conversation, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Peter Kossoris said. Quintero reported the incident to the district 
attorney's office, triggering investigations by the Sheriff's Department and 
the California attorney general's office, said Assistant Sheriff Richard Bryce. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 21, is being held in the March 23 murder of Paul Bailly, 8, of 
Northridge, whose gagged, burned body was found in a brush fire March 23 near 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, who has less than two years' experience on the sheriff's jail staff, 
may have violated a statute against intercepting a confidential communication 
between attorney and client, Bryce said. It was only the second time in 20 
years that someone allegedly violated that law in Ventura County, County 
Counsel Frank O. Sieh said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce said Quintero was in the control room on the day of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The best information I have is that, in trying to locate a specific person, he 
was switching through the rooms trying to make contact with someone and 
inadvertently turned on the microphone," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero heard a snatch of conversation among Smith and Public Defenders Duane 
Dammeyer and Richard Holly, who have since requested a gag order from Ventura 
County Superior Court to prevent Quintero from discussing what he heard, 
Dammeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're embarrassed by the situation," Bryce said. "We pride ourselves on 
cooperating with the public defender, as well as the district attorney, and we 
don't want to do anything to disrupt that relationship."

GINGERBREAD HOUSE: AN ENCINO HOME'S FIRST OWNER ADMIRED TRADITIONAL NORWEGIAN 
COUNTRY HOUSES WITH COLORFUL FOLK ART DECORATIONS. THE NEW RESIDENT WANTS IT TO 
BE SAFER.

<P>
Encino's gingerbread house is melting away, like the ending of a fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
For years, children walked past the Norwegian country house on Greenleaf Street 
to watch the gardener mow the roof. 
</P>
<P>
They gawked at carvings of leaves on the eaves or, if they were invited inside, 
wondered at the Norwegian folk art called Rosemaling covering the high living 
room ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
They called it the "Gingerbread House" or the "Hansel and Gretel Cottage," and 
word of the unusual residence spread until it received worldwide press coverage 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But a face lift by the home's new owner, Encino Realtor Albert Foulad, is 
greatly changing the house of fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Foulad, president of Century 21 Albert Foulad Realty Corp., recently stripped 
the roof of its distinctive lawn and the sprinkler that watered it. He said he 
is awaiting the arrival of a black and white tile roof. 
</P>
<P>
He has removed the leaf carvings on the eaves around the house and reduced a 
rock and brick fireplace in the center of the living room, smoothing the sides 
and covering them with white marble tile that he also is installing in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Foulad said he removed the sod from the roof and the leaf carvings around the 
eaves because of termite damage. He smoothed the rock surfaces of the fireplace 
to make the living room safe for his sons, 2 and 8, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some distinctively decorated wooden columns and the Rosemaling -- decorative 
flower paintings on the ceilings -- will be preserved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday the quiet back yard of the 3,000-square-foot home provided a peaceful 
reminder of its past. A well-manicured lawn leads to a large swimming pool. A 
half dozen leafy fruit trees grow beside the yard and tall hedges and palms 
provide privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But in front of the house, several parked trucks and a half-dozen workers 
provided passers-by with a radically changed sight. Black roofing paper covered 
the former sod roof as a worker cut marble tiles. 
</P>
<P>
The three-bedroom home was originally built on 10 acres at 17520 Greenleaf St. 
in 1938 by comedian Ben Blue, who had been to Norway and admired the 
traditional sod-roofed country houses there, with their colorful folk art 
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Blue built a stable, a small race track and another house that was a smaller 
version of the first and used the property as a home and working ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Ann Cowans and her husband acquired the residence in 1973, two years before 
Blue's death. The couple worked lovingly to remove changes by an intervening 
owner and restore the home to its original state. 
</P>
<P>
A picture in the Los Angeles Times in 1980 triggered a flood of international 
coverage, she said. "The Associated Press, United Press International and one 
other news service all came out that day, plus the ABC network news, which 
eventually ran it on 'Good Morning America,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared in newspapers and magazines everywhere. We received television 
interviews from Canada, New York and New Orleans. We had a Norwegian journalist 
come by to photograph it and do an article. The last show of 'Real People' 
photographed it and had a picnic on our roof. A Japanese network televised it 
for show there." 
</P>
<P>
The coverage continued over the years, Cowans said, until she and her husband 
moved to Woodland Hills and sold the property to Foulad for $900,000 earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cowans said she bought the property when her son was 4, as a home to raise a 
child in. 
</P>
<P>
But he is now 21 and "It was time to move on," she said. "We wanted to get into 
something smaller and easier to take care of." 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a great place. I was stunned when I went back and saw the 
fireplace changed. I couldn't understand how someone would take down that 
beautiful fireplace and replace it with marble. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want to get into a fight with the Foulads. It's their place now."

3 WOMEN KILLED, 2 INJURED AS SPEEDING CAR HITS A TREE 
</P>

What apparently began as a beach outing ended as a triple-fatal accident early 
Monday when a car carrying five young women -- who may have been speeding 
because they feared a car was following them -- spun out of control and flipped 
over the side of a freeway in West Los Angeles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the occupants -- including the driver, 19-year-old Ruby Garcia of La 
Puente -- were killed instantly when the car hit a tree. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth woman sustained massive injuries and was in critical condition at UCLA 
Medical Center. The fifth woman -- Raquel Cornejo, 19, of South-Central Los 
Angeles -- suffered a broken leg. A UCLA spokeswoman said she was in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol investigators said the accident was unusually deadly, 
especially with all the victims in one car. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very unusual, to have a triple fatal," Officer Tad Yamashita said. 
"It's not something that occurs every day. Our normal accident out here is a 
rear-ending." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they do not know where the women were going or why they were 
traveling on the Santa Monica Freeway at speeds close to 80 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cornejo's mother, Oralia Geron, said her daughter told her she was 
going to the beach with friends Sunday afternoon. Geron, who spoke with her 
daughter briefly in the UCLA emergency room after the accident, said Raquel 
told her the women were speeding because they believed they were being followed 
and feared that the occupants of the car behind them might shoot at them. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't know if it is a man or a woman," Geron said of the driver of the 
car that was reportedly following the young women. "But she's afraid, because 
of what has happened too many times," Geron added in reference to shootings and 
other random violence on area freeways. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CHP, the women were driving a 1980 Toyota east in the fast 
lane near the Overland Boulevard exit about 12:20 a.m. when they came upon 
another car and tried to swerve around it. Instead, the Toyota clipped the 
other car, whose occupants were not injured. Garcia lost control and the car 
crossed all lanes of traffic, hit the curb on the side of the freeway and went 
airborne. 
</P>
<P>
"It rolled several times," CHP Officer Dwight McDonald said. "And it came to 
rest wrapped around a tree." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said it took paramedics 90 minutes to extricate Cornejo from the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Further information was unavailable, in part part because authorities were 
unable to interview the two survivors. A CHP spokesman said officials were 
unable to determine the identity of two of the five victims: one of the dead 
women and the woman who was critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the third dead woman was not released. However Cornejo's 
mother, interviewed at the hospital as she waited for her daughter to recover 
from surgery, said that woman had a husband and two young children -- a 
6-year-old boy and a 3-year-old daughter.

IS TOPANGA READY FOR SOUP LINES?; 
</P>
<P>
POVERTY: AFTER A YEARLONG CRACKDOWN ON THE HOMELESS IN THE AREA, ONE GROUP IS 
TRYING TO HELP BY PROVIDING FOOD AND OTHER SERVICES. 
</P>

<P>
It was morning in Topanga Canyon. Fog lifted from the mountains as steam rose 
from a large pot of chili. Several dozen day laborers stood in line, waiting 
for a free breakfast of hot soup, bread and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the quiet scene was interrupted by shouts from a passing truck. The 
driver's words weren't entirely clear -- something about "them" -- but his tone 
obviously was one of anger. Volunteers Marg Starbuck and Susan Lovell looked at 
each other, shook their heads and kept passing out the food. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wait for government to take care of them, we'll wait forever," said 
Lovell, a movement therapist who has lived in the canyon on and off since 1965. 
Lovell recently joined a group known as PATCH -- People Assisting Topanga 
Canyon's Homeless -- which was formed several months ago to help day laborers 
and any other local homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
As the presence of day laborers persists in Topanga Canyon, the approximately 
9,000 residents remain divided on whether to embrace, shun or simply tolerate 
them. In recent weeks, however, after a year of stepped-up sheriff's patrols 
and immigration raids that defied the community's bohemian reputation, Topanga 
seems to have shifted back to its liberal roots. 
</P>
<P>
One group of volunteers cooks and serves soup every weekday morning. Another 
holds English classes. Still another is hoping to establish a hiring center. 
</P>
<P>
Most are working under the auspices of PATCH. Members said they formed PATCH in 
response to suggestions that residents boycott day laborers and turn them in to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us feel very strongly that these people are a part of our community," 
said Maryana Kuretski, a family therapist. "We are using them. There are a lot 
of jobs up here, mainly in construction, and it is our obligation to integrate 
them." 
</P>
<P>
For journalist Flavia Potenza, who moved to Topanga 15 years ago from New York 
City, the day laborer debate also signifies the canyon's gentrification as 
property values increase and a more conventional crowd moves in. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't yell at you about your dogs anymore. They sue you," Potenza 
said. "The funkiness of the canyon has gotten cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
For the last six weeks or so, every weekday morning, as many as 50 men have 
gathered near the corner of Topanga Canyon and Old Topanga Canyon roads for the 
homemade soup. Starbuck, an artist, picks up groceries donated by Topanga and 
Santa Monica markets and passes them out to a network of cooks, who take turns 
serving their creations from the backs of the trucks and vans. 
</P>
<P>
The food is served between 9:15 and 9:30 on the theory that those who have 
gotten work for the day have already been picked up. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, the laborers eating breakfast said Topanga Canyon is 
popular among them because of generous wages -- $5 or $6 an hour compared with 
an average of $4 an hour elsewhere in the city -- in addition to its friendly 
residents and, now, its soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's real helpful and demonstrates that the American people -- as I've 
always believed and been told -- are very humanitarian," said farmer Thomas 
Carnales, 42, who said he left El Salvador after his 16-year-old son was killed 
by guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Some canyon homeowners remain concerned about day laborers camping in 
drought-stricken hills and now fear that PATCH may inadvertently contribute to 
the risk of fire. 
</P>
<P>
"What I fear is that it's going to encourage them to live in the brush in 
Topanga," said filmmaker David Gottlieb, a Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource 
Conservation District board member who specializes in fire prevention.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEVELOPER SCRAPS HIDDEN HILLS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The builder behind a controversial development proposal that would have brought 
lower-cost housing to wealthy Hidden Hills said Monday that the project is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Howard of H.H. Lasher Road Ltd. said his option to buy the 25-acre 
property has expired because the Hidden Hills City Council has not made a final 
decision on the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said his contract with landowners Jon Galiher and William Maingot 
required him to obtain final council approval by early May. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal called for nine luxury homes to be built on 21 acres that were to 
have been incorporated into the exclusive gated community and connected to its 
private road network. Howard had wanted to build commercial properties, 
including a five-story office building and a 48-unit apartment building for 
low- and moderate-income senior citizens, on the four acres that would have 
remained outside the city's gates. 
</P>
<P>
"It means it's dead," Howard said of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Howard had asked the City Council to expedite a decision on the project last 
week. The council, however, approved only the single-family residential portion 
of the project. Council members said they were not ready to take further action 
because they had too many unanswered questions about the rest of the project's 
environmental effects. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would continue to seek financial damages in a lawsuit he filed 
against the city late last year.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN '83 BURBANK SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two people arrested in recent weeks in connection with a 1983 
drug-related slaying in Burbank pleaded not guilty to murder Monday at an 
arraignment in Burbank Municipal Court, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman R. Nixon, 50, of San Jose was arrested Saturday at his home on a warrant 
charging him with the Sept. 27, 1983, killing of 29-year-old Humberto Varela, 
who was found shot to death in his home in the 1100 block of North Frederic 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford Green, 41, of Spokane, Wash., was arrested April 27 and has been 
charged with murder, Burbank police said. Green is fighting extradition from 
Washington to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Varela's slaying remained an unsolved mystery until earlier 
this year, when an unidentified witness offered information. 
</P>
<P>
"A witness came forward and made life a lot easier for us," said Los Angeles 
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Cohen. "It was a witness who knew information 
about the slaying." 
</P>
<P>
Though authorities said they have enough evidence to charge the suspects, the 
exact details of what led to Varela's death are not known. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there were drugs involved, but we are not sure what happened," Cohen 
said. "The investigation is continuing." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Don Goldberg, a spokesman for the Police Department, declined to comment 
on the motive for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if Nixon and Green were residents of Burbank at the time of 
the killing, Goldberg said.

WASHINGTON IRVING BRANCH LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your April 27 editorial, "The Little Library That Could": 
</P>
<P>
Do we need an expensive community center? No. Do we need a larger, full-service 
library? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
The option of expanding the current Washington Irving branch library was 
somehow overlooked by your staff. A large number in our community have voiced 
their desire to retain the current library facility and expand it to meet the 
required service standards. Expansion is the only clear solution. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no convincing argument made in support of relocation. If there 
is a compelling argument to be made for relocation, make it. But next time, 
make it before you advocate the misuse of public monies or the abandonment of a 
64-year-old library.

WASHINGTON IRVING BRANCH LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patt Morrison's excellent article on the Los Angeles Central Library (Part A, 
April 30) recalls the countless hours I had spent at this fine citadel of 
learning since the summer of 1955! 
</P>
<P>
How I cherish the memories of this sedate, academic building where I read and 
studied for pleasure and school, with emphasis on The Times on microfilm from 
1881 to present day, the stereo music section and the voluminous nonfiction 
books. . . . and on occasion I'd even browse through the telephone directories 
of the United States and the entire world! 
</P>
<P>
Since grammar school I've always held libraries in high esteem as an 
escape/haven from TV and the routine of life, with the Central Library as my 
personal favorite. Let's hope that bureaucracy and red tape will not interfere 
with its reopening.

ROGUE COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Kissinger, in his article "Joining Germanys" (Opinion, April 15), states 
that "a system of collective security has historically proved useless against 
the biggest threat to peace -- a major rogue country." He then asks, "How could 
such a system avoid all the frustrations of the United Nations and the League 
of Nations?" 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger overlooks the reasons for the frustrations of the United Nations. 
Former Secretary General U Thant once said: "The ultimate crisis before the 
United Nations is the crisis of authority, and nations are reluctant to give to 
the United Nations the authority it needs." 
</P>
<P>
Possible first steps to restructure the U.N. with the authority it needs would 
be (1) to create an international verification system (as proposed by the Six 
Nation Initiative) to verify compliance with arms- reduction agreements; (2) to 
establish a U.N. peacekeeping reserve of earmarked national contingents (as 
proposed by President Carter), and (3) to create an international criminal 
court (as proposed by 14 Caribbean nations) to try individuals accused of 
transnational drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev, to his credit, appears to be open to or supportive of all 
three initiatives. Kissinger, instead of bewailing the "frustrations" of the 
U.N., should urge President Bush to support these steps. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, balance of power politics as advocated by Kissinger has never 
achieved a lasting peace. Nor can a weak U.N. Only a world federation, able to 
enforce world laws on individuals as well as major rogue countries, can do 
that.

FINALLY, THEY REMEMBERED THE PUEBLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A modest ceremony in San Diego the other day finally produced a small measure 
of recompense for one of the more conspicuously shameful episodes of post-World 
War II military injustice. Retired Comdr. Lloyd (Pete) Bucher and the crew 
members of the intelligence ship Pueblo were officially recognized as having 
been prisoners of war, 22 years after their capture by North Korea. The medals 
given the men had been specifically ordered by Congress, even though the Navy 
-- institutionally as self-protective as always in the Pueblo matter -- had 
fought to block them. 
</P>
<P>
The medals were not a gift, nor a courtesy, nor a favor. They had been paid for 
in blood, pain and humiliation over 335 days of brutal captivity. But the 
ordeal of the captain and crew of the Pueblo did not end when finally they were 
freed by their tormentors. Instead began a new ordeal, psychologically callous 
and morally unconscionable, which saw men who had heroically kept faith with 
their country and with themselves blamed forothers' failures. 
</P>
<P>
For what the Navy tried to do was hold Bucher and some in his crew almost 
solely at fault for the seizure of the Pueblo, the loss of much of its secret 
equipment, even for their own suffering. Yet, as the record soon revealed, the 
Navy had only itself to blame for what occurred. The onus for its capture fell 
not on the Pueblo, but on those in higher authority whose unforgiveable 
succession of near-criminal blunders had placed the ship in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
The Pueblo, an old World War II Army cargo carrier, was not the vessel to send 
on a spying mission in the international waters off North Korea. Badly 
outfitted, it could neither fight nor run from attackers and lacked even the 
means to prevent its secret equipment from falling into enemy hands. Bucher had 
spotted these deficiencies before the Pueblo sailed. His requests to have them 
remedied were repeatedly turned down. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969 a Navy court of inquiry, eager to blame an individual and so spare the 
institution, recommended that Bucher be tried, among other things for failure 
to resist the seizure of his ship. The Navy secretary wisely ruled that no 
disciplinary action would be taken against any member of the Pueblo's crew. 
Yet, for 21 years, the official Navy attitude -- scapegoating Bucher and his 
men -- remained unchanged. Now amends of a sort have been made, official 
apologies have been tendered. Far too late, and with utter inadequacy, the crew 
of the Pueblo has at long last been welcomed home.

Ask a class for the definition of the word cowardice, and I supply the answer: 
The Times' editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
The April 27 editorial asks "Want to Be Held Hostage Again?" But in the 
cowardly reply, you say not a single word about either increased domestic 
production or more nuclear power. Either or both of these will most certainly 
reduce our scary future, but you are afraid to mention either for fear of 
offending certain people. 
</P>
<P>
Shame. How can you claim to speak for all the people when you permit the 
calamity howlers (and I do mean howl) to deter you from speaking honestly?

Is it that tough to be honest?

On a quiet side street in South Central Los Angeles, there is a tumbledown 
church used on Sundays by a spiritualist preacher. A half-starved, mangy bitch 
covered in fungus has tunneled under the church and, in its unseen safety, is 
nursing a litter of puppies. Life against the odds; life in our time. 
</P>
<P>
Margarita Jackson lives next door to this church, in the house where her 
husband grew up. He remembers his grandfather on the broad front porch -- the 
parlor for company only, as it still is. It creaks and moves like a ship, but 
it is a beautiful old house. That it was derelict for years, until Elmer won it 
back from his stepmother's heirs, has been slowly disguised. 
</P>
<P>
A rooster scratches in the back yard, chased by the big family dog. Birds chirp 
in cages on the back stoop. The sounds come softly into the house. Light 
filters through drawn curtains. It is a harbor, a haven, a still point in the 
turning world. An organ stands in the parlor; charcoal-sketch portraits hang by 
photographs of children, formally dressed, posing with solemn dignity for the 
occasion. The photographs are of the Jacksons' children: Jose Israel, 15; Ramon 
Lawrence, 12; Sandy, 8. The sketches are Elmer's, drawn from memory, of his 
grandfather and mother. 
</P>
<P>
Elmer is 58, a post-office mechanic, small, wiry, eager to please. Margarita is 
34, slow, graceful, with the confidence of a woman who has always been 
beautiful and who, besides, raised six younger brothers and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Days and nights pass in the quiet house. The Jacksons never go anywhere without 
the children, but they stay home mostly. They try to be in by 8. Gangs on the 
corner, violence and fear a block away. The blood-dimmed tide is loosed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Israel and Lawrence are at a dangerous age: old enough to see the 
contradictions. Their mother's brother is going home: "I do not like to be 
Mexican in America," he says curtly. If they are American-born, American-easy, 
they are also old-fashioned: polite, respectful, careful of their mother. 
Israel is at a Catholic school: $150 a month. Elmer brings home less than $500 
a week. Margarita is unruffled: "I know how to handle my money. I have 
something for everything." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence and Sandy are at public school, San Pedro Street School, 1,200 
children on a busy street, where gates have to be padlocked and guards alert. 
Education, says Margarita, is the key. She left school at 16. "My father, he 
listened to his mother too much and she says girls don't need to go to school." 
Her English is still uncertain; her skills, but for sewing, self-taught. 
</P>
<P>
She could trust the school system, believe that "teacher knows best." She knows 
better. She believes that a child is safe only when the family watches over it. 
She swallowed nervousness and started to go into the school: English lessons 
during school hours, computer lessons afterward with Lawrence. She worked in 
the classroom as an aide when called, ferried other children in and out, took 
over as president of the PTA, is a member of the new Local School Leadership 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
When she sees trouble, she pays attention. Because she is mild, soft-spoken, 
people forget how closely she listens. Most teachers smile and stop when they 
see her; a few -- young, officious, condescending -- cut her. "Here in 
America," she shrugs "lots of people get hurt in their heart because of racism. 
But the same person can be mean one day and nice another." 
</P>
<P>
She simply does not acknowledge that her children could go wrong. She sees all 
-- gangs, prejudice, crack. They have no place in that warm, safe spot she has 
made around her. "Watching very carefully, the family being very close, growing 
the best you can together -- it is all you can do that is important in life." 
</P>
<P>
Few, much richer, have her elegance. Her talk is always of what she has ("My 
husband is a courteous, gentle, good man -- how lucky I am"), never of what has 
been taken, or not offered in the first place. "Maybe people today are too 
ambitious, too greedy? I remember my father used to say, ambition is the ruin 
of a human being." 
</P>
<P>
And generosity is the making of one.

AREA VOTES FOR GATES AS CRIME DETERRENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to turn the Baldwin Hills Estates into a gated community was given 
overwhelming support in a community election that attracted slightly more than 
half of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Hills Estates Homeowners Assn. proposed the gates as a means of 
deterring vandals, burglars and the curious who have taken to wandering into 
the isolated hillside community since a fire devastated much of the area five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by a vote of 423 to 121 last week. The vote represented 
slightly more than 50% of the 957 households in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It means that the community is concerned about our security, our lifestyle and 
the value of our homes," said Joseph Gardner, the association's president. "It 
is a very positive vote." 
</P>
<P>
Approval from the Los Angeles City Council is needed for the plan, however, and 
that could prove a problem. Ruth Galanter, the council member who represents 
the area, said she does not support the proposal in its present form. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, seven electronic gates will be used to cut off vehicle and 
pedestrian access to the community. Residents will be able to operate the gates 
with a device similar to a garage-door opener and by phone from their homes to 
let in visitors. Police, fire and other city services will be given secret 
codes to open the gates. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected to cost an estimated $225,000 to install the gates, about $225 
per household, Gardner said. Annual maintenance costs have not yet been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously going to need the participation of the residents for the 
gates to be built, but the vote is a strong indication that we will get it," 
Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to install the gates has been under discussion since the community 
was hit by an arson fire on June 2, 1985, which destroyed 53 homes, damaged 13 
others and killed three people. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter questioned the plan, saying that communities seeking to become gated 
should be prepared to assume responsibility for maintaining other city 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is owned by the public and maintained by the public, then the public 
should be able to use it," she said. "The question really is how much financial 
burden can the city be expected to shoulder for an area that is not available 
to all city residents." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner said the association plans to meet with Galanter to work out any 
differences. If that cannot be done, he added, the association will go 
elsewhere for support. "We certainly hope to have her support but if we have 
to, we will go directly to the City Council for approval," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said the council will not support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are asking for the public to maintain private streets, no one on the 
council will swallow that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The association's plans call for two gates at the intersection of Don Miguel 
and Don Lorenzo drives. Other gates will be located at Don Lorenzo near Don 
Porfirio Place; Don Quixote Drive near Don Tomaso Drive; Don Miguel near Don 
Tomaso; Don Felipe Drive near Marlton Avenue, and Hillcrest Drive near Don 
Ricardo Drive.

JAIL DEAL STILL HUNG UP ON FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Council members Monday authorized leasing city-owned land on 
Otay Mesa to the county for construction of a 200-bed misdemeanor detention 
facility, but the city has yet to settle the nettlesome question of how to pay 
for the much-needed jail. 
</P>
<P>
The city had hoped to win a low-cost loan or a grant from Gov. George 
Deukmejian. But, so far, the only offer from Sacramento is an 8% loan that 
"would cost more than what we can get" elsewhere, said City Manager John Witt. 
"It just doesn't make sense to borrow at 8%," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the $12-million loan would pay for construction and operating 
costs of the jail that would house people who have been arrested for, but not 
yet arraigned on, misdemeanor charges. The lease authorization was needed 
because the jail, which would be built and operated by Florida-based Wackenhut 
Corp., eventually would be turned into a county-owned jail. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who in early April announced that a state loan would be 
available, argued Monday that the state should drop its demand for interest 
payments because "that money belongs to the taxpayers." Borrowing from the 
state at an 8% interest rate "makes no sense," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor's stance clashes with a decision by State Department of Finance 
Director Jesse Huff, according to David Takashima, an aide in Assemblyman Steve 
Peace's office. Peace (D-Chula Vista) had agreed to carry legislation in 
Sacramento that would authorize the loan. 
</P>
<P>
That legislation is on hold because Huff maintains that Deukemejian "can't loan 
money at zero interest," Takashima said. "Clearly the governor's position is 
that it's going to be a loan, not a grant, because a grant would be a gift of 
state money to the city of San Diego," Takashima said. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and other members of the San Diego delegation in Sacramento are waiting 
for the city to decide if it will seek a loan at 8% or lower, Takashima said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the possibility of grant or a state loan at an acceptable interest 
rate seems bleak, the council intends to move ahead with construction of the 
jail, Witt said. The council will incorporate funding of the jail while 
deliberating the city budget for the upcoming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The impasse with the state also raises the question of what the city should 
fund with borrowed money, said Councilman Ron Roberts. While borrowing is 
appropriate to cover capital costs associated with the new building, Roberts 
said, he questioned the use of borrowed money for operating costs that should 
be included in the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
The council Monday authorized the city manager to execute a ground lease with 
the county for 10 years at $1 a year.

THE NICKNAME PLOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just received my sample ballot for the upcoming (June 5) election. In 
reviewing the various candidates I note that entirely too many of them have 
cute little nicknames in parentheses. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is old-fashioned to run for public office using your proper name. 
</P>
<P>
If the individuals in question were known better by the nickname it might be 
acceptable. However, in most cases the individuals have simply included the 
common informal name, i.e., Robert -- "Bob" or John -- "Jack." If this is a 
current ploy to win elections, I, for one, will not fall for it. 
</P>
<P>
If these individuals really think this will help voter recognition, I question 
their intelligence. I will vote for the "less cute" candidate and/or the one 
with the less placards attached to utility poles.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE BLEW THE WHISTLE ON EVERYONE IN LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He may be the Earl of Hoops. This is the last season for NBA referee Earl 
Strom, 61, who has grown into the role of the most beloved whistle-toter in the 
league, outlasting a somewhat cantankerous past. Like the time Downtown Freddy 
Brown's wife slugged him with her purse as he came off the court after a game. 
Strom wrested the purse from Mrs. Brown and hit her right back. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Strom's career is winding down, he says one of the things he will miss 
most is his give-and-take with the fans. The fans gave him heck and Strom took 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that stuff and I really will miss it," Strom said. "It's always fun. My 
last trip to Indiana was fun. A fan threw a beer at me." 
</P>
<P>
So? 
</P>
<P>
"He missed," Strom said. "He hit Isiah Thomas instead." 
</P>
<P>
A word, please?: Chris Evert and Jimmy Connors are trading their rackets for 
NBC-TV microphones during the French Open and Wimbledon, and Evert is wondering 
if they'll get turned down asking players for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"When we played, we'd say 'no' every so often," Evert said. "Now, we'll have to 
pick the right ones, so we won't be jilted." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Question: Who is "The Dunkin' Dutchman"? 
</P>
<P>
What do you really think? Rick Bozich of the Louisville Courier-Journal doesn't 
sound as though he is a big fan of former Florida center Dwayne Schintzius, who 
showed up at an NBA tryout camp 30 pounds overweight. Said Bozich: "Schintzius 
is fat, lazy, inconsistent and a chronic complainer." Yeah, but maybe he's 
consistently lazy. 
</P>
<P>
Tall story: How tall is 7-foot-6 Shawn Bradley of Castle Dale, Utah, a Brigham 
Young recruit? Bradley can mount a horse by merely stepping aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Said the world's tallest cowboy: "We don't have any saddles long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Get Cronkite on the phone: From Monte Poole of the Oakland Tribune, speculating 
on who will succeed Brent Musburger at CBS: 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Nantz? CBS Sports President Neal Pilson evidently likes Nantz, who is a 
nice man though a bit simple. Greg Gumbel? He takes himself half as seriously 
as his driven brother but is about half as talented." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Rik Smits of the Indiana Pacers, who was born in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Money matters: From Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe on Michael Jordan: 
"Jordan this year will earn approximately $15 million from residuals off Nike. 
That's apart from his Nike salary and stock. And let's not forget his NBA 
salary (about $2.3 million)." 
</P>
<P>
Remember this quote: The Cavaliers' John (Hot Rod) Williams is in his 
free-agent year and he says he isn't worried about what Danny Ferry might make 
next year: "If Danny Ferry gets more than me, it won't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
4 BR W VU: In Denver, they're talking about rebuilding the Nuggets after they 
didn't pan out against San Antonio. The Nuggets were swept in the first round 
by San Antonio. Alex English is almost certainly gone at age 35, so too may be 
Joe Barry Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
Even Fat Lever is deemed expendable, but trade talks do not seem to upset him. 
Lever told Ailene Voisin of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution that there is 
a bright spot if he actually is traded from Denver. "It might be a blessing 
because the house we're living in is too small," Lever said. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: From pro golfer Bryan Tennyson, explaining why his wife, Jeanne, no 
longer caddies for him: "In the U.S. Open in 1987, I was grinding to make the 
cut and turned an easy par into a bogey. She glared at me and said, 'You're 
choking, you're choking.' So I fired her."

Jennifer Capriati's European debut was short and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in front of Italian relatives and a crowd that has adopted her as its 
own, the 14-year-old American overwhelmed qualifier Leona Laskova of 
Czechoslovakia, 6-0, 6-3, Monday in the first round of the Italian Open. 
</P>
<P>
The match, played on the red clay of the Foro Italico center court, lasted only 
50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It was an easy workout for the 12th-seeded Capriati, who has reached two finals 
in three tournaments and moved to No. 25 in the world rankings since turning 
pro in March. 
</P>
<P>
Laskova, ranked No. 143 in the world, was always on the defensive, as Capriati 
cracked forehand and backhand winners from the backcourt. The eighth-grader 
also showed no hesitation in coming to the net, often charging in for putaway 
volleys and smashes. 
</P>
<P>
In the only other matches involving seeded players, No. 9 Laura Gildemeister of 
Peru beat Nicole Provis of Australia, 6-2, 7-5, and No. 12 Helen Kelesi of 
Canada defeated Jo-An Faull of Australia, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>

Unseeded American Lori McNeil lost to Czechoslovakia's Radka Zrubakova, 7-6

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PINTO SLOWS HER PACE TO REGAIN WINNING FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patience has never been one of Martha Pinto's virtues. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto, a Katella High School junior, generally believed that the harder and 
faster she ran in practice, the better she would do in competition. But like 
many runners who overdo, Pinto was more often hurt than healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, she suffered a hip injury during the cross-country season that 
slowed her training to a near-shuffle. While she managed to advance as far as 
the state cross-country championships, Pinto finished 14th in that race, an 
impressive performance considering the circumstances, but not the season-capper 
for which she had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Katella Coach Mike Cochrane said that after the cross-country season, he sat 
Pinto down and discussed the importance of rest and proper diet, and was 
convinced that Pinto would change her ways. But after watching her tire in the 
latter portion of a 3,200-meter race in the Arcadia Invitational in April, 
Cochrane was perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't understand why she was so tired," Cochrane said. "Then we found 
out she'd been running in the morning with some kids, and one of their fathers 
had been really working them, making them run hard quarters (quarter-mile 
repeats) . . . We put an end to that." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Pinto, The Times' athlete of the week, has performed tremendously. 
Thursday, she won the 3,200 and the 1,600 at the Empire League finals. In the 
3,200, the first race, Pinto ran virtually alone the entire distance, breaking 
Cypress' Rhonda Craig's 11-year-old meet record of 11:00.24 with a career-best 
and county-leading 10:57.98. Later that afternoon, Pinto turned in one of the 
most exciting performances of the season by outracing her league rival, Los 
Alamitos' Tracy Fatone, to win the 1,600 in another career best, 5:10.76. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Pinto had always been outkicked by Fatone. Last week, the two were 
side by side with 300 meters to go, but when Fatone started to pass Pinto, 
Pinto hung on and came back in the final 50 yards to edge Fatone at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking, 'Oh, she's going to pass me at the end again like always,' " 
said Pinto, who is 4-foot-9 and 103 pounds. "But I just started to try (to 
kick) again, and somehow I caught her. I think I just had a lot of energy. I 
don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS

THE PREPS: MIRA COSTA CAN PROVE IT'S BEST EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever the phrase best ever is used in connection with a high school team, it 
is usually met with some skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
But when comparisons are made with this season's Manhattan Beach Mira Costa 
High boys' volleyball team, it is difficult to argue that this Mustang team is 
not the best ever. 
</P>
<P>
In a sport that has been dominated by Southern California teams over the years, 
Mira Costa's 18-0 record speaks for itself as the Mustangs head into the 
Southern Section playoffs, which will begin with wild-card play Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs are the top-rated team in the nation, after finishing 21-1 and 
Southern Section 4-A Division runner-up last season. 
</P>
<P>
They have five college Division I prospects on the team -- four seniors who 
have committed to volleyball at major college powers next season and a junior 
who most likely will do the same in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six starting Mustangs are taller than 6 feet 3 inches, and the two 
players who split time in the final starting position could star on most prep 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, two of the Mustangs started on U.S. Olympic Festival teams, which 
are composed mostly of college starters. 
</P>
<P>
In its only tournament this season, Mira Costa breezed through a strong 29-team 
field and won its own Redondo-Mira Costa Varsity Classic two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the first time, this year's team defeated Mira Costa's alumni team, 
which is made up of many established professional players. 
</P>
<P>
"If we win it all, yes, this would have to be considered as one of the best 
teams ever," Coach Mike Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
In Cook's 10 years at the school, he has won either Ocean or Bay League 
championships in all but one season. The Mustangs won the Southern Section 4-A 
title in 1984, and finished second in 1987 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"This is physically the most talented team I have ever had," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for Mira Costa is 6-4 senior setter Canyon Ceman, who will 
attend Stanford next fall. Ceman, who also played basketball for Mira Costa, 
has a 4.0 grade-point average and was a finalist for the state's 
scholar-athlete award. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very strong with great leg strength," Cook said of Ceman, who started on 
the gold-medal winning West team in last summer's U.S. Olympic Festival. "He 
has such a wonderful future and the funny thing is, the guy he beat out to 
start in the Olympic Festival is Stanford's starting setter now." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Ceman is 6-4 UCLA-bound David Swatik, who was a first-team All Southern 
Section selection last season. 
</P>
<P>
Swatik, a powerful outside hitter who started for the bronze-medal winning 
North team in the Olympic Festival, was the most valuable player in the 
Redondo-Mira Costa tournament with 50 kills in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Pat Ivie, a 6-5 middle blocker, is the vocal leader of the Mustangs. His 
brother, Bryan, a 1987 Mira Costa graduate, was MVP of USC's recent NCAA 
tournament championship victory last Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very good competitive athlete," Cook said of the younger Ivie. "He is 
just fundamentally sound." 
</P>
<P>
Ivie, who will attend USC with his brother next season, may be the Mustangs' 
best all-around player. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't give out accolades easy, but all three could be on the '92 Olympic 
team," Cook said of Ceman, Swatik and Ivie. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the Mustangs' list of talented players is senior Mike Ashenfelter, a 
6-7 middle blocker and power server, who has also committed to USC. 
</P>
<P>
Ashenfelter is the Mustangs' most improved player and best server despite his 
size. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike couldn't even spike as a freshman but he has gotten more and more 
coordination each year," Cook said. "He has a great serve where he uses his 
height to his advantage. He serves bullets, like a baseball pitcher's 
curveball." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Shoptaw, a 6-3 junior outside hitter, is the Mustangs' star for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Colleges are already after him and rightfully so because he is a fine player," 
Cook said. Two seniors, 5-11 Brian Thurston and 5-10 Craig Beck, share the 
Mustangs' final starting position. 
</P>
<P>
"They both would be starters for anybody else," Cook said. "Thurston has a lot 
of spring and Beck is our best defensive player." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his team's rave reviews, Cook is concerned about upsets in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are beatable," he said. "If we are out of sync and not playing well, 
anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Mustangs lost to Corona del Mar in the Southern Sectional 
final. 
</P>
<P>
"But, they do have a chance to be 22-0 and become a very special team, like the 
undefeated '84 team," Cook said of the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Kym Weil of Newhall Hart broke the Southern Section record for softball 
victories with her 82nd last week, a 1-0 eight-inning triumph over San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Weil, a senior who has a 21-1 record this season, broke the old mark of 81 set 
last season by DeDe Weiman of Gahr. 
</P>
<P>
After missing most of the outdoor track season with injuries, Hawthorne 
sprinters Chris Alexander and Erik Allen made their comebacks in the Bay League 
finals last week. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who will attend UCLA on a football scholarship in the fall, won the 
100 meters with a wind-aided time of 10.86 seconds and ran third in the 200 
with a time of 22.2. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a junior, finished third in the 100 with a time of 11.10 and second in 
the 200 in 22.1. 
</P>
<P>
Both runners will be needed if Hawthorne is to successfully defend its boys' 
state team title June 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the Northern League meet, Napoleon Kaufman of Lompoc was impressive in 
winning the 100 in a wind-aided 10.3 and the 100 in 21.1. He also had a winning 
long jump of 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Green of Long Beach Poly was almost as impressive in the Moore League 
meet. A senior, he won the 100 in 10.6 and the 200 in 21.1.

BRUINS ICE CAPITALS AGAIN, 4-1; 
</P>
<P>
NHL PLAYOFFS: BOSTON TAKES 3-0 LEAD IN STANLEY CUP SEMIFINALS.

<P>
The Boston Bruins came looking not for a split on the road, but a sweep. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins pushed the punchless Washington Capitals to the brink of playoff 
elimination Monday night with a 4-1 victory that gave Boston a 3-0 lead in the 
Stanley Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Game 4 is Wednesday at the Capital Centre. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a real big game," Boston's Dave Christian said. "It's much easier 
being up, 3-0, than 2-1. We have all the momentum now." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Janney, Randy Burridge and Cam Neely each had a goal and an assist and 
Andy Moog turned aside 25 shots to put Boston within reach of its first playoff 
sweep since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, it was Boston's defense that made the difference. In a streak that 
began in the opening game of the series, the Bruins held Washington without a 
goal for 117 minutes before John Druce scored his playoff-best 14th goal at 
15:23 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always talked about being aggressive defensively, just staying on your 
checks and not giving them anything," Burridge said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give a good player time, he'll make the play. If you don't give a 
player any time, he's not going to make as great a play. We didn't give them 
any time to make any plays." 
</P>
<P>
Moog, 11-3 in the playoffs, kept his postseason goals-against average under 
2.00. Washington, which has been without injured scoring leader Dino 
Ciccarelli, has been held scoreless in six of the last seven periods. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense is really working hard at being there, either at getting the puck 
or taking the man," Moog said. "I think we worked hard at discipline for 80 
games, so it's not like it's something we had to turn on for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
After Druce's goal tied the score, Janney quickly retaliated by taking a pass 
from Neely in the slot and blasting a slap shot over the right shoulder of 
Capital goalie Don Beaupre at 18:08. 
</P>
<P>
Burridge provided the Bruins with an insurance goal midway through the final 
period on assists from Janney and Ray Bourque, and Neely added an empty-net 
score with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been done a couple of times, but it's a very difficult situation for us," 
Washington Coach Terry Murray said. "I thought at certain times we had some 
real good opportunities, but the power play didn't work for us." 
</P>
<P>
Washington was one for six in extra-man situations. 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive game, the Bruins scored first. With Washington's Nick 
Kypreos in the penalty box, Christian took a backhand centering pass from 
Burridge in front of the net and put a low shot between Beaupre's pads at 6:53 
of the opening period.

West Coast Bancorp: The Orange-based bank holding company reported earnings of 
$376,000, down 22% from the $481,000 recorded for the quarter the year before. 
</P>
<P>
John B. Joseph, chairman and chief executive, attributed the drop to an 
increase in the company's provision for possible credit losses and a decrease 
in the company's net-interest margin. Total assets were up 13% from a year ago, 
to $467.8 million from $415.5 million. West Coast Bancorp subsidiaries are 
Sunwest Bank and Heritage Thrift &amp; Loan in Orange County and Sacramento

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The divergence between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broad U.S. 
stock market seems to be narrowing, said Irving Katz, director of research at 
Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Many stocks have moved up in tandem with the Dow index, which has risen six 
consecutive days and is only off 3% from its all-time high, reached Jan. 2 of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed gained $1.625 for the week. At its annual meeting last week, chief 
executive Robert Adelizzi pointed out that HomeFed finished the most turbulent 
decade in the history of the savings-and-loan industry with its most profitable 
year ever in 1989 and its best first quarter ever for the period ended March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed stock is selling at a little over five times earnings, at a 35% 
discount to tangible book value, and "remains a buy in my eyes," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Buffet's increase in his investment in PS Group to 11% of the shares 
outstanding made the stock the largest point mover of the week, gaining $3 to 
$37. Most of PS Group's shares are held by value-oriented investment managers 
who invest for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Other solid gains were posted this past week by Rohr Industries, up $2; San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric, up $1.50; BSD Bancorp, up $1.25, and Cubic Corp., up 
$2.25. 
</P>
<P>
Great American Bank continued its descent, giving up another $.50 to $2.75 as 
the proxy statement and 13-D filings showed that Ed Wedbush, the S&amp;Ls 
largest shareholder, sold about 800,000 shares during the last month. The 
question remains whether the sale was because of a loss of faith by Wedbush or 
a forced liquidation related to margin calls. 
</P>
<P>
Triton Group Ltd. continued to drop and fell $1.125, to a new low of $7.875. 
Its proposed merger with Intermark would entitle owners of one Triton share to 
1.4 shares of Intermark, which closed Monday at $7.625. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the downside, Magma Power dropped $1.50 and Price Co. dropped $1.25. 
Price fell to a new low of $32.50, at which point it is selling at 11 times 
next year's consensus earnings forecast of $2.93 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Marketing Services hit a new low of $4 when it announced that it would 
have a loss of 15 cents a share for its fourth fiscal quarter, resulting in 
earnings for the fiscal year ending March 31 of 30 cents a share.

HOUSE SALES INCREASE 12% IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
April sales of single-family houses in the San Fernando Valley rose 12% from 
March but remained 31% below the sales pace of a year earlier, the San Fernando 
Valley Board of Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively high prices and a record inventory of 12,501 houses and condominiums 
listed for sale put downward pressure on sales last month, the board said. 
Sales also have slowed contrasted with last year's because of the recent 
increase in mortgage interest rates. Rates on conventional fixed-rate mortgages 
have climbed about a full percentage point so far this year and now range from 
10.5% to 11.25% in the region. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 824 single-family houses were sold, up from 739 in March but down 
from 1,202 in April, 1989, the board said. The average house price last month 
was $303,100, which slipped 1% from $307,100 in March but remained 5% above the 
$289,700 average price of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of condominiums, meanwhile, totaled 338 in April, which was down 1% from 
the 341 sold in March and 16% below the 402 condominiums sold in April, 1989. 
The average condominium price was $149,800 last month, down 4% from a record 
$156,500 in March but 7% above the $140,500 average of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the soft market, more and more homeowners are putting their properties 
on the market. The record listing of properties for sale in April was up 7% 
from 11,682 in March and 53% more than the 8,179 listed a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never seen an influx of new listings like we're seeing now," Jim Link, 
the board's executive vice president, said in a statement. "It can create the 
illusion that nothing is selling, but buyers are merely taking their time, 
picking the best and negotiating until the price fits the property." 
</P>
<P>
As for the sellers, Link contended that "for the past several months I think 
we've seen owners cling to unrealistic price expectations," which has 
contributed to the slower sales pace. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the most expensive part of the region in April was the southwest 
portion of the Valley, including Canoga Park and Woodland Hills, where the 
average price of a single-family house was $355,620 and 180 houses were sold. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest region for sales was the southeast portion, which includes Studio 
City and North Hollywood, where 230 houses were sold at an average price of 
$302,600.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: G.I. INDUSTRIES SELLS SOME HOLDINGS TO REDUCE DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
G.I. Industries, continuing a restructuring plan to pare its operating losses 
and debt, said it sold about 40% of its lease portfolio and some real estate 
that enabled the Simi Valley company to cut its long-term debt by $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
G.I. is primarily a rubbish collector for about 40,000 customers in Ventura and 
Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
The company diversified in the late 1980s into areas such as equipment leasing, 
but it is now shedding many of those assets after suffering losses. 
</P>
<P>
In its latest transaction, G.I. said it sold about 40% of its lease receivables 
-- lease payments due the company -- mainly to ITT Corp. Terms were not 
disclosed. G.I. also sold unidentified real estate holdings for $775,000, the 
company said.

A STORY OF BIOLOGY, BUT NOT OF LIVES; 
</P>
<P>
TOWARD THE HABIT OF TRUTH: A LIFE IN SCIENCE BY MAHLON HOAGLAND W. W. NORTON 
$19.95, 206 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At base, we are all storytellers, and we all tell -- or try to tell -- a 
coherent story of our lives. It is the story dearest to each of us, though it 
takes a bit of doing. We have to downplay some things and embellish others. But 
we all walk around with a Story, the Story. We tell it to ourselves, and 
sometimes we tell it to others. 
</P>
<P>
Of necessity, everyone's story is different. From the moment of birth we all 
have different experiences and lead different lives. 
</P>
<P>
But there are patterns of stories that recur, one of which is the dedicated 
scientist doing research to expand knowledge and help people. In fiction, it is 
the story of Sinclair Lewis' "Arrowsmith." In nonfiction, it is Paul de Kruif's 
"Microbe Hunters." In autobiography there are many examples, the latest of 
which is Mahlon Hoagland's "Toward the Habit of Truth," the book we take up 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Hoagland is one of the major figures in the unfolding of microbiology. After 
Watson and Crick discovered the form and structure of DNA -- the molecular 
basis of heredity -- Hoagland and a colleague discovered transfer RNA, the 
mechanism by which DNA creates a new living being. DNA contains the blueprint. 
Transfer RNA converts the blueprint into a specific individual. 
</P>
<P>
In describing this work, which was carried out at the Worcester Foundation for 
Experimental Biology, Hoagland tells the story of science and scientists and of 
his own role in the biological enterprise that stretches unbroken from Charles 
Darwin to the present day. Hoagland writes: 
</P>
<P>
"The story of man's rapidly expanding understanding of his origins is one of 
the greatest sagas of human creativity -- of the use of imagination in the 
rigorous pursuit of evidence -- to bring connection, continuity and community 
to a bewildering mass of data. Explanation has brought harmony, pattern, 
meaning and beauty in its wake." 
</P>
<P>
Hoagland's story is interesting enough, and he writes with precision and grace, 
focusing on the big picture and the small details -- and the interplay between 
them. As in all lives, chance played no small part in his. While in medical 
school in the mid-1940s, Hoagland came down with a severe case of tuberculosis, 
which took two years to overcome. When he resumed his studies, he found he 
could no longer perform surgery, his first interest, and he turned his 
attention to research. 
</P>
<P>
Along the same lines, Hoagland's book is understandably studded with 
observations about the edifice of science and its practice as well as with 
parenthetical asides that are no less revealing. 
</P>
<P>
A large observation: "Science is a process, a progression, because its 
discoveries are cumulative, the stones of an edifice under construction. While 
science gives us reliable knowledge about the external world, it cannot do much 
directly to solve the problems of values that press upon us in our daily lives 
that have no objective solution. This should not preclude the use in our daily 
lives of the scientific habit of skepticism, its esteem for evidence, its 
awareness of how hard it is to get at the truth, its insistence on 
distinguishing between testable hypothesis and belief." An orthodox plea for 
the scientific method. 
</P>
<P>
A small observation: "I have known several scientists whose encyclopedic 
knowledge seemed to impede, mask or substitute for whatever creative potential 
they might have had. Their ability to act -- and science is action -- was 
impeded by their erudition. They seemed to be weighed down by a sense that 
everything had already been done." There are nonscientists as well as 
scientists like that. 
</P>
<P>
Hoagland's book is fine as far as it goes, but if there is any caveat about it, 
it is that it does not go far enough. His relationship with his father, Hudson 
Hoagland, a distinguished scientist in his own right and the founder of the 
Worcester Foundation, is not sufficiently explored.

Hoagland tells us that only 21 years separated them and that sometimes his 
father was more like an older brother, but the complexities of the relationship 
are only alluded to. He refers to an "awkward, self-conscious competitiveness" 
between them and the "parent-child duel" that characterized their lives. I'd 
have liked more. 
</P>
<P>
In the genre of scientific autobiography, Hoagland tells a great deal. Readers 
interested in important microbiology and how it is done will be well rewarded. 
Those interested in a deep personal story may not.

THE MYSTIQUE OF 'PHANTOM'; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: THE SHOW'S STILL A FEAST AS GUILLAUME TAKES CONTROL. 
</P>

Those who've harbored concerns that "The Phantom of the Opera" minus Michael 
Crawford might be a banquet without a main course can set aside their fears. A 
glance Sunday at Crawford's replacement -- Robert Guillaume -- gave every 
indication that the feast may have shifted somewhat, but that it does go on. 
</P>
<P>
And a feast it is. The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, less than a month away from 
celebrating its first year in Los Angeles, is in rip-roaring shape: a 
sumptuous, smooth-as-silk super-spectacle. Graceful leading lady Dale Kristien 
is now several cuts above her own opening night performance as Christine Daae, 
object of the Phantom's obsessions, while Reece Holland, as her suitor Raoul, 
is in equally emancipated form and voice. 
</P>
<P>
The confidence of this well-practiced cast can only have created a welcoming 
crucible for the newcomer, Guillaume. The role of the lonely, disfigured man 
behind the mask can't be measured in terms of minutes on stage, which are 
surprisingly few but intensely demanding. Yet at the end of his first week in 
Los Angeles, Guillaume was clearly in growing control of the part, if just as 
clearly still in the process of making it his. After all, the Michaelmania that 
accompanied Crawford's last weeks in the show had to be a tough act to follow. 
But Guillaume is doing the only sensible thing: He is becoming his own monster. 
</P>
<P>
This naturally entails a slightly different slant. So far, the body language is 
less dependent on a limber sexuality and graceful gestures of the hands. This 
is a gruffer monster. Pitch and tonality are angrier, the hands more stressed. 
His rage is both more palpable and more concealed. Only in the final scenes, 
when all is lost, and after the compassionate Christine has shown the Phantom 
the affection no one had ever before proffered, does Guillaume allow the 
humanity to finally break through. 
</P>
<P>
This may shift some as the performance grows (and we shall pay another visit at 
a later date to note the changes). It's a gestation that is developing almost 
before our eyes -- from a certain bristling severity in the earlier scenes to a 
full-blown vulnerability and resignation of the soul in the concluding ones. 
What is never in doubt -- and Sunday's audience seemed instinctively to know 
this -- is that Guillaume is mastering his Phantom. 
</P>
<P>
After all, as a show this is a thumping-good fairy-tale on the grandest scale, 
a trip through Fantasyland that's akin to entering a sort of Disneyland for 
adults. It is furthermore a consummate act of techno-prestidigitation that 
relies as much on the versatility of Maria Bjornson's magnificent sets and 
costumes, Andrew Bridges' light tricks and Hal Prince's inventive direction, as 
it does on the undeniable skill of the players. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that it is all splendidly executed to the soaring strains of Lloyd 
Webber's instantly hummable melodies conspires to enhance "The Phantom's" 
phenomenal and unprecedented popularity with the public. It floats on a magic 
all its own that has nothing or little to do with depth or content, which are 
beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
Notably, no one at Sunday's packed matinee was overheard bemoaning Crawford's 
departure, and the thundering ovation that greeted Guillaume at the curtain 
call only confirmed that it's the show and not the actor -- masked and buried 
as he is under an inch of make-up -- that the mystique of "Phantom" is about. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford happened to be the first one to create the role -- and handsomely. But 
to Sunday's crowd, Guillaume was every bit as thrilling as his predecessor. 
Whatever the differences, they simply didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ahmanson, 135 N. Grand Ave., Tuesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
matinees Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Indefinitely. $32.50-$50; 
(800) 762-7666.

A GAROUSTE SPECTACLE IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The French are fabled for being good at a lot of things, from gastronomy to 
romance, but we don't always think of them excelling at spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, one need search memory no further than the musical "Les Miserables" 
to recall that in fact they do the spectacular with particular panache. The 
first thing that strikes home about about Gerard Garouste's exhibition at the 
Santa Monica Museum of Art is that it looks like a stage set in search of 
script. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is a script. Never mind that the ensemble of paintings, 
watercolors and sculpture is titled "Les Indiennes" -- that's a reference to 
the way Garouste makes his painting, by staining color directly into 
burlap-colored canvas, rather the way they do madras or tie-dye in India. The 
real inspiration is Dante's "The Human Comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Truth to tell, you could look at the work forever and not figure that out. It 
is its sense of theatrical spectacle that comes across most assertively. The 
largest piece is a huge horizontal canvas draped like Gulliver's pup-tent. It 
must be 50 feet long, but its size is more impressive than what's on it. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is a three-sided enclosure made of hanging banners that goes up 
nearly 30 feet to the ceiling. Here we begin to get a sense of what's on 
Garouste's mind. The whole feels architectural. Enigmatic imagery suggests a 
baroque building with painted lunettes surrounded by whipped-cream plaster 
reliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, so that's it. Garouste's real subject is history and the way it haunts the 
modern European mind. Fairly familiar. Remember back in the '50s when the 
Abstract Expressionist Georges Mathieu painted wearing greaves while page boys 
recited from books of ancestral lineage? 
</P>
<P>
Garouste's imagery looks like a surreal nightmare visiting itself on one of the 
three Musketeers. Root-like figures prance through scenes that remind you of 
Picasso or Wilfredo Lamm and run into a lumpy shape that could be the severed 
head of Rene Descartes. Garouste's abstract swirls bear a suspicious 
resemblance to elaborate Renaissance furniture carving. Every time he tries to 
make it into the modern world, his basic talent as a set designer asserts 
itself, he gets a bit too graphic and everything winds up as an entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Spectacular though. (Santa Monica Museum of Art, 2437 Main St.; to June 3.) 
</P>
<P>
A Cultural Stew: History is also on the mind of David Salle, one of New York's 
leading paint stars. Anyway, he was last year. Generically described, his 
latest batch of pictures all have backgrounds that resemble mythical Baroque or 
lyric Rococo compositions of the particularly schlocky sort one finds 
translated onto swap-meet tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
Into these, he inserts his usual motifs: sketchy furniture, comic-strip 
figures, empty talk-balloons and rectangles containing approximately realistic 
images. A woman drinking from a glass shows up a couple of times and somehow 
you know she is taking something for a headache this big -- almost certainly an 
overdose. Another recurrent actor is a contemporary guy in a commedia dell'arte 
jester's costume seen clutching his genitals. 
</P>
<P>
Some themes are familiar to Salle's art: urban alienation and sexual obsession. 
These works play up life's present cacophonous cultural stew by throwing in 
images of primitive art along with the rest. Salle's work seems disconsolate 
with its look of having accidentally been tossed into a Laundromat washer. 
Older examples blended a certain romanticism with callow postures of cynicism. 
This group -- and some works on paper -- seem to want to say that Old Master 
art at least had some energy, but that would seem nostalgic, so it's made fun 
of too, winding up more firmly calloused than ever. (Fred Hoffman Gallery, 912 
Colorado Ave., Santa Monica; to May 14.) 
</P>
<P>
Back to Basics: Mike Todd's studio blew up in a gas explosion back in the '70s, 
destroying both his current work and the tools to make more. Needing something 
to do, the sculptor took to fashioning simple works from bits of wire and then 
doing drawings from the results. 
</P>
<P>
A large gaggle of these on view in a big 75-work show give giggling insight 
into the creative process. Few suggest subject matter, but the animal's head 
fashioned from a cloud of steel wool and two copper scouring pads is a charming 
variant on Picasso's horned bicycle seat. Most are whimsical doodles that show 
how much mileage an inventive artist can get from bits of screening, bamboo 
sticks, rubber tubing and whatever else is in the rubble heap. 
</P>
<P>
Todd's full-dress abstract sculpture used to be rather Zen-solemn with its big 
universal circles, but it keeps getting crazier -- to its profit. Here "Shift" 
rises from a writhing lizard-skin form supporting a metal grille, takes off 
again with an upright blob of bronze and ends with an open occult triangle. 
From one angle, the triangle seems to float on air. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the work is metaphorically about the alternating insanity and 
rationality needed to make the creative process work. It's a technical and 
spiritual balancing act that comes clear in "Pirumania" -- a hoop-juggle 
without the juggler. 
</P>
<P>
The show caps off with a group of drawings of flowers, some of which are 
dedicated to Todd's art-world friends who have died, such as Nick Wilder and 
Eva Hesse. (Tortue Gallery, 2917 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica; to May 26.) 
</P>
<P>
'Round and 'Round: Over the years, even some of Billy Al Bengston's staunchest 
admirers have wished he'd take his own gifts a little more seriously. Now he 
has and they are liable to wish he'd stayed flip. 
</P>
<P>
Eight large new paintings depict circles that appear to be planets and bear 
titles like "Osorkon" and "Smenkarka." These galactic basketballs are firmly 
seen through interlaced bands of pure color that are too wide to be laser beams 
and too angled to be window mullions. They do give Bengston a chance to show 
off his flawless sense of decorative color and remind us that these are, after 
all, abstract compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he can't duck the suggestions of his imagery, all of which are serious, 
from their intimations of space travel to ecological blight to metaphysical 
breakdown of the system. There is both ancient religion and millennial fear in 
"Cheops." 
</P>
<P>
The paintings are brought off with accustomed brio but beneath it lurks turgid 
indecision. The circles are painted with thick textures that approximate 
planetary surface features, but the forms hang like inert bowling balls. 
Bengston has found maturity but he doesn't quite know what to do with it. Not 
yet. 
</P>
<P>

BIG KITCHEN DISHES UP RIGHT RECIPE

<TEXT>
<P>
Handled deftly, the one-act play can be like a short story or a lyric poem: a 
brief tapestry of words just long enough to create a mood, stimulate a feeling 
or stab into one's consciousness. One word and one gesture longer and the mood 
is spoiled. The proper delivery requires an understanding of minimalism that is 
all too rare in a medium in which show business and theater are so often 
intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
The concept, too, that less is more, is unusual in a country where bigger is so 
often mistaken for better. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Kitchen Dessert Theatre has understood perfectly the concept of less is 
more from its inception, with the modestly produced "Conversations in Exile" 
and "Counting the Ways." It continues what one hopes (if San Diego is lucky) 
will become a tradition with two one-act plays, "Drowning" by Maria Irene 
Fornes and "Striptease" by Slawomir Mrozek. 
</P>
<P>
Both works are short, the whole program is only 75 minutes -- and one wouldn't 
want them any longer. "Drowning" sets up two men, Roe (Eric Grischkat) and Pea 
(Kevin O'Neill), sitting at the Big Kitchen counter, drinking coffee. We see at 
once that they are different from the rest of us; they wear brown nylon masks 
over their faces stuffed in the cheek area to look like warts. Their hands are 
covered with the brown nylon in such a way that they look webbed. 
</P>
<P>
The older man, Roe, who is reading a newspaper, accepts himself as he is. The 
younger one, Pea, is puzzled and disturbed as to why he looks the way he does. 
He sees a picture of a beautiful girl in Roe's newspaper, and Pea longs for 
her, agonizing even further about his appearance. Director Binnur Karaevli 
doesn't tell us if these people walked out of a science fiction sketch or if 
they are outsiders, aliens or just anyone who feels shut out, for reasons they 
can't understand, from their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
What is conveyed through these two fine actors is a musical delivery of 
poignancy and pain. O'Neill's yearning and frustration is palpable yet so 
finely drawn it pushes thought upward and outward rather than dragging it down. 
Grischkat's compassion and frustration that he cannot help his friend from 
"drowning" in his sorrow, is a complementary ache. 
</P>
<P>
With "Striptease," the viewers, after adjourning for a Big Kitchen dessert, 
move with this same team into another room of the Big Kitchen, for an 
existential pause. 
</P>
<P>
Now Grischkat and O'Neill, playing Mister 1 and Mister 2, are two identically 
dressed men with briefcases who have been waylaid in a room for reasons they 
don't understand by a mysterious "hand" (a giant hand held by a black-clothed 
and masked John Highkin who also has a cameo part in "Drowning"). 
</P>
<P>
Grischkat's response to the terror is to remain passive. If he doesn't try to 
open the door to escape he retains his inner freedom to choose or not choose 
escape. O'Neill's Mister 2 tries everything he can, racing for the doors (which 
suddenly lock against him), to hitting the floor with his shoe (which causes 
the hand to demand their shoes), to rolling up his pants legs and pretending to 
be a fisherman (which causes the hand to demand their pants). 
</P>
<P>
Are they hostages in Beirut? Are they Kafkaesque hostages in life? Prisoners of 
a government? Or prisoners of their own minds? Again, the play doesn't answer 
these questions, but like the good poem, with many overlays of meaning, it can 
and does touch all those possibilities at once. 
</P>
<P>
As for the production values, it may seem odd to praise lighting for its 
virtual non-existence. And a set for being no more than a bench in an already 
existing restaurant. But the continuing delight of these Big Kitchen shows is 
how they remind us of how little is needed to create theatrical magic. Some 
well chosen words, some fine acting and sensitive directing -- one doesn't need 
much more than this. Of course having some of the best desserts in town between 
the acts doesn't hurt either.

Once again, Touchstone Pictures' "Pretty Woman" romanced the weekend box office 
-- taking the No. 1 spot, with ticket sales of $6.8 million. In second place: 
New Line Cinema's "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," with $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Turtles have now cracked the $100-million club. Among new entries, 
Paramount Pictures' "Tales From the Darkside: The Movie," scared up $5 million 
-- for third place. Another new entry, the 20th Century Fox comedy, "Short 
Time," starring Dabney Coleman, earned $1.2 million for 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
* In limited release at 13 theaters, Cinecom's "Last Exit to Brooklyn" -- based 
on the controversial 1964 novel -- had ticket sales of $186,489 for a high 
per-screen average of $14,345. MGM/UA's "Daddy's Dyin' . . . Who's Got the 
Will?" had ticket sales of $313,844 at 150 theaters.

BERLIN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA PERFORMS AT SEGERSTROM HALL 
</P>

<P>
Having delivered an unusual, primarily post-Romantic program at Pasadena's 
Ambassador Auditorium Thursday, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra on Sunday 
brought to the Orange County Performing Arts Center another all-orchestral, 
Romantic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ambassador, conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy offered the indulgent banality 
of Scriabin's Third Symphony. At Segerstrom Hall, he gave us the indulgent 
glory of Strauss' "Also Sprach Zarathustra." As on Thursday, the orchestra 
played boldly, loudly and sometimes imperfectly. Precision of attacks does not 
appear to be one of Ashkenazy's top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
But intensity, excitement and drama are high on the conductor's list, and his 
high-voltage reading of Strauss' lofty Nietzschean tone poem certainly bore 
that out. Ashkenazy has in this orchestra a sturdy, energized brass section, 
percussionists who rarely pull punches and, most remarkably, a string choir 
that penetrates with Brobdingnagian strength. As a result, key moments in the 
work exploded with vigor; the most climactic of these proved earth-shattering. 
</P>
<P>
This was not simply an aggressive, cataclysmic performance, however. Ashkenazy, 
finishing up his first year as principal conductor of the Berlin ensemble, 
brought out telling details with striking clarity. The various woodwind 
soloists played with great sensitivity, and concertmaster Hans Maile delivered 
his extended solos with confidence and style. 
</P>
<P>
Though "Also Sprach Zarathustra" was composed only 20 years after Brahms' First 
Symphony, few musicians would claim that the two works should receive the same 
treatment. Yet Ashkenazy's Brahms proved nearly as extroverted -- and often 
nearly as loud -- as his Strauss. To be sure, he brought spellbinding 
excitement and unforgettable power to the familiar score. Yet much of the 
dramatic impact was lost by virtue of the sheer muscularity of the playing. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the music-making, while by no means flawless, was first-class. All of 
the players seemed to play as if their lives (not their livelihood) depended on 
it. But they played with such constant force that the work did not take on any 
real shape. Thus, to give the finale's coda the importance it needed, Ashkenazy 
had to coax his players to play with such headlong abandon that the listener 
felt as if he were sitting a few feet under a rapidly moving elevated train.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
THE PICTURE-PERFECT PLACE TO STAGE CHAMBER CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an effort to make the San Diego Museum of Art a more enticing destination, 
curator of education Barney Malesky has launched an ambitious program of 
monthly chamber concerts. Supported by a grant from the Masserini Charitable 
Trust, Malesky's programming over the next year will include traditional 
chamber ensembles, jazz groups, and silent films accompanied by the San Diego 
Cine-Phonic Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Malesky has booked the Arioso Wind Quintet for three concerts on the museum's 
series, which to date is nameless. In their opening program April 29 in the 
museum's second-floor Baroque Gallery, Arioso offered a selection of Baroque 
music and 20th-Century compositions inspired by Baroque models. Performing Jan 
Sweelinck's Theme and Variations with Massimo Stanzioni's 
</P>
<P>
"David With Sword" hanging behind the oboist's shoulder allowed listeners to 
contemplate the aesthetic connections between Sweelinck and Stanzioni, who were 
contemporaries. During Arioso's spirited quintet version of Mozart's Overture 
to "The Magic Flute," it was possible to compare Mozart's style with the 
Classicism of Simon Vouet's "Aeneus and his Father Fleeing Troy," another of 
the gallery's paintings that framed the musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Arioso's next museum concert will be an all-American program at 7 p.m. May 17 
in the Copley Auditorium. The ensemble will return to the Baroque Gallery on 
June 10 at 1 p.m. with a contemporary potpourri, including a composition by 
Arioso's horn virtuoso John Lorge. 
</P>
<P>
Other May musical offerings include a screening this Saturday at 7 p.m. of the 
1926 silent film classic "The Phantom of the Opera" with the Cine-Phonic 
Orchestra; the Westwind Brass will play on May 20 at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
For the summer months, Malesky is planning a jazz series, including free early 
evening concerts in front of the museum's main entrance. 
</P>
<P>
More Previn promises. For the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's SummerFest '89, 
Andre Previn was the popular annual festival's conspicuous no-show. Apparently 
completely recovered from his tendinitis, the former music director of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic intents to do penance for slighting the La Jollans last 
year. He will grace three SummerFest '90 (Aug. 17-28) concerts and will appear 
in several musical guises. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Previn will mount the podium Aug. 26 in UC San Diego's Mandeville 
Auditorium to lead members of the San Diego Symphony in Mozart's Sinfonia 
Concertante, K. 364. On the Aug. 25 program in Sherwood Auditorium, Previn will 
star as SummerFest's composer-in-residence, accompanying flutist Carol Wincenc 
in his "Peaches for Flute" and mezzo-soprano Christine Cairns in his "Six Songs 
on Poems by Philip Larkin." On Aug. 27 in Sherwood Auditorium pianist Previn 
will provide the keyboard parts to Mozart's Piano Quartets in G minor and 
E-flat Major. 
</P>
<P>
SummerFest is not, however, just a PrevinFest. Pianist Emanuel Ax will make his 
festival debut in a pair of programs, the Aug. 17 opening concert and again 
Aug. 19. Other musicians making their first SummerFest appearance include 
cellist Carter Brey, pianist Andre Michel Schub, violinist Young Uck Kim, 
flutist Anne Diener Giles and newly appointed San Diego Symphony principal horn 
John Lorge. Returning artists include pianist David Golub, cellist Gary 
Hoffman, violist Cynthia Phelps, violinist Cho-Liang Lin, bassoonist Dennis 
Michel, and the Colorado String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Six concerts will be given in Sherwood Auditorium, and both Sunday programs 
(Aug. 26) will occur in UCSD's Mandeville Auditorium. Other traditional 
SummerFest features include the young people's afternoon concert and ice cream 
social at Sherwood Auditorium (Aug. 19), open rehearsals, master classes, and a 
private concert in Rancho Santa Fe for festival supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxing under pressure. Four public seminars on the Alexander Technique will 
be offered by the music and drama departments of San Diego State University on 
Wednesday and Thursday. Marjorie Barstow, a student of F. Matthias Alexander, 
the founder of a method to eliminate habits that cause excess strain, tension 
and effort in performance, will teach the courses. The music department offers 
regular classes in the Alexander Technique, taught by Eileen Troberman, who 
apprenticed with Barstow. For information about Barstow's offerings at SDSU, 
phone the music office (594-6031). 
</P>
<P>
More winners. Mezzo-soprano Lisa Friedrichs won first prize ($3,000) in the 
vocal division in the annual Virginia Hawk Competition for aspiring young 
musicians in El Cajon on April 21. Soprano Diane Winterton placed second 
($1,000). In the instrumental division, first-place winners ($1,000 each) were 
violinist Pengfei Xhou, pianist George Estrada and oboist Vicki Strong. 
Instrumentalists taking second prizes ($500 each) were violinist David Chan, 
pianist Arlene Hipolito, and bassoonist Michael Curtis. These winners were 
presented in concert May 6 at El Cajon's Neighborhood Center. 
</P>
<P>
That's all, folks! Los Angeles theater organist Gaylord Carter will make his 
farewell appearance on the California Theatre's mighty Wurlitzer on Sunday at 2 
p.m. With the imminent demolition of the historic building, the local Theatre 
Organ Society has slated only three more programs, including the grand finale 
on June 24. Carter, who is remembered by old-timers for providing the opening 
and closing theme music to the 1930's "Amos 'n' Andy" radio programs, will 
accompany two Harold Lloyd films, "Hot Water" (1924) and "For Heaven's Sake" 
(1926).

MOMIX WARHORSES AT SADDLEBACK COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Momix, the 10-year-old company of dance illusionists, is starting to look like 
Mo-formula. In a bill full of warhorses from their 1975-88 repertory Saturday 
at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, repeated motifs made a once-innovative 
style seem as tired as the dancers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Like artistic director Moses Pendleton's first company, Pilobolus, Momix 
combines fantasy themes, strange beasts and large props together with an 
athletic if unspectacular modern-dance vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
Among the familiar works, the interludes that held up best were the ones with 
few or no props: "Kiss Off Spider Woman" (1986), an authoritative solo 
featuring a game Beth Starosta; Cynthia Quinn's gestural "Bird in My Dreams" 
(1987); and "Alruane" (1975), a seemingly Indian-inspired duet in which Karl 
Baumann and Starosta interacted so well it was difficult to tell which limbs 
belonged to which dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Boeding's "Circle Walker" (1983), a duet for the 
choreographer-dancer-sculptor and a large, rolling metal device, was cramped on 
the mid-size stage, but managed nonetheless to suggest human turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"Spawning" (1986), on the other hand, a nature parable in which three nearly 
naked women (Lisa Giobbi, Quinn and Starosta) danced with huge balloons between 
their legs, was riddled with formulaic movement. 
</P>
<P>
Other gimmick dances -- such as "Venus Envy" (1986), with its two women inside 
a giant clam shell, or the life-size partner puppet of Quinn's "When We're 
Alone" (1988) -- remained no more than visual one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Last and perhaps least, for those who like high-tech shadow puppets, there was 
Momix's sign-off, "E. C." (1982), an extended scrim and strobe routine, heavy 
on the cute and more than a little dated. JAN BRESLAUER

WAILING TURBANS EXPLORE SEX, LOVE AT CAFE LARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a presentation that's part vaudeville, part performance art and part rock 
opera, Weba and the Wailing Turbans boldly went where no Caucasian trio dressed 
in Moorish outfits have gone before, Thursday night at Cafe Largo. Entitled 
"Adventure Amour," their zany new revue examining sex in the universe, the 
meaning of love and an unrelenting Arab motif, tickled and teased, winning over 
spectators gathered at the Hollywood cabaret. 
</P>
<P>
The charismatic, central chanteuse -- Weba Garretson -- crooned out sexy lyrics 
while striking an innumerable amount of titillating poses. Her two endearingly 
dullard sidekicks -- Weba's brother, John Garretson, and new member Jeff Oetjen 
-- mugged and strutted, lending support with monosyllabic grunts, purposely 
banal choruses or an occasional strum or blat on a musical instrument or two. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to be specific about why this balancing act of ultra-female and 
ultra-male persona works as sophisticatedly well as it does. The formulaic rock 
songs by Weba and composer Steve Stewart -- with titles such as "Creamy 
Dressing Man" and "Love Pimple" -- hold little value out of context. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the overall low-budget production by Garretson's real-life husband, Mark 
Wheaton, makes intelligent use of props and a simple sound system with which 
the ensemble sings to prerecorded music. Cartoonish, pseudo-Persian tapestries 
by Sarah Todd Garretson (sister-in-law) fittingly serve as backdrops while a 
slide show with similarly styled artwork and credits bring a 
TV-situation-comedy flavor to the event. GREGG WAGER

'FRONTLINE' EXPLORES BLACK MARKET IN ANTIQUITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Plunder!," airing on "Frontline" tonight (9 p.m., Channels 28 and 15; 10 p.m., 
Channel 50), poses one of the art world's stickiest questions: Who owns a 
nation's cultural heritage? The nation that produced it and may have abused it, 
or foreigners who take the treasure out of context and reap great profits from 
it but sometimes take better care of the art than the country of origin? 
</P>
<P>
"Frontline" argues in favor of the country of origin but presents an evenhanded 
view of the problem. Investigating the international black market in 
antiquities, "Plunder!" focuses on smuggling from graves of the Lords of Sipan 
in Peru. The story involves Southern California dealers and collectors who were 
subjects of a massive U.S. Customs raid in 1988. One dealer, David Swetnam, a 
young adventurer who operated a gallery in Santa Barbara, recently completed a 
six-month sentence at the federal prison camp in Boron. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed before his incarceration, Swetnam argues that Peru was so lax in 
enforcing its export laws that he didn't take them seriously. New York dealer 
Andre Emmerichtakes this position further, contending that the United States is 
not obligated to enforce the export restrictions of other countries. In the 
case of Sipan, that contention no longer holds up. President Bush on Monday 
announced that, effective May 7, pre-Columbian artifacts from Sipan will be 
barred from entry into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Sipan tale of high drama involves one death and national outrage, but it 
reaches its high point in interviews: "The one who loves the baby best gets the 
baby. The one who will pay the most for the baby gets the baby. If Peru cannot 
properly take care of its national treasures, the rest of the world will take 
care of it for the Peruvians, as it should be," Emmerich says, taking a 
patriarchal dealer's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
But he's no match for Fernando Cabiezas, head of Peru's National Institute of 
Culture, who counters, "There's a mafia . . . selling Peruvian artifacts in the 
United States and in Europe for profit. . . . There's a tremendous amount of 
money going into this. This is prostitution. Like it or not, this is crime." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers in search of a more complete and colorful version of the Sipan story 
will find it in an article by "Frontline" reporter Carl Naginin the May issue 
of Art &amp; Antiques magazine.

AIR-CONDITIONING COMPANIES FEEL THE HEAT AS YEAR'S 1ST HOT SPELL HITS; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: THE COUNTY MARKS ITS FIRST TRIPLE-DIGIT TEMPERATURES OF THE YEAR, AND 
OJAI HAS A POWER FAILURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The high in Ojai was 81 on Monday, almost a cold snap from the 100-plus 
readings over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But air-conditioning companies were just warming up for the rush of business 
caused by Ventura County's first hot spell of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're swamped with calls," said Barbara Kaderly, office manager for Temp-Co 
air systems. "We get a hot spell, and then it really takes off." 
</P>
<P>
She said her company had 17 service orders, from customers in Ojai, Santa 
Paula, Camarillo, Fillmore and Ventura. Other companies were just as busy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great for business," said Pat Grove, office manager for Air Conditioning 
Co. Inc. "The phone's been ringing off the hook since we came in at 7." 
</P>
<P>
He said the company, based in Glendale, had 200 orders for service by 2 p.m. 
Monday, including about 40 from Ventura County, all commercial users. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually it's lack of maintenance," Grove said. "The coils get dirty and don't 
dissipate heat like they should. Or the system limped along last year and the 
first hot spell, it blows." 
</P>
<P>
The weekend heat wave marked the first time this year that temperatures in the 
triple digits were recorded in Ventura County. The National Weather Service's 
official high Saturday in Ojai was 100, recorded at the county Fire 
Department's Station 21. The thermometer at the HomeFed Bank on Maricopa 
Highway recorded 105. 
</P>
<P>
Similar highs were noted during the weekend in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and 
other inland areas, but in Ventura and Oxnard and elsewhere along the coast, it 
was just a bit warmer than usual. On Saturday and Sunday, for example, the high 
in Ventura was 79, more than 20 degrees cooler than Ojai, even though the towns 
are only 12 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists and other officials say such big differences are normal in 
Ventura County, where desert winds collide with onshore breezes and the 
protective marine cloud layer bumps into the mountains. On March 20, for 
example, the high was 90 in Ojai but reached only the upper 60s along the 
Ventura County coast. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're inland, without that marine layer as a filter, you get more direct 
sun and hotter temperatures," said Bill Wright, land-fire officer for the 
Ventura County Fire Department. Mountains block the marine layer and humid air 
off the ocean. That's why it's usually warmer in Camarillo than in nearby 
Oxnard, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"The farther you get away from the coastal influence, the higher the 
probability of brush fires," Wright said, but the county reported no brush 
fires over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Another hot-weather phenomenon -- the power outage -- did occur in the Ojai 
area, where 1,793 customers lost power for more than an hour Sunday evening 
when overhead equipment failed. But Southern California Edison spokesman Mike 
Montoya said investigators do not believe that the heat was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the hottest days were Saturday and Sunday, when most factories 
and businesses were closed, so the system was not burdened by the surge in air 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Today's forecast calls for a high of about 75 in Ojai and inland areas and 70 
in Ventura and along the coast. But Robert Laszlo, owner of California Air 
Conditioning in Ojai, will still be feeling the heat wave's glow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm booked solid through Thursday," Laszlo said.

COLUMBIA S&amp;L PAID OFFICERS $4 MILLION IN BONUSES; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: MANY EXECUTIVES WHO RECEIVED THE PAY HAVE ALREADY LEFT THE TROUBLED 
COMPANY.

Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, the troubled Beverly Hills thrift that lost $591.1 
million last year and is now insolvent, paid its top executives $4 million in 
bonuses last year, according to public documents filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The information on the 17 current or former top Columbia executives -- who 
received a total of $9.5 million in compensation, including the bonuses -- is 
contained in the thrift's annual proxy statement filed with the federal Office 
of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure could prove sticky for Columbia executives, who are scrambling 
to save the thrift from a federal takeover amid a huge drop in the value of its 
risky junk bond portfolio. Indeed, many of the executives receiving the largest 
bonuses have left the firm within the past six months. Columbia executives 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, former Columbia Savings Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas 
Spiegel, the savings and loan industry's top-paid executive in 1985 when he 
earned $9 million, will earn $1 this year as a consultant in trying to help 
Columbia find a buyer for its junk bonds, the proxy statement says. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel was to have earned $500,000, the document shows, but thrift regulators 
objected to it. The proxy also discloses for the first time that Spiegel 
returned to Columbia last November $600,000 that he had received as part of his 
$4.1-million pay package in 1988 after regulators made it known they believed 
his compensation was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
The single largest amount paid by Columbia in 1989 went to Christopher S. 
Moore, an executive vice president in corporate finance who resigned two months 
ago. He received $1.35 million, including a $1.15-million bonus. Moore's job 
was to arrange financing deals for Columbia, a task that was effectively 
eliminated by last year's federal thrift reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence K. Fish, who resigned as president in August and now heads troubled 
Bank of New England, was second with $1.32 million, including an $820,000 lump 
sum he received when he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Former chief Spiegel earned $898,922 in salary and other compensation before 
resigning on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, whose largest shareholders are Spiegel and members of his family, 
suffered huge losses last year as the market for high-yield, high-risk junk 
bonds plunged. The thrift now is in danger of being seized by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Columbia disclosed that it lost an additional $293.3 million in the 
first quarter. The thrift now has a negative net worth of $215.6 million and is 
$338.3 million short of the money it needs to meet the government's most basic 
requirement of capital, which is the financial buffer it must maintain to 
protect against losses. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel's 1989 compensation included $750,000 in salary and $148,922 in other 
compensation, specified as tax accounting fees, use of an automobile, use of a 
corporate jet and a "transfer of certain art objects at appraised value." The 
amount, the proxy statement says, does not include $140,331 for life insurance 
premiums. Spiegel did not receive a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
The proxy statement does show that although Spiegel earns only $1 a year from 
Columbia now, he does receive $17,400 a month in office and other expenses as 
he works to help the S&amp;L divest its junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, what Spiegel received is dwarfed by what he earned in previous years. 
His $9 million earned in 1985, which included $5 million deferred to a special 
retirement fund, shook the S&amp;L business. Regulators objected, but later 
dropped their protest. He received packages worth $4.38 million in 1986 and 
$5.46 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
According to the proxy statement, Edward G. Harshfield, hired in March to 
replace Spiegel and try to save Columbia, will earn no less than $500,000 a 
year under his three-year agreement, but may earn more than $3 million in other 
bonuses, depending on his performance. The proxy statement also says that 
Harshfield is being allowed to continue as general partner of a Merrill 
Lynch-sponsored investment fund that he was affiliated with when hired by 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Other top-paid Columbia executives included James A. D'Aquila, who resigned as 
chief financial officer in January. He earned $810,000, including a $650,000 
bonus. And Kenneth R. Heitz, Columbia's top lawyer who filled in as interim 
chief executive earlier this year, earned $800,000, including a $450,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's 83-year-old patriarch, Abraham Spiegel, Thomas Spiegel's father, 
earned $500,000 in 1989. The proxy statement says that his pay agreement was 
suspended effective May 1 until Columbia is solvent again.

REGULATORS PUT A DAMPER ON BIG REAL ESTATE DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: OFFICIALS ARE OBJECTING TO THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS FOR LANDMARK 
LAND CO.'S PLAN TO SELL $967 MILLION WORTH OF ITS WELL-KNOWN RESORT PROPERTIES. 
</P>

<P>
Landmark Land Co. said late Monday that the deal to sell its major resort 
properties to Orange County developer Barry G. Hon for $967 million is in 
danger of falling through because banking regulators object to how the sale is 
being financed. 
</P>
<P>
Carmel-based Landmark, a leading developer of resort and golf course 
properties, said that regulators from the Office of Thrift Supervision have 
objected to the "credit concentration aspect" of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Though company officials and regulators were not available to elaborate, 
regulators apparently are objecting to the fact that a savings and loan 
subsidiary of Landmark Land, New Orleans-based Oak Tree Savings, was to finance 
the sale completely. The deal was announced only three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the sale called for Hon to put up $200 million, with Oak Tree Savings 
to finance the remaining amount. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was to take place in two stages and be completed by next year. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the sale are several well-known resorts in the Palm Springs area, 
including Mission Hills Country Club, PGA West and La Quinta Golf &amp; Tennis 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 19 golf courses and four resort hotels are to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree Savings owns the properties now, but it is being forced to sell as 
part of the S&amp;L industry bailout legislation last year that forced thrifts 
to get rid of their direct investments in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
In a terse statement, Landmark Land said it is trying to refinance the deal "so 
as to remove the (regulatory) objection." 
</P>
<P>
Landmark said the deal will be canceled if the problem cannot be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Hon is an increasingly high profile developer in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
His projects include the 2,750-acre Foothill Ranch, a master-planned community 
in south Orange County, and a proposed 850-acre development in Rancho Palos 
Verdes that would include a 450-acre Ritz Carlton Hotel and two golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Hon could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in Landmark Land's stock on the American Stock Exchange was suspended 
Monday pending the announcement.

'FREEDOM' CAMPAIGN UNDER SIEGE; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: ANTI-SMOKING ACTIVISTS PROTEST PHILIP MORRIS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
PROMOTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It gave the world the cowboy king of macho -- the Marlboro Man. Now, wearing a 
far different hat, tobacco giant Philip Morris is featuring prominent 
Americans, such as the head of the NAACP and the former president of the 
University of Notre Dame, in a controversial print ad campaign promoting the 
Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Today, ads with Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People, Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president 
emeritus of the University of Notre Dame and Judith Jamison, artistic director 
of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, will appear in a handful of national 
newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
The ads feature close-up photos of the noted personalities along with bold 
headlines that quote their personal feelings about the Bill of Rights. The ads 
are a continuation of Philip Morris's $30-million campaign to promote the 
upcoming 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The new campaign drew fire Monday from anti-smoking advocates who object to the 
notion of a tobacco company -- which encourages the sale of addictive 
cigarettes -- identifying itself with so powerful a symbol of freedom as the 
Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be humorous if it wasn't so pathetic," said John F. Bazhaf III, 
executive director of Action on Smoking and Health, a Washington-based 
anti-smoking lobby. "The Bill of Rights certainly doesn't need to be defended 
by the likes of Philip Morris. It's ironic that the manufacturer of the only 
legal product that enslaves most of its users is associating itself with 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Added Sidney Wolfe, executive director of the Washington-based consumer 
advocacy group Public Citizen Health Research Corp., "The whole campaign smears 
the Bill of Rights with the blood of those people who have died from smoking 
cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris officials deny that the ads, which do not include health 
warnings, promote smoking. "I think that's a completely unfair criticism," said 
Mary Taylor, director of special projects at Philip Morris. "I think most 
people took the campaign at face value." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the new campaign's leading figures said they were happy for the chance 
to affirm the Bill of Rights and strongly denied that they were supporting 
Philip Morris' tobacco products in any way. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could think that without having a wild imagination," said Notre Dame's 
Hesburgh, who spent 15 years as a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights. "I figured any way I can get a good word in for the Bill of Rights, 
that's fine." Hesburgh said he quit smoking -- after 25 years -- in 1970, 
"because I thought it was giving a bad example to my students." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more outspoken about his role in the ad campaign was Hooks. 
</P>
<P>
"If you really want to see my blood pressure rise, talk to me about the days 
when Philip Morris would run 100 ads and not include a black," said Hooks. 
"Finally, blacks are in ads and people want to know why we're in them. In this 
case, black people have always felt the Bill of Rights is important -- maybe 
even more important than the Constitution itself." 
</P>
<P>
Other spokespersons appearing in the new print campaign include actor Charlton 
Heston; former Vietnam prisoner of war Everett Alvarez Jr. and New York City 
Ballet principal dancer Valentina Kozlova. 
</P>
<P>
The spokespersons are paid an undisclosed amount for their efforts and some 
have donated their fees to charity, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks -- who smokes only on occasion -- said he has cut back from the two packs 
of cigarettes he used to smoke every day. He also said that Philip Morris 
donated $50,000 to the NAACP last year but that the contribution did not prompt 
him to appear in the latest campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we receive money from a corporation does not cause us to take 
action in support of them," he said. "If they're trying to buy respectability 
with this campaign, based on the number of calls I've received today, they may 
be wasting millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Cos. is by far the world's largest tobacco company. Although it 
also owns Kraft General Foods and Miller Brewing Co., the bulk of its 1989 
profit of $2.9 billion was derived from sales of tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
The company -- which is mailing out free copies of the Bill of Rights to those 
who dial a toll-free number -- said it has received 2.2 million requests for 
copies of the document in just six months. The requests mostly were prompted by 
the television campaign, which was launched last November. That campaign 
features striking visual glimpses of hallowed American institutions such as 
churches and courtrooms.

DECLINE IN FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES EXPECTED SOON; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: RATES HAVE RISEN A PERCENTAGE POINT SINCE CHRISTMAS TO THEIR 
CURRENT HIGH OF 11%. THEY MAY DROP TO 10.25% BY YEAR-END. 
</P>

<P>
Interest rates on fixed-rate home mortgages should soon end their recent steep 
climb and settle back well below 11% in the months ahead, real estate and 
housing economists believe. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate home loans -- by far the most popular loan with consumers because 
they provide for level payments every month -- have risen about a full 
percentage point since Christmas and are now approaching or have even surpassed 
11%, their highest level in nearly a year. That has been bad news for 
prospective home buyers and homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe, though, that these mortgage rates will rise another 
quarter of a percentage point at most before settling back below 11% and will 
end the year between 10.25% and 10.75%. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, housing economists are closely watching how investors -- 
those from Japan in particular -- will react to this week's expected sale of 
$30.5 billion in U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
The interest rates on those bonds have a direct impact on the rates that 
American consumers pay on their mortgages and illustrates the profound impact 
that Japanese investors have on U.S. homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The mortgage-rate increases of the past five months have hurt the U.S. housing 
market, cutting into new-home sales nationwide and retarding the pace of 
housing resales in California. The increases also make it harder for borrowers 
to qualify for home loans. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly principal and interest payments on a $175,000 loan total $1,666 when 
the interest rate is 11% versus $1,536 when it's 10%, according to figures from 
the California Assn. of Realtors. The median price of a resale house in 
California is now more than $196,000. 
</P>
<P>
A jump in mortgage rates from 10% to 11% also squeezes another 135,000 renters 
out of the housing market statewide, a spokeswoman for CAR estimated, adding 
that California has about 4.7 million renters. 
</P>
<P>
Rising mortgage rates are a key reason why housing sales in California are 
suffering this year, economists say. According to data released Monday by the 
California Assn. of Realtors, the pace of first-quarter sales of existing 
single-family homes ran at more than 13% below the torrid level in the first 
three months of 1989, although it was up 2.9% on an annualized basis from the 
fourth quarter of 1989. The realtors group said it expects that housing resales 
will drop 11% for all of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The sales of single-family homes nationwide have been falling for months, 
according to Commerce Department figures. The annual pace of new-home sales 
fell to 574,000 in March, below 1989 levels when sales were at their weakest 
pace in years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a recession year for real estate . . . and that includes California," 
said Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego for KPMG Peat 
Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
The news is also bad for consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages whose monthly 
payments vary according to a volatile index based on one-year Treasury notes. 
The more the index rises, the more their monthly home-loan payments rise. 
</P>
<P>
One large savings and loan based in Los Angeles, California Federal Bank, has 
about 35,000 borrowers and $2.73 billion in home loans tied to the one-year 
Treasury index, which rose from 7.72% in December to 8.35% in March. The April 
figure is due out today and "it should be a lot higher," a bank spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term fixed-rate mortgages typically are 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher 
than rates on long-term U.S. Treasury securities, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
That's because most fixed-rate home loans today are sold by lenders to 
quasi-government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie 
Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae). These agencies, in 
turn, package the loans as securities and sell them to investors, who usually 
buy them at a premium above long-term Treasury rates. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the bond market in Treasury securities, which is affected by national 
trends in employment and inflation, has become the major force behind 
fixed-rate mortgages. That explains why the rise in mortgage rates in the past 
five months "is really a bond market story," noted Mike Penzer, senior 
economist at the Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's bond market was jolted last month when consumer prices rose much 
faster than expected. The news drove down bond prices and was a major reason 
why mortgage rates jumped about a half percentage point in April. Interest 
rates rise when bond prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, bond prices rose and interest rates fell last Friday on the 
news that unemployment rates were up, possibly indicating that the economy was 
not as strong as many experts had thought. A strong economy fuels investor 
fears that inflation will get worse and cut into profits on their fixed-income 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Investors are now concerned about what role the Japanese will play in this 
week's Treasury-bond sale. Japanese investors traditionally have been big 
buyers of U.S. government securities, but recent financial turmoil in the Tokyo 
stock market have raised questions about how active they will be in this week's 
bond auction.

T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8.4 billion of news three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 7.79%, down from 7.91% last week. 
</P>
<P>
Another $8.4 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 7.84%, down from 8.03% last week. The new discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors -- 8.06% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,803.10, and 8.29% for a six-month bill selling for $9,603.60. 
The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government 
securities are purchased at less than face value.

PRODUCTIVITY DECLINES 1% IN 1ST QUARTER

The productivity of American business fell an unexpectedly sharp 1% in the 
first quarter of 1990, despite the biggest gains in the manufacturing sector in 
nearly three years, the Labor Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in non-farm productivity, a measure of efficiency and 
competitiveness of U.S. businesses, compared to a revised 0.5% advance in the 
1989 fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The slump was the largest since a 1.3% decline in the 1989 first quarter. The 
first three months of the year are often sluggish after the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Economists were expecting a modest gain in productivity, which gauges the 
output per hour of all workers. 
</P>
<P>
The figure is considered of long-term importance for the nation to reduce its 
trade deficit, because American firms must produce more at lower costs to boost 
efficiency and lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It is negative for the trade deficit because productivity weakness means we 
lose out in competitive terms internationally," said Michael Englund, economist 
at MMS International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing productivity, frequently stronger than overall results, rose a 
brisk 4.1%, exceeding its 3.1% fourth-quarter gain.

LABOR: LAWS MUST CATCH UP WITH FAMILY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress and corporations are finally showing signs that they are aware of the 
impact on family life of the dramatically changing role of women in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
After years of inaction, Congress is on the verge of adopting a compromise bill 
to set up a multibillion-dollar child-care program. Much more is needed, but it 
will be a good beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that legislation passes and is signed by President Bush, who 
supports it, Congress is expected to adopt a bill to make sure workers have the 
right to get maternity and paternity leave from their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal requires employers to provide only unpaid leave when a child is 
born, which is unfortunate because that's when a couple needs not only the time 
off but a larger income. Again, though, it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there is clear evidence that employers are focusing more than ever on 
providing fringe benefits to help the growing number of "non-traditional" 
families. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that its new survey of 100,000 companies 
indicates a trend toward an increase in family benefits, ranging from flexible 
work schedules to help for workers paying dependent-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more women have entered the work force, there has been a dramatic 
decline in traditional families, those in which the father has an outside job 
and the mother takes care of the kids and house. 
</P>
<P>
In just 15 years, the percentage of such families has been cut in half, to 23% 
of all households. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as recently as 20 years ago, about a third of all women had jobs outside 
of their homes. Today, 46% of them do, and that trend, too, is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, while Congress and employers talked a lot, little was done by 
either of them to deal with the impact of the nation's new demography. 
</P>
<P>
That continuing demographic change was part of the much-needed women's 
liberation movement. It was also spurred by the decline in real wages of men, 
which has forced many women to find paying jobs just to maintain the family's 
standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
The change created problems for many families who never faced them before: Who 
takes care of the kids when mother and father are both away at work? What to do 
about duplicative health insurance when both husband and wife have insurance 
that can help protect the other? And so on. 
</P>
<P>
Flexible work schedules can help. For the first time, the BLS survey included a 
question on flexible schedules and found that 11% of employers now offer 
workers the right to begin and end work within a range of hours to help them 
meet family commitments. 
</P>
<P>
A BLS spokesman said past spot checks show that the number of those on flexible 
schedules has gone up significantly in the past few years, and the trend is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Also useful to the modern family are flexible benefits, and they, too, are 
rising rapidly. The survey showed 9% of workers are now given a choice, for 
example, of whether to take longer vacations or increase some other benefit 
instead of taking health insurance that is already provided by a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
While that percentage is low, it's still far higher than the 2% who had 
flexible benefits just two years ago, and a Wyatt Co. survey found that half of 
the companies it checked plan to offer a choice of benefits within the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Another assist: "reimbursement accounts" from which employees can draw money, 
tax-free, to pay for such things as care for children and for elderly family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, only 5% of workers surveyed by BLS were offered reimbursement 
accounts. Now 23% can use them, and their ranks are swelling rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
While workers have to finance the accounts, the significant tax advantages make 
them worthwhile. Obviously, the plan would be much better if employers kicked 
in some contribution, too. 
</P>
<P>
The urgent need for government action to assure workers of maternity and 
paternity leave was made obvious by the latest government figures: Only 37% of 
women workers are given even unpaid maternity leave by their employers, and 
only 18% of male workers can get paternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
Don't give credit where it isn't due. Altruism wasn't a big motivating factor 
in spurring Congress or employers to action. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is finally acting because such benefits are increasingly popular 
politically, a point being hammered home in intensive lobbying by unions, 
women's groups and others. 
</P>
<P>
And companies, too, are usually acting out of self-interest. Many do it under 
union pressure, and many more know they have to offer such benefits to attract 
and hold workers, especially women, who already make up nearly half of the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
As observed by Dallas Salisbury, of the Employment Benefit Research Institute, 
it costs big money for companies to train newly hired young women, only to lose 
them when the women find later that they cannot balance the requirements of 
their jobs with family needs. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Ignagni, head of the AFL-CIO employee benefits department, says such 
benefits also increase productivity of workers, since they can do their jobs 
better if they aren't worrying about neglecting their families at home. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that increased productivity more than offsets the added costs of 
the benefits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
It is good to see that at last Congress and increasing numbers of employers are 
at least taking some steps to deal with problems stemming from the increasing 
number of women who work outside their homes.

MARKETING: AD FIRMS HEAD TO THE BEACH TO FIND A MORE CREATIVE LIFESTYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any time Chuck Kushell is so inclined, he can peer down from his office and see 
if his home is floating away. 
</P>
<P>
Kushell's home happens to be a 64-foot powerboat docked in Marina del Rey. His 
office, which has a bird's-eye view of the boat, is the West Coast branch of 
the ad agency Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos. After the firm decided to 
open office space here, primarily to create ads for Infiniti, Kushell felt 
plenty of pressure to rent office space on Wilshire Boulevard, where more than 
two dozen other Los Angeles ad agencies are located. Instead, he chose Marina 
del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a security blanket involved with a Wilshire Boulevard 
address," said Kushell. "There isn't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Just as agencies began fleeing Madison Avenue several years ago for the West 
Side of Manhattan, a similar movement away from the Mid-Wilshire District and 
Century City is taking place in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But there appears to be one key difference. In New York, it was primarily 
escalating rents that caused the mass migration. But most top Los Angeles 
agency executives whose offices have -- or are about to have -- addresses in 
Santa Monica, Venice and Marina del Rey say it wasn't better prices that lured 
them. It was the promise of better lifestyles in the beach towns. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a psychic value," said Gerrold Rubin, chairman of Rubin Postaer &amp; 
Associates, which will be moving next year from Century City to Santa Monica, 
just two blocks from the ocean. "There is a certain environment close to the 
ocean that we think attracts good people. It also breeds a creative 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Rubin Postaer, with its 160 employees, two other Los Angeles agencies 
plan to move from Century City to Santa Monica. Kresser/Craig, which creates 
ads for Arco, will be moving in September. And Poindexter/Osaki/Nissman, which 
creates ads for the Los Angeles Zoo, also expects to move there soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," said Robert Kresser, chairman of Kresser/Craig, "the 
environment's a lot more conducive to creativity in Santa Monica then it is in 
Century City." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Larry Poindexter, president of Poindexter/Osaki/Nissman, "Not only is it a 
more attractive place for employees to work, but you don't need armed guards to 
escort them to their cars at night." 
</P>
<P>
Several agencies already call Santa Monica home. Suissa &amp; Associates, which 
creates ads for the Sports Connection, has been there since opening in 1985. 
And the Shalek Agency, which places ads for Fox Broadcasting Co., opened there 
in 1988. Chiat/Day/Mojo, which moved to Venice in 1988, is in the process of 
building a $20-million-plus headquarters there which is expected to be 
completed next year. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many agency executives say that after Chiat/Day/Mojo made its move, the 
door was opened for others. "Certainly Chiat/Day broke the ice," said 
Poindexter. "They made it legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Chiat/Day/Mojo's top executives live in Marina del Rey. And a number 
of its employees live on the Westside. "Above everything else, we knew it would 
make it easier for people to get to work," said Bob Wolf, chairman of 
Chiat/Day/Mojo North America, which creates ads for Nissan. Added Wolf, "What's 
creative about being in a Mid-Wilshire high-rise?" 
</P>
<P>
For David Suissa, there was never a question about where to locate his agency 
five years ago. "Why have an agency in Los Angeles if the surroundings look 
like New York City?" posed the agency chairman, who lives in Venice, just 
minutes from his agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here to be away from everyone else," said Nancy Shalek, president of 
the Shalek Agency, which throws an agency bash on the beach every year. "We 
didn't want to be in a building where a typographer can stop once and make 12 
pickups" of ad copy from different agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is sold on being so close to the beach to feel the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles office of J. Walter Thompson moved west from Century City this 
week to a new address on Wilshire Boulevard that is closer to the beach -- if 
you consider 40 blocks close. 
</P>
<P>
While agency executives did consider property in Santa Monica, James K. Agnew, 
the agency's general manager, decided against it. "It seemed to us that it 
could be interpreted by some people as too Southern California -- or too 
flaky." 
</P>
<P>
Not about to move to Santa Monica any time soon is the Western Division of Grey 
Advertising, says Miles J. Turpin, agency chairman. Turpin says he's happy with 
his agency's Mid-Wilshire location. A move further west would put the agency 
too far away from its clients, and also too far from many key suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The pull of the ocean tide is hardly pulling Turpin. "I don't know if someone 
is more creative," he said, "because they can go down at noon and stick their 
toe in the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Many Themes of Luxury Car Ads 
</P>
<P>
What is the "hot button" for luxury car buyers? 
</P>
<P>
That's what every luxury car manufacturer -- from Germany to Japan to England 
to America -- would like to know. And a recent study of several dozen ads for 
11 different luxury car makers by the Los Angeles advertising research firm 
Phase One concludes that manufacturers from each nation are trying different ad 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
"German manufacturers believe we want practical reasons for buying a luxury 
car," said Jim Hillson, vice president and senior analyst at Phase One. 
"Japanese car makers generally portray their cars as being state-of-the-art 
machines." 
</P>
<P>
As for the British, "they're relying mainly on the tradition of British 
luxuriousness and prestige," said Hillson. And America's top-selling luxury 
cars, Cadillac and Lincoln Town Car, present "time-honored images of size and 
power." 
</P>
<P>
So, who's selling the most luxury cars in the United States? Surprise: it's 
Cadillac and Lincoln. The two car lines accounted for 56% of the luxury cars 
sold in the United States from October, 1989, through February, 1990, reports 
Ward's Automotive Reports. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as both competition and prices increase, Hillson says more luxury car 
makers will create ads to persuade consumers that luxury cars "are a 
value-driven, rather than an ego-driven, purchase." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewriting the Rules for Paying Agencies 
</P>
<P>
Tough financial times are forcing ad agencies to not only be more creative with 
their ads, but also be more creative in developing ways for clients to pay 
them. 
</P>
<P>
This week, DDB Needham Worldwide is expected to announce a new compensation 
system that will vastly change the conventional 15% system used historically -- 
but not always practically -- in the industry. Under the plan to be announced 
Wednesday, the agency is expected to tie compensation to the market performance 
of its clients' products. Some smaller agencies have already taken this tack, 
but DDB Needham would be the largest agency to formally adopt the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed the agency will seek a top dollar rate -- up to 20% commission 
-- for brands that exceed sales expectations. But it would also agree to accept 
lower rates -- from 10% to 0% -- for brands that fail to perform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Ad Duo Goes Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
Many people who create advertisements dream about getting out of the ad 
business someday to write megabuck screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
That dream became a reality last month for two Los Angeles ad men who sold 
their screenplay for a reported $750,000 to Morgan Creek Productions, which 
produced the films "Major League" and "Enemies, A Love Story." The screenplay, 
"Stay Tuned," is about a depressed television addict who makes a pact with the 
devil and is pulled into his TV set -- -- unable to escape from the frightening 
TV dimension. 
</P>
<P>
It was written during a nine-month period -- over weekends and during their 
free time -- by Jim Jennewein, former associate creative director at the Los 
Angeles agency Speer, Young &amp; Hollander, and Tom Parker, a former 
copywriter at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. They also had creative consulting 
assistance from Rich Seigel, who is a copywriter at the agency Bozell. 
</P>
<P>
Both Jennewein and Parker -- who last year produced the Adweek parody magazine 
Madweek -- have already left their agency jobs to pursue film writing careers. 
"In advertising, it's hard to be creative because of all the restrictions that 
clients place on you," said Jennewein, who is 34. "We feel emancipated."

Chrysler Corp., trying to reverse a precipitous sales slide, unveiled Monday 
the next phase of its "Advantage: Chrysler" ad campaign with advertisements 
that take on the car maker deemed by many as the company setting the industry 
standard for automobiles -- Honda. 
</P>
<P>
The ads are based on an independent survey commissioned by Chrysler that show 
its smaller cars to be preferred overwhelmingly to similarly equipped Hondas by 
a random sample of 200 owners of General Motors and Ford autos considering 
buying imports. 
</P>
<P>
The car owners were polled last month in the Los Angeles area, where sales of 
imports are traditionally strong.

<P>
The clock is running on the greatest Roman spectacle since the time of the 
Caesars. The world is watching. And here is Italy, like a tempestuous diva 
awaiting her cue, poised between triumph and disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Luca di Montezemolo is in the catbird seat. Next month he will become 
internationally famous as maestro of the 1990 World Cup. Right now, he's 
queasy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a passenger on a plane in turbulence," he said from behind his desk, 
where dreams jostle with big trouble. "I hope the pilot is in good shape, but I 
can't do anything myself." 
</P>
<P>
He has a red-green-and-white lapel button that proclaims, "Life's too short not 
to be Italian." But is time too short for the Italians to make a success of 
their prized role as host of the 1990 World Cup, a monthlong soccer 
extravaganza that many people consider the world's premier sporting event? 
</P>
<P>
With a month to go, Di Montezemolo says that organization of the matches 
themselves is on track -- but hardly anything else is. The buck is passing 
rapidly among local and national officials who understand perfectly why the 
other guy's job is not finished. 
</P>
<P>
Di Montezemolo, 42, a slick, fast-talking adman, is manager of Italia 90, a 
tournament in which teams representing 24 countries will play 52 matches in 12 
Italian cities between June 8 and July 8. 
</P>
<P>
They will be watched in 170 countries by a television audience projected by 
international soccer officials at 26 billion. That means that everybody in the 
world could see five games -- unless Italian television technicians strike. 
</P>
<P>
Will Italy embarrass itself before the world? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Di Montezemolo says. 
</P>
<P>
As the days tick away, Italy primps madly for its gala with the world, but it 
looks as though the kickoff will come before all the makeup is on. 
</P>
<P>
Labor unrest by unions hoping to cash in on a national bonanza vexes planners. 
Smooth operation of communications, transportation and hotels hangs in the 
balance. Major-league security concerns persist despite broad international 
cooperation and elaborate precautions against lager louts, those beer-swilling, 
rampage-prone soccer hearties from England and Holland who are known 
generically as "hooligans." 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the cup, the Italian government has embarked on an ambitious and 
costly national face lift. At about $4 billion and rising, public works 
spending is over budget and behind schedule in one city after another. A total 
of 24 construction workers have died in accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Construction delays contort major Italian cities that expect up to 500,000 
additional tourists for the games. Urban anarchy is not what Italy had in mind 
when it agreed four years ago to put on a festa intended to polish its 
international image, and to celebrate its status as a first-rank economic 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Roman traffic, which moves tortuously in the best of times, now moves hardly at 
all. "All this mess for nothing," scolded a Roman newspaper, counting 20 
unfinished projects, traffic-clogging eyesores every one. 
</P>
<P>
Much is promised for the Eternal City, where the final match will be played in 
an overhauled stadium that has survived 50% cost overruns and a court challenge 
from environmentalists but is still unfinished. For Rome, there are grand 
promises of more trash cans, outdoor toilets, extra buses and 2,000 new guards 
who will allow lengthened museum hours. Little has materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be ready to play in modern, comfortable and, most of all, safe 
stadia," Di Montezemolo said. "In the other areas, like infrastructure, people 
are working hard and, I am sure, well. But we are in their hands. Clearly, our 
success is related to something we can't control." 
</P>
<P>
For Italy, the World Cup is a celebration of traditional soccer passion and new 
national prosperity. Italians are now better paid than the British and are 
closing in on the French. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer ignites 57 million Italians exactly the way it captivates entire 
continents for which the game is, hands down, the ultimate athletic kick. From 
Brazilian slums to Arabian palaces, it is a poor man's zeal and a rich man's 
diversion. 
</P>
<P>
By agreement, the assembly line will stop at Fiat, Italy's giant auto maker, 
during important games. By custom, office and shop staffs on five continents 
will evaporate when national teams take the field. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, a hometown goalie when he was wearing short pants in public, 
will bless Rome's Olympic Stadium, ready or not, on May 31. One of the invited 
VIPs, President Bush, is said by Italia 90 researchers to be the only current 
world leader to have played soccer in college. Among 6,000 scrambling reporters 
at the games, Henry A. Kissinger, employed as a cup columnist by The Times, 
will add some tone. 
</P>
<P>
This year's cup play may even generate modest enthusiasm in that wasteland 
between Maine and Mexico where soccer's popularity normally hovers somewhere 
between darts and curling. An American team will compete, for the first time in 
40 years, in matches against so-so Czechoslovakia, not-bad Austria and, uh oh, 
powerhouse Italy. The baseball equivalent of an Italy-USA soccer game would be 
to schedule the Dodgers against Murmansk High. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans are young and inexperienced, prime candidates for an 0-3 
clobbering in a tournament that will be dominated, as usual, by West European 
and South American soccer giants. However chastened, the Americans will be 
back: The United States is to be host for the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one thing Americans can learn from this year's cup it is that Italy 
will be a hard act to follow, and a good act to avoid following -- except on 
the field, where the Azzurri (the Italian national team) are favorites to win 
the 11-pound, solid-gold World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Constancy, thy name is not Italy. Since being named this year's host, Italy has 
had five prime ministers. There have been four mayors amid great melodrama and 
malfeasance in Rome; as many in Naples, hardly a clockwork town, and three in 
Palermo, where street lights cost five times more to install than in Turin. 
</P>
<P>
Italy built two new stadiums for the cup, in Turin and Bari, and overhauled the 
rest. Now, unique in Europe where soccer fans are accustomed to standing, each 
of the 2.6 million spectators at the 52 games will have an individually 
numbered seat. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from FIFA, the international soccer federation and father of the 
cup, visited all 12 sites and reported serious problems in Milan, Naples and 
Rome, which has been enlarged to seat 80,000 but, in the view of some critics, 
not improved. 
</P>
<P>
"With a little bit of foresight we could have avoided this monstrosity," said 
Antonio Jannello, head of Italy's largest environmental organization. The 
stadium in Florence, home field for the United States, was criticized by FIFA 
for bad planning. 
</P>
<P>
Milan's field was resodded only last week. Whether it will be ready for the 
inaugural match between defending champion Argentina and Cameroon is now up to 
the elements. 
</P>
<P>
"As usual, all the city officials blame their failures on government red tape," 
the Rome newspaper La Repubblica noted tartly in a recent editorial. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the newspaper observed, Di Montezemolo says his responsibility stops 
at the stadium gates, the national minister of sport and tourism says he got 
his job too late to be useful and his predecessor "was too busy campaigning for 
mayor of Rome" to immerse himself in cup preparations. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, stadium costs have soared to about $800 million, nearly double the 
budget. Infrastructure projects -- a rail link between Fiumicino Airport and 
Rome and a light-rail line from downtown Rome to the Olympic stadium are 
examples -- have also mushroomed in cost. Neither is finished. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian Communist Party, which has a reputation for probity in the cities 
it governs, is demanding a parliamentary inquiry to account for the many 
millions of lire that seem to have fallen off trucks on the way to the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the welter are billions of lire being spent to guard Italy against 
the hooligans, those 20th-Century descendants of Northern European vandals who 
have sacked Italy before. 
</P>
<P>
Holland has been banished to Palermo for its matches, and England to Cagliari. 
As riotous Dutch and British fans may have occasion to observe, Sicilians and 
Sardinians are not among the sweetest-tempered Italians. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty carabinieri have spent a month in Britain learning from the British 
police how to deal with the rowdies. In all, 20,000 police officers, including 
11,000 specially trained for the cup, will patrol training camps and stadiums 
where a big-brotherly eye will monitor crowds for a police-only TV network. 
Fans who survive checkpoints 100 yards away will be frisked again at stadium 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
Sardinia has long been reckoned the No. 1 trouble spot, but lately it has 
dawned on planners that Genoa may blindside them. The Scots will play in that 
Mediterranean port, which is preparing for the 500th anniversary of the 
discovery of the New World by its native son. And it is on Columbus' Genoa that 
British, Dutch and Irish fans will converge to catch ferries for games in 
Sardinia. 
</P>
<P>
If, as expected, England advances to the second round, it could actually play 
in Genoa, thereby offering a potential battleground for the Italian army. 
</P>
<P>
The rowdies tend to be young, noxious and out of work, but the cup's charisma 
also entices the elite. His Royal Highness Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan, ruler 
of Abu Dhabi and the owner of the United Arab Emirates team, will have a 
king-size hot tub with inlaid brackets big enough for champagne bottles in his 
marbled hotel suite outside Bologna. In the hotel garden, Italian workers have 
set up a tent for use as a mosque by the sheik and his entourage of 40. 
</P>
<P>
The sheik has already had a setback. Miss UAE, Najah Hussein, finished as an 
also-ran in the World Cup beauty contest. She paraded in slacks instead of a 
bathing suit to avoid offending Islamic sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a pricey Brazilian coach, the Emirates are hardly better than the 
Americans. They won't win the World Cup either. Beyond that, in an Italy 
gridlocked and soccer-crazed for the next two months, anything at all is 
possible.

CROWN JEWEL OF MANSIONS WALLOWS IN MODERN LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 10 years now, the Greystone Mansion has sat empty, a Beverly Hills colossus 
of 55 rooms and 46,054 square feet, perched on 18 acres of hillside near 
Trousdale Estates. And no one seems to know what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
The majestic Tudor-style mansion -- considered the crown jewel in a landscape 
of fabled homes -- is owned by the city, which so far has found no public use 
for it. Time after time, grand schemes have fizzled. Some activists have hoped 
to turn Greystone into a museum, an idea that drew enthusiastic interest from 
renowned modern art collectors Joseph Hirschhorn and Frederick R. Weisman. 
</P>
<P>
Yet deals with the two collectors went the way of all other proposals -- 
nowhere. All have collapsed amid community squabbles over traffic, lease 
contracts and even matters of taste: whether, for example, modern art is 
desirable in a city better suited, some say, to the Old Masters. 
</P>
<P>
With phase one of a new, $40,000 study expected this month, efforts are under 
way to resolve the issue of Greystone Mansion and its lavish gardens once and 
for all. Skeptics abound. Such studies, committee meetings and proposals go 
back so far that most participants have lost count. No matter what the 
recommendation -- dance theater, think tank, museum of art, sorcery or 
ornithology -- Greystone has remained no more than a hulking civic enigma. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally a white elephant . . . it's a disgrace," said Frederick Nicholas, 
former president of the Greystone Foundation, a citizens committee established 
six years ago to find a use for the mansion. "They've had at least 25 proposed 
uses and nothing has come of it. It's a valuable asset being permitted to rot." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas, now chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, is a 
Beverly Hills resident who has lived next door to Greystone Mansion for 18 
years. In bitterness and frustration, he resigned from the foundation a few 
years ago, giving way to a new president, Donald DeWitt, who is less cynical 
about the mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, DeWitt is not expecting a quick solution either. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it'll settle anything," DeWitt said of the pending study by the 
planning and consulting firm of Pannell Kerr Forster. "It may give a little 
insight into some other options . . . maybe eliminate some things. We've all 
been frustrated to some degree or another." 
</P>
<P>
The latest struggle over Greystone comes amid rising concern about the fate of 
many mansions erected during the movie industry's golden age. The razing of 
Pickfair this year to make room for a new home for singer-actress Pia Zadora 
and her husband focused attention on the demise of a generation of extravagant 
mansions constructed from 1900 to 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Every year more are lost and many surviving structures are growing old and 
worn. Those in jeopardy include the Joseph Nicolosi estate in Bel-Air, designed 
by Paul Williams, and several homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, most 
notably the 1924 Ennis-Brown house, according to Jay Rounds, executive director 
of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that strives to 
protect and refurbish homes of historic and architectural significance. 
</P>
<P>
"There are others -- some not as famous -- that really have been allowed to 
fall apart, and they're in great danger of what we call 'demolition by 
neglect,' " Rounds said. "Tear-downs are pretty constant right now. It's 
certainly an area we're very concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
Greystone itself is not dilapidated, but much of the interior is tattered and 
the structure needs $3.5 million in restoration and remodeling -- including new 
fixtures and handicapped-access ramps -- to meet requirements for use as a 
public building. 
</P>
<P>
For sheer size and architectural quality, however, "Greystone really is in a 
class by itself," Rounds said. 
</P>
<P>
The new Greystone study is expected to explore multiple-use ideas: a 
limited-hours museum, for example, that could double as a corporate conference 
center or a reception site for visiting foreign dignitaries. A supporter of the 
concept, former Beverly Hills Councilwoman Charlotte Spadaro, noted that 
Beverly Hills' sister city of Cannes, France, has such a mansion, the elegant 
Villa Domergue. 
</P>
<P>
But foundation members say the mixed-use plan may draw criticism from anti- and 
pro-museum forces alike. No compromise so far has succeeded, after all, and 
competing opinions ensnarl the vast home like thick old vines. Some neighbors, 
fearful of additional traffic or trams roaring past their multimillion-dollar 
homes, hope to keep Greystone empty -- or nearly so. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the strong neighborhood lobby, picnicking and playing ball are 
forbidden on the mansion grounds, which are a public park. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see them sell it to a private individual who would live in 
it," said Alan E. Berlin, president of the 535-member Trousdale Homeowners 
Assn. "A Donald Trump or whatever. It's zoned (residential) and we believe it 
should be used as a dwelling. I frankly wouldn't care if it were subdivided." 
</P>
<P>
Museum advocates, meanwhile, want a showcase with educational programs for 
schoolchildren. They point out that Beverly Hills is without a single museum, 
concert hall, sports arena or civic auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"What cultural thing exists in all of Beverly Hills?" foundation member Ellen 
Byrens asked. "Nothing!" 
</P>
<P>
Residents talk of a memorable public hearing where one resident argued that 
Greystone should be razed, while his wife sat on the opposite side of the room, 
joining the chorus for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"I suggested they offer it to the homeless," one frustrated activist said. 
"That certainly shook everyone up." 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists point to the mansion's rich history in making their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1928 by oil baron Edward Laurence Doheny Sr., Greystone was one of the 
most magnificent estates in California, "surpassed only by Hearst Castle," 
according to historian Charles Lockwood. The mansion's 55 rooms included an 
80-seat theater, a two-lane bowling alley and a concealed, Prohibition-era bar. 
Its fortress-like walls, whose color gives the mansion its name, were set in 
place even while Doheny was embroiled in Teapot Dome, the federal oil-lease 
scandal for which he was indicted but later acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Doheny's son, Edward Laurence (Ned) Doheny Jr., received the mansion as a gift 
from his father, but lived there only a year before being found shot to death 
in a ground-floor bedroom in 1929, along with his male secretary. The 
sensational crime was never fully explained. Speculation was that the two were 
lovers. The Times reported then that the secretary had become "suddenly insane" 
and shot Doheny before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptical observers, however, questioned who shot whom, noting that the alleged 
victim -- Doheny -- was shot in the left temple, whereas the alleged assassin 
was shot through the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the owner of the Empire State Building bought Greystone, paying 
$1.5 million. But industrialist Henry Crown never moved in, and a decade later 
he was preparing to tear down the mansion and subdivide the land. In fact, 
Crown had obtained a demolition permit by the time his plan became known, 
recalled foundation member Rudy Cole. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said he rushed to City Hall just before the vote on the permit. An 
official showed him the file on the property and assured Cole that nothing 
could be done to forestall the demolition -- the paper work was in perfect 
order. As Cole tells it, the official then walked away, leaving the crucial 
file -- and Cole -- alone at the counter. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the file, put it in my briefcase, and walked out," Cole said with a 
laugh. "Tuesday, the council had its meeting. The lawyers for Crown were there. 
They were screaming, 'What do you mean, you lost the file?' " 
</P>
<P>
With the vote postponed, a save-Greystone movement was launched, Cole said, and 
ultimately Crown yielded to public pressure and agreed to a deal with the city. 
Beverly Hills bought the mansion for $1.3 million in 1965. The city installed 
an underground reservoir, which is still used, and planned to devote the 
mansion to Joseph Hirschhorn's art, which at the time was without a home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tremendous collection," recalled former Mayor Leonard Horwin, who 
served on the council until 1966. "Then . . . there was a big song and dance, 
whether Hirschhorn's collection was too modern." 
</P>
<P>
Over that and other issues involving the lease, Hirschhorn abruptly withdrew 
from negotiations and took his collection to the National Gallery in Washington 
-- a move that is still the subject of finger-pointing among Beverly Hills 
activists a quarter-century later. 
</P>
<P>
For 11 years, until 1980, Greystone was leased to the nonprofit American Film 
Institute, which was evicted for failing to maintain the structure and provide 
community educational programs. Then a long string of proposals came and went, 
the most promising of which involved Frederick Weisman's modern art collection. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman was to run his museum at Greystone on an appointment-only basis, like 
the Getty Museum in Malibu, as a concession to Trousdale homeowners. A 55-year 
lease was drawn up in 1986, with Weisman committing $8 million toward 
renovating the mansion. The deal was supported by a City Council majority, and 
success appeared inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Then, deja vu. The Beverly Hills Courier, a weekly paper, ran an editorial 
assailing modern art and touting the works of the Old Masters. ("Where in the 
hell are all these Old Masters going to come from?" fumed Greystone Foundation 
member Byrens. "Are we going to bring back Rembrandt?") At the same time, 
because of school-funding shortages, a coalition of residents began calling for 
the sale of Greystone to create an educational endowment. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman, irked over the editorial, feared the school-funding issue would cause 
him to be looked upon as an enemy of education. "That really set him off," 
recalled Robin Green, a spokesman for Weisman's art foundation. "He said, 'I 
simply cannot get involved in a situation like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Weisman backed out, and the citizens committee went back to work. In less than 
two years, a deal was hatched to create a research center for the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Natural History. The featured attraction this time was "one of 
the world's largest collections of bird's eggs," as one newspaper billed it. 
Not exactly the Louvre, but "at least it was something," Byrens said. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, however, negotiations broke down. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the stream of disappointments, the city has found good reason for 
keeping Greystone. The reservoir is there, and film companies frequently rent 
the mansion for fees that cover maintenance costs. And, of course, as a 
property investment, the estate has been nonpareil, soaring in value to upward 
of $40 million. A few years ago, one would-be buyer offered $60 million for it, 
according to Councilman Bob Tanenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has been content to hang on to Greystone. As Cole sees it, the 
important victory was to save it. Now it sits, waiting, its enormous doors 
locked, its vast main hall usually dark. The hidden bar -- reached by sliding 
up a sheet of wall paneling -- has not been used for decades. The bowling alley 
is dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's empty -- so what?" Cole asked. "It may be empty for another 40 years. But 
some day, in some future generation . . . we will develop a cultural resource 
there."

NEW SPRAYING PLAN IS UNVEILED; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: MALATHION TREATMENT WILL CONTINUE IN MUCH OF AREA NOW AFFECTED BY 
INFESTATION. NEW OUTBREAKS WILL ALSO FACE WEEKLY APPLICATIONS OF PESTICIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State agriculture officials, girding for a crucial stage in their long campaign 
in Southern California against the Mediterranean fruit fly, unveiled details 
Monday of a new battle plan that calls for continued pesticide spraying over 
much of the now-infested territory and more aggressive attacks against any new 
flare-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, roughly 250 of the 470 square miles now being treated with 
the pesticide malathion will be sprayed from one to three more times this 
month. For some sectors, spraying will be repeated each week through June. Any 
new outbreaks also will face weekly aerial applications of the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the strategy calls for less reliance on sterile fruit flies, 
which were to have replaced the controversial malathion-bearing helicopters as 
the eradicators' principal weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new scenario, most spraying will be finished by the end of May -- if 
no new flies are found. Officials, who initially had hoped to end all spraying 
by Wednesday, were reluctant to address the prospects of new outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino, and Woodcrest in Riverside County, will continue to be sprayed 
after May. 
</P>
<P>
Among communities to receive their final sprayings this month and then be 
treated with the release of sterile flies are Burbank, Hancock Park, Walnut, 
Diamond Bar, Pomona, San Dimas, Glendora, Irwindale, Azusa, Bradbury, Brea and 
La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Among communities to receive their final spraying this month and require no 
further treatment are Downey, Norwalk, Artesia, Cerritos, Gardena, Bell, 
Maywood, Lynwood, Eagle Rock, South Pasadena, Panorama City, Garden Grove, 
Pasadena, San Marino and Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the tactical shift is a widely held assumption that the next few 
months will prove pivotal in the 10-month-long struggle to eradicate the pest, 
which is regarded as a menace to the state's enormous agricultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the months of May and June will be most critical," said Isi Siddiqui, 
assistant director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Summer heat provides ideal breeding conditions for the Medfly. As part of the 
new plan, eradication efforts will begin any time a single fly is found in a 
neighborhood. Previously, two flies were required before an infestation was 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui, who heads the eradication effort, declined to assess how the campaign 
is going. "We have to find few flies for a few weeks before I can say where we 
are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Carey, one of five scientists advising the state effort, expressed 
even more pessimism about what the summer might bring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear," the UC Davis entomologist said. "We are going to find more 
(flies). It's not a matter of if, but when." 
</P>
<P>
The broad outline of the new attack had been revealed Friday when Carey and 
other science advisers made a series of recommendations to the Department of 
Food and Agriculture. Henry Voss, who heads the department, had agreed in 
principle to the new spraying schedules and protocols before their release. 
</P>
<P>
The infestation has grown over the months to about 470 square miles in Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. The state divides the 
infestation into 19 zones, stretching from Hancock Park in Los Angeles to 
Woodcrest. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's detailed, zone-by-zone schedule of spraying and sterile fly releases 
shows that about 250 square miles of the spray zone, including Garden Grove, 
Eagle Rock and Panorama City, will be sprayed up to three more times this 
month. Most will be sprayed only once more. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, malathion treatment will end Wednesday over about 225 square miles 
of Los Angeles and Orange counties, including Glendora, Brea and Upland. 
</P>
<P>
About 170 square miles of infestation will be treated with the release of 
sterile flies after the spraying ends. A shortage of the steriles, which over 
the span of three life cycles breed fertile flies out of existence, prevented 
officials from converting completely to a program of fighting outbreaks with 
one or two sprayings followed by sterile fly releases. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to more spraying in some areas, 34 square miles in the city of San 
Bernardino will be repeatedly sprayed with malathion through at least June 
because of the limited sterile fly supply. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Riverside County's Woodcrest community will be sprayed during the 
summer, largely because of its commercial citrus groves, which require a 
stricter eradication procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui cautioned that discovery of any new Medflies could force revisions in 
the plan. During the infestation in Northern California during 1980-82, a 
relatively quiet spring was followed in June and July with an explosion in the 
Medfly population. The infestation quickly grew to over 1,300 square miles -- 
still the largest Medfly infestation in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of fly trappings in Southern California this spring has Siddiqui and 
other experts nervous that they are a harbinger of a bad summer.

<P>
Malathion loses some of its potency in hot weather, forcing the state to spray 
every seven to 10 days rather than the semimonthly scheduled followed in cooler 
months., 
</P>
<P>
The news of more pesticide spraying for some communities was greeted Monday 
with derision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe anything they say anymore," Norwalk City Councilwoman Grace 
Napolitano said of state officials. "What's to prevent them from spraying 
again? It's asinine. They've got to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Even among those who will see their last sprayings this week, the reaction was 
grim. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say, 'Great, it's all over,' " said Pasadena City Director William 
Paparian. "But is it really over? When will it ever be over?" 
</P>
<P>
The panel of scientific advisers met in Los Angeles last week to review the 
state's previous plan to phase out most spraying by May 9, which the scientists 
had opposed as risky and premature. 
</P>
<P>
Voss at the time overruled the panel, believing in March that enough sterile 
flies would be available from breeding facilities in Hawaii by early May to 
replace the pesticide applications.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO LOOSEN ANTITRUST RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration on Monday unveiled its long-awaited proposal to loosen 
antitrust laws so that companies can more easily form joint manufacturing 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is part of the White House's effort to clear the way for U.S. 
companies to work together to compete against foreign firms. Several leading 
electronics firms, for example, have been trying to promote a U.S. joint 
venture to produce equipment for the emerging high-definition television market 
now dominated by Japanese and European companies. 
</P>
<P>
"With strong worldwide competition from companies abroad that often receive 
proactive help from their countries, it is important for us to at least help 
unfetter our own companies," said Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation generally follows a middle-of-the-road approach, proposing to 
make it more difficult for competitors to challenge joint ventures on antitrust 
grounds and to limit any legal awards to single rather than the current treble 
damages available to firms injured by antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials backed away from a more far-reaching plan that would 
have given blanket protection against antitrust suits to any joint venture that 
was approved by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill accomplishes a balancing of interests," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
said. "The Justice Department will continue to provide protection to U.S. 
consumers . . . while at the same time allowing for legitimate cooperative 
ventures." 
</P>
<P>
The bill enjoys widespread support among U.S. business groups. But even though 
it is watered down from what some officials wanted, the legislation could still 
run into serious challenges on Capitol Hill. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) 
has already expressed his intention to oppose any effort to loosen the nation's 
antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we think we can get through Congress," Mosbacher said. "I'd say 
our odds are better than 50-50." 
</P>
<P>
The bill comes at a time when a new study by a well-known Harvard Business 
School professor questions the basic approach behind the Administration's bill. 
</P>
<P>
Michael E. Porter, author of a forthcoming book, "The Competitive Advantage of 
Nations," argues that efforts to relax antitrust rules could well end up 
undermining U.S. international competitiveness rather than enhancing it. Porter 
argues that intense domestic competition fosters stronger U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
"While it is fashionable today to call for mergers and alliances in the name of 
globalization and the creation of national champions, these often undermine the 
creation of competitive advantage," Porter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
T. J. Rodgers, president of Cypress Semiconductor in San Jose, echoed Porter's 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got enough problems with the unfair tactics of Japanese concerns (without 
having) Washington make it worse by allowing large U.S. companies to engage in 
anti-competitive practices," Rodgers said. "I don't understand how America will 
be made more competitive by reducing the penalties for companies convicted of a 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
Most business groups, however, quickly lined up behind the Administration's 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We highly support this type of legislation," said Jim Carty, a vice president 
at the National Assn. of Manufacturers. "This is not a guarantee against 
antitrust suits, but it might help ease the unhelpful suspicion of wrongdoing 
that prevents many joint ventures from getting off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, companies can enter joint ventures for research and 
development without generally worrying about violating the antitrust laws. The 
new proposal would extend similar protection to joint production ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, Mosbacher said, "will help U.S. firms face unprecedented, worldwide 
challenges by bringing important research from the laboratory to the 
marketplace efficiently, cost-effectively and with less risk." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is also aimed at countering critics who argue the 
Administration is doing nothing to help U.S. firms compete internationally 
because of opposition among top White House officials to anything that smacks 
of government support for favored industries. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the proposed changes are relatively limited, some 
Administration officials are hopeful that the legislation will open the way to 
broader development of a promising new approach to manufacturing -- the use of 
a flexible computer-integrated plant by different firms to produce a wide range 
of goods. 
</P>
<P>
"Current law doesn't fit our need for flexibility to compete in the global 
marketplace," said an official with Hewlett-Packard Co., the Palo Alto-based 
electronics firm. "This could help in planning so you don't have unnecessary 
duplication, triplication, quadruplication of effort in the manufacturing of 
important generic products."

DEMOCRATS' BILL ON OIL SPILL CLEANUP PASSED BY ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat-sponsored legislation designed to help California respond to a major 
oil spill won easy passage in the Assembly on Monday while a competing measure 
backed by Gov. George Deukmejian stalled in a committee. 
</P>
<P>
The bill the Assembly passed and sent to the Senate would create a $64-million 
oil spill superfund and a $1-billion line of credit, backed by oil industry 
finances, that the state could use in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, drafted by Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo) and opposed 
by the industry, also would centralize the state's spill-response efforts under 
one agency in an attempt to cut through bureaucratic turf wars and hasten the 
delivery of help to a stricken area. 
</P>
<P>
It would create an emergency fund that would be available for use immediately 
after an accident and a larger source of cleanup funds for which the industry 
would be liable. 
</P>
<P>
The program would be paid for with an 18-cent-per-barrel surcharge on oil 
passing through California ports. Once the $64-million fund was established, 
which is expected to take about two years, the fee would be lowered to 3 1/2 
cents per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Lempert said even the higher charge would not be noticed by motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to see this at the pump," he said, estimating that the charge 
would translate into less than a tenth of a cent on each gallon of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Lempert and other supporters of his measure said a key provision would create a 
new state office of oil spill prevention and response to regulate oil transport 
and to respond in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The office would regulate the industry's preparation of contingency plans, 
develop prevention measures for tankers, terminals and onshore facilities and 
regulate the use of radar and other devices used to prevent oil vessels from 
colliding or going aground. 
</P>
<P>
If there were a spill, the head of the office would direct the state and 
industry response. The bill's proponents said Alaska's ability to contain last 
year's Valdez oil spill was hampered by an uncoordinated and confusing response 
from state agencies. They said California risks committing the same mistake 
because the state Department of Fish and Game, while it plays an important 
role, is not capable of directing the entire effort. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't afford to have a bunch of bureaucracies running around trying to 
figure out who is going to do what," said Democratic Assemblyman Sam Farr of 
Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans were split on the measure that passed 58 to 10. Several spoke 
against it, arguing that the proposed fee is too high and would be passed along 
to consumers. Some GOP lawmakers also said the Department of Fish and Game 
should remain the primary agency responsible for oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an unacceptable new level of bureaucracy," said Assemblyman Phillip 
Wyman (R-Tehachapi). 
</P>
<P>
But several Republicans voted for the bill, and later, in the Assembly Natural 
Resources Committee, two GOP legislators lashed out at a Fish and Game official 
who was there to argue on behalf of Gov. Deukmejian's proposal. The governor's 
plan would create a $30-million cleanup fund and leave the job in the 
department's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) said Fish and Game performed 
poorly during the recent American Trader oil spill off the Orange County coast, 
delegating far too much authority for the cleanup to the companies responsible 
for the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Beverly Hansen (R-Santa Rosa) said Fish and Game would be her 
"last choice" to run the oil spill program. "Coastal protection is far too 
important to put in the hands of an agency that hasn't proven diddly squat," 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McCallum, chief deputy director of Fish and Game, defended his 
department's performance. "Our philosophy is, don't change the system, just 
give it the resources it needs to work efficiently," McCallum said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gore, the governor's press secretary, said Deukmejian has no position on 
Lempert's bill but "favors his own plan." Gore said he does not know what the 
Administration's strategy would be if Deukmejian's proposal continues to 
flounder while Lempert's moves forward.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS SAN DIEGO COUNTY;

<P>
VOTER DISCONTENT HAS INCUMBENTS SQUIRMING

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little more than a year ago, political consultant Nick Johnson half-jokingly 
described San Diego elections as being "usually about as unpredictable as 
elections in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're an incumbent here, it's like being on the Communist Party ticket in 
Russia or East Germany," the Democratic consultant said. "You're that safe." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Johnson's comparison is perhaps even more apt than when he made it, 
though for reasons he scarcely could have imagined. For just as wildly 
unpredictable democratic reforms have swept Eastern Bloc nations, so too has 
1990 become a season of dramatic transformation in San Diego politics. 
</P>
<P>
Five San Diego-area legislators -- four state Assembly members and one 
congressman -- face serious opposition in the June 5 primary. These races have 
created the most competitive primary here in recent political history. 
</P>
<P>
And collectively, the contests have made San Diego County a compelling 
departure from the norm across the state, where primary challenges against 
incumbents typically are races more in name than in fact. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been anything like this in San Diego -- it's totally 
unprecedented," said former Democratic Rep. Lionel Van Deerlin. 
</P>
<P>
Those facing tough contests are U.S. Rep. Jim Bates and Assemblymen Pete Chacon 
and Steve Peace -- all Democrats -- and Republican Assemblywomen Sunny 
Mojonnier and Tricia Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Hunter, who is running in her first reelection campaign 
after winning a special election last October, the challenges to the incumbents 
represent the first serious primary opposition they have faced during terms in 
office stretching from seven to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Theories abound as to why primary contests that previously were little more 
than electoral formalities have suddenly become competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents' alleged ethical transgressions -- Mojonnier, Chacon and Bates were 
the subjects of official investigations recently -- galvanized several of the 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
And Hunter's advocacy of abortion rights in her conservative, heavily 
Republican district all but guaranteed that she would draw opposition, as she 
has, from an anti-abortion foe. 
</P>
<P>
Most challengers also hope to capitalize on what they perceive as growing 
public dissatisfaction with incumbents in general, a disdain they attribute to 
recent scandals in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Among the threatened incumbents, Mojonnier, Chacon and Bates -- in that order 
-- are viewed by political observers as the most vulnerable, largely because 
each has been buffeted by serious ethical charges that compounded existing 
questions about their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter and Peace, while both facing credible challengers, are expected to 
survive, barring disastrous last-minute blunders on their part. But even in 
these two races, it is a measure of the changed realities of San Diego politics 
that any uncertainty surrounds the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's opponent is Connie Youngkin, a leader of Operation Rescue, the 
anti-abortion group that stages regular protests in front of abortion clinics. 
For her part in one demonstration, Youngkin was convicted of trespassing and 
faces a six-month sentence -- creating the prospect that she could be in jail 
at some point this year. Undaunted, Youngkin has said: "First I go to jail, 
then I go to Sacramento. . . . Some of them go to Sacramento and then go to 
jail." 
</P>
<P>
Peace, meanwhile, has drawn two primary opponents -- lawyers Darrel Vandeveld 
and Robert Garcia. The incumbent's abrasive style was cited by both as a factor 
in their decision to run against him. But Peace's fund raising has outpaced his 
two foes' by a more than 2-1 ratio, and Vandeveld has been put on the defensive 
by allegations that optometrists who wanted to do business with the 
15,000-member retail clerk's union headed by his father were asked to donate 
$500 each to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign of Mojonnier's potential weakness, she has three GOP challengers -- 
former Del Mar Mayor Ronnie Delaney, La Jolla businesswoman Fay McGrath and 
Poway school board member Stan Rodkin -- in her bid for nomination for a fifth 
two-year Assembly term. Her opponents' hopes have been buoyed by a series of 
ethics-related controversies plaguing Mojonnier, an Encinitas resident. 
</P>
<P>
In February, for instance, she agreed to pay a $13,200 fine for double-billing 
the state and her campaign committee for business trips, as well as for using 
political donations to pay for fashion and beauty treatments for her staff. 
Along with other state legislators, she also was criticized this year for 
routinely using state-paid sergeants-at-arms for personal tasks, such as 
chauffeuring her children and escorting her home after evening parties. 
</P>
<P>
An issue from Mojonnier's last campaign -- her 1987 acceptance of a $10,000 
speaking fee from the California Police Officers Assn. after leaving her 
sickbed to vote for a new Los Angeles prison -- also could have a lingering 
effect. Though the state attorney general's office ruled that the award did not 
violate state law, opponents argue that it at least raised ethical questions. 
</P>
<P>
"If not dead meat, Mojonnier's close to it," said political consultant Tom 
Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
Though acknowledging that she takes her primary challenge "very, very 
seriously," Mojonnier said she is confident that she will retain her party's 
nomination -- a scenario based in part on the hope that her three opponents 
will splinter the anti-incumbent vote. 
</P>
<P>
Former Del Mar Mayor Delaney concedes the likelihood of a divided vote, but 
adds that the four-candidate race also reflects "the strong level of 
dissatisfaction with the incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
Political consultant Jim Johnston argues that Mojonnier's own woes will make it 
difficult for her to separate herself from what he predicts will be a strong 
anti-incumbent backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you conduct yourself with all due ethical and personal decorum, this 
is a tough time to be an incumbent because of the kind of news that's been 
coming out of Sacramento and Washington," Johnston said. "If you're caught up 
in one of these messes yourself, you're obviously in much deeper trouble. I 
think the dissatisfaction has built up to the point that people feel it's time 
for a change, that whomever they put in has to be better." 
</P>
<P>
Both Chacon and Bates face similar problems in their Democratic primaries. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old Chacon, first elected to the Assembly in 1970, in recent years 
has hinted that he was contemplating retirement, an inclination that some 
within his party privately suggest he should have followed. A recent California 
Journal article ranked Chacon next to last in overall effectiveness in the 
Assembly, and he has drawn increasing criticism for spending less time in San 
Diego than he does in a home he owns in Placerville, near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Another controversy surrounding Chacon involves his acceptance of $7,500 in 
honorariums from a check cashers' organization in 1988 after he abandoned 
legislation opposed by the group. More than half of the money -- $4,000 -- came 
on the same day that the bill was shelved. Though the state attorney general's 
office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge Chacon with a 
bribe -- he insists the timing of the payments was a coincidence and did not 
prompt him to drop the bill -- his critics contend that the gift places Chacon 
in the same murky ethical waters as Mojonnier. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon downplays his opposition as "part of the democratic process" and claims 
to be "invigorated" by the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest of his two foes is expected to be Celia Ballesteros, who enjoys 
high name recognition and fund-raising capability as a former San Diego city 
councilwoman. Ballesteros, in fact, out-raised Chacon, $41,559 to $27,549, from 
Jan. 1 to March 17. And she is expected to receive an additional fund-raising 
boost from abortion-rights groups that oppose Chacon's consistent anti-abortion 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The third candidate in the 79th District Democratic race -- John Warren, the 
editor of a black community newspaper -- is regarded as a long shot. But the 
votes he siphons from the two front-runners could affect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, meanwhile, was widely seen as vulnerable in the general election because 
of his rebuke by the House Ethics Committee last year for sexually harassing 
two female staff members. What came as a surprise was the serious primary 
challenge the four-term Democrat faces from Byron Georgiou, a lawyer and 
longtime party activist. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that Bates' sanction by the Ethics Committee has severely weakened him, 
Georgiou contends that the Democrats will have a better chance of retaining 
Bates' seat in November if the incumbent is not the party's nominee. Few 
Democratic leaders, however, share his analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Byron may be burning some bridges," said San Diego Democratic Party 
Chairman Irma Munoz. "Any time you challenge your own party's incumbent, there 
are consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, many feel that even if Georgiou loses his uphill campaign, he 
probably will not have irreparably harmed his long-term political goals -- a 
belief founded on the premise that, increasingly, candidates have little to 
fear from party leaders' displeasure.

insurance companies that apparently would mean very few premium rollbacks for 
California ratepayers under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
But even before consumer leaders began blasting the recommendations of Judge 
William J. Fernandez, whose removal from the matter they already had demanded, 
Gillespie tersely noted in a statement that she has up to 100 days to review 
Fernandez's opinion and render her own decision on the standards involved. 
</P>
<P>
Some department sources have indicated that Gillespie might make her decision 
in as little as 30 days. The commissioner is under pressure because her 
rollback decisions already have been delayed six months beyond the Nov. 8, 1989 
deadline she had originally set for making them. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who presided over months of Insurance Department hearings called by 
Gillespie, said in a 27-page opinion that, as far as Proposition 103 rollbacks 
are concerned, the annual rate of return standard ought to be 13.2%. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted by Gillespie, that would mean the state's insurance companies would 
not be liable to rebate to their customers any of the 20% rollback from 1987 
rate levels prescribed by Proposition 103, if they were determined to have 
received less than a 13.2% return in 1988-89 on all their applicable lines of 
insurance combined. 
</P>
<P>
For the Insurance Department's future approval of new rates, Fernandez 
recommended a variable scale for rate of return, depending on each company's 
circumstances, ranging from 11.2% to 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, last summer, Gillespie had said she would set an overall fair rate 
of return standard of 11.2%. However, since then, she has indicated that she 
might accept a higher figure. 
</P>
<P>
First reaction from insurance company lawyers to Fernandez's recommendations 
Monday was mildly favorable, although the companies had called for an annual 
rate of return ranging from 16% to 21%. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Keller, a lawyer for Travelers and other companies, said the companies had 
not received what they wanted on the rollback standards, but he said that on 
two readings of Fernandez's opinion, he believed the judge had been reasonable, 
with some ambiguities. 
</P>
<P>
But consumer leaders and Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp reacted with outrage. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said Fernandez's opinion "could just as well have been written by 
the insurance companies" and "would be a disaster for the consumers of 
California and a betrayal of the voters who enacted Proposition 103." He said 
that profit margins, under some accounting stratagems, could actually exceed 
35% under the standards Fernandez recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gnaizda, counsel for a coalition of 15 minority and low-income groups, 
said he hoped the recommendations would be ignored by Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, this pro-insurance decision is a repudiation of the laudable spirit 
of Proposition 103 and encourages insurance industry greed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gnaizda and Van de Kamp were among those who a few weeks ago demanded 
Fernandez's removal as hearing judge on grounds of a conflict of interest 
involving the judge's wife, who works for a law firm that defends insurer 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gillespie and Fernandez contended there was no conflict and Gillespie went 
along with Fernandez's decision not to remove himself. Fernandez's wife, Judith 
Fielding, said that her income and that of her husband are not commingled, and 
pointed out that he had presided over trials in which judgments were delivered 
against companies her firm had represented. 
</P>
<P>
In other parts of his recommendations Monday, Fernandez: 
</P>
<P>
Declared that insurance company political contributions, lobbying expenses and 
charitable contributions ought to be excluded and disallowed from expense 
claims the company made as part of the calculations going into gauging fair 
rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
Indicated, however, that executive salaries, no matter how high, should not be 
disallowed in the calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Contended that each company is different and no one standard would suffice by 
which the Insurance Department should approve future rates, thus justifying the 
variable 11.2% to 19% standard for the future.

CHALCO, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Ester Morales, an optimist, stared appreciatively at leaden clouds that 
had left the cluttered valley and its worshipful multitude awash in mud. The 
rain, she decided, had been nature's gift to the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two seasons here; dust and mud," she explained. "And the mud is 
dust because it just sticks to your shoes. The dust gets into everything, and 
it carries microbes, too, you know." 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, spring rain in the Chalco Valley southeast of Mexico City mostly 
mattered only to the corn. Today, about 700,000 poor people live in rough-hewn 
houses along nameless earthen lanes here on the rim of the Mexican capital. 
Local newspapers call the gigantic slum marking the edge of the world's largest 
metropolitan area "the lost city." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pope John Paul II came to Chalco to assert his church's affinity for 
Morales, her Chalco neighbors and their teeming millions of have-not kin in 
Mexico and the rest of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, like yesterday, the church, excluding partisan and conflictive options, 
wants to be the voice of those who have no voice," John Paul intoned in a 
powerful homily at a Mass for a huge, damp and awed congregation ranged before 
a tall yellow-and-white altar. 
</P>
<P>
"About 65 of us came yesterday from Toluca and slept in the bus," said Juan 
Aguilar, a 22-year-old engineering student. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you describe what it is like to see the living representative of God?" 
asked Maria Veronica Tarango, 16, a provincial haberdasher's daughter whose 
family arrived in the drizzly dawn with a five-hour wait for Mass. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul arrived in a big helicopter, crisp white skirts shielded from the 
slick black mud by expensive government works that included a paved road for 
his Popemobile. The road was lined by a sentinel chain-link fence all the way 
to the altar. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope has seen governments all over the world whitewash the unseemly for his 
visits, but he has also seen more, he told the people of Chalco on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"In many of you I see the face of Christ suffering: Faces of children who are 
the victims of poverty, abandoned, without school, without a decent home; faces 
of disoriented young people; faces of workers often badly paid and with 
difficulties in organizing themselves to defend their rights; faces of the 
underemployed and unemployed . . . faces of mothers and fathers anguished by 
the lack of means with which to sustain and educate their children. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's voice, speaking fluent Spanish, bounced over new crosses in the 
young cemetery in Chalco's next-to-last garbage dump. It reverberated through 
rusty water tanks, springless sedans, around hopeful young shrubs and 
threadbare salesmen of sweet pineapple and cheap plastic. 
</P>
<P>
"I invite all Christians and all men of goodwill in Mexico to awaken a social 
conscience of solidarity: We cannot live and sleep peacefully while thousands 
of our brothers, very close to us, lack the basics with which to live a life of 
human dignity," John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's reassertion of his church's commitment to social justice is a theme 
he first elaborated in the Third World in Mexico at a meeting with Latin 
American bishops in Puebla on his first foreign trip in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Chalco message, sandwiched between a private meeting with President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari and an afternoon service in the port of Veracruz, was the 
highlight of the second day of an eight-day return visit to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Ester Morales heard John Paul from the wrong side of the fence Monday; 
she could find no way into the ticket-only service. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the papal message may have eluded her, but the mere fact that John 
Paul would even dream of coming to Chalco reinforced a conviction that things 
are getting better here. 
</P>
<P>
The Morales family has a house with electricity and a television. There is a 
new church, and a school for her three children. 
</P>
<P>
Under Salinas, the Mexican government has spent heavily to provide basic 
services to Chalco. Water pipes are being laid, and a neighbor told Morales 
that there is a health center, although nobody at the outskirts of John Paul's 
Mass seemed sure exactly where it is. Some police patrol at night now, and 
crime is down, residents said.

Latvia promised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday that the Baltic 
republic will respect Soviet interests despite its declaration of independence 
and expressed the hope that talks would open soon. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before, Gorbachev had asked for complete information about Latvia's 
independence declaration last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov assigned several members of Parliament to 
prepare a reply. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Latvia's Parliament elected a new prime minister, Ivars Godmanis, 
a physics professor and leader of the Popular Front. 
</P>
<P>
Godmanis said in a telephone interview that he hopes Gorbachev will find the 
Latvian declaration of independence more moderate than that of Lithuania or 
Estonia and agree to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Dainis Ivans of the Popular Front, which has led the push for 
independence, called Gorbachev's request "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters, "This gives us a chance to present our point of view." The 
letter from Parliament explained certain points in the declaration, then 
concluded: "We express the certainty that the character of the declaration, the 
retention of current constitutional norms and sincere desire to respect the 
interests of the U.S.S.R. will meet with your understanding and open the way to 
a fruitful dialogue in the spirit of honest cooperation between equals." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Soviet tanks and other armored vehicles rumbled through 
rush-hour traffic in Riga, the Latvian capital. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers were officially billed as preparations for a World War II victory 
parade Wednesday, but some observers saw them as a tactic by Moscow to 
intimidate Latvians over their republic's independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Ivans, however, said he was reluctant to consider it a scare tactic, such as 
those used in Lithuania. "It might mean a demonstration of force," he said. 
"But we are trying to approach it very tolerantly." 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow on Monday, Gorbachev condemned "separatists" in a speech to a group 
of veterans. But the Tass report did not say he mentioned Latvia directly. 
</P>
<P>
"There are forces that would like to use the atmosphere of democracy, glasnost 
(openness) and freedom to implement their futile ambitious plans, including 
separatist plans," Gorbachev said.

Election officials said partial results from 52 of the 225 voting districts 
showed the Croatian Democratic Union, a right-wing and strongly separatist 
party, leading in at least 36 areas after Sunday's vote. The Communists led in 
11 districts. Final results are expected later this week.

HARDSHIP IN EAST EUROPE SAID TO FUEL ANTI-SEMITISM

<P>
The president of the World Jewish Congress said Monday that economic hardship 
in Eastern Europe is causing a rise in anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in West Berlin, where the group is holding its first 
meeting on German soil, President Edgar M. Bronfman said the countries of 
Eastern Europe are trying to introduce democratic change at a time of economic 
difficulties and that Jews once again face being singled out for attack. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to anti-Semitic tendencies in such countries as the Soviet Union and 
East Germany, Bronfman cited attempts to revive "the age-old scapegoat, the 
Jew," during economic hard times. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like it," Bronfman told the news conference at the West Berlin Jewish 
community building. "The only way to fight it is to expose it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has received personal assurances from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze that law enforcement officials will take action against those 
responsible for anti-Semitic activities. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, ultra-right members of the Russian nationalist Pamyat 
organization have threatened Jews. In East Germany, groups of young skinheads 
have expressed pro-Nazi sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
Lionel Kopelowitz, head of the European Jewish Congress, said he has also seen 
signs of anti-Semitism in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
During the Romanian election campaign, the right-wing National Peasants Party 
has denounced Prime Minister Petre Roman because he is a Jew, and some party 
members have links to the pro-Nazi Iron Guard of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The World Jewish Congress was formed in 1936 in Geneva to mobilize Jews and 
democratic forces to stop Nazi persecution. 
</P>
<P>
The group's three-day meeting is to end today with a ceremony dedicating a 
Holocaust memorial at the villa in Berlin's Wannsee district where Nazi leaders 
met in January, 1942, to plot their so-called Final Solution to kill Jews 
worldwide. The ceremony coincides with the anniversary of the Allied victory 
over Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the group Monday, a U.S. Justice Department official said 
Washington has rejected Austrian President Kurt Waldheim's repeated requests 
for a lifting of the ban that keeps him out of the country because of Nazi 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
Neal M. Sher, head of the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special 
Investigations, said that Waldheim "had engaged in Nazi-sponsored persecution." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government in April, 1987, put Waldheim, an officer in the German army 
during World War II, on a "watch list" of people denied entry into the country. 
The ban followed allegations Waldheim was involved in Nazi atrocities. Waldheim 
has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is also well known that Waldheim has tried hard and often to be a removed 
from the list," Sher said. "But all such approaches to our government have been 
rebuffed. He will remain persona non grata."

West German Nazi-hunters paid $310,000 for information that led to the capture

The record bounty was paid to an anonymous informer who led investigators to 
Argentina, where Josef Schwammberger had been living in hiding for three

WHITE HOUSE HINTS AT SHIFT ON TAXES; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: A SPOKESMAN INDICATES THAT INCREASES MIGHT BE CONSIDERED IF DEMOCRATIC 
LEADERS ACCEPT A PRESIDENTIAL INVITATION TO A FISCAL SUMMIT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House hinted strongly Monday that the Administration is willing to 
consider tax increases if congressional Democrats accept President Bush's 
invitation for a budget summit. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders cautiously considered the President's invitation Monday and 
decided to seek the views of all senators and members of the House at meetings 
today before responding. Bush has proposed top-level talks on a new spending 
and taxing blueprint for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
While the Democrats are expected to agree to the President's request, they want 
to raise questions of procedure -- such as who will be at the summit and when 
the bargaining will begin -- before giving a formal answer later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Administration apprehensions about a weakening economy and resulting reductions 
in tax revenues, along with a forecast of higher interest rates, have increased 
the importance of taking strong action to bring down the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush agreed to have "an open 
debate that is unfettered with conclusions about positions taken in the past," 
a clear allusion to the President's famous "no new taxes" campaign pledge. 
</P>
<P>
But senior White House officials tried to dampen speculation on the issue by 
saying: "Just because you're willing to talk about everything doesn't mean 
you're going to be willing to agree to everything." 
</P>
<P>
The President's main goal is to open up the budget discussion and explore 
options, these officials said. 
</P>
<P>
And Fitzwater refused to be pinned down on whether Bush has reversed his 
position on taxes to get Democratic cooperation, adding: "We'll try to keep a 
little mystery in the marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Republican congressional leaders were called to the White House today for 
discussion of the budget. Fitzwater said the President hoped to meet again with 
a bipartisan delegation by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bush's initiative, Capitol Hill observers said they expected a lengthy 
political minuet before a summit is arranged and agreements can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine downplayed news accounts 
which pictured Bush's meeting with congressional leaders Sunday night as a 
dramatic breakthrough in the months-long budget standoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize the desire to draw large and sweeping conclusions from such an 
event, but I find no basis for doing so," Mitchell told reporters. Other 
Democrats -- such as Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee -- have been skeptical about a summit, contending it would be 
used for political purposes by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"As many times as we've been burned, anyone who goes into this has to have a 
certain degree of skepticism," a Democratic staff aide said. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the mandatory deficit reduction target for the coming fiscal year 
-- now estimated at nearly $50 billion -- and the possibility that it may be 
achieved by automatic spending cuts divided between defense and non-defense 
programs if Congress and the White House fail to reach agreement on a budget. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), the ranking GOP member of the budget panel, 
warned that the specter of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts -- known 
as a sequester -- would bring pressure on the lawmakers to cut a deal with the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
"A sequester is out there and it's ominous and it's big," Domenici said at a 
news conference. "That's the ultimate fixer if we don't want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The driving force behind the White House's desire to cut a budget deal is its 
fear that pressures to boost interest rates could bring the 7 1/2-year-old 
economic expansion to an untimely end. 
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter, reducing the deficit is probably necessary to get 
interest rates satisfactorily down," White House Budget Director Richard G. 
Darman said in a speech last week. "And deficit reduction is clearly desirable 
to reduce the risk of rates moving in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
But Darman also warned that the Administration, while willing to consider some 
types of tax increases, is not interested in raising income tax rates. "The 
notion that raising taxes would solve the deficit problem . . . is much too 
simplistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What the White House is looking for may not be the same thing as the Democrats 
in Congress, who clearly hope to extract Bush's concession to raise the top 
income tax rate on the wealthy in return for any agreement to cut capital gains 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Darman, however, doesn't want to make a deal on those terms. Instead, what he 
is seeking is a capital gains tax cut aimed at stimulating "growth-oriented 
investment" and the expansion of the definition of "user fees."

Prosecutors intend to seek additional drug charges against Mayor Marion Barry, 
sources familiar with the investigation said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, prosecutors said in court papers filed Monday that hair samples taken 
from Barry the night of his drug arrest show he had "used cocaine repeatedly" 
in the preceding weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. Attorney Jay B. 
Stephens wants a federal grand jury to return up to five more misdemeanor drug 
possession charges against Barry. 
</P>
<P>
Barry already faces five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges and three 
felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his drug use. He has 
pleaded innocent to all eight counts.

Selma's first black schools superintendent resigned Monday and said he would 
drop his $10-million racial discrimination suit against the city and the school 
board in return for a cash settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Norward Roussell cited the stress of the turmoil surrounding his case since the 
school board voted late last year to dismiss him. 
</P>
<P>
He said the settlement was "close to" what he would have received if his 
three-year, $69,500-a-year contract had been renewed, about $208,500. 
</P>
<P>
The vote by the white-controlled board not to renew Roussell's contract sparked 
protests by blacks, some of whom were arrested during demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The board said it voted to dismiss Roussell him because of his management 
style.

300 FLEE FLOODING IN ARKANSAS AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Floodwaters surged down the Arkansas River on Monday, forcing more than 300 
people to flee their homes and causing millions of dollars in damage to roads, 
bridges and buildings in what may be the worst flooding in Arkansas in 63 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Some 327 homes have been evacuated in six Arkansas counties along the Arkansas 
River. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency workers said 182 homes were evacuated in Jefferson County and 
predicted an additional 200 evacuations before the flooding ends. The river is 
expected to crest today in Little Rock and Wednesday in Pine Bluff, Jefferson 
County, about 40 miles downstream. 
</P>
<P>
A Pulaski County judge on Monday called in the National Guard and declared a 
state of emergency in the county to prevent further looting in some evacuated 
neighborhoods northwest of Little Rock.

An explosion ripped open a Bank of America night deposit box Monday, littering 
the bank parking lot with an unknown amount of money and causing $100,000 
damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"The night deposit door was blown about 500 feet away and there was money 
scattered. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pretty powerful explosion," said Fred Reagan, spokesman for the Los 
Angeles FBI office. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had not determined whether the explosion was part of a robbery 
attempt. No arrests had been made. 
</P>
<P>
A minor fire followed the 4:47 a.m. explosion at the Bank of America branch on 
East Palm Canyon Drive near Sunrise Boulevard in the Smoke Tree Shopping 
Center, said Police Sgt. Gary Jeandron. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
FBI bomb experts and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department bomb squad 
examined the destruction Monday afternoon in an effort to determine the type of 
explosives used and a possible motive, Police Lt. Lee Weigel said. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America officials said a bomb was placed in the night deposit box. The 
explosion damaged the box and a portion of the bank wall, said Tom Chapman, a 
bank spokesman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no loss of customer information and the safe deposit boxes weren't 
damaged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank remained closed Monday, but customers will have access to safe deposit 
boxes today, Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank will reopen for all transactions within 10 days, he said. Meanwhile, a 
mobile branch was to open today in the parking lot next to the bank.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE TV CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ballot measures: Propositions 108 and 111. The proposals would modify the 
state's spending limit, trigger a 9-cents-per-gallon increase in the gasoline 
tax phased in over five years and authorize a $1-billion bond issue for mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
Whose ad?: Yes on Propositions 111 and 108, a campaign headed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian and supported by business, labor and professional groups. 
</P>
<P>
Two 30-second spots featuring traffic congestion and the Bay Area earthquake 
are scheduled to run for the next two weeks. They began appearing Monday night 
in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco-San Jose and Sacramento television 
markets. Although there is no well-financed opposition to the two ballot 
measures, the television campaign is considered critical to overcoming a 
general voter distrust and dislike of tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Neither advertisement mentions that the passage of Proposition 111 would 
trigger a gasoline tax increase. Neither do the TV ads mention that Proposition 
111 would raise the state spending limit to allow expenditure of revenue from 
the increased gasoline taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the ads, with an analysis by Times staff writer Virginia Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad: "Experts warn us traffic will double in the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Actually, the ad is referring to studies showing that in specific 
areas within urban regions, particularly San Diego and Los Angeles, traffic is 
expected to double and triple over the next decade. A report by The Road 
Information Program (TRIP) released in January found that on a statewide basis 
traffic congestion is expected to increase 33% over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Propositions 111 and 108 raise money for specific projects. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Legislation accompanying the two measures does require the completion 
of highway projects already scheduled but unable to be completed because of 
lack of funds. However, it still gives the California Transportation Commission 
latitude to approve additional highway and mass transit projects within certain 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: " . . . Like fixing potholes . . . improving freeways . . . and providing 
other ways of getting around." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Recents polls show that voters prefer seeing their transportation 
dollars spent for highway maintenance and repair rather than new construction. 
And a recent Los Angeles Times poll indicated voters were more inclined to 
support tax increases for public transit than highways. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "We have the technology to protect these structures from earthquakes like 
the one that hit San Francisco in October. We just don't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Actually, the California Department of Transportation has the 
technology to retrofit single-column bridges for earthquake safety, but 
officials are still working on the technology to retrofit some multi-column 
bridges.

CAMPAIGN FOR GAS TAX GETS INTO HIGH GEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
For the next two weeks, residents of California's major cities will flip on 
their television sets for the evening news only to be greeted with a graphic 
reminder of one of their daily frustrations -- traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The image flickering on the television screen will be reminiscent of the scene 
and sounds most will have left not long before. Cars bumper to bumper on the 
freeway. Horns honking. Gears grinding as giant trailer-trucks slow to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just as the viewer begins to tense up again, a voice will suggest softly, 
"Experts warn us traffic will double in the next 10 years. We need to do 
something now to handle that traffic." 
</P>
<P>
That something, it turns out, is the passage of Propositions 111 and 108, the 
ballot measures that would raise $18.5 billion over the next decade largely by 
increasing the gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon and authorizing a $1-billion 
bond issue for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
The new television spot is part of a two-week advertising campaign to win votes 
for the two propositions, which were designed by Gov. George Deukmejian and 
legislative leaders of both parties to improve California's transportation 
system, ease congestion and expand mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
"The polls show the more the public knows about these issues, the better are 
our chances," said Don Schrack, a spokesman for Woodward-McDowell, a 
Burlingame-based consulting firm that is spearheading the campaign to pass the 
two measures. "Those who seem to have a pretty good grasp of (Proposition 111) 
are favoring it 2 to 1." 
</P>
<P>
A second television spot to be aired at the same time attempts to rekindle the 
memories and fears that accompanied last October's Bay Area earthquake. The 
camera moves to scenes of damaged bridges and freeways as an announcer solemnly 
proclaims, "Earthquakes are a fact of life in California and we've all seen 
what they can do." 
</P>
<P>
The scene shifts to shots of other freeways and bridges undergoing repairs. 
This time the voice is more insistent: "When it happens again -- and it will -- 
we need to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
The two 30-second spots have two messages. The first suggests that traffic 
congestion will only get worse unless voters provide the money through the 
passage of Propositions 111 and 108. The second is more ominous, implying that 
the state will not have enough money to make its bridges and freeways 
earthquake-safe unless the two propositions are approved. 
</P>
<P>
Schrack said the campaign hopes the emphasis on the earthquake will draw more 
support for the gasoline tax increase. He said that immediately following the 
quake, polls showed strong voter interest in the gas tax increase but that, as 
memories of the event faded, so did support for the tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
Television advertising for the campaign has been limited by a shortage of 
funds. Deukmejian, who is heading the campaign, had hoped to raise $5 million 
for it but so far has fallen far short of that goal.

The coach of Italy's national soccer team has asked his players not to engage 
in sex until the World Cup tournament ends July 8. 
</P>
<P>
Azeglio Vicini said Monday that this weekend will be the last at liberty for 
the players before a long period of "seclusion." 
</P>
<P>
"Chastity of players prior and during a major competition has been a 
long-debated but unsolved problem," Vicini said. 
</P>
<P>
For entertainment, he said, the players will have videotapes and a few 
excursions out of the training center -- under the watchful eye of Vicini and 
other team officials.

More than 15 people have been robbed during the past 10 days by so-called 
"oilcan bandits," who greased a hilly street in an inner-city neighborhood and 
then pounced on stalled motorists, authorities said. Police put a temporary 
stop to the street crimes by stationing marked patrol cars at the oiled-down 
intersection in the city's Army Street thoroughfare near U.S. 101. In each 
case, police said, motorists unable to drive up the oil-slicked street were 
attacked by five or more men wielding clubs and occasionally guns.

FATTI WALI, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From horizon to horizon, the wall slices through wheat fields, rivers, deserts 
and mountain passes. It severs two nations, separates hundreds of millions of 
people and towers over this troubled region like a barbed-wire metaphor for 
mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
The wall spans about 400 miles of the Indo-Pakistani border, punctuated by 
3,050 sandbagged machine-gun nests, 2,500 observation towers, thousands of 
yards of electrified concertina wire and 6,750 thousand-watt, halogen-quartz 
searchlights that bathe the nighttime landscape in institutional orange. 
</P>
<P>
To the Indians, who spent two years and millions of dollars building this mass 
of wire and steel, it is a "border security fence." 
</P>
<P>
To the Pakistanis, though, it has come to be known as "the New Berlin Wall." 
</P>
<P>
And to an outside world increasingly concerned about the escalation of 
political tension, war rhetoric and bloodshed throughout South Asia, the wall 
is the most dramatic symbol of the hatred in this part of the world, where 
violence and killing have become inescapable companions of life. 
</P>
<P>
There is a kind of global counterpoint at work here: At a time when peace is 
breaking out in Europe and Central America, the region encompassing India, 
Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan has become a virtual war zone. Of 
the area's six principal nations, only Bangladesh has been relatively quiet 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when Moscow and Washington are discussing nuclear disarmament, 
politicians in India and Pakistan -- now poised on the brink of what would be 
the two nations' fourth major war -- are urging their leaders to stockpile 
nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
And at a time when walls and fences are being replaced by elections and 
dialogue in much of the world, South Asian nations increasingly are sealing 
themselves off from their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a siege mentality that you are witnessing in this region," said one of 
India's leading intellectuals, Rajni Kothari, who serves on his government's 
planning commission. "You have a number of regimes that feel as if things are 
caving in on them, and so the mentality is, 'Seal it all up, and it'll go 
away.' " 
</P>
<P>
But it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Not a week passes in this region without some kind of violence -- terrorist 
bombings, police killings, dangerous street protests, assassinations, 
kidnapings, religious clashes, ethnic unrest, attacks on government targets. In 
the last three weeks alone, armies were called out to keep order in three South 
Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
What are the roots of the conflicts that have transformed South Asia into a 
danger zone? And where may these conflicts lead? 
</P>
<P>
Analysts, generals, political leaders and businessmen almost universally reject 
the most commonly held outsiders' view -- the stereotype that the violence is 
spawned by the region's serious overcrowding and persistent poverty, which have 
combined to cheapen the value of life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very dangerous view, it's fascist and it's absolutely untrue," said 
Kothari. "It has condemned an entire culture for an easy way of explanation. 
'They're underdeveloped, so naturally they kill each other' is the way you 
usually hear it. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, even the ruling elite in these countries uses this same explanation 
in the very same language." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Kothari and most other sociopolitical experts blame the violence and 
war on that same ruling elite -- a feudal structure that has kept traditional 
leaders and landed classes in power throughout each nation's modern history. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this violence is related to an ongoing rejection of the extremely 
irresponsible, autocratic and venal state elites who have been unable to 
address themselves to the real needs and problems of the people," said Bharat 
Wariavwalla, an independent political and defense specialist in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
"The seeds of it were planted during the region's colonial experience, when the 
British empire brought to the subcontinent a paradoxical combination of strong 
state rule and liberal democracy. What we're seeing now is a struggle between 
those concepts, as the forces of liberal democracy are resorting to violence in 
an effort to throw out these strong but corrupt state elites." 
</P>
<P>
Although the analysts conceded that, on the surface, the conflicts appear to be 
based on sharp religious or ethnic differences, they insisted that most are 
more deeply grounded in an almost universal desire for increased 
self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in India, the largest and most consistently violent of the 
region's flash points, the three major internal insurgencies in the states of 
Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Assam are all driven by local ethnic majorities 
battling for autonomy from authorities in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
An echo of India's separatist violence can be found in Pakistan's two southern 
provinces of Sind and Baluchistan. More ethnic strife has exploded in Sri 
Lanka's northern Jaffna region, which has been facing a two-front insurgency 
from ethnic Tamils in the north and impoverished Sinhalese in the south. 
Leaders of both militant groups argue that they have been shortchanged by the 
ruling elite in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the unrest in Nepal and Afghanistan, two fiercely independent 
nations that do not share the subcontinent's colonial roots, was born of 
corrupt, autocratic monarchies that flourished for centuries before falling to 
populist uprisings. 
</P>
<P>
In Afghanistan, King Zahir Shah was overthrown, and a later Soviet-backed 
takeover spawned the past decade of war by Muslim rebels. The guerrillas, known 
as moujahedeen, reject both the monarchy and the Communist state and demand to 
be left alone in tribal-based autonomous regions of a decentralized nation. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal, where many believe the monarch to be a reincarnation of the Hindu god 
Vishnu, was the stage for the most dramatic of this year's violent struggles 
for change in South Asia. After eight weeks of brutal government crackdowns on 
pro-democracy demonstrations in Katmandu, the capital, Nepalese rose up against 
the autocratic rule of King Birendra. He is now being forced to gradually shed 
his power as anti-government violence continues. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding the global context for their celebrated rebellion, leaders of Nepal's 
"people power revolution" acknowledged during their two-month protest that it 
was inspired and aided by last year's democratic breakthroughs in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A thousand miles to the south, prominent Sri Lankan analyst Neelan Tiruchelvam 
echoed that theme, quoting from Czechoslovak leader Vaclav Havel to explain how 
war had left all of Sri Lankan society "morally flawed" and in need of a 
radical overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
And intellectuals in Afghanistan, far to the west, also referred to Eastern 
Europe to explain why Najibullah, the strongman president, has been forced to 
cede so much power in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"In the cases of both Eastern Europe and South Asia, we are seeing the same 
populist demands for change, but the big difference is they are manifesting 
themselves in very different ways because the roots of our ruling elites are 
different," Indian analyst Wariavwalla said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Eastern Europe, the repressive regimes were planted there by the Soviets. 
Once they were removed, they were bankrupt -- politically, morally and 
popularly -- and could offer no real resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"In South Asia, these regimes were not planted by anyone but ourselves. They 
have come as a result of our own democratic failures. They are home-grown 
dictatorships and autocracies that have developed their own constituencies. So 
the struggle to unseat them becomes that much more prolonged and violent." 
</P>
<P>
There is another indigenous component to South Asian political violence. 
Kothari of the Indian government calls it "the noise factor." 
</P>
<P>
"When this popular desire for change slams up against an all-powerful ruling 
class, the only thing that works in these elitist societies is noise," he said. 
"Letters to the editor don't work. Appeals to elected representatives don't 
work. They're all part of the system. Noise works. Bomb blasts work. Killings 
work." 
</P>
<P>
The region's nations also have been employing the noise factor more broadly and 
ominously, triggering an unprecedented arms race on the subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
India was the world's largest international buyer of weaponry during the last 
five years -- more than $17 billion worth of warplanes, heavy artillery and 
gunships for what already is the world's fourth-largest army. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has responded by continuing its largely American- and Chinese-supplied 
buildup of sophisticated weapons, a policy that is absorbing half the national 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
For self-acknowledged "peaceniks" such as Kothari, the subcontinent's arms race 
is being exacerbated by what he called "the armament culture of the First 
World. . . . It's supply-side violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing for Mikhail Gorbachev to talk about peace in the world. It's 
another to get his 'arms-niks' to stop sending us warplanes. It's one thing for 
George Bush to say cool down tensions in South Asia, but it's quite another for 
him to say no more arms for Pakistan." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kothari readily concedes that it is the homespun cult of violence 
spawned by years of state repression in South Asia that fundamentally is to 
blame for the spiraling bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
"And I see Kashmir as a kind of symbol of how we are keeping that psychology of 
confrontation alive," he added, referring to the north Indian state of Jammu 
and Kashmir, a traditional flash point that many analysts fear could drive 
India and Pakistan to war this year. 
</P>
<P>
India's severe crackdown on Kashmir's Muslim separatist movement has angered 
Pakistan, which was created as an Islamic state during the 1947 partition of 
the subcontinent. And India has refused to rule out an attack on Pakistan, 
which it accuses of fueling the insurgency by training and arming militants 
across the border. 
</P>
<P>
Although most military commanders on both sides oppose war, and most analysts 
call it "an irrational option," Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh 
and Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto -- both of them from ruling-class 
families and both presiding over weak, minority governments -- have ruled out 
any negotiation on the Kashmir issue. 
</P>
<P>
Experienced observers such as Kothari are now left fearing the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"My own view is things will get worse before they get better on every front in 
South Asia, until people are shocked out of their complacency," he said. "And 
this is mostly because the middle- and ruling-class elites are simply not aware 
of the fences that are going up throughout our society as a result of their 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, they're only aware of the ones they have built with their barbed 
wire and steel." 
</P>
<P>
Blood and Ethnic Pride 
</P>
<P>
1. AFGHANISTAN 
</P>
<P>
Since Soviet invasion in late 1979, U.S.-backed Muslim guerrillas have fought 
Marxist regime in Kabul. Deaths estimated at more than 1 million and refugees 
at 5 million. Rebel rocket attacks on major cities continue. Soviet troops now 
out, but rebels' "holy war" has all but collapsed in infighting. 
</P>
<P>
2. NEPAL 
</P>
<P>
Scores of civilians have been shot by security forces this year as remote 
Himalayan kingdom struggles to move to democracy. After violence last month, 
King Birendra agreed to elections, but violence between populist and 
establishment forces continues. 
</P>
<P>
3. SRI LANKA 
</P>
<P>
Once-idyllic island has seen up to 8,000 lives lost in past year amid two-front 
insurgency. President Ranasinghe Premadasa has largely put down rebellion by 
leftist People's Liberation Army in south and central regions. In north, where 
minority Tamil community has waged secessionist war, Premadasa has struck up 
political dialogue with Tamil Tiger rebels and negotiated pullout of 50,000 
Indian peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
4. PAKISTAN 
</P>
<P>
Two provinces torn by secessionist movements, worst in Sind, where Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto called out army in Karachi to combat violence between 
Sindi majority and Urdu-speaking Mohajirs. In Baluchistan, another anti-federal 
movement grows, fueled by arms and heroin traffic resulting from Afghan war. 
</P>
<P>
5. INDIA 
</P>
<P>
Armed secessionist movements in three border states lead to almost-daily 
terror; bombs have killed hundreds this year. In Jammu and Kashmir, Muslim 
guerrillas have sought autonomy for 40 years. In Punjab, separatist Sikhs have 
fought for eight years. And in Assam, armed wing of state's Bodo majority 
demands independence. 
</P>
<P>
6. INDIA and PAKISTAN 
</P>
<P>
Hot rhetoric focuses on Kashmir, site of two previous wars, now split along 
"line of last control." Region is India's only Muslim-majority state; New 
Delhi's crackdown on Kashmiri insurgents has angered Muslim Pakistan. India has 
bigger army, but both have medium-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting 
each other's cities.

<P>
The Red Army on Wednesday will parade through Moscow's Red Square to mark the 
45th anniversary of the Allies' victory in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may be staging the 
display as a gesture to the military, which has been restive over relentless 
budget cuts and the realization that in the Soviet Union of the future, the 
armed forces may have a diminished role. 
</P>
<P>
The parade also comes against the backdrop of moves toward German 
reunification. On the anniversary of victory, some Soviet militarists fear that 
the postwar settlement -- guaranteeing a divided Germany that would never again 
threaten its eastern neighbor -- is coming undone.

<P>
Lei Feng is a most unlikely hero. 
</P>
<P>
A military man who died in a ridiculous accident, Lei Feng was a naive 
do-gooder whose highest goal was to be a "rustless screw" in the great machine 
of communism. 
</P>
<P>
His short life, according to official histories, came to an abrupt end in 1962, 
when one of his comrades backed a truck into a utility pole. Lei, 22, failed to 
dodge, and the falling pole killed him. 
</P>
<P>
An ignominious end? Not at all. The next year, Chairman Mao Tse-tung himself 
called on the entire nation to "learn from Lei Feng." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting movement faded in the mid-1980s, as attention turned to material 
incentives and economic development. But now China is in the midst of a Lei 
Feng revival, thanks largely to last June's massacre of pro-democracy 
protesters in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? 
</P>
<P>
Many things, at many levels. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Lei has lots of company in a long and mostly honorable tradition 
of model figures. 
</P>
<P>
There's the Foolish Old Man who moved the mountain, the hero of an old fable 
about perseverance. Mao revised the old man's story into a political tract on 
fighting imperialism. Then there are historical figures like the Song Dynasty 
general, Yue Fei, a model of patriotism for generations of schoolchildren. And 
there are new heroes like Lai Ning, a 14-year-old boy who died fighting a 
forest fire. 
</P>
<P>
The use of moral suasion to educate and control the masses is quintessentially 
Chinese, with roots more than 2,000 years old. In the Communist era, Mao and 
his comrades could make good use of figures like Lei, an army truck driver who 
did voluntary work on construction projects and happily gave money to peasants. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese society from the beginning has this sense of people learning from good 
examples, rather than from sanctions imposed on them," commented Jerome A. 
Cohen, a former Harvard law professor living in Hong Kong. "It goes back to the 
whole Confucian ideal that rules and regulations are a last resort, that the 
good ruler sets the standard to which all should repair. The Communists built 
upon this." 
</P>
<P>
Is it really surprising that the old men who crushed last spring's protests 
reach out nostalgically to a safely dead, good-hearted soldier who washed his 
comrades' socks without even being asked, and who, more important, never ever 
questioned authority? Who better to help refurbish the army's sullied image and 
promote social stability? 
</P>
<P>
So what if sophisticated and cynical urbanites mock the new Lei Feng campaign? 
So what if despised "bourgeois liberals," tainted by Western ideas of 
individual rights, joke that the main thing to be learned from Lei Feng is to 
watch out for falling telephone poles? 
</P>
<P>
Yang Baibing, 70, responsible for political controls within the army, declared 
in a speech launching the new campaign that Lei "will forever be a brilliant 
example from which to learn." 
</P>
<P>
He then outlined the intended lessons: 
</P>
<P>
* Love for the Communist Party and hatred of class enemies. 
</P>
<P>
* Obedience to the party. 
</P>
<P>
* Selfless service to the people. 
</P>
<P>
* Thrifty living. 
</P>
<P>
* Hard work in any assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Yang also left no doubt that the campaign will press the claim that martial-law 
troops acted honorably in their June assault in Beijing, which left hundreds 
and perhaps thousands of civilians dead. 
</P>
<P>
"In the struggle to stop turmoil and quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion . 
. . the units that implemented the tasks of enforcing martial law performed in 
an outstanding manner," Yang declared. "Their deeds can be described as a 
reappearance of the spirit of Lei Feng." 
</P>
<P>
Old Lei Feng movies are now airing on television, while a new TV series is 
being created. Newspaper articles sing his praises and publicize new examples 
such as Zhang Zixiang, a "model soldier of the Lei Feng type" who gained fame 
earlier this year for repairing thousands of his comrades' home appliances 
free. Work units and schools organize public service activities in the name of 
studying Lei Feng. 
</P>
<P>
Some people respond to all this with pure cynicism, others with seemingly 
unquestioning acceptance. Many have mixed feelings, believing that Lei was 
indeed a good person but that his legacy is being abused. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should try to be like Lei Feng," commented a middle-aged 
scientist. "But I don't like it when this is used for other purposes . . . like 
promoting the image of the army." 
</P>
<P>
Lei's greatest influence is in schools, where his name and that of Lai, the 
teen-age forest-fire-fighting martyr, are often linked. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the campaign of learning from Lai Ning and Lei Feng, the students have 
begun to consider the question of what is their world outlook," said Zhang 
Peilan, a math teacher at a Beijing middle school. "Before learning from Lai 
Ning, some of our students would compete about who could spend more money, who 
ate well, who had the more fashionable clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Qi Xiaobin, a high school junior, explained how students should learn to place 
collective interests first. 
</P>
<P>
"Lei Feng never had a sense of individualism," she said. "He acted for the 
public welfare. . . . When people consider their individual interests and 
collective interests, they must consider which is more important. . . . For 
example, when a test is coming soon but we also have a big classroom cleaning 
activity, should we participate in this program or go home and study? In this 
kind of situation, we have to make a distinction between individualism and 
collectivism. . . . We should participate and not say that because we have to 
study we can't come." 
</P>
<P>
Even many adults who are cynical about this latest Lei Feng movement believe 
that education based on model individuals can be good for children. 
</P>
<P>
But among the partially Westernized, urban intellectual elite of today's China, 
many believe that the Lei Feng campaign has it all wrong -- that what China 
actually needs is to abandon the whole Confucian legacy of meek obedience to 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Lei Feng was just a stupid young soldier," said a graduate student. 
"He didn't really understand anything about our government. He was just 
obedient. This is the kind of people our government wants. They want to hold 
back society, because they know that if it develops, the government will crash 
down."

<P>
It was a dark night in a pine forest, the Baltic Sea a faint murmur on a gravel 
beach a quarter-mile away. Three men -- amber hunters -- were out checking on 
their digs in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Leszek, Krzysiek and Andrzej, young advocates of unbridled private enterprise, 
were moving with a certain stealth. It was vault-dark, and they carried no 
flashlights, but the way was familiar. 
</P>
<P>
They were on the lookout for police. The problem is, they said, that the 
authorities issue only a few licenses for amber digging, contending that it 
causes environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
Andrzej and his colleagues had a six-man crew working in the forest. They were 
looking for a "fritz," their word for a cabbage-sized chunk of amber. Andrzej, 
who wore a blue jogging suit that appeared to glow faintly in the gloom, 
stepped carefully around the depressions in the forest floor where his crews 
had been working earlier in the week. It was nearly midnight. The lights of a 
car approached on a nearby lane. The three men froze, watched until the car was 
gone, then walked on, talking quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, yes, it's true nothing much grows for five or six years after amber 
diggers have been around," Leszek admitted. But he preferred to take a long 
view of the damage. "It will come back, eventually. In the meantime, now that 
we're reforming the system, the government ought to just declare this a mining 
area and get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
Leszek, Krzysiek and Andrzej have three perfectly legal amber digs in the 
pastures of local farmers and employ about 30 diggers to search for the amber. 
The work in the forest amounts to supplementary income, but they are convinced 
that this is where the best stuff comes from. In fact, it is probably where 
most Polish amber comes from. 
</P>
<P>
Once it came only from the beach. A few times a year, most commonly in the 
fall, storms blowing out of the northwest churn up the floor of the Baltic Sea. 
For longer than anyone can remember, inhabitants of the Baltic coast have 
hurried to the shore on mornings after the big storms to pick up amber left 
behind by the waves. 
</P>
<P>
"You go out early in the morning," Krzysiek said, smiling at the vision, "and 
you can see it, a line of it, floating off shore. It's like a tide of money. 
When it comes in, people run around like crazy, picking it up and stuffing it 
into bags." 
</P>
<P>
Leszek and company, however, are not the type of fellows who are content to 
hang around depending on the weather for a chance to go to work. Like scores of 
other amber diggers who do their mining at midnight, they apply considerable 
creative energy to outfoxing the police and developing ever more efficient 
systems to haul up the amber buried in the forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
"You wait for storms," said Leszek. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch out!" whispered Krzysiek. "Who's that?" 
</P>
<P>
They stopped and peered at a figure lumbering through the trees. It was a large 
man, carrying coils of fire hose over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Karol." 
</P>
<P>
"This way," said Karol, and led on through the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Amber is an old obsession, the stuff of mystery, myth and commerce, apparently 
since prehistoric times. It has turned up at Stonehenge and in ancient Greek 
tombs. Romans wore amber amulets as protection against witchcraft; a slave 
could be purchased for the price of an amber figurine. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Leszek, Krzysiek and Andrzej are concerned, this goes back to before 
communism was invented, and then died, and therefore ought to predate any 
strong governmental claim. They recognize this argument as a shaky legal 
position, so their methods of operation are designed to attract as little 
attention as possible. Apparently, thousands of years of amber gathering has 
still left what Leszek confidently calls "an endless supply," and he and his 
colleagues are dedicated to its extraction. 
</P>
<P>
Amber is a curious material, the fossilized sap, possibly of pine trees, broken 
by frost and swept into the sea some 60 million to 70 million years ago. It is, 
in effect, nature's own plastic, a material so light that it will float in a 
strong solution of salt water, buoyant enough in seawater to have been carried 
along on bottom currents for millions of years. It is soft enough to be 
scratched by a copper penny, breakable but not bendable. When rubbed, it gives 
off a pleasant, resinous aroma. It dissolves slowly in alcohol, and old 
remedies call for carrying a bit of amber in a vial of alcohol and sipping the 
resulting brew as a tonic for rheumatism. 
</P>
<P>
It ranges in color from a milky white to a ruby red, but it is most commonly 
the variable brownish-yellow hue associated with its name. The prettiest 
pieces, with interior cracks and "clouds," seem to glow from within. Some show 
trapped insects or plants, apparently thousands of years old. By jewelers' 
standards, amber in raw form is cheap. Sold wholesale by weight, prices range 
from $45 to $300 per kilogram (2.2 pounds), depending on the quality, although 
single large and unusual pieces and those with visible "inclusions" of plants 
or insects sell individually for more. Most amber hunters have rare pieces, 
favorites they will not sell. Leszek, for example, has a set of amber 
"icicles," a collection he has accumulated over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
No one around Gdansk seemes to know just how much amber comes from the southern 
Baltic every year. 
</P>
<P>
"A tremendous amount is smuggled down here from the Soviet Union," said Romuald 
Moch, president of Gdansk's Cooperative of Polish Artists, whose craftsmen work 
the amber into jewelry. "Russia still is the world's largest producer. But the 
Russians, they have no soul for amber. The best is from here." 
</P>
<P>
Leszek claims that it was his own father (widely known among amber hunters here 
as "One-Armed Max") who hit on the currently employed method of mining amber, 
back in the late 1960s. He had taken his horse and wagon down to the 
construction site for the North Port of Gdansk, and, as he sat watching aboard 
his wagon, he noticed amber swirling up from the watery sands when cranes 
removed old pilings from a pier. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Son, I've got an idea,' " Leszek recalled. "He bought an old pump 
and some hose, loaded it on the wagon and drove to the forest. He pumped water 
out of a pond and pushed the hose straight down into the sand. That's how we 
started." 
</P>
<P>
Refining his technique, One-Armed Max learned to attach the hose to a pole and 
thrust the nozzle deep into the ground, the force of the water boring a hole in 
the sand and heaving up sand and bits of wood. 
</P>
<P>
And amber, lots of amber, which floated straight out of the hole, bright yellow 
in a mass of wood scrap. Sometimes Max would hit a whole layer of amber, and it 
would rattle in the water as it rose to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Max and Leszek worked in state-owned forest lands, mostly. Essentially these 
were parks, and the amber diggers left behind pond-sized circles of white sand 
that blanketed the topsoil and wiped out all vegetation except large trees. 
People complained. Police came. Pumps and wagons were confiscated and sold at 
auction, quite often to their original owners, who set them to work again, 
stealthily, at night. 
</P>
<P>
It's been going on that way now for at least 15 years, and, on some nights and 
in some stretches of coastal forest around Gdansk, on land that was seabed a 
few thousand years ago, it is not unusual to find several amber crews at work. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, when the amber hunters used small gasoline-powered pumps, they 
could hear each other. Because the police could hear them, too, the arrest rate 
was bothersome. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we use electric pumps," Andrzej said. "We just tap into a power line, or 
sometimes we take it from some factory. Pay for it? Are you kidding? This is 
state electricity." The pumps now are more powerful, up to 3,500 gallons per 
minute, and almost silent. 
</P>
<P>
"You got a fritz there yet?" said Andrzej, who had found his crew bent over a 
pool of water, raking muck into a long narrow net. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but we hid it," said Karol, the crew chief, a rotund veteran of the 
moonless forest whose crew once hauled out 50 kilograms of amber in one night. 
</P>
<P>
The hose bored a hole about a foot in diameter. One crew member worked the 
pole, up and down. As the pole drew out of the hole, the sand filled in behind 
it, with fresh material, and the pole man pushed the hose down again. After 10 
minutes or so with poor luck, the crew moved to another spot 15 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The pole sank down again. 
</P>
<P>
There was a rattling sound in the water. 
</P>
<P>
It was a clump of dirt. Karol broke it open under the beam of a flashlight and 
handed it to Leszek. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't say I never gave you anything." 
</P>
<P>
The piece of amber was the size of a matchbox, clear on one end. Inside was an 
insect, perhaps an ant. 
</P>
<P>
"Take care of him," Andrzej said. "He's been trying to get out of there for 40 
million years."

<TEXT>
<P>
This is one of those all-too-rare good-news stories about the environment in 
our industrial age. 
</P>
<P>
The subject: acid rain, a phenomenon plaguing many developed countries of 
Europe and North America, and a particular sore spot for at least a decade in 
relations between Canada and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians believe that about 7,000 lakes in Ontario province alone have become 
so acidic, largely from U.S. pollution sources, that most of the fish in them 
have died. Other studies -- not all of them conclusive -- suggest that acid 
rain is shrinking the eastern Canadian duck population, killing off vast 
swathes of maple trees and turning proud marble edifices into spongy masses 
that can be sliced with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials have complained bitterly that in killing the fish, acid rain 
is also strangling one of the few successful industries in rocky and 
undeveloped north-central Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Acidic lakes look unnaturally lovely -- "like your average swimming pool, 
aquamarine blue and clear," says Michael Perley, secretary-treasurer of the 
Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain. But tourists come to this part of Canada to 
fish, not to admire blue waters. And the reason the lakes look so crystalline 
is that nothing can live in them. "If you snorkel in one, there's nothing but a 
mat of filamentous algae on the bottom," says Perley. "At a quick glance, it 
sort of looks like Astroturf." 
</P>
<P>
Research on hospitalizations in southern Ontario show that more people are 
treated for emphysema, bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory problems 
during the summer acid rain season than at other times of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such hazards, Canadians say, the United States has resisted pressure to 
take corrective action for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, even some of this country's most outspoken environmental critics 
have changed their tune. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that this is going to be the year for acid rain control in the United 
States," says Perley, whose group has done more than any other to channel this 
country's exasperation with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Perley and others base their optimism on pollution control measures that would 
be required under the U.S. Senate's version of the Clean Air Act, which is 
expected to become law this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The provisions would mean that the flow of acid rain-causing emissions into 
Canada would be cut in half by the turn of the century -- enough of a change 
that most of this country's acidic lakes could naturally revert to their 
pristine state within five to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The lakes will improve spontaneously," says Peter Dillon, manager of the 
Ontario Ministry of the Environment's aquatics research center in Dorset. "The 
chemistry will revert to its original state, and the biological organisms will 
follow suit, more slowly." 
</P>
<P>
All it takes, he says, is for the polluters to reduce their emission levels, 
and the process will start. 
</P>
<P>
"The movement on acid rain is encouraging," agrees Derek Burney, Canada's 
ambassador to the United States. "It can't help but add an element of 
productivity" to U.S.-Canadian relations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the 1980s, he explains, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 
former President Ronald Reagan spent much of the time they were together mired 
in unproductive haggling over acid rain. With the dispute poised to become 
history, he said, Mulroney and President Bush will have more time to focus on 
broader issues. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians credit their own intensive lobbying, growing understanding of the 
problem and dramatic differences in outlook between the Bush and Reagan White 
Houses. And while optimistic, they stress that more can still be done. 
</P>
<P>
Even after most of Canada's dead lakes revive, they say, one-third or more of 
them will still be dangerously acidic. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll still be pushing for even more emission controls in the future," says 
Dillon. "We want more than two-thirds of the lakes to recover. We'd like to be 
up in the neighborhood of 95%." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he says, the outlook is vastly better than it was not long ago, when 
Canadians feared it would take 40 years before their waters could sustain fish 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1986, Canadians were putting all their hopes into dumping crushed 
limestone -- which neutralizes acid just like an enormous dose of Rolaids -- 
into their lakes. But experiments showed that the cost was impossibly high: 
$80,000 for a medium-sized lake. Thousands of lakes needed treatment, and the 
process would have to be repeated every few years. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians have been worrying about acid rain since the 1970s. And early on, 
they had American support. Scientists in both countries knew that a number of 
lakes on both sides of the border were becoming too acidic to sustain life, and 
they believed there was a connection between the acidity and the burning of 
fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists didn't understand the link fully, but even so, then-President 
Jimmy Carter's Environmental Protection Agency was concerned enough to sign a 
memorandum of understanding with Canada, appoint technical experts and begin 
negotiating an acid-rain treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The process went off track with Carter's loss to Reagan in 1980, however. 
Reagan's EPA appointed new acid-rain negotiators, and government attention 
turned from environmentalism to economics. With so much uncertainty about the 
causes of acid rain, the new technicians said, it would be a mistake to spend 
vast sums of money on a cleanup. What if industry were forced to lavish 
millions on cleanup methods that didn't work? 
</P>
<P>
The new approach definitely saved money for industry, but it cost the United 
States dearly in good relations with its northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan-era negotiators did little but go through the motions for a couple of 
years, said Kai Millyard, policy director of Friends of the Earth in Ottawa. 
"Then the whole (treaty process) was shut down at the end of 1982," Millyard 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans did have a point, though, when they said there was risk in 
attacking the problem with a bad solution. Acid rain is itself the result of an 
earlier attempt to solve the air-pollution woes of America's rust belt. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, power plants and factories burning fossil fuels had relatively short 
smokestacks; the sulfur dioxide they emitted used to hang low over the 
landscape, rusting cars and ruining house paint. Pressured to solve the 
problem, the power plants built very tall smokestacks in an effort to shoot the 
sulfur dioxide high into the atmosphere, where it supposedly would harmlessly 
disperse. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dispersing, though, the sulfur dioxide entered the massive weather 
systems of the upper Midwest and was ferried across the continent for hundreds 
of miles. At some point, high in the atmosphere, it underwent chemical 
reactions -- this is the stage scientists don't fully understand -- and turned 
into sulfuric acid. It then came raining or snowing down onto the landscape, 
far from the source. 
</P>
<P>
Acid precipitation has showered down on both countries, but it does more damage 
to Canada than to the United States because Canada was glaciated long ago and 
lacks America's abundant topsoil. In much of the United States, soils 
neutralize the acid rainfall so that the runoff going into its lakes does not 
poison the fish. In vast reaches of Canada, however, the rain falls on granite 
and run straight into lakes. 
</P>
<P>
In the early part of the 1980s, much of Canada's acid-rain lobbying was aimed 
at restarting the treaty negotiations Carter's EPA had begun. But it failed. 
</P>
<P>
It ultimately took a presidential election, and the inauguration of George 
Bush, to nudge things off dead center. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is an outdoors person," says Casey Padgett, legislative counsel at 
Environmental Action in Washington. "He is a fisherman. For a Republican, he's 
sort of in the Theodore Roosevelt mold. So it's not surprising that on the 
environment, acid rain should be the thing he cares about." 
</P>
<P>
Acid Rain: How it Happens, Why it Kills 
</P>
<P>
1. Sources of oxides: Tall smokestacks spread pollutants high in the 
atmosphere, where they react with water vapor in clouds to form drops of dilute 
acid. 
</P>
<P>
2. Oxides form acids in clouds: Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are products 
of combustion processes. 
</P>
<P>
3. Winds blow acid-laden clouds: Prevailing winds can carry acid-laden clouds 
hundreds of miles, until they meet high altitudes or cold air and drop their 
mosture in acid rain or snow. 
</P>
<P>
4. Acid's killing effects...:...are intensified when acids are trapped in 
winter snow, are released in bursts during spring thaw and build up in lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Higher acidity kills algae, leaving lake water clear. 
</P>
<P>
Aluminum, leached from soil by acids, kills fish by causing gills to clog. 
</P>
<P>
Dilute acid from rain and snow concentrates in streams. 
</P>
<P>
Acid lowers pH of soil, killing trees and plants in some areas.

THOSE VITAL AMERICAN BARGAINING CHIPS IN THE PHILIPPINES

The News: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Philippine negotiators will meet next Monday in Manila for what are 
called "exploratory talks" on the future of six U.S. military facilities in the 
country. . . . They include Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, two of the 
Pentagon's largest overseas bases. . . . President Corazon Aquino's government 
has asked for the talks before any renegotiation of current leases, which 
expire in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Background: 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Washington and Manila are unusually strained. . . . In 
December, U.S. Air Force jets from Clark helped save Aquino's government by 
pinning down attacking rebel planes near Manila during an attempted military 
coup. . . . But after critics said she was thus "beholden" to Washington, 
Aquino abruptly canceled a meeting in February with visiting U.S. Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney, angering the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine politicians, meanwhile, are furious that Congress has refused to 
appropriate $96 million pledged under the current two-year, $962-million lease 
agreement. . . . Despite the shortfall, the United States claims that aid to 
Manila has exceeded commitments over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
At Issue: 
</P>
<P>
The bases are considered crucial for U.S. military operations in the Pacific 
and Indian oceans. . . . Clark is headquarters for the 13th Air Force, with 
tactical fighter and airlift wings. Subic is home for the 7th Fleet and is a 
giant training, supply and repair depot. . . . About 12,000 U.S. troops are 
stationed in the Philippines; with civilian employees and families, the number 
rises to 40,000. . . . U.S. officials say the bases also provide jobs for 
68,000 Filipinos and pump $1 billion into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Manila says the money isn't enough. Also, opponents see the bases as a vestige 
of the time when the Philippines was a U.S. colony. . . . They blame the bases 
for spreading AIDS, prostitution and other social ills. And they argue that the 
bases make the Philippines a more likely target for nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
Forces: 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the bases dominates Manila's newspapers, campuses and coffee 
shops like few other issues. . . . Although polls have shown that a majority of 
Filipinos support the bases, prominent politicians, church leaders and 
editorial writers are calling for the United States to pull out or sharply 
reduce operations. . . . Anti-base sentiment is strong in the 23-member 
Philippine Senate, which must ratify a new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The White House faces other pressures at home. A budget-strapped Congress, 
increasingly sour on Aquino's government, is unlikely to up the ante for 
Manila, given competing demands from new democracies in Eastern Europe. And as 
the Soviet Union cuts its military forces worldwide, Pentagon strategists are 
re-examining the U.S. role in the Pacific. . . . Military officials who long 
insisted that the bases were vital to hold communism in check now say they are 
necessary to protect shipping lanes for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Personalities: 
</P>
<P>
President Aquino says she is keeping her "options open" on the bases. Her hand 
is strengthened since she insists she won't run for reelection in 1992, thus 
reducing domestic political pressure. . . . Her foreign minister, Raul 
Manglapus, will lead the talks. He is a smooth, savvy diplomat who has written 
an anti-bases musical called "Yankee Panky." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Asian defense specialist Richard Armitage has been named special 
negotiator to head the U.S. team. . . . Armitage, 45, is a former assistant 
secretary of defense for international security affairs. . . . Embassy 
officials said the talks may last several months; a joint review, rather than 
renegotiation, of the agreement in 1988 took seven months. 
</P>
<P>
Scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
* The leases will simply be extended with no changes; this is considered very 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
* There will be more joint use of the bases, as in NATO countries and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. forces will partially redeploy, particularly from Clark Air Base. The 
Pentagon has already studied possible alternatives for the Air Force in 
Singapore, Guam, Saipan and Tinian. 
</P>
<P>
* The United States will carry out a phased withdrawal, spread over five to 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
* In a combination of some of the above steps, the United States will slowly 
cut back its presence.

SMUGGLING A BANNED COMMODITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PRETORIA, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa is accustomed to inconvenience. Decades of isolation in sports and 
business have made resourcefulness a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
In sports, the boycotts and bans have also engendered a sophisticated level of 
cheating among some sportsmen, those who have learned to use subterfuge to get 
what the world would deny them. 
</P>
<P>
They use bribery and corruption. They buy passports, change names and blur 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
It is no great surprise that money greases the wheels of this international 
intrigue. The formula runs something like this: Someone wants help. Someone 
emerges who can help. Someone provides help and is well paid. Repeat procedure. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of South African athletes who seek to compete outside the country, 
Paul Coetser is someone who helps. Coetser, an unassuming fellow, and his 
partner, Tony McKeever, run SportsMark, South Africa's largest, and possibly 
its only, sports management company. The two represent dozens of amateur and 
professional athletes in South Africa and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Coetser, who says that other areas of the business provide the profit, 
estimates that his company has spent half a million rand to get South African 
athletes into international competition since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know what we have made out of athletes?" he says. "Let's be 
extravagant. Let's say we have made 50,000 rand (about $22,000). From all the 
athletes. Athletes owe us about 300,000 rand, according to our contracts. I am 
being as honest as I can be. About 50,000 rand." 
</P>
<P>
So why does Coetser do this? Why is he so helpful? 
</P>
<P>
According to SportsMark's contracts, as the agent, Coetser would receive 15% to 
30% of an athlete's earnings. For that cut, Coetser delivers professional, 
expert service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GOING TO SEE THE CHIEF 
</P>
<P>
They call Lesotho, an independent country surrounded by South Africa, "the 
Kingdom in the Sky" because of its mountainous terrain. If you know where you 
are going, it is a most welcoming place. If you are from outside, you might 
well lose your way. 
</P>
<P>
Three people had been following a guide for more than an hour, hiking though 
the mountains, trying to find a river near a particular village. Coetser and 
Annette Falkson, who is white and one of South Africa's best women marathon 
runners, were on their way to see the chief. Johan Fourie, a South African 
1,500-meter runner, had come along to help. 
</P>
<P>
At last they came to the river, which was swollen with rain and looked, from 
the high bank, unfordable. The guide set off, eventually returning with a man 
and a mule. 
</P>
<P>
"You must give this man some money for his mule and he will take you across," 
the guide said. 
</P>
<P>
This ferry system took still more time, as the man carefully picked his way 
across the rocky riverbed, sitting on the back of his mule, taking first one 
passenger then another. 
</P>
<P>
Wet, but finally on the other side, they set out again. At last they found the 
village and sat to wait for the chief. After a time the chief arrived and they 
all went to his kraal, where they sat in a circle. Coetser told the chief that 
he had come from afar to seek the chief's wisdom on a certain matter. 
</P>
<P>
The matter, he said, involved one of the chief's people, a girl who had grown 
up in this village. He told the chief he had brought this girl, now a woman, 
before him to identify. 
</P>
<P>
Coetser told the chief that if he confirmed that the woman and her parents 
before her had come from this area, then this woman could get a birth 
certificate, which was very important to her. 
</P>
<P>
The chief thought about this. They continued to sit and smoked a pipe for a 
time. Then someone brought some of the chief's home-brewed beer. They drank 
that. The chief said he wasn't sure he could remember this one woman from among 
so many people in his village. 
</P>
<P>
Coetser said he understood how an elder with such responsibilities could have 
this problem. Coetser pulled out a bill. The chief thought about this. Coetser 
pulled out another bill. The chief peered at Falkson. The more money Coetser 
extracted from his pocket, the more the chief seemed to recognize Falkson. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of Coetser's money, the chief suddenly recalled that Falkson and 
her blood kin had been respected residents of his village for generations. More 
money. He remembered her as a baby. 
</P>
<P>
A little later, Coetser and his party left the chief and his village, found the 
river, the man and his mule and descended from the Kingdom in the Sky. 
</P>
<P>
It took Coetser nine months and a considerable amount of money to set up that 
trip. But he walked away from the deal with exactly what he had wanted -- a 
Lesotho passport and birth certificate for Falkson, a South African citizen. 
</P>
<P>
It was a triumph of persistence and ingenuity, but it was more than that. Those 
simple documents were the ticket to Falkson's athletic freedom. Freedom that 
she bought, with the help of Coetser, South Africa's foremost practitioner of 
the fine art of getting out. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how he did it. The birth certificate came first. Falkson was not born in 
Lesotho, but a woman with her name was. Coetser knew this because he had 
examined the Lesotho Registry of Births. For that privilege he'd had to bribe 
an official. Coetser now had a registration of Falkson's birth. 
</P>
<P>
To get a birth certificate he had to show proof that Falkson was born where the 
Registry had recorded. The helpful chief solved that problem. 
</P>
<P>
With the document from the chief, Falkson could get a birth certificate. With 
that, she could apply for a Lesotho passport. 
</P>
<P>
She bought the passport and tried to use it as proof of citizenship to run in 
the 1988 L.A. Marathon. At the 11th hour, she wasn't allowed to run because she 
was recognized by U.S. track officials as a South African. 
</P>
<P>
Postscript: Falkson is still living and competing in South Africa and has not 
tried to use the Lesotho passport again. 
</P>
<P>
If South Africa ever becomes socially acceptable to the sports world and its 
athletes are free to compete internationally, Coetser's contracts will increase 
dramatically in value. Making, of course, more money for Coetser. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, he has little fear of the international rules that are supposed to 
keep South Africans from participating in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, that is a joke," said Coetser, a recreational runner who has entered 
international races under assumed names. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you the number of big races we have run in the U.S. and 
everywhere else. We have people registered with TAC, we are members of the New 
York Road Racing Club. I try to run as many races under as many names as I can, 
to get a name established (and pass on to other South Africans). So when race 
directors ask where my athletes have run, we can show results. I have run many 
times under women's names." 
</P>
<P>
Running a race under a woman's name is a radical departure for this former 
schoolteacher. Coetser used to be the classic mild-mannered 
scholar-with-thick-glasses type, and he is at a loss to explain his eager dive 
into the depths of international intrigue. A staunch family man and outward 
conservative, Coetser is a puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
Coetser might seem bold when he scoffs at international rules. But he has 
reason to hold them in low regard -- he has broken them so many times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AN AUDIENCE WITH THE KING 
</P>
<P>
It started when Fourie, the 1,500-meter runner, came to Coetser one day in 1983 
and said he had heard he could get Swazi citizenship in time to compete in the 
1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
They took a day trip to Swaziland, another small country almost totally 
surrounded by South Africa, and met with the head of the country's sports 
council. They were told that, yes, it would not be difficult for such a fine 
runner to represent Swaziland at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
They went another time and met with officials of the country's track and field 
federation. On still another trip, they talked to the Swazi Olympic Committee. 
After about six months of introductions, Coetser began noticing that the more 
Swazi officials he met, the more it was costing him. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it paid off. Fourie and two other South African athletes finally 
received Swazi passports for a total of about 50 rand, about $22. Much cheaper 
than meeting officials. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the passports were not enough. The L.A. Olympics had come and gone and 
still Fourie didn't have his citizenship, and they were running out of money. 
They had bribed officials to get residence permits, about 1,200 rand. But 
residence permits were not the same as citizenship papers, and without those 
they could not go abroad to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Coetser was becoming angry. It was time to see the King. 
</P>
<P>
After three months of negotiations, they arrived at the appointed time for the 
audience. They waited. The King, a teen-ager, never showed. The King's 
counselors had little to say to Coetser about this. This sometimes happens, 
they told him. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Coetser invited a few members of the Swaziland Olympic Committee to 
dinner. Twenty-five "officials" showed up. The next morning as he was checking 
out of his hotel, he noticed a discrepancy in his bill. It seems that his 
dinner guests had checked into eight hotel rooms and charged their expenses to 
his account. 
</P>
<P>
Postscript: Coetser still has the three passports, which he keeps as souvenirs. 
They have never been used. He still does not have the Swazi citizenship papers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paul Coetser, an Afrikaner who was raised in arch-conservative Pretoria and who 
loudly condemns apartheid, argues that his sometimes shady methods have been 
forced upon him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you know how desperate we are," he said. "I am doing what I 
believe is good for the individual athlete in this country. The isolation is 
horrible. They have hit this country where it hurts the most -- at sports. The 
day they started the sports campaign, that was the best angle they ever had 
against apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the time has come to stop. The world must meet the sportsman halfway. 
The athletes, black and white, are suffering because the politicians can't make 
up their damn minds. Athletes have been taken as instruments and shoved around 
for many years. Today they are simply instruments in the hands of politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Coetser recalls with some pride that he was once the most hated man in South 
African sports. Now, he said, officials are coming to see his methods as less 
radical and more practical. 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't want to continue to break the rules. He said he is only 
telling his story now because of the changing political climate in South Africa 
and because, "It's time for people to know what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, there are many ways of doing it," he said. "It's all done 
because of desperation and a burning desire to run internationally. If I really 
want to, I can keep doing it. If they catch us, they catch us. We can just come 
back next time and do it under different names. It's very expensive, but we can 
find the money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DO YOU KNOW THE WAY TO PARAGUAY? 
</P>
<P>
It was called Project Genesis. The name symbolized the beginning of a new 
approach by Coetser, a desperate, try-anything attempt to get South African 
athletes into international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Coetser picked the Honolulu Marathon because it fit well into the schedule. It 
was also off the beaten path, and that was a key. 
</P>
<P>
Coetser called Larry Heidebrecht, a sports agent he met at the 1987 World 
Championships at Rome. Heidebrecht knew Coetser as Paul Stevens, a name Coetser 
used when he didn't want to be identified as a South African. Coetser told 
Heidebrecht that he had two marathon runners from Paraguay and he wanted to get 
them into the Honolulu Marathon. Heidebrecht said he would call the race 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The two runners were entered 10 days before the race, with modest times. The 
race director, Jim Barahal, agreed that the runners would pay their own way to 
the race and he would provide hotel rooms. In addition, Barahal agreed that if 
one of the runners finished in the top three, the race would then pay the 
transportation of the coach. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Heidebrecht called to say that only one runner, Brandt Nava, would 
compete, that the other was not ready. The truth was that Coetser wasn't sure 
he could get passports for two runners. 
</P>
<P>
Nava got there, but quite late. He, his coach and Coetser arrived at 5 p.m. the 
day before the race, only 12 hours before race time. Coetser introduced himself 
to Barahal as Paul Stefanos, a Greek national living in London. Nava's real 
name was David Tsebe. He was a young welfare officer in a platinum mine, a 
South African. 
</P>
<P>
Coetser and Tsebe kept to themselves before the race and even Barahal said he 
didn't notice Tsebe-Nava until about six miles into the race. The runner was 
among the leaders and looking strong. He led at nine miles. At 15 miles Gianni 
Poli of Italy made a break. Nava went with him, still in the lead. Poli caught 
him at 22 1/2 miles and Nava settled in behind him. To most, Nava looked fresh 
and Poli was laboring. 
</P>
<P>
Poli won and Nava was second in 2 hours 15 minutes 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Nava clearly threw the race, on Coetser's instructions. Awaiting 
the winner were many inquiring eyes and a national television audience. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reporters was runner Alberto Salazar, who was doing television 
commentary. Salazar, who speaks Spanish, approached Nava for an interview. 
Salazar spoke Spanish to Nava, supposedly a Paraguayan whose native language 
would have been Spanish. Nava didn't appear to understand. Salazar spoke to him 
in English, with no response. 
</P>
<P>
The charade unraveled quickly. It became apparent that Stefanos and Nava 
weren't who they said they were and were neither Greek nor Paraguayan. After 
agreeing to meet Barahal to discuss the situation, the South Africans left 
Honolulu abruptly. Barahal was left with a hotel bill that included $258 worth 
of phone calls to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Postscript: Coetser still has the Paraguayan passports. He still has two checks 
for $5,000, Brandt Nava's prize money. The checks have never been cashed. 
</P>
<P>
Post-Postscript: How did Coetser get the Paraguayan passports? That's still 
another story. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a government project to sell farms in northern Paraguay to 
investors," he said. "Part of the deal was that I could get passports. I went 
there and I said, OK, I'll buy one farm for $20,000 U.S. I was supposed to get 
four passports. Well, at the end of the day, I only paid 5,000 rand and I got 
the passports. I got a registered number and the farm address." 
</P>
<P>
Coetser said he had little trouble registering the names, all false, of South 
African athletes with the Paraguayan track and field federation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is corruption out there like you cannot believe," he said. "Anything is 
possible with money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Because of its policy of apartheid, or racial separation, South Africa has been 
shunned by the international sporting community. It has been banned from the 
Olympics since 1960 and international sporting codes prohibit South African 
athletes from competing anywhere outside their country and impose lengthy bans 
on any athlete who competes in South Africa.

PEREZ GIVES MARTINEZ A LESSON;

<P>
BOXING: WBC BANTAMWEIGHT CHAMPION GETS NINTH-ROUND TKO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raul Perez took an unbeaten and tenacious challenger to boxing school Monday 
night and retained his World Boxing Council bantamweight championship with a 
ninth-round technical knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, at 5 feet 11 the second tallest bantamweight champion ever, bounced 
short, countering right hands off 5-5 Gerardo Martinez's head for eight rounds, 
then ended the fight with his right late in the ninth round of the 12-round 
bout, before 5,652 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
His fifth successful defense of the title gave the Tijuana fighter a 46-1 
record, a $50,000 purse and perhaps a down-the-road title fight with another 
Forum favorite, WBC super-bantamweight champion Paul Banke. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Perez mockingly described Martinez as "just another short guy" while 
preparing for the fight. And that's pretty much how he fought him, patiently 
picking his spots for quick, jolting right hands over Martinez's lefts. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez (24-1) earned $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
The challenger, from San Jose, had a rocky first few rounds, during which his 
shoes weren't gripping the ring's mat. He couldn't plant himself against Perez, 
who took full advantage of Martinez's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Between rounds early in the fight, Martinez's cornermen shaved strips off the 
soles of his shoes and his footing seemed to improve. Unfortunately for him, so 
did Perez's counter-punching. 
</P>
<P>
The champion's countering blows slowly took their toll. By the eighth round, 
because of his inability to block Perez's rights, he slowed considerably. 
Martinez's marks included a bloody mouth and a couple of lumps on the left side 
of his face. 
</P>
<P>
By the eighth, Martinez's only hope seemed to be that one of his wild, flailing 
punches would catch Perez and knock him out. 
</P>
<P>
He was still a dangerous opponent, charging forward continually to throw 
punches to the head and body. But now, he was tiring just enough so that Perez 
could see them coming. 
</P>
<P>
Perez began loading up. His opponent was still charging ahead, but he was 
becoming easier to hit for the mobile, quick-hitting Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the ninth, Perez caught Martinez with a three-punch combination that 
stopped him in his tracks. Then the finisher. It was a big right hand that 
caught Martinez flush on the left side of his face. He fell to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
He arose, and caught a breather when referee Hank Elespuru ordered Perez to 
return to the neutral corner. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was on his man quickly, finishing him with a solid combination that 
decked Martinez again. Elespuru stopped the fight, with one second left in the 
ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
The judges had Perez ahead after eight by margins of 79-74, 77-74 and 77-76. 
The Times scored every round for Perez except the third, when Elespuru deducted 
a point from him for a low blow. 
</P>
<P>
The fighters clashed heads often, and one collision, in the fourth, resulted in 
scalp cut for Martinez. Perez finished unmarked, save for a nick below his left 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I had bad shoes, I had no traction, it made me lose confidence in myself," 
Martinez said. "It was the main problem in the fight. I had no leverage." 
</P>
<P>
Said Perez: "When you lose, you search for excuses." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I can still make 118, but I want to move up to 122 and fight Banke, 
here at the Forum. Of course, that depends on what happens in Korea." 
</P>
<P>
Banke defends his title on June 9 against Lee Heung-Soon in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, San Fernando heavyweight Alex Garcia knocked out 6-5, 
270-pound Bill Duncan in the first round. Garcia (225) knocked down the inept 
Duncan twice and it was over at 1:55. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most exciting fight on the card was the six-rounder between Kenyan 
Steve Mwema and John Ramirez of Oxnard. In a bloody three-rounder, Mwema scored 
a TKO at 1:53 of the third.

MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE TO BE SOUGHT IN CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: FORMER RAM LINEMAN DOUG FRANCE IS ACCUSED OF BEING DRUNK BEFORE FATAL 
ACCIDENT. 
</P>

<P>
The California Highway Patrol said Monday it will seek a vehicular manslaughter 
charge against Doug France, a former Ram offensive lineman who was involved in 
a two-car accident Saturday that left a Laguna Hills woman dead. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspect that France was drunk when his 1987 BMW rammed head-on 
into a car driven by Maria Conception Contreras, 53, in south Orange County, 
CHP Officer Patrick Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was France's neighbor in a townhouse complex. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 4:35 p.m., shortly after France, 37, left his 
Laguna Hills home and drove north along Aliso Hills Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling at speeds estimated by police at 80 m.p.h., France apparently lost 
control of his car on a curve near La Cienega Street and collided with 
Contreras' Mazda, Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers arrested France at the scene, but released him to Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Police said results of a 
blood-alcohol test will be available in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokeswoman said France was in serious condition with a concussion 
and broken pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
France, a former star at Ohio State, played for the Rams from 1975-81. He was 
selected as an all-pro in 1978 and 1980. DAVAN MAHARAJ

AFTER A SEASON OF IMPROVEMENT, THE SUNS ARE SET IN THEIR WEST; 
</P>
<P>
NBA PLAYOFFS: CENTER NOW STAYS CLOSE TO THE BASKET -- AND LEADS THE LEAGUE IN 
SHOOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surname is appropriate, because Mark West knows how important direction and 
location have been to his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Suns are the fourth team he has played for in the seven years since 
he left Old Dominion University. In his first 4 1/2 seasons, he was with Dallas 
(34 games), then Milwaukee (11 days) and then Cleveland (until Feb. 25, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-10 center, he went to Phoenix from Cleveland in a trade that also 
brought Kevin Johnson to the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
The trade, along with the signing of free agent Tom Chambers, helped put the 
Suns among the NBA elite. Except that West was not the centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has developed, but West has improved beyond expectation. No one 
mentions his name among the best big men of the game, but certainly he makes a 
difference inside. The Suns' first-round series victory over Utah bears that 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Game 1: Seven rebounds, four points. 
</P>
<P>
Game 2: 14 points, 21 rebounds to tie a club record for a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Game 3: 18 points, 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Game 4: Six points, 11 rebounds, five blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Game 5: Six points, 11 rebounds, five blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously he made a difference in this series," said Utah's Karl Malone, who 
spent much of the time battling West. "He's one of those guys who just keeps 
working and working. You can say what you want to, but he was probably the key 
to their series." 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, who open a best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series against 
the Lakers at the Forum tonight, have more prominent players, such as Chambers, 
Johnson and Jeff Hornacek. Why doesn't West receive more acclaim? 
</P>
<P>
"I get a pay check," West said. "That's credit enough." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons won't leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone talks about Hornacek being our most improved player, but he is the 
most underrated. The most improved player is Mark West, because he had so far 
to come. Mark West wasn't a basketball player before. Now he is. 
</P>
<P>
"He has made strides every year. A year ago, we never would have thought about 
getting him to the basket this much. Now, we go to him as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The key is location -- never more than five feet away from the basket. The 
simple strategy of knowing his range is unspectacular -- but successful beyond 
what anyone could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Check out the league leaders in field goal percentage: Charles Barkley, Robert 
Parish, Malone -- all behind Mark West. His mark of 62.5% is the best since 
Steve Johnson shot 63.2% for San Antonio in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's something I'm concerned with a lot, how far I've come," 
said West, who began the season as a 56.5% career shooter. "I always just try 
to be better than the year before and better than the day before. The biggest 
thing is that I'm helping the team now on offense, not hurting them." 
</P>
<P>
The only Sun to play all 82 games, West also finished eighth in the league in 
blocked shots, averaging 2.24, and 17th in rebounding at 8.9. But the numbers 
he would rather talk about are his worst. 
</P>
<P>
His 69.1% free-throw accuracy, atrocious by some standards, was his career 
high. 
</P>
<P>
"When you improve to 69%, you know you had to be bad," West said, shaking his 
head and smiling. "If that's improvement, you know the depths where I've come 
from." 
</P>
<P>
In his 34 games as a rookie with the Bucks, he shot 31.8%. The next season, in 
66 games with Milwaukee and Cleveland, 49.4%. For the next five seasons, he 
remained in the 50% range. 
</P>
<P>
West credits Johnson, a close friend, for helping him with free throws. The two 
shot for hours a day during the most recent off-season in Phoenix, but Johnson 
would only count as good the shots that had enough arc. Johnson was the judge 
on that, too. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, West's free-throw shooting has improved. As has his entire game.

The Australian Open, long considered the least prestigious of tennis' four 
major titles, could lose its Grand Slam status unless prize money is sharply 
increased, the tournament's general manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reid said the tournament was having a hard time matching the purses offered 
by the three other Grand Slam events -- Wimbledon, the French Open and the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Wimbledon offered $5.2 million, followed by the U.S. Open with $5.1 
million, the French Open with $4.5 million and the Australian Open with $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Wimbledon is offering $6.4 million -- more than double the 
Australian purse.

PEREZ UNLIKELY TO MAKE U.S. WORLD CUP TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Midfielder Hugo Perez probably will not be named to the 22-man roster that will 
play for the U.S. national soccer team at the World Cup, which begins one month 
from today in Italy, U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez recently resumed training after breaking a bone in his right leg in March 
while playing for a team in France's second division. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible, but not likely," Gansler said when asked about Perez's 
prospects for joining the team in Italy. "Hugo is a very gifted player, one who 
we would like to have as part of our World Cup squad. But we still don't know 
for sure when he would be ready to play full out. At this point, it is not 
likely that he would be part of our 22-man squad." 
</P>
<P>
Because of injuries, Perez played in only two of the World Cup qualifying games 
between July, 1988 and November, 1989. Since July, 1988, he has played in five 
of 27 international matches. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Soccer Federation also announced that Roy Wegerle, an English first 
division player for Queens Park Rangers who is married to an American, will not 
receive his U.S. citizenship until July and will not be eligible to play for 
the United States in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The United States resumes preparation the World Cup Wednesday night with an 
exhibition game in Hershey, Pa., against Poland. RANDY HARVEY

ONE STANLEY CUP IN THREE YEARS NOT ENOUGH AS FLAMES FIRE CRISP

<P>
Terry Crisp, who led the Calgary Flames to their first Stanley Cup championship 
last year, found out Monday that the present often counts more than the past. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp was fired after three seasons as coach and less than a month after the 
defending champions were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>

"It is the feeling of our organization that to maximize the potential of our 
hockey club . . . it necessitates a change of coach," General Manager Cliff 
Fletcher said in announcing the move, which had been speculated upon since the 
Flames lost to the Kings in six games. 
</P>
<P>
No replacement was named. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a person in mind," said Fletcher, who has fired only two other coaches 
in his 18 years as Calgary's general manager. "I'm not going to speculate or 
play 20 questions on who may or may not be a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Crisp didn't attend the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
In three years as coach, Crisp guided the Flames to a 144-63-33 record, two 
Presidents' trophies for finishing first overall during the regular season and 
last year's Stanley Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp was twice nominated for coach of the year and has two years remaining on 
his contract. He played 11 seasons in the NHL with Boston, St. Louis, the New 
York Islanders and Philadelphia, where he played on Stanley Cup champions in 
1974 and '75. 
</P>
<P>
He was an assistant to Fred Shero for two seasons with the Flyers, then won 
three Ontario Hockey League championships with Sault Ste. Marie.

Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain overcame fast greens and a distracting duck to win 
a PGA European golf tournament by a stroke over Ian Woosnam of Wales at St. 
Mellion, England. 
</P>
<P>
Olazabal sank a difficult downhill putt on the final hole and won $96,000, but 
only after he had twice marked his ball. 
</P>

"There was a female duck moving about on my line and I waited, hoping she would

AREA S&amp;LS, BANKS ENJOY HEALTHY FIRST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first three months of 1990, savings &amp; loans in the area stretching 
from Glendale to Oxnard turned in their best overall performance in more than 
two years in a surge in profits that even swept up troubled Valley Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, area banks had a good quarter as well, with Independence Bank 
leading the way, followed by traditionally strong performers like Levy Bancorp 
and TransWorld Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
Changing interest-rate conditions were behind the performances of both banks 
and S&amp;Ls. The two types of financial institutions operate differently in 
how they buy money -- mostly through deposits -- and how they turn around and 
invest it, mostly through loans. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are generally more able to maintain profits as interest rates change, 
because interest rates on bank loans usually adjust quickly along with their 
costs of attracting and keeping deposits. And other things being equal, banks 
can often thrive on higher interest rates, because checking accounts -- a large 
portion of their deposits -- often don't pay interest at all. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) that constitute a large 
portion of most S&amp;Ls' loan portfolios tend to adjust only slowly to the 
thrifts' borrowing costs. That means that when market interest rates rise -- 
pushing up S&amp;Ls' borrowing costs -- their profits often erode because the 
interest rates they charge on loans don't quickly catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, a year ago, interest rates that were dramatically higher than in 1988 
pushed up bank profits but squeezed thrifts severely. 
</P>
<P>
But in this year's first quarter, market rates were lower than a year ago. For 
example, the federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other on 
overnight loans -- had fallen to under 8.5% from around 10% a year before. So 
the interest rates on the thrifts' adjustable-rate mortgages, which were slowly 
climbing, finally caught up with the thrifts' interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
A good example of the pattern was Citadel Holding Co., the Glendale parent of 
Fidelity Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
On March 31, 1989, Citadel's net interest margin -- the S&amp;L's yield on its 
loans and investments minus its interest costs on deposits and other borrowings 
-- stood at a mere 1.14%, leaving little room for profits. But on March 31, 
1990, that margin was more than twice as wide, at 2.38%. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by better yields, Citadel's net income in the first quarter thus 
increased 141% from a year earlier to $7.3 million, even while the thrift's 
assets increased only 5% to $5 billion as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel C. McCarver, chief financial officer of Citadel, said the thrift even 
reaped the benefits of falling interest rates in the first quarter. "Our ARM 
loans move down slowly at a time when interest rates are dropping somewhat 
faster," McCarver said. "When the rates are coming down, we definitely enjoy 
the lag." 
</P>
<P>
In a key measure of profitability, however, Citadel showed some room for 
improvement. A return on average assets (ROA) of 1% is considered excellent, 
but Citadel's first-quarter return on average assets was only 0.59%. 
</P>
<P>
The return on average assets is calculated by multiplying a bank's or thrift's 
earnings for the quarter by four to get an annual figure, then dividing by the 
bank's average assets during the period to get the rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
Even Valley Federal, which lost $138 million in 1989, did well in the first 
quarter with its profit soaring to $9.7 million, more than 50 times the level 
of year ago. Although that figure was boosted by a $4.5-million gain from the 
sale of some branches, much of the improved performance was due to better 
interest-rate conditions. Valley Federal's ROA was a respectable 1.30%. 
</P>
<P>
And in a sign that the better results may have impressed regulators, the 
federal government last week approved Valley Federal's plan to boost its 
sagging capital reserves. But the thrift admitted there is virtually no way for 
it to meet capital requirements in the long run without being acquired by 
another thrift or stronger financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Valley Federal's assets shrank 14% from a year before to $2.96 
billion on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Glenfed, the parent of Glendale Federal Bank, also performed well in the period 
ended March 31, which is the thrift's financial third quarter. Glenfed said its 
net income increased 30% to $26.3 million, giving it an ROA of 0.41%. The 
S&amp;L's assets dropped by 2% to $25.5 billion on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Bancorp's results were fairly typical among banks in the region. 
Lincoln is the parent of California United Bank, which recently changed its 
name from Lincoln National Bank to avoid confusion with the loss-plagued 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Lincoln Bancorp thrived on high market interest rates. Yet even 
while rates during the first quarter of 1990 were about 1.25% lower than a year 
ago, Lincoln still managed to perform well, with its net interest margin 
eroding only about 0.25%, said Robert Vecci, chief financial officer of 
Lincoln. That's because Lincoln keeps its interest costs low by concentrating 
on checking account deposits that pay little or no interest. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Lincoln boosted its profit 15% to $1.6 million for the first 
quarter -- in part because its assets soared 26% to $498 million as of March 
31. Lincoln reported an impressive return on average assets of 1.56%. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County National Bancorp, the Oxnard parent of Ventura County National 
Bank and Frontier Bank, had a little more difficulty adjusting to narrowing net 
interest margins for banks. 
</P>
<P>
And Ventura also saw its personnel costs increase -- by as much as $800,000 a 
year compared to costs a year ago -- in order to start up new specialized loan 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ventura's net income for the first quarter inched up 4% to 
$731,000, giving the bank an ROA of 0.94%. Meanwhile, Ventura's assets jumped 
42% to $341 million as of March 31, fueled in part by the acquisition of 
Frontier Bank last October. 
</P>
<P>
Independence Bank in Encino said its net income rose 33% to $1.5 million, and 
the bank's assets increased 21% to $752 million on March 31. Independence had a 
first-quarter ROA of 0.80%. 
</P>
<P>
Levy Bancorp, the Ventura parent of Bank of A. Levy, said its profit increased 
31% to $1.8 million in the first quarter, giving the bank an ROA of 1.26%. Levy 
Bancorp's assets increased 9% to $617 million as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita National Bank, based in Valencia, said its net income slipped 1% 
to $921,000 for the first quarter. But Santa Clarita still turned in a robust 
return on average assets of 1.44% for the period and its assets increased 5% to 
$259 million on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Santa Clarita agreed to be acquired by Security Pacific Corp. for 
about $52.5 million in stock. 
</P>
<P>
TransWorld Bancorp, the Sherman Oaks parent of TransWorld Bank, said its profit 
for the first period increased 24% to $615,000 compared to a year before, 
giving the bank an ROA of 1.18%. Trans-World's assets on March 31 were $218 
million, a 10% increase from a year before. 
</P>
<P>
APSB Bancorp, the North Hollywood parent of American Pacific State Bank, said 
its first-quarter net income rose 18% to $437,000 from a year earlier. APSB's 
return on average assets was 0.92%, and the bank's assets increased 9% from a 
year earlier to $192 million.

Orange County government departments submitted their 1990-91 budget requests 
last week, and as officials took their first look at them, many agreed on one 
thing: Without help from somewhere, it's only a matter of time before the 
county goes broke. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me," said Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth, one of more than 
a dozen state and county officials interviewed for this article, "it won't be 
long before county governments, all 58 counties, crumble. We're looking at a 
very tough time." 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County officials, the litany of budget woes is as long as it is 
familiar. The state keeps cutting back on funding while it mandates new 
programs for counties to administer. At the same time, tax and spending limits 
restrict the county's ability to absorb waves of new residents, and local 
voters adamantly refuse to raise their own taxes. 
</P>
<P>
So county government's pool of available funds -- the money that carries over 
from one year to the next -- shrinks almost every year, and desperate officials 
dig ever deeper into their contingency budget. That buys time but leaves the 
county perilously vulnerable to a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The result: A county that boasts a bigger economic base than many nations and a 
bigger annual budget than some states finds itself on the brink of fiscal 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"If not this year, then next year or the year after, it's going to happen," 
County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said in an interview last week. 
"It will happen eventually unless we get some help from the state or from the 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
And when "it" happens, it won't be pretty. If the budget ax falls, the county 
would face Draconian cutbacks in workers and services to the public. Welfare 
rolls would grow, law enforcement would likely suffer as sheriff's deputies 
were laid off, and park and open space acquisition would probably be frozen. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be very bad," Roth said. "We've had to worry for a couple years about 
laying off 500 to 800 employees, and at the last minute something's come along 
to bail us out. That won't keep happening." 
</P>
<P>
Layoffs would have a particularly stinging effect in Orange County, officials 
say, because the county already has one of the nation's leanest work forces for 
a large county. According to a City and State Magazine survey last year, Orange 
County, which has the nation's fourth largest county budget in terms of general 
fund revenues, ranked 41st in terms of employees per capita. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the problems driving the county's budget toward the precipice is 
that state government, which often creates new programs, requires counties to 
administer them and then gradually whittles away the funding. Counties are then 
required to pick up the slack, even if it means cutting local programs to make 
up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two kinds of counties," State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), 
who chairs the Senate Local Government Committee, said in an interview Friday. 
"Those that are hurting and those that are dying. And in order to get help for 
the ones that are dying, you have to take it from the ones that are hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the shortfalls have grown so acute in some parts of the state that 
governments have already toyed with the idea of throwing in the towel. In 
Northern California's Butte County, for instance, the government last year 
tried to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the day of reckoning is further off but no less inevitable, 
officials here say. 
</P>
<P>
"The mandates hurt us badly, and there's nothing we can do about it," Schneider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Rubino, associate county administrative officer for management and 
budget, ruefully agreed. "It's the hand we're dealt, and we're playing it," he 
said in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
The mandates have triggered another issue for the county government, gradually 
shifting its focus away from land-use and development and toward social 
services such as health care. But state funding for health care programs has 
lagged far behind the growth in demand for those services. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed 1990-91 budget, for instance, slashes aid to 
Orange County health care programs, stripping them of $19.1 million. The state 
requires the county to offer many health services, however, so county officials 
cannot cleave many of the programs to match their budgets from the state. 
</P>
<P>
With the county already facing a projected deficit of more than $20 million 
next year, an additional $19 million hit would likely gut other programs such 
as law enforcement, environmental management or other government services. 
</P>
<P>
For now, county officials are hoping that lobbying efforts in Sacramento will 
reduce the size of the cuts proposed in the governor's budget. 
</P>
<P>
That may or may not be enough to get Orange County over the budget hurdle this 
year. But even if the county clears it one more time, the room to maneuver has 
become so tight that few officials believe the county has more than a year or 
two left before time runs out. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, the county has relied on one-time bonuses such as the sale of 
government property to get through the budget crunch. That has artificially 
created a sense that the government has large reserves to fall back on; 
officials say it does not. 
</P>
<P>
This year's spending will consume about 98% of the government's available 
funds, officials say, leaving almost nothing to roll over into next year. (Los 
Angeles County, the nation's largest, rolled over 3.23% of its budget last 
year, about average for the 50 biggest counties, according to City and State 
Magazine.) 
</P>
<P>
As available funds shrink, the contingency account, which is supposed to be 
held in reserve for emergencies, has increasingly become a pot into which the 
Orange County Supervisors dip when confronted with tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors used to be advised that the contingency fund should never fall 
below $20 million during normal times. At last report, the fund stood at a 
little more than $13 million, and few officials believe it will be replenished 
to $20 million at any time in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a serious problem," said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. "What 
happens if there's an earthquake? How're we going to pay to deal with it if the 
fund is depleted?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer, officials agree, is that the county government quite simply could 
not. 
</P>
<P>
That has left an overriding sense of helplessness in some budget discussions. 
County officials wait nervously to see what the state will do to their 
planning, hoping for the best but knowing to expect the worst. 
</P>
<P>
And it's even forced a reluctant determination among some county leaders to 
bring tax measures before area voters. Whether voters will do it is doubtful, 
as it's been more than 30 years since Orange County residents approved a 
general obligation bond. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the county is facing several high-priority capital spending projects and 
has virtually no money to pay for them. Transportation improvements, new court 
construction and open-space acquisition all have powerful constituencies in the 
county. Moreover, the county is under a court order to relieve jail 
overcrowding, so jail construction cannot be put off forever, either. 
</P>
<P>
County officials proposed this week that a court construction bond be put on 
the November ballot. Backers of a half-cent transportation sales tax are aiming 
for the same election. 
</P>
<P>
Although supervisors worry about loading up that November ballot, even some of 
the county's traditionally conservative Republicans say that the time may have 
come to rethink reflexive opposition to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange, isn't it?" acknowledged Roth, a Republican who often holds forth 
on the virtues of limited government. "But I'll tell you why it is. We're up to 
our elbows in this on a daily basis. The average person just doesn't grasp 
that. They're welcome to come up and give me a helping hand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COUNTY GOVERNMENT'S DWINDLING RESERVES 
</P>
<P>
Desperate to make ends meet with less and less state assistance, Orange County 
officials keep dipping into their contingency fund, a savings account that is 
supposed to be tapped only in emergencies. Though county revenues have annually 
increased, county reserves are declining.

NEW SPRAYING PLAN IS UNVEILED; 
</P>
<P>
INFESTATION: REVISED STRATEGY AGAINST MEDFLY CALLS FOR THREE MORE MALATHION 
TREATMENTS AROUND GARDEN GROVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State agriculture officials, offering the first details of their stepped-up 
attack on the Mediterranean fruit fly, on Monday ordered three more malathion 
treatments around Garden Grove as part of a plan to respray about half of 
Southern California's infested areas. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new schedule that tones down overly optimistic predictions about the 
Medfly battle, about 250 square miles of existing spray zones around Southern 
California will be hit at least once more from the air during May, officials 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
A 36-square-mile area that includes virtually all of Garden Grove, half of 
Westminster, and parts of seven other neighboring cities and is home to about 
400,000 residents is scheduled to be sprayed three more times this month -- 
more additional treatments than any other area. 
</P>
<P>
The frequency of the sprayings will also be stepped up to once a week. 
Sprayings for the Garden Grove region are set for May 16, May 23 and May 30. 
</P>
<P>
With fewer sterile flies available from Hawaii production facilities than 
anticipated, agricultural officials looked for ways of conserving them. The 
Garden Grove region offered that opportunity, officials said, because it 
appears that its treatment may be completed with just a few more sprayings -- 
and without using the sterile flies at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope," said Pat Minyard, deputy director of the Medfly Project in El 
Monte, "is that we can make three treatments (in the Garden Grove area), keep 
trapping and find no more flies, and be able to declare the fly eradicated 
there by December." 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, state agriculture officials had promised to end the 
10-month-old malathion campaign in most parts of Southern California by 
Wednesday. But a series of widespread Medfly finds and a potential shortage of 
sterile Medflies prompted officials to retreat from that plan. 
</P>
<P>
The war, they conceded, had not been won. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-square-mile spray zone around Brea, which last November became the 
first area in Orange County to receive aerial malathion treatments, will not 
get any more applications under the new schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, crews of agricultural workers will release millions of sterile 
Medflies in the North County area to try to breed the crop-attacking pest out 
of existence. That process will likely start around Brea on Thursday, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, spraying will be ended by Wednesday in about 225 square miles around 
Southern California, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, new finds anywhere in the Southland could prompt more sprayings, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barring any more discoveries, the end of May "should be the end of it" for all 
Southern California spray zones outside of the new treatment areas in Riverside 
and San Bernardino counties, where flies have been discovered in recent weeks, 
Minyard said. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the state's controversial, $30-million battle against the Medfly 
were, at the least, skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're not happy with this at all," said Bob Taylor, a Garden Grove 
resident who has helped organize anti-malathion protests in the area and is now 
trying to gather signatures for a statewide ballot initiative to ban such 
sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's going to have any confidence in whatever date (state officials) say 
is going to be the end because they just don't seem to know what they're doing. 
Things are out of control," Taylor said. "It's becoming increasingly evident 
that they're really beating a dead horse -- that the process just doesn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
David Moore, president of the Irvine-based Western Growers Assn., said the new 
strategy put in place Monday has his "100%" backing. But he conceded that the 
announcement will do little to help the already-damaged image of the 
agriculture industry, seen by some as having a stranglehold on state decisions 
through its powerful financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think that we in agriculture wear the white hats, the good guys," 
said Moore, whose group represents 1,300 fresh produce growers and shippers in 
California and Arizona. "But I just hate to see what's happening to us in the 
public eye because it just seems like we're getting pounded." 
</P>
<P>
However, pointing to the threat posed by the Medfly's spread to the Riverside 
area and the prospect of export quarantines, Moore added that malathion 
spraying "is the only proven thing that will work, and I still say we're going 
to win this battle. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Isi Siddiqui, the assistant director of the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture, who two months ago predicted an end to the infestation by June, 
said the situation is now too unpredictable to say when the state will be able 
to eradicate the pest. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the extra sprayings announced Monday for some areas, 34 square 
miles in the City of San Bernardino will have to be repeatedly sprayed with 
malathion through at least June because of the limited supply of sterile flies. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County community of Woodcrest will be sprayed during the summer, 
but only because of the commercial citrus groves in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But with the hot summer months approaching, offering ideal breeding conditions 
for the Medfly, the infestation could grow dramatically in the next few months, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Ashley Dunn contributed to this report. 
</P>

SANTA ANA MAN KILLED BY SHOT FIRED BY FRIEND TRYING TO HELP

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bizarre development, Santa Ana police announced Monday that a 22-year-old 
man fatally wounded while fighting a pack of gun-wielding drug dealers was 
actually shot by a friend who was trying to scare off the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling that the death of Celestino Morales Davila was an accident, police said 
the size of the bullet that struck him in the head indicates that it came from 
a semiautomatic pistol that the friend was attempting to fire into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident of the Southwest neighborhood, Sabino Mena Moreno, 19, was 
wounded during the Saturday afternoon melee, but that also was ruled an 
accident, police said. Mena was apparently struck by pellets from a shotgun 
that another resident had blasted into the air. 
</P>
<P>
In all, police said, four gunshots were fired during the confrontation with a 
group of drug dealers that Morales had chased off West Walnut Street earlier in 
the day -- only to see them return with weapons. None of the shots, however, 
appear to have been fired by the drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas refused to identify the residents 
involved but said no charges will be sought against them because witnesses 
agree that the tragic shootings appeared to be accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Police are continuing to seek the suspected drug dealers, however. Under state 
law, a person can be charged with murder if he or she does something illegal 
that contributes to a death. 
</P>
<P>
"The district attorney will have to decide whether to charge the dealers with 
this crime if they are caught," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Inglehart, chairwoman of Citizens Against Narcotics in Santa Ana, said 
Monday that the drug dealers who terrorize the largely Latino neighborhood are 
to blame for Morales' death. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it was accidental or not," Inglehart said, "it's still drug-related. 
If the drug dealers weren't there, these people wouldn't have to arm 
themselves. There would be no tragedy like this. It's an absolute shame." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Gipson, 67, a resident of the neighborhood for more than 27 years, 
agreed. "The dealers should be charged with some kind of crime because they 
caused (Morales') death," he said. "That young man would still be alive if they 
hadn't started it all." 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday incident began when Morales and four friends chased off a group of 
five drug dealers who, residents say, frequent the 1400 block of West Walnut. 
But minutes later, the dealers returned and, armed with shotguns, surrounded 
Morales, who carried a machete to protect himself. 
</P>
<P>
As some neighbors scattered for cover, Morales' friend fired the semiautomatic 
pistol twice in the air. 
</P>
<P>
When Morales was struck, a witness shouted, "Someone is killing Celestino," 
police spokeswoman Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The other resident then fired his shotgun twice into the air, but some of the 
pellets sprayed Mena, who was treated for superficial wounds at Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo and released. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers then fled. 
</P>
<P>
Morales died Monday at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Gipson, a retired construction worker, said there was a time when the Southwest 
neighborhood was as peaceful as the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, he said, "you can hear gunfire at night and see dealers selling 
right outside on the street corners. They have more business than the bread 
man." 
</P>
<P>
"It's so sad," he said. "People are afraid to leave their houses." 
</P>
<P>
Inglehart called for residents to rise up against the drug dealers and not be 
discouraged by Saturday's violence. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to sit down on their lawn chairs at 5 p.m. with a pencil and pad 
and start marking down these dealers," she said. "Then these criminals can go 
someplace else to sell."

IRVINE TO TAKE UP HOUSING SITE CHOICES;

The city that banned chlorofluorocarbons and passed a human rights ordinance 
may now become one of the first in the state to provide affordable housing for 
hundreds of families earning $32,000 or less per year. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the City Council is scheduled to narrow to three the sites that could 
be chosen as the first for a demonstration development of 100 to 200 
apartments, half of which would be set aside for people who cannot afford homes 
that can be priced at $350,000 or rents that can start at $800 per month. If 
the first project succeeds, there might be two more. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be built by a partnership consisting of two nonprofit 
corporations -- the recently created Irvine Community Housing Corp., and Bridge 
Inc., a San-Francisco-based company that has built more than 3,000 affordably 
priced homes in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
How the project will be paid for will be determined later, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Other nonprofit corporations have built a total of about 100 units in Orange 
County, but these have traditionally been for people whose incomes are near or 
below the poverty level, said Planning Commission Chairwoman Mary Ann Gaido, 
president of the Irvine Community Housing Corp. board of directors. These 
corporations used federal money for their projects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's plan is aimed at young families whose incomes are between the poverty 
level -- $16,000 for a family of four -- and $35,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
"In affluent Orange County, we're trying to get that entry-level worker into 
housing that might otherwise be out of their reach," Gaido said. "This really 
focuses on Irvine, and we're hoping to do units on a larger scale." 
</P>
<P>
A recent study found that most entry-level salaries in the city were between 
$23,000 and $32,000 in a plentiful job market, said City Manager Paul O. Brady 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The sites from which the council will choose three are on a list of 10 provided 
by the Irvine Co., which also has expressed interest in the project. The 
company has not said yet whether any of the land would be donated or offered 
for sale, Gaido said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the three top contenders are a 15-acre parcel near Alton Parkway and 
Harvard Avenue across from City Hall; a 24-acre parcel south of Harvard Park 
near Walnut Avenue, and a one-acre parcel near the intersection of Culver and 
Irvine Center drives. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Ray Watson praised the proposed project and Bridge 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The history of nonprofit housing corporations is that they're all 
well-meaning, but without a good track record to attract (investors), they 
can't get anything done," Watson said. "Bridge has over 3,500 units to its name 
in the (San Francisco) Bay area and they have experienced people." This would 
be the first Southern California project for Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Watson has since last year participated on a study group whose members include 
city officials and community activists. That group recommended forming the 
Irvine Community Housing Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Watson and the activists disagree, however, about whether the project should 
replace the affordable housing quotas imposed on developers. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the quota was set at 25% of the units of every new residential 
project. Of that 25%, 12.5% are to be priced for those earning $25,000 to 
$32,000 per year, 11.5% for those earning $16,000 to $24,000 per year, and 1% 
priced for those earning less than $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, affordable housing quotas have resulted in 3,000 rental units being 
set aside throughout the city. "Affordable housing can be a touchy subject, 
which is why we always have required developers to build affordable units 
first, then build more expensive homes around them," Gaido said. "That will 
continue to be our policy so somebody can't point to a neighborhood or 
apartment building and say that it is where all the low-income people live." 
</P>
<P>
Another affordable housing plan scheduled for discussion tonight is a 
controversial proposal to require developers of commercial property to pay fees 
per square-foot built into a trust fund to be used for housing. That idea was 
from Watson as an alternative to affordable housing quotas.

HINTERGARDT IS GUILTY ON 8 COUNTS; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: HE COULD FACE A PRISON SENTENCE OF 10 TO 12 YEARS FOR HIS PART IN THE 
ATTACK ON AISSA WAYNE AND ROGER LUBY.

Jerrel Lee Hintergardt was found guilty Monday on all eight felony counts in 
the attack on John Wayne's daughter Aissa Wayne and her former boyfriend in 
Newport Beach 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, 38, of Burbank surprised law enforcement officials and even his 
own attorney when he admitted on the witness stand last week that he and 
another gunman approached Wayne and financier Roger W. Luby on Oct. 3, 1988, in 
the garage of Luby's estate and assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
Now prosecutors will concentrate on trying to convict Dr. Thomas Gionis, 
Wayne's ex-husband, in connection with the attack. Gionis is scheduled to go on 
trial next month. Prosecutors claim he ordered the attack on the couple through 
a private investigator who hired Hintergardt and the second gunman, Jeffrey K. 
Bouey. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis denies any involvement in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt admitted slashing Luby's right Achilles tendon with a knife and 
that he handcuffed both victims. But he denied Wayne's claim that her facial 
injuries occurred because he smashed her head into the concrete garage floor. 
Hintergardt blamed Bouey, the other gunman, for those injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey, who is cooperating with authorities, during his testimony last week 
supported Wayne's contention that it was Hintergardt who assaulted Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan set Hintergardt's sentencing for June 8. 
Hintergardt could be sent to prison for a term of 10 to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt's attorney, Todd A. Landgren, told the jury in his opening 
statement last week that he would prove that Hintergardt was at the Veterans 
Hospital in Los Angeles the morning Wayne and Luby were attacked. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday morning, Hintergardt astonished Landgren by telling him just 
before court began that he was responsible for the assault. Landgren, who was 
hired to represent Hintergardt more than a year ago, said it was the first time 
Hintergardt had said anything that even indicated that he was there that day. 
</P>
<P>
Landgren told jurors in his closing argument that he had worked in good faith 
in putting on two days' worth of witnesses to corroborate Hintergardt's alibi. 
</P>
<P>
It took jurors less than a day to return the guilty verdicts. The charges 
included assault, false imprisonment, conspiracy and residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"The verdict comes as no surprise," Landgren said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans would not comment outside the courtroom 
because Gionis' trial is pending. In his closing arguments at the Hintergardt 
trial, however, Evans laid out the heart of his case against the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey had testified that he and Hintergardt and the private investigator, O. 
Daniel Gal, were having a meeting a short time before the assault when Gal got 
a telephone call. Gal told them it was the client, who wanted action fast. 
Telephone records show that Gal received a call from Gionis at that time. 
</P>
<P>
"Who was it on the telephone? Mr. Big. Dr. Gionis," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey and Gal, who has also cooperated with the authorities, have assault 
charges pending against them too. However, their cases are not expected to be 
resolved until after Gionis' trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis was scheduled to go to trial with Hintergardt but won a delay because 
his attorney, John D. Barnett, suffered a serious injury.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
NEW EFFORT DUE ON MARINE LAND SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County is preparing to negotiate an end to a complex, longstanding land 
dispute that has prevented the Marine Corps from building badly needed housing 
in Tustin and the county from completing highway improvements near El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
County officials will sit down by the end of the month with the Irvine Co. to 
try to set a purchase price for 41 acres next to Tustin Marine Corps Air 
Station, said Michael M. Ruane, director of the Orange County Environmental 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution of the land impasse would mean that the county and the city of 
Irvine could proceed with key road projects near El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are the extension of Alton Parkway through the El Toro base to the 
foothill communities, building a Bake Parkway interchange on Interstate 5 and 
the widening of the El Toro "Y" interchange, where Interstate 5 meets the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Alton project, which would be first off the drawing board, would provide an 
alternate route around heavily congested residential neighborhoods in El Toro 
and Lake Forest, Ruane said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. land near the Tustin base is the linchpin in a complicated land deal 
involving the county and the Corps that was originally conceived during the 
administration of President Richard M. Nixon, said Col. Jack Wagner, community 
liaison officer for Marine air bases in Arizona and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The county plans to turn over the newly acquired Irvine Co. property to the 
Corps, which will use it to build housing for some of the 1,400 Marines who are 
on housing waiting lists at both the Tustin and El Toro bases. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the Corps will give the county, for use as parkland, 137 acres at 
Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley, a former military installation. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors formally agreed to buy the Irvine Co. property in 
December, 1987, but the deal stalled while the county grappled with the 
question of how to pay for the land, which has continued to rise in value. One 
appraisal reportedly placed its worth as high as $1 million an acre. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, officials searched for county-owned property to swap with the 
Irvine Co. rather than pay cash, Ruane said. But the land the county wanted the 
firm to accept in trade "really wasn't anything they wanted," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps raised the ante last year, when county officials approached the 
Marines about buying land and a right of way at the El Toro base for the road 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"When they wanted to come to us to talk about Alton," Wagner said, "I simply 
said, 'That sounds reasonable. . . . However, live up to your first agreement. 
Why should we enter a new agreement with you if you haven't fulfilled your 
first agreement?' " 
</P>
<P>
Instead of proposing a land swap with the Irvine Co., the county has decided to 
make a more conventional offer: cash. 
</P>
<P>
The county also plans to buy about 65 acres of Marine Corps land at El Toro for 
the road projects. According to an unclassified Marine document obtained by The 
Times, "the sale would generate a minimum of $17 million" for the Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps would use that money to build housing on the former Irvine Co. land 
near the Tustin base. ROBERT W. STEWART

CITY CHANGES STAND, OKS CAR SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six months after the City Council closed an automobile swap meet at Fullerton 
College, the council has reversed its decision, despite opposition from 
Fullerton car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor A. B. (Buck) Catlin changed his vote; he no longer thinks that the car 
sales will compete unfairly with established used-car dealers in the city or 
that using a public college for a non-educational purpose is inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Catlin had sided with the 3-2 council majority to stop 
Irvine-based CarFaire Inc. from organizing private-party auto sales on the 
college's parking lot. Last week, the council voted 3 to 2 to let CarFaire 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
CarFaire opened at the college in October, charging car owners $15 a day or $25 
a weekend to display their cars for sale. The company leased the parking lot 
space for $500 a weekend, advertised the sales and assisted buyers and sellers 
with ownership transfer forms and other information. 
</P>
<P>
The operation competed unfairly with established automobile dealers who must 
pay overhead and comply with the regulations of several government agencies, 
said James Miller, general manager of McCoy &amp; Mills Ford in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to close CarFaire last year after a city code-enforcement 
officer determined that the business required council approval and a business 
license, which CarFaire had not purchased.TOM McQUEENEY

RESIDENTS CAN'T BELIEVE THEIR EARS 
</P>

<P>
When Denver and Elaine Fults moved into their stucco home nestled just below 
the Saddleback foothills of South County 11 years ago, they could hear the 
trickle of a nearby stream after a good rain. 
</P>
<P>
Now sometimes they can barely hear each other when they stand at opposite 
corners of the bedroom. They have to yell over the rumblings of a major 
six-lane highway -- the section of Trabuco Road that abuts their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against progress," said Fults, a 53-year-old Ford Aerospace engineer. 
"But they've completely destroyed our environment." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the noise from several once-rural roads in the Lake Forest-El Toro 
area is an unhealthful irritant for the families in as many as 750 homes here, 
according to a report expected to be presented today to the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommends further study of the problem with an eye toward building 
a $2.24-million sound wall along portions of Trabuco, El Toro and Jeronimo 
Roads, Bake Parkway, Lake Forest Drive and Toledo Way. Residents would help pay 
for the proposed sound wall through a special property assessment extended over 
10 or 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Developers who have built 25,000 homes in the foothills in the last decade -- 
and who are in the process of building many hundreds more that will use these 
roads -- would also be asked to chip in 25% to 50% of the cost of the sound 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
But residents who say their property values have plummeted are furious at the 
suggestion that they should help pay for the sound wall. They are angry at the 
county planners who came up with the idea and at Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, 
who represents that district on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"They want us to pay for the problem. That's utterly ridiculous. Why should I 
pay for what the county did?" Fults asked. 
</P>
<P>
Fults complains that Vasquez, who took office three years ago, has been slow to 
react to residents' concerns and "has not responded to the environmental issue 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Steven Stack, a neighbor on Shawnee Drive: "That's one of the reasons 
there's such a strong movement down here to become a city, because we don't get 
representation from the supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez bristles at the complaints, noting that it was he who requested the 
report now before the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here just a little over three years," Vasquez said. "I don't know 
what somebody expects in that period of time. It's not an overnight 
proposition." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez also said that when residents first came to him, "it was made very 
clear that the county did not have the financial resources" to pay for 
construction of a sound wall and "it was going to require a joint effort" among 
county, residents and developers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report from the county's Environmental Management Agency, a 
consultant's survey last spring found that noise in the affected neighborhoods 
averaged several notches above the acceptable limit set by the county of 65 
decibels. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has recommended 55 
decibels as an acceptable average. 
</P>
<P>
"You do hear pretty much constant noise," said Richard Adler, an EMA analyst 
who prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
Roanne and Tom Holliman, who moved into their neighborhood about a year ago, 
said that when the trucks are especially noisy, their children sometimes duck 
for cover, thinking it's an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't sleep at all the first night, Roanne Holliman said. When I woke up 
that morning, I cried and said, 'What have we done?' " ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR

An early-morning fire swept through two units of a motel near Disneyland on 
Monday, causing $250,000 damage but no injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials are still investigating the cause of the blaze, which broke out 
shortly after 4 a.m. at the Saga Motel in the 1600 block of South Harbor 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hamric, a division chief for the Anaheim Fire Department, said an occupant 
of one of the razed units called 911 after smelling smoke in his room. 
</P>
<P>
Forty Anaheim firefighters, assisted by a unit from the Orange Fire Department, 
took 14 minutes to control the fire, Hamric said. DAVAN MAHARAJ

Two people have been arrested on suspicion of buying as many as 15 cars using 
other people's financial information, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Marmolejo, 35, of Fontana and Lance Rodney Oldenberg, 51, of Upland 
were arrested last week by Buena Park police. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenberg worked for a company known both as Inland Financial and Fleetwood 
Financial in Upland, which offered to fix bad credit histories for a fee, 
police said. Instead, the two men allegedly used information gathered to buy 
cars without the clients' knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
When payments were not made on a car bought at Campbell Nissan in Buena Park, 
the bank contacted the supposed buyer and got the response, "What car?" Police 
Sgt. Terry Branum said. Eleven other cars similarly purchased, Branum said, 
came from dealers in Buena Park, six from Campbell Nissan. The remaining four 
came from dealers in Hollywood and West Covina. Most were Mercedes-Benzes and 
BMWs, and each cost more than than $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Marmolejo and Oldenberg were both charged with suspicion of conspiracy, grand 
theft and obtaining property based on fictitious credit applications, Branum 
said. Two other people are still wanted in connection with the case, police 
said. Police have not recovered any of the cars.LYNDA NATALI

INFANT 'STABLE' AFTER FALLING INTO POOL

<P>
An infant boy was in stable condition Monday after falling into a swimming pool 
and receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation from his grandfather, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Martinez, 20 months, was riding a tricycle around in the back yard of his 
grandparents' house on the 4800 block of Marion Street when he fell into the 
swimming pool about 6 p.m. Sunday, Police Sgt. Ray Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The grandmother told police the infant had been left unattended for only a few 
minutes when she found him floating face down in the pool. The grandfather 
pulled the unconscious boy from the pool. 
</P>
<P>
The grandparents, whose names were not released, called the 911 emergency 
number and were turned over to an Orange County Fire dispatcher who gave the 
grandfather CPR instructions, said Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they "found that the child had resumed labored breathing," 
Peterson said. Paramedics took the boy to Los Alamitos Medical Center. The 
child was later transported to Long Beach Memorial Hospital where he was listed 
in stable but "favorable" condition, Peterson said.MATT LAIT

TEMPERATURES COOL OFF TO A GREAT DEGREE; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: THE HEAT IS BRINGING AN EARLY START TO THE BRUSH-FIRE SEASON, 
OFFICIALS SAY. WATER USE, HOWEVER, WAS NOT AS GREAT AS EXPECTED.

<P>
Orange County, bedeviled by record-setting temperatures over the weekend, had 
somewhat less trouble keeping its cool Monday with a double-digit drop in highs 
and a return to a more normal weather pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The high in Santa Ana was 79 degrees, 21 degrees below Sunday's 100-degree 
topper. Anaheim, however, remained a toasty 91 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Steve Burback of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, said Anaheim and other inland areas received little relief because 
the marine layer of moist, cool air that doused the heat spell along the coast 
failed to reach those regions. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center, where the thermometer hit a 
record 101 over the weekend, was 79. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected to be even cooler today in the Los Angeles Basin, with the 
marine layer expected to return again along the coast, producing night and 
morning cloudiness and hazy afternoon sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said a pair of high-pressure ridges centered over Central California 
and Utah's Great Basin that produced the weekend's sizzling highs has been 
replaced by cooler air moving southwest into Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
As the weather shifted toward normal, so did the scene at Southland beaches, 
where hundreds of thousands sought relief from the weekend of "superheat," as 
one forecaster called it. 
</P>
<P>
On beaches from Venice and Santa Monica to Topanga Canyon, where an 
extraordinary pre-summer crowd of about 500,000 people collected Sunday, Los 
Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Ira Gruber placed Monday's total at a fraction of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say we have about 10,000 today," Gruber said. 
</P>
<P>
Up the coast, where an estimated 164,000 gathered Sunday on beaches from Zuma 
to Malibu, Senior Lifeguard Jim Jacobson said Monday's crowd was "about normal" 
for a workday while school is in session. He estimated that about 20,000 
sunbathers showed up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where more than 110,000 showed up at Huntington Beach on 
Sunday, Lifeguard Supervisor John Blauer estimated the crowd at about 6,000 on 
Monday. In San Clemente, about 4,000 people lounged on the city's two-mile 
stretch of sand, as opposed to 15,000 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend's hot weather brought the drowning deaths of four teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified Monday as Kydieu Truong, 17, of Monterey Park, who 
was caught in a strong riptide at Hermosa Beach; Juan Martinez and Elias 
Caracoza, both 18 and of North Hollywood, who became entangled in weeds at 
Castaic Lake, and Orlando Gonzalez, 18, a Hollywood High School student, who 
drowned at Santa Fe Dam Park Recreation area in Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Some Southern California water officials were surprised that water use held 
fairly steady and below expected levels over the weekend. A spokesman for the 
Metropolitan Water District, which supplies about 60% of the water in a 
six-county area of Southern California, said its water deliveries peaked Sunday 
at 7,369 acre-feet of water. Officials had suspected that usage would easily 
exceed 8,000 acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas of the Southland water usage did go up over the weekend, but it 
began to head back to normal on Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County water districts reported substantial increases in water use 
during the weekend, but the high demand, water managers said, probably will not 
have an impact on overall supply despite current drought conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Demands have increased substantially and especially during the weekend," said 
Karl Seckel, assistant manager of the Municipal Water District of Orange 
County. "We used up some of our water in storage, but it is insignificant 
compared to the amount used for the year." 
</P>
<P>
Seckel said it is difficult to assess what impact the surge of heat has had on 
the entire water supply of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said the heat spell helped hasten the beginning of the fire season 
in Orange County, drying out hillside vegetation in about three days. Normally, 
browning of the hills would take another month or two, said county Fire Capt. 
Joe Kerr, a wild land fire defense planner.

STATE AMATEUR QUALIFYING EVENT SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The road to Pebble Beach for the 79th California Amateur Championship will go 
through Los Serranos Country Club in Chino -- as it has for the past 20 years 
-- for golfers from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A record 517 low-handicap golfers filed entries for the tournament from the 
southern half of the state, a number that the Southern California Golf Assn. 
had to pare to 400 to accommodate the two Los Serranos courses where qualifying 
will be held May 15-16. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day, half the field will play the 7,110-yard, par-74 South Course, 
and the other 200 will play the 6,200-yard, par-71 North Course. 
</P>
<P>
The fields will be cut to the low 50 and ties for the second round, with the 
players switching courses. After 36 holes, the low 43 will receive invitations 
to play June 25 at Cypress Point in the first round of the State Amateur. 
Actually, there will be 50 from Southern California, but there are seven 
exemptions. Another 50 from Northern California will complete the field. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Stankowski, the Southern California Amateur champion from Oxnard, heads 
the list of players who have exemptions. Others are Dave Stockton Jr. of 
Mentone, runner-up in last year's State Amateur; Mark Johnson of Barstow, the 
SCGA Mid-Amateur champion, and the others who reached the quarterfinals last 
year -- Jack Spradlin Jr. of San Diego, Pat Duncan of Rancho Santa Fe and Craig 
Steinberg of Van Nuys. Another spot will be held open for the NCAA champion, in 
case he is from Southern California, as was Phil Mickelson of La Jolla last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Pastore, the SCGA senior champion from San Diego, also had an exemption but 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
The defending champion is Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove, a caddy at Pebble 
Beach, who defeated Stockton, a USC student and son of former two-time PGA 
champion Dave Stockton, 3 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Players will find a number of minor changes on the North Course at Los 
Serranos, which is owned by former tennis star Jack Kramer. One they won't 
find, however, is that No. 9 has been changed from a 217-yard par-3 to a 
345-yard par-4. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the SCGA ruled Friday that qualifying rounds would be played with 
the old hole, reasoning that the change would confuse players who had practiced 
under the par-3, par-71 format. 
</P>
<P>
The State Amateur will conclude on June 29 with a 36-hole championship final at 
Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The American Golf Club, a 50,000-member organization based in Santa Monica and 
has the largest membership of any golf club in the country, is planning its own 
national scrambles team championship. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying tournaments will be held at the more than 100 courses operated by 
American Golf Corp. Included are Long Beach's five municipal courses, Brookside 
in Pasadena, Camarillo Springs, Fullerton, Oceanside, Rancho San Joaquin in 
Irvine, Vista Valencia and Los Angeles County courses at La Mirada, Los Verdes 
and Mountain Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Once the four-player teams are established, 13 regional tournaments will be 
held around the country. Southern Californians will play at Brookside, 
Oceanside or El Dorado in Long Beach. The finals will be Nov. 17-19 at the 
Painted Desert course in Las Vegas. Two teams will qualify from each regional 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris Tidland, the Valencia High golfer who won the L.A. City junior title, 
plans to enroll at Oklahoma State. . . . Clyde Thompson of Yorba Linda and Bob 
Lowe of Anaheim won the SoCal Left-Handed Golfers Assn. lefty-righty tournament 
at Green River. . . . The Bob Hope USO charity event is set for May 14 at the 
Los Alamitos Naval Air Station course.

</P>

<P>
Rancho Santiago College, the Orange Empire Conference baseball champion, will 
be the second-seeded team in the Southern California playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In pairings and seedings announced Monday, Rancho Santiago (32-9) will play 
host to Mt. San Jacinto (20-21) in the best-of-three first round, which begins 
Friday at 2 p.m. The teams play again on Saturday at 11 a.m., and a third game, 
if necessary, follows. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (25-12), the second-place finisher in the Orange Empire Conference, 
will play host to Cuesta (23-13). Golden West is the eighth-seeded team and 
Cuesta is No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (24-13) will be at the College of the Canyons (24-13) in what is 
expected to be the most evenly-matched series of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matchups: No. 16 MiraCosta (18-18) at No. 1 L.A. Harbor 
(43-5); No. 13 Rio Hondo (20-16) at No. 3 Cerritos (34-5); No. 14 Long Beach 
(16-21) at No. 4 Moorpark (22-12); No. 12 L.A. Mission (24-11) at No. 5 San 
Bernardino Valley (29-13), and No. 11 Riverside (27-15) at No. 6 San Diego City 
(15-19). 
</P>
<P>
Game dates and times are the same for all of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, which finished fourth in the Orange Empire Conference, received the 
biggest break. Its opponent, San Diego City, was declared the Pacific Coast 
Conference champion after the conference's top two teams -- Grossmont and 
Southwestern -- were declared ineligible for the playoffs because they played 
too many regular-season games. The six conference champions automatically 
received the top six seedings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City, which actually finished third in the Pacific Coast race, has 
lost nine of its last 10. 
</P>
<P>
The eight winners of the first round will be split into two four-team regional 
groupings, with second-round sites at Cerritos and Riverside May 18-20. The two 
regional winners from Southern California and the two from Northern California 
will play for the state title May 25-27 at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Softball pairings: The regional softball playoffs, featuring three local teams, 
begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, the Orange Empire Conference champion, plays host to Antelope Valley 
at 3 p.m. Orange Coast plays host to San Diego Mesa at 3 p.m., and Golden West 
plays host to Long Beach at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The winners of the eight first-round games advance to the best-of-three second 
round Saturday and Sunday. The four second-round winners advance to the state 
tournament May 18-20 at Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
All-Conference softball: Kellie Newcombe of Orange Coast was selected player of 
the year and teammate Kristin Heizer and Sally Dugas of Cypress were chosen 
pitchers of the year in a vote by the Orange Empire Conference softball 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Rose Ferrante and infielders Teresa Anderson and Tricia Barr of Cypress 
were selected to the first team. Last season, Ferrante was the conference 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the first team: OCC infielders Wendy Robinson and Cathy Scanlan and 
outfielder Heather Smith; Golden West infielder Gretchen Bock and outfielder 
Dana Ursich; Fullerton infielder Lorraine Garcia and utility player Debbie 
Dunigan, and Saddleback outfielder Kim Greany. 
</P>
<P>
Prediction perfect: For the 13th time in 18 seasons, the Orange County sports 
information directors have correctly picked the winner of the baseball race. 
</P>
<P>
This season's group -- Jack Shinar of OCC, Dale Ruhe of Rancho Santiago, Alan 
Lombardi of Cypress, Robert Schmidt of Riverside, Ken Hill of Fullerton and 
Steve Schwepker of Saddleback -- also correctly picked the top three finishers. 
</P>
<P>
It's the fourth consecutive time the SIDs have tabbed the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Men's volleyball: Matt Lyles, an outside hitter from Orange Coast, was voted 
the South Coast League's most valuable player. Lyles will play at Cal State 
Long Beach in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
OCC teammates Craig Buccola, Travis Turner and Brad Friesen were also named to 
the first team. Lance Lyons of OCC and Dean Cunningham of Golden West were 
second-team selections. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gerad Cawhorn, a freshman infielder from Golden West, had the highest batting 
average -- .404 -- in Orange Empire Conference games. Jeremy Sherman and Conrad 
Colby tied for second at .400. . . . Tony Baca, the Cypress men's soccer coach, 
will take a sabbatical in the fall and be replaced by Fred Leininger, currently 
the coach at Cypress High School. . . . Shawna Armstrong and Micky Hamilton of 
the state champion Golden West women's basketball team will play at Cal State 
San Bernardino in the fall. San Bernardino also got forward Mike Hunter and 
guard John Guerrero of the Rancho Santiago men's basketball team, which won a 
state title.

JANICKI STRAYS FROM FOLD TO BECOME A BRUIN; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: THOUGH HIS SIBLINGS HAVE FULLERTON CONNECTIONS, PETE TURNS 
DOWN TITANS TO PITCH FOR UCLA.

<P>
John Janicki, showing support for a certain UCLA pitcher with the same last 
name, put a Bruin bumper sticker on the rear window of his pickup last fall. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The sticker apparently didn't go over too well in the Janicki household. 
</P>
<P>
After all, John Jr. graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a degree in physics 
and daughter Sue studies accounting at Fullerton. Youngest son Paul is a 
sophomore at El Dorado High in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
But Pete Janicki, the freshman with the fastball, broke sibling tradition and 
strayed to the Westwood campus last fall to play baseball. And dad's bumper 
sticker let everyone know it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sue got a little mad when Dad put the sticker on the truck," Pete Janicki 
said. "She threw a Fullerton one on there right away." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Janicki argued that she "only wanted fair representation" on the window. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete came home from UCLA one weekend and brought Dad the sticker," she said. 
"We had to get him a Fullerton sticker." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Janicki (6-1), a right-hander, turned down a scholarship offer from 
Fullerton last spring to attend UCLA. He also turned down a $50,000 signing 
bonus from the Boston Red Sox, who had drafted him in the ninth round, as well 
as scholarship offers from Pepperdine and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised I got him," UCLA Coach Gary Adams said. "I thought 
he'd go to Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki's five-game winning streak will be on the line tonight against, who 
else?, Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The 21st-ranked Bruins (34-21) play the 17th-ranked Titans (29-20) at 7 p.m. at 
Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
Janicki has mixed emotions about pitching against Fullerton. His former El 
Dorado teammate, Phil Nevin, plays for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil's got Placentia in the palm of his hand," Janicki said. "He's sort of a 
hometown hero there. I wanted to go away to college, but not too far." 
</P>
<P>
Though only a freshman, Janicki is the No. 2 pitcher in the Bruins' rotation. 
Adams planned to use him as a mid-week starter, but with injuries to six of his 
top eight pitchers, Adams had no choice but to use Janicki in pressure 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
"I never like to rush a freshman," Adams said. "With all the experienced 
veterans returning, I let him take his time (at first) and have him pitch 
against teams that aren't much of a grind on him." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki's only defeat was a 7-1 loss at Hawaii Feb. 3, and two victories in his 
streak have been against top-10 powers Arizona State and USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I recruited him more to pitch as a sophomore," Adams said. "I never dreamed he 
would be in the position he's in now." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did Janicki. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a freshman," he said. "I don't have much pull on this team. I just 
hang out. But we've had so many injuries, I've kind of had to be a leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taking it slow, but it seemed like everyone on the staff got hurt. We 
had a bad round of luck. Real hard luck." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki, 6 feet 3 and 205 pounds, has learned all about hard luck and injuries 
in the past year. This season, he was sidelined a month with a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he fought off a case of pneumonia and earned three victories in the 
playoffs as El Dorado won the Southern Section 5-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete's kind of like Orel Hershiser," El Dorado Coach Steve Gullotti said. 
"He's a quiet bulldog. But he was a competitor in high school, especially 
during his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching a tape of the championship game (against Long Beach Millikan) 
the other night and I could see his concentration every time they zoomed in on 
him. He was very focused. Nothing could distract him that night." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a wicked split-finger fastball, Janicki has 35 strikeouts and 13 
walks in 37 1/3 innings this season. He has given up 26 runs (only 15 of them 
earned) and has a 3.62 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not Roger Clemens but he has good movement on the ball and a great 
split-finger (fastball)," Gullotti said. "In the playoffs, he threw that 75% to 
80% of the time. But the biggest thing about him was that he has great control. 
In (82 1/3) innings (his senior year) he had only 15 walks." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki had a 1.75 ERA early this season, but a shoulder injury sidelined him 
for a month in late February and early March. He felt stiffness in his right 
shoulder and though X-rays showed no muscle tear, Janicki spent the next few 
weeks on the training table. 
</P>
<P>
"I could feel (the shoulder) clicking when I threw," Janicki said. "It 
eventually loosened up with the rest. Now, after I warm up, it's really loose." 
</P>
<P>
But as Janicki was leaving the training room, other Bruin pitchers were forming 
a line outside its door. As a result, Adams moved Janicki to the No. 2 spot in 
the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
One of Janicki's biggest tests came against third-ranked Arizona State April 
22. He overcame a shaky start to record a 12-9 victory, breaking the Sun 
Devils' 23-game overall victory streak and 13-game conference streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think much about the streak," Janicki said. "Everyone was talking 
about it. It was my first start in a while and I wanted to keep the score 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki gave up four runs in the first inning, but settled down and was 
supported by some timely hitting from his teammates. He left in the fifth 
inning with a 9-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Slow starts have been my nemesis all year," Janicki said. "I was throwing too 
many fastballs early and I was getting in a groove. I would get it up a little 
bit in the strike zone and they would hit it out of the park. That's been the 
big change for me since high school. There's no way you can get a fastball past 
these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Six days after the Arizona State victory, Janicki was on the mound again, this 
time against eighth-ranked USC. Janicki scattered nine hits and three runs over 
6 2/3 innings, earning an 8-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now he's one of our main cogs in the road to the playoffs," Adams said. 
"He has remarkable poise. Even the common fan can recognize that he pitches 
like a junior or a senior. He handles an error behind him just as well as he 
handles a great play behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki said college has given him time to mature. He said he will play at UCLA 
for at least three seasons, then test the major league draft again before his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Janicki was disappointed with his ninth-round selection last year. He said 
scouts projected him to go in the top five rounds, but his stock dropped after 
he signed with UCLA in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected more out of the draft," he said. "Signing at UCLA probably dropped 
me in the draft, but I had made no plans of going pro after high school." 
</P>
<P>
Gullotti said Janicki caught the scouts' attention during his senior year at El 
Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
"He really came into his own as a senior," Gullotti said. "Up until then he 
hadn't put in the effort in the weight room. He lacked concentration. He would 
be beating a team, doing really well, then start throwing mystery pitches up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki began lifting weights after his junior year. He added 15 pounds and 
some zip to his 87-mile-per-hour fastball. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk Janicki added in the off-season quickly disappeared. He lost 15 
pounds and missed three weeks of the season with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors kept giving me a different diagnosis each week," Janicki said. "It 
was nasty." 
</P>
<P>
Gullotti understood Janicki's situation, assuring him a place in the rotation 
once he returned. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so worn down and sick he didn't care about baseball," Gullotti said. 
"He couldn't eat and he lost all that weight. It was scary. We thought it could 
be worse than a virus. That kind of puts baseball in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki returned midway through the Empire League season. He wasn't sharp in 
his first few appearances. The illness had drained his strength. 
</P>
<P>
"He was hit a little bit after he came back," Gullotti said, "but the last week 
or two he had his strength back and he wasn't tired from pitching. He was 
fresh." 
</P>
<P>
He was fresh enough in the 5-A final against Millikan to pitch a three-hit 
shutout. The 2-0 victory was his third win of the playoffs and improved his 
record to 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a classic," Gullotti said. "Going in, we had beat Lakewood in the 
semifinals Tuesday night and Pete had pitched from the third inning on. I had 
thoughts of starting Jay Hassel for the final game. But Pete asked me on 
Wednesday and said, 'I want to start.' That made it an easy decision for me." 
</P>
<P>
Janicki was 18-3 in three years with El Dorado's varsity. El Dorado was 69-17 
in those three seasons, winning the Empire League championship in 1988 and the 
5-A title last year. 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of success, Adams knew he had to wrestle Janicki away from 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve (Gullotti) made the product back there at El Dorado," Adams said. "And 
I'm just polishing him up a bit."

ARCHIVE CORP. TO TRIM 108 CIPHER JOBS IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Archive Corp., the data storage products maker that merged in April with rival 
Cipher Data Products Inc., said Monday it will lay off 108 employees in San 
Diego and reorganize itself into six new business units. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, which will only affect employees at Cipher's headquarters in San 
Diego, represent a 3% reduction in Archive's 3,300-employee work force. Before 
the merger, Archive had about 1,600 employees and Cipher had 1,700. 
</P>
<P>
Archive, based in Costa Mesa, said the job cuts are the result of a reduced 
demand for Cipher's products, a need to eliminate duplication after the two 
firms' corporate staffs were merged and a transfer of some manufacturing to 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-month hostile takeover battle, Cipher Data finally agreed in 
April to be acquired by Archive for $123 million. Several top Cipher 
executives, including Chairman Gary Liebl, resigned from the company in late 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Under the realignment, manufacturing will be consolidated at two plants in 
Singapore and corporate finance and administration will be combined in Costa 
Mesa. Employees in Costa Mesa will not be affected by the layoffs, said B.J. 
Rone, chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the new Archive, the final plan for our merged company," Rone said. 
"We haven't made any decisions about one division, (Cipher's Optimem), but this 
is the only reorganization and only layoffs we expect." 
</P>
<P>
Allen Strand, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles, 
said the layoff was expected and that further consolidations may follow. 
</P>
<P>
Archive and Cipher both make tape drives that serve as backup storage systems 
to prevent the loss of data stored in computer hard disk drives in the event of 
system crashes or natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
The merged company will realign itself into six units distinguished by separate 
technologies and markets. The changes in the company operations are as follows: 
</P>
<P>
* Archive's original equipment manufacturing products division will make 5 
1/4-inch tape drives under both the Archive and Cipher brands. Cipher's San 
Diego unit will shift its manufacturing overseas and some employees will be 
transferred to Archive's plant in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
* Cipher in San Diego will focus exclusively on its original core business of 
making half-inch tape drives for minicomputers. Craig Turner, a longtime Cipher 
employee, will serve as the division's president. 
</P>
<P>
* Cipher's Irwin Magnetic Systems, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., will concentrate 
on the design and marketing of quarter-inch mini-cartridges and 3 1/2-inch form 
factor tape drives and tape backup subsystems. Ed Carlson will be president of 
Irwin. Herb Amster, a founder of Irwin, will move to the Archive corporate 
staff as senior vice president of corporate development. 
</P>
<P>
* The tape drive manufacturing operations of both Archive and Cipher will be 
consolidated in Singapore under the supervision of Jess Parker, senior vice 
president of operations for Archive.

$44-MILLION LEASE SIGNED FOR NEWPORT OFFICE SPACE; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: CANADIAN DEVELOPER BRAMALEA CALIFORNIA GRANTED HUGE CONCESSIONS, 
HOWEVER, TO GET HEWITT ASSOCIATES INTO THE OFFICE BUILDING THAT WILL OVERLOOK 
UPPER NEWPORT BAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian developer Bramalea California said Monday it had signed management 
consulting firm Hewitt Associates to a $44-million lease in an office building 
Bramalea plans to build overlooking the Upper Newport Bay here. 
</P>
<P>
The lease is the latest in a series of big deals signed over the last several 
years by Orange County landlords. It covers as much as 130,000 square feet, or 
nearly three floors of the six-story building, and runs 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
That makes the deal, which had long been rumored, one of half a dozen of the 
largest office leases ever signed in the county. Construction starts next 
month, and the building is scheduled to open in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
During the months-long negotiations, Hewitt drove a hard bargain: It obtained 
about a 30% ownership in the new building, depending on how much space it 
ultimately leases. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt also got Bramalea to assume its old lease at Santa Ana's Hutton Centre 
office park. Bramalea must now make Hewitt's rent payments for three years 
unless it can find another tenant for the 70,000 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a soft office market in which tenants can make these sorts of demands 
of landlords, Bramalea officials said they believe that they can lease the 
Hutton Centre space quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"With the options on the lease, it runs for a fairly long time, and the 
location is good," said Samuel E. Haynes, Bramalea's executive vice president. 
"We think we can get somebody in there pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
That may be so, said a local real estate broker, "but at what price? They'll 
probably have to charge less than the lease rate to get someone in." 
</P>
<P>
The deal, however, allows Bramalea to complete its 64-acre Bayview office and 
residential development, which already includes a Marriott Suite hotel, Downey 
Savings &amp; Loan's headquarters in a structure identical to the new building, 
restaurants, stores and two gated residential neighborhoods. With Hewitt signed 
up, the new building is about 70% pre-leased, Bramalea said. 
</P>
<P>
Bayview is the company's largest project in Orange County. With its much bigger 
Corporate Pointe office project in West Los Angeles still under development, 
Bramalea said it doesn't contemplate another big project in Orange County soon. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt said it picked the Bayview building because the company likes to own at 
least a piece of the structures it occupies. The firm had owned a piece of the 
Hutton Centre 3 building until it was sold to a Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
It also liked the ambience of the Upper Newport Bay setting, said Hewitt; the 
buildings look out over the bay and the marshes. "We liked all the open space 
and the fact that a lot of it will never be developed," said Jim Ozark, 
Hewitt's managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt is one of the world's largest consulting firms specializing in employee 
benefits and compensation. It is based in Lincolnshire, Ill., near Chicago. The 
Bayview building will house its Southern California headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The building will have an exterior of imported granite and tinted glass. A 
large marble-and-granite lobby will have a waterfall enclosed in a three-story 
canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Bramalea California is a unit of Bramalea Ltd., a publicly held Toronto 
developer that owns or manages more than 32 million square feet of offices, 
hotels and malls. 
</P>
<P>
Bramalea said recently that it earned $64.8 million for the fiscal year ending 
Oct. 31, 1989, on revenues of $1.1 billion. Earnings rose 37% from 1988's $47.4 
million on revenues of $797 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to commercial development, the company also builds homes in 
Southern California.

HOME PRICE RISES ONLY 3.9%; SALES DROP 20% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reflecting what real estate specialists say is a return to a normal market 
after two years of buyer frenzy, the price of resale homes in Orange County 
inched up a mere 3.9% in the first quarter from the same period in 1989, while 
total sales fell 20%, a state realty trade group reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a resale single-family home in the county for the first 
quarter was $243,599, up from $240,624 in the last quarter of 1989. It was 
$234,381 in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in price appreciation dropped Orange County into fifth place among 
the state's most expensive resale markets. Just two years ago, Orange County 
led the nation in housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
Topping Orange County in the first quarter were Santa Clara County, with a 
$273,673 median; the San Francisco Bay Area, at $262,182; Monterey County, at 
$244,191, and Ventura County, at $243,218. 
</P>
<P>
But though Orange County's first-quarter sales fell from a year earlier, they 
rebounded from a weak fourth quarter, posting a 5.4% increase in volume and a 
1.2% increase in price for the initial three months, the California Assn. of 
Realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
And that made Orange County the only one of the state's major housing regions 
to post a sales increase from the fourth quarter, the group reported. 
</P>
<P>
The association's numbers do not include condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, 530,105 resale single-family homes closed escrow during the first 
quarter -- up 2.9% from 515,354 homes sold in the fourth quarter of 1989 but 
down 13.3% from a year earlier, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide figures are seasonally adjusted, while figures for the individual 
counties are not. 
</P>
<P>
Resale activity on an annual basis was up in the Central Valley and San Diego 
and down in the more expensive Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco and 
Ventura areas, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite lower interest rates than a year ago, sales in the coastal 
metropolitan centers have been stalled by high home prices and a large 
inventory buildup," said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and 
economics for the association. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in price hikes -- resale home appreciation rates were in the 
double digits this time last year -- should help attract buyers in the 
metropolitan areas during the second quarter, she said, "but activity will be 
tempered by rising interest rates. Overall, we are projecting an 11% sales 
decline this year, compared with all of 1989." 
</P>

PACIFIC SYMPHONY PLANS TO ACCEPT FUNDING FROM NEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While some artists and arts groups across the country are rejecting or 
threatening to reject grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, 
objecting to Congressional attempts to control artistic content, Orange 
County's Pacific Symphony plans to accept pending endowment funding of $45,000 
for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the objections have focused on a form, mandated by Congress, that grant 
recipients must sign this year. The form states that they will not use grant 
money to produce obscene artworks that do not meet standards of artistic 
excellence, which are not defined. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Symphony executive director Louis G. Spisto said Monday, "Our art form 
is not under fire. Pacific Symphony will sign our grant form." 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said the pending NEA grant would underwrite conductors' fees, not the 
creation of music, therefore eliminating the possibility that the orchestra 
would be producing "obscene" artworks with the money. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the orchestra had considered rejecting the grant anyway, to show 
solidarity with other artists whose work is "under fire," Spisto said: "We need 
the (NEA) support. Our organization is not at the state in its development 
where it can afford to turn down a $45,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking personally, I feel the NEA should be funded without obscenity-tied 
language. But it is more important that the NEA continue. That is the major 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Philharmonic Society also has received preliminary notice of 
an NEA grant but has made no decision whether to accept it, according to 
executive director Erich Vollmer. The $3,500 grant would support a series of 
American artists at the new Irvine Theatre, expected to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The society's trustees will discuss the matter this weekend, Vollmer said. 
</P>
<P>
At South Coast Repertory, a longtime NEA recipient in Costa Mesa, artistic 
director Martin Benson said: "We will have to consider (the question of 
accepting future NEA funding) very carefully. But I think we need to accept NEA 
funds, while fighting to have the strictures removed in the granting process." 
</P>
<P>
SCR has received $1 million from the NEA since 1980, more than any other Orange 
County arts organization. About $650,000 went to operating funds, $350,000 to 
capital funds. Last year, the theater received $95,000 from the NEA; this year, 
it applied for $180,000. The NEA's response to the current grant request is 
expected in June or July. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point," said Benson, "we are choosing plays exactly as we have for 26 
years, and we will continue to do so. If the strictures reached a point where 
it affected our artistic choices, we would disassociate ourselves from the NEA 
or any contributors -- public or private -- who would restrict our freedom to 
choose." 
</P>
<P>
At the Newport Harbor Art Museum, spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber said, "We haven't 
dealt with (the NEA issue) yet because we don't hear till the middle of June" 
whether the museum will receive three grants, totaling $156,000, for which it 
has applied, primarily for exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen any document with that language (barring support of allegedly 
obscene art) yet, and we haven't come up with a policy to address it," Gaiber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A decision has been made by the museum trustees to include a statement about 
the NEA issue in the July/August calendar it will send to members, but the 
statement itself has not been determined, Gaiber said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor received $111,000 from the NEA in 1989.

Kari Geller, a 17-year-old writer from San Clemente, will have her play "The 
Waiting" produced at the Kennedy Center in Washington on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
The play was selected by the Young Playwrights Program of Very Special Arts, an 
organization based at the Kennedy Center that provides arts experiences for 
disabled young people. "The Waiting," which is semi-autobiographical, tells the 
story of a young girl who comes down with encephalitis and whose mother has 
been disabled by polio. It was developed in workshops at the Laguna Playhouse 
Youth Theatre, where Geller is a member of the ensemble. The Youth Theatre also 
has performed another Geller play, "The Children of Belfast."

SILLY GAGS OF 'NERD' OFTEN DRAW A LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As a study in silliness, Larry Shue's "The Nerd" makes you laugh in spite of 
yourself -- which is not necessarily a bad thing. The play is out-and-out 
ludicrous, and the gags have the sort of unalloyed dumbness found on "I Love 
Lucy." This, too, is not a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
But what did Orange County playgoers do to deserve two productions of "The 
Nerd" within the span of just a few weeks? First there was the one that closed 
Sunday at the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse. Now there is the one that opened here 
over the weekend at the Laguna Playhouse's Moulton Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that the audience didn't do anything. Nor is it likely that it 
will have seen both productions since there is scant overlap among subscribers 
to these two amateur companies. Therefore, consecutive appearances of "The 
Nerd" must be a form of revenge against the theater reviewers. The producers 
apparently had a secret meeting in the Adirondacks and decided to send us a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: One of the play's chief characters is a drama critic neatly skewered 
for his alcoholism and his cynical penchant for writing reviews even before 
getting to the theater. Shue understood how to plant the kiss of death on this 
curmudgeon's lips, while also providing him with a lion's share of the play's 
snappiest lines. 
</P>
<P>
Such an egocentric view is subject to doubt, of course. Drama critics are by 
nature hard to believe. Some prefer a combination of narcotics and amphetamines 
to booze -- speedballs, we call it in the trade -- and far from preconceiving 
their reviews, they often wander out of the theater more mystified by the 
home-grown productions they've just seen than before they went in. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I can't help feeling that "The Nerd" has particular significance for 
Orange County. Two revivals of this 1985 screwball farce in such a short 
period, far from being mere coincidence, must mean the producers have 
discovered a local subtext. Could it be that Shue really had the county in mind 
when he wrote "The Nerd," despite its Terre Haute, Ind., setting? 
</P>
<P>
The play revolves around the threesome of Axel (the critic) and his two best 
friends: Willum, an idealistic architect who is designing a hotel but who would 
rather be doing a museum, and Tansy, a budding career woman who is about to 
leave for Washington to become a TV weather girl. It's hard to believe a trio 
like that could possibly exist in the whole state of Indiana, let alone Terre 
Haute (Jane Pauley notwithstanding). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those characters, we meet a rapaciously materialistic 
businessman unaccountably nicknamed Ticky (it does make for snatches of 
Abbott-and-Costello dialogue); his schoolmarm wife, Clelia, who teaches s-l-o-w 
learners and therefore speaks s-l-o-w-l-y; and their unbearable son, Thor. 
</P>
<P>
Last -- but hardly least -- comes the nerd, a dim-witted Vietnam veteran who 
once saved Willum's life during the Vietnam War. He arrives unexpectedly during 
a party for Willum's 34th birthday and proceeds to throw all their lives into 
such chaos that it could happen only in a farce. 
</P>
<P>
If you instinctively like plays in which people wander around with paper bags 
over their heads, and in which props such as toilet paper, broken dishes, 
macaroni and cottage cheese loom large, you'll love "The Nerd." 
</P>
<P>
If buffoonery holds no interest for you and you happen to be caught at the 
Moulton by accident, you may make a polite dash for the exit early in the first 
act when Willum's telephone answering machine speaks volumes and the players 
consequently have little to do but stand around and listen. Those moments are 
so lengthy and inert as to be sure show stoppers in the most literal sense. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is ably guided, nonetheless, by Playhouse artistic director Douglas 
Rowe, who has milked the gags without completely abandoning reality to 
slapstick. He didn't have to choose the play in the first place, but as long as 
he has, he can't be expected to rewrite Shue's work or edit out its vaster 
reaches of empty space. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bielitz plays the thankless role of the nerd with tireless energy and 
an abundance of humor. Michael Miller gives the most effective performance of 
the evening as Ticky, with some lovely slow burns of put-upon indignation. 
</P>
<P>
Both John Bavaro as Willum and Catherine Rowe as Tansy could be more colorful, 
though just how is hard to say since both roles are written blandly to begin 
with. Paul Klees turns in a mildly urbane performance as Axel that could use 
more acid. Jennifer Myers Johnson has her moments as Clelia. And Nicholas Cagle 
is appropriately annoying as Thor. 
</P>

1 MILLION PETITION TO VOTE ON GILL-NET BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of a proposed ban on gill-net fishing submitted 1 million petition 
signatures that should be more than enough to qualify the measure for the 
November, 1990, ballot. "This is a great day for the marine resources of 
California," said Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Westminster), head of the 
initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the people . . . will have the opportunity to decide the future fate of 
our marine resources." Allen pursued the initiative route after the 
Legislature, under heavy pressure from the commercial industry, rejected 
several attempts to enact a gill-net restriction in Southern California. 
Initiative proponents said 72% of all marine species caught in such nets -- 
including whales, dolphins and sea lions -- have no economic value to 
commercial fishermen. The initiative would outlaw the use of gill and trammel 
nets in a zone extending three miles off the coast from Point Arguello to the 
Mexican border.

REQUEST FOR SIGNAL AT SCHOOL IS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One death and one seriously injured student do not warrant the cost of 
installing a traffic signal in front of Nordhoff High School on California 33, 
Caltrans has told Ojai officials. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joseph DeVito said the City Council will discuss tonight whether to 
appeal the California Department of Transportation decision or find other ways 
to finance the $18,000 project. 
</P>
<P>
A Caltrans study of pedestrian traffic showed that only 35 cross the highway in 
a two-hour period, five fewer than required to justify a signal, said Peter 
Hsu, a Caltrans traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials said Caltrans only counted people using one of the 
three crosswalks in front of the school. 
</P>
<P>
About 175 residents have signed petitions calling for a signal at the school. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and County Supervisor Maggie Erickson 
joined the city in asking the state to put in a warning signal after a 
16-year-old Ojai girl was seriously injured when a car hit her while she 
crossed the highway in October. Another teen-ager died in 1986 after being hit 
by a car in front of the school. THIA BELL

BED AND BREAKFAST DENIED BY COUNCIL

<TEXT>
<P>
After two hours of debate, the Santa Paula City Council on Monday night denied 
a homeowner's request to operate a bed and breakfast inn. 
</P>
<P>
The council vote reversed an earlier Planning Commission decision to allow 
Gilbert and Cheryl Eigenhuis to operate a bed and breakfast inn out of their

outskirts of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, who earlier presented the Planning Commission with a 65-signature 
petition, again objected and presented an additional 71 signatures. They said 
it would bring in crowds and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a residential area and they do need to consider the people in the 
area," Vera Laan said. "We want to keep it a strictly family residential area." 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the proposed bed and breakfast accused these residents of using scare 
tactics to collect signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to deny the proposal, saying that although the 
eight-guest house would not have a serious impact on the area, too many 
residents objected to let it go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is that much objection, I just don't think it is proper," said Carl 
Barringer, a City Council member. He and other members raised concerns that the 
proposed inn might violate city zoning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula has no bed and breakfast inns. The Lemon Tree Inn closed more than 
two years ago. KEN McALPINE

Bolivia's ailing economy.

Winding up three hours of talks at the White House, Bush promised that he would

A 41-year-old lawyer from a prominent political family took over as president 
today in the long shadow of Oscar Arias Sanchez, who thrust this country into 
the global spotlight with his regional peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Incoming President Rafael Calderon Fournier acknowledged his predecessor's 
international renown but said he will concentrate on internal affairs -- 
without giving short shrift to foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Arias spearheaded Central American peace efforts that promoted democracy and 
sought an end to civil wars. He won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting a 
regional peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
Although originally thrilled with Arias' fame, many Costa Ricans have now come 
to feel that he gained it at their expense -- by ignoring domestic problems. 
Even so, he leaves office with an approval rating of 90%.

Denis Thatcher arrived back at 10 Downing Street today from a visit to the 
United States and failed to notice his wife waiting in the front hall.

<P>
"Hello, how are you," cried Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her husband, 
who turns 75 Thursday, headed for their private apartment on the top floor of 
10 Downing Street. 
</P>
<P>
Stopped in his tracks, Denis turned, gave her a quick kiss and strode off.

His wife, waiting to meet Vice President Dan Quayle, called after him: "I am 
waiting for the vice president. Would you like to meet him?"

"I need a shave," Denis called over his shoulder as he disappeared upstairs.

A smiling prime minister told reporters and photographers: "He's just back from

Mixing anger with grief, World Jewish Congress leaders today honored the memory 
of the 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust at the mansion where 
high-ranking Nazis plotted their "Final Solution." 
</P>
<P>
"I will not pray here, because I personally believe that God turned his face 
away from this place, as he did from Auschwitz," said congress President Edgar 
M. Bronfman. 
</P>
<P>
"Neverthless something must be said." 
</P>
<P>
In Hebrew, German and English, participants read words penned by death camp 
survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel: 
</P>
<P>
"What does a Jew today feel in this place, marked by evil and malediction? Fear 
and trembling, anger -- incommensurate anger, helplessness and grief, infinite 
grief." 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony at the Wannsee Villa came on the final day of the World Jewish 
Congress meeting in Berlin, the first time the organization has met on German 
soil. Some delegates from around the world stayed away from the meeting, saying 
the trip to the heart of Nazi tyranny would be too traumatic.

EX-HOSTAGE SAYS ANDERSON IS OK

Terry Anderson, the longest held of the 16 Western hostages, helped fellow 
prisoners make Scrabble and Monopoly games to amuse themselves, according to a 
newly freed captive. 
</P>
<P>
His guards are giving him and other hostages plenty of diversions, according to 
an account given by former hostage Frank H. Reed to Anderson's sister, Peggy 
Say. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of things which was encouraging to me; at least they did at 
the time Frank was there," Say said. These included boxes of books, writing 
materials and dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated 
Press, is in good physical condition from plenty of exercise, he is tired and 
needs dental care, Say said. She said the hostages are blindfolded and chained 
in line with their preference. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank preferred a chain on his wrist," she said. "Terry preferred a chain on 
his ankle so that his arms are free to write and play cards." 
</P>
<P>
The closest she and Reed were able to calculate that he last saw Anderson was 
somewhere between a year and 18 months ago. Reed spent 20 months with Anderson 
and Thomas Sutherland in Lebanon. For a period of time, the three American 
hostages were with two others, John McCarthy and Brian Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, the director of the private Lebanon International School, was freed April 
30 after being held for 44 months. He met with Say on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is in his sixth year of captivity. Sutherland was a dean at the 
American University of Beirut. McCarthy is a British television journalist. 
Keenan taught English at American University. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said Anderson could pick up some things in Arabic from the radio and have 
at least some idea of what he thought was going on in the world. But his guards 
have made a concerted effort to keep from him news of the deaths of his father 
and brother, both from cancer, within four months of each other in 1986. Say 
said she believes he still does not know. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very difficult," she said. "Part of you wants him to have known and 
dealt with it and part of you believes it might be too much for him if he found 
out in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
But with his mind still sharp, he thinks of new birthdays painfully 
uncelebrated for the two daughters he cares for so deeply. 
</P>
<P>
He is wracked with anguish at missing more than five years with them, unable to 
savor the passage of Gabrielle from child to woman. In Anderson's sixth year of 
captivity, Gabrielle turned 14 on April 26. 
</P>
<P>
He has never held Sulome, who was born three months after he was kidnaped. She 
will be 5 on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Reed, who said he was brutally beaten by his kidnapers for trying to 
escape twice, Anderson was left alone. Say said Reed told her Anderson was not 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Reed told Say that her brother was aware of her tireless campaign to free him 
and the other hostages.

Former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore today fulfilled an agreement with federal 
prosecutors by pleading guilty to a five-count corruption indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The maverick Republican, the only West Virginia governor to serve three 
four-year terms, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman, 
brought in from Baltimore because federal judges in the state asked to be 
excused. 
</P>
<P>
Moore faces up to 36 years in prison and fines totaling $1.2 million. 
Sentencing was set for July 10. U.S. Atty. Michael Carey said the government 
agreed to make no sentencing recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 67, agreed April 12 to plead guilty to extortion, mail fraud, tax fraud 
and obstruction of justice after federal prosecutors revealed they had secretly 
recorded a meeting in which Moore allegedly admitted receiving illegal cash 
donations in his 1988 campaign. The recording also allegedly showed he planned 
to hide information from federal investigators.

Britain's Prince Charles today praised East Europeans for casting off communism 
but warned that the region faces an "ecological Armageddon." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the shadow of a statue of Karl Marx at a Budapest university that 
until recently bore the name of the father of communism, Charles was strident 
in his condemnation of Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
"In the name of Karl Marx, Lenin and Stalin charted a course that divided 
Russia from Europe and then, after the Second World War, forcibly removed 
Hungary from Western Europe, turning half of Europe into a form of Marxist 
prison camp," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans can now "reshape the moral and political future of our continent," 
Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the future is in danger from the grave ecological damage 
wrought by developed industry in the West and centralized planning in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"Central Europe has itself been the victim of ideological experiment and the 
worst follies of a command economy," said Charles.

MASTERCARD AND VISA WILL HALT DEBIT CARD BID

Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Mastercard International have agreed to terminate a 
national debit card venture to settle charges they conspired to dominate the 
market, a group of state attorneys general announced today. 
</P>
<P>
An antitrust suit by 14 states claimed that because Visa and Mastercard members 
include virtually every major U.S. bank, their joint development of the 
so-called Entree debit card network constituted an attempt to create a monopoly 
in the emerging "point-of-sale" debit card industry. 
</P>
<P>
A debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card, but the money is 
automatically deducted from the cardholder's account and transferred to the 
merchant. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed June 26 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleged that Visa 
and Mastercard tried to undermine the debit card competition by gaining control 
of the nation's two largest automatic teller machine networks. 
</P>
<P>
The two networks, Cirrus System Inc. of Downers Grove., Ill., and Plus System 
Inc. of Denver, had been formulating their own plans for national debit card 
networks in the early and mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Visa also took over the Interlink Network, based in San Mateo, Calif., the 
nation's largest regional debit card network. 
</P>
<P>
Visa and Mastercard began developing Entree in 1986, but the venture has not 
yet begun operation. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Abrams, New York state attorney general, said in a news release that the 
two companies had been engaged in a "creeping merger" that had already resulted 
in largely uniform pricing in the credit card industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The two corporations have virtually the same members and rate structures," he 
said. "With Entree, Visa and Mastercard would have taken the crucial step of 
jointly marketing a debit card, which most observers expect to be a dominant 
form of payment in the 'cashless' society of the future. This had to be 
stopped. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The states that filed suit were Arizona, California, Connecticut, Louisiana, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, 
Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement signed today by U.S. District Judge Pierre N. 
Laval in Manhattan, Visa and Mastercard will abandon Entree and notify bank 
participants that it will be terminated by Oct. 1.

IMF PANEL OKS 50% MORE FOR LOANS TO EUROPE, 3RD WORLD

<P>
A 50% increase in money available for loans to Eastern Europe and developing 
countries was approved today by the International Monetary Fund's policy-making 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
At the insistence of the United States, the IMF's Interim Committee 
</P>
<P>
linked the $60-billion increase to a plan to force substantial economic reforms 
from 11 poor countries, which are $4 billion behind on their loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Congress had demanded the link before approving the 
increase in the U.S. contribution, or quota. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the link, which many debtor countries opposed, the United 
States agreed to begin consideration of an additional increase in its 
contribution in 1993, two years earlier than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite reservations that a number of members had on certain individual 
elements of the package, we recognize this was a consensus. . . . Everybody had 
to give in order to achieve a compromise," said Canadian Finance Minister 
Michael H. Wilson, chairman of the 22-member Interim Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The quota change, which must be approved before the end of 1991 by nations 
representing 85% of the fund's voting power, will raise the fund's resources to 
$180 billion from $120 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see . . . is a package with features that are designed to strengthen 
the role of the International Monetary Fund as the central pillar of the 
international financial system," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Delinquent countries that agree to adopt economic reforms would be eligible for 
money from a special IMF fund. However, nations in arrears could lose their 
voting rights. Also, the agency could sell 3 million ounces of gold, roughly 
equivalent to the members' original contributions, to meet the obligations of 
defaulting debtors. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 nations in arrears are the Sudan, Zambia, Peru, Costa Rica, Honduras, 
Guyana, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Vietnam and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Interim Committee also agreed to reorder the voting power within the fund, 
allowing Japan to vault from fifth place to second, behind the United States, 
in recognition of its growing financial power. West Germany will share the 
second position. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Britain, which had been No. 2, and France were close to an 
agreement to share the fourth spot, although that was not addressed in the 
Interim Committee's statement. 
</P>
<P>
The panel reached agreement on the package Monday night after debating it most 
of the day in private sessions. It announced the pact in a communique this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The plan had received an important boost Sunday with the endorsement by the 
Group of Seven major industrial nations: the United States, Japan, West 
Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, the Interim Committee promised to support reforms in Eastern 
European countries emerging from four decades of communism but not at the 
expense of developing countries. It welcomed applications for fund membership 
from Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Romania are 
already members. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also pointed to progress under Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's 
14-month-old program to reduce the crushing $1.3-trillion debt burden on Third 
World countries.

OPEC states to support prices, which have fallen by up to 25% this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount that Nigeria was supposed to be making in excess of its quota was 
140,000 barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
This is the amount by which we intend to cut down," said Oil Minister Jubril 
Aminu. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided at 
an emergency meeting in Geneva last week to cut output by 1.445 million barrels 
a day to try to mop up an oil surplus seen as responsible for the sharp fall in 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's output was estimated at 1.75 million barrels a day in April against 
an allocated quota of 1.611 million. 
</P>
<P>
With total group output 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day above its 22 
million barrel-a-day ceiling, set last November, prices for the actively traded 
Brent oil crashed below $16 a barrel last month from as high as $20 in January. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC's target price for a basket of its crudes is $18.

State-owned El Al Israel Airlines today reported profit of $24.2 million for 
1989, its fourth consecutive year in the black. 
</P>
<P>
The profit marked a 28.7% jump from El Al's 1988 earnings of $18.8 million. 
Revenues rose 7.2% to $713.6 million from $665.3 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
El Al said it carried 1.74 million passengers last year, 12% more than in 1988, 
when tourism to Israel fell sharply in the early months of a Palestinian 
uprising in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The sustained profitability is likely to enhance prospects of floating El Al 
shares on the Tel Aviv and foreign stock exchanges, proposed as part of 
Israel's privatization drive.

DUSTED-OFF 'LUCY' PILOT, 'ROSEANNE' TIE

<P>
Americans still love Lucy and they proved it last week by putting the 
previously unaired pilot for "I Love Lucy" in a tie with "Roseanne" as the 
most-watched show of the week, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to share of audience, "Lucy" topped "Roseanne," 37% to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of "Lucy" and the theatrical movie version of another old 
favorite, "The Untouchables" -- No. 9 in the Nielsens -- helped push CBS to 
within a 10th of a rating point of frontrunner NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new shows that have been introduced this spring, NBC still has the 
top two -- "Wings" in 14th place and "Carol &amp; Company" in 16th. Both shows 
are in protected spots -- "Wings" follows "Cheers," the week's No. 3 show, and 
"Carol" this week followed on hour-long "Golden Girls" (13th). 
</P>
<P>
The special preview of "Brewster Place" on ABC came in tied for 17th, well down 
from its "Roseanne" lead-in. This week it moves into its regular time period, 
Wednesdays following "Doogie Howser, M.D." 
</P>
<P>
ABC is still looking for the show that will capitalize on the lead-in from 
"America's Funniest Home Videos." Last week's "Anything For Laughs" came in 
20th, down significantly from fourth place "Videos." 
</P>
<P>
"Down Home" (NBC) also was unable to hold onto the audience of its lead-in, 
"Carol," tying for 44th place. 
</P>
<P>
The show it tied with is ABC's "Twin Peaks," 44th last week, 45th the previous 
week, 28th the week before and in fifth place when it premiered as a Sunday 
movie on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
The other spring entries include "Equal Justice" (ABC), 49th; "Shannon's Deal" 
(NBC), 50th; "Bagdad Cafe" (CBS), tied for 51st; "Marshall Chronicles" (ABC), 
tied for 58th; "Family For Joe" (NBC) 61st; "Sugar &amp; Spice" (CBS), tied for 
62nd; "Small Talk" (CBS), tied for 72nd; "In Living Color" (Fox), 76th; 
"Sydney" (CBS), 79th, and "Capital News" (ABC), tied for 86th. 
</P>
<P>
ABC brought "Elvis" back and it landed in 82nd place. 
</P>
<P>
CBS was the big winner among the Sunday movies with "The Untouchables" in ninth 
place. ABC's "Burning Bridges" came in 29th and NBC's "Archie: To Riverdale and 
Back" tied for 51st. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was the most-watched network on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, while CBS 
took Monday and Sunday and ABC had Tuesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the week ending May 6 with a 12.1 rating and a 21 share. CBS came in a 
very close second with a 12.0 rating and a 21 share, while ABC had an 11.3 
rating and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
The official 30-week prime time season ended Sunday, April 15, but working on a 
52-week season, as of the week ending May 6 NBC had a year-to-date rating of 
14.4 and a 24 share. ABC was second with a 12.8 rating and a 21 share and CBS 
third, with a 12.0 and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening news race, ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings 
continued to dominate with a 9.5 rating and a 20 share. "CBS Evening News" with 
Dan Rather stayed in second place with an 8.5 rating and an 18 share, while 
"NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw was third with an 8.3 rating and an 18 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Each ratings point represents about 921,000 households and a share is the 
percentage of TV sets tuned to a particular show.

LIVING COLOUR BAND SUES FOX 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Grammy-winning hard rock group Living Colour has sued Fox Broadcasting Co., 
claiming that the network's new "In Living Color" show stole the band's name 
and logo. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed Friday in New York, seeks an injunction against Fox and 
producers of the Saturday night comedy as well as unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
"In Living Color" producer Tamara Rawitt declined to comment, as did Brad 
Turell, senior vice president of Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"In Living Color" has received rave reviews and was 29th in the ratings during 
its April 15 debut. 
</P>
<P>
Created by Keenen Ivory Wayans, who did the black satirical films "Hollywood 
Shuffle" and "I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka," "In Living Color" is a black version 
of "Saturday Night Live" that pokes fun at racial stereotypes with an almost 
all-black crew of comedians.

LIZ SMITH: HEPBURN STELLAR ATTRACTION AMONG '100 STARS'

FRANK SINATRA won't sign on board again for another stint with Bally when his 
casino contract ends and the big question now is -- whither goest His Frankness 
after that? (He can just about take his pick.) 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD GERE was the big name missing from "The Night of 100 Stars" after 
accepting, even though his name was taped right on the steps where the rest of 
us took our bows in the finale. (Some of us were only "stars" for the moment, 
courtesy of producer Alex Cohen.) 'Tis said that Gere wanted the opportunity to 
make political comments in his speech. Cohen felt this was a night of fighting 
AIDS for the Actors' Fund; it was not for politicking or ideology. 
</P>
<P>
You can see this big blast on NBC come May 21, and I'm sure it will be shorter, 
crisper, better than ever, and they'll identify everybody, which should add to 
the fun. You'll be able to see Pia Zadora's tonsils when she sings and you can 
perhaps answer the question that flew through Radio City Music Hall the night 
of the taping: How much did hubby Meshulam Riklis donate to the Actor's Fund? 
</P>
<P>
The great moment of the night was the magical appearance of Katharine Hepburn, 
and they probably should have ended the show on that. But there are swell 
moments after as well, so if you can endure rap singers and bad comics and 
stuff designed to appeal to youthful viewers (who won't be watching anyway), 
stick around for the last third of the show, which is the best part. 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTING BEGINS Monday in Rome for a remake of "Three Coins in the Fountain," 
to be a CBS movie under the new title, "Coins in the Fountain." The producers 
won permission from 20th Century-Fox to use the famous Jule Styne-Sammy Cahn 
music. 
</P>
<P>
The three stars are Loni Anderson; the petite but dynamic Stephanie Kramer, 
soon to depart the TV series "Hunter" and "Major Dad's" on-air Mrs., Shana 
Reed. This sequel takes place 20 years after the original, which starred 
Dorothy Maguire, Jean Peters and Maggie McNamara. (There was another version in 
between, titled "The Pleasure Seekers," starring Ann-Margret, Pamela Tiffin and 
Carole Lynley.) 
</P>
<P>
Producer Mike Filerman and director Tony Wharmby tried to cast Italian actors 
whom they interviewed in Rome. Unable to find men who spoke English well enough 
to be understood, they resorted to casting in London.

DRAKE FLUNKS AS EX-PLAYER SUES

Former basketball player Terrell Jackson has sued Drake University for fraud, 
alleging the school reneged on a promise to provide him an education. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was recruited by former Coach Tom Abatemarco in 1988 after attending 
several schools, including Minnesota and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
He quit the team this winter in a dispute that led to the resignation of 
Abatemarco, now an assistant at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 22, seeks punitive and compensatory damages in a suit filed in Polk 
County District Court that also accuses Drake of breach of contract, negligent 
misrepresentation and violation of Jackson's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleged Drake lured Jackson with promises of academic support to 
complete his degree, then made it virtually impossible to receive an education. 
The suit alleged the school, through Abatemarco and his staff, asked Jackson to 
plagiarize term papers, urged him "to register for classes that detracted or 
conflicted least from the basketball schedule and would provide high grades 
essential to maintaining academic eligibility regardless of their academic 
worth."

WEST VIRGINIA TALKS WITH BIG TEN ABOUT JOINING CONFERENCE

West Virginia has talked with Big Ten officials about joining the conference 
should it decide to expand its membership, Mountaineer Athletic Director Ed 
Pastilong said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had informal talks with the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
We have talked with (Big Ten Commissioner) Jim Delany and with some of the 
other member schools," Pastilong said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the Big Ten does consider adding a 12th team that we would be given 
serious consideration," he told the Charleston Daily Mail. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Ten presidents have invited Penn State to join the conference, but that 
situation reportedly has grown shaky because of opposition from some members. 
There also has been speculation, including a story in last week's Sports 
Illustrated, that if Penn State gets in, the conference might add a 12th member 
and go to divisional play.

EASTERN BLOC SPORTS TAKE A BACK SEAT IN THE GAME OF POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JEANSONNE, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a new newspaper in Czechoslovakia, started up since the revolution. 
The name of the publication roughly translates to "The National." It is not a 
sports daily. 
</P>
<P>
Yet sports, as much as any aspect of life in Eastern Bloc nations, had its 
shutters rattled and its windows smashed by last winter's anti-Communist 
storms. For four decades, in the Real Big East, sports had been a lot like it 
is in that basketball conference we always hear so much about: Sports first. 
Win first. Publicity first. All at the expense of the non-elite, the NCAA 
Division IIs and Division IIIs; the intramurals. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that, as democracy struggles to the fore in the Real Big East, 
thereby lowering the priority of sports in the eyes of the new governments, 
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch is campaigning 
to retain the old order. 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch, in an extraordinary meeting with Olympic chiefs from the dissolving 
East Bloc nations last month, pleaded with those officials to sustain their 
elite sports programs. He even brought along the IOC's western marketing team, 
which includes U.S. Olympic Committee Marketing Director John Krimsky, and 
hinted at direct funding from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Samaranch is protecting his own turf. As the Olympics thrived on the 
Cold War, on the "war without bullets" of the Real Big East arguing its 
system's righteousness through sports victories over the West, so too would the 
Olympics suffer if some of its strongest teams suffered. And they are suffering 
in the Real Big East. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany, not knowing where its next mark is coming from, is dismantling a 
government-fed sports colossus that had put that nation of 16 million people on 
an Olympic par with the superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union. Only a 
handful of East German sports, suddenly without state money, have ties to 
life-sustaining corporations, such as track and field. 
</P>
<P>
But even those sports will have lost their biggest selling point in the West: 
They no longer will be the mysterious Blueshirts; they will just wear club 
uniforms like everyone else. Who will want to pay to see that? 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Wall springs leaks and you literally walk through a ragged new hole 
to the other side and pass through East Germany and Hungary and Romania and 
Czechoslovakia and you learn it is not so different from home, in a lot of 
ways. It is old Europe -- cobblestones and public squares filled with statues 
and electric street cars and tiny automobiles that sound like popcorn poppers 
when they idle. It is neglected Europe -- choking pollution from dusty brown 
coal fuel, a scarcity of fresh vegetables and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Any day now, with government censorship gone the way of the Communist 
governments themselves, there could be a sports talk radio station in 
Czechoslovakia. This is possible: "Hey, Mad Dog, this is Jan from Bratislava; 
first-time caller. Love your show, man. Hey, I wanna talk about Coach Pala's 
stupid decision to play Sjerber in the Davis Cup doubles against the United 
States when Sjerber was hurting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
For those who can pick up the signal of the new Eurosport network -- the ESPN 
across the ocean -- Bob McAdoo is shooting jumpers. He plays in the Spanish 
league. The Bo Jackson Nike ads on Eurosport are the same except for the 
addition of a soccer player and a cricket player. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are differences on the other side, most of them the residue of 
the suddenly out-of-fashion Communist ideology 
</P>
<P>
Sigfried Koenig, a fairly high-ranking sports official at East Berlin's 
Turn-und Sportclub Berlin, suggested that sports would have to take a back seat 
in the new government vehicle because "people don't know how they even will pay 
for their flat now." In East Germany, where almost $200 million a year was 
budgeted for elite sports by the old Communist government (a 25% slice of the 
state pie); where there was a nationwide system of scouting prospective 
athletes and placing them in various sports schools and clubs; where there was 
coordinated training of coaches along with networking of scientific and medical 
research, sports are now on their own. Koenig's new job is in "marketing," 
something Eastern Bloc nations never did before. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for sponsors," he said. "We are in urgent need of promotion. If 
you know someone in the U.S.A. interested in East German sports. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In Romania, the best first-division soccer teams, Dinamo and Steuau, have 
contracts with Ford and with an Italian firm, San Plast, but after that, there 
is a scramble to undo what Nicolae Ceausescu did all those years. Longtime 
Romanian Olympic official Alexandru Siperco said Ceausescu, unlike other 
Eastern Bloc rulers, "hated" sports. Soccer fields routinely were ripped out 
and used for planting -- and the crops exported to put more money in 
Ceausescu's full pockets. Seventeen brand-new tennis courts were bulldozed in a 
fit of anger by Ceausescu in August; he simply didn't like looking at them. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, there are some of the most marketable sports in Eastern 
Europe -- ice hockey, tennis and soccer -- but attendance has been on the 
decline in recent years. Plus, no one is trained in marketing in 
Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, the new autonomy in sports has created a chaos of 
athletes, coaches and agents at war with each other for control. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians will tell you now -- elite sports has long since found the cheaper 
outlets: in fencing, soccer and water polo.

SUMMER SQUALL WON'T RUN IN BELMONT STAKES

Summer Squall, second to Unbridled in the Kentucky Derby, will start in the 
Preakness on May 19 but skip the Belmont Stakes on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
The colt will be rested after the Preakness and be prepared for a fall campaign 
that will point toward the Breeders' Cup in New York, Cot Campbell of Dogwood 
Stable, which manages the partnership that owns Summer Squall, said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to a bleeding incident on Feb. 19 in Florida, we've been on an aggressive 
schedule with the colt," Campbell said. "The Preakness will be his fifth race 
in nine weeks. Even though he is bright, sound and sharp, and we couldn't be 
happier with his condition coming up the Preakness, it is not fair to ask him 
for more in the Belmont Stakes." 
</P>
<P>
Because he bled during a workout, Summer Squall raced on the diuretic Lasix in 
Kentucky and will race on it in the Preakness at Pimlico. It is not legal to 
race on any medication in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"His trainer, Neil Howard, and I agree that if we are to run without Lasix -- 
which New York would require -- it would have to be after a good summer's 
rest," Campbell said.

DERBY WINNER CONFRONTS DAUNTING CHALLENGE IN TRIPLE CROWN PURSUIT

Carl Nafzger may have won the Kentucky Derby in his first try, but make no 
mistake, the man has taken his knocks. Behind that million-dollar smile are 
more than a few false teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled's 48-year-old trainer once rode bulls for a living, which explains 
the denture plate he graciously popped out for inspection Sunday while regaling 
a crowd of reporters with tales culled from a rough past. 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger himself got off the bulls and onto horses at the still-tender age of 
27, his decision no doubt hastened by a rubber-necked beast known as 
Eighty-Four Wildman who, not content with simply throwing a rider, developed 
the curious habit of throwing his head far enough back to catch an unsuspecting 
rider flush in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I said," Nafzger explained, "you've got to love going against the grain 
if you're going to ride bulls." 
</P>
<P>
And the same can be said of anyone with designs on the Triple Crown. Because 
staying on top of the racing game as the nation's top thoroughbreds point 
toward Pimlico and the Preakness may prove a good deal more difficult than 
Eighty-Four Wildman. And the air gets thinner from here on out. 
</P>
<P>
Only 11 horses have gone on from victory in the 1 1/4-mile Derby to win the 1 
3/16-mile Preakness and the 1 1/2-mile Belmont -- the first to turn the trick 
being Sir Barton in 1919, the last, Affirmed, in 1978. And a glance at the 
fates that befell the most recent Derby winners reveals what a formidable task 
Unbridled and Nafzger are up against. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the Derby winner is a marked man, or, as was the case two years 
ago with Winning Colors, a marked woman. The filly had only hours earlier 
broken a jinx of seven unsuccessful tries with 12 horses for D. Wayne Lukas in 
1987 when the trainers he had finally beaten began planning their revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knew that the filly could run from the front, and when she did it 
again to win the Derby, rumors floated on the backside the next morning that 
more than one of her challengers at Churchill Downs would be coupled with a 
speedy entry whose only purpose at Pimlico would be to keep Winning Colors from 
running into the lead at her leisure. 
</P>
<P>
Then rival trainer Woody Stephens took the scuttle one step further, vowing 
that he was prepared, if no one else was, to use his exceptional colt Forty 
Niner to ensure that the filly wouldn't have her way in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
"I might finish last," Stephens said, with some bitterness on that Sunday two 
years ago, "but she'll be next-to-last." 
</P>
<P>
And true to his word, Stephens burned up Forty Niner in a desperate gambit to 
send Winning Colors' Triple Crown hopes up in flames. It ignited one of the 
more heated controversies in racing in recent years, but in truth, it only made 
public a code that horsemen have honored for as long as thoroughbreds have gone 
to the post. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Nafzger doesn't inspire the same sort of passion among his colleagues that 
Lukas does. Besides, Stephens isn't drawing cross hairs on Unbridled or anyone 
else for the Preakness. But that doesn't mean that the horse and owner who wore 
the roses so recently won't be in for a little extra attention at the Baltimore 
track two weeks from now. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbridled likes to run from behind and I guarantee you this," said Laz 
Barrera, trainer of the previously unbeaten Derby favorite, Mister Frisky, 
"there won't be 16 horses there, there will only be eight or so. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Unbridled was a good horse all along. But the race (Saturday) was made 
for him. He needed that pace," he added. "But he might not get it like that 
again."

MEET THE KREMLIN'S MR. CONSERVATIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TO REFORMERS, YEGOR LIGACHEV'S NAME IS ALMOST A CURSE. BUT TALK TO THIS TOUGH 
SIBERIAN PEASANT-TURNED-POLITICIAN, AND HE'LL TELL YOU A FEW THINGS ABOUT 
REVOLUTION AND REALISM.

MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is the foremost conservative within the Soviet Union's ruling Politburo and 
knows that to the country's radical reformers he is a political ogre. 
</P>
<P>
He is caricatured mercilessly in the unofficial news media, mocked openly on 
the Moscow stage, featured as a horned devil on political badges, called an 
"ignoramus" in Parliament and attacked with such ferocity at opposition rallies 
that his name is almost a curse in today's highly charged vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
But Yegor K. Ligachev is unmoved by these passions and undeterred in what he 
regards as his mission -- the forthright assertion of traditional socialist 
values as the Soviet Union proceeds with perestroika, the restructuring of the 
country's whole political, economic and social system. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what they say about Ligachev, that he's conservative and hidebound, an 
obstacle to everything progressive," he commented, more bemused than outraged 
by the radicals' many allegations. "But I belong to the realists, I stick to 
common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev, who now oversees agriculture, nevertheless is deeply concerned that 
the Soviet Union remain socialist even as it goes through a profound 
transformation affecting the daily life of every citizen. 
</P>
<P>
The goals of the Bolsheviks in the 1917 Russian Revolution have not 
fundamentally changed, Ligachev contended during an extensive interview with 
The Times, but new ways must be found to achieve them. 
</P>
<P>
"I am far from thinking we are in a crisis of socialism, a crisis of the 
Communist Party," Ligachev said. "We face the result of problems accumulated 
over a long time, problems that stem essentially from the deformation of 
socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its achievement, he said, "the party is influenced negatively by the 
extremely destructive consequences of Stalinism and its arbitrariness, its mass 
repressions, its lawlessness." Moral and ideological decay undermine its 
authority and influence in society, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As to his conservatism, Ligachev quickly summed it up with a Russian proverb: 
"Before entering a room, think how you will get out." 
</P>
<P>
"In politics, before taking a decision, you must think of the consequences," he 
explained. "This we have not always done in perestroika, and we are suffering 
from our errors as a result. That is the extent of my conservatism. I 
wholeheartedly support the socialist transformation of our society through 
perestroika and the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
As the Soviet Union attempts to broaden and accelerate its much-troubled 
reforms, Ligachev's political authority is growing, for his support is sought 
to ensure that the measures win acceptance from like-minded party officials who 
retain considerable influence throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
If Ligachev has become the emblematic conservative of perestroika, he is also 
among the most enigmatic of the present Soviet leaders, to many a faceless 
apparatchik with a 45-year career in the party bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
And that Ligachev does regret, for in the Soviet Union's new era of competitive 
politics, those many years as a willing instrument of party policy place him at 
a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
His passionate advocacy of socialism as well as the pungency of his criticism 
of the radicals is lost in the gray pages of Pravda, the party newspaper. Boris 
N. Yeltsin, the radical populist, whom Ligachev originally brought to Moscow 
but who now campaigns for Ligachev's ouster from the Politburo, scores his 
points and escapes unscathed by any rebuttal. And Ligachev is finding it 
difficult to turn the mass support he believes he has among ordinary workers 
and farmers into political leverage at the center. 
</P>
<P>
The charge, so frequent among radicals, that he became a party official in the 
times of dictator Josef Stalin and remains a Stalinist today rankles more than 
any other accusation. "People in my family were executed under Stalin, people 
in my family were expelled from the party by Stalin and exiled by Stalin," 
Ligachev said. "I know from life, not from books, what Stalinism was and what 
it did to people and why we must never allow it again." 
</P>
<P>
Trained as an aeronautical engineer during World War II, Ligachev turned to 
political work, first in the Communist Youth League and then in the party and 
government. While still in his 30s, he oversaw the establishment of 
Akademgorodok, the Siberian science city outside Novosibirsk, from which many 
of Gorbachev's advisers have come; he ran the Siberian region of Tomsk, a key 
industrial center, as the party leader there for 18 years, and he was brought 
to Moscow in 1983 by the late Yuri Andropov to oversee the rejuvenation of the 
apparat, the party machine, as a man who was free of the cronyism and 
corruption of the years of Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
As the party secretary for internal organizational matters, Ligachev was in a 
key position at the death in 1985 of Konstantin Chernenko, Andropov's 
successor, and he unhesitatingly swung all the support he could to Gorbachev 
and a program of reform. "We could have made quite different decisions," he 
reflected several years later, "and sometimes I think what would have happened 
to the country." 
</P>
<P>
Born into a Siberian peasant family, Ligachev proudly remains a Siberian. He 
speaks with the deep, rounded vowels of Siberia, he remains direct, frank and 
undevious and he values the freedom characteristic of Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
"My motherland is Siberia," he said. "People there are special -- open, 
friendly, courageous, resourceful, self-reliant, honest, morally upright and 
just. They have been shaped by life on the frontier, by the need to develop 
huge resources, by a very rigorous climate, by being very far from the center 
and its political intrigue." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev's chief pleasures are his family -- his wife, Zinaida, a retired 
foreign language teacher; his mathematician son, Alexander; his 
daughter-in-law, Yelena, who is also a scientist, and a grandson, Alexei, a 
student at a military institute. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev is a reader -- virtually all the Russian classics, which are re-read 
over and over, and most of the contemporary Soviet writers -- and a music lover 
who is seen frequently at symphony concerts and operas in Moscow. He is a skier 
and a bicycle rider. His intellectual and physical vigor are those of a much 
younger man. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the controversy around him, Ligachev has remained primarily a party 
man, and Gorbachev's defense of him against radical critics more than two years 
ago still stands. 
</P>
<P>
"He would lay down his life for it," Gorbachev said of Ligachev's devotion to 
the party. "He wears his heart on his sleeve. He's an open, militant, emotional 
man -- but with great political experience." 
</P>

Hubert Selby Jr.'s "Last Exit to Brooklyn" is the one landmark American novel 
you would never expect to see filmed. When it was published in 1964, it sparked 
an immediate controversy, both legal and critical, for its raw, poetic 
descriptions of brutal Brooklyn lowlife with uncompromising depictions of 
violence, much of it sexual, between human beings. 
</P>
<P>
(The controversy still hasn't subsided -- at least not in Orange County, where 
the Edwards chain last week canceled plans to show the movie at its posh Lido 
Cinema, claiming the adult themes were inappropriate for that theater; the 
movie is rated R. The movie is being shown at the AMC MainPlace Six at 
MainPlace/Santa Ana.) 
</P>
<P>
Selby himself, though, says he always saw "Last Exit" as a movie, even if he 
did have to wait a quarter of a century for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who writes as graphically as I do envisions a movie," he said, sitting 
in his neat, pleasant West Hollywood apartment. "I've always loved movies. Back 
when I was out of my head, I'd see seven movies a day on 42nd Street. I loved 
shoot 'em-ups, Randolph Scott Westerns, especially. That Randy was so cool. I 
remember when he snuffed out Lee Marvin -- and he'd been using his rifle as a 
crutch." (It happened in Budd Boetticher's 1956 classic "Seven Men From Now.") 
</P>
<P>
"And I love the movie they've made of 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' for two basic 
reasons. The first reason is personal, self-serving: They've retained the 
spirit of the book -- that dark, oppressive flavor. Second, they made a great 
movie, in my opinion. That's a great combination." The movie is by two Germans, 
producer Bernd Eichinger and director Uli Edel, who themselves had dreamed of 
filming "Last Exit" for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
At 61, Selby is an underground legend in American letters who, thanks to the 
film, may be on the brink of enjoying a measure of the recognition, not to 
mention the financial security, that Charles Bukowski now enjoys. If anything, 
Selby has lived a harder life than Bukowski, and it has taken its toll. At 115 
pounds -- 35 pounds underweight, he says -- he seems painfully thin, yet he 
moves with vigor. The haunted-looking eyes in his gaunt face are a clear, 
intense blue and as unforgettable as his stories. Selby retains Brooklyn in his 
voice and has a hearty, uninhibited survivor's laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, they hire armed guards to keep the writer away, but I was involved in 
every aspect of the making of the movie," he explained. "I read every draft of 
Desmond Nakano's script, I was on the set every day and went to dailies. It was 
a wonderful, breathtaking experience. I liked Bernie so much I even wrote a 
poem about him." 
</P>
<P>
Selby is asked whether he approves of the softening of the fate of the 
prostitute Tralala, in a sequence involving a gang rape that, in the book, ends 
with a memorably savage killing. "Just because I think the movie's great 
doesn't mean I agree with every shot," said Selby forthrightly. ". . . Bernd 
thought it would be better on the screen his way, but he didn't make any 
changes for Hollywood reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sex is an attack in many ways. Most people confuse sex with 
communication and love. 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' is about the horrors of a 
loveless world, and that's been my main observation all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Selby, however, was not reared in the world of "Last Exit." He grew up mainly 
in Bay Ridge, a middle-class Brooklyn neighborhood where his mother still 
lives. "My father was a marine engineer, a merchant seaman who later worked in 
powerhouses. He went back to the sea in World War II, and then I went to sea. I 
was just restless. I couldn't stand still, couldn't stand school, couldn't 
stand me!" 
</P>
<P>
At 15 he quit school and left home to work on the Brooklyn waterfront. At 18, 
on his first voyage on a freighter, he contracted tuberculosis and spent nearly 
four years in hospitals. It was during this long recuperation that Selby 
started to read -- "I loved S.S. Van Dine and Mickey Spillane" -- and 
eventually discovered he had a desire to write. His mentor was a fellow 
Brooklynite named Gilbert Sorrentino, who today is a Stanford professor. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go to Birdland and Bop City and the Royal Roost. I knew enough to keep my 
mouth shut, which was unusual for me, when the group started talking about 
William Carlos Williams (who subsequently was to encourage Selby to keep 
writing) and Ezra Pound. Then I'd sneak over to the library and read them." 
</P>
<P>
Selby married, and when his daughter was 2 he suffered such a severe asthma 
attack that he was expected to die. "I had already been given up for dead three 
times, but again I refused to die. Nobody tells me what to do! But I did have a 
spiritual experience: I'd either die and regret my entire life or live my life 
over and then die. I had to do something with my life, so I bought a 
typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat there a week, and wrote 'The Queen Is Dead.' (It later became part of 
the six stories that make up "Last Exit," and the only one based on an actual 
individual; Selby had heard of the prostitute Tralala but never met her.) I 
wrote a dozen pages and realized I had no idea what I was doing. I meditated 
two days. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has a million stories -- just go to every street corner or candy 
store in New York and you can hear them. What I must do, I told myself, is to 
understand them, to get down to their basics, and from their essence, create a 
work of art." 
</P>
<P>
The work that emerged, of course, was "Last Exit." And after its success, Selby 
resumed his heavy drinking habit. "I've always been an alcoholic. I can't 
remember when I didn't want to drink. With money coming in, I had the means to 
pursue my disease with exuberance." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Selby was living in Los Angeles, in one of the many attempts to 
have "Last Exit" or one of its portions filmed. He was living with a woman who 
one day gave shelter to a homeless family. A friend came over to see them and 
ended up persuading Selby to join Alcoholics Anonymous. "I had my last drink on 
29 March, 1969," he said with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Selby resumed writing, published several more novels, moved East for a few 
years and then came back to Los Angeles in 1983 with the youngest of his four 
children -- he had two children by his first wife and two more by his third 
(from whom he has been amicably separated for seven years). 
</P>
<P>
"Friends gave us everything. I was on welfare, $400 a month and $78 in food 
stamps. I would come home and cry, but we prayed together every morning and 
somehow survived." 
</P>
<P>
Selby has held so many odd jobs -- "very odd," he emphasized -- that he hasn't 
the heart to recite them all beyond mentioning pumping gas in San Fernando 
Valley and a fairly recent stint working weekends as gift-shop clerk at Le 
Mondrian. 
</P>
<P>
More appropriately, he has for two years conducted a graduate fiction workshop 
at USC and recently completed a European tour of poetry readings with Henry 
Rollins. Best of all, he's at work on a new novel, "Seeds of Passion, Seeds of 
Pain." And the screen version of "Last Exit to Brooklyn" might well make him 
some real money. 
</P>
<P>
As for that prospect, Selby said, borrowing the last line from "The Sun Also 
Rises": "Isn't it pretty to think so?" 
</P>
<P>
 'Last Exit to Brooklyn" is at the AMC MainPlace Six at MainPlace/Santa Ana.
