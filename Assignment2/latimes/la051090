AL MARTINEZ: STRESS AND THE MAHARISHI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a stressful world, and everyone needs a way to keep his head from 
exploding. I saw a head explode once and it isn't a pretty sight. Walls were 
spattered with shards of suppressed rage, sinewy strips of free-floating 
anxiety and small, hairy chunks of an inability to cope. It took weeks to clean 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Some method of reducing tension is obviously necessary if we are to survive in 
today's tense urban environment. There are hundreds of techniques, from 
squeezing rubber balls to screaming in the cemetery where your mother is 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
Someone in our neighborhood, for instance, beats tom-toms occasionally to, one 
presumes, put him or her (or them) into a state of restful meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Others down the block gather to chant in an effort to attain nirvana. The chant 
assumes a humming quality and on certain quiet nights sounds like a horde of 
wasps descending on Sweet Jesus Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
But if it helps ease stress, I say go for it. A Hum and Tom-Tom Band might even 
be in order. 
</P>
<P>
There are dangers to stress-reduction, of course. A friend tried yoga once to 
quiet his Furies and became entangled in a position from which he was unable to 
free himself. His wife was out of town and he was near starvation by the time 
someone found and untangled him. 
</P>
<P>
My point, if indeed I have one, is that there's no safe, sure-fire way of 
reducing stress and finding perfect peace. Unless, of course, you live in a 
City of Immortals. 
</P>
<P>
It's this way. There's a company called the Maharishi Heaven on Earth 
Development Corp. that is promoting the creation of 50 stress-free communities 
based on the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru of transcendental 
meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Company headquarters are in Malibu, but you probably already suspected that. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to build tracts in accordance with natural laws, to the extent that 
houses will be placed on sites that utilize cosmic energy and are at peace with 
those spiritual cross-currents that enhance the beneficial purpose of each 
room. 
</P>
<P>
You'll walk into a dining room of such a home, for instance, and enjoy a 
healthy appetite. In the den, your most complex thoughts will snap into focus. 
In the bedroom, you'll feel either sleepy or sexually stimulated. I personally 
feel stimulated in the kitchen, but our house wasn't built under the 
Maharishi's Vedic guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Parks, vegetable gardens, nontoxic building materials and a kind of holistic 
conditioning are expected to create a collective happiness in each City of 
Immortals not unlike that enjoyed in the old days by Ozzie and Harriet Nelson 
on Sycamore Street. 
</P>
<P>
Picture the Nelsons, the Cleavers, kindly Dr. Kildare, Henry Aldrich, Aunt Bee, 
little Opie and the gang from "Father Knows Best" living in the same glorious 
neighborhood and you'll have some idea of what the corporation hopes to achieve 
in its heavenly communities. 
</P>
<P>
Transcendental meditation, or TM, for those ignorant of psychic 
self-improvement, taps one's universal energy to create a state of "restful 
alertness" that clears the mind, improves health and frees you from tension, 
anxiety and stress. 
</P>
<P>
Kinda makes you wanna sing and dance. 
</P>
<P>
I stopped by the office of the Heaven on Earth Co. the other day and talked 
with men in suits and ties who somehow seemed more . . . well . . . serene than 
most people. One was Curtis McDonald, a vice president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
This all began, I was told, two years ago at a gathering in India where the 
Maharishi declared that the problem of war was over and mankind ought to 
concentrate on quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The concept somehow evolved into real estate speculation that shaped the notion 
of sweet-peace cities, a dozen of which are in various stage of development in 
the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between them and any other high-priced communities, McDonald 
says, is the removal of stress through many means, including programs of 
purification involving diet, exercise, meditation and, of course, the 
Gandharva-Ved music concerts with which we are all so familiar. 
</P>
<P>
When I suggested that stress might be a little difficult to leave behind in 
this era of people with Uzis who do not abide by the principles of spiritual 
fulfillment, he assured me that, in that case, security systems would be 
incorporated into each of the housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
Where good vibes fail, hire guards. 
</P>
<P>
This all sounds pretty good to me and I plan on moving into a City of Immortals 
myself. The possible intrusion of criminal mischief doesn't worry me at all. I 
am confident that Sheriff Andy of Mayberry, and his sidekick Barney, will be 
around to keep me safe and serene.

Some educators and parents have condemned youthful Bart Simpson, controversial 
subject of those "Underachiever" T-shirts. So it came as something of a 
surprise the other day when a Loyola Marymount University announcement said 
that Simpson would deliver the school's commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
The press release disclosed that Bart, the cartoon son on TV's "The Simpsons," 
would "receive an honorary junior high school diploma" because "he symbolizes 
everything this University is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Hold that mortarboard. 
</P>
<P>
The press release was not the work of the university, but of Loyola student 
Brian Gurwitz, who pasted the school letterhead on a fake release and sent out 
200 copies. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to find a humorous way to protest the fact that there was going to be 
no commencement speaker," said Gurwitz, a member of the student Senate. "There 
were rumors that a Cabinet official was going to be the speaker but had changed 
his mind, so the university decided to go without one." 
</P>
<P>
The hoax spurred debate on the subject, and the university finally announced 
that Loyola basketball coach Paul Westhead would speak at Saturday's 
commencement. 
</P>
<P>
Gurwitz, incidentally, will be among those achievers graduating. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I was able to do this (hoax)," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
It could be the next Civil Service position: Trash cop. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant to the county has completed a "Feasibility Study for a Uniform 
Recycling Program" that includes a recommendation for such a class of officers. 
Their duties would be to "randomly select a floor or section and check who is 
actively recycling by looking in individual trash bins at the end of the day."

While several publishers continue negotiations with us for the rights to "The 
Golden Treasury of Malathion Poems," we are now planning a second volume, "The 
Malathion Song Book."

(sung to the tune of "Green Acres"):

Two years ago to the day, followers of the 16th-Century French seer Nostradamus 
predicted that disaster would strike L.A. 
</P>
<P>
They were correct. 
</P>
<P>
The disaster was a Caltrans promotion designed to encourage car-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Guest star Rick Dees, the KIIS radio disc jockey, stationed himself on an 
overpass of the Ventura Freeway, offering $100 prizes to the driver of any 
passing vehicle that he described on the air -- if the driver exited and 
reported to the deejay's mobile unit. 
</P>
<P>
Money-hungry drivers were observed cutting across several lanes to get to Dees. 
Traffic was gridlocked for 15 miles. 
</P>
<P>
How could Nostradamus have known? 
</P>
<P>
In the L.A. Tall Tales Contest sponsored by Toastmasters International in San 
Pedro, Ivan Gerson recounted how he fell down a cavern into hell after an 
earthquake and stumbled upon a weight-loss seminar being taught by Elvis 
Presley. Gerson finished third. Maybe one of the judges found the story 
plausible.

WELLESLEY CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Granted that the discussion surrounding Barbara Bush's commencement speech at 
Wellesley College is a healthy process as your editorial suggested ("First Lady 
vs. Wellesley: Good Debate," May 7), but the nature of that discussion reflects 
very poorly on the women there. 
</P>
<P>
First, it is shortsighted of the women at Wellesley to limit accomplishment and 
leadership in society to the realms of business and government. And secondly, 
it is very insecure and defensive behavior that has to speak ill of another 
woman's choice in order to affirm the value of her own. 
</P>
<P>
The family is a vitally significant and foundational institution of this 
nation, upon which the success of many of our other pursuits (including George 
Bush's) depends. A full-time, even lifetime, commitment to nurturing and 
building the family is influence and leadership in the fullest sense of the 
role. 
</P>
<P>
The choice between a career in the work force or a career in the home is a 
difficult and emotional one. To hear women on both sides of that choice 
continually downgrading the other as if the choice were actually a plain and 
simple one only makes one wonder how sure of their personal choices these women 
actually are. 
</P>
<P>
Women have the potential to provide significant leadership in more than one 
role. What's so horrible about that? These efforts would be better served if 
women stopped viewing other women's choices as negative comments about their 
own and went about the business of providing leadership in their respective 
roles.

KRAUTHAMMER ON CENSORSHIP AND CINCINNATI ART EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington's eternal sophomore, Charles Krauthammer ("We All Believe in 
Censorship," Commentary, April 29), would conscript us into his argument for 
governmental censorship based upon a series of false assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of censorship is to regulate the morality of thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of restricted access is not to achieve "the smallest possible 
audience," but to obtain the most voluntary audience. 
</P>
<P>
Images stimulate thoughts. Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs and Krauthammer's 
simplistic descriptions of them prompt similar, if aesthetically different, 
thoughts. The harmful effect of such thoughts is easier to assert than to 
prove. Censors seem always to be endowed with the ability to survive greater 
exposure to these materials than the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
What goes in a public gallery is best decided by a curator who understands the 
purpose of the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Those citizens of Cincinnati who are burdened with "small, censoring minds," 
even if they were a majority, should not seek to impose their handicap on 
others. 
</P>
<P>
As the people of Eastern Europe know, when bureaucrats undertake the invention 
of thought-crimes, freedom and democracy disappear. And, if his billboard 
project results in his arrest, I pledge $100 to the Krauthammer Legal Defense 
Fund. But be careful; even "exquisite flower pictures" can be nasty.

PROP. 109: GOVERNOR NEEDS IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 109 is designed to give California governors more time to decide 
whether proposed new laws are good for the state or not. We recommend a Yes 
vote because it is irresponsible to argue for speed when bad law may result. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, Gov. George Deukmejian had to decide whether to sign or 
veto 1,700 bills, all but 300 of which were introduced in the final months of 
the session. 
</P>
<P>
Because it was an odd-numbered year, he had just 12 days after each bill 
arrived to decide whether he should sign it or whether some technical or policy 
flaw called for a veto. After l2 days, the calendar snatches the matter away 
from him. Under the state Constitution, a bill becomes law whether the governor 
likes it or not. 
</P>
<P>
In even-numbered years, the governor gets 30 days to decide. The assumption is 
that bills that are carried over from odd to even years tend to be more 
controversial than bills that sail through. That being the case, it is presumed 
that the governor is entitled to more time to look them over. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 109, supported by Deukmejian, would extend the review period to 30 
days for all sessions. The only formal opposition argues that the extension of 
time for analysis would give lobbyists and others more time to twist the 
governor's arm and make back-room deals, which says, in effect, that there 
should be time for back-room deals only every other year. The governor is 
entitled to all the time he can get. He is entitled to a Yes on Proposition 
109.

PULL THE PLUG ON SALVADOR'S NO-WIN WAR; 
</P>
<P>
ONLY A U.S. AID CUT WILL GET BOTH SIDES TO NEGOTIATE A PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. WOOD, Father William J. Wood, SJ, is executive director of the 
California Catholic Conferece, the public-policy arm of the state's bishops. He 
has had a particular interest in El Salvador since 1977, and as part of a 
fact-finding delegation met last summer with top government officials there. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 10 years, Congress appears primed to cut military aid to El Salvador in 
another attempt to bring that country's civil war to a negotiated peace. 
Legislation headed for House debate next week would cut half of the $85 million 
budgeted for this year and cancel the remainder if the Salvadoran government 
does not make progress on several fronts concerning peace and justice. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to the proponents, this is just another halfway measure. 
It would only perpetuate the game-playing we've been mired in for the last 
decade. Our government must have the decency to drop the pretenses that it has 
used to sell its El Salvador policy. As a first step, we must tell the 
Salvadoran military that we've got their number, that we will no longer support 
their subversion of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The paralysis of the situation was made clear to Congress by a task force 
chaired by Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.), which reported that the official 
investigation into the murder of the six Jesuits last November has "come to a 
virtual standstill." Although soldiers conducted the massacre of the priests 
and two employees at the Jesuit-run Central American University, there has been 
no effort to determine whether the armed forces high command played a role. 
Last weekend, it was reported that evidence crucial to the prosecution was 
missing, and that soldiers who were potential witnesses had been transferred 
abroad and were unavailable to testify. 
</P>
<P>
That may be the last straw. Finally, our government may be persuaded to 
consider whether U.S. military assistance to El Salvador is in anyone's best 
interest. A diplomatic settlement must be worked out. And negotiations toward 
such a settlement must be tied to a wider agreement for the whole of Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
The civil war in El Salvador is unwinnable. The army has not prevailed, even 
with billions of dollars of U.S. support, including state-of-the-art training 
and equipment. Similarly, the FMLN guerrillas have demonstrated that they are 
unable to win and cannot be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to a diplomatic settlement, therefore, is another decade of 
brutal violence that decides nothing. 
</P>
<P>
All that Archbishop Oscar A. Romero predicted about the results of U.S. 
military aid has come true in spades. In February, 1980, Romero wrote to 
President Jimmy Carter begging him not to send military assistance to the 
government of El Salvador, warning that a blood bath would ensue. A month 
later, Romero himself was felled by an assassin's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military assistance came nonetheless, in the form of advisers and training 
teams and money for aircraft, artillery, sophisticated weapons of war and 
ammunition. And the blood flowed. In 10 years, more than 70,000 people have 
been killed, most of them civilians, including infants and children and church 
workers and charity volunteers whose only offense was trying to care for the 
hungry, the orphaned, the sick. 
</P>
<P>
The Jesuit priests and their housekeepers who were brutally murdered in 
November were not the last to be killed by bullets made in the U.S.A. In 
February, 16 children were among the civilians killed or maimed by an 
unprovoked Salvadoran Air Force attack on the village of Corral de Piedra in 
Chalatenango province. 
</P>
<P>
President Alfredo Cristiani's government has had a year in office to prove 
itself, and has been found wanting. The persistent abuses by the Salvadoran 
military, the mockery of justice, the refusal to pursue a non-military 
settlement of the civil war should be proof enough to anyone that our policy is 
on the wrong course. 
</P>
<P>
Our government needs to get three messages across to the Salvadoran government 
and the military Establishment: First, we will no longer make excuses for their 
failings or finance their corrupt practices and human-rights abuses. Second, we 
will not waste the U.S. taxpayers' money to feed the tragic illusion that there 
can be a military solution to El Salvador's problems. Instead, our government 
will commit itself at the highest level to fostering a negotiated settlement as 
part of a wider diplomatic approach to security for the region as a whole. 
Finally, we are willing to participate in the development of a plan to replace 
the military aid with the economic assistance so desperately needed to address 
the causes of the conflict that is destroying El Salvador.

Most politicians aspire to be petunias, pleasant commonplace flowers in the 
public garden. Then there is John Silber, the candidate as thistle. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for kinder and gentler, look elsewhere. Silber, 63, a former 
professor of philosophy, is on leave from the presidency of Boston University 
where he frequently fought with the faculty. He is seeking the Democratic 
gubernatorial nomination in Massachusetts. "I don't speak plastic," he says. 
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
On his salary, the highest among university presidents: "I'm not embarrassed to 
get one-quarter of what a mindless anchorman on TV gets. I'm not average." Any 
pledge not to raise taxes "borders on insanity." Jesse Jackson (Silber can't 
endure "the mindless, rhyming pieces of nonsense on which he has built a 
career") might be Cabinet material because every President's Cabinet "needs 
someone to write bumper stickers." 
</P>
<P>
His tongue has always been tart. When the young Bill Bennett, now drug czar, 
was Silber's student, Silber compared his doctoral dissertation to Texas chili: 
"Mostly beans and mush with the occasional meat." 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong educator who has taught at Yale and Texas, his words on schools are 
especially unminced. Many schools are "institutionalized programs of child 
neglect." The curriculum of the typical school of education ("certifying the 
ineducable to be educators") amounts to "a two- or three-year negative 
intelligence test." A voucher system would mean "the end of public education" 
unless teachers' unions allowed outside evaluations of teachers and ensured 
that they are "worthy mentors and available to pupils as needed." 
</P>
<P>
He favors a state examination for all high-school seniors. A school in which 
fewer than 80% pass would be on probation. Two consecutive such years and the 
school would be decertified and denied public funds. 
</P>
<P>
When Silber says back to basics, he means basics: We should begin by teaching 
children something that, in earlier times, reality taught them through the 
deaths of siblings and elders: "They are going to die." Sound education depends 
on this contact with reality. The Bush campaign theme was "Don't worry, be 
happy." Silber's is: Life is real, life is earnest, life is short. 
</P>
<P>
In a time of cloying national triumphalism, Silber's is the voice of a scold. 
He believes America has become self-indulgent, enervated by wealth and 
demoralized by bad philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Self-indulgent? Educational standards "are derisory by standards that were 
operative in ordinary little country schools a hundred years ago." Enervated? 
The affluence that capitalism produces is dissolving the virtues -- 
industriousness, deferral of gratification -- that capitalism requires. Bad 
philosophy? The transformation of whims into "needs," then into "rights," 
proceeds on the assumption that "sincerity" creates "values" and a no-fault 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Although Silber, like a lot of Democrats, voted for Ronald Reagan and George 
Bush, he calls himself "a traditional liberal Democrat." He led a Texas 
campaign against capital punishment, helped found the Head Start program, and 
says that without preschool programs for children aged 3, 4 and 5 who lack 
adequate adult care at home, "we can only talk emptily about equality of 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
If Democrats can find the nerve to nominate him, he should win in a state where 
only 14% of voters are Republicans and Republican candidates must attract 
disaffected Democrats who think liberalism has become woolly-headed. However, 
his party may be unnerved by the accusation that he is "insensitive." He says 
charges of "insensitivity" are used to make many sensitive subjects, such as 
sex and race, undiscussable. 
</P>
<P>
Recently he was denounced for saying that a woman has an opportunity to be a 
pretty girl between, say, ages 15 and 25. Critics called him insensitive to 
women over 25. But Silber said what he said while discussing a Yeats poem 
(specifically, the line "What shall I do for pretty girls now my old bawd is 
dead?") in a high-school class that Silber says included "exceedingly scruffy, 
dirty, ill-kempt young girls." He told them they were in a wonderful window of 
life and instead of luxuriating in their loveliness "they were throwing it away 
with the assiduous effort to be repulsive." 
</P>
<P>
Is Silber impolitic? Perhaps. If so, so much the worse for Massachusetts' 
polity. But if this, the only state that George McGovern carried in 1972, can 
elect the nation's most interesting candidate in 1990, the Democratic Party may 
find many Democrats coming home to it.

By EDWARD GUZMAN was a $7,000-a-month commissioned manufacturers representative 
to Southern California offshore oil interests when the bottom dropped out of 
the industry in 1985. The Times asked his thoughts about the possibility of 
more drilling in new areas off the California coast. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oil companies spend major dollars building facilities and getting permits, 
then the environmentalists come along and stall it. 
</P>
<P>
The approach we took (on past drilling) was well-thought and well-engineered. 
</P>
<P>
The public needs to be aware of the safety factors. We have a tanker incident 
in Alaska and one in Long Beach -- those were not a result of drilling and 
production, they were a result of shipping. If people have a great concern 
about a ship rupturing, then they should take a look at what I consider to be a 
safer alternative, and that's through a pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
You can't compare the old Oklahoma days of crude oil with what's happening 
offshore today. An offshore operation is so technologically oriented, and the 
platforms are being directed by such highly trained engineers, that the risk to 
the environment has been considerably lessened.

BUSH HAS CAUGHT UP TO THE MOUNTEBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS, Christopher Matthews writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush has blown the whistle on the country's long-building fiscal crisis, 
agreeing to Capitol Hill budget talks "with no preconditions." After 10 years 
of credit-card Pentagon spending, Barnum &amp; Bailey tax breaks and 
trillion-dollar check-kiting, America is faced with fiscal reality. Ronald 
Reagan was lucky; George Bush is getting to pay the piper. 
</P>
<P>
Why, after riding piggyback on the bucking Reagan mustang the last decade, is 
George Bush finally jumping off? 
</P>
<P>
The best answer might be that he isn't Ronald Reagan. Beneath the occasional 
giddiness, beneath the heel-clicking loyalty to "supply-side" economics, 
beneath the "read my lips" pretension, is a man of gut-level sanity. Bush likes 
being President. He's not about to have his Administration destroyed by a 
fiscal policy that he was the first to nail as "voodoo economics." 
</P>
<P>
In asking Democratic leaders to negotiate a budget deal, President Bush is back 
to his political starting point. Ten years ago, he said the country couldn't 
afford to tax like Coolidge and spend like Rockefeller. It was Reagan who said 
that those big tax cuts would bring in more money than the government would 
know what to do with, that those hefty federal deficits would ultimately take 
care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, Reagan is back in California and Bush is back to his more 
accustomed role as a no-frills fiscal conservative. When you think about it, 
Bush has spent the last 10 years of his life walking in the trail of that 
charming old mountebank Ronald Reagan. Each had his own, differing plans for 
the presidency back then. Bush offered the conventional treatments -- less 
government spending, better management, fiscal prudence. 
</P>
<P>
The other fellow had a zippier economic medicine to sell. Buy a bottle of his 
medicine, fellow, and you get a 30%, wallet-stuffing tax cut. Your country got 
enough missiles and manpower to scare the ayatollah all the way back to Paris. 
And none of it would cost you a plugged nickel. 
</P>
<P>
America loved the mountebank. His stories were as good as Lincoln's. His jokes 
were the best since Jack Kennedy's. His tricks seemed downright Houdinilike . . 
. for a while. 
</P>
<P>
This week, George Bush finally caught up to the mountebank, and his message to 
the country could not have been clearer. Ronald Reagan may have enjoyed playing 
Coolidge, but this President has no intention of playing Hoover.

SmithKline Beecham PLC: The newly merged health, household products and 
pharmaceuticals company based in London said first-quarter net income rose 42% 
to $371 million, while revenue advanced 16% to $2.142 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The firm attributed the gain to continued strong sales, particularly in 
pharmaceuticals and animal health. The results were the first since the merger 
of SmithKline Beckman Corp. and Beecham PLC in July, 1989. Year-earlier figures 
were made available as if the merger had taken place at the beginning of 1989.

COMPUTER FILE: DIAGNOSING WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Have IBM-compatible personal computers gotten so complicated that you need 
special software just to tell what equipment is in your machine and how it is 
configured? 
</P>
<P>
At least three publishers are betting that enough people will think so and buy 
their new system-diagnostic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Control Room from Ashton-Tate, Check It from TouchStone Software and System 
Sleuth from Dariana Technology Group share some features, yet each is 
different. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three, Control Room ($129) is most clearly aimed at the casual computer 
user. It writes an easily understood report about the computer and gives the 
user control of some system settings. 
</P>
<P>
Check It ($150) performs elaborate tests of your hardware and would be most 
useful when searching out the cause of problems. It isn't hard to use, but some 
of the information it imparts will be understood by only the more technically 
minded users. 
</P>
<P>
System Sleuth ($149) doesn't test things or control things. Instead, it does 
the deepest system analysis, revealing which of your memory-resident software 
programs are colliding with others, for instance, and giving exacting details 
of how your memory is being used. 
</P>
<P>
Control Room features a menu of function choices across the top of the screen. 
You make your choice, and a screen full of information slides into position 
sideways across your monitor. It is easy to use, with extensive on-screen help 
available. That makes up for the slender manual accompanying it -- which gives 
just a teaser of what the program does. 
</P>
<P>
There is a "summary" screen that details facts about your computer's hardware, 
the type and speed of its microprocessor and math co-processor, amount and type 
of memory, hard disk size and speed, size and presence of floppy disk drives, 
DOS version and serial and parallel ports. 
</P>
<P>
A "memory" section tells you how your computer's memory is being used. It 
shows, for instance, that Control Room, part of which is memory-resident, took 
up 7.1 of the 124 kilobytes being used in my 640-kilobyte computer before I ran 
my main application programs. 
</P>
<P>
The "config" section shows you all of the utility programs and other 
instructions that get loaded at start-up into your computer from the 
"autoexec.bat" file. Without having to edit that complex file, you can tell 
Control Room which programs to turn off next time you start the machine. 
</P>
<P>
Another section lets you set the speed at which keys will repeat, the number of 
keystrokes that can be typed ahead of the keyboard's ability to process them 
(keyboard buffer size) and other factors. You can also create up to 60 macros 
in which a series of keystrokes -- commands and text -- are assigned to a key 
combination for playback at any time. The idea is to help speed up repeated 
tasks that you perform at your keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
Under "tasks," you can restore erased files or erase files to government 
standards so that no trace of the old data remains. You can encrypt files to 
keep them secret and scan diskettes for signs of viruses. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to actually test your hardware instead of just identifying it, 
Check It is the program to choose. It analyzes your computer and, at your 
command, selectively tests virtually every component from memory chips to hard 
and floppy disks to the keyboard, serial and parallel ports and the monitor. 
Hard disk and memory testing is particularly rigorous. 
</P>
<P>
One test even checks the second-by-second accuracy of the computer's clock and 
calendar. Another will test your printer. Yet another tells whether your mouse 
is working properly, if you have one. 
</P>
<P>
Some major-brand computers, such as IBM and Compaq, come with their own system 
diagnostic software that performs similar tests. But they don't report the 
results as well. Many other computers do not include such software and the only 
way to test them has generally been to have the dealer do it. Check It changes 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Another nice feature comes into play when a memory chip fails. There is a 
graphic depiction showing you which chips have died. That can save either you 
or your service person a lot of trial and error removing and replacing chips 
trying to find the right one. 
</P>
<P>
All computers have places in their memory called interrupts and special 
channels for direct memory access. Check It tells you which are being used, and 
that simplifies the installation of network cards and other system expansion 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
Check It's manual is thorough and easily understood, providing an excellent 
tutorial on how your hardware works. 
</P>
<P>
System Sleuth, for which version 2.1 is now available, takes a third approach 
to diagnoses. It delves deeper into the internal logic of your computer's 
various components but doesn't test them to the extent that Check It does. 
</P>
<P>
The program has several uniquely useful features. One gives you a pictorial 
representation of how your computer believes its internal system switches are 
set. On older PC- and XT-style computers, such switches physically control the 
way the computer works and what equipment it can use. They are notoriously 
difficult to set properly, especially after you lose the book that shows how. 
</P>
<P>
Newer computers don't have as many switches, relying on special "setup" 
software to do the job. Either way, System Sleuth shows you what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
While System Sleuth does not test the hard disk, it provides information 
different from the other two programs. All hard disks are assigned a "type" 
number, which you may need to know if you ever need to completely clean 
everything off the disk and prepare it all over again for use with new 
partitions and formatting. But unless you open up the computer, you seldom can 
find that information -- and even then it may not be there. The sleuth reports 
the drive type number and also tells you exactly how your hard disk is 
partitioned -- as one big drive or several smaller "logical" drives. 
</P>
<P>
If your computer has a habit of locking up in the middle of running programs, 
it may mean that memory-resident programs are colliding with each other. System 
Sleuth will give you a map of exactly what system resources are being used by 
each such program loaded into your computer, and you can quickly see whether 
and where interferences are occurring. 
</P>
<P>
The program also displays in great detail how system interrupts are assigned, 
as well as the uses of system memory. These are details that help resolve 
potential conflicts when installing network and other system expansion cards. 
</P>
<P>
The depth of System Sleuth's analysis makes it the most technical of the three 
programs and thus the least easily understood by casual users. Skilled 
technicians who are actively involved in configuring and trouble-shooting a 
variety of computers will find it most useful. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that IBM-compatible computers are complicated enough to fool all three 
programs on occasion, however. 
</P>
<P>
Control Room couldn't figure out that I had a third floppy drive connected to 
one computer I tested. Check It thought part of the memory was bad on a Compaq 
386S because a Compaq memory management program didn't work the way it thought 
the program should. And System Sleuth died while trying to print a report on an 
AT clone because of interference with printer control software. 
</P>

MAGAZINES: FORTUNE TAKES ISSUE WITH FUTURE OF EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Why Johnny Can't Read" is a perennial magazine obsession. Standard procedure 
is to document the abysmal state of education in America, profile a few tragic 
cases, catalogue a litany of official excuses and offer token solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune magazine, in a special spring, 1990, education issue, brushes past the 
problem and cuts to solutions: dozens and dozens of them, billions of dollars 
worth and all of them, naturally, business-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the increasingly popular "kids as commodities" approach to learning 
will not be pleased with Fortune's gung-ho, take-charge, 
kick-it-in-the-seat-of-the-pants attack on education. To which the corporate 
types respond: put up or shut up. 
</P>
<P>
That challenge is not leveled at the usual liberal suspects. Fortune gives 
President George Bush an "A" for rhetoric but an "incomplete" for action, 
urging him to spend a lot more on education. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Gov. George Dukemejian mollycoddled by the advocates of educational 
bean-counting. He fails to make the magazine's "Ten Education Governors" list 
-- by a long shot, presumably, because Fortune ranks California 42nd nationwide 
in high school graduation rate, 50th in teacher-to-student ratio and 31st in 
expenditures per pupil. 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the issue, however, is in praising business for what it has done 
and cajoling it to do more. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* IBM has authorized local managers in all 50 states to help train school 
personnel in districts that have shifted from top-heavy bureaucracies to 
school-based management. 
</P>
<P>
* A Florida insurance company actually built a schoolhouse for its employees' 
kids and melded it into the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
* Mentor programs give executives the chance to help inner city students rise 
above their environmental disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
* Major infusions of cash let corporations exercise a social conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most encouraging ideas are the most simple. In Connecticut, 
teachers have telephone voice-mail systems. Instead of meeting with parents 
once or twice a year, teachers can leave individual messages and the parents 
can respond. In New York, science teachers rent inflatable planetariums, usher 
in their students, then play Carl Sagan to a captive audience. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, education boils down to a chicken-or-egg dilemma: Good students 
come from economically stable families, economic stability depends, more and 
more, on solid education. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune doesn't address underlying issues of social injustice, which may be why 
the package, as instructive as it is, ultimately leaves one vaguely 
unsatisfied. Still, only a cynic will read it and not find a few seeds of hope. 
</P>
<P>
By most indications, the time to start enriching kids is the day they're born. 
So, at one end of the educational spectrum, Fortune holds up the Head Start 
program as a textbook success and urges corporate support. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end, because the current educational assembly line is churning out 
so many work force lemons, 93% of American corporations plan to offer basic 
instruction in math and reading to their employees by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
So the bottom line is this: One way or another, business is going to have to 
get into education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
* While statisticians have for the past decade demonstrated that America's 
public schools are in trouble, other critics have attacked this country's 
institutions of higher education. In the May-June Harvard magazine, Derek Bok, 
the university's president, analyzes the college system. He concludes that 
American universities, while clearly the best, are also flawed. 
</P>
<P>
* Just more than 40 years ago, developer William Levitt looked at an Island 
Trees, N.Y., potato field and saw a new America. His "Levittown" of 
cookie-cutter frame houses came to symbolize oppressive conformity. The 
June-July Memories takes another look at Levittown and decides the place, which 
inspired a sense of community and interdependence, wasn't half bad. 
</P>

Fact Sheet Five is one of those peculiar publications that arrives mysteriously 
in the mail and never quite explains itself. What is this thing? you wonder. If 
you keep browsing, you notice the New York bimonthly reviews hundreds of 
magazines each issue. Where else will you find capsule critiques of Afraid ("A 
fast-growing magazine for the horror writer"), African Farmer ("A magazine 
laying out the many ways in which farmers in Africa are helping to increase 
food production. . . .") and The Agonizer ("A thick journal for Klingons on 
Earth")? And these are just a few of the A-selections. For information, write 
to: Mike Gunderloy, 6 Arizona Ave., Rensselaer, N.Y. 12144.

WHERE I FELL TO EARTH BY PETER CONRAD, POSEIDON, $18.95, 205 PAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Conrad has small apartments in London and New York, lifetime use of six 
rooms at Christ Church in Oxford, where he teaches, and cousin status -- also, 
seemingly, for a lifetime -- at a friend's house in Lisbon. It is four homes, 
but he prefers to call them windows. 
</P>
<P>
One way to know the world is to live in it. Another way is not to live in it. 
Nicholas Roeg made a haunting film called "The Man Who Fell to Earth," about a 
space traveler who landed here by mistake. Through the strangeness he 
experiences, we become friends with our own. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad's title does not come from the film, but his book will recall it. The 
title comes from a remark by his friend's mother who decided, after a few 
visits, that he belonged to the family. Peter, she announced, was meant to fall 
to Earth in Lisbon, only there was a slip, and he landed in Tasmania. 
</P>
<P>
That enormous island is Australia, and so far removed spatially from Europe and 
America that, by Einsteinian analogy, it seems removed in time. Conrad wrote an 
affecting memoir on growing up there. His new book is about being a Tasmanian 
visitor to the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
He was "born" at 20, he tells us, when he walked across Waterloo Bridge from 
the boat-train, holder of a Rhodes Scholarship. London stretched out along the 
river. It was his world from then on; yet he retains a spaceman's 
tentativeness, as if he might be called back any time. Four homes, in a sense, 
are less than one, and just in case: call them windows. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I Fell to Earth" looks through these four portholes, hovering. It is 
travel writing, in a sense; part observation and description, part 
self-examination, part musing. Its suggestion of removal doesn't quite give a 
new perspective on the four places the author has chosen, but it does give them 
an unaccustomed weight or, more accurately, weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't work at all with New York; a tough place, in any case, and one 
about which so much has been written that there is a verbal carapace around it. 
A lot of imaginative intensity is needed to crack it, or a special grace. 
Conrad's writing has some of both, but not enough to do the trick. His 
descriptions of apartment-window exhibitionists, of a tenant found four weeks 
dead, of sex shows in a Hudson River pier, of a Greenwich Village Halloween 
parade, are distancing in a reductive way they become routine New York exotica. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad's account of his London neighborhood is cursory and not particularly 
original. His reflective eye and his reporting eye are set at awkward angles, 
and tend to obstruct each other. He is better with his imagined London than his 
real one; a literary and Antipodean childhood has bestowed such anticipation on 
the place-names that the row houses in Clapham and the gas tanks behind King's 
Cross seem magical. 
</P>
<P>
The passages on Oxford have more life; its eccentricities seem to nourish him. 
Pilfering lettuce from the Senior Common Room to feed a tortoise, he tells of 
the don who removed a bit of breakfast in a napkin each morning; when he died, 
his bureau and desk were full of toast. 
</P>
<P>
He writes of the atmosphere of academic absorption and of the physical oddities 
it produces: 
</P>
<P>
"Men trod the pavement like preying mantises on frail spindly legs. The women 
had disheveled birds' nests for hair. Everyone rode bicycles, with an air of 
elderly childishness. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Here in this moist, stifling labyrinth between two rivers and inside a circle 
of hills, people were turned inside out by thinking. Brains as squashy and 
unarmored and tentacular as jellyfish dodged in front of buses on the High 
Street or furiously pedaled those wobbling bikes." In defense, he soon acquired 
a limp. 
</P>
<P>
The Lisbon sections are limited in scope, but a warmth enters when Conrad 
writes of his childlike comfort with his friend's family. And in a rather 
tentative visit to a tin-wall slum inhabited by African immigrants, his prose 
takes on a disquieting illumination. He describes the brilliant blue with which 
a Guinean couple have painted the walls of their shack; from there, he looks 
down to the Tagus River: 
</P>
<P>
"The water, seen from this close, is brown. The sky in the afternoon haze looks 
livid. Blue is confined to the walls of the lane through the slum, where it 
cheats reality by representing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
It is as if the spaceman had caught a glimpse of his forgotten home; suddenly, 
we are spacemen ourselves.

LEGAL VIEW: DRUNK-DRIVING TEST UNDER ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN, Klein, an attorney and assistant to the publisher of The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By driving an automobile, you agree to be bound by certain legal rules and 
regulations. Most of them are straightforward and even obvious: You must stop 
at red lights, obey traffic officers and drive in only one lane. 
</P>
<P>
Other regulations are more complicated. For example, state law says that anyone 
who drives a motor vehicle has implicitly consented to a chemical test 
(following a lawful arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol). You 
have your choice of three tests -- blood, urine or breath -- but you must 
choose one. If you refuse, your driving license will be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
If you are in the position of having been arrested for drunk driving, all of 
this will be explained to you by the arresting officer, who usually reads from 
a preprinted card. The law was meant to give authorities a "non-physical means 
of coercing an arrestee into submitting to a chemical test," explained one 
court. 
</P>
<P>
This may seem simple enough, but actually this statute -- which is intended to 
persuade an uncooperative suspect to cooperate -- has faced many legal contests 
over the years. The statute has been challenged as a violation of the privilege 
against self-incrimination, as an unreasonable search or seizure, and as a 
denial of equal protection under the law. And it has withstood all the 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1981 California Supreme Court case, one Los Angeles man who had his 
license suspended after refusing to take a chemical test argued that driving 
was a fundamental legal right, comparable to the right of free speech or 
freedom of religion, and that the suspension violated his substantive rights of 
due process. The court didn't buy that argument either. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, courts have been called on to interpret what constitutes a 
refusal to submit to a test. The courts have consistently ruled that a 
"conditional consent" is not good enough. What that means is that if you put 
restrictions on your acceptance, the police can treat it as a refusal, and then 
your license will be suspended. For example, if you state that you'll allow the 
test only if your attorney is present, or if your own personal physician 
conducts the test, that's as good as saying you won't allow the test. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the suspect, a 74-year-old lawyer, insisted on looking at a card 
in his wallet that had information about the accuracy of the three tests. But 
the arresting Highway Patrol officer, in accordance with policy, refused to 
take the handcuffs off the lawyer to allow him to check the card. A court of 
appeal later ruled that the lawyer's actions constituted refusal to submit to 
any test and upheld the suspension of his license. 
</P>
<P>
There was a different result in March in an appellate case involving an Orange 
County man. After his arrest, the man agreed to submit to a blood test, but 
when the technician who was to draw the blood arrived, he "looked like he had 
just gotten out of bed," according to the decision handed down by the appellate 
court. The suspect refused to allow this "tired," "disheveled"-looking 
technician to take his blood unless he first showed some identification. 
</P>
<P>
The court agreed that insisting on identification did not constitute refusal to 
submit to the test and declared the suspension invalid. The suspect was 
entitled to know that the technician was what he purported to be -- "a person 
qualified by statute to draw blood in a proper manner." 
</P>
<P>
"Where that person intends to intrude into the body with a needle, it is not 
only reasonable, but prudent to require identifying information," the court 
noted. On the other hand, the court added it was not suggesting that such 
assurances be given in every case. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, all of these legal distinctions will probably never fit neatly on a 
preprinted card.

THAT WASN'T JUST ANOTHER FISH STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Catch-22: Must a Thriving San Diego Fishing Community Die So More 
Pacific Dolphins May Live?" (May 1): Why doesn't someone ask August Felando, 
head of the American Tunaboat Assn., what he and his family did before the 
advent of the dolphin-killing purse-seine netting (1967-'69)? 
</P>
<P>
There is no reason the tuna fleet can't go back to long-line fishing -- unless, 
of course, the purse-seine fishing has out-fished these areas closer to home 
than Africa. 
</P>
<P>
No, a "thriving San Diego fishing community" need not die -- just wake up to 
today's world and its problems, some of which it created.

BIRTH OF THE BLUES OR SIMPLY A NEW BIRTH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mom-to-be Eileen Heyes ("First Person," April 25) writes that she has had it up 
to here (and out to there) with co-workers volunteering comments on her 
changing size and shape as her due date approaches. As the mother of a 
6-month-old, I commiserate with her -- and I want to warn her: "Hon, it ain't 
gonna get no better." 
</P>
<P>
After the baby is born, you will be fair game for every mom, dad and 
mommy-daddy wanna-be bombarding you with unsolicited advice on how to properly 
feed, burp, change, hold, clothe, bathe and discipline your new little one. 
</P>
<P>
All the above, Eileen, is what your co-workers, generally people who like and 
respect you, will say. I haven't the heart to tell you the kinds of things 
perfect strangers are likely to hiss out at you in the grocery store, but 
they're in the same vein as the horrors-of-childbirth stories people delight in 
telling us when we have only weeks to go.

ONE VOTE FOR THE TERM 'EURO-AMERICAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest Itabari Njeri's article on racial relations ("An L.A. 
Cultural Crucible," May 2). 
</P>
<P>
I noted that the author used the term "Euro-American" when referring to whites 
rather than the inaccurate and possibly derogatory term "Anglo" used often. 
</P>
<P>
While "Euro-American" seemed initially unfamiliar and awkward, as one of 
Greek-American descent I much prefer this term if I must be classified 
racially. Although "Euro-American" still leaves room for misrepresentation 
(white people of Middle-Eastern descent among others are still 
mischaracterized), I feel The Times should encourage the use of this term, 
which more accurately allows for the ethnic diversity among the white residents 
of Los Angeles than does the Latinocentric term "Anglo."

HEMORRHOID ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON, Neil Solomon is the author of Sick &amp; Tired of Being 
Sick &amp; Tired, Wynwood Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I would appreciate any advice you can give me as to how I could 
modify my diet to lessen the problem I have with hemorrhoids. I have already 
made it a point to have a high-fiber cereal for breakfast each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Is there anything else? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Whole grain foods, including bran breakfast cereals, should be a part 
of a diet for anyone bothered with hemorrhoids. Other whole grain foods include 
whole grain bread, brown rice and unprocessed oatmeal. 
</P>
<P>
Fruits and vegetables should also be incorporated into your diet, particularly 
apples and oranges, prunes, carrots and green leafy vegetables. In addition, 
try to have six to seven glasses of water, including fruit juices, each day. On 
the other side, limit your consumption of alcohol and stay away from foods that 
are highly seasoned. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to diet, I suggest you participate in a program of exercise on a 
regular basis. This will improve circulation and muscle tone, and help your 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
For Duane, Lansing, Mich.: Polyunsaturated fats are usually found in vegetables 
and vegetables oils.

ERMA BOMBECK: WANT FAME FOR FLEETING MOMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I was watching a sportscaster the other night giving a live report on TV. Well, 
sort of. Mostly I was distracted by the 15 or 20 kids popping over his 
shoulder, waving their arms and capturing their 15 minutes of fame promised by 
Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing how that little red light on the television camera can activate 
the "star gene" in everyone. 
</P>
<P>
I've watched people who were told to push a button and release a Ping-Pong ball 
with a number on it for the lottery -- nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
They can't resist waving. Game-show contestants who are coached to say two 
words, "Big money," and shut up, look into the camera and add, "I want to say 
hi to my wonderful husband, Leroy, and my three beautiful children. Hi, Mitzi, 
Marksy and Todd." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when the only way you could make it to celebritydom was to 
become a movie star. Not any more. It's getting easier. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a secretary, shred something; a lawyer, steal something; an 
evangelist, cry; or a sports figure, drop off at the Betty Ford clinic for a 
week or two. You can go on fertility drugs and give birth to a litter. . . make 
an embarrassing home video . . . break into the Pentagon's computers . . . or 
break into a celebrity's house. 
</P>
<P>
Author Mifflin Lowe has even written a small handbook on "How to Be a 
Celebrity." He has wonderful advice for celebrity authors: "Insult a major 
religion. Islam would do nicely." 
</P>
<P>
He advises talk-show guests: "As soon as you sit down, mention a city. Any 
city. At least 50 people will applaud. Also mention your family is more 
important than your career. If you want to become a political celebrity and 
you're not a Kennedy, it's probably not worth the effort." 
</P>
<P>
If you're already a celebrity, Lowe suggests you retire early and retire often. 
And every time someone takes your picture, grab the camera and whack 'em across 
the mouth with it. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe tells you how to get there, but he doesn't tell you how to stay on top. In 
New York one day, I was waiting in front of my hotel when a photographer asked 
me to step aside. A limo approached and a dog got out as the photographer shot 
a roll or two of film. I asked the doorman, "Who's that?" He said, "The dog who 
appeared in 'Down and Out in Beverly Hills.' " 
</P>
<P>
Where is that dog now? Hey, baby, two weeks at Betty Ford's clinic and he'll be 
back on top.

Rourke said his agreement with the company gave him approval rights on any

In the beginning, the Renaissance Pleasure Faire was a money-raising event for 
a radio station, and the Renaissance motif was just for fun. Authentic 
recreation of the past was only one part of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not even the most important part. For a lot of faire-goers, the thrill 
seemed to be dressing up in costume and behaving as rowdy, bawdy, haughty 
"lordes and ladyes." A surprising number of people, it developed, were in love 
with the biting tone of voice traditional to the Shakespearean stage. In fact, 
Richard Harris would still seem to be a major role model in our town, to judge 
from the Renaissance Pleasure Faire. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabethanism did not even seem to be obligatory in the early days. It was the 
'60s, and Hobbits and belly-dancers were entirely welcome; the 1967 faire 
sometimes looked as if it would turn into a psychedelic "Be-In." Since those 
days the faire has tried to clean up its motif. Booths have had to meet some 
minimal standards of appropriateness to the Elizabethan period. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, however, quite a few things had become perennial features. It 
wouldn't be a Renaissance Pleasure Faire without them. Above all, this is true 
of the food. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of the faire, the idea was obviously that Elizabethan food 
must have been hearty and rowdy and crude, involving a lot of tossing of bones 
over your shoulder for the wolfhounds to gnaw on. Turkey drumsticks are still a 
big favorite for this reason. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the menu was filled out with folk foods and street foods, mostly 
from England, on the theory that the common people of a country have always 
eaten the same. It's not true, though. You can't have Shepherd's Pye until you 
have potatoes, and the Elizabethans didn't. You can't have ice cream or banger 
sausage until they've been invented. They had toads in Elizabeth I's England, 
but not Toad in the Hole. 
</P>
<P>
Non-British street foods were allowed at the Renaissance Faire too, on the 
questionable theory that 16th-Century London was a cosmopolitan place where 
piroshki and falafel could have been found, somewhere or other. In fact, there 
is no evidence that anybody, anywhere, was making falafel in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
It seems strange that these decisions should have been made ad hoc. They didn't 
have to be. We actually know a great deal about what the Elizabethans ate, from 
several cookbooks written around their time. 
</P>
<P>
We know, for instance, that they ate a lot of highly spiced dishes, heavy with 
cinnamon and ginger in the mincemeat tradition. They ate lots of pies; the 
Cornish pasty is the most authentic Elizabethan tradition at the faire, except 
for the potatoes in it. They ate pease porridge (pea soup), and vegetables 
suited to the English climate such as cabbage and parsnips. Bread and cheese 
and ale were central to their diet. 
</P>
<P>
More and more people are aware of this. Maybe the faire will start insisting on 
more authenticity in the food booths. Maybe people will start looking forward 
to the faire so they can visit the Maumenye Ryall stall, and nobody will look 
for the Churros stall any more. 
</P>
<P>
What am I saying? It wouldn't be a Renaissance Pleasure Faire without churros! 
Forsooth, it wouldn't! 
</P>
<P>
 The Renaissance Pleasure Faire runs through June 10 in San Bernadino.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: CUT SALT INTAKE TO PREVENT HYPERTENSION LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hypertension experts gathered in Long Beach last week to present research that 
proves a link between sodium intake and high blood pressure for all Americans, 
despite claims that the relationship only affects a minority. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Fifth International Interdisciplinary Conference on 
Hypertension in Blacks explained that hypertension, one of the major risk 
factors for coronary heart disease, is a "populationwide problem." It is not 
limited to those who are "salt-sensitive," they said, since all Americans are 
exposed to the same risk factors for hypertension -- smoking, obesity, 
alcoholism, excessive sodium intake and atherosclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
The current approach to reducing hypertension in the United States, said one of 
the leading experts, represents "partial and incomplete strategy," since there 
is no way to test for salt-sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was reported that hypertension is more likely to occur in blacks 
than whites -- high blood pressure affects at least 67% of all black men 
between the ages of 65 and 74 and about 59% of white males the same age -- 
after age 35, at least 80% of the Americans will have a blood pressure that is 
"above optimal," said Dr. Jeremiah Stamler of Northwestern University in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"As seen with cholesterol, high blood pressure is a multifactorial problem, not 
just a black or white problem. It is a population-wide problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If the strategy remains the same and we wait for people to show the clinical 
signs of hypertension, we are guilty of neglect and (exposing people to) excess 
risk (for complications of hypertension)," Stamler said. 
</P>
<P>
Normal blood pressure is 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). This figure 
represents the force of blood as it pushes against the arteries when the heart 
pumps. It is a ratio of systolic over diastolic. 
</P>
<P>
Other than age and race, there are few confirmed causes for high blood 
pressure, which is measured at 140/90 mm Hg. Other risk factors are merely 
suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of accepting that blood pressure will rise with age, Stamler hopes that 
intervention at an early age could eliminate the "abnormal" climb in blood 
pressure, he said. The age-induced increase, he said, is a direct result of a 
lifestyle and it is aggravated by a high sodium intake. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'normal' is for blood pressure to rise with age, but this rise is 
abnormal," said Stamler. "It is complicated by the American lifestyle. Smoking 
and high blood pressure are among the risk factors for heart disease, but high 
blood pressure is pivotal -- it aggravates the other risks. . . . With blood 
pressure, salt is the pivotal one (risk factor)." 
</P>
<P>
The average American consumer gets about 10% of his daily sodium intake from 
the natural salt that occurs in food. About 15% can be attributed to the 
addition of salt during cooking and at the table. The overwhelming majority is 
derived from salt added during processing and manufacturing of food -- about 
75%. 
</P>
<P>
Stamler said, if Americans in general, would cut back on the amount of 
processed food they eat, it could potentially reduce the occurance of 
hypertension in the nation. And he cited recommendations from the National 
Research Council's extensive "Diet and Health Report" and from the American 
Heart Assn. as support. They recommend that consumers reduce sodium intake from 
the current level of consumption to a "safe and adequate" level of 1,100 to 
3,300 milligrams daily. (One teaspoon contains 2,000 mg sodium.) 
</P>
<P>
Americans have a "clear opportunity" to change their life expectancy, Stamler 
said. By making changes in food selection, it could add three and a half years 
to the average life span -- especially for blacks who live six to seven years 
fewer than whites, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been some controversy about this advice. Opponents believe that 
there are other risk factors that are more important than sodium intake. They 
are body weight and alcohol consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The question was raised after interpretation of the population study Intersalt, 
which surveyed and studied 24-hour urine samples of more than 10,000 men and 
women in 32 countries. Intersalt found that sodium intake has a role in raising 
risk for hypertension. It also showed that in some groups body weight and 
alcohol use can be greater predictors of blood pressure status than sodium 
intake. 
</P>
<P>
But Stamler emphasized the salt component is the most influential. He said that 
the data clearly indicates that eating less salt was of benefit: In all 
populations, the higher the sodium intake, the greater the increase in blood 
pressure with age. 
</P>
<P>
From this, he and his colleagues concluded that a lifetime of reduced salt 
intake, coupled with weight maintenance and conservative alcohol consumption, 
could lessen a person's chances of developing high blood pressure in old age. 
</P>
<P>
"What we learned from Intersalt," said Dr. Clarence E. Grim, of the Charles 
Drew Medical Center, Los Angeles, "is that in societies that eat very little 
salt, there is very little hypertension. Salt is the most critical indicator in 
blood pressure. We are currently eating 150 times what what we need."

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: PHO 79: GOOD MORNINGS IN VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The perfect breakfast is hard to find. Soul food is too fattening, diner food 
too bland, Japanese pickles just too weird before noon. If you like noodles, 
you might think Pho 79 serves the perfect breakfast, light, tasty and just 
exotic enough, inexpensive and filled with vitamins: beef soup. There's sweet, 
freshly squeezed orange juice -- also lemonade and the tropical fruit guanabana 
-- and soy milk for the lactophobe. The strong, dark-roasted coffee, dripped at 
table in individual stainless-steel French filters, is among the best anywhere. 
In an area, Chinatown, thick with Vietnamese noodle shops, Pho 79 serves the 
best, as its precursor did in Saigon before the fall, and as its cousin Pho 79s 
do in Westminster and Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The menu might look confusing at first, until you realize that most of the 
dishes are variations on one of two or three themes. As in most Vietnamese 
noodle shops, the best dish is listed first: pho (pronounced something like 
"far") dac biet, slices of brisket, tendon, tripe and rare beef submerged with 
slippery rice noodles in a beef broth fragrant with garlic and cinnamon, onion 
and herbs. (If you hesitate more than an instant when ordering, a waiter may 
bark "Number One?" at you.) Even before 10 in the morning, two-thirds of the 
people here are slurping these giant bowls of noodles. 
</P>
<P>
No two people eat pho the same way. You can squeeze a little lime juice or 
squirt some chile or hoisin sauce into the soup, or mix in bean sprouts, sliced 
hot chiles and leaves of fresh Vietnamese basil from a plate of herbs, making 
the dish something of a salad. The soup, tasty enough on its own, becomes 
obscenely good. If you order the variation called pho tai, noodles with rare 
beef, you can ask for the beef on the side; you dip the slices of raw beef in 
hot soup until they turn opaque, then dip them into a special chile paste. 
Other versions of pho include higher or lower proportions of brisket or tripe, 
or include beef meatballs that are gamy with Vietnam's ubiquitous fish sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everything at Pho 79 that isn't beef soup has something to do, somehow, 
with the combination of cool rice noodles and garlicky, wonderful barbecued 
pork. If you don't like noodles, you'll have to make do with pork chops. With 
bun cha, the grilled bits of pork are marinated in nuoc cham, the clear, sweet 
garlic-fish sauce that is to Vietnamese cooking what soy sauce is to Chinese. 
These bits come in one dish, garnished with ground peanuts and fried chips of 
garlic. Plain vermicelli comes in another, crisp romaine lettuce in a third. 
The idea, a do-it-yourself sort of thing, is to roll it all up into bundles of 
food, like little noodle-filled burritos wrapped in green, then dip them in 
nuoc cham. 
</P>
<P>
Bun thit nuong is more or less the same thing, except the lettuce and the pork 
are on top of the noodles in a bowl (you have to pour the nuoc cham on 
yourself); bun tom thit nuong throws in a couple of charbroiled shrimp; bun 
thit nuong cha gio includes some chopped up Vietnamese spring rolls tossed 
right in there with the noodles; bun bao, not as delicious, substitutes sauteed 
beef. For a change, you can have the terrific fresh egg rolls called goi cuon, 
which are our old friends pork, shrimp, lettuce and vermicelli all wrapped up 
in a sheet of edible rice paper, ready to dip in the chile-spiked hoisin sauce 
called nuoc leo. 
</P>
<P>
The fried spring rolls, cha gio, stuffed with thin noodles and a crab and pork 
forcemeat, come seven to an order, hotly spiced with black pepper. You wrap the 
crisp dumplings with marinated carrots in leaves of romaine as you do the bun 
cha -- during the summer there are sometimes four or five different herbs to 
wrap in with them, mint, cilantro and two or three kinds of fresh basil -- and 
dip it in yet another bowl of nuoc cham. (Without fail, your party will end up 
with several bowls of fish sauce apiece and enough greenery to feed a gerbil 
for a year.) 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Pho 79 does have a few drawbacks. On weekend mornings, you may have 
to wait for as long as five minutes. They haven't changed their one Vietnamese 
easy-listening tape since they opened a few years ago, and if you go every 
week, you get to know the songs pretty well. And they're invariably closed the 
one day in the middle of the week you decide to carpool from downtown for 
lunch. Call ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Pho 79, 727 N. Broadway, Suite 120, Chinatown. (213) 625-7026. Open 
Thursday-Tuesday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Validated parking. Cash only. Beer and wine. 
Lunch or dinner for two, food only, $7-$12.

little lime, some squirt chile sauce into the soup, others mix in bean sprouts,

MICROWAVE: INGREDIENT CHANGES, HINTS FOR 'BAKING' BETTER MUFFINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who claim muffins can't be microwaved have clearly used the wrong 
recipe. Conventional recipes won't work because microwaves affect foods in 
different, often unpredictable, ways and adjustments must be made. 
</P>
<P>
Muffins, for example, rise faster and higher in a microwave than in a 
conventional oven, so you must reduce the baking powder by about one-third and 
fill the muffin pan cups no more than half full. 
</P>
<P>
The recipes that follow have been especially developed for the microwave, and 
if you follow them to the letter you should produce perfect muffins every time. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, here are a couple of tips that will serve you well whenever you "bake 
" or reheat muffins by microwave. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the way to microwave just a few muffins at a time: Line one to six 
custard cups (five-ounce size) with double thickness of paper liners. Half fill 
each with muffin batter and arrange two inches apart, three cups in a triangle 
and four or more in a circle. Microwave as directed. If you set three or more 
cups on a plate, they'll be easier to rearrange, rotate and lift in and out of 
the oven. 
</P>
<P>
To reheat muffins, wrap room-temperature muffins in paper towels and microwave 
on MEDIUM (50% power), allowing 15 to 20 seconds per muffin. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Ray Cooper is a "good ol' boy." I've known him for years. We've gone quail 
hunting in Arkansas, steelhead fishing on the Rogue River in southern Oregon 
and we've fished the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
You may know him too. He does a fishing program called "Crooked Creek" Saturday 
mornings on ESPN. He does a little cooking on the show from time to time, and 
he's a pretty good cook. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Cooper was head of the National Trout Farmers Assn. He knows a 
good bit about farm-raised trout. Now he's into smoking them. He has an 
operation called White River Foods Inc. on the White River in northern 
Arkansas, where he smokes farm-raised trout over applewood. It's delicious. 
</P>
<P>
I visited Cooper in Arkansas not long ago, and we tasted smoked trout in a 
variety of ways. He even taught me how to smoke my own in my covered cooker in 
the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
SMOKED TROUT 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups salt 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Dissolve salt in 1 gallon water. Place fish in salt water and marinate in 
refrigerator 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Remove trout, rinse and dry thoroughly. Soak wood chips in remaining 1/2 gallon 
fresh water several hours or overnight. Refrigerate fish while soaking chips. 
</P>
<P>
Bring covered grill (charcoal, gas or electric) to low heat. Cover heated coals 
with 1/3 hickory chips. 
</P>
<P>
Place fish, skin-side down, on well-greased grill about 4 to 6 inches from 
coals. Close grill hood and open vent to circulate smoke. Add additional wood 
chips as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke trout at 105 to 175 degrees approximately 1 hour or at 200 degrees 30 to 
40 minutes. Trout is done when cut surface is golden brown and flakes easily 
with fork. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>

Photo, HAUTE POOLSIDE SNACKS -- When the National Kidney Foundation of Southern 
California puts on an event called "The Great Chefs of L.A.," L.A.'s great 
chefs respond. Twenty restaurants -- Tulipe, Chez Melange, Joss, Orleans, City 
and Champagne, to name just a few -- served up an astonishing array of 
delicacies. Siegfried Shafner of Le Bel Age offered beggar's purses -- herbed 
crepes filled with salmon, lobster salad and quail eggs. Ma Be chef, Eric 
Cunin, served rillettes of salmon; goat cheese flan with roasted pepper coulis 
and tomato-flavored pasta pillows with anchovy, garlic and basil. The Westwood 
Marquis hosted the event; from their kitchens came vitello citronato -- veal 
marinated in four types of citrus and roasted. Roy Yamaguchi, honorary chef for 
the benefit, flew in from his Honolulu restaurant to prepare his signature 
grilled chicken with chutney and Cabernet coconut butter sauce. Here he is seen 
putting the finishing touches on his other offering, shrimp shui mai. Scott

THE GOOD GUY VS. BAD GUYS IN A DIET THAT REDUCES THE RISK OF DISEASE; 
</P>
<P>
CANCER: IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR HOW, OR IF, THE BODY USES VITAMINS AND FIBER TO 
PREVENT DISEASE. SOME STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE REAL HEROES ARE AS-YET 
UNIDENTIFIED TRACE ELEMENTS IN THE HIGH-FIBER FOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Each time the refrigerator door is opened, the fight begins. It's a tug of war: 
Will you reach for nutrient-empty foods to quell your hunger, or for the foods 
that will help your body ward off disease? 
</P>
<P>
"You really can't eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables without decreasing 
your fats and calories and increasing your fiber," says Dr. Daniel Nixon, vice 
president for professional education at the American Cancer Society's Atlanta 
headquarters. "I think there's a great deal of hope that we can decrease our 
cancer rates by decreasing our caloric intake," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Some groups have suggested that we should eat five servings of fruits or 
vegetables a day. Those are just broad guidelines," he says. "More primitive 
societies eat more fiber, and epidemiologists tell us that because they eat a 
more fiber-rich diet, they have less cancer of the colon, for example." 
</P>
<P>
How the body uses fiber and vitamins to prevent cancer isn't clear, he says. In 
fact, it isn't certain that the fiber or the vitamins themselves are the agents 
of prevention; some studies suggest that the good guys are as-yet unidentified 
trace elements in the high-fiber foods. There may be a helpful compound "riding 
along with the beta-carotene" in some vegetables, he says; then again, the 
beta-carotene itself may be the good guy. 
</P>
<P>
What researchers say is nearly certain is that the "bad guys" are fats. "Since 
the Industrial Revolution, we have been gorging ourselves on animal fat." 
Overindulgence in fat has a direct effect on health and leads to obesity. The 
American Cancer Society recommends replacing high-fat foods in the diet with 
low-calorie, fresh vegetables and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean the diet should be meatless. The society recommends a shift 
to leaner meats, poultry and fish and away from fried or greasy foods, and 
moderation in the consumption of fats. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon adds an important note: The American Cancer Society guidelines are 
intended for adults, not babies and children. Youngsters have different dietary 
needs and parents should consult a pediatrician for advice about meeting a 
child's nutritional requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The society says "select your rations rationally": strawberries, peaches, 
carrots, spinach and other Vitamin A-rich foods; oranges, tomatoes, peppers, 
grapefruit and other Vitamin C-rich foods; cruciferous vegetables such as 
broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage; lean meats, chicken and fish; 
low-fat dairy products; high-fiber grains, fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Turning these ingredients into delicious, nutritious meals is not hard, says 
Chef Michael Baskette, director of faculty at the Baltimore International 
Culinary College. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our job to help guide the professionals going into the industry so that 
when the consumer says, 'I like this entree, but I'm cutting back on fat,' the 
chef can adapt the recipe," he says. "There will always be those restaurants 
that have rich foods, but a whole new philosophy is emerging in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
"If you take away the butter and fats, you may think you are giving up flavor, 
but you won't," he says. "Butter and fat coat your taste; it's hiding the true 
flavor of the meat and vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
Baskette recommends treating butter and flavored oils as seasonings, not bases 
or essentials for a dish. He uses fresh herbs and light marinades to enhance 
the flavors of lean meats. Extra ginger and fresh garlic, and a mere droplet or 
two of sesame oil, for example, will boost the taste of stir-fried vegetables 
and chicken, he says. Also, "we don't always think of the root vegetables, such 
as turnips, which can be added to stews to add flavor." 
</P>
<P>
The following recipe is from the Baltimore International Culinary College, 
along with two others from "The American Cancer Society Cookbook" by Anne 
Lindsay in consultation with Diane J. Fink, M.D. (William Morrow, 1988: 
$17.95). 
</P>
<P>
BEEF AND VEGETABLE STIR-FRY 
</P>
<P>
1 cup fresh broccoli florets 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons peanut oil, about 
</P>
<P>
1 pound flank or sirloin steak, cut in 3/4-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
1/2 small onion, cut in 1/4-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
2 small green peppers, cut in 1/4-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
2 ounces unsalted peanuts, optional 
</P>
<P>
1 cup diced carrot 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Cooked brown rice 
</P>
<P>
Steam broccoli until tender-crisp. Heat oil (as needed) in large skillet or wok 
over high heat. Add beef and stir-fry quickly until lightly browned. Add onion, 
green peppers and carrot. Stir-fry until onion is translucent. Add broccoli. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve over hot cooked brown rice. Makes 4 
to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To add more flavor, stir-fry beef with minced garlic and/or ginger and 
add few drops sesame oil at end. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructions are provided for cooking this dish in microwave or conventional 
oven. Use fresh fillets of red snapper, perch, sole, cod, flounder, haddock or 
monkfish. Frozen fish can be substituted. This dish is an excellent provider of 
vitamins A and C, niacin and phosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
FILLETS PROVENCAL 
</P>
<P>
1 (16-ounce) can whole tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
1 pound fish fillets 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fine fresh bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons finely chopped green onions (including tops) 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
Drain tomatoes and coarsely chop. In microwave-safe dish just large enough to 
hold fillets in single layer, spoon half of tomatoes. Season fillets to taste 
with salt and pepper. Arrange on top of tomatoes and top with remaining 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
In small bowl, combine parsley, bread crumbs, green onions, melted butter and 
garlic. Sprinkle mixture over fish. 
</P>
<P>
Cover loosely with wax paper. Microwave on HIGH 9 to 12 minutes or until fish 
is opaque. Let stand 3 minutes before serving. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To cook in conventional oven, bake fish in 450-degree oven, 20 minutes 
for fresh fillets, 40 minutes for frozen, or until fish is opaque or flakes 
easily with fork. 
</P>
<P>
 This vegetable dish is high in vitamins A and C and also provides some fiber.

DISTRICT PICKS FIRST LATINO SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>

<P>
The son of migrant farm workers this week became the first Latino to head the 
Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District when the board unanimously voted to 
offer him a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Aguilar, 50, an associate superintendent for the Richmond Unified School 
District near San Francisco, will be paid an annual salary of $92,000 to run 
the district that has 18,000 students, more than half of them Latino. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in El Paso, Tex., but grew up in Central California, where his 
parents were migrant farm workers. He has a bachelor's degree in economics and 
education from Cal State Fresno. He earned a master's degree in instruction and 
administration at San Jose State University and a doctorate in curriculum and 
administration from the University of Pacific in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Salvador Ambriz said Aguilar's ethnic heritage was 
"definitely a contributing factor in his selection. He will serve as a role 
model for (Latino) students." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said that his ability to speak Spanish is an asset but that he will not 
restrict his efforts just to the Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be going into the living rooms to speak with parents. I will speak to 
the leadership of the PTA. I will meet with key business, government and 
education leaders. I want to be a good listener. I want their ideas for making 
this a better district," Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
He promised to work to raise test scores in the district and to prevent 
students from dropping out of school. 
</P>
<P>
He said one issue he intends to raise is whether there should be middle schools 
in the district. The district closed seven middle schools more than a decade 
ago because of declining enrollment. "The parents and community people I have 
talked to so far all say they want middle schools. We need to focus on that," 
Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
A plan to reopen middle schools was killed by the Board of Education in 1988. 
Uncertainties over financing led to the decision. The board had planned to seek 
voter approval of a special property tax to help pay for the middle-school 
plan, but some members said they believed the ballot measure would fail and the 
matter was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said he applied for the Norwalk-La Mirada job because it is "an 
opportunity and challenge for professional growth." 
</P>
<P>
He has been a teacher, counselor, administrator and superintendent, all in 
Central and Northern California, in his more than 28 years as an educator. He 
was superintendent for the 1,800-student Earlimart Elementary School District 
before going to Richmond in 1987 as an associate superintendent with an $81,000 
annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
While the Richmond district is larger, with 31,000 students, there are 
similarities between the two districts. Both urban districts serve more than 
one city and have very poor sections as well as very affluent communities, 
Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond is currently attempting to offset a $6.4-million deficit in a 
$133-million budget for the 1989-90 school year. The district is considering 
issuing bonds to try to erase the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwalk-La Mirada district is considering tentative cuts of $1.4 million to 
balance a $67 million budget for the 1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond district has received attention for its program in which parents 
have the freedom to choose other schools within the system if they are 
dissatisfied with the one in their neighborhood. Aguilar said he had no plans 
to propose such a program in the Norwalk-La Mirada district. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar replaces Bruce C. Newlin, who resigned in June, 1989, to become 
superintendent of the Ceres unified system in Central California. Newlin left 
the district after 11 years. Newlin said he wanted to work in a smaller, rural 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar and his wife Gloria have two sons, Anthony, 28, and Robert, 26.

CITY APPROVES ISSUING BONDS TO REINFORCE OLD BUILDINGS

<P>
Building owners facing wallet-thinning repair bills to comply with local 
earthquake standards got a little help from the city this week. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved a proposal to create a special assessment district 
under which the city would issue bonds to provide financing for seismic repairs 
required under city law. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners in need of money to pay for the earthquake repairs would join 
the assessment district and pay both the interest and principal on the bonds, 
in much the same way as they would pay off a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a similar bond issue to help the residents of two 
downtown condominium buildings plagued by extensive structural flaws. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1991 deadline for earthquake reinforcement fast approaching, there are 
still about 564 buildings in the city that need to be strengthened. The costs 
of bringing the pre-1934 structures into compliance with the city's strict 
earthquake standards have been a major concern to owners, who will be told to 
demolish their buildings if they fail to reinforce them. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 property owners facing repair costs totaling more than $20 
million have indicated their interest in joining an assessment district, 
according to city officials, who held two public meetings on the matter last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping people would come up with financing without the city, but that 
hasn't really happened very much," remarked Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, 
who represents the downtown district where a number of older apartment 
buildings need earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
In both bond issues, the city is merely acting as an agent and would not be 
responsible for the bond debt. Property owners will have to list their 
buildings or condominium units as security on the bonds and make regular 
payments. Interest rates are expected to be about the same as those for a 
conventional mortgage. The earthquake bond will be repaid over a 20- to 30-year 
period, and the condominium bond, expected to be about $1 million, will have a 
term of five to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The city's earthquake ordinance requires that all non-wooden buildings 
constructed before 1934 be reinforced to withstand earthquakes. Structures 
built after the destructive, 1933 earthquake in Long Beach are not included 
because they had to meet stricter codes than those built earlier.

The Oceangate and Golden Gate condominium complexes in the 700 block of West 
4th Street both need shoring as a result of design flaws that left the 
buildings structurally unsound. The buildings were approved by city inspectors, 
but the structural problems were not discovered until after residents moved in 
and started noticing cracks in the walls, and doors that would not close 
properly.

COUNCIL SPLITS 3-2 IN VOTING TRASH HAULER A 49% RATE HIKE

<P>
It was the first meeting after a contentious election and it did not take long 
for the old guard and the newcomers on the City Council to butt heads. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime council members Thomas E. Jackson, Jack W. Parks and William P. 
Cunningham banded together to grant the city's commercial trash hauler a 49% 
rate increase despite the objections of Councilmen Luis Hernandez and Raul 
Perez. The rate increase does not affect residential trash service, which is 
provided by another company. 
</P>
<P>
While campaigning during last month's election, Hernandez repeatedly criticized 
Jackson, Parks and Cunningham for awarding the lucrative commercial garbage 
contract to the well-connected owner of H. P. Disposal without seeking bids 
from competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Now the three councilmen pushed through a sizable rate increase, and Hernandez 
spoke out about the way the contract was awarded in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a done deal before it was (voted) on," Hernandez said, referring to the 
1988 contract. "I totally oppose this method of voting for the disposal 
contract." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who negotiated the contract with the trash company, said H. P. 
Disposal has provided good service and that Hernandez was on a witch hunt. 
"Your bias is showing, Mr. Hernandez," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he would vote for the 49% rate increase if it were shown that 
the company's operating expenses had risen accordingly. "I don't see anything 
that substantiates a 49% increase," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez also questioned the propriety of such a large increase. 
</P>
<P>
In requesting the rate increase, H. P. Disposal submitted documents showing 
that the cost of using area landfills had risen, as had health insurance costs 
for the firm's employees. 
</P>
<P>
But H. P. Disposal officials did not provide any information on how the firm's 
overall operating expenses had increased, said Donald L. Jeffers, city chief 
administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the exact" increase in H. P. Disposal's operating expenses, 
Jackson said. "There was enough (information) to justify that increase." 
</P>
<P>
Effective July 1, H. P. Disposal will charge the city's businesses $83.26 a 
month to empty a three-cubic-yard trash bin once a month. The current charge is 
$55.88. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of seven area cities indicates that the new charges will be about 
average, according to a city report. For example, Compton charges $85 a month 
for similar service, while Lynwood charges $78.71. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with H. P. Disposal generated controversy from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene C. Fresch, a former Las Vegas casino operator, founded H. P. Disposal in 
May, 1988. He was awarded Huntington Park's commercial garbage contract less 
than a month later. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc., a Canadian firm, still had three years remaining on 
a five-year contract at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and other city officials had secretly negotiated for months with 
Fresch. Jackson said Laidlaw's service was poor and its contract needed to be 
terminated. The new contract would enable the city to improve service and 
collect a franchise fee for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
But word of the contract leaked and three other trash firms submitted informal 
proposals that might have generated larger franchise fees for Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
H. P. Disposal agreed to pay the city a 5% annual franchise fee -- about 
$75,000 -- with an advance payment of $300,000. One of the competing firms 
offered a 12% franchise fee with a $1 million advance. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, Parks and Cunningham approved the contract with H. P. Disposal. Former 
Councilmen Herbert A. Hennes Jr. and Jim Roberts voted against it, saying the 
city should follow up on the informal proposal from the other firms. 
</P>
<P>
State law allows cities to award such contracts without competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he favored H. P. Disposal because he knew Fresch and trusted that 
his new firm would provide top-notch service. H. P. Disposal had no equipment 
when it won the contract. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contended that Jackson's personal friendship with Fresch's son, 
Curtis, paved the way and may have deprived the city of additional revenue. 
Curtis Fresch manages the Huntington Park Casino, which provides the city with 
about $500,000 in revenue annually. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Jeffers said the service provided by H. P. Disposal "has 
been most satisfactory and complaints to my office have been non-existent." 
</P>
<P>
After their heated exchange, Jackson and Hernandez moved to close any rifts 
opened at their first meeting as council colleagues. They pledged to work 
together even if they disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Before Hernandez and Perez, there had not been a new council member since 
Cunningham took his seat in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"This is new and strange to us," Jackson said.

WHITTIER PUTS BUILDINGS ON HOLD; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL TO EXAMINE GROWTH ISSUE BEFORE ALLOWING MORE STRIP MALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Whittier City Council approved a 45-day moratorium on permits for new, 
small retail developments and apartment buildings while it examines standards 
that could determine the course of future growth in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium on retail developments of one acre or less is aimed at strip 
malls -- those corner shopping plazas noted for doughnuts, dry cleaning, fast 
food, video rentals and manicures. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody needs these things anymore," Council member Helen Rahder said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to have a few good (developments) than 100 sleazy things," she 
said, prompting applause from dozens of supporters at the Tuesday night council 
meeting. Rahder and Bob Henderson, the council's newest members, ran for office 
on a platform of controlled growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the moratorium," Henderson said, "is not to stop building but 
to set standards." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to allow free enterprise," Council member Myron Claxton countered. 
"We can't restrict that." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how what you want can be done in 45 days," said council member 
Robert Woehrmann, who, like the other incumbents, worries that limits on 
development could stifle Whittier's growth. 
</P>
<P>
Even a moratorium, he said, "would still make an impact on the ownership and 
development community." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he said it is not the council's business to determine how many pizza 
parlors could open in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their misgivings, the other council members joined Rahder and Henderson 
in passing the moratorium unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a similar freeze on the building of apartments. 
Henderson said developers should build apartments that blend with established 
neighborhoods rather than buildings that "might as well be a warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
The new standards are likely to permit fewer apartments per parcel and require 
developers to provide more parking, landscaping and open space. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Thomas Mauk said drafting comprehensive guidelines for new 
apartments would take at least three months. Under city law, a moratorium can 
last only as long as 45 days without a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Setting standards for apartments does not promise to be nearly as contentious 
as the struggle to control the future of retail development, in particular the 
proliferation of strip malls. 
</P>
<P>
One development that will be placed on immediate hold is a proposed Blockbuster 
Video store at the corner of a strip mall at Beverly and Norwalk boulevards. 
The congested intersection already contains three small shopping plazas and is 
next to a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us would look at that development with pride," Henderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because such plazas occupy less than an acre, they escape review processes in 
place for larger developments. Henderson said another strip mall, at Hadley 
Street and Milton Avenue, might never have survived such a review. He noted 
that the narrow parking lot contained far too few parking spaces for the number 
of customers the tenants would need to remain in business. 
</P>
<P>
"That place is a piece of work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are sliding through that weren't meant to be," Rahder said. "With so 
many vacant lots since the earthquake, there's a chance of something nasty 
going in." 
</P>
<P>
Since the October, 1987, earthquake and aftershock, there have been 156 
residential demolitions, at least 65 directly attributable to quake damage, 
according to planning department records. Wreckers also knocked down 138 
commercial buildings. Of these demolitions, 68 became necessary because of 
quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, owners tore down buildings rather than face the high cost of 
repair. And some developers also took advantage of emergency demolition 
measures to clear off structures. 
</P>
<P>
Rahder said the strip malls endanger the city's own rehabilitation master plan 
because they saturate the market with retail office space and compete with 
downtown areas that the council seeks to revitalize. "We're biting off our nose 
to spite our face," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A leading mini-mall developer sees it differently. "I'm curious why a city that 
has had an earthquake would not want to rebuild its tax base," said Samuel 
Bachner, the president of the Los Angeles-based La Mancha Development. 
</P>
<P>
His company specializes in building small shopping plazas, to the amount of 
$200 to $300 million a year, Bachner said. "I think it's going to continue to 
grow as California grows. People have a need for goods and services." 
</P>
<P>
Bachner said the malls provide jobs, conveniences, affordable retail space and 
even identity to an area. He sees no problem with quality control. "They all 
get what they ask for," he said.

MONTEBELLO RETAIL CENTER APPROVED; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: A 20-ACRE PROJECT IS PLANNED ON ONCE-OIL-RICH TERRAIN. THE CITY 
EXPECTS TO REAP ABOUT $1.1 MILLION A YEAR IN TAXES, PLUS ABOUT 900 NEW JOBS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 2 1/2 years of negotiations, the Montebello Community 
Redevelopment Agency approved two agreements Tuesday that clear the way for 
building a commercial center that was envisioned by city leaders almost 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Agency members, who also sit on the City Council, voted 3 to 2 to allow 
Montebello Commercial Properties to build a 20-acre retail center on the 
once-oil-rich terrain of Montebello Hills. The agency also signed an agreement 
to buy 10 acres on the same parcel from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. to build an auto 
center. 
</P>
<P>
With the approval, Montebello residents are virtually assured that by the end 
of next year they will get something for which they have long been clamoring: a 
theater, a nice restaurant and more places to shop. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really happy," City Councilman Art Payan said. "We got everything 
signed, and we are on our way. It's exciting to think that in little more than 
a year we will have a theater and another major shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
Economic development director Linda Payan said the city also expects to reap 
about $1.1 million a year in sales and property taxes from both the commercial 
center and the auto park. About 900 new jobs will be created, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-acre development project is immediately southwest of Montebello Town 
Center, a mall that opened about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Payan said the developer's preliminary plans call for a retail center of 
three fast-food outlets, one "upscale" restaurant, a movie theater with eight 
to 10 screens, a Sears shopping center and a toy store. 
</P>
<P>
The city is trying to woo at least two car dealers to the adjoining 10-acre 
parcel. Art Payan said an agreement with a developer may be signed within 90 
days to bring in dealers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the city redevelopment agency will pay about $2 
million to grade the 30 acres, plus about $1.5 million for street signals, 
roads and other public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Agency members Ed Pizzorno and Bill Molinari voted against the agreements, 
saying they disapprove of the developer's plan to build the fast-food outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents have been talking about a 'restaurant row' idea, where there is a 
row of steak and seafood houses," Pizzorno said. "We're getting three 
drive-through hamburger stands. I just think people can go to McDonald's 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Pizzorno said he does not think the city is getting a fair return on its 
investment because the developer plans to build the fast-food outlets on land 
that could have been used to bring in more car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt if we were going to subsidize the rich, we better get an awful 
lot," Pizzorno said. "I don't feel we got enough back." 
</P>
<P>
Though some combination of auto park and commercial center was planned for 
Montebello Hills in 1973, it has taken a great deal of work in the last few 
years to get the project going, Planning Director Paul Deibel said. 
</P>
<P>
The entire site was part of the Montebello Oil Field owned by Chevron U.S.A. In 
1975, the city designated the site and the surrounding 450 acres of oil field 
as part of its redevelopment area. Little else was done until the mid-1980s, 
when city officials began corresponding with state and local officials about 
their plans to develop the area. 
</P>
<P>
Because the commercial center will be built on an old oil field and is next to 
a Monterey Park landfill that once accepted hazardous liquid waste, Deibel 
said, the environmental impact report led to one of the longest delays in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, there are several problems that could affect the 
commercial center and its surrounding area. Most can be solved, the report 
stated, but air quality will be adversely affected because of the increased 
traffic. Also, the proximity of the commercial center to the landfill means 
that bad odors may occasionally waft over the center. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the two concerns listed in the report, the City Council passed a 
resolution in September stating that because of increased revenues and jobs, it 
is best for the city to go ahead with the project. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, after 2 1/2 years of talks, the redevelopment agency signed a 
preliminary agreement with Montebello Commercial Properties Inc., a joint 
venture of Chevron Land &amp; Development and the Alexander Haagen Co., to 
develop a 15-acre retail center. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency also offered $6.5 million to Chevron U.S.A. for 15 
more acres on the same parcel of land and signed an agreement with a local 
Chevrolet dealer to build the auto park. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the redevelopment agency revised the agreements because Montebello 
Commercial Properties said it wants to bring in a Sears store and needs more 
land, and the Chevrolet dealer said he could not find enough dealerships for an 
auto center. 
</P>
<P>
The agency agreed to lop off five acres from the auto park and give it to the 
commercial center. The price of the land that the redevelopment agency will buy 
from Chevron U.S.A. for the auto center dropped to $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
MORE SHOPPING: After years in the planning, a new shopping center and theater 
will be built in the Montebello Hills. Some city leaders hail the project, but 
others say it is not enough.

LAKEWOOD TO CURB NOISE IN JET TESTS; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: THE ROAR FROM DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT'S ENGINE TESTS HAS ENGULFED THE 
SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE CITY. THE FIRM SAYS IT COMPLIES WITH LONG BEACH'S NOISE 
ORDINANCE.

<P>
The City Council Tuesday unanimously decided to draft a noise ordinance aimed 
at curbing the roar from Douglas Aircraft's jet engine testing, which for years 
has engulfed the southwest corner of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel there are ways to mitigate (the noise) that they are not doing just 
because it is not convenient," Councilman Larry Van Nostran said after the 
council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they do not know what provisions will be included in the 
noise ordinance or when it will be completed by City Atty. John S. Todd. 
However, they said, they are firm about wanting to force Douglas to protect the 
neighborhood around the test site, at the north end of the Long Beach Airport 
along Carson Street at the intersection of Paramount Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and business owners have complained about what they describe as 
deafening noise pollution that causes blood pressure to soar and buildings to 
vibrate whenever Douglas starts testing. At nearby Lakewood County Golf Course, 
the testing position of the planes sends noise and exhaust directly over the 
greens. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're playing golf on that course, which I do," Van Nostran said, "that 
noise is so deafening." 
</P>
<P>
Donald N. Hanson, manager of public relations for Douglas, said it would be 
"inappropriate" to comment on the City Council's action because he has no idea 
what will be contained in the noise ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson pointed out, however, that the company does comply with Long Beach's 
noise ordinance, which allows Douglas to test engines between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. 
on weekdays. No testing is allowed before 9 a.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson also pointed out that aircraft engines today are quieter than in the 
past. "We have done a lot as an industry and the engine-makers have done a lot 
to produce quieter engines," he said. "That has been very effective." 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials said they worry that Douglas will begin testing its newest 
military plane, the C-17, and that its engines will be noisier than the 
domestic passenger planes now tested. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson said, however, that C-17 testing will be conducted elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Douglas plant sprawls at the runways of the Long Beach Airport. Built in 
1940 as the nation was gearing up for World War II, the plant straddles the 
border between Lakewood and Long Beach and employs about 35,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the plant, which is in a peak production schedule with a backlog of 
domestic and military aircraft orders to fill, lies within the Long Beach city 
limits. However, the small parcel on which the engines are tested is within 
Lakewood's municipal boundary. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach gets all the money and Lakewood gets all the noise," Van Nostran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Lakewood hired a consultant, Thomas W. Fitzwater of Michael 
Brandman Associates in Santa Ana, to recommend how Lakewood could make Douglas 
a quieter neighbor. The consultant documented that the noise created by the 
engine tests averages 10.6 decibels higher than normal background noise in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council's decision to draft a noise ordinance goes beyond 
recommendations that the consultant presented Tuesday night. His major 
recommendation was that the city support a plan by the Long Beach Airport to 
build a "hush house," a building in which airport operators, including Douglas, 
could test engines. 
</P>
<P>
Such a facility, which would have to be approved by the Long Beach City Council 
during its budget deliberations next month, would cost $3.2 million. Most of 
the money -- $2.5 million -- would come from the Federal Aviation 
Administration, if the federal agency agrees that the new facility is needed. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant recommended that both Lakewood and Signal Hill join with Long 
Beach in lobbying the federal government for the money. 
</P>
<P>
However, according to Chuck Ebner, Lakewood's community development and 
planning director, it would be at least three years before a hush house could 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the potential for a new facility," Councilman Wayne Piercy said after 
the council meeting, "but we have no assurance of when it's going to be done. 
For the short term, we need to do whatever can be done. Long term, we support 
construction of this hush house." 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to help Long Beach lobby the federal government for hush 
house money. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, before the facility is built, the consultant's report said, 
the noise problem could be mitigated if Douglas would move its new planes out 
to an engine run-up area in the center of the airport. The present test site is 
alongside Carson Street, the only strip of land separating the test area from 
the golf course and the rest of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
According to the consultant's report, the run-up area is large enough for 
Douglas' new aircraft. If the company agreed to use the area, the report said, 
noise from the engine tests would be reduced in the neighborhood from its 
current high of 10.6 decibels above normal background noise to about 3 or 4 
decibels above background noise. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have to test them in the place and the way they do," Piercy said. 
"We want to work with them as good neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
However, Piercy said, he and other city officials spoke with Douglas 
representatives last year about the noise problem and were told that the 
company did not want to use the run-up area because it was not convenient. 
</P>
<P>
Piercy said city officials were "kind of surprised" to find that Douglas did 
not take many steps to protect the surrounding areas from the noise. The 
company had previously put up large concrete blast fences at the test site to 
help deflect jet exhaust and sound. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant noted, however, that the primary purpose of blast fences is to 
screen off debris.

OLD LODGE ECHOES WITH NEW VOICES; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLAND PARK: A MASONIC HALL RICH IN ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS IS RESURRECTED FOR 
USE AS A COMMUNITY CENTER THAT IS A POPULAR SPOT FOR FESTIVITIES. 
</P>

Back in the old days, the distinguished gentlemen of the Highland Park Masonic 
Lodge sat along the ornate paneled walls of their grand meeting room and 
listened to programs such as "Snappy Kidding Songs by Mr. Warner" and "Two 
Organisms Universally Feared and Hated by Man," one of Alfreed Cookman's 
science talks. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the handsome halls of the lodge -- renamed, refurbished and added 
to the National Register of Historic Places -- still echo with the sounds of 
popular entertainments in Highland Park, but the particulars have changed. 
</P>
<P>
No longer a Masonic hall, the building at 104 N. Ave. 56 at the corner of North 
Figueroa Street now houses the Highland Cultural Center, a community meeting 
place and banquet hall. 
</P>
<P>
Up the sturdy stairway that in the 1920s welcomed 8-foot, 2-inch, 450-pound 
Masonic brother John Aasen, one of the lodge's most memorable members, now skip 
the feet of Catholic girls celebrating quinceaneras, their 15th birthdays. 
Brides, TV producers and Playboy models, the Highland Park Chamber of Commerce 
and politicians of almost every leaning now admire the rare Victorian paneling 
and run their fingers softly along time-smoothed cherry wood. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1923, the building ran the length of the block, featuring, as was 
typical for fraternal organizations, "spectacular" lodge and banquet rooms on 
the second floor and a row of retail outlets on the ground floor, said Christy 
Johnson McAvoy, a well-known preservation expert and consultant on the lodge's 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement gave the Masons a lavish meeting place while generating income 
from the shops on the ground floor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as then, the solid brick building, with its beautiful frieze near the roof 
line, anchored a pivotal corner in Highland Park, McAvoy said. Security Pacific 
National Bank and Charlie Chan's restaurant now share the intersection with the 
former Masonic building. A few doors down on Figueroa is the Highland Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Occupying the former Masonic building, where a barbershop and a cafe once were, 
are the headquarters of Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and a 
computer school. Project Head Start has a regional office over the Highland 
Cultural Center in the building. 
</P>
<P>
The corner is a hub of activity, just as it's always been. On Friday 
afternoons, when people are banking and parties are setting up at the Highland 
Cultural Center, finding a parking space is nothing less than a miracle, 
tenants say. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mason building, along with the bank building and the theater, signaled the 
coming of age of the Highland Park community in the 1920s," McAvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Malone, a former member of the Masons' youth group, the Order of DeMolay, 
remembers the building in its declining years during the late 1970s. The 
once-white banquet room walls had turned gray, and the elegant original 
chandeliers in the lodge room had been replaced by dull green 1950s fixtures 
that Malone said reminded him of inverted bottle caps. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, now 27 and a press secretary to Polanco, said he was sorry to see the 
Masons leave in 1982, but has been impressed by the transformation of the 
building since then. 
</P>
<P>
"Where our office stands now" on the first floor, along Avenue 56, "was a dingy 
sort of place we used to call the dungeon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all really quite beautiful now," Malone said. "The building has served as 
a catalyst for redevelopment . . . in this stretch of Highland Park." 
</P>
<P>
McAvoy said the project was the first in the neighborhood to obtain historic 
designations that qualified its owners for tax breaks when they restored the 
building. Other historic structures are now being identified; the Security 
Pacific Bank nearby recently underwent remodeling and other projects are 
planned, signaling that renovation is catching on near the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
But as is often the case with historical renovations, transformation of the 
one-time Masonic building into a cultural hall was slow and sometimes painful, 
McAvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Masons were forced to abandon the building in 1982 because they could not 
afford to pay for earthquake renovations mandated by the city. Two Glendale 
stepbrothers, Jerry Manpearl and Jerry Sullivan, purchased the building and 
applied almost immediately for local, state and historic designations to help 
offset the estimated $400,000 cost of shoring up and restoring the hall's 
interior and exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1985, the major work took three years. The old lodge room was left 
essentially intact but was rehung with antique light fixtures that the owners 
found at an auction. It was then renamed the Chandelier Room. Across the 
landing, the Masons' banquet room was dubbed the Terrace Room. Its French doors 
open to a balcony overlooking Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, an engineer, oversaw the earthquake repairs, ensuring that period 
doorknobs and architectural detailing were not lost. Most important, he said, 
was preservation of intricate panels in the former lodge room. Called 
anaglyphs, they are made of embossed cotton on wallboard and represent a lost 
Victorian art form. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcement beams were attached to the outside, not the interior, of 
18-inch-thick brick walls to preserve the interior; molding that had to be 
removed to reinforce walls with steel was painstakingly reassembled using saws 
and pocketknives. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the project was not without its critics. Local historians balked when signs 
they considered intrusive and out of historic character were mounted outside, 
so they quickly came down. McAvoy and others regret the loss of an interior 
balcony, which was partially removed to accommodate third-floor offices 
occupied by Project Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, McAvoy said the renovation work was of high enough quality to 
earn the stamp of approval of the U.S. Department of the Interior, which judges 
projects on stringent restoration criteria. 
</P>
<P>
By 1988, newly refinished doors were thrown open and on Jan. 18 this year, the 
old Masonic Hall, now the Highland Cultural Center, was added to the National 
Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Long-cold iron restaurant stoves that once cooked steak-and-potato lodge 
dinners are more likely to warm canapes and tortillas for wedding receptions 
and anniversary celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Sunbeams filtering through lace curtains in the Terrace Room have served as 
natural photographic lighting for furniture ads and telephone commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Secret doorways that might have been lost to the wrecking ball were 
incorporated into movie sets. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the Masons who once conducted solemn ceremonies in the historic building 
rarely return. Most are up in years and attend the Fellowship Lodge at 2433 N. 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, a certain heartbreak accompanied the move from the home lodge of the 
Highland Park regulars. J. Harry Smith, 83, a former member of the lodge, said: 
"I don't have any particular desire to see it now." 
</P>
<P>
If they ever stopped by for nostalgia's sake, the Masons might be gratified to 
see the new shine on the doorknobs still embossed with Masonic symbols. 
</P>
<P>
They might like to know that the manager, Tom Buford, is a Mason himself. He 
treasures yellowed letters that he found in the hall that recall good deeds of 
the Highland Park Masons of decades ago. In the old lodge room, he chuckles 
appreciatively at an oil painting of an Egyptian sphinx with a face remarkably 
like George Washington, an early Mason. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm familiar with all this symbolism. I probably have a deeper appreciation 
for the place than somebody else might," Buford said in his thick Cajun drawl. 
He said his Mason's ceremonial apron "will be placed in my casket." 
</P>
<P>
Buford's wife of nearly 40 years, Billie, serves as president of the center and 
remains an enthusiastic supporter of its preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just love this building," she said. "I have to keep telling myself, 'Billie, 
this is not your home!' " 
</P>
<P>
Together, the Bufords monitor the upkeep of the meeting rooms, arrange upcoming 
events and man the office during parties, film shoots and business meetings. 
Saturday nights, with both the Chandelier Room and the Terrace Room nearly 
always rented, Tom Buford remains in his second-floor office reading classic 
literature and lending the oft-forgotten knife to cut the wedding cake. 
</P>
<P>
When the parties wind down at midnight, he ushers in the cleaning crew, who kid 
with him in Spanish about the building's rumored ghosts -- "the terrores" -- 
and scrub the place until 3 or 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Buford is back, guiding tours and scheduling parties. 
</P>
<P>
"You smell how nice it is in here?" he asks bride-to-be Terry Cabral, 18. 
"That's because we clean up everything immediately. We don't spray. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ask for a damage deposit because some people regard a damage deposit 
as a license to break something," he adds, leading Cabral and her sister 
through the building. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral, impressed, books the smaller Terrace Room. The Chandelier Room is 
reserved on most Saturday nights through December. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as a public meeting place, the Highland Cultural Center is not 
always the site of gatherings as subdued as Masonic meetings. Buford said that, 
on occasion, he has had to roust drunks from late-night celebrations or 
assemble groups of "big strong boys" to cart out someone on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only once offered to lay a shillelagh on a boy," he said. By Buford's 
account, the boy backed down. 
</P>
<P>
Stag parties and a photo shoot for Playboy magazine have been more low-key but 
still jarring to his wife, daughter of a Baptist minister, Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
More to Buford's liking are celebrations such as the Ethiopian wedding in which 
the matrons ringed the floor in a traditional dance capped off with 
high-pitched whoops. He also enjoyed an oratorical contest recently sponsored 
by the Optimists in the Terrace Room, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Billie Buford stepped in to cater without charge a full dinner 
for a young woman who tearfully reported that her family had run on hard times 
since reserving the hall. That was an exception, but the Bufords like to see 
the building used for weddings. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I are always happy when people marry, when they are blessed by the 
church and do the right thing," he said. 'We like to think that we're more than 
just a business, we're a benefit to the community." 
</P>

CHAIR LEGS BROKEN IN REMOVAL FROM OLD THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle to save the historic Whittier Theatre has shifted from preserving 
its entirety to saving its best parts. In that effort, the most recent point of 
contention is the theater's seats, which have appeared unceremoniously in a lot 
on the building's west side. 
</P>
<P>
The seats' forcible removal from the auditorium snapped many of the legs off, 
said David Dickerson, the attorney whose legal motions delayed the historic 
theater's demolition. He said the seats should have been preserved in 
accordance with the guidelines of the environmental impact report for the site. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Kovacic, the developer's attorney and spokesman, said property owner Peter 
Doerkin was making every effort to comply with demolition guidelines and that 
Doerkin would sell pieces of the 1929 structure to interested parties at cost. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Friday, representatives of the property's owner may lead interested 
parties on a walk-through of the historic theater. The purpose will be to 
specify pieces of the 61-year-old structure that collectors wish to be 
preserved from the wrecking ball.

16-YEAR-OLD SENIOR BECOMES PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cerritos High School senior Paras P. Mehta, 16, has been selected one of the 
1990 Presidential Scholars. It is the highest federal honor given to high 
school seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta was among six students from California to be chosen. Of the 141 scholars 
selected throughout the nation, 121 were chosen on the basis of academic 
achievement, leadership and community and school involvement. The other 20 
selections were based on achievement in the creative or performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta has a 4.0 grade-point average and has received numerous academic awards. 
He currently serves as the student representative on the state Board of 
Education. He will enroll in Harvard University in the fall, but has not 
selected a major field of study. 
</P>
<P>
The students will be given the Presidential Scholar medallion at a White House 
ceremony in June. They also will receive $1,000 each from the Geraldine R. 
Dodge Foundation, a private philanthropic organization in Morristown, N.J.

PARENTS OBJECT TO MOVING PUPILS FROM 3 SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some parents are objecting to a Paramount Unified School District plan to move 
an estimated 700 elementary students from their neighborhood schools to a 
renovated facility to relieve overcrowded conditions in the 12,500-student 
system. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 parents attended a meeting Tuesday at Roosevelt Elementary School 
to discuss the plan with district personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is expected to go into effect in September. It will transfer students 
from the three most crowded elementary campuses, Hollydale, Roosevelt and 
Lincoln, to Wirtz Elementary School, Assistant Supt. Donald E. McGuigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Wirtz has been used as an annex for Paramount High School students. Those 
students will return to the high school campus in September after 40 newly 
constructed classrooms are expected to be completed. Wirtz also will be 
remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
Parents said they were most fearful of their children crossing busy streets and 
of traffic from the nearby Century Freeway, now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
The district said it will provide crossing guards, and the freeway overpasses 
will be enclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Another meeting is planned for May 15, before the Board of Education is 
expected to make a decision May 22.

Fifth-grader Scott Ward wants to be an astronaut. So do fourth-graders Victor 
Alvarez and Carlton Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Five space shuttle astronauts visited Ward Elementary School on Wednesday and 
left behind a comet's tail of excitement and motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to work hard to be something that you really want," Scott said. 
"Someday you'll make that dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong visit was arranged by Rockwell International Corp., which builds 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space shuttle orbiters. The 
firm's Space Transportation Systems Division, with headquarters in Downey, 
"adopted" Ward Elementary School in October. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 fourth- and fifth-grade students clapped loudly as three 
astronauts entered the school auditorium and made their way to the stage. Two 
other astronauts visited different classrooms to tell their stories of space 
and personal achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts took the space shuttle Columbia on an 11-day mission in January. 
They deployed a communications satellite and retrieved NASA's Long-Duration 
Exposure Facility, which contained various experiments. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Cmdr. Daniel C. Brandenstein told of the yearlong training for the 
mission, the workbooks and the films. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like you're starting at first grade and going through high 
school," Brandenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
He described the feeling of accelerating into space: "It's like having two of 
your buddies lying on top of you." 
</P>
<P>
Mission specialist G. David Low described his first view of space: "The black 
of space is blacker than anything you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
And he talked about the thin atmosphere that envelops the Earth: "That makes 
you realize how fragile this place really is and how collectively we have to 
take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
Mission specialist Bonnie J. Dunbar told of the effects of weightlessness on 
the human body and the need to follow an exercise program in space. 
</P>
<P>
"In zero (gravity), the heart doesn't work as hard," she said. "When a muscle 
doesn't work as hard, it gets smaller." 
</P>
<P>
Then the children asked their questions. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the most unusual thing you've seen in space?" 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar described a nighttime thunderstorm over Africa. "It's a light show you 
can't believe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Do the stars look different in space?" another student wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"The stars don't twinkle, and because there is no Earth's atmosphere and smog, 
you can see all of them," Dunbar said. "You get a feeling about what infinity 
is like." 
</P>
<P>
The visit was probably the biggest event ever to hit the 550-student school. 
Previously, Rockwell had arranged student tours of its Downey facility, among 
other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Ward Elementary also is one of many schools in the Los Angeles area that are 
growing tomato seeds exposed to outer space in the Long-Duration Exposure 
Facility. 
</P>
<P>
A Rockwell spokeswoman said the company has an investment in its partnership 
with Ward Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our big concerns, being a high-tech industry, is the declining interest 
in science in public education," spokeswoman Janet Dean said. "We hope we can 
motivate kids to be scientists, engineers and astronauts."

BELLFLOWER'S BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS VOTE FOR UNION

<P>
For the first time since the city was incorporated more than 30 years ago, City 
Hall blue-collar workers will be represented by a union. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Department employees, such as maintenance workers and mechanics, 
on Tuesday voted 24 to 8 to join the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees, which will represent them in contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very good about it," union representative Pete Schnaufer said. "We won 
in the face of several obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
The election victory gives momentum to the union's discussions with the city to 
represent clerical workers and part-time recreation employees, Schnaufer said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is willing to begin talks with city administrators immediately. 
Among the employees' top concerns are wages and insurance benefits after 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Schnaufer and city administrators have had several bitter confrontations since 
last summer, when the union first told City Hall that its blue-collar employees 
wanted union representation. Schnaufer has accused city leaders of stalling to 
avoid an election. Some city leaders have accused Schnaufer of grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees represents 
workers in several Southeast cities, including Hawaiian Gardens and Cerritos. 
Schnaufer said Bellflower city workers approached him in July, after city 
employees were given a 5% raise and city administrators received raises up to 
15%. 
</P>
<P>
"The workers blew up," Schnaufer said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Schnaufer and the city have been negotiating on guidelines for 
union representation. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Joe Cvetko said Wednesday that he expected the workers to seek 
union representation as soon as they heard of the management raises. 
</P>
<P>
"The city will survive," he said. "It's good for the men. I can work with the 
union." 
</P>
<P>
Cvetko said he was a member of the National Assn. of Letter Carriers union for 
many years.

STRONG, SILENT PITCHER FOR ST. ANTHONY LETS HIS ARM AND BAT DO THE TALKING 
</P>

<P>
He is tall and left-handed, which, for a pitcher, can be an imposing 
combination to begin with. More importantly, he throws a fastball that moves 
wickedly. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Mooney of St. Anthony High School was dispensing with some Pius X High 
batters on a recent afternoon at Guesno Field in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Two veteran major league scouts sat behind the backstop and directed their 
radar guns at the 6-foot-3, 200-pound Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything moves," said Jack French of the San Francisco Giants, talking about 
Mooney's pitches. "He gets all his shoulder into it. It seems like he's 
throwing like a pro already, as far as form goes." 
</P>
<P>
Art Sherman of the Milwaukee Brewers added: "He's potentially a good prospect. 
He's strong and he likes to play." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman's gun revealed that Mooney had just thrown a pitch 83 m.p.h., which is 
good for a high school pitcher, according to French. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one guy I've seen this year in high school, junior college or 
college who's thrown 90, and that was a pitcher at Long Beach State, (Dennis) 
Gray," French said. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney pitches in the highly competitive Camino Real League, which is composed 
of Division 2-A schools. But Sherman said he would also fare well against 
larger schools. 
</P>
<P>
"He could throw in the Moore League," Sherman said. "There are a lot of JCs and 
colleges interested in him."

John Herbold, coach at Cal State Los Angeles, looked over from his spot behind 
the screen and said: "What do you think I'm here for?" 
</P>
<P>
Mooney could be selected in the June professional draft, but if he is not, he 
said, he may attend St. Mary's College in Moraga. "I'd like to go into pro ball 
(eventually)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He threw a curve ball and a Pius X batter lined it into left field for a hit. 
After that he decided to stick with the fastball and he went on to strike out 
12 batters in a 9-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old senior has a 6-4 record and a 2.12 earned run average. One of 
his victories was over No. 1-ranked El Segundo, 4-3. In 65 innings he has 
struck out 103 batters and walked 19. 
</P>
<P>
He is the major reason why St. Anthony, 11-8 overall and 10-2 in the league 
before Wednesday's rematch with El Segundo, will be in the CIF Southern Section 
playoffs for the first time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching in the little park at Del Amo Boulevard and Clark Avenue is not an 
advantage for Mooney. The fences, topped with 20-foot-high nets, are not far 
away. It is only 250 feet down the right-field line and less than 300 to the 
power alleys. 
</P>
<P>
A .335 hitter and the team's RBI (21) and home run leader (7), Mooney plays 
first base when he is not pitching. He homered against Pius X; the ball landed 
in a back yard beyond the net in right. But he prefers being on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to be a pitcher because at every place else on the field you're not 
in on every play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney lets his arm and bat speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kind of quiet," said Saints Coach Ron Tostenson. "He's a hard worker and 
very coachable." 
</P>
<P>
Because St. Anthony does not have a pitching coach, Mooney has to look 
elsewhere for help. Last summer he worked with former major league pitcher Vern 
Ruhl, now pitching coach at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught me how to use my legs more," Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney averaged 16 points for St. Anthony's JV basketball team last season but 
decided this year to concentrate solely on the sport he has played since he was 
6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
That dedication has been rewarded.

CLASS LOOKS DEEPLY INTO ESSENCE OF JEWISH JOKES; 
</P>
<P>
HUMOR: 'COMEDY WROUGHT FROM TRAGEDY,' MODERATOR TELLS UCLA CLASS. IT'S A WAY 
FOR AN OPPRESSED RACE TO EXPRESS ITS PHILOSOPHY, ANOTHER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning was the joke. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing the origins of Jewish humor at UCLA on a recent Monday night, 
psychologist Benjamin Hulkower cited the first reference to laughter in the 
Bible. An already venerable Abraham tells his aged wife Sarah that they are to 
have a child. The result is Isaac, whose Hebrew name, Yitzak, is derived from 
the word for "to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
The Jews, a people whose very prophets had a sense of humor, have had a less 
than rollicking history, speakers noted at the first of four classes on Jewish 
humor offered by UCLA Extension. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's define Jewish humor as comedy wrought from tragedy," said organizer and 
moderator Elinor Lenz. "We are going to look at a people whose historical 
experience has given them very little to laugh about." 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, has Jewish humor endured as a major cultural force? Lenz speculated 
that Jews share the wisdom of the French philosopher Beaumarchais, who wrote: 
"I force myself to laugh at everything for fear of being compelled to weep." 
</P>
<P>
"Above all, Jewish humor is the knowing, ironic laughter of the outsider," said 
Lenz. Then she told the one about the woman who was sitting by a pool in Miami. 
"Why are you so pale?" the woman asked the man next to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in jail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"For what?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Killing my wife," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"That means you're single?" 
</P>
<P>
Nursing a cold, comedian Steve Allen greeted the audience, "Good evening, 
ladies and Gentiles." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who is an actor, writer and musician as well as a comedian, noted that 
American humor has come to be virtually synonymous with Jewish humor. All his 
favorite comics are Jewish, most notably Sid Caesar, said Allen, who is Irish. 
</P>
<P>
"Irish humor is characterized by a certain poetry," Allen said, "but Jewish 
humor is characterized by a philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow speaker Benjamin Hulkower, a psychologist who told jokes in the 
Catskills many years ago, argued that "Jewish humor is geared to survival." 
</P>
<P>
Like other participants, Hulkower peppered his remarks with jokes, including 
this illustration of the difference between involvement and commitment: "On a 
plate of steak and eggs, the chicken is involved," he said, "the cow is 
committed." 
</P>
<P>
Yuks notwithstanding, Hulkower was serious in trying to pinpoint the essence of 
Jewish humor. It is often the humor of the oppressed, he noted. In a world that 
is hostile or worse, the joke can be an act of defiance, a kind of heroism. The 
mind dances when nothing else can. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't change your circumstance," Hulkower said, "at least you can think 
of it in different terms." To illustrate, he cited his mother-in-law's 
experience in Hitler's death camps. She survived, she told him, by thinking of 
the unspeakable as a game. "I woke up in the morning, and I was in the game," 
she recalled. "And if I went to bed at night, I had won the game." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Breuer, executive director of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, described 
Jewish humor as anti-authoritarian, substantive and critical. He noted that a 
cynic or scoffer, who is both part of the community and a critical commentator 
on it, is a staple of Jewish tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Jews are not afraid to laugh at themselves, Breuer and others said. Like 
members of other minorities, he noted, Jews tell jokes among themselves they 
would be offended to hear told by non-Jews. He told the story of the two Jews 
who are rescued from a desert island where they have built three huts. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are synagogues," the men tell their rescuers when asked what the huts 
are. "My synagogue, his synagogue and the one neither of us would belong to." 
</P>
<P>
Such jokes serve to bind Jews together, Breuer said. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between God and his chosen people is another durable theme of 
Jewish humor, the panel noted. Unlike members of more dour faiths, Jews tell 
jokes about the deity, Hulkower pointed out. The psychologist ad-libbed a comic 
exchange about circumcision between Abraham and his maker: 
</P>
<P>
"Let me get this straight," the patriarch said. "They get all the land and the 
oil, and we get to cut a piece off what?" 
</P>
<P>
Jews also joke about relations between Jews and the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"My priest knows more than your rabbi," a Catholic boy says to a Jewish boy. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, sure. You tell him everything." 
</P>
<P>
Humor is a way of life for Jews, the panel suggested. Lenz recounted a 
conversation with her brother, composer Mel Powell, who recently won the 
Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. 
</P>
<P>
What would mother have said if she had lived to see it? she asked her brother. 
</P>
<P>
Powell answered: "She would have said, 'Very nice -- but he doesn't eat.' "

The City Council has decided to establish a program to recycle paper and other 
materials used at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The council directed City Administrator Louis Sheppard to develop a recycling 
and conservation program in the next few weeks. In addition to saving office 
paper for recycling, the city will try to use two-sided printing whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Sheppard also is considering issuing coffee mugs to employees to reduce the 
number of disposable cups used at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to determine if all the problems are being addressed before we 
proceed," he said.

REDWOODS BOND ON BALLOT, BACKERS SAY

Proponents of an initiative to buy vast stands of redwood forests from lumber 
companies and exclude them from logging say they have gathered more than 
800,000 signatures -- more than double the number needed -- to qualify the 
measure for the November ballot. If approved, the $742-million bond issue also 
would restructure the nine-member state Board of Forestry, which sets foresting 
policy, by limiting the timber industry to one representative while setting 
aside three seats on the panel for members of environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
All Forestry Board members, appointed by the governor and lieutenant governor, 
would be subject to confirmation by the state Senate. About 100,000 acres of 
redwood trees remain in California, but about 20,000 acres, mostly in the 
north, are not protected by state or federal statues and could be cut under 
present law.

BUDGET: THEY WILL SEEK TO AVERT AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS. 'SEVERE ACTION' IS 
NEEDED 'TO KEEP THE ECONOMY ON A SOUND TRACK,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS. SESSIONS BEGIN 
TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After three days of urgent meetings, President Bush and congressional leaders 
agreed Wednesday to begin a series of top-level budget negotiations because 
"severe action needs to be taken to reduce the deficit and keep the economy on 
a sound track," the White House announced. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with signals of a weakening economy and a ballooning deficit, Bush, 
senior economic advisers and key members of Congress responsible for budget 
legislation will begin debating their options for raising government revenue 
and trimming spending from the 1991 budget. 
</P>
<P>
Their goal is to find a way to avoid the automatic spending cuts that would be 
triggered if they do not meet the $64-billion budget deficit target established 
in the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. 
</P>
<P>
But their task has been made more complicated -- and urgent -- by rising 
interest rates, a recent increase in unemployment, slower economic growth and 
the burgeoning costs of the federal bailout of ailing savings and loan 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, 
has predicted that unless quick action is taken, stark, across-the-board budget 
cuts of up to $100 billion could be required in the $1.2-trillion spending plan 
for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden focus on the budget -- and the agreement to try to tackle the 
deficit with no "preconditions" -- has opened debate over tax increases, which 
Bush pledged during the 1988 presidential campaign to block. It also has raised 
the politically charged issue of whether to allow Social Security 
cost-of-living increases to go unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans who met Tuesday with Bush raised the prospect of higher gasoline 
and cigarette taxes, and threw into the discussion the possibility of a 
national sales tax. They discounted, however, the possibility of increasing 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
With the "budget summit" scheduled to begin Tuesday at the White House, 
Democrats and Republicans in Congress have made it clear that they are 
unwilling to initiate formal talk of tax hikes -- let alone endorse them -- 
unless Bush takes the first step. 
</P>
<P>
White House aides, meanwhile, have refused to signal whether the President is 
ready to step back from his highly visible campaign pledge of "no new taxes." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have said that raising taxes has to be on the table. But no 
preconditions means just the opposite. It means the table is clean," said White 
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, dampening speculation that Bush might 
be ready to support a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
The potential stalemate was reflected by Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who said: "The 
President feels a lot about taxes the way he feels about broccoli: You can put 
it on the table in front of him, but he's not gonna eat it." 
</P>
<P>
Creation of a bipartisan budget group is intended to provide enough political 
protection for both parties to enable Republicans and Democrats, President and 
Congress, to share the responsibility for distasteful budget cuts or tax hikes 
without paying a political price. 
</P>
<P>
But just the possibility, raised at Bush's first budget meeting with 
congressional leaders Sunday evening, that a tax increase could be thrown into 
the mix brought out a partisan uproar on Capitol Hill that so far has shown no 
signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
House Republicans emerged from a meeting Wednesday morning virtually united 
against higher taxes as part of any budget deal, opting instead for spending 
cuts or stretching out the balanced-budget targets for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"If Democrats want higher taxes, we expect them to put higher taxes on the 
table," said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House 
Ways and Means Committee, and one of the congressional budget negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's negotiating position will be no new taxes," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), chairman of the House Budget Committee 
and another member of the negotiating team, has urged Bush to begin seeking 
public support for the politically sensitive decisions that the meetings could 
produce to make eventual congressional approval more likely. 
</P>
<P>
"Strong proposals coming out of a summit would face a very tough time in the 
House and Senate" because of election-year concerns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the pressure of the November elections growing and the somber economic 
signals mounting, White House and congressional officials acknowledged a need 
to act quickly. Some expressed hope that an agreement could be reached before 
Congress begins its July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
That would throw the complex budget talks into a busy White House calendar that 
already includes the May 30-June 3 summit between Bush and Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as well as preparations for a later North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization summit meeting and an international economic conference scheduled 
for early July in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined by Fitzwater, the goals of the budget negotiators are to achieve a 
substantial reduction of the projected budget deficit in fiscal 1991, which 
begins Oct. 1, and in several subsequent years and to devise a plan that will 
allow continued economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The group also will seek to revise the process by which Congress acts on the 
budget and find a way to avoid the economic pitfalls that could stem from a 
budget stalemate between the Republican White House and the 
Democratic-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But how those goals will be accomplished remains obscured by the fog of 
partisan debate and concerns that unpopular decisions could be used against 
either party in the upcoming congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The only decision that's been made is to begin discussions in good faith and 
attempt to reach a solution of the problem," said Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
"It's premature to speculate on what might be in the agreement, and then to 
speculate on top of that speculation as to what someone might say about that 
speculated agreement, and then to speculate as to what someone might respond to 
that speculation about that speculated agreement," Mitchell said.

SAN DIEGO MAYOR OPPOSES MANDATORY WATER LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city manager recommended Wednesday that San Diego join the growing ranks of 
Southern California cities that have responded to the drought by adopting 
mandatory water conservation rules. But Mayor Maureen O'Connor promptly 
announced that she favors voluntary water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is one of just five cities and water districts in the county that 
have not declared the Stage 2 water alerts that limit when citizens can water 
lawns, wash cars and fill swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the San Diego County Water Authority, which supplies all but 
a trickle of the water consumed in the county, urged its member agencies, 
including the city of San Diego, to declare water alerts because the drought 
has reduced the amount of imported water by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad and Poway on Tuesday night became the latest water distribution 
agencies in the county to adopt mandatory water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our (24) member agencies have already set a date for implementation of 
Stage 2 alerts," county Water Authority spokesman Bill Jacoby said Wednesday. 
"Only five, including the city of San Diego, have not." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego council members Wednesday received copies of a city manager's report 
that endorses the Stage 2 mandatory conservation alert. The council will debate 
the need for water conservation during Monday's council session. 
</P>
<P>
The Stage 2 alert proposed by the city manager would limit lawn watering, car 
washing and filling swimming pools to the hours from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m. Residents 
with addresses ending in odd numbers would be allowed to use water on Mondays, 
Wednesdays and Saturdays. Even-numbered addresses would be allowed to use water 
on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to O'Connor's outright opposition to mandatory controls, the city 
manager's report generated disagreement among council members on how mandatory 
conservation should be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Councilman Ron Roberts said mandatory conservation should be in place 
by June 1. Roberts, who on Monday will introduce a plan that includes most of 
the recommendations included in a city manager's report, said he was 
"embarrassed that we don't have it in place already. . . . We should have done 
this last summer." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt believes that "the city manager's report is going 
in the right direction," said Jay Powell, Bernhardt's environmental adviser. 
But Bernhardt also is concerned that Roberts might be "jumping the gun" by 
trying to adopt a mandatory program without proper planning and citizen 
education, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt wants council members to construct a "positive" program in which 
residential customers understand that they have a variety of options to reduce 
water use, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members also voiced support for a mandatory conservation program. 
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer is "supportive of the second phase," an aide 
said. "She thinks you have to be realistic, the reservoirs are getting lower 
and we need to conserve." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor believes that it's too soon to set mandatory conservation in 
place, according to a draft of a memorandum that O'Connor plans to circulate to 
council members today. 
</P>
<P>
In the memorandum, O'Connor argues that a mandatory conservation program is not 
needed this summer because San Diegans, who in the past have willingly met 
"civic challenges . . . will react with equal civic-mindedness to the present 
water dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's memo states that during water shortages in 1957 and 1977, San 
Diegans voluntarily reduced water use by 20% and 15%, respectively. Similar 
savings could be generated through an "intensive education-information 
program," the memo says. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor hopes to win support for a voluntary conservation plan that will 
reduce use by 10% among government, industry and residential water users. The 
memo states that San Diego State University, UC San Diego, Caltrans, the 
University of San Diego, Sea World and other large water users have agreed to 
the mayor's request that they cut water use by 10% during the next three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor is also opposed to mandatory conservation because the program would 
worsen the city's woeful economic outlook for the fiscal year that begins July 
1, according to the memo. "Voluntary compliance will not only save water but 
save the city $4.8 million from a proposed mandatory water conservation 
budget," the memo states. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts argued Wednesday that the mandatory conservation plan that he will 
introduce Monday would not significantly increase the city's budget woes, in 
part because state and federal funds are available. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's opposition to mandatory conservation puts her directly at odds with 
the County Water Authority, which distributes water in San Diego County, and 
the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, which imports most of the 
water consumed in Southern California. Both of those agencies have asked their 
member agencies to enact Stage 2 water alerts. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members, in a report issued Wednesday, noted that "concern has been 
expressed by the MWD, CWA, CWA member agencies, press and public regarding San 
Diego's position on this issue . . . it is critical that the City of San Diego 
actively participate in cooperative water conservation measures." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor's memo suggests that, "thanks to some long-range vision on the 
part of local officials, San Diego's water problem is not so severe" as the 
situation faced by some other Southern California cities. "We have an adequate 
supply of water, but must face the reality that it is prudent to shift into a 
voluntary conservation program before a real emergency occurs." 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Wednesday, Deputy City Manager H. R. Frauenfelder 
recommended that the City Council adopt the Stage 2 alert and implement five of 
12 programs included in an April 26 report to the council. Those programs are 
designed to further reduce water use in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Those five programs are: 
</P>
<P>
Installation of ultra-low flush toilets at city facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Investigation of water-waste complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of a full-time water-waste investigation team. 
</P>
<P>
Development of a water consumption data base for the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption of a new water rate structure that would tend to discourage use by 
raising the incremental price of water. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager also recommended that several other programs be studied by a 
committee that will include representatives of the county Water Authority, San 
Diegans Inc., the San Diego Board of Realtors, the Apartment Owners Assn., the 
American Society of Plumbing Engineers, the Sierra Club and the Metro Sewer 
Task Force.

Key allies of the United States warned Wednesday that the Bush Administration's 
opposition to a new aid package that would help Third World countries switch to 
ozone-friendly chemicals could jeopardize efforts to repair the widening hole 
in the Earth's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Geneva sponsored by the United Nations to amend an accord on 
the ozone problem, delegates from Japan, Australia and European countries 
roundly criticized American opposition to the proposed $100-million aid 
program. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Ambassador Richard Smith officially 
announced its opposition to a proposal to help Third World countries pay the 
higher cost of switching to substitutes for ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) when they become available. 
</P>
<P>
But delegates to the conference said that unless financially pressed developing 
countries such as China and India are persuaded to join an international accord 
to limit use and production of CFCs, planned cutbacks by industrialized 
countries will be futile. 
</P>
<P>
Neither India nor China has ratified the accord, known as the Montreal 
Protocol, and both are committed to raising their standards of living by making 
refrigeration widely available to their burgeoning populations. CFCs are used 
as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners. Although substitutes are 
being developed that are less harmful to the Earth's ozone layer, they will be 
more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said in Washington on 
Wednesday that the Bush Administration sees no need for additional funding to 
deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time the resources are sufficient," he said. "We do not feel it is 
sensible to set up new financial mechanisms with new rules, regulations and 
procedures. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The position reportedly was formulated by White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu and Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, 
over the objections of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. 
Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
An official observer at the meeting said from Geneva on Wednesday that the U.S. 
position also would place the Administration against tough new restrictions on 
ozone-destroying chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that the aid program and the new restrictions, which the United 
States has supported, are scheduled to be voted on together at a major ozone 
accord conference in London next month. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only going to be one vote, up or down, on the entire package of 
amendments," said David Doniger, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
Doniger said the United States had "isolated" itself, and he quoted a delegate 
from Norway as calling the decision "mind-boggling. . . . Not even the Japanese 
backed America. The U.S. position amounts to making Third World countries rob 
Peter to pay Paul." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of numerous Third World countries are scheduled to address the 
Geneva conference today. 
</P>
<P>
At a separate conference last month in New Delhi, about 20 developing countries 
from Asia, Africa and Latin America met to forge a united front before the 
London conference and called for the financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the United States announced its opposition to the package, it had 
been accused of acting too slowly on global environmental proposals. 
</P>
<P>
At a conference called by Bush in Washington last month, the President 
irritated some European participants by focusing on the scientific 
uncertainties of global warming instead of pressing for immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Wednesday, 12 Republican senators led by Sen. John H. Chafee 
of Rhode Island urged Bush to rethink the decision. "Our negotiating team has 
isolated the U.S. and placed us in an untenable position," the senators said. 
They noted that the U.S. share of the fund would be $25 million over three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"For this small amount, the United States is threatening to disrupt the 
negotiations to strengthen the protocol. There has rarely been, we believe, a 
better example of being penny-wise and pound-foolish." 
</P>
<P>
Criticism also came from several Senate Democrats, including Joseph I. 
Lieberman of Connecticut and Albert Gore of Tennessee, who called the position 
"shortsighted and just plain outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers James Gerstenzang and William Eaton in Washington 
contributed to this story.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ida Ballasiotes' first thought, upon hearing the criminal history of the man 
who'd raped and killed her daughter, came in the form of a question. 
</P>
<P>
What was this guy doing out of jail? she wondered. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the authorities had known Gene Raymond Kane was dangerous. He'd 
attacked two other women 13 years before, and he'd been sitting in prison ever 
since. He'd received no treatment during that time, mainly because a mental 
hospital considered him too dangerous to handle. In 1985, a prison psychologist 
thought Kane's chance for successful adjustment to society "quite poor." Still, 
officials in mid-1988 had decided to "transition" Kane back into the community 
through a downtown Seattle work-release center. He'd been there just two months 
when he killed Diane Ballasiotes on Sept. 26, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dwelling on these facts, Ida Ballasiotes found her puzzlement swelling into a 
rage. Diane's death was not like an earthquake, she told herself. It wasn't an 
act of God. They had this man's record staring at him. They knew. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can bring our daughter back," she wrote Washington's governor, Booth 
Gardner, a week after Diane's murder. "The light has gone from our hearts. But, 
be assured, we will work and mobilize forces to get change and reform . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The initial response from state authorities was uncomplicated and distinctly 
colored by their sense for the fundamentals of the law. Gene Kane was out of 
jail, they explained, because he'd finished serving his full sentence. The 
state could not confine him any longer. The state could hold a person only for 
what he'd done, not for what he might do. 
</P>
<P>
"What were the alternatives?" wrote Chase Riveland, secretary of the state 
department of corrections. "The suspect could not have been retained 
indefinitely in maximum security. Law and court decisions demanded his release 
imminently." 
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, we know statistically that there will be inmates who will re-offend, 
yet no foolproof system has been developed to accurately predict on an 
individual basis who those people will be . . . ." added Gov. Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
Ida Ballasiotes' fury only deepened as she studied these replies. They lose 
sight of what the hell happened here, she thought. Let's strip it away to what 
happened. Someone is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Ballasiotes sat down at her typewriter. She was not quite finished with her 
letter writing. 
</P>
<P>
So began a grass-roots citizens campaign in Washington that has forced 
authorities into treacherous territory. How to preserve the letter and spirit 
of the Constitution while still keeping dangerous people such as Gene Kane off 
the streets? It is an abiding dilemma within the judicial system, exacerbated 
everywhere by the growing public alarm over drugs and crime. A decision to 
detain someone in order to prevent a future crime may be prudent, may be rooted 
in realistic assessment, but it's not consistent with the law's most basic 
tenets. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Washington, however, has decided to try some tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 28, Gov. Gardner signed into law an omnibus package aimed at violent 
sex offenders. Among the new statute's several provisions is a civil commitment 
procedure that will allow authorities to confine in locked treatment centers, 
until they are cured, a group of people defined as "sexual predators." A sexual 
predator, as spelled out in the law, is one who has previously committed a 
violent sex crime and now is found by a judge and jury to suffer a "mental 
abnormality" or "personality disorder" which makes him "likely to engage in 
predatory acts of sexual violence." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the law will allow the state, acting on predictions of future 
dangerousness, to confine indefinitely people who are not mentally ill, as 
defined by medical specialists, and who do not have a criminal charge pending 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
Questions have been raised by those who believe the law will prove neither 
effective nor legal, but their numbers are few, and their voices muted. Many 
more people have fought to make the new law even tougher. Not the least 
intriguing element of Washington's current situation is the manner in which the 
authors of the sex offender law have emerged as a moderating influence. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative was to lock up hundreds or thousands of people for life," said 
King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng, who headed the task force that drafted the 
new law. "Our way was much more selective." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Familiar Ring 
</P>
<P>
It was the particulars that made Diane Ballasiotes' death especially 
disturbing. She'd left her job at a downtown Seattle advertising agency one 
evening at 5:30 and just disappeared. The missing-person posters her friends 
nailed everywhere described her as 5 feet-5 inches, 110 pounds, 29 years old, 
with curly shoulder-length auburn hair. Last seen, the poster said, leaving the 
1st and Yesler area of Pioneer Square, heading toward the 3rd and Yesler U-Park 
garage, dressed in a navy skirt and tennis sweater. A Park Department employee 
had found the body a week later, while looking for garbage being dumped in 
another part of town, along Cheasty Boulevard South. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Ballasiotes' murder alone would not, however, have brought the present 
upheaval. Even when a group called Friends of Diane began staging rallies and 
circulating petitions, the state government's response was muted. Then came two 
more violent sexual assaults, involving circumstances with a familiar ring. 
</P>
<P>
First, in December of 1988, a man broke into the apartment of a 23-year-old 
Pierce County woman, removed a light bulb and lay in wait in her darkened 
bedroom. When she returned, he tied her to the bed, raped her and slashed her 
with a knife. The assailant was Gary Minnix, who'd been charged with four 
vicious knife-related rapes in 1986 and linked by Seattle police to 22 other 
such cases. He'd never been convicted though -- he'd been found incompetent to 
stand trial because he was mentally retarded, with an IQ possibly as low as 48. 
He'd eventually ended up at Western State Hospital, but authorities there had 
no legal basis to keep him under tight security. He was a "gravely disabled" 
person, after all, not a convicted criminal. He was on his sixth weekend 
furlough when he assaulted the Pierce County woman. 
</P>
<P>
Then, five months later, in May of 1989, a 7-year-old boy riding his bike near 
his Tacoma home was dragged into the nearby woods, raped, choked nearly to 
death and sexually mutilated. Before leaving him semi-conscious in the dirt, 
Earl K. Shriner cut off the boy's penis. Shriner's history, and his heinous 
crime, proved the most disturbing of all to people in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Shriner had a 24-year record of assaults on young people, dating back to an 
involvement in the killing of a 15-year-old schoolmate when he was 16. 
Diagnosed at the age of 3 as being mentally retarded, he'd spent his youth in 
juvenile centers, schools for the disabled and -- when he became too violent -- 
a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his release in his mid-20s, he'd kidnapped and assaulted two teen-age 
girls and subsequently had been sentenced to prison for 10 years. Aware of his 
history, authorities never considered him for parole -- he served his full 
sentence. Faced finally with the prospect of releasing Shriner in May of 1987, 
corrections officials still balked -- they tried to get him committed 
involuntarily to Western State Hospital. But doctors ruled he didn't meet the 
legal criteria, because he wasn't mentally ill or, just then, acting in a 
violently dangerous manner. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't mean he wasn't a likely danger in the future. A psychiatric 
evaluation at that time said Shriner "has unusual sexually sadistic fantasies 
and plans to carry them out." This was an accurate enough appraisal, since 
Shriner had once told a cellmate he wanted a van with cages so he could pick up 
children and imprison, sexually abuse and kill them. By law, though, Shriner 
couldn't be confined for an ominous statement or a sinister psychological 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the state could only commit people if they suffered from a 
distinct, recognized mental disorder making them immediately and substantially 
dangerous to themselves or others. The state couldn't commit a dangerous person 
who wasn't mentally ill. The state also couldn't commit a dangerous person if 
his mental illness wasn't the cause of his dangerousness. 
</P>
<P>
"He had served every day of his sentence," a corrections official explained 
later. "He served all the time he was supposed to serve." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Outrage 
</P>
<P>
There are those who now ask bitterly why it took a boy's rape and mutilation 
before a male-dominated system responded. "It's because the Legislature is male 
and could relate to it," concluded Helen Harlow, mother of the mutilated Tacoma 
boy. But it might also have had something to do with the particularly ferocious 
public outrage aroused by Shriner's assault. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Friends of Diane and a new group called the Tennis Shoe Brigade 
marched on the state capitol in Olympia, where they dumped thousands of tennis 
shoes -- a symbol of children's vulnerability, they explained -- in Gov. 
Gardner's outer office. "These are the shoes of a beautiful 18-year-old girl 
who was murdered last summer," read the unsigned note attached to a pair of 
white exercise shoes. Holding aloft her son's red high-top sneakers, Helen 
Harlow said: "He could be anybody's child. He could be anybody's grandchild." 
</P>
<P>
Across the state, disparate voices joined the protest. People who'd never 
before written public officials now lifted pens. Employees in restaurants 
organized fund drives for the maimed Tacoma boy. Thousands called elected 
officials to demand change. Plans were formed to convert the site of Shriner's 
attack into a park named after his victim (who was undergoing apparently 
successful reconstructive surgery). "The degree of outrage and mobilization . . 
. is unprecedented in recent history," prosecutor Maleng observed of this 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The citizen's demands were uncomplicated: Don't let these kind of assaults 
happen. Figure out a way to keep people of this sort confined. Don't let them 
out. Give them life sentences, or put them away somewhere forever. And don't 
drag your heels doing this. 
</P>
<P>
Over and over, the Tennis Shoe Brigade and Friends of Diane demanded that 
Gardner convene a special session of the Legislature to pass emergency 
legislation. The governor, a moderate Democrat, did not want to do it. "There's 
a lot of passion out there," his spokesman, Dick Milne, observed at one point, 
"but it would be wrong to react at a gut level to this. We can't overnight 
start devising laws that are going to stand up in court." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Gardner last summer appointed a "task force on community protection," 
hoping it would channel the citizen's outrage into a more measured, reasoned 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Some still were dubious. "I didn't even want the task force convened," said one 
of its members, state legislator Marlin Appelwick, chairman of the House 
Judiciary Committee. "The public mood, in Pierce County particularly, was near 
vigilantism. I feared we'd be forced to do very radical extreme things." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Stroke 
</P>
<P>
It is now generally acknowledged that picking King County prosecutor Norm 
Maleng to head the task force represented a masterful political stroke by 
Gardner, one that eased concerns such as Appelwick's and neutralized possible 
critics on both sides. Maleng had been Gardner's Republican opponent in the 
last gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
"Maleng is very widely respected, a brilliant pick," said Bob Boruchowitz, 
director of the Seattle-King County Public Defenders Assn. "You know it's not 
going to be a whitewash when you pick your opponent, and with Maleng you also 
know it's not going to be a screaming crazy guy. He is reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
After a series of emotionally moving public hearings, where 151 victims rose to 
tell their often harrowing stories -- the picnic table gang rape of a 
3-year-old girl by her father and his friends being one that stuck in some 
minds -- the job of drafting much of the sex predator bill fell to task force 
member David Boerner, a University of Puget Sound law professor. Boerner, too, 
was considered a reasonable man even by opponents. He was a liberal-minded 
former prosecutor who, seeing there were going to be changes, told colleagues 
he thought it best to get involved in the process in order to limit its effect. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, elements of the bill fell into place, fashioned by a group that 
included Ida Ballasiotes, Helen Harlow and two other representatives from 
victims' families among the customary professors, prosecutors, doctors and 
social workers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill greatly increased prison sentences for sex crimes. The bill allowed 
police to warn the public when sexual offenders were being released from 
confinement. The bill created a central registry of released offenders, 
including photographs and fingerprints. The bill provided expanded services and 
treatment both for victims and youthful offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Task force members were particularly proud of this last provision and the 
considerable state funding it mandated. To have an impact, they explained after 
their months of research, you must get to sexually active juveniles as early as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
None of these provisions, however, addressed the central question the task 
force had been formed to answer: What to do about the Earl Shriners and Gary 
Minnixes and Gene Kanes, once they are adults? Yes, some are retarded, and yes, 
most as children suffered horrible beatings and sexual abuse by alcoholic 
parents -- but now what? 
</P>
<P>
It was, Maleng, Boerner and their colleagues knew, not at all a simple 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"Incarceration of people not mentally ill because of what they might do is 
'preventive' penal detention which is an unconstitutional infringement of the 
right to due process and equal protection," the task force itself pointed out 
in an early briefing paper. "The state must prove that a person has committed 
crimes before depriving the person of their liberty." 
</P>
<P>
The procedures for involuntary commitment were restrictive for good reason, the 
task force added: "Our current state law was developed during a reform period 
when arbitrary and indefinite commitments of individuals were a major concern. 
The law was designed to limit the considerable discretion the medical 
professional had over continued commitment of patients, as well as limiting the 
power of family members in committing individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there were plenty of people, some on the task force, who didn't much 
care about the commitment laws anyway. They felt the response to sexual 
predators should be kept within the criminal justice system. Washington and 
most states, after all, for decades had tried treating sex offenders in 
hospitals under various sex psychopathy laws, only to back away from that 
approach in recent years, mainly because it hadn't worked. Those sent to 
hospitals proved just as likely to commit additional crimes as those sent to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
So forget treatment, argued many in Washington, including the state attorney 
general. Instead, greatly increase sentences. And give life sentences for 
second offenses -- 104 months instead of 52 months doesn't make a person safer 
when he gets out. 
</P>
<P>
This prison-over-treatment attitude, as it happens, reflects the current trend 
in most states. Even Illinois and Massachusetts, the two states with 
civil-commitment laws somewhat similar to Washington's new statute, are 
considering their repeal. 
</P>
<P>
Maleng and his colleagues, however, decided to buck this return to a reliance 
on the criminal system. Required, but not overly eager, to act, they wanted a 
narrower and less bluntly edged alternative. 
</P>
<P>
The task force members knew the state was free to define broadly what 
constituted "mental illness" and "treatment." So why not, they reasoned, create 
a new diagnostic category, making eligible for commitment those "likely to 
engage in predatory acts of sexual violence." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the task force chose to define "acts of sexual violence" broadly: 
They included the major sex offenses -- rape, indecent liberties, child 
molestation -- and also lesser offenses such as second-degree assault and 
residential burglary, provided that those crimes were "determined to have been 
sexually motivated." 
</P>
<P>
Those deemed likely to commit such crimes could be confined in a treatment 
center -- within a prison grounds -- if they were nearing the end of a criminal 
sentence or juvenile detention, if they'd been found not guilty of a sex 
offense by reason of insanity or if they'd been determined incompetent to stand 
trial on a sex offense charge. 
</P>
<P>
Confinement could be ordered only by a judge at the request of a county 
prosecutor. There would be a jury trial, where the defendant could have a 
lawyer and expert witnesses, and the state would have to prove its case beyond 
a reasonable doubt. If committed, the "predator" would be provided treatment 
and an annual review by state authorities, who could release him if they deemed 
him cured. And he could petition for release on his own, and get it, if he 
proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was cured. 
</P>
<P>
It cannot be said that Maleng, Boerner and others on the task force were 
unaware of the objections this plan would arouse. After all, they themselves 
had spelled out some of them in their earlier briefing papers. Two particular 
problems suggested themselves immediately. The proposed bill called upon 
medical personnel to treat people whom history and the doctors themselves 
generally say are untreatable. And it asked psychiatrists to predict future 
dangerousness, even though research overwhelmingly showed that these experts 
were wrong in at least two out of three cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preventive Detention 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors and lawyers soon enough raised just these points, and others. Talk 
as much as you will about treatment and commitment, they argued, what this 
comes down to is preventive detention. The people you've targeted are not 
mentally ill, and can't be treated. They're criminals, pure and simple. Some 
are developmentally disabled. You've carved out of thin air a false medical 
diagnosis, as an excuse to hold people indefinitely. It sounds a lot like the 
old, discredited sex psychopathy laws. And how would the detention ever end? 
</P>
<P>
"How many psychiatrists do you know who will go to court and say this guy is 
OK?" asked Dr. James Reardon, a psychiatrist representing the Washington State 
Psychiatric Assn. who works with prisoners and the involuntarily committed. 
"Can you imagine the liability? You are trying to make medical people into 
agents of social control, into policemen . . . . We urge you to accept the 
limitations of science and medical practice. Lock up the rapists, murderers and 
the armed robbers for a long time if you will. But do not commit them for 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a duality here," added John LaFond, Boerner's colleague at the 
University of Puget Sound law school and a specialist in mental health law. 
"First the system treats certain offenders as criminal wrongdoers, in control 
of their actions. Then when their sentence is up, it says he's in need of 
treatment, is not responsible for his actions. I call this 'labeling of 
convenience.' " 
</P>
<P>
If there was substance to the various objections, however, there was also a 
certain tentativeness. In the end, only a handful of those opposed to the sex 
predator bill spoke publicly, and most kept their voices unusually low. 
</P>
<P>
The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, in fact, chose not to 
testify at all during the legislative hearings, concluding it would be 
counterproductive, with emotions running so high. The lone civil liberties 
advocate on the task force, Robert Stalker from Evergreen Legal Services, also 
remained quiet. "My political assessment was there was no point in opposing 
this," he explained later. 
</P>
<P>
One state psychologist, an expert in the sex offender field, said she kept her 
doubts private because her boss supported the proposed bill. A lawyer, asking 
anonymity, said that he'd hesitated even to talk with a reporter, since the 
last time he'd spoken out, he'd received a letter threatening to burn down his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very difficult position we're in now," the public defender, 
Boruchowitz, said. "I mean, no one can be against protecting the community, or 
be for sex predators. Moderate people have been caught up in this mood. I 
hesitate to speak out." 
</P>
<P>
Maleng, Boerner and their colleagues, at any rate, by now had carefully refined 
answers for those who did object. 
</P>
<P>
There's a distinction between the obligation to treat and the likelihood of a 
cure, they pointed out. Besides, even if we can't treat now, shouldn't we keep 
trying? We do that all the time with AIDS and cancer. And we're not asking the 
doctors to predict borderline cases, we're asking them to tell us who are the 
most dangerous of the dangerous. Yes, it's going to be difficult for these 
people to get out, we can't deny that. Some will be in for a long time -- 
perhaps 30 years. Either a person changes or we find a cure. Maybe a treatment 
will be developed much later. What else is a rational society to do -- let them 
go or lock them in prison forever? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sensitive to civil liberties," Maleng said. "That's why we put in 
a full due process procedure. Of the alternatives, life sentences for thousands 
is worse, and letting them go, not possible. I am not concerned that there will 
be abuse -- this system makes it hard on all actors." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the merits of these various opinions, the truth is, they did not 
account for much of the public debate over the proposed legislation. The bill's 
authors just never were particularly occupied with objections from 
psychiatrists and civil libertarians. They had a much more formidable lobby 
bearing down on them. 
</P>
<P>
"The fires we were trying to put out have been more from people who wanted even 
stronger measures," said Paula Jallison, Maleng's administrative assistant. 
"Lots of people were trying to make it tougher. Politicians were jumping on it. 
It was political suicide not to support this." 
</P>
<P>
In many quarters, preventive detention simply was not an offensive notion. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with a holding pen?" asked Ida Ballasiotes. "They're not going to 
be mistreated. It's not a dungeon. They get food. The point is to keep them 
away from society. For how long? Maybe forever . . . . Society likes these 
nice, tidy definitions -- mentally ill, criminal, sane. Well, some of these 
people don't fit these categories. They just attack, repeatedly, over and 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Life sentences without the possibility of parole for a second offense was, in 
the end, among the milder proposals. A bill providing greatly reduced prison 
sentences to sex offenders who agreed to castration was approved by the state 
Senate in mid-February, winning support from a surprising number of mainstream 
political leaders. Legislators said they voted for the measure as a response to 
constituents' demands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time we address the public's concern for safety and not concern for 
criminal rights," said state Sen. Bob McCaslin (R-Olympia). "This bill would be 
something positive . . . ." 
</P>

"Voluntary mutilation is too good for sex offenders," said state Sen. Brad Owen 
(D-Olympia). "It should be mandatory for these creeps. The Constitution was 
never meant to coddle these people, but that's what we use it for." 
</P>
<P>
So at the start of February, when the sex-offender legislation won unanimous 
approval in both houses of the state Legislature, Maleng and Boerner were 
thankful -- not because their bill hadn't been diluted, but because it hadn't 
been toughened. 
</P>
<P>
The morning that representatives in the House were voting, Ida Ballasiotes sat 
in the upper gallery, eyeing the tally board. 
</P>
<P>
"We were watching to see if anyone opposed the bill," she explained later. "We 
were prepared to publicize names of those who voted against it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glad It's Over 
</P>
<P>
Looking back several weeks later, state representative Marlin Appelwick, 
expressing a not uncommon sentiment, said: "I'm damn glad it's over. I can't 
take many like this." Adoption of the sex-offender legislation, however, has 
proven not so much the end of the story but the beginning. The question most 
frequently asked now: Will the law, aimed at the Earl Shriners of the world, 
cast a far wider net than intended? 
</P>
<P>
Maleng calls the law a "rifle shot" and estimates that perhaps 30 or 40 people 
might be targeted a year, out of the 750 sex offenders that Washington releases 
annually. Others, though, point out that 39 different autonomous county 
prosecutors will decide whom to go after, and will have a tough time choosing, 
since no less than 60% of those 750 released sex offenders can be expected to 
reoffend. 
</P>
<P>
"Political pressures will force a wide net," predicts LaFond. "You are 
criticized, not for sending a nondangerous person to treatment centers; you are 
criticized for releasing someone who is dangerous. Prosecutors tell me they'll 
have to file. If they have that power and don't file, there will be hell to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
Recent events in Washington, as it happens, have done little to allay LaFond's 
fears. The bill doesn't go into effect until July 1, but public officials 
already are displaying an unmistakable enthusiasm for its spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Police Chief John Turner in suburban Mountlake Terrace called a 
press conference to warn citizens that a dangerous 18-year-old man, recently 
released from juvenile custody and not suitable for involuntary commitment, was 
now living in their community. Here was a considerably more marginal figure 
than Earl Shriner. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old's record included two convictions on indecent liberties charges 
almost five years before, when he was 14. But he also was the author of a 
detailed written plan to abduct and molest children, discovered by staffers at 
his juvenile detention center. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought: 'Am I going to be the chief of a community that gets information 
like this and doesn't do anything with it?' " Chief Turner later told 
reporters. "How big of a billboard did I need? What am I to do? Am I to take 
that information and file it away?" 
</P>
<P>
Turner's public announcement triggered an avalanche of phone calls to the 
police station -- for two hours, the calls came every 15 to 20 seconds. City 
residents began keeping their children indoors. The school district bought new 
fencing. Within three weeks, county mental health officials had ordered the 
18-year-old to Western State Hospital, deciding he was indeed fit for 
involuntary commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, confidentiality laws make it hard to trace what has happened to 
him, but a prosecutor familiar with the case indicated that he eventually was 
diagnosed a pedophile, which enabled authorities to commit him, involuntarily 
and indefinitely, even though the new law hadn't gone into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Then, early last February, Tacoma Police Chief Ray Fjetland and Pierce County 
prosecutor John Ladenburg at a press conference not only announced the release 
of a "predatory" man who'd just completed serving his maximum sentence, but 
also provided his name and whereabouts. He was, they said, an "extremely 
dangerous, extremely violent" convicted child molester. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, they were describing the wrong man. The person being released, 
they soon had to acknowledge, was not the 53-year-old man they'd identified, 
but his 21-year-old developmentally disabled son, who had juvenile convictions 
for arson, indecent liberties and malicious mischief. The police chief and 
prosecutor stood by their initial warning, though. State officials, they 
explained, had serious concerns about the younger man because of "other 
behavior" that was not described in court files and could not be released 
because of the juvenile confidentiality laws. 
</P>
<P>
Other miscues followed. One day, Tacoma police informed the Oakland Park area 
that a 22-year-old child rapist had been released from prison and was going to 
live in the neighborhood with his father, but the next day the father said he 
had no notion of his son's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
That same week, a Pierce County sheriff, apparently acting on his own, posted 
flyers all over the Eatonville area that listed not only the name of a 
newly-released sexual offender, but also the name, address and phone number of 
the elderly woman who was once his foster mother. For days, the 72-year-old 
woman's phone rang constantly, the calls full of threats and questions. The 
woman didn't know how to respond, since she hadn't seen the man for seven years 
and had no idea where he was. 
</P>
<P>
By early May, state officials had tentatively targeted six particular sex 
offenders, five of them already released, for possible civil commitment when 
the sex predator bill takes effect in July. The screening for candidates had 
been going on since January, explained corrections official Don Moore, although 
state officials were still struggling to fashion an objective, standardized 
procedure to assess risk. "We need something better than a crude eyeballing of 
an individual," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Reactions 
</P>
<P>
Watching all this, people understandably had differing reactions. 
</P>
<P>
The psychiatrist James Reardon wished citizens would focus their outraged 
concern on what he felt were far bigger threats to society than sexual 
predators, such as drugs and alcohol abuse and guns. Physical and sexual abuse 
were far more likely to come from family members than from strange predators, 
after all. "Nine people were shot to death on Seattle streets last week while 
this law was being debated, but no one talks of gun control," he said. "Sex 
predators have become the focus, the bogyman." 
</P>
<P>
The civil liberties lawyers, sounding shaken and isolated, thought the recent 
events proved that striking down protections for the Earl Shriners also lost 
them for other people. "People forget what this country was founded on," 
Boruchowitz said. "It was for the protection of minorities, the accused, the 
powerless. It was to protect against government abuse. We have died for 
protections people are willing to give up." 
</P>
<P>
Others suggested that the new law simply won't work. "The public was sold a 
bill of goods," said LaFond. "I predict mistaken confinement of innocent people 
and extensive victimization still will continue within the community. So we 
will have the worst of both worlds. The fact is, there are limits to how much 
we can protect and make the world safe, even if politicians can't say that. 
This situation starts you thinking why systems have limits -- there usually are 
reasons. I suspect they'll just commit a few at the start, then there will be 
more Shriners. So they will commit larger numbers. There still will be 
Shriners. Then what?" 
</P>
<P>
Even some connected to the task force felt, if not uncertain, at least 
cautious. "There's no question this can be abused," said Dave Boerner. "We 
simply will have to see. But I have faith in juries." Paul Trause, deputy 
secretary of the state Department of Social and Health Services, who served as 
the task force's chief of staff, said: "We are at the edge. We recognize that. 
There were trade-offs." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ida Ballasiotes, surveying all that has unfolded, could not 
help but feel a sense of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter's murderer, Gene Kane, has been put behind bars for good, 
sentenced to life without possibility of parole. Just hours before the 
Legislature passed the sex offender act, Earl Shriner had been convicted of 
first-degree rape, assault and attempted murder. On that same day, in another 
courtroom, Gary Minnix had been sentenced to 50 years in prison for his rape of 
the Pierce County woman -- a new judge had decided the retarded Minnix was 
competent to stand trial after all. And Friends of Diane and the Tennis Shoe 
Brigade now were carefully monitoring a variety of other courtrooms, carrying 
with them lists of sexual offenders due to be released soon from prison. 
</P>
<P>
At her Mercer Island home one early February morning, Ida Ballasiotes reflected 
on these matters. Then she produced two letters -- one written by Gov. Gardner 
soon after her daughter's death, the other written by Diane on Mothers Day in 
1988, four months before she was murdered. Ballasiotes held the two sheets 
before her, in separate hands, reading first from one, then the other. "The 
board was required to return Mr. Kane to society" . . . "I love you, and I am 
one lucky gal." Dropping the letters on her kitchen table, she shook her head 
with disdain. 
</P>
<P>
"We have focused attention," Ballasiotes said. "We'll never get a perfect 
system, there still will be Shriners and Kanes, but we're saying, at least do a 
better job than you have been doing. We're saying, use your head, be 
accountable." 
</P>
<P>
No, she replied to a question, they were not yet fully satisfied. They were not 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a good first step," Ballasiotes said. "This was a compromise. 
There's a lot to do yet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PREDATORS LAW 
</P>
<P>
Under a Washington state law that goes into effect July 1, people could be 
confined indefinitely, even past their statutory prison terms, if they are 
found to be "sexual predators." 
</P>
<P>
The law defines a predator as "any person who has been convicted of, or charged 
with a crime of sexual violence and who suffers from a mental abnormality or 
personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts 
of sexual violence." 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, acts of sexual violence include first- and second-degree rape, 
indecent liberties and child molestation. Lesser offenses such as second-degree 
assault and even residential burglary could also be considered to meet the 
definition if they are "determined to have been sexually motivated." 
</P>
<P>
A county prosecutor could seek to confine a person under the law who: 
</P>
<P>
Has been convicted of a sexually violent crime and is nearing the end of a 
criminal sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Has committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile and is about to be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Has been charged with a violent sex offense but has been determined to be 
incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Has been found not guilty of a sex offense by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
A judge would order a 45-day confinement upon receiving the prosecutor's 
request. A trial would be held to determine whether the person is at risk to 
commit a sexual crime and should be confined. Confinement would end only upon 
proof that the "predator" was cured.

YOUTHS WITH DESIGNS ON TOMORROW'S CARS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: STUDENTS AT A SMALL COLLEGE IN PASADENA GO ON TO NOTEWORTHY 
SUCCESSES AS AUTOMOTIVE DESIGNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the sylvan hills of Pasadena, high above the smog and traffic that ensnarl 
motorists, a group of young car designers is summoned for a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Their mission: Design a vehicle that will enhance the enjoyment of road travel 
through the West. They christen it the Sunset Project. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, the designers reassemble. As Yasushi Kato gets up to speak, 
all eyes turn to his model, made of sculpted clay and painted a lustrous red. 
With its sharp contours that mix space-bubble design with a covered wagon look, 
this vehicle looks ready to blast into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard about the Sunset Project, it reminded me of the Western 
frontier in the 1880s," Kato tells the other designers, some of whom wear 
ponytails, cowboy boots and suits. 
</P>
<P>
"But do Americans today have the frontier spirit?" he continued. "No. . . . 
They are couch potatoes. So why not stop being couch potatoes with my car? It 
has a wild image. It is a car for the neo-frontiersman. It will allow Americans 
to regain their frontier spirit." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't a New Age seminar for burned-out auto executives. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Art Center College of Design, a modest institution of exceptional 
caliber, which industry experts say is quietly turning out half of the car 
designers working in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey last July, the Art Center was ranked the top U.S. school in both 
industrial and graphic design by Wefler &amp; Associates, a design and research 
firm in Evanston, Ill. The Art Center also boasts one of the nation's top car 
design departments, an honor it shares with Detroit's Center for Creative 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as California car culture takes on almost mythic stature among auto 
designers in search of new trends, the Art Center has become one of the 
touchstones of the industry, where car companies go to jump-start the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the few windows we can come through to see American life," said 
Tom Matano, an Art Center alumnus and a vice president of Mazda who heads the 
firm's California design studio. "The sheer energy and passion and power of the 
students and the unrestricted creativity at the Art Center is something you 
can't get in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Executives from Citroen to Toyota regularly make the pilgrimage to the Art 
Center's glass and steel campus -- designed by Southern California architect 
Craig Ellwood in the International style -- in search of new talent and 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
And increasingly, they sponsor "blue sky" projects, in which students are asked 
to dream up new cars or update old ones. A year ago, Volvo flew out its top 
three designers from Goteborg, Sweden, to brief students on a project to design 
a "socially conscious" Volvo for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, seniors designed a Mitsubishi Eclipse for the year 2000. Mitsubishi 
wanted a car that would accommodate business and leisure activities and 
navigate the clotted city streets of the future. Students were told that 60% of 
the buyers would be women. 
</P>
<P>
And the Sunset Project? It was sponsored by Sunset Magazine, a periodical 
devoted to life in the American West. Juniors in advanced transportation design 
competed for $4,500 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
The object of all this is not to produce viable market products, but to let 
firms tap into ideas unfettered by corporate ideology, said Ron Hill, the 
chairman of the Art Center's industrial design department and one of General 
Motors' chief designers for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
Blue sky projects also give individual students a chance to impress future 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm up there every couple months either interviewing or visiting, and I find 
it stimulating," said Thomas Tremont, an Art Center alumnus and chief designer 
at Chrysler Pacifica, the car company's design studio in Carlsbad, Calif. 
"Young student designers don't have the constraints that working for a company 
can give you." 
</P>
<P>
Students go from paper sketches to computer modeling and, finally, to clay 
models built to one-fifth scale and painted with real automotive colors. They 
even test the aerodynamic capabilities of their model cars in a wind tunnel. 
Design projects run from $25,000 to $50,000 depending on their size and 
complexity. But firms consider it a cheap investment. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Center produced three of the five designers of the Mazda Miata -- one 
of the most critically acclaimed car designs of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
And the Art Center is where Japanese car companies, such as Nissan, Mazda and 
Honda, send their promising young designers to percolate in unbridled freedom 
and creativity -- the antithesis of corporate Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a student now, not a designer. I can do anything I want and that is very 
fun for me," said Kato, 34, one of the top designers for Toyota Motors of 
Japan. He is studying transportation design at the Art Center for a year at the 
behest of his employer. 
</P>
<P>
The pollination goes both ways: Japanese firms are now hiring the Art Center's 
best students to design in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Center's links to Japan were forged in the early 1970s, when the 
Japanese saw California as a safe oasis from the hostility generated by 
large-scale automotive industry layoffs in Detroit, said Carl Olsen, chairman 
of transportation design at the Center for Creative Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda's Matano, who came to the Art Center from Japan in the 1970s, said the 
school taught him to translate his engineering ideas into drawings and 3-D 
models. He said it was a rigorous process. 
</P>
<P>
"The school was so hard; you're never going to face more than that," said 
Matano, who along with the better-known designer Mark Jordan helped design the 
Miata. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the 90 students majoring in transportation design -- out of a total 
student body at the Art Center of 1,150 -- are told to forget about their 
social life for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"The commitment is quite total," said Hill, an alumnus. "We don't have a 
basketball team. We don't have fraternities or sororities. It's incredibly 
difficult, but if you get through the program, it marks a student for life as 
far as their design capabilities go." 
</P>
<P>
Graduates don't walk out of the Art Center as superstars; they earn an average 
starting salary of about $35,000 per year in the United States and up to 
$45,000 in Europe, Hill said. But exceptional students are sometimes wooed by 
several firms at once. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, car companies "are just wailing for women," Hill said. Only three of 
the Art Center's 90 transportation design students are female, but car 
companies hope their numbers will increase because they think female designers 
can dream up automotive styles that women like. 
</P>
<P>
Art Center teaches a more international style of design than Detroit's Center 
for Creative Studies, Hill said. The Japanese influence is very strong, and 
students are encouraged to spend a term studying at the Art Center's other 
campus in Vevey, Switzerland. Many also take a term off to work car company 
internships. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, chairman of transportation design at the Detroit center, said his school 
also maintains strong ties with European firms. He challenges the assumption 
that the Center for Creative Studies teaches "a Detroit world view" and is 
skeptical of the importance of California design. 
</P>
<P>
"The California niche influence is rather peripheral," Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Art Center students in turn speak disparagingly of Detroit. Many don't 
want to work there. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Triano, 24, who is attending the Art Center on a Ford Motor Co. 
scholarship, calls U.S. car companies "large, obese animals that are moving 
much too slowly." He adds that "it's very frustrating. Because we'd like to see 
American companies succeed." 
</P>
<P>
In between finals last year, several students hung around the classroom and 
boasted good-naturedly that they soon would outshine even the designers of the 
Miata. 
</P>
<P>
Many had been up for several nights, putting finishing touches on their models. 
After their presentations, several students lay like slabs of meat across 
classroom tables, exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
After Christmas break, they would be back for more, living out the fantasies of 
every boy who ever doodled the outline of his favorite roadster on a PeeChee 
folder. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Ogden, who teaches advanced transportation design, gestures toward the 
sleek models inspired by the Sunset Project. Some have soft, rounded edges. 
Others are less contoured, more aggressive. They range in color from turquoise 
to purple and red. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the pieces probably will not turn into usable designs," Ogden said. 
"But from them may sprout the seed of an idea."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON IN SHADOWS AS DEMOCRATS SLUG IT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Wilson travels through the sweet rural towns and congested urban 
monstrosities of California as effortlessly as a torpedo slices through calm 
waters. Traveling north and south with precision, the expected Republican 
nominee for governor glides across territory made familiar by his successful 
bids for U.S. Senate: Pasadena to Marysville, Costa Mesa to El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
But with attentions riveted for now on the down-to-the-wire Democratic contest 
between Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de Kamp, Pete Wilson has been 
relegated to the shadows. Earlier this week, he finally got some notice -- but 
he had to harshly criticize the real news makers, Feinstein and Van de Kamp -- 
to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, shaking hands with a few Republican loyalists in a Northern California 
park the other day, professed not to be bothered. 
</P>
<P>
"Plenty of time for that," Wilson says about public attention, adding a wry 
observation about the Democratic race: "There's some attention you'd rather not 
have." 
</P>
<P>
But tellingly, Wilson felt compelled to send biographical commercials onto the 
airwaves two weeks ago to remind voters who he is -- and that he is running. An 
aide said later that the campaign could not afford not to issue the reminder. 
</P>
<P>
It is the stuff of a politician's dreams and nightmares, to be left unblemished 
by the mayhem of a primary yet to be denied the free publicity that has come 
Feinstein's and Van de Kamp's way. 
</P>
<P>
There are no illusions that Wilson, 56, will stay quiet for long. A campaign 
operative for an opponent physically shudders at the bombardment Wilson is 
expected to loose against the winning Democrat the day after the election. 
</P>
<P>
"Hiroshima," he said, describing the expected blast in nuclear terms. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Wilson has bounded about freely, raising money to add to the $3 
million he has on hand and -- when time and events permit -- making occasional 
stabs at his rivals. In the process the senator has sought to press anew the 
image he crafted during the last eight years in Washington, that of a pragmatic 
and moderate Republican unfettered by the more hard-line positions espoused by 
others in his party. 
</P>
<P>
Standing Tuesday in front of an El Cajon home that houses drug-addicted mothers 
and their children, Wilson sounded more like a Democratic outsider than a man 
who has spent years climbing the Republican political ladder. The federal 
government -- controlled for the last 10 years by Republican administrations -- 
has done an "abysmal" job of preventing drug abuse, he said. He added that 
federal health projects involving pregnant addicts had been "minor league" in 
their funding. 
</P>
<P>
"These women need help," he said. "What we should have done in the first place 
as a society is to prevent their becoming addicted. Having failed to do that, 
the next step is to prevent them from having another addicted newborn." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was touting a $300-million proposal he has authored to increase 
treatment facilities for pregnant drug abusers, teach doctors and nurses how to 
spot addicted babies, and increase foster care placements for babies born 
addicted. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance was technically billed as a senatorial press conference -- not 
one paid for by his campaign for governor -- but it was illustrative of the 
techniques he will use in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to young and apprehensive mothers, days and weeks into drug abuse 
recovery, he listened almost awkwardly as they told their stories. He asked few 
questions, and seemed to connect more personally with the babies than with 
their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"She won't do anything at all for a while besides sleep," he chuckled nervously 
to a mother who apologized that her 5-day-old daughter slept through Wilson's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, when the television camera rolled, Wilson repeated the mothers' 
stories almost word for word -- personalizing a pitch that could have glazed 
the eyes had it dwelt on abuse statistics and federally funded training 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson admitted that the money he was proposing was minuscule compared to 
the demand for treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, I don't think I could get more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all events run so smoothly or draw the television and radio coverage of the 
El Cajon appearance. On Sunday in Marysville, Wilson drove up to a Republican 
Party picnic to find a dozen adults and two little girls in party finery eating 
chicken and macaroni salad. 
</P>
<P>
An hour before he arrived, with the size of the crowd even smaller, two of the 
picnickers grabbed the microphone and speakers set up for Wilson's speech and 
bundled them into a car. Wilson ultimately shook hands with the attendees and 
left without making any formal remarks. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymity disappeared the next morning, when Wilson slammed Feinstein -- 
and to a lesser extent Van de Kamp -- in a speech to the California Peace 
Officers Assn. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Feinstein advertisements in which she is billed as the "only 
Democratic candidate for governor who is for the death penalty," Wilson accused 
her of being a campaign convert to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
"What I am saying is that if this (Feinstein's death penalty posture) has been 
a long-held passion, it has been well-concealed," Wilson declared. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rather surprised by the senator's hyperbole," Feinstein snapped back. "I 
think he must be getting a little frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls, including a state survey conducted by The Times, show Wilson in a 
virtual dead heat with either Feinstein or Van de Kamp. Political experts have 
long suggested that the senator might have a tougher time beating back a 
challenge by Feinstein, whose positions are closer to Wilson's than are Van de 
Kamp's. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's current campaign commercial covers essentially the same themes that 
the two Democrats have battled over in their primary -- the environment, 
growth, the death penalty, education. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to remind people of the visionary leadership we think Wilson 
has demonstrated over 24 years of public life," said campaign director Otto 
Bos. 
</P>
<P>
Bos denies that campaign officials are concerned about Wilson's relatively low 
profile throughout the primary campaign. Rather, they say the ads are necessary 
because Californians need to be reminded of the candidate's positions. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're living in a state of 30 million people, you're obliged to tell it 
again and again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson plans to return to Washington for two weeks during the close of the 
primary campaign, when attention will be drawn to two Democratic debates and 
the last-ditch exchanges between Feinstein and Van de Kamp. Then he will be 
back in California with what is expected to be a fierce assault on the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the primary is over, we're still a third force," said Bos. "Their jig is 
up in four weeks."

LONELY PROP. 120 FOES SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO NEW PRISONS

<P>
In this busy primary election season, Emma Childers, a lobbyist for the Friends 
Committee on Legislation, has to be one of the loneliest people around. 
</P>
<P>
She has some allies, to be sure, in her fight to defeat Proposition 120, the 
$450-million prison bond issue on the June 5 ballot. But her phone isn't 
exactly ringing off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Gov. George Deukmejian and members of the Legislature who 
put Proposition 120 on the ballot have history and what seems like the 
unshakeable support of California voters on their side. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking last week to 1,100 people attending a luncheon of the California 
Federation of Republican Women, Deukmejian ran down a list of propositions he 
wanted GOP women to vote for and failed to mention the prison bond measure. 
Probably because he knew he didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
Voters have never rejected a prison bond issue. The last one, an $817-million 
bond issue in the November, 1988, election, passed with 60% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Mervin Field, who runs the California Poll, said, "We haven't seen any 
weakening in the public's desire to put 'em away, or, if they are guilty of 
brutal, heinous crimes, to execute them. The public is in a very punitive mood. 
They are for more and more incarceration. Those are very strong feelings." 
</P>
<P>
But that does not deter Childers, whose Quaker group has opposed other prison 
construction bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
She and other opponents of Proposition 120 are firmly convinced that the money 
being used to build more prisons could be better spent on rehabilitation and 
drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
To the degree that there is any kind of debate over Proposition 120, it centers 
on the question of whether alternatives to incarceration should be pursued, an 
issue that takes on a measure of urgency because of the huge numbers of 
prisoners entering the state penal system. 
</P>
<P>
When the primary ballot was put together earlier this year, there were 88,000 
prisoners in the state's 19 correctional facilities. By April, the number of 
inmates had grown to 90,813. And the state Department of Corrections estimates 
that by 1995 there will be 153,370 adults in California's prisons. 
</P>
<P>
All those prisoners will need to be housed somewhere, and that is what 
Proposition 120 is all about. Of the $450 million it is designed to raise, $194 
million will go for a 2,200-bed prison being built in north Imperial County. 
The rest will go to buy land and construct, remodel or maintain various other 
youth and adult correctional facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the increased prison population has come since Deukmejian, one of the 
sponsors of Proposition 120, took office in 1983. When he was sworn in, there 
were 34,640 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Under Deukmejian -- the father of the state's death penalty law and supporter 
of the numerous new laws to stiffen sentences that are said to have triggered 
the huge jump in the prison population -- construction of six prisons has been 
completed, major expansions were undertaken on six others, and ground has been 
broken or plans drawn up for nine more. 
</P>
<P>
Still on tap, for future bond issues, are two prisons in Los Angeles County, 
others in Wasco and Delano, a women's prison in Madera County near Chowchilla, 
a second prison in Imperial County and one in Coalinga. 
</P>
<P>
State officials figure that even if Proposition 120 is approved, the prison 
system will need at least $4 billion more over the next five years to keep up 
with increases in inmate populations. Since 1980, the Legislature has asked 
voters to approve $3 billion in prison construction bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent figures show that most of the growth in inmate populations has 
been in the area of nonviolent crimes, such as theft of property and 
drug-related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1989, 41.8% of those in state prisons were there for violent 
crimes; 28% for crimes against property, such as burglary or car theft; 25.6% 
for drug-related offenses, such as possession for sale, and the remaining 4.5% 
for such things as parole violation, arson or driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
The characteristics of the prison population have changed substantially since 
Deukmejian took office. At that time, 61.7% of all prisoners were there for 
violent crimes and only 6.2% were doing time for drug-related offenses. The 
other categories were about the same as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
Childers points to the figures and says: "We oppose more prison construction as 
long as we have more than half of the people in prison today there for 
nonviolent offenses. They could be in community correction centers that would 
cost less money." 
</P>
<P>
She argues that whether the prisoners are violent or nonviolent, most suffer 
from alcohol or drug addiction and that the drugs played some role in their 
crimes. "All these drug addicts should be treated. It doesn't make sense to put 
them in prison and then let them come right out with their same addictions. 
They only end up right back in prison. There are numerous alternatives to 
prisons that are less costly and more effective to reducing recidivism," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting one of her arguments is a study by the state legislative analyst 
published in February that found that "76% of state prison inmates have a 
history of substance abuse." The analyst quoted a U.S. Department of Justice 
study of county prisons that produced estimates that 48% of convicted persons 
had used alcohol before committing their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1989-90 state budget year, the analyst estimated that the state 
spent $500 million, or about one-quarter of the Department of Corrections' 
budget of $2 billion, incarcerating drug offenders in state prisons. In 
contrast, the state spent only $1.5 million on treatment programs for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that lawmakers are listening to such arguments, although the 
trend toward building more prisons is expected to continue in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), the chief legislative sponsor of Proposition 
120, said, "We are trying to figure out ways to put more nonviolent offenders 
in community-based programs. I agree that we don't have to house some of these 
people in expensive state prison cells. On the other hand, as the population of 
California keeps growing -- some estimates are that we will be growing by 
700,000 to 750,000 persons a year -- we know that a large number of those 
people are going to be involved in criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
In the November general election, Presley, the governor and others are going to 
ask voters to approve a second $450-million prison construction bond measure.

POPE LECTURES CAPITALISTS ABOUT POVERTY

<TEXT>
<P>
A scolding Pope John Paul II warned Mexican businessmen Wednesday that they 
have no cause to celebrate the collapse of communism if their own capitalist 
system generates more wealth for a few and greater poverty for the many. 
</P>
<P>
Welcoming, cheering Roman Catholics lined the papal motorcade route with waving 
flags for nine miles in this sere, flat city that was the birthplace of Mexican 
revolutionary Pancho Villa. 
</P>
<P>
The papal warning came in a stern lecture on economic and social justice 
directed at all well-to-do Latin Americans, and by extension to the industrial 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The excessive hoarding of riches by some deprives the majority of them. Thus, 
the very wealth that is accumulated generates poverty," John Paul told the 
business audience in this state capital of 600,000 in west-central Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest speech of John Paul's Mexican visit included his most specific 
appraisal of the economic consequences of revolutionary change in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of communism, it would be wrong, the Pope said, to conclude 
that capitalism "is the only road for our world . . . rejecting critical 
judgments of the impact (that) liberal capitalism has produced, at least until 
now, on countries of the so-called Third World." 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia last month, John Paul hailed the end of communism's "tragic 
Utopia" in Eastern Europe. On Wednesday, though, he stressed that his church's 
concern is not with economic systems as such but with applications of them that 
"violate or endanger human dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case in Mexico, John Paul said, where great wealth and opulent 
lifestyles exist alongside the suffering of "great majorities deprived of the 
most basic resources." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's fourth day in Mexico carried him through searing heat for a grinding 
12 hours in corn-and-cattle Durango state. He preached love and hope to inmates 
at a model prison and ordained 100 priests at an elaborate outdoor Mass here. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul surprised officials at the carefully groomed, 1,200-inmate Durango 
Penitentiary, where hundreds of prisoners waited behind a newly fenced compound 
separating them from the altar. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope asked to be let into the compound. Nervously, prison officials 
unlocked the gate, and for about 15 minutes the pontiff waded slowly among the 
prisoners while an inmate band played an off-key rendition of the "Ode to Joy" 
from Beethoven's 9th Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Strolling as though he had all the time in the world, the Pope moved patiently 
to the farthest reaches of the fenced compound, shaking hands with prisoners 
and speaking with them briefly. Many knelt and kissed his ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this visit will bring us luck in getting out early," said Pedro 
Graciano, 50, a father of 10 who has served 30 months of a 16-year sentence for 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst of prisons is a heart closed and hardened, the worst of ills is 
desperation. I wish you hope," the Pope told the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Today, John Paul will visit Chihuahua and Monterrey.

MILITARY: MINISTERS DISCUSS DEFENSE OFFICIALS' FINDINGS -- THAT IT WOULD BE 
SAFE TO CURB SHORT-RANGE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

In the wake of an agreement limiting non-nuclear forces in Europe, an attacking 
army of Soviet troops would have so far to march and would arrive so 
thinned-out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can safely dispense 
with most of its short-range nuclear weapons, senior NATO defense officials 
have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary findings were presented to NATO defense ministers here 
Wednesday in the draft of a study prepared by the alliance's "High-Level Group" 
-- officials from 15 allied nations responsible for nuclear policy. Its 
findings were among the first matters discussed as the ministers opened two 
days of meetings here on the future of nuclear weapons in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The report is expected to shape NATO's position on pursuing negotiations with 
the Soviets to reduce or eliminate each side's force of short-range, 
ground-launched nuclear weapons. President Bush called for the acceleration of 
such negotiations last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In their first day of meetings, however, allies here clashed about the aim of 
those talks. West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he found 
"wide support for the German position that the clear aim of these negotiations 
should be the removal of all land-based systems of the United States and the 
Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
But a senior British official said his government opposes the proposal that 
elimination rather than the reduction of those missiles should be NATO's goal. 
American officials in Washington have said the Administration is willing to 
accept a ban on the missiles in Europe. At the NATO meeting, however, U.S. 
defense officials argued against publicly defining any stance as an opening 
position in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg said Wednesday that those negotiations could begin as soon as 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The West German defense minister joined his Dutch counterpart, Relus ter Beek, 
in urging the alliance unilaterally to withdraw nuclear artillery shells from 
Europe and to ask the Soviet Union to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
There was a "general feeling" within the alliance that the nuclear shells, most 
of which are deployed in West Germany, can be eliminated, Dutch Ambassador to 
NATO Adrian Jacobovits said. 
</P>
<P>
With agreement now being finalized to cut conventional forces in Europe, the 
report presented to defense ministers explores the implications for NATO's 
nuclear needs. An American official said the study, commissioned six months 
ago, strongly suggests that even after negotiated reductions, some ground-based 
nuclear missiles should remain in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance defense chiefs are expected to conclude the two-day meeting today.

RED ARMY GETS A DAY IN SUN TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE MILITARY ALSO GETS A CHANCE TO AIR ITS VIEWS ABOUT SECURITY 
AND THE UPHEAVALS SPARKED BY PERESTROIKA.

<P>
The Soviet military got its day in the sun Wednesday for an impressive flexing 
of its military muscle on Red Square and the airing of its views about security 
matters and the social upheavals sparked by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
With Gorbachev, who is also Soviet commander in chief, and the Politburo 
watching, the military held a spit-and-polish parade outside the Kremlin to 
mark both the 45th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat and the current role of 
the armed forces, now under unprecedented attack from radicals, reformers and 
local separatists. 
</P>
<P>
Public response to simultaneous Victory Day parades in the independence-minded 
Baltic republics -- where the 4-million-strong Soviet armed forces are looked 
upon as occupiers rather than wartime liberators by many -- showed the degree 
to which opinion is now polarized. 
</P>
<P>
In Riga, Latvia's capital, as many as 10,000 people, many of whom were Russians 
or from other non-Latvian ethnic groups, gathered on a river embankment to 
cheer the parading soldiers and demonstrate against the republic's declaration 
last Friday proclaiming restoration of Latvian independence. 
</P>
<P>
In Lithuania, where Soviet troops have seized buildings and manhandled 
deserters since the republic's proclamation of independence from Moscow in 
March, youths in the capital city of Vilnius whistled in contempt at the 
soldiers and derided them as "occupiers." A group of protesters reportedly 
tried to block the parade but were dislodged by paratroopers. 
</P>
<P>
In Estonia, many elected officials shunned their republic's parade. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny but cool day in Moscow, more than 12,000 troops from the ground 
forces, navy, air force, KGB border guards and Interior Ministry high-stepped 
across Red Square with eyes trained on the nation's leadership assembled atop 
Lenin's mausoleum. That was the same spot where Kremlin leaders were standing 
last week when thousands of Muscovites jeered them during the May Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
Rows of T-34 tanks, considered by many Western experts to be the best any 
nation produced in World War II, ground across the cobblestones, belching blue 
clouds of exhaust fumes, as a tribute to the victors in the Soviets' "Great 
Patriotic War." 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet Union also revealed its newest battle tank and other items of 
military hardware never before put on display. 
</P>
<P>
To render further homage to the 27 million Soviets said to have perished in the 
four-year struggle against the Nazis, a graying group of World War II veterans, 
partisans and underground fighters strode across the cobbles, their medals 
gleaming and bouncing off their chests. 
</P>
<P>
To incarnate the Soviet army's vision of itself as a wartime liberator, and not 
a subjugator as many Balts or East Europeans would contend, a soldier armed 
with a sword stood atop a float, cradling a little girl as if to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
The pair, reproducing the image of a Soviet victory monument in East Berlin, 
waited frozen in their poses for at least at hour before the parade got under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said veterans it interviewed want the 
monument brought home from Berlin's Treptow Park, where it presumably might 
disappear in the process of German unification, to be erected in western Moscow 
as the Soviet capital's victory monument. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute march-past and related ceremonies were interpreted by Moscow 
diplomats as the latest of a series of gestures by the Soviet leadership to the 
military, which is now seeing its ranks thinned by half a million men. The 
armed forces also feel multiplying pressures to cut costs and mounting press 
criticism and public opposition as a result of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The Victory Day parade, the first since 1985, "is a shot in the arm for those 
who want to show their pride," said U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock, who 
watched from the VIP gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, in a speech before the start of the parade, 
voiced the military's concerns over the current course taken by Soviet domestic 
and foreign policy, although he explicitly pledged the armed forces' loyalty to 
Communist Party policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the influence of the deep transformations in the Soviet Union, there 
have been positive changes in international life," Yazov said. "Dialogue is 
taking the place of confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"However, these positive changes are not yet irreversible," he said, speaking 
from the mausoleum with Gorbachev next to him. "The military danger still 
remains. In these conditions, the Soviet Union maintains its defense capability 
at the necessary and sufficient level and is carrying out a radical 
transformation of its defense structure, all of which constitutes military 
reform." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev had no visible reaction, Yazov's assessment of the 
international scene was notably more cautious than the phrasing that the 
country's civilian rulers are now using as a May 30 superpower summit in 
Washington draws near. 
</P>
<P>
State-run Soviet television, during its live broadcast of the parade, commented 
that the world is expecting much from the summit and said the main goal of 
Soviet foreign policy is to negotiate a halving of the superpower strategic 
arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov also spoke of the Soviet people's "unshakable faith" in communism and the 
"mighty possibilities of the socialist organization of industry and 
agriculture." Gorbachev and his allies, in contrast, are stressing the need for 
rapid implementation of elements of a capitalist market to rescue the nation's 
reeling and shortage-plagued economy. 
</P>
<P>
The defense minister, who is a non-voting member of the Politburo, also voiced 
concern over the breakdown in inter-ethnic relations that has fueled resistance 
to compulsory military service in the Baltic and Caucasus republics and, in the 
case of Armenia and Azerbaijan, led to virtual civil warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"The war convincingly showed the stability of the Soviet state structure, the 
indestructibility of the fraternal friendship of the peoples of our country," 
Yazov said. "It confirmed that not apart, not alone, but only in a tight union, 
under mutual respect, help and collaboration, can woes and difficulties be 
overcome." 
</P>
<P>
According to NATO military attaches, Soviet equipment shown for the first time 
Wednesday included a variation of the T-80 tank and the BMD-2 airborne combat 
vehicle, which is armed with a tank-killer missile.

About 10,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from a punctured barge early Wednesday 
into a heavily industrialized waterway between New York's Staten Island and New 
Jersey, the Coast Guard reported. 
</P>
<P>
The spill at the GATX terminal on the Arthur Kill, site of about half a dozen 
spills this year, was reported by workers on the barge owned by Victoria 
Transportation of Elizabeth, the guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers had been pumping unleaded gasoline onto the barge for several hours 
before realizing there was a hole beneath the water line, said George Lowman, a 
spokesman for GATX. 
</P>
<P>
The waterway was reopened after about five hours when most of the gasoline had 
either evaporated or dispersed.

A jury on Wednesday found a man guilty of trying to poison the historic Treaty 
Oak, a centuries-old tree that was severely damaged by the powerful herbicide 
Velpar. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Stedman Cullen, 46, faces a possible life sentence because of a prior 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
He has been jailed since his arrest in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
State District Judge Bob Perkins scheduled sentencing for today. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claimed Cullen used the herbicide to poison the live oak tree in a 
ritual apparently designed to end his affection for his counselor at a 
methadone clinic. Foresters say at least half of the oak is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The giant oak, estimated to be 500 years old, reportedly was the site of a 
treaty signing between Stephen F. Austin and Indians in the 1820s.

A THIRD OF VALDEZ SPILL AREA STILL OILY

Oil still fouls one-third of the beaches hit by last year's Exxon Valdez spill, 
according to reports Wednesday by the oil company and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Oil was found on 358.3 miles of shoreline during a survey of 1,062 miles of 
beaches struck by oil last year in Prince William Sound, the Kenai Peninsula 
and Kodiak Island, Exxon said in a progress report to federal and state cleanup 
coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the shores are lightly oiled. 
</P>
<P>
An assessment by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration supported 
the Exxon analysis even though the numbers differed slightly, apparently 
because Exxon was faster than the government in processing data sent in by 
beach survey crews, said Burl Wescott of the NOAA. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska spill coordinator Randy Bayliss said the state had no dispute with the 
findings of how much oil remained.

TOUGHER ALASKA OIL SPILL BILLS DIE IN LEGISLATURE 
</P>

Amid heavy lobbying from the oil industry, a package of reforms to prevent a 
repeat of the Exxon Valdez oil spill took a battering in the final hours of 
Alaska's legislative session that ended early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
As legislators at the state Capitol in Juneau adjourned for the year, a 
collection of bills emerged that Gov. Steve Cowper and other state officials 
said will make another massive oil spill in Alaska waters less likely. 
</P>
<P>
But two tougher regulatory reforms, endorsed by the governor and a state 
commission that investigated the Exxon spill, died in the final hours of the 
session following an aggressive campaign by the oil industry to defeat them. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of what we wanted," said Cowper. "We got about two-thirds of what 
we wanted. But I would have preferred to have gotten the stronger bills that we 
introduced. But there was an extremely heavy presence in the Legislature by the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Among the five bills that passed were measures improving spill cleanup 
contingency planning, raising the financial liability limit for spillers and 
increasing the criminal penalties for the negligent operation of oil tankers. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure considered the keystone of the package of "spill bills" died in 
a committee of the conservative Republican-controlled state Senate late 
Tuesday. It would have given the Department of Environmental Conservation more 
power to enforce existing state regulations, including allowing surprise 
inspections of designated oil facilities and allowing fines of up to $15,000 a 
day to stop illegal practices. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry labeled the measure the "Gestapo bill," contending it gave the 
government too much power. Oil lobbyists mobilized opposition from mining, 
timber and other resource industries. 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives said Wednesday they were generally pleased with the 
bills that passed. And senators -- criticized by the Democratic governor and 
House members for standing in the way of oil spill reforms -- defended their 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what passed was responsible," said Sen. Drue Pearce (R-Anchorage), 
chairman of the Senate Oil and Gas Committee. "We took into account the 
concerns of all the parties. It was an amazingly open process." 
</P>
<P>
Pearce, like other legislators, said the package will make another huge spill 
more difficult.

FAULTY COOLING SYSTEM DELAYS COLUMBIA LAUNCH 
</P>

The shuttle Columbia's planned launch next week on a Spacelab astronomy flight 
will be delayed "two to three weeks" because of work to replace a balky cooling 
system valve, NASA officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The launch delay was announced by William Lenoir, associate administrator for 
space flight, at the conclusion of a two-day flight readiness review. Liftoff 
for the 36th shuttle flight had been scheduled for next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously disappointed that we are not ready to fly," Lenoir said. 
"However, this particular system is absolutely critical to the safety of the 
crew and overall mission success, so we have decided to change the component." 
</P>
<P>
NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said his only concern was making sure the 
shuttle is safe for flight. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody remembers the century that Galileo looked at the planet Jupiter (and) 
nobody's going to care whether we fly on a Tuesday or Thursday. I look at this 
mission the same way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary repair schedule showed that Columbia would not be ready for 
blastoff until at least May 30, two weeks later than planned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to take two to three weeks," launch director Robert Sieck 
said. "This is straight-forward work but it is tedious; it has a high degree of 
difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is one of access. Engineers have never attempted such a repair job 
inside the shuttle's 60-foot payload bay with the spaceplane in the vertical 
launch position. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement poses a major threat to Columbia's next mission, a Spacelab 
flight set for launch in late August, because of an already-tight processing 
schedule and a high-priority flight Oct. 5 to launch a European probe to 
Jupiter and the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia and its seven-member crew are to study X-ray and ultraviolet radiation 
from deep space that is blocked by Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers say the mission will provide new information about the physical 
makeup of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's crew -- in what will probably be a post-Challenger record -- plans 
to spend at least nine and possibly 10 days in orbit to study the high-energy 
astronomical targets.

HOSTAGES' RELEASE GRABS PUBLIC'S INTEREST; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS: 46% PAID 'VERY CLOSE' ATTENTION TO THE DEVELOPMENTS. THE STORIES RECEIVED 
MORE NOTICE THAN ANY OTHER SO FAR THIS YEAR, ACCORDING TO A SURVEY.

<P>
The release of American hostages in the Middle East attracted nearly 50% more 
attention than any other news story this year, according to a monthly survey of 
public reaction to the news. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of those surveyed, 46%, said they paid "very close" attention to 
the release of hostages Robert Polhill and Frank H. Reed, the first time this 
year that more than a third of the public closely followed any story, according 
to the Times Mirror News Interest Index. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on interviews with 1,218 adults nationwide between May 3 and 
May 7, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
The results also may be influenced by the wording of questions and the way they 
are asked. 
</P>
<P>
Survey participants also said they considered the hostages' release the "most 
important" news event in April, the first time this year that they did not rate 
changes in Eastern and Central Europe as most important. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Day was the second most closely followed story in April at 31%. It was 
particularly interesting to readers under the age of 30, in contrast to the 
hostage release, which tended to interest readers over 50. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing clash between Lithuania and the Soviet Union was the third 
most-followed story -- 27%, about equal with previous months -- followed by the 
launch of the Hubble Space Telescope at 24%, problems with taking the 1990 
census, 24%, news of rising inflation and interest rates, 18%, May Day protests 
in Moscow, 9%, and civil war in Cambodia, 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the survey found once again that readers and viewers often take 
from the news what they think they need, without closely following the details. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, 88% said they had heard about the death of teen-age AIDS victim 
Ryan White and about 75% said they knew about the decision by major tuna fish 
canners to require more protection for dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Six in 10 of those surveyed had heard about British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher's decline in popularity and knew that the Soviet Union had cut off 
fuel supplies to Lithuania. More than half knew about the controversy in 
Cincinnati over an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's photography. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also suggested that some members of the so-called "Keating Five" in 
the U.S. Senate are being hurt worse than others by the controversy over 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. The five senators allegedly intervened with 
regulators on behalf of Lincoln and its owner, Charles H. Keating, who was a 
large contributor to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 11% could name Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) as one member of 
the group, while 8% could cite Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). But "virtually no 
one," according to the survey's authors, could name the other three: Michigan 
Democrat Donald W. Riegle Jr., 1%, Arizona Democrat Dennis A. DeConcini, 2%, or 
Arizona Republican John McCain, 1%.

INVESTIGATORS SEARCH DESTROYER FOR CLUES TO FATAL FIRE

Naval investigators searched the fire-scarred interior of the guided missile 
destroyer Conyngham on Wednesday in an effort to determine what set off the 
blaze that killed one sailor and injured 18 others. 
</P>
<P>
A team of investigators and Naval Investigative Service agents were 
interviewing crew members and examining the ship. 
</P>
<P>
The fire erupted in one of the Conyngham's four boilers as it was being lit 
during routine maneuvers early Tuesday about 80 miles off North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Paul Hanley, senior public affairs officer for the Atlantic Fleet, said 
the ship was preparing for an inspection when the fire occurred. He did not 
know of any previous mechanical problems aboard the ship. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation will focus on equipment, procedures and events leading up to 
the fire, he said. The investigative team is headed by Capt. Raymond Sharpe 
Jr., commander of Destroyer Squadron 10 in Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
The crippled 437-foot destroyer was towed into Norfolk by the Opportune, a Navy 
salvage ship, early Wednesday morning. About 200 family and friends greeted the 
crew members in what Navy officials called an emotional reunion. 
</P>
<P>
A dark, blistered area on the ship's starboard side bore evidence of the 
roaring fire. One sailor told his mother the flames became so hot that metal 
decks bubbled and firefighting masks on sailors melted. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started in the forward boiler room and was fed by diesel fuel, said 
Capt. Joseph Perrotta Jr., skipper of the Normandy, which assisted the 
Conyngham. 
</P>
<P>
Perrotta praised the Conyngham crew, saying crewmen's firefighting efforts kept 
weapons and ammunition areas cool. At no time was ammunition in danger of being 
set off, he said.

Four people have filed complaints that police used excessive force to quell a 
drunken rampage by 1,000 beer-swilling youths last weekend, Police Chief John 
Bullerjahn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bullerjahn said police will investigate the complaints, but declined to discuss 
details of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed the riot squarely on the 94 people arrested during the two-day clash 
that marred the city's annual spring celebration, Rancho Chico Days. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people to blame for this are those who were arrested," Bullerjahn 
told reporters at a news conference. "I think the community ought to be proud 
of the way the incident was handled. 
</P>
<P>
There were 38 police officers injured in the melee, most by rocks and bottles 
as they tried to disperse the crowd. One officer suffered a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
Butte County Dist. Atty. Mike Ramsey said he had seen no evidence of police 
brutality, but would "certainly look at that issue, just like we would at any 
other."

STATE JOINS ATTACK ON BAN OF CLINICS' ABORTION ADVICE

Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said Wednesday he has asked the U.S. Supreme 
Court on behalf of California to hear a challenge to federal rules that 
prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from mentioning abortion or 
abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said his office accepted an invitation from the states of New York 
and Ohio to join a request to the high court attacking the regulations, enacted 
in February, 1988, under the Reagan Administration, as a violation of the 
rights of privacy and free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. M. Anne Jennings said the regulations ban any clinic 
receiving federal family planning funds from using money from any source in a 
program that mentions abortion as an option. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics are also forbidden to refer women to health care providers who 
regularly perform abortions, and are required to provide a list of every local 
prenatal care provider that does not perform abortions, regardless of the 
clinic's opinion of the provider's competence, Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Van de Kamp's office views the regulations as an unauthorized 
expansion of a longstanding federal law that prohibited the direct use of 
federal funds to pay for abortions "as a method of family planning."

IS IT THE ROAD TO RUIN OR THE FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS?; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: VISTA HIGH SCHOOL CONSIDERS WHETHER TO CUT BACK ON THE PRACTICE OF 
GROUPING STUDENTS ACCORDING TO SKILL LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers at Vista High School could face a fundamental change when the school 
board meets tonight to consider curtailing the practice of grouping students of 
similar skill levels into separate classes, commonly known as tracking. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, longtime teacher Jim Jordan says the change would force him and 
his colleagues to teach at one ability level or another. 
</P>
<P>
"You are then forced to either teach to the top end of the class, they do well 
and the other end of the class fails, or you teach to the lower end and let the 
top guys take care of themselves," Jordan said. "In any case, you're doing a 
disservice to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, proponents of the change question the philosophy of 
tracking, saying it denies large number of students -- especially minorities -- 
access to the best curriculum and a chance for education beyond high school. 
</P>
<P>
"What the research shows is that higher track kids, when they're moved into 
mixed groups, do as well as they've always done, and the lower track kids do 
much better," said Bruce Harter, principal at Vista High. 
</P>
<P>
The Vista Unified School District will decide the issue tonight when it takes 
up a school development plan for Vista High that would reduce the number of 
tracks there from four to three. 
</P>
<P>
Vista High now has an honors track, a college preparatory track (called A), a 
less 
</P>
<P>
rigorous track for students not going to college (B) and a remedial track (C). 
The proposal would collapse tracks A and B in the 10th grade to form one 
college-prep track. The results would be evaluated at the end of the first 
year, and could lead to reduced tracking in the 11th and 12th grades. 
</P>
<P>
Students could choose which track they go into, and could switch tracks at any 
time in their high school careers. 
</P>
<P>
But some teachers place little value on the research cited by Harter, 
preferring to rely on their experience, which they say shows obstacles to 
teaching a class of students with mixed ability levels. 
</P>
<P>
"You are looking at students coming to the ninth grade who have never passed an 
English class, and all of a sudden they're going to have to deal with a more 
rigorous curriculum?" said Jordan, a 16-year veteran of English teaching at 
Vista High, who supports the current system. 
</P>
<P>
But Don Phillips, associate superintendent of the Vista district, said, "We 
assume that until (these students) have any of those kind of fundamental 
skills, there's no way they can do some of these higher-order kinds of 
activities, which really sets an academic tone that doesn't challenge or 
stimulate or involve the students. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in the honors-level programs and college prep is that we ask the 
kids to think, discuss and apply their knowledge. Oftentimes in the B and C 
tracks, you don't have that kind of creative activity, we tend to be more rote 
with more mechanical kinds of activities, things that are deadly boring." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips hopes that, by combining the A and B tracks and raising the 
expectations of the people now in the B track, the students will rise to those 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that we're not preparing kids very well in the B and C tracks 
and the expectations aren't high enough," Phillips said. "We're saying that 
high school diplomas should mean that kids can perform at a reasonable level. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't write well, if they don't have proficiency in reading, if they 
don't have proficiency in mathematics and higher-level thinking skills, they're 
not going to be competent in the work force, they're going to have difficulty 
changing jobs, and we're not doing them any favors." 
</P>
<P>
But some teachers are not convinced. They argue that simply putting a college 
prep label on a student does not make him or her college-bound. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're doing any better service to the minority students by 
putting them in a class that carries a label of college prep when in fact it's 
not," Jordan said. "I think we'd be lying to them." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the issue at Vista High is the increasing ethnic minority 
enrollment, now at 35% and climbing. With the minorities come lower levels of 
English proficiency, one of the main indicators of which track a student would 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Marv Abrams, chairman of the social sciences department at Vista High, said 78% 
of the school's Latino population is in the lower two tracks, and only 1% is in 
the honors track. Meanwhile, about 40% of all students are enrolled in the A 
track and 40% in the B track, with the remaining 20% equally divided among the 
honors track and the remedial C track. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is increase the number of minority students who are 
both in our college prep program and in our honors program," Phillips said. "I 
think it's very hard to pinpoint who is going to be academically successful, 
and who is not." 
</P>
<P>
Most agree that the skewed numbers of Latinos going into the B track, a 
non-college prep curriculum, is the result not just of a lack of language 
skills but also a lack of understanding of the school system by students and 
their parents, who decide which track the child will enter. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the current system believe better administration is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"The criticism that is often given of tracking is that students are not 
properly placed, that they tend to be stereotyped," said Keith Grauman, an 
honors teacher at Vista. "I think we all need to cooperatively share ownership 
for that as a problem, but it is not an irresolvable problem that then demands 
the restructuring and altering of a program that otherwise may be very 
functional and very effective." 
</P>
<P>
Grauman said counselors, teachers and administrators must share the burden of 
making students and parents aware of the options available and recognizing when 
a student is ready to be moved to a higher track. 
</P>
<P>
But some educators do not accept tracking's basic tenet that some students are 
more skilled than others and can be put on a spectrum of skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
"There are perhaps different learning styles," Abrams said. "But I don't think 
we can say that students are brighter than others because they can learn one 
way and not another way." 
</P>
<P>
"Good teachers will always get good work out of their students," Abrams said. 
"The whole key to this thing is classroom leadership. (The) A tracks have got 
them with the kids -- the students are the leaders. And, if you take all the 
leaders and put them in the same room, you're going to have a great time. But, 
if you have no leadership, and that's what happens in the B tracks, no one 
learns." 
</P>
<P>
The high school's Parents Teachers and Students Assn. has not taken a position 
on the issue, according to Linda Maguire, the organization's president-elect, 
and does not intend to unless the issue is left unresolved at tonight's school 
board meeting.

S.D. MAY GET AERIAL DOSE OF MALATHION; 
</P>
<P>
MEXFLY: DISCOVERY OF THE PESTS, WHICH CAN CAUSE HAVOC WITH CROPS, COULD RESULT 
IN SPRAYING OF CHEMICAL FROM THE AIR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three Mexican fruit flies have been trapped in El Cajon and state officials are 
considering the first aerial spraying of malathion in San Diego County, state 
and county officials confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Science Advisory Panel of the state Department of Food and Agriculture was 
briefed by telephone Wednesday about the recent Mexfly finds -- one mature male 
and two egg-bearing mature females that have been trapped since April 25 in a 
residential area just south of Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory panel, which helps guide statewide response to the fruit fly 
problem, is expected to make its recommendation to the state director of Food 
and Agriculture today, according to Gary Reece, chief of agricultural services 
for the San Diego County Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures. 
</P>
<P>
"Ground treatment or aerial treatment of malathion I'm sure is being 
discussed," Reece said. "There's strong reason to believe that an infestation 
has started. I know they're going to be interested in doing whatever they feel 
is needed to keep it from getting out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Jacob, administrative assistant to Supervisor George F. Bailey, said 
Bailey's office has been kept apprised of the state's deliberations about how 
to address the Mexfly problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for a report of what the action plan is going to be at this 
point," she said. "Whether or not they'll be spraying (malathion), we don't 
know yet. It is a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Mexican fruit flies are considered "the next major pest" after the 
Mediterranean fruit fly, or Medfly, according to Dr. Isi Siddiqui, assistant 
director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture. Slightly larger than 
house flies, the yellowish brown, banded pests are particularly dangerous to 
citrus, avocados, peaches, pears and other subtropical fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The last major local infestation of Mexflies, which spoil fruit by burrowing 
inside it to lay their eggs, occurred in 1954 in San Ysidro. Since then, 
isolated finds have been fairly frequent, and scientists speculate that the 
flies may hitch a ride across the Mexican border on fruit carried by tourists. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the state began a voluntary 
</P>
<P>
malathion ground-spraying program on El Cajon properties within 200 yards of 
where the Mexflies were found. On Tuesday and Wednesday, 19 property owners 
agreed to the spraying, according to Marty Muschinske, a state economic 
entomologist based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point it is voluntary, but once a statement of decision is made it 
will probably become mandatory," Muschinske said, adding that aerial 
application of malathion is possible. 
</P>
<P>
According to Siddiqui, what is significant about the recent trappings is not 
the number of Mexflies found, but that they were one-third of a mile apart. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican fruit fly in San Diego County, because of the proximity (to the 
border), are not unknown," he said. "Last year, there were nine single Mexfly 
finds there. But, finding three flies, especially two mated females, is cause 
for concern." 
</P>
<P>
Reece agreed. "If you trap multiple flies in a close proximity, then you know 
you have more flies there," he said, adding that the county routinely maintains 
2,700 traps -- five traps per square mile -- that are monitored year-round. 
When a fly is found, the county steps up its program to 80 traps per square 
mile, as was done in late April in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, on May 4, a fourth Mexfly was trapped more than 15 miles away, 
just north of Balboa Park. But scientists said the mature but unmated female 
was not cause for immediate concern because it appeared to be an isolated case. 
</P>
<P>
County and state officials agree that, even if malathion spraying is ordered, 
the use of sterile Mexflies will probably still play a major part in the 
pest-eradication strategy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in conjunction 
with its Mexican counterpart, has a continuing program to release a curtain of 
sterile fruit flies south of the border to help prevent the spread of the 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
Reece and Muschinske said they believe San Diego County may begin releasing 
sterile flies as well, and Jacobs said Bailey's office had been consulted about 
where breeding facilities can be placed in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever is done needs to be done quite quickly," Reece said, pointing out 
that because the program generally requires about a million flies per square 
mile, the breeding of flies needs to begin immediately. "If they decide to use 
the sterile release program. . . . that requires lead time." 
</P>
<P>
During the past several months, Los Angeles County has trapped "several" 
Mexflies, including three in one day in one trap, according to Bill Edwards, 
Los Angeles County's chief deputy commissioner of agriculture. But all of the 
Mexflies were trapped in areas already being treated for Mediterranean fruit 
flies "so we haven't had to do anything special," Edwards said.

BUILDER FACES NEW DELAY IN OXNARD DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer who has waited more than four years for the Oxnard City Council to 
decide whether to approve a 77-acre development on the northeast corner of 
Oxnard Boulevard and Gonzales Road will just have to wait a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
After three hours of debate, the City Council voted 3 to 2 late Tuesday to 
amend the General Plan and approve the Warmington Homes project, which would 
include 132 single-family houses, 154 condominiums and a 4 1/2-acre office 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council then referred the proposal to the Planning Commission for 
further review and for approval of a zone change and a special use permit. The 
move will delay a final decision by the council on the project until late 
summer, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi and council members Dorothy Maron and Manuel Lopez supported 
the project, while council members Ann Johs and Geraldine (Gerry) Furr opposed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Johs and Furr said they voted against the project because they believe that the 
office complex would create too much traffic for the neighborhood. Johs also 
said she opposed the project because she believes that Oxnard should first 
adopt its new General Plan, which it is scheduled to do next month. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council was prepared to make a final decision on the project. 
But after residents near the site objected to a 51,275-square-foot retail 
center, the developer asked the council to delay a decision to consider two 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy Strozier, a consultant for Warmington Homes of Agoura Hills, asked the 
council to consider substituting a 4 1/2-acre office building complex or 54 
additional condominium units. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council supported replacing the retail center with an office 
complex. However, because the project has been substantially altered, it 
requires further review by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Although representatives of the developer have been discussing the project with 
neighbors for 4 1/2 years, it continued Tuesday to be harshly criticized by 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not need another housing project in Oxnard at this time," said Scott 
Weiss, chairman of Citizens to Protect Oxnard, a grass-roots, slow-growth 
organization. "Despite what you have been told about supply and demand, this 
proposal will not make housing in Oxnard affordable." 
</P>
<P>
Elenor Branthoover, chairwoman of the Rio Lindo Neighborhood Council, which has 
criticized the project, asked the council to delay a decision until the city 
resolves allegations that planning officials gave it preferential treatment. 
The allegations, which were raised in a local newspaper, have tainted the 
project, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday did not address the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, City Manager David Mora dismissed the allegations, 
noting that the project has been "in the hopper for 4 1/2 years." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he sent a memo to Community Development Director Richard 
Maggio last year asking that the project not be delayed. Mora said he did so 
because the project had been delayed for years and he was worried that waiting 
for approval of the new General Plan would delay it further. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the project's retail center was criticized by members of the Rio 
Lindo Neighborhood Council. Members of the group said they feared that it would 
increase traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Strozier said that by replacing the retail center with offices, the number of 
traffic trips to and from the site would drop to about 6,000 a day from about 
8,000. The number of trips would drop to about 4,000 a day if the retail center 
is replaced with residential units, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the group's concerns, the developer has agreed to ban gas 
stations, fast-food restaurants, convenience stores, video arcades and liquor 
stores from the site.

'GO AHEAD, SHOOT ME' LED TO DEATH, WITNESS SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: AN ALLEGED MEMBER OF AN OXNARD-BASED GANG GOES ON TRIAL FOR THE KILLING 
OF MANUEL (DEADEYE) RODRIGUEZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Witnesses testified at the opening of a reputed Oxnard gang member's murder 
trial Wednesday that the youth killed a rival gang member who taunted, "Go 
ahead, shoot me." 
</P>
<P>
Arnel Salagubang, an alleged member of an Oxnard-based Filipino gang known as 
the Satanas, is charged with first-degree murder in the Nov. 22 shooting of 
Manuel (Deadeye) Rodriguez, who belonged to the Oxnard Latino gang Lemonwood 
Chiques. Both were 20 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang's trial was surrounded by heavy security and punctuated by halting, 
reluctant testimony from gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies frisked spectators with metal detectors before allowing them 
into the small courtroom, where the front rows between Salagubang and the 
audience were roped off. 
</P>
<P>
And the day's two major witnesses, admitted Satanas members David Rojas and 
Joffrey Lagadia, spent most of their time on the stand giving one-word answers 
in nearly inaudible voices while staring at the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas testified that Rodriguez cruised past him and eight friends in front of 
Channel Islands High School at 3 p.m. that day as school let out and shouted, 
"Chiques!" Rojas testified that Rodriguez then pulled his blue Honda alongside 
Salagubang's customized Datsun 280ZX and began arguing with Salagubang. 
Salagubang "got mad and was losing it," Rojas testified. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas testified that when Rodriguez reached under his car seat, Salagubang went 
back to the Datsun and got a single-shot .22-caliber derringer from Jesse 
Cortinas, a Satanas member. 
</P>
<P>
Salagubang then walked back to Rodriguez's car and pulled the trigger, but the 
gun did not go off, Rojas said. "He looked at it," then cocked the gun, while 
Rodriguez taunted, "shoot me," Rojas testified. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas said Salagubang shot Rodriguez, then got back in his car and drove off. 
Rojas said he was in a group of fellow Satanas in a Toyota pickup truck that 
followed the car from the scene and picked up Cortinas while Salagubang drove 
off alone. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was driven by Joffrey Lagadia, who testified Wednesday that someone 
later identified as Rodriguez had been yelling "gang things" such as "Chiques!" 
</P>
<P>
Shouting your gang name at a rival gang "is a challenge to fight," Lagadia told 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Lagadia also testified that someone got out of the car in front of his truck 
and began arguing with Rodriguez, who said, "Go ahead, shoot me." Salagubang 
then fired the gun and fled in his car, Lagadia testified. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors also heard testimony from Casiana Hollers, 16, the mother of Rodriguez's 
child, who testified that he left home that day at 12:30 p.m. promising to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison showed her a photograph of Rodriguez clad in 
blue sweat shirt and a black baseball cap bearing the word "Chiques" and asked 
her if she recognized it as her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Hollers replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that the colors of the Chiques?" Ellison asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said, starting to cry. "There is no colors." 
</P>
<P>
Ellison's opening statement characterized the shooting as "the twisted 
mentality of gangs and the senseless acts they're engaged in to show their 
machismo." 
</P>
<P>
Ellison told jurors that Jesse Cortinas has agreed to plead guilty to murder 
charges as a juvenile and testify against Salagubang to avoid being tried as an 
adult. Cortinas is expected to take the stand today.

$11.4 MILLION SPENT BY HOLIDAY BOWL FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fans attending the Holiday Bowl football game Dec. 29, 1989, at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium spent an estimated $11.4 million during the days before and 
after the game, according to figures released Monday by the game's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The economic impact, as measured by CIC Research, a consulting firm, rose from 
$10.6 million in 1988 and just $600,000 in 1978, when the first game was 
played. Sponsors described the game as the "largest bowl game outside of New 
Year's Day," based on the $1-million payment made to each of the two teams that 
played.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 ARRESTED OVER SALE OF DRUGS IN GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four people, including two San Fernando Valley residents, were arrested by 
undercover Glendale police officers who sold them six kilograms of cocaine for 
about $123,000, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction took place Monday in a Glendale motel room, according to a 
Glendale police report. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the men intended to smuggle the cocaine to Canada, where it 
would be worth two to three times the U.S. price. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of conspiracy and possession of cocaine were Michael 
Kardashian, 31, of North Hollywood; Simon Mouchmouchian, 33, of Reseda; Sami 
Churukian, 26, of Torrance; and Rexhep Gashi, 40, of Dania, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Churukian and Kardashian are Syrian citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Gashi is an Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
Mouchmouchian is from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for each suspect was set at $1 million.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CITY TO OBSERVE PEACE DAY MAY 20 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fillmore will celebrate May 20 as "Peace Day," along with at least 35 other 
California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Gov. George Deukmejian declared the third Sunday in May as Peace 
Day, in support of a resolution passed by the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The document was a collaboration between Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San 
Jose) and the Peace Day Project in Santa Cruz, where Peace Day has been 
celebrated since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Carman, a director of the Peace Day Project, said Peace Day was inspired 
by a production of the musical play "Peace Child" by David Woolcombe, which 
envisions a time in the future when Peace Day is celebrated internationally as 
"the day when peace broke out throughout the world." 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore joins 35 other California cities in proclaiming Peace Day, Carman 
said. The Peace Day Project has contacted 456 mayors throughout California 
inviting them to make Peace Day a state-wide event, Carman said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has no plans to celebrate the day with organized festivities. JANET

BISHOP MAHER HAS 2ND BRAIN TUMOR OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher underwent a second brain operation Wednesday 
to remove necrotic tumor tissue that was causing spinal fluid to accumulate in 
his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Maher,, 74,,, was in fair condition Wednesday afternoon after a two-hour 
operation that began about 9:30 a.m., said Dr. Thomas Waltz, chief of 
neurosurgery at Scripps Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very hopeful his neurologic function will be improved, but only time 
will tell," Waltz said after the surgery. "We know that the tumor has done some 
damage to the brain, but it has not done any damage to the part of the brain 
that has to do with speech and mental function. It's had to do with the 
function of his left extremities." 
</P>
<P>
Maher, bishop of the San Diego Roman Catholic Diocese, had returned to Scripps' 
Green Hospital on Tuesday for tests preparatory to radiation treatments for his 
brain tumor. Doctors removed about 80% of the tumor April 25. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop was not as alert Tuesday as he had been earlier, Waltz said. He also 
was complaining of increasing difficulty using his left arm and leg, and of 
back pain from a fall he suffered while recuperating at home from the original 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The radiation treatments were put off, and a second surgery was recommended 
after brain imaging showed the tumor remnant had swollen. It was causing 
pressure and was also probably blocking the release of spinal fluid, Waltz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The brain produces about a pint of spinal fluid a day in structures called 
ventricles, releasing into the rest of the nervous system. The tumor was 
trapping fluid in a section of a ventricle called the temporal horn, Waltz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During surgery, Dr. Brian Copeland and Waltz found that the residual tumor had 
begun decomposing after the previous surgery cut off its blood supply. This 
necrosis caused the tumor tissue to swell. 
</P>
<P>
Maher's chances of surviving the brain tumor, which is of a particularly 
virulent type, are no worse than before the second operation, Waltz said. 
Having removed more of the tumor might be seen as a positive sign, since that 
leaves fewer cancer cells to be destroyed by radiation therapy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Waltz said he is certain there has been some brain damage. Over the next 
few days, doctors will be watching Maher closely to determine its extent. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't know until he's awake, and we can examine him to test him," Waltz 
said, adding: "To recover to be a person who can be active and enjoy life and 
get things out of life and contribute to life, I think he has a reasonably 
decent chance of getting to that goal." 
</P>
<P>
Waltz said that, before surgery, the bishop was having increasing difficulty 
using his left arm and leg, because he couldn't tell where they were without 
looking at them. 
</P>
<P>
This neurological problem had improved slightly after the first surgery, but 
worsened again earlier this week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waltz said radiation therapy could begin about two weeks after Wednesday's 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Maher has led the diocese of more than 460,000 Roman Catholics since 1969. He 
is scheduled to retire on July 1, his 75th birthday.

BOARD REJECTS FUNDS FOR CAMARILLO CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors has rejected a proposal by Supervisor John K. 
Flynn to earmark $600,000 for construction of a community center and 
administration building at a proposed housing complex for mentally ill homeless 
people near Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn argued that the county's $600,000 would be the final piece of a 
complicated local, state and federal funding package that needs to be approved 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
Construction bids for the Lewis Road project must be requested by August or 
about $3.9 million in federal aid will be lost, county administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have people . . . who live in the river bottom, that has to be our 
highest priority," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisors Maggie Erickson and Madge L. Schaefer said the project should 
be considered along with many competing ones when the board holds its budget 
hearings in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful about making a decision without putting all the 
blocks out on the table," Erickson said. She and Schaefer voted to delay 
commitment to the project, while Flynn and Supervisor Susan K. Lacey favored 
it. Supervisor Jim Dougherty was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The $600,000 would pay for two-thirds of the cost of a community center that is 
needed to house a staff of mental health workers on-site with the patients, 
said Randy Feltman, director of county Mental Health Services. The other third 
would come from federal programs. DARYL KELLEY

STATE PANEL CLEARS P.V. SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes school board member Marlys Kinnel did not violate state 
conflict-of-interest laws when she voted in 1988 to ratify a policy giving an 
exemption from building fees to a number of developers, including the 
part-owner of the mall where she did promotion work, state officials have 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the state Fair Political Practices Commission comes in response 
to a complaint filed last October by Rolling Hills Estates resident Joanne 
Petow. Petow's complaint alleged Kinnel should have disqualified herself from 
voting on the policy because her employer's interests were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had done nothing wrong," Kinnel said in an interview Wednesday, 
adding that the complaint was a "very vicious tactic used to affect (last 
fall's) election." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed while Kinnel was running for reelection to the school 
board, seeking one of three open seats. Petow opposed her election, supporting 
three candidates who ran unsuccessfully as a slate. Kinnel handily won 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Petow's complaint stemmed from a $1.50-square-foot fee imposed on developers by 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District. The fee went into effect in 
June, 1987, but district officials, without school board approval, granted 
exemptions to developers who contended their projects had been delayed beyond 
the deadline because of events out of their control. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in June, 1988, Kinnel and other school board members unanimously approved 
a retroactive measure that officially instituted the district's policy of 
granting the exemptions. The action allowed developer Ron Florance to retain a 
$274,500 fee exemption that he had previously been given for an 80-home 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Pettow alleged in her complaint that Kinnel should not have voted on the policy 
because she worked at the Shops of Palos Verdes, a mall owned by by H &amp; F 
Associates, a partnership in which Florance is a general partner. As such, 
Florance should be considered a source of income for Kinnel, the complaint 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
However, the commission disagreed. "The mere fact that Mr. Florance is a 
general partner in H &amp; F Associates and has a 50% interest therein, does 
not support the conclusion that he should be considered a 'source' of income to 
Ms. Kinnel," a commission attorney wrote in an April 24 letter to Petow. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather, the partnership, H &amp; F Associates, would be considered the 
'source' of income to Ms. Kinnel. Based upon our investigation . . . there was 
no evidence that H &amp; F Associates would have been materially affected by 
Ms. Kinnel's participation in the governmental decision at issue." 
</P>
<P>
At the time the complaint was filed, Kinnel, who resigned from the mall job in 
December to devote more time to family matters, contended she did not work for 
Florance, but for a management company hired by H &amp; F to run the mall. 
Florance said he never spoke to Kinnel about the exemption for his housing 
project and had nothing to do with hiring her to work for the management 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Petow said she did not agree with the commission's decision. "I am 
disappointed, naturally," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said that, because Kinnel has stepped down from her job, "the 
conflict . . . has been removed." Moreover, she said she is glad that the 
developer fee exemption granted to Florance has subsequently been rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
David Capelouto, the district's assistant superintendent for business, said the 
exemption on the property was removed late last year after Florance sold the 
development to another company. The action was taken after the district's 
lawyers indicated that the exemption was not transferable to another party, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner is paying the fee under protest, Capelouto said.

TASK FORCE OUTLINES BENEFITS OF DIVIDING L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dividing the Los Angeles Unified School District into at least eight and as 
many as 49 smaller districts will improve academic performance and reduce the 
number of dropouts, according to a report issued Wednesday by a task force 
formed to study ways to break up the district. 
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the present 610,000-student district is "incapable of 
addressing the legitimate education needs of Los Angeles-area students," said 
Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), a longtime advocate of 
breaking up the district, who formed the task force. 
</P>
<P>
But two of the seven members appointed to serve on the Los Angeles Task Force 
for Better Education said that despite the report's conclusions, they have not 
seen enough evidence to show that dividing the district would cure the many 
ills plaguing the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can isolate the size of the district and say that is causing all the 
problems," said task force member Richard C. Williams, a professor of education 
at UCLA and director of the Corrine A. Seeds University Elementary School. 
"Gangs, poverty and immigration are issues that have to be taken into account." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that although the testimony presented during the four hearings 
held by the La Follette task force was compelling, it was largely the opinions 
of parents and teachers unhappy with the way they have been treated by district 
officials. No school district personnel testified during the hearings held over 
the past eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of what we heard was anecdotal evidence," Williams said. "This is not a 
study. This is an invitation to dance." 
</P>
<P>
Both Williams and task force member Leo Krzywkowski, associate dean of 
education at Cal State Northridge, said they heard enough testimony to support 
a detailed study of the effects of breaking up the Los Angeles school district. 
</P>
<P>
"It presents a strong argument for looking at the issue," Krzywkowski said. 
"But this is not a research paper." 
</P>
<P>
The state Board of Education today begins hearings in Sacramento to decide 
whether a $250,000 study by the Los Angeles County Commission on School 
District Organization is warranted. Gov. George Deukmejian has included money 
for the study in his proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
Dauna Packer, a parent and former school board candidate for the west San 
Fernando Valley, said a group known as United Parents of Los Angeles has sent 
the state board more than 4,000 letters during the past week supporting the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
If money for the county study is included in the final state budget and a study 
is completed, then voters living within the boundaries of the 708-square-mile 
school district would decide the issue, probably in three years, La Follette 
said. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette said questions of how to divide students, property and debt of the 
Los Angeles district would have to be answered by consultants hired by the 
county Commission on School District Organization. La Follette, who is leaving 
office after her term expires in December, said she did not know how much it 
would cost taxpayers to split up the district. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette said student performance would improve in smaller districts because 
locally elected board members would be more likely to listen to suggestions by 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school district officials have said attempts to break up the 
district probably would face a legal challenge on the grounds that such a plan 
would create more segregated school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school board President Jackie Goldberg criticized La Follette for 
the task force report and said more state money is needed for education. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crime that California ranks 30th among the states in spending on 
education," Goldberg said. "There is nothing to be gained by dividing up the 
district. It isn't going to change any of our problems." 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles President-elect Helen Bernstein said the district's 
current efforts at school-based management are a better way to give parents and 
teachers more say in running neighborhood schools than breaking up the 
district. UTLA has a membership of 26,000 teachers in the Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette, who has served five terms in the Assembly, has made several 
unsuccessful attempts in past years to interest colleagues in legislation to 
break up the Los Angeles school district. 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the task force were Bernard James of Pepperdine University 
School of Law; Ray Johnson, Inglewood chief of police; Edward W. Lee of the 
Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Los Angeles, and Ronald D. Stephens, 
director of the National School Safety Center in Encino. Jane Boeckmann, 
president of World Communications Inc., was also a member but did not attend 
any hearings, La Follette staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, while governor in 1970, vetoed a bill aimed at 
breaking up the Los Angeles school district, saying the measure would hamper 
efforts at the time to divide the district into administrative regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Hearings begin today in Sacramento to decide whether a $250,000 study of a 
school district breakup is warranted. If money is included in the state budget 
and a study is completed, then voters living within the boundaries of the 
708-square-mile school district would decide the issue, probably in three years 
after consultants submit recommendations on how to divide students, property 
and debt.

GLESS SAYS SHE LIED ABOUT HER RESIDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: THE ACTRESS TESTIFIES THAT SHE FEARED PUBLICITY AFTER A BREAK-IN AT HER 
HOUSE, ALLEGEDLY BY AN OBSESSIVE FAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Sharon Gless, co-star of the "Cagney and Lacey" TV series, testified 
Wednesday that she lied when she told reporters that she did not live at the 
Studio City house that an obsessed fan allegedly invaded with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
She was worried that disclosure of her address would lead to copycat incidents 
by other fans, Gless testified at a preliminary hearing in San Fernando 
Municipal Court for Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason was to protect me, since it's been blasted all over the press what 
my exact address was," Gless said. "I was very upset when I saw my actual 
address on the curb being photographed by the press." 
</P>
<P>
Gless, through her publicist Heidi Schaeffer, told reporters at the time of the 
incident that the house was used primarily as an office and that the actress 
resided elsewhere. In fact, Gless said Wednesday, she sleeps at the house about 
five nights a week and spends the other nights at her second house, which 
detectives said is in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of whether Gless lived at the house is important because Penn cannot 
be found guilty of residential burglary if the dwelling was used as an office, 
said Penn's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mitchell J. Bruckner. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was charged with two counts of residential burglary after police said she 
barricaded herself in the actress' house on March 30 with a .22-caliber rifle 
and 500 rounds of ammunition. Police persuaded Penn to surrender after a 
seven-hour standoff. 
</P>
<P>
Penn threatened to commit suicide and intended to commit an act of sexual 
battery on Gless, said detectives, who would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the counts stems from an alleged burglary three days earlier at the 
house, in which Penn allegedly stole Gless' address book to obtain the location 
of the actress' Malibu house. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, described by police as an obsessive fan of Gless', sent the actress at 
least 140 letters over a three-year period, authorities said. Gless obtained a 
restraining order in 1988 forbidding Penn to harass the actress or her family. 
</P>
<P>
Gless testified that she did not feel seriously threatened by Penn despite the 
fact that the stream of letters continued after the restraining order was 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't honestly feel anything like this would happen, never in a million 
years," Gless said. "I don't think that way. Other people were much more 
concerned than I."

The package absolutely, positively had to be there overnight, as the Federal 
Express advertising slogan puts it. But because it wasn't, administrators of 
the Santa Clarita Valley's only haven for battered women figure they lost 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
And they see no remedy in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The saga of the wayward package began April 11 when the Assn. to Aid Victims of 
Domestic Violence hurriedly submitted an application to the state one day 
before the deadline for a $250,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
The association is struggling to keep a financially troubled center for 
battered women afloat and viewed the state grant as the center's best hope of 
survival. But the package missed the deadline, arriving two days after it was 
raced to a Federal Express office in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the association learned that state officials rejected the grant 
application, despite pleas from the association, Assemblywoman Cathie Wright 
(R-Simi Valley) and Federal Express itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It is with deep regret that I must inform you that your proposal for the 
California Domestic Violence Assistance Program has been rejected," wrote G. 
Albert Howenstein, executive director of the Office of Criminal Justice 
Planning, in a May 3 letter. Howenstein said the state could not extend the 
deadline, that agency policy statements make clear that late proposals cannot 
be accepted, regardless of the cause. 
</P>
<P>
There was no guarantee the association would have received the grant, but Robin 
Shine Ackerman, a member of the association's board of directors, said the 
program was a good candidate because it met all 13 basic criteria for such 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the state, a Federal Express official acknowledged the company 
was responsible for the delay. "Please be assured this is not an example of the 
quality service we want to provide our customers, nor is it acceptable," the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The state office awards grants on a three-year cycle, so the association will 
be unable to apply for 1993 funding until 1992. "That is what is so devastating 
about the situation," said Ackerman. The rejection was the latest blow to the 
association, which provides counseling, a hot line and shelter for women and 
children seeking refuge from violent husbands and boyfriends. The botched 
delivery, Ackerman said, was an example of "Murphy's Law to the nth degree." 
</P>
<P>
In its eight years, the center has served women who were threatened, beaten and 
even stabbed. The program was shut down temporarily in February after some 
expected grants fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Association members also did not expect the demand for service to skyrocket 
last year, taxing the resources of the center, which requires $5,000 to $10,000 
to operate each month, Ackerman said. The number of calls to the center's hot 
line, for example, rose 217% to 900 calls last year, Ackerman said. Of those 
calls, 217 people required some continued service later. 
</P>
<P>
The center now operates on a reduced scale, supported by income from a thrift 
store the association operates. 
</P>
<P>
The grant application and three copies, weighing 9 pounds, were rushed to 
Federal Express April 11 shortly before 5 p.m., Ackerman said. Armand 
Schneider, a Federal Express spokesman, said he had not seen the state's 
rejection letter and could not comment on the matter Wednesday. Ackerman, 
meanwhile, said the association is applying for other grants. As for Federal 
Express, "we would hope they would want to make good on the grant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been apologetic and even sent Ackerman a dozen roses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ackerman, public affairs director for a developer, said she was miffed 
recently when her monthly statement from Federal Express arrived at her Encino 
office. Among the items listed was a 9-pound package supposedly sent to 
Sacramento April 11.

INDIAN LEADERS JOIN CAMPAIGN TO UNEARTH MORE OF 'LOST VILLAGE'; 
</P>
<P>
EXCAVATION: ENCINO SLOW-GROWTH GADFLY GATHERS SUPPORT IN BID TO DELAY 
CONSTRUCTION OF TWO OFFICE BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arguing that the full extent of a major archeological find on Ventura Boulevard 
has yet to be uncovered, an Encino slow-growth gadfly has rallied state Indian 
leaders and an archeologist to his campaign to get city officials to delay 
construction of two office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the argument by Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, 
is that more of the "Lost Village of Encino," discovered in 1984, must lie 
beneath two redevelopment sites on the north side of the boulevard between 
Balboa Boulevard and La Maida Street. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the presence of additional Indian remains is unconfirmed, but 
archeologist Nancy A. Whitney-Desautels of Huntington Beach, who excavated the 
"Lost Village," says she is certain it extended over a greater area than has 
been excavated. 
</P>
<P>
"For sure, there is an archeological site over there," she said. "It's part of 
the same village complex." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed redevelopment projects are on the same block as Los Encinos State 
Historic Park and across the street from an office building erected on the 
"Lost Village" site after it was excavated. 
</P>
<P>
Silver, well known for opposing virtually any new commercial development, said 
he is outraged that the two proposed office buildings have been cleared for 
construction permits without having to complete preliminary archeological 
surveys, and without soliciting Indians' comments. 
</P>
<P>
To Silver's chagrin, both proposed projects were reviewed by the city Building 
and Safety Department, which found there was no need for a full environmental 
impact report (EIR) or a preliminary archeological survey. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Holguin, chief of structural plan check for the building department, 
said that under state law, if construction workers encounter signs of the 
Indian village the developers will have to stop construction and a certified 
archeologist must be hired to conduct a study. 
</P>
<P>
The official who decided that no preliminary archeological surveys were needed 
was on jury duty this week and unavailable for comment, an assistant said. 
</P>
<P>
Silver alerted regional Indian leaders, Whitney-Desautels, and the state Native 
American Heritage Commission -- all of whom are now expressing concern and 
contacting city building officials. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Angulo, a Chumash who is chief of the California Indian Council, said 
he is not sure if anything lies under the controversial sites. But Angulo said 
the area was a trading place for several tribes during the 17th and 18th 
centuries, and that a preliminary archeological survey seemed logical. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying there's a burial ground, we're saying that it's very funny 
this is across the street from a great archeological find and all of a sudden, 
they don't need an EIR," said Angulo, who is joining Silver and 
Whitney-Desautels in appealing the city's findings to the Building and Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is this is an unfair burden the city is putting on the landowner," 
Whitney-Desautels said. "The city is putting the landowner in the position of 
potentially having tremendous slowdowns during the actual construction phase . 
. . Once he starts construction, whatever company he hires will get a daily 
rate for equipment even if the project is stalled" by the state requirement to 
complete an archeological study. 
</P>
<P>
The first "lost village" dig suspended construction work for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Developers of both projects blamed Silver for stirring up trouble and said they 
were perplexed he was raising the issue now, after they spent months meeting 
with his group and another homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Silver is going to use any means at his disposal to delay it. This is just 
the latest," said Gardena-based builder Jerry Katell, who plans a three-story, 
140,000-square-foot office building on the Pic-n-Save site. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Cohen, whose family's Studio City company plans a three-story, 
48,000-square-foot office building on the site of the former Mercedes-Benz 
dealership, said, "I believe he is doing this -- and using very poor judgment 
to use other people's culture and heritage -- as a means of getting his point 
through." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not exploiting these people. All I did was alert them," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Myers, executive secretary of the state Native American Heritage 
Commission, said his agency receives many calls from residents more concerned 
about development than Indian history. But he said the commission checks out 
every complaint anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of anyone's motives, if what they're saying is correct, we respond 
to them. My only concern is to protect some of the cultural resources," Myers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The first white men to come to the San Fernando Valley, the expedition of 
Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola in 1769, described in their journals a large 
Indian village near a spring in what is now Encino. Over the years, however, 
the location of the village was lost. In 1984, however, workers excavating on 
the southeast corner of Ventura Boulevard and Balboa Boulevard made a 
discovery. Their find of Indian remains and other items led archeologists to 
believe that the workers' discovery was part of the "Lost Village of Encino." 
The excavation took eight months, cost the developer $1.7 million and led to 
the discovery of more than a million artifacts and the remains of about a dozen 
Indians. To date, the presence of additional Indian remains is unconfirmed.

MAN ARRESTED OVER FIRE AT APARTMENT

<P>
A 25-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of setting fire to the Oxnard 
apartment he shared with his girlfriend, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Waterloo is being held in the Ventura Jail, in lieu of $100,000 bail, in 
the Sunday fire at the one-bedroom apartment on the 5000 block of Nautilus 
Street, said Capt. Pat Logue, an investigator for the Oxnard Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which caused an estimated $10,000 damage, probably was started with a 
match or cigarette lighter, Logue said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses identified Waterloo as a suspect, and he was arrested at 6:45 p.m. 
Monday, Logue said. 
</P>
<P>
Waterloo apparently had a dispute with his girlfriend, Logue said. She was 
visiting her mother in Camarillo when the fire began, Logue said. CAROL WATSON

COLLEGE BARS ANY MORE CONCERTS BY THE GRATEFUL DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to complaints about concert-goers' traffic, loitering and public 
urination, Cal State Dominguez Hills has decided never to invite the Grateful 
Dead rock band back to its campus. 
</P>
<P>
The band, which has a devoted following harking back to its roots in the 
counterculture of the 1960s, drew crowds of 30,000 to concerts on campus 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The concert on the campus was peaceful, . . . but it is important to us that 
we be a good neighbor to the Carson community," said university spokesman 
Richard Turner. 
</P>
<P>
"In the interest of good relations . . . we have decided not to invite the 
Grateful Dead back to our campus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The band was asked not to return to the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Orange 
County after three concerts there in April, 1989, resulted in 91 arrests, 
including some stemming from clashes with security forces. However, the band 
expects to return to the Forum in Inglewood this year despite the death of an 
LSD-intoxicated fan in police custody during a three-day stand there last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said university president Robert C. Detweiler decided late Sunday 
afternoon against inviting the band back after receiving a briefing from the 
captain of the Carson sheriff's station about community complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably best," Carson Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt said, "because our 
neighborhoods are up in arms about it." 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt said she had received calls about fans "parking all over the place, 
40-minute (delays) to get from the freeway to residents' homes, urinating in 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Turner said other large-scale events, including circus performances, reggae and 
gospel music festivals, and bicycle races had been staged on campus at the 
Velodrome without incident. 
</P>
<P>
But the Grateful Dead concert was the largest. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had a concert of this size on the campus," Turner said. "We have 
never had 30,000 people two days in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement officials praised the behavior of the crowd at the concert. 
About 20 undercover officers made more than 50 drug-related arrests, many for 
possession of hallucinogens like LSD, but none for more serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman allegedly took LSD outside the concert Saturday night, ran a red 
light in Manhattan Beach and broadsided another car, killing a pregnant woman 
and her fetus. Heather Tolles, 19, of South Pasadena was charged Tuesday with 
two counts of second-degree murder in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
University officials said their decision to ban future Grateful Dead concerts 
was not related to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to avoid the rowdiness that has plagued a number of Dead concerts 
across the nation, university officials and Bill Graham Productions Inc., the 
concert promoter, had taken special precautions, hiring 350 crowd control 
monitors and beefing up campus security with officers from other Cal State 
campuses and from the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said the promoter sent Grateful Dead fans detailed information, along 
with their tickets, on the whereabouts of private campgrounds, motels and 
hotels near the campus. Parking on campus was included in the ticket price. 
</P>
<P>
"We made sure people didn't camp out in Carson. We made every attempt," Turner 
said. "All the motels and hotels were full to capacity. We wanted to make sure 
there would be no disruption." 
</P>
<P>
The promoter put 150 portable toilets on the concert grounds and in parking 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, which provides police services for Carson under 
contract with the city, set up street barricades to keep concert traffic from 
overflowing into residential neighborhoods surrounding the campus. 
</P>
<P>
But the barricades became a bone of contention. 
</P>
<P>
"Neighbors felt like they were prisoners," said Councilwoman Sylvia Muise, who 
lives close to the university. 
</P>
<P>
"People couldn't go to back-yard barbecues because of roads blocked off. Food 
orders couldn't be delivered." 
</P>
<P>
Muise added that her neighbors told her of instances of drunkenness, nudity, 
urination, defecation and the display of Confederate flags in predominantly 
black neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
She said she received complaints from storekeepers who decided not to open for 
business after finding people sleeping in front of the stores. "Many of the 
people who roamed the streets are not people one would want to hold up as a 
role model for young people," Muise said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said the university, which has an operating budget of $50 million, 
netted less than $100,000 from the concert. 
</P>
<P>
The next major event on campus is a bicycle race involving the U.S. National 
Bicycling Team, which is scheduled for Friday night at the Velodrome.

FIREFIGHTERS GROUP BACKS DAVIS FOR SUPERVISOR; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: THE CANDIDATE FAVORS A COUNTYWIDE PARAMEDIC TRAINING PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn. announced its support 
Wednesday for Simi Valley City Councilman Bill Davis in his bid for the 4th 
District county supervisor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has also been endorsed by the Ventura County Public Employees Assn., 
is the second of five candidates in the supervisor's race to receive 
endorsements from county organizations and officials. 
</P>
<P>
Vicky Howard, also a Simi Valley council member, was recently backed by Sheriff 
John Gillespie, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and the Deputy Sheriffs Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Kraetsch, president of the 370-member firefighters association, said 
Wednesday that his group endorsed Davis because he favors a countywide 
paramedic training program for firefighters. Firefighters now are not required 
to have such training. 
</P>
<P>
Kraetsch said his group decided to back Davis after interviewing the five 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we endorsed Bill is that he had an attitude of how can we 
fix things rather than the reasons why we can't," Kraetsch said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of emergency service has been a major concern in the city of 
Moorpark, which is part of the 4th District, along with Simi Valley, Somis and 
the Santa Clara Valley. Officials and residents have increasingly complained 
about private ambulance crews taking up to half an hour to respond to emergency 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
Kraetsch said that while private ambulance operators provide quality service, 
firefighters cannot always depend on them to be at the scene of an accident 
when needed. 
</P>
<P>
Davis agreed with Kraetsch that county physicians could be used to train 
firefighters in emergency treatment. He said if elected he will make the issue 
his first priority. 
</P>
<P>
"My real concern is that the people in the 4th District have the best emergency 
medical service that can be provided," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other candidates in the race -- Glen Schmidt, a Moorpark planning 
commissioner, and Tom Ely, a Ventura Community College District trustee -- said 
Wednesday that they felt the Davis and Howard endorsements represent possible 
conflicts of interest. They said the only purpose of the endorsements is to 
influence the votes of elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in these kinds of things," said Ely, who said that he recently 
turned down endorsements from two community groups that he declined to 
identify. "I really believe it's a conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt agreed, saying Davis and Howard were essentially "buying votes" by 
promising to support various programs without knowing where the funding is 
going to come from. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Davis hasn't even looked at the county budget and he wants to commit 
millions of dollars" to a paramedic training program, said Schmidt, who served 
as 4th District supervisor from 1971 to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Harold Fick, a Simi Valley resident, disagreed with his fellow 
candidates. Fick said officials and organizations have the right to endorse 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any hard feelings about these kind of things," Fick said, adding 
that he did not feel the endorsements would affect the way people vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, people are more free thinking," Fick said. "In many cases, they don't 
like to have their leadership tell them how to vote."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEFENDANT ORDERED TO UNDERGO MENTAL TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two Soviet army deserters charged with killing a North Hollywood woman 
was ordered Wednesday to undergo a mental examination after a psychiatrist 
testified the defendant could not assist in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Howard J. Schwab ordered Peter Sakarias, 23, 
transferred to a state mental hospital for a three-month evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists must tell the court on Aug. 15 whether the man is mentally 
competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sakarias and Tauno Waidla, 22, were accused of killing Viivi Piirisild, 52, who 
was found beaten to death in her home July 12, 1988. They also allegedly tried 
to extort $3,000 from her and stole her jewelry after beating her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, both Estonians, deserted from the Soviet army in December, 1986, and 
entered the United States in 1987, eventually moving in with Piirisild and her 
husband, Avo Piirisild. 
</P>
<P>
The Piirisilds, also Estonians, were active in the Estonian community in Los 
Angeles and provided the men with a place to live while they adjusted to life 
in the United States, friends of the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men pleaded not guilty to charges of murder while lying in wait, robbery, 
burglary and selling stolen property. Their trial is scheduled to begin in 
September.

POT GROWERS WHO ADVERTISED ARE SENTENCED TO PRISON TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two La Mesa residents have been sentenced to federal prison for their roles in 
a marijuana production ring that was investigated after one defendant 
advertised her firm in "High Times" magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Albert James McCormick, 44, was ordered Tuesday to serve 18 months in prison, 
and Patricia Lynn Chu, 26, was sentenced to one year. 
</P>
<P>
Both pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana with the 
intent to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
A third defendant in the case, Joseph M. Elliott, 35, was convicted of the same 
charge and one count of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, 
according to Assistant U. S. Atty. Amalia L. Meza. She said Elliott could be 
given a maximum term of 40 years when he is sentenced May 14. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Administration officials began an investigation of the three 
after Chu's company, Early Pearl Garden Supply in San Diego, advertised the 
sale of hydroponic growing equipment in "High Times" magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine often publishes features on marijuana, and hydroponic equipment is 
used to grow plants without soil.

'GREYHOUND THERAPY' DETAILED AT OFFICERS' TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Testifying in the criminal trial of two fellow patrolmen, San Diego police 
officers and supervisors Wednesday described in detail a policy of clearing 
transients off downtown streets, with one lieutenant with more than 30 years on 
the force saying the Police Department commonly refers to the practice as 
"Greyhound therapy." 
</P>
<P>
A second supervisor, who works as a police agent and acting sergeant on the 
downtown beat, said the roundup policy was prohibited in the department's 
conduct manual, but added, "I don't know of any supervisors who haven't 
witnessed the practice" and allowed it to continue. 
</P>
<P>
A third officer, with 10 years of patrol duty, testified that the policy was 
condoned by the chief's office and high command because police administrators 
were tired of seeing homeless people on downtown streets while driving to 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were aware of it," Officer David Hoffman said of the chief, deputy chiefs 
and commanders on the seventh floor of police headquarters who want the 
homeless, transients and illegal aliens removed from the city's main commercial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
He said downtown merchants continually pressure police commanders to move the 
homeless out of their store doorways and off their sidewalks, and that business 
people and office workers are always complaining to police about the many 
homeless people lining the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The supervisors at particular meetings said this came from upstairs, which 
meant to me the seventh floor of the building," Hoffman said. "The chiefs and 
commanders probably saw it themselves when they came to work, and they were 
probably offended by it too." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony was heard in the weeklong San Diego Superior Court trial of Lloyd 
J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf, now on voluntary leave from their jobs as 
police officers on the downtown beat. They are charged with robbing and 
kidnaping three undocumented workers last August and, if convicted, could be 
sentenced to a maximum of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their defense, Hoff and Schaaf contend that they never kidnaped or 
robbed the three illegal aliens. Rather, they insist that they were following 
the common police practice of "Greyhound therapy" when they drove two of the 
undocumented workers out of the downtown and that they never had contact with 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
Hoff, in his first public comments about the case, took the stand briefly 
Wednesday afternoon and said that, in one of the alleged incidents, he and 
Schaaf drove two of the illegal aliens to an isolated spot on the railroad 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that several, if not a great amount of transients, including illegal 
aliens, sleep along those tracks," Hoff said. "And it was my belief they would 
not object to being taken there." 
</P>
<P>
Although that description fits the practice of rounding up transients as 
described by the other officers in the courtroom, police administrators at 
headquarters declined Wednesday to state whether such a policy exists. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Greg Clark, a police spokesman, said Tuesday that the chief's office hoped 
to issue a statement about the matter on Wednesday. But, on Wednesday, he said 
police officials have decided to wait until after the trial before publicly 
discussing the situation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Craig Rooten, the deputy district attorney who is prosecuting Hoff and 
Schaaf, read in open court from the police conduct manual, telling the jury 
that officers cannot detain or transport law-abiding citizens against their 
will. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens "must be permitted to go on their way" if officers stop them and 
cannot find probable cause that they committed a crime, Rooten said in reading 
from the manual. 
</P>
<P>
But Police Agent Perry Hooper, an 11-year veteran of the force, said officers 
and supervisors violate that portion of the manual every day in dealing with 
the transient problem downtown. And he said officers are never disciplined for 
the misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you telling us that policy was violated? Have you seen violations of this 
policy in the downtown area?" Rooten asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I have," Hooper answered. 
</P>
<P>
"And you are a police agent?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am." 
</P>
<P>
"And you have two stripes on your arm?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I do." 
</P>
<P>
Other officers said the pressure stems from recurring offenses downtown, 
particularly auto burglaries, drug deals and transients urinating and 
defecating on sidewalks and doorways. They said merchants, residents and office 
workers are tired of the criminal activity and nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, for instance, said police commonly move the transients out of the 
downtown shortly before dawn as a courtesy to people arriving for work. 
</P>
<P>
"We were asked to clear the people from the streets, so that people coming to 
work wouldn't see them," he said. "It was done all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the officers appeared reluctant to identify the police supervisors who 
condoned the practice. The officers either said they could not recall which 
supervisors approved the policy, or named only those colleagues who no longer 
work for the department. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Hooper said he was sure that "more than 20" supervisors approved 
the policy. But then he said he could not remember their names. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lt. Ron Seden, the executive officer in the Central Division -- which 
covers downtown -- said the roundup policy was being used and sanctioned even 
when he joined the department 31 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He said the practice is so pervasive that, often, city police move transients 
into other jurisdictions, such as National City or the unincorporated areas of 
the county, and that officers in those areas then move the transients back into 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we refer to as Greyhound therapy," he said. "That's the practice 
of moving individuals to other jurisdictions." 
</P>
<P>
The policy has caught the attention of the local ACLU. Legal director Betty 
Wheeler said in an interview this week that a lawsuit may be filed to stop the 
roundup policy because it appears to be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"It's flatly improper for the police to be rounding up and moving people, and, 
if that is going on, then it should come to an immediate stop," she said. "And 
the people who are responsible for the policy and practice should be informed 
immediately that that's not permissible, and all appropriate corrective steps 
should be taken." 
</P>
<P>
In other court testimony Wednesday, Officer George Maglaras testified that he 
detained one of the alleged victims earlier this year, but was ordered to 
release him when a police supervisor realized that the illegal alien was 
involved in the case against officers Hoff and Schaaf. 
</P>
<P>
Officer George N. Maglaras said there was no doubt when he stopped Rolando 
Carrera-Reyes that he was "speed-balling on heroin and cocaine." But, he said, 
Lt. Leroy Staley ordered him to release Carrera-Reyes because the illegal alien 
was an alleged victim of Hoff and Schaaf. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me it might appear the Police Department was harassing this 
individual, and I tended to agree with him," Maglaras said. 
</P>
<P>
"Would it be fair to say this person got a break most people don't?" asked 
defense attorney Everett Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the officer conceded. 
</P>
<P>
The trial continues today at 9 a.m.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASINO WILL BE RAZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former Horseshoe Club in Gardena, the city's oldest casino, will be razed 
in the coming months and replaced with a modern shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The Gardena City Council approved plans Tuesday night for the 
38,500-square-foot development at Rosecrans and Vermont avenues. The shopping 
center, approved by the Planning Commission last month, will feature two 
fast-food restaurants and a variety of other businesses. It will be developed 
by Emil Neshanian of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
When the 41-year-old club closed last May, Gardena was left with only the 
Eldorado Club and the Normandie Casino, compared to six clubs a decade ago.

REFLECTIONS: STRUGGLING BEFORE THE CONGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Perry C. Riddle 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marvin Coil became a messenger at Universal Pictures in 1930. He has been with 
Michael Landon Productions since 1958, first as a film editor, now as associate 
producer in charge of post production. Coil, 78, and his wife, Olive, live in 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 My father was a policeman in Detroit, three of my brothers were also 
policemen. When he retired we came out here and my mother said, "We need the 
money, you got to go to work." I should have finished high school, but I wasn't 
the worst one off out here. It made it a little bit more difficult for me to 
get moved up like other people did with the bigger educations, but it worked 
out all right. I've been in the studio business all my life. 
</P>
<P>
I bought this house in 1940 and moved in in January of '41, so I've been here 
50 years, next year. It was a very small, three-bedroom home and we paid $4,400 
for it, house and lot, in the heart of Studio City. It was brand new. 
</P>
<P>
My payments were $29 a month, and we were only making $26 a week so we had a 
little trouble making them. We were trying to raise a family at the same time 
and it became somewhat of a problem for a while, until we got it worked out. 
</P>
<P>
We worked out a budget with coffee cups. Every payday she would take so much 
and put in a coffee cup for the house payment, put in another coffee cup for 
the groceries, and another coffee cup for our gas bill and our electric bill. 
That was the only way we could do it. 
</P>
<P>
And you couldn't rob from one cup to another. So it was difficult, but when I 
look back on it we were really disciplined living on that money, because we 
didn't dare go in debt like they do today. 
</P>
<P>
In the Depression there was no money at all, so consequently we were brought up 
through the hard stuff and we did not get in debt. We didn't know if the 
Depression was going to come back in six, seven months or a year or two, so we 
just kept ourselves above water by putting our money in coffee cups, and it 
worked out all right. 
</P>
<P>
Now the real estate dealers come here and say, "We can get you $400,000 for 
this house." I say, "Yeah, but I got to find something else and we're 
comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
This area was beautiful, absolutely gorgeous. It was such a nice neighborhood 
that we did not lock a door in the house for the first 12 years. Today, we not 
only lock them, we've got deadbolts on them and we've got security systems. 
</P>
<P>
When we moved out here to the Valley there weren't over 35,000 people. Now what 
have you got, a million and a half? The Valley exploded after World War II, 
absolutely exploded. You could almost see the eruption, it was that bad. You 
could count the cars every day, it would go from two cars to six cars, to 12 
cars. It kept going up. 
</P>
<P>
I still love the Valley, I love the heat, I love the trees, I love everything 
green at this time of year. The only thing I don't like is the congestion that 
has been created. 
</P>
<P>
We've had our share of problems in this house. We lost one child to leukemia 
when he was 9 years old. We had a boy and a girl. My wife has had cancer four 
times. She's fine today, but that went on over a period of six or seven years. 
Six years is tough. 
</P>
<P>
We had no insurance, everything was out of your pocket. I walked away from the 
hospital bankrupt, I had practically nothing. I said, "We'll do it, don't 
worry." So we did it. There've been times when we didn't have the security we 
have today. 
</P>
<P>
We may not have the energy we used to have, or go dancing like we used to do, 
but we're happy. We've got everything, and we've got the house fixed up, this 
deck is just perfect in the summertime. We've got the best of life at this 
point, but it's been a struggle at times to get here. You can do it, it just 
takes determination and discipline in your younger life.

GEOLOGISTS WARN OF BIG QUAKE ON COAST; 
</P>
<P>
DANGER: THE MALIBU FAULT ZONE WAS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE INACTIVE. A TEMBLOR 
COULD TRIGGER SERIOUS LANDSLIDES, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
New data indicates that a complex fault system along the Malibu coast is both 
active and capable of causing a major earthquake of magnitude 6 or 7, two 
geologists who have closely studied the area warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The warning, backed up by findings from other geologists, may prompt the 
California Coastal Commission to ask the state to designate the Malibu coast a 
"special study zone" in which development would be tightly regulated because of 
the seismic danger. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the warning, one commissioner urged her colleagues to press for 
the designation, and commission Executive Director Peter Douglas said a letter 
already is being drafted to send to the state if the commission votes to move 
forward with the request. 
</P>
<P>
Former State Geologist James E. Slosson told the commission at a special 
workshop in Marina del Rey that recent geologic findings show such a 
designation is appropriate for Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
With one exception, the 10 geologists who also appeared before the commission 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Slosson, who has studied the area for 30 years, said a major quake along the 
Malibu coast fault zone -- previously thought to be inactive -- could cause 
extensive property damage and threaten lives by triggering "very serious" 
landslides and rock falls along Pacific Coast Highway and Malibu Canyon Road. 
The rocks along the coastline, he said, are "highly shattered and susceptible 
to failure in a major earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Slosson likened the danger to that posed by the 
Newport-Inglewood fault, which runs north to south across Los Angeles and 
Orange counties and caused the devastating Long Beach earthquake in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
The second geologist, Gary Greene of the U.S. Geological Survey, said that 
based on historical data the Malibu coast fault system is probably capable of a 
magnitude 6 earthquake and "it could be higher." 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake registering 5.7 and centered off Point Mugu caused more than 
$1-million damage in the Oxnard-Ventura area in February, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, geologists had not focused on the potential magnitude of a temblor 
from the Malibu fault because it was thought to be inactive. 
</P>
<P>
But the recent discoveries have lead Greene and others to the conclusion that 
"we are dealing with a fairly active seismic zone." 
</P>
<P>
Greene said recent evidence indicates there is more than one fault in the 
Malibu area. "My feeling is it is a system of . . . maybe a half-dozen faults." 
</P>
<P>
Geologists have known of the main Malibu fault for many years. But in the last 
few years, evidence has been found to indicate that it is active and more 
extensive than previously realized. Among the significant recent discoveries 
are two splays or splinter faults off the main Malibu fault that have been 
active within the last 11,000 years -- the benchmark for what constitutes an 
"active" fault in California. 
</P>
<P>
The first discovery of an active splinter fault in 1987, forced General Motors 
Corp. to abandon plans for construction of an $11-million advanced design 
center across Pacific Coast Highway from Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
And in recent months, digging at the site of a single-family home in Latigo 
Canyon also yielded evidence of an active fault. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the Alquist-Priolo Act, passed by the Legislature after the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake, the state geologist is required to designate special 
zones along known earthquake faults in California. The law prevents 
construction of buildings for human occupancy within 50 feet of an active 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, who lives in Malibu, urged her 
colleagues to press for such a designation. The matter is expected to be 
considered at the commission's meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Cobarrubias, geologist for the city of Los Angeles, said he has seen enough 
evidence to convince him that a special study zone is needed in Malibu. "The 
right thing to do would be to recommend to the state that the area be zoned as 
a special study zone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach private geologist Roy Shlemon said the new information "strongly 
suggests" that two splays of the Malibu coast fault zone are "probably active." 
</P>
<P>
But geologist Howard Spellman said he does not believe enough evidence has been 
collected to justify a special study zone. Instead, he suggested that the 
Coastal Commission deal with projects in Malibu on a case-by-case basis. "I 
don't think it should be zoned indiscriminately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In their testimony, the geologists told the commission that the Malibu fault 
zone runs parallel to the coastline, onshore in some areas and slightly 
offshore in others. Federal geologist Greene described it as a "thrust fault," 
in which one section of the earth's crust is moving vertically relative to the 
other. This contrasts with a "strike-slip fault," such as the San Andreas, in 
which the two sections move laterally. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said it is possible that the Malibu fault system ties in with the Santa 
Cruz Island fault, which runs beneath the ocean off the Santa Barbara County 
coast. If so, Greene suggested, the system could be "very significant as far as 
a serious hazard." 
</P>
<P>
He said the fault zone may be responsible for the numerous oil and gas seeps 
that occur in Santa Monica Bay. "They all line up on a trend to the fault," he 
said.

SHORTAGE OF FOSTER PARENTS THREATENS, GRAND JURY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An increase in children needing placement in foster homes and a decline in 
people available to care for them may lead to a shortage of foster parents in 
San Diego County, a grand jury report issued Wednesday said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said 5,200 children are served each month in the county's foster 
care system. The number of children needing long-term foster care is increasing 
by 8.5% a year, while the number of available homes is increasing by only 5%. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report: "The increase in abused children entering foster care 
in the (1980s) was due to many factors: increase in population, heightened 
awareness by the public, poverty and homelessness, breakdown of the family, 
teen-age pregnancies and, most of all, the escalating use of drugs and 
alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foster parents have been dropping out of the program. The 
reasons given for their leaving varies, from more women entering the work force 
to the difficulties they often encounter when dealing with the foster care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The report was issued by the county grand jury's Health and Social Services 
Committee after interviews with administrators and social workers for the Child 
Services Bureau Division of the Department of Social Services. Also interviewed 
were judges, doctors, nurses, psychologists and foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
Although foster parents think that the Child Services Bureau is doing the best 
it can with an "overwhelmed and under-budgeted system," many also feel they do 
not receive enough support from the system. 
</P>
<P>
"They receive more support from one another than from those trained and hired 
to assist them," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Some social workers often carry caseloads of 35 or more and are unable to spend 
enough time with the foster parents or the children. 
</P>
<P>
Among the problems cited in the report was a lack of uniform policy regarding 
foster children among the school districts. Some districts were cooperative, 
others found the children to be nuisances. One district in the county gave 
foster children three days to adjust to their new school environment. If they 
did not adjust, they were not allowed to stay in the school. Other schools will 
not enroll foster children in their special education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the grand jury's recommendations are that advice from foster parents be 
used when training programs are planned and that a plan be formulated to ensure 
that children receive proper medical care. The medical plan would be created in 
conjunction with the Child Services Bureau, the Children's Hospital Center for 
Child Protection, and other child health care and child protection agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the grand jury recommended that a list be prepared of doctors 
whose services to children are funded by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury also recommended that the County Department of Social Services 
consider foster parents "equal members of the social services team and 
encourage more networking between foster parents and social workers."

SENTENCE IS 2 YEARS IN METH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The girlfriend of the president of the San Diego chapter of Hells Angels has 
received a two-year federal prison term for assisting her boyfriend in a 
methamphetamine transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Pirelli, 22, of Lakeside, was also fined $10,000 by U.S. District 
Judge John Rhoades. 
</P>
<P>
Pirelli and the motorcycle gang president, Guy Russell Castiglione, 40, also of 
Lakeside, were arrested May 13, 1989, at the Temecula checkpoint after 2 pounds 
of methamphetamine were found in Pirelli's purse. 
</P>
<P>
Castiglione, who pleaded guilty Dec. 20 to possession of methamphetamine with 
intent to distribute, was sentenced by Rhoades on March 5 to five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Pirelli pleaded guilty the same day to using a telephone in a narcotics 
transaction, which exposed her to a maximum sentence of four years.

SON FINDS PARENTS SHOT DEAD

<P>
A Vista couple was found shot to death Wednesday in what authorities believe 
was a murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Gertrude and Charles Gross were discovered by their son, Thomas 
Gross, about 7 a.m., said Sheriff's Lt. John Tenwolde. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Gross, an Army staff sergeant, found his mother's body in the garage in 
the 100 block of Beaumont Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Gertrude Gross, 68, had been shot in the head, Tenwolde said. Charles Gross, 
71, a revolver in his hand, was found in the den slumped over a desk. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Gross apparently died of a bullet wound to the head from a .38-caliber 
revolver, said Robert Engel, a deputy coroner. An autopsy on Gertrude Gross is 
scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Tenwolde said family members told sheriff's deputies there had been "a long 
history of discord" between the two. But news of the deaths shocked neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Connie Verebel, who lives across the street from the Gross household, 
did not see the couple together very often, she did say, "They were both really 
neat, tidy people. They were always working on their yard. . . . She always 
waved at me and said hello whenever I saw her." 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor who shared the driveway with them described them as "a wonderful 
couple." 
</P>
<P>
George O'Hern said he had known the couple seven or eight years. O'Hern said he 
and Charles Gross often worked on home projects together. "We would repair the 
sprinklers together, the mail boxes. We had a lot of fun together." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hern said Charles Gross could not walk much, but Gertrude Gross took daily 
walks in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Gertrude had been scheduled to leave for her native Germany today, O'Hern said. 
The couple, he said, "seemed happy together."

POLY: THE SCHOOL'S FORTUNES CHANGE WITH THE SEASONS, BUT TWO-SPORT STANDOUT 
JONATHAN CAMPBELL REMAINS A CONSTANT.

<P>
Arms pumping, legs churning, teeth clenched, Poly High junior Jonathan Campbell 
rounds third base, his teammates roaring their approval as they leap from the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
The relay from the distant North Hollywood left fielder to the shortstop 
becomes merely a drill. But Campbell approaches home plate running harder 
still, looking like a football running back in a baseball uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell leaps, arms outstretched, reaching for home plate. He lands amid a 
cloud of dust, gloved hands sliding across the plate, helmet tumbling over his 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Home run, Jonathan Campbell-style. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hard nose," Poly baseball Coach Jerry Cord said. "But he's not at all a 
bully-type hard nose. More of an All-American-type hard nose." 
</P>
<P>
A fitting description of the blond-haired, blue-eyed Campbell, a muscular 
5-foot-10 1/2, 183-pound junior with an easy grin and a strong bat. 
</P>
<P>
He is a driven player with a full-throttle approach. In a conference game 
against Van Nuys this season, Campbell tagged up and scored on a medium-to-deep 
fly ball to right field. He was on second base at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cord: "You just don't see that." In the aforementioned win over North 
Hollywood, a game in which Campbell homered twice, he made his greatest impact 
in the field. With Poly leading by a run in the fourth inning and two runners 
on, Harry Marks launched a fly ball well over Campbell's head. Campbell turned 
and sprinted. With no fence in North Hollywood's left field, he continued to 
pursue what seemed an uncatchable ball. 
</P>
<P>
His chase scattered a group of North Hollywood football players practicing deep 
in the outfield and ended in an over-the-shoulder catch some 380 feet from home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
Marks, halfway around the infield by then, simply stopped and threw his helmet 
in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's words match his actions. This is a guy who, when asked whether he 
wanted to bat with the bases loaded in a pressure situation, responded 
quizzically: "Isn't that what we play for all our lives? To get up in that 
situation?" 
</P>
<P>
Such a competitive fire is engaging. And it is constant. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, Campbell trots out to left field and bats third for the team 
ranked No. 4 in the region by The Times, a team unbeaten in conference play, a 
team with a 22-3 overall record and a legitimate chance to win a City Section 
4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
In autumn, Campbell toils with a football tucked under his arm; he is a 
two-time All-Pac-8 Conference running back who spent his junior season plowing 
for 1,159 yards and 12 touchdowns. But he endured defeat after defeat for a 
downtrodden Poly team that finished 1-8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Behold the athletic life of Jonathan Campbell, in which winning and losing seem 
to be dictated by the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall after football games, Campbell admits, he and his teammates will 
head to a local fast-food joint, eat a few burgers and, sadly, just go home. 
</P>
<P>
But in the spring? 
</P>
<P>
"It's great, it's great, it's great," Campbell said with a grin. "After the 
game, I don't have to feel depressed or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Depression has no place on the diamond during this bull-market year. Poly is 
stacked with depth -- so much so that Campbell, for all his talents, does not 
dominate the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Eddie Castellanos boasts an 11-0 record, best in the region. Rodrigo 
Dorame, a right fielder and pitcher, is batting .380 and has driven in a 
team-high 26 runs. Second baseman Roy Lozano, an excellent defender, is batting 
.338 with a team-high seven doubles. Senior shortstop and cleanup hitter Gabe 
Chavez has knocked in 21 runs and is batting .319. Third baseman Marlon 
McKinney is batting .354 with 17 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a total difference in confidence," Campbell said of the disparity 
between programs. "We don't feel like a team could really beat us if we're at 
our best. Whereas in football, we just don't have that confidence. We don't 
just play on the football team. We worry too much about what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Campbell is playing well in his first varsity baseball season. He 
is batting .350, with 21 RBIs, second most on the team. Campbell leads the team 
in runs scored with 27 and is second in stolen bases with 13. But his 
contributions, if you listen to his coaches, rise above mere numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take a dozen of him," Cord said. "If you have a dozen Jonathan Campbells 
on your team. . . . Well, you wouldn't win 'em all, but you wouldn't lose 
many." 
</P>
<P>
In one early-season game that Poly was winning easily, Cord pulled his 
starters. While most savored the respite, Campbell grabbed a helmet then raced 
toward first base -- where he coached for the remainder of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't settle for anything less than maximum performance," football Coach 
Fred Cuccia said. "And he doesn't know how good he can be. . . . After he ran 
for 280-something (287) yards against Verdugo Hills, he kept telling the team, 
'I'm nothing special. I'm just part of the team.' " 
</P>
<P>
Team talk aside, Campbell relishes individual play. Which might explain his 
preference in sports. 
</P>
<P>
"In football, I guess, you can hide if you're not good," he said. "You can hide 
and not do your job. But in baseball, you're right there in the open. 
Everybody's looking at you and the pitcher just goes at you, and what you do 
with it, you know, depends on you." 
</P>
<P>
But Cuccia, a veteran coach who is in his second year at Poly, might have 
started to resuscitate the football program. The spring football class at Poly 
has an enrollment of 90 -- 70 more than last year. Cuccia credits part of the 
upswing to the on-campus recruiting done by Campbell and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give them a program where they're having fun and experiencing 
success at the same time," Cuccia said. "Poly hasn't been able to do that in 
the past, but we want to have our kids enjoy what they're doing and get almost 
the same thing that Jerry has going in the baseball program." 
</P>
<P>
Because McKinney, Dorame and Campbell are football players, Cuccia takes more 
than a passing interest in the baseball program. Cuccia was in the dugout when 
Poly's 12-game win streak ended in a 7-6 loss to Birmingham in the Holt-Goodman 
tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell had been doubled off third base in the final inning to kill a Poly 
threat. After tearing off his jersey, Campbell sat in the dugout, alone, elbows 
on knees, and stared off in the distance. No one dared approach him. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him after that game and he was just devastated," Cuccia said. "He's just 
a tremendous competitor. That's what sets him apart from all the other kids at 
Poly." 
</P>
<P>
Witnessing that intensity also piqued Cuccia's interest on a personal level. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to having him (next fall)," Cuccia said. "And you 
tell the other schools out there that they can't have him. He's ours."

STATE JUNIOR COLLEGE SOFTBALL TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
MOORPARK'S THOMAS FILLS IN THE BLANKS AGAINST MT. SAC, 2-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Singer's solo home run was all the Moorpark College softball team needed, 
which was fortunate for the Lady Raiders because offensively that was about all 
they had. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark managed only two hits, but pitcher Robin Thomas shut down visiting Mt. 
San Antonio College on Wednesday in Moorpark's 2-0 win in the first round of 
the Southern California regional of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In another first-round game, 15th-seeded Antelope Valley (15-20) was eliminated 
by second-seeded Cypress, 1-0. Host Cypress scored the game's only run in the 
third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Moorpark (27-9) advanced to a best-of-three second-round matchup 
against Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark will follow Thomas' guide throughout the playoffs. Thomas (25-6), a 
freshman right-hander, has earned the decision in all but five of Moorpark's 
games, and Coach Will Thurston plans to rely on her even more, if possible, 
during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Thurston, who calls pitching depth the team's "weak link," said, "For us to be 
able to get in the final, we're going to have to get three strong games from 
(Thomas)." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas cruised until the fifth when 14th-seeded Mt. SAC (18-17) opened with two 
consecutive singles and had runners at second and third with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark led, 1-0, at that point, and Thomas retired the next two batters on a 
strikeout and groundout to end the threat. She stranded three more runners in 
the final two innings and called her dropball her most effective pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really confident today," said Thomas, who drove in Jamie Heggen with 
Moorpark's second run on a single to left in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas allowed six singles and two walks, both intentional. The walks were 
issued to Carrie Evans, who hit a grand slam when Mt. SAC overcame a four-run 
deficit to defeat Moorpark earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I'm going to allow our team to get beat by that girl a second 
time," Thurston said. 
</P>
<P>
Singer's two-out home run in the second put Moorpark ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's softball field doesn't have a fence, and Singer simply kept running 
after hooking a line drive down the left-field line. She had reached third base 
by the time the left-fielder reached the ball. 
</P>

BALLARD PAIR SWIM WELL IN PRELIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As family traditions go, the Ballards of Encino have their act down pretty 
well. Some families take pride in, say, sending all their children to the 
parents' alma maters, or having all their offspring take piano lessons. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ballards just plain swim fast. In the late '80s, Matt and Jason Ballard 
dominated City Section championship meets in the distance freestyles and 
butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday in the City prelims at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach, the latest in 
this lineage of Birmingham High aquatic standouts swam with a fury indicating 
that the tradition is alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Christian Ballard blazed through his heat of the 200-yard freestyle in 1 
minute 44.67 seconds. That time improved his season best by four seconds and 
came within two seconds of his best time of 1:42.40, set in the senior 
nationals last summer. His closest competitor, Tate Hurvitz of Grant, swam a 
1:49.92. 
</P>
<P>
In the 500 free, Ballard also flew, swimming 4:39.33, more than 16 seconds 
ahead of second-place finisher Hurvitz (4:55.97). Not bad for a guy who came in 
not quite prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't taper or rest for this meet," Ballard said. Next week in the City 
finals, Birmingham Coach Nick Rodionoff indicated, Ballard could ride a wave of 
inspiration to even better times. 
</P>
<P>
"If he really wants, he can break the City records," Rodionoff said. "It'll be 
a psych swim next week." 
</P>
<P>
Just as effective was Christian's sister, Heather, a sophomore distance 
freestyler who cruised through her heats with true Ballard ease. Heather, who 
also has qualified for the mile, shotput and high jump in the City track meet 
finals, won her heat in the 200 free (1:57.54, three seconds shy of the City 
record) and took second in the 500 free (5:08.52, two seconds better than her 
season best). 
</P>
<P>
The top 12 finishers in each event qualified for the finals, which also will be 
held at Belmont Plaza. The top six finishers will swim in the championship 
finals and the bottom six will swim in the consolation finals.

HAWTHORNE IS HEALTHY FOR TITLE DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RAATZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It doesn't sound as if Hawthorne High senior sprinter Chris Alexander is 
getting his hopes up too high before Saturday's Southern Section 4-A Division 
preliminaries at Gahr High in Cerritos, the first step in the Cougars' defense 
of their state boys' track and field title. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Alexander anchored Hawthorne's 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams, 
which went undefeated with the exception of a disqualification in the 400 at 
the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
"But right now, I don't think we'll do as well as we did last year in the 
relays," said Alexander, who missed the season with a hamstring pull suffered 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
However, Alexander pointed out that not doing as well -- by the Cougars' 
standards -- can mean winning by a smaller margin. "As compared to other teams, 
I think we'll still be on top," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander's cautious outlook stems from Hawthorne's injury problems. The 
Cougars' relay teams haven't been intact all season, and they still won't be 
intact in the Southern Section and state meets. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Thomas Cole is out for the rest of the season, leaving Coach Kye 
Courtney undecided about who will run Hawthorne's third leg. Injuries have 
forced untested sophomore Demond Smith to take over the first leg. 
</P>
<P>
But the return of Alexander and junior Erik Allen, who is Hawthorne's 
second-leg runner but missed much of this season's dual-meet schedule with 
hamstring problems of his own, means that the Cougars have their two most 
important performers. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who will be a running back for UCLA's football team in the fall, was 
fifth in the 100 meters at the state meet last season, while Allen was fourth 
in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney clearly is grateful that his standouts are back in time for the most 
meaningful events of the season. And, he said, the competition in the Bay 
League finals was crucial for Alexander and Allen to "get back in the swing of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
"If we were going into this meet without (Alexander and Allen running in) our 
previous meet, then we'd be hurting. With the other meet behind us, they'll be 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
Courtney, who has guided Hawthorne to six state titles in seven years and three 
in a row, said he has been extra careful with Alexander and Allen, not wanting 
to rush them back or bring one back before the other. But with the season 
amounting to just a warm-up for his powerful team, Courtney has had no reason 
to rush them back. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Courtney said, his two top speedsters are fresh, focused and almost 100% 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been there before and know what to expect," he said. "They're ready to 
explode." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Courtney said, at this point his team doesn't look as dominant as 
in other seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the depth," he said. "(Pasadena) Muir has a lot of depth, and I 
just don't know how anybody is going to catch them." 
</P>
<P>
But Courtney isn't counting his team out of the running for another state 
title, though some of his younger athletes are facing big-time pressure for the 
first time, including Smith, who is also a hurdler. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to have some help from the hurdler," Courtney said when asked to 
offer an early assessment of his team's chances at the state meet at Cerritos 
College on June 1-2. "That's asking an awful lot of a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"But if (Smith) does what he can do, maybe we can pull it off. We don't have to 
win events; we can just get our seconds, thirds and fourths." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander took a couple of individual firsts at the Bay League meet. He ran the 
100 meters in 10.86 seconds (wind-aided), off a bit from his best time of 10.6. 
But his time of 22.2 in the 200 equaled his career best. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's bests are 10.7 in the 100 and 22.0 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said he considers himself to be "about 85% to 90%" healthy. "My only 
troubles could be in endurance, like in the (1,600-meter relay)," he added. 
"Speed-wise, I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander shares his coach's belief that getting last week's meet under his 
belt was of vital importance. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to break the ice," he said. "But I expect to do a lot better this 
weekend and to continue to get better as I get back into it." 
</P>
<P>
Being a two-sport star, Alexander has the opportunity to approach track almost 
as a hobby. "I look at track as conditioning for football in the off-season," 
he said. "And it's definitely helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Although he will also run track for the Bruins, Alexander's commitment will be 
to UCLA football Coach Terry Donahue, who has always made it clear that there 
is only one sport for his players. 
</P>
<P>
"Football comes first," Alexander said of his college athletic plans. "I will 
play spring football, but whenever I have free time I'll do track." 
</P>
<P>
He's just hoping he won't have injury-induced "free time," as he's had for four 
months this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Morningside girls should highlight the 400- and 1,600-meter relays at the 
Southern Section 2-A Division preliminaries at Gahr High on Friday afternoon. 
The Monarchs have the best time in the state this season in the 1,600 (3:48.6) 
and the fourth-best time in the 400 (47.72). 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Hawthorne girls' relay teams will be among the featured 
attractions at the 4-A preliminaries at Gahr on Saturday afternoon. The Cougars 
are just off Morningside's pace with times of 47.78 in the 400 and 3:49.68 in 
the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's Curtis Hawkins and Banning's Terrence Campbell, two of the state's top 
hurdlers, have been training together in preparation for the L.A. City Section 
quarterfinals at Birmingham High in Van Nuys this afternoon. The 110-meter high 
hurdles is the best event for both athletes, who have recorded times of 14.0 
and 14.1 seconds, respectively, this season. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the state has a better time than the two seniors. Campbell, who beat 
Hawkins by a tenth of a second in the 110-meter high hurdles and the 300-meter 
intermediate hurdles on Thursday at the Southern Pacific Conference 
championships, said their long-time competition has benefited both runners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good rivalry because we're always pushing each other, trying to help 
each other out," said Campbell, who helped the Pilots win the conference title. 
"I'm always running as fast as I can, but Hawkins is always right there next to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Another Banning-Carson track rivalry takes place in the distance races, where 
Pilot junior Ramon Rendon and the Colts' Steven Gonzales and Richard Raya have 
been competing with each other all season. The competition will continue in the 
City quarterfinals. So far, Gonzales, also a junior, has fared the best. In the 
1,600 meters at the conference championships, he won in 4:30.0, with Raya and 
Rendon next at 4:31.7 and 4:37.0, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Raya, a senior, has a season-best time in the 1,600 meters of 4:25.97, No. 4 in 
the City Section. Gonzales ranks right behind at 4:28.7 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales also won the 3,200 meters, with Rendon a step behind him for almost 
all of the race. Gonzales was able to pull away down the stretch and finished 
in 9:57.7. 
</P>
<P>
After that race, Gonzales said it was typical of his battles with Rendon. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the whole season, both of us have been competing for position, so I 
knew that he was going to be there," said Gonzales, who is third in the City 
Section with a season best of 9:26.7 in the 3,200 meters. "But I've always 
out-kicked him, so I knew that I'd beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said that although some runners are conserving energy and training 
lightly with big postseason meets coming up, he's practicing harder than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel strong," he said. "I'm just trying to build up and get my speed up so I 
can compete against the higher-ranked runners." 
</P>
<P>
Banning's multipurpose track performer Lashette Molette is also on the way to 
the City quarterfinals after battling dehydration, the flu and strep throat 
since mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
Despite feeling weak and having limited practice time prior to the conference 
championships, Molette had a busy and successful meet on Thursday as she won 
the 110-meter low hurdles, anchored the Pilots' second-place 4x100-meter relay 
team, took fourth in the 200 meters and took fourth in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
Molette admitted she that was a bit dazed in the meet at Carson High, "rushing 
back and forth, doing everything." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't eat all day; I hit my head on the (high-jump) bar and had a swollen 
lip," she said with a weary laugh. "But I have to keep my body in shape for 
this next week so I won't get sick again and so I can run my best." 
</P>
<P>
Molette said there is a simple answer to her physical problems: "I haven't been 
drinking enough water. I've been mostly drinking Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
"Paramedics told me that Gatorade doesn't do you any good and even makes you 
more dehydrated." 
</P>
<P>
Well, there's one product you'll never see Lashette Molette endorsing.

At times, the meeting was as confusing as trying to decipher an opposing team's 
signs, but the City Section 4-A Division baseball seedings were made by a panel 
of coaches Wednesday night, with Poly High edging out El Camino Real for the 
No. 1 berth.

SAMONIEGO HOMERS TO LEAD SAN FERNANDO

<P>
San Fernando High snuffed three consecutive rallies by visiting Taft on 
Wednesday and senior first baseman Bernie Samoniego hit a two-run home run to 
lead the Tigers to a 3-2 victory in a first-round 4-A Division game. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (14-6) led, 2-0, after Samoniego smashed a 3-2 pitch from freshman 
Julie Kawamoto over the left-field fence with Gloria Sanchez aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Taft (9-12) scored a run in the fourth and San Fernando countered with a run in 
the bottom of the inning. Taft rallies in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings, 
however, were cut short by senior right-handed pitcher Denise Mendoza, a good 
San Fernando defense and a controversial force play at third base. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Taft left runners at second and third as Mendoza recorded the 
final two outs on a strikeout and a back-to-the-box groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Taft scored a run in the fifth, but San Fernando left fielder Lorena Lopez 
prevented further damage with a running backhanded catch of a line drive by 
Stephanie Fontane to leave a runner stranded at second base. 
</P>
<P>
With none out in the sixth and Taft runners at first and second, Mendoza 
fielded a sacrifice bunt and relayed to shortstop Edna Salandez covering third 
base in time to retire Michele Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
The ball appeared to squirt out of Salandez's mitt. But both umpires -- to the 
vocal displeasure of a bleacher full of angry Taft supporters behind third base 
-- ruled the play an out. Taft did not score in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"That play had an effect on the game," Taft Coach Carol Morgan said. "I don't 
believe that both umpires could see it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Salandez: "It didn't pop out. I don't know what they're all thinking." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Coach Bill Rielly said that Salandez made a "snow-cone" catch. 
"All she needed to do was step on the base and she was sitting on it." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando will play Carson, which had a first-round bye, Wednesday at 
Carson. VINCE KOWALICK

CLU, MASTER'S TO OPEN QUESTS FOR DISTRICT 3 BASEBALL TITLE 
</P>

<P>
Fans of great pitching might not want to attend the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 baseball playoffs, which start today at 
Azusa Pacific University. 
</P>
<P>
But those who appreciate good hitting could be in for a treat. 
</P>
<P>
Three schools -- Cal Baptist, Azusa Pacific and The Master's College) -- in the 
four-team double-elimination tournament are hitting better than .300, and the 
fourth (Cal Lutheran), is batting .289. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran (28-13), seeded third, will play second-seeded Cal Baptist (34-16) 
in a first-round game at 11 a.m. at Cougar Field, and No. 4 Master's (26-20) 
will play No. 1 Azusa Pacific (32-10) at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a wide-open tournament," Master's assistant Chris Harrison 
said. "Azusa Pacific has to be favored because they've been the most consistent 
team during the season and they're playing on their home field, but any of the 
other three teams are capable of winning." 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific, the 1988 district champion, started the season 5-7 but has won 
27 of its past 30 games, including 12 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars are batting .327, led by first baseman Carlos Salazar, who won the 
Golden State Athletic Conference's triple crown by batting .396, hitting 20 
home runs and driving in 62 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Ric Slagle, a second baseman, is batting .427 for Cal Baptist, which carries a 
.347 team average. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Washington (.388, 10 home runs, 34 RBIs) and Dave Leonhardt (.344, six 
home runs, 40 RBIs) lead Cal Lutheran's attack. Mike Clark (6-1, 2.80 
earned-run average) will start on the mound in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
Mark MacArthur (.351, eight home runs, 44 RBIs) is the top offensive threat for 
Master's, which is expected to start pitcher John March (1-6, 7.45 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran split two games against Cal Baptist during the regular season. 
Master's was 0-2 against Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Having swept Cal Baptist to win its third consecutive NAIA District 3 title 
last Friday, Cal Lutheran will play Adams State College (Alamosa, Colo.) in the 
Bi-District 2 championships, starting today at Crawford Field. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the best-of-three series will advance to the 16-team NAIA 
championships at the University of West Florida in Pensacola, May 17-19. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran (31-10-2), gunning for its third consecutive appearance in the 
NAIA championships, will play Adams State (28-16) at 1 and 3 this afternoon, 
and, if necessary, at 10 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Senior DeeAndra Pilkington (16-6) and junior Leslie Stevens (13-4) are expected 
to start for Cal Lutheran, while sophomore Teresa Maldonado (10-8) and senior 
Veronica Flores (10-5) are the scheduled starters for Adams State. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran, which has won 19 of its past 20 games, won the District 3 title 
as expected, but Adams State was the surprise victor in the four-team District 
7 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Seeded third, Adams State lost its first-round game to Mesa State (Grand 
Junction, Colo.), then reeled off four consecutive wins, the last two coming in 
rematches against Mesa State (7-5 in 11 innings, and 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
Stevens (.331, 25 RBIs) and Kim White (.404, seven doubles, eight triples) lead 
a Cal Lutheran offense that is batting .291 and scoring 4.3 runs a game.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: USD TENNIS TEAM WINS IN NCAA; SDSU BEATEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No. 14 USD advanced to the second round of NCAA women's tennis championships 
for the second consecutive year with a 5-4 victory over No. 19 Kentucky 
Wednesday in Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State was not quite as fortunate, losing to No. 18 Indiana, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the Toreras' victory was a come-from-behind victory by the No. 2 
doubles team of Laura Mannisto and Christy Drage. With the match tied at three, 
Kentucky's team of Antoinette Grech and Melissa Nelson lost the opening set, 
6-4, but led the second-set tiebreaker, 5-1, before Mannisto and Drage rallied 
to win it, 9-7, for the match. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Hansen and Tonya Fuller then clinched the team match with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 
victory at No. 3 doubles. Aby Brayton, Tonya Fuller and Sakolwan Kacharoen were 
winners in No. 1, 2 and 3 singles. The Toreras (12-11) play No. 3 Cal today at 
9 a.m. Cal defeated USD, 7-2, earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU finished 17-12. Indiana (23-6) has won 18 consecutive matches. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1-ranked Steffi Graf will defend her title in the 1990 Great American Bank 
Tennis tournament Aug. 6-12 at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club.

<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's Eric Christopherson went three for four with an RBI, and Mike 
MacKinnon broke a 3-0 game open with a three-run double in the seventh as the 
Aztecs coasted to a 10-2 victory over host UC San Diego. Five SDSU pitchers 
combined on a four-hitter, with Andy Peterson (5-2) picking up the victory. 
SDSU is 39-20. UCSD finished the regular at 19-17-2. 
</P>
<P>
SIGNINGS 
</P>
<P>
The USD baseball team has signed Michael Austin, a pitcher at Monte Vista High 
in Danville, to a letter of intent. Austin, a 6-foot-1 right-hander, is 7-1 
this season with a 2.50 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Clark James, a two-time Times All-County basketball selection, has signed a 
letter of intent to play for the Air Force Academy. James, a 6-5 forward who 
averaged 28 points his senior season, is the second area player to sign with 
Air Force. El Camino's Travis Gilley committed last month. James chose Air 
Force over USD and Santa Barbara.

HADDEN GETS A GRIP FOR RBV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Hadden has been nearly perfect for the past two weeks. As a pitcher, he 
has won two of Rancho Buena Vista's past three games. As a batter, he has hit 
.833 (10 for 12). 
</P>
<P>
If there's a player to rub for good luck these days, it's Hadden. 
</P>
<P>
So when he finally got in trouble in the bottom of the seventh Wednesday at 
Orange Glen -- the bases were loaded with one out -- Coach Steve Hargrave 
thought about bringing in reliever Stan McCarver to protect the 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then he thought better of it. 
</P>
<P>
Hadden gave his coach a long look before facing Brian Kooiman, who had driven 
in Orange Glen's first run with a line-drive sacrifice fly to left field in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was seeing if (Hargrave) was going to take me out," Hadden said, "but he 
knew I could bulldog it." 
</P>
<P>
Kooiman hit a line drive headed for center field, but Hadden speared it, then 
doubled up the runner off first to give RBV a 4-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hit it anywhere but waist-high on his glove side, we score," Orange Glen 
Coach Ken Walker said. "That ball was scalded." 
</P>
<P>
RBV (13-10-1, 8-3) remained tied with Poway for second in the Palomar League, 
two games behind Mt. Carmel with three to play. The Longhorns still play both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen dropped to 15-10 and 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a lot of close games, so this was good for us," Hargrave said. 
"I think we really needed this game to get ready for the playoffs. It was good 
for George to pitch in a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
Hadden is 6-3 with a 2.41 earned-run average. He struck out seven Wednesday and 
walked none. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns helped Hadden by scoring in each of the first three innings. They 
took a 2-0 lead with two unearned runs in the first inning after two outs. 
</P>
<P>
RBV executed the fundamentals in the second to make it 3-0. Hank Perry's 
walked, Scott Lyons bunted and Jason Schmeiser hit an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, the Longhorns stole a run. James Gore singled. After one out, 
Gore stole second and third, then scored on Kevin Lippert's fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen scored single runs in the fourth and fifth innings. MARTIN

URBAN DESIGN: THE SHAPE OF U.S. CITIES WAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN AT THE UCSD

<P>
It's time to give the cities back to the people. 
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's "Shaping the City" symposium in UC San Diego's Mandeville 
Auditorium, four internationally respected speakers hit relentlessly on the 
problems that those who shape cities -- architects, urban designers, planners, 
developers, politicians -- must solve if our planet, our country and Southern 
California are to be saved from self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The day served as a powerful warning that all is not well in U. S. cities. The 
heavy dose of social awareness came as a pleasant surprise, considering that 
last year's inaugural symposium was dominated by bold, egotistical designs 
rather than proposed answers to society's ills. Both events were intended as 
the single most visible means of generating interest in the university's new 
architecture school, scheduled to open in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
This year's special guests' greatest works harmonize with cities. Uniformly, 
they called upon architects to think first of the people who use their 
buildings, instead of the grand illusions they can create. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles architect Barton Myers is a professor at UCLA and heads his own 
large architecture firm. 
</P>
<P>
Urban planner and architect Stanton Eckstut has become legendary in 
architectural circles in recent years for his people-oriented master plan for 
Battery Park City, a huge development on the edge of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Developer James Rouse has built huge retail projects, often on waterfronts, 
that have helped revitalize such cities as Boston, Philadelphia and Tampa and 
Orlando, Fla. Having retired from development, he founded the Enterprise 
Foundation in 1982, which has the lofty goal of housing all of America's 
estimated 30 million poor people within the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco architect and urban planner Daniel Solomon has written design 
guidelines for cities in California and Arizona. Much of his work has 
reintroduced courtyards and other human features to multifamily housing. 
</P>
<P>
(An exhibition of the speakers' work will be in the campus' Mandeville Gallery 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Introductions and transitions between speakers were handled by moderator 
Richard Bender, former dean of the College of Environmental Design at the 
University of California, Berkeley, who played prominent roles in writing a new 
master plan for UC San Diego and setting up the new architecture school. 
</P>
<P>
Bender set up the day's agenda by introducing two ways of viewing the 
contemporary city: "catastrophic" and "optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
"Recently, most of what they're building is junk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Having acknowledged extensive problems in today's cities, including foul air, 
Bender said that, even so, he is not pessimistic. New technologies in biology, 
materials and social and ecological awareness, if properly applied, can serve 
as "the impetus for a new generation of innovation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Myers called for a "regional collective effort" from Santa Barbara to San 
Diego, a big-picture government coalition to coordinate the future of Southern 
California's 200 cities. He said impoverished state and local governments have 
foisted community planning on developers, and that some new form of regional 
government needs to take back this responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
He coined the term vacant lottery to refer to existing zoning and planning 
ordinances "so crude and blunt" that they have a minuscule chance of producing 
good cities. 
</P>
<P>
Bad planning, not density and rapid growth, is the problem, Myers said, noting 
that, during the 19th Century, London doubled its population gracefully in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Myers derided the 1960s notion of urban renewal through scraping down blocks of 
small, old buildings and replacing them with block-size developments. He called 
for a blend of old and new, a move away from skyscrapers as the dominant 
downtown building type. Allowing more and smaller developments, instead of 
mega-block monsters, would let more people participate in making cities, and 
this diversity would be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
In his idealized vision, Southern California could become an efficient series 
of small- and medium-size towns, knitted together by more efficient 
transportation systems. 
</P>
<P>
Eckstut carried on the theme of designing cities with their users in mind, with 
wonderful public spaces and street-scapes, not grandstanding buildings, as the 
most important goal for architects and planners. 
</P>
<P>
An explanation of his work on Battery Park City underscored how Eckstut feels 
about architecture. He set out to make a "real city, not an attraction." Noting 
that the most successful buildings surrounding Central Park are the most 
retrained, he said, "New Yorkers rely on buildings which are not famous." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of Battery Park City's 92 acres were left as public open space, 
the most significant being a waterfront esplanade for pedestrians. Both cars 
and pedestrians move through the project; Eckstut believes urban vitality is 
enhanced by carefully mingling the two. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strongest evidence of Eckstut's success in creating a peaceful, 
homey urban environment at Battery Park City is the building designed by 
architect Charles Moore, who has a tendency toward cartoonish abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are not moved by it," Eckstut said of Moore's low-key New York 
building, "and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Rouse, at 76 the senior expert at the conference, summed up his philosophy when 
he said that "it's not shape, form, space, structure. It's people we've got to 
be building for." 
</P>
<P>
His talk, the only one presented without the aid of slides, came off more as a 
moving sermon on social responsibility than the practical advice handed down by 
other speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse quoted these figures to make his point about the low-income housing 
crisis: a 26% annual increase in the nation's homeless, of which there are now 
perhaps 750,000; an estimated 42,000 people in Los Angeles sleeping in cars, 
garages and other makeshift shelters; abut 16 million American households 
surviving on less than $10,000 a year, half of which goes toward rent. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have got to change in America," Rouse said. "The people at the bottom 
have to become more important than the people at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon drew applause when he opened by describing the "problem of affluence, 
the poverty of what affluence has bought," the mediocrity of expensive new 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Local notables on hand included San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts, San 
Diego City Architect Mike Stepner, developer Ernest Hahn, Centre City 
Development Corp. Executive Vice President Pam Hamilton and home builder Tawfiq 
Khoury. 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, Bender led the four featured speakers through a joint discussion 
with the new dean of the UCSD architecture school, Adele Naude Santos, who was 
sitting in to glean ideas for the new school. 
</P>
<P>
Santos stressed her commitment to making the school a "think tank" for solving 
social problems, and an active part of the community, rather than an "elitist, 
hermetic school sitting on top of the mesa." 
</P>
<P>
One left with some hope that, during the '90s, more architects will use their 
talents to address pressing urban problems they often ignored during the '80s.

COLLECTION CONTEST'S A TITLE FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD HAUGAARD, Haugaard is a Monrovia free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Student book collections tend to feature such titles as "College Math for 
Management, Life and Social Sciences" or "Macroeconomics." 
</P>
<P>
Ten Scripps College seniors have taken a more individualistic approach. 
</P>
<P>
The students, vying for the annual Slocum Award for Student Libraries, have 
amassed collections with themes as specialized as "The Soul Story of New 
Mexico" and "Moving Through Time: Reflections on Traditions and Innovations in 
Dance." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Snyder's collection, which she calls "Writers I Have Known and Loved," 
is devoted strictly to volumes by authors Snyder has met. 
</P>
<P>
The student book collections, each composed of about 25 volumes, are now on 
display at the Claremont college's Denison Library and will be exhibited 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two students will be named to share the $300 prize. A panel of 
judges, including two professors and an antiquarian bookseller, will assess 
each collection for breadth, potential for growth and demonstration of the 
collector's "enthusiasm and satisfaction of ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Harvey Sahak, Denison librarian, said the award was established by Myles 
Standish Slocum, a book collector descended from the Myles Standish of Pilgrim 
fame. Slocum, the father of two Scripps students, instituted the award in 1935 
to honor the senior, or seniors, who gathered the best collection of books 
during a four-year stay at the women's college, Sahak said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad started having so much fun he wanted to inspire others to make a point of 
collecting," said one of Slocum's daughters, Florence Slocum Wilson. After 
their father's death, Wilson and her sister endowed the fund that pays the 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Slocum Award contenders have entered collections including an 
array of cookbooks with an emphasis on chocolate cake; Canadian works focusing 
on Nova Scotia, and a selection of previously banned books. 
</P>
<P>
This year's crop is no less idiosyncratic. For her "Books on My Hispanic 
Culture" collection, sociology major Diana Diaz combined volumes demonstrating 
connections between North American and Hispanic cultures. 
</P>
<P>
In an essay accompanying her entry, she wrote that she learned American ways at 
school and traditional Mexican ways at home. "I always took for granted that 
these two worlds were not meant to be together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Titles in her bilingual collection include "The House on Mango Street" by 
Sandra Cisneros and "La Muerte de Artemio Cruz" by Carlos Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Saiki's "The Soul Story of New Mexico" stems from her upbringing, too. 
Saiki, who grew up in New Mexico, where her father worked on a Navajo Indian 
reservation, wrote that the books in her collection "awakened me to the 
realities of the New Mexican Indians, a realization not present when I was a 
child." 
</P>
<P>
Zarmineh Rab also drew on her heritage in amassing her collection, "Islamic 
Traditions and Politics in the Middle East." Rab, a political science major, 
said her love of books was inspired by her grandfather, Khawaja Nazimuddin, the 
prime minister of Pakistan from 1951 to 1953, who collected a vast library in 
the family palace. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, an English major, took the active approach in collecting volumes for 
her entry, "Writers I Have Known and Loved." Once, she said, she pulled strings 
to get herself invited to a dinner honoring British novelist Margaret Drabble, 
whose "Jerusalem the Golden" is part of the collection. Another time, she 
chauffeured feminist author Betty Friedan to and from a lecture at Scripps. She 
also drove science fiction writer Octavia Butler, whose autographed copy of 
"Imago" is on display. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the influence of the Slocum Award has extended beyond their college 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannette Larson, a second-place winner in 1987 for her collection of 
children's books, said the award may have helped her get her job as assistant 
editor of children's books at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Swan, coordinator of a used-book store run by the Friends of the South 
Pasadena Public Library, won the award in 1952 for her collection of children's 
books. Now her collection has grown to between 500 and 700 books -- financed in 
the earliest stages by the Slocum Award, then $50.

<TEXT>

"Every time a decent martial arts movie comes out, it gives us a shot in the 
arm," said Bernie Krasnoo, owner of Sherman Oaks Karate Studio. The most recent 
release -- "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" -- created a small flurry of interest 
in the martial arts among the younger set. 
</P>
<P>
"This time of year is pretty slow, but we had an unexpected number of sign-ups 
among the 4-, 5- and 6-year-olds," Krasnoo said. "Everybody wants to be a ninja 
turtle now. The real little ones like it because of the turtle characters." 
</P>
<P>
While being a ninja turtle is a glamorous fantasy, becoming one is grueling 
hard work. "The kids find out real quick that they have to work, and some of 
them don't like the discipline that's involved," Krasnoo said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Frank Dux, owner of Frank Dux's Samurai Connection in North 
Hollywood, the martial arts industry is coming out of a slump. "The martial 
arts industry is really tied into the film industry. When good martial arts 
movies dry up, so does our industry," he said. "We were in a depression for 
several years, but when the movie 'Bloodsport' was released on video in 1989, 
it actually saved the industry." 
</P>
<P>
It is Dux's dream for teen-agers to turn to martial arts rather than to gangs. 
"It helps you find the courage and strength to stand up to adversity and to 
find value in yourself -- it improves your self-esteem. Most people do drugs 
because they don't have any self-esteem. But with the martial arts, you find it 
within yourself."

You Mean It's This Sunday?

<P>
If mothers only knew what went on behind the scenes while their offspring were 
purchasing their Mother's Day flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually toward Friday and Saturday, if the flowers are being sent out of the 
area, the customers start saying, 'Just send anything, as long as it gets 
there,' " designer Caralyn deJong of Granada Hills Florist said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Several florists report that another on-the-job talent they must possess is the 
ability to write a good card. "People always ask for help in writing the card 
or they ask what everybody else is saying," deJong said. 
</P>
<P>
Floral designer Lee Burcher of Rambling Rose Florist in Woodland Hills and 
Warner Center refers to Mother's Day as "Guilt Day." 
</P>
<P>
"So many people never send flowers to their mothers during the year, so then on 
this one special day, they make up for it," he said. "And the later they are 
with placing their order, the more they spend on the flowers." 
</P>
<P>
The Monday after Mother's Day offers no respite. "We still get a lot of orders 
on Monday," noted Marty Lavitt, owner of the Wild Flower in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
To help the exceedingly tardy shopper, some shops are open on Mother's Day. 
"One of the few things that's kind of a bummer about having a flower shop is 
that you have to be open on the major holidays," Lavitt said. "But it's not 
like working in the complaint department. People who buy flowers are the nicest 
people in the world. It's not like mean people buying flowers for other mean 
people."

Just What California Needs 
</P>
<P>
Yet another variation of license plate styles has been added to the soup and 
began appearing on cars this month. "It's called the Olympic Training Center 
license and it was issued in an effort to raise money for the center in San 
Diego," said Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman Bill Gengler. The center 
will be apportioned $100 of the plate's $135 cost. 
</P>
<P>
California is rather unusual in that it has five basic license plate designs, 
Gengler noted. A large number of specialty designs exist that build on these 
standard styles. The new training center design, for example, is a variation on 
the basic Olympic plate. "There's everything from the Pearl Harbor Survivors 
plate, the Purple Heart plate, the historical vehicle license plate, the 
disabled-person motorcycle plate . . . the list goes on and on," Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV collects more than $4 billion in fees and registrations annually, 
according to Gengler. "We're a collection agency," he said. "About 55% of the 
money we collect goes right back to the local city or county government where a 
car is garaged. The California Highway Patrol gets 15%, the DMV gets 10% and 
there are a variety of smaller allocations." 
</P>
<P>
One tip passed along by Gengler is the method for identifying whether a car 
parked in handicapped parking legally belongs there. "A plate for disabled 
persons or disabled veterans will have a DP or a DV on it," he said. 
</P>

"I hope this summer, when I buy my son a Dick Tracy T-shirt, I can get a rebate 
if I turn in his Batman T-shirt."

BICYCLING: 100 RIDERS WILL FOLLOW FIVE CROSS-COUNTRY ROUTES TO RAISE MONEY FOR 
LOCALLY INITIATED PROJECTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

They remember the little-known towns along America's rural highways: De Quincy, 
La., or Hamlet, N.C., or St. Charles, Minn. They talk about riding their 
bicycles 70 miles a day, about sleeping in YMCAs, high-school gymnasiums or 
private homes, about pitching in to help community groups paint fences or feed 
the homeless. And mostly they recall their wonderful conversations with 
Americans of every stripe. 
</P>
<P>
They are the alumni of a phenomenon called Bike-Aid, a cross-country bicycle 
trip gearing up for its fifth summer. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some really beautiful people out there," says Judi Fox, a recent 
graduate in economics from UC San Diego. "I felt much more American at the end 
of this trip -- and I also felt that I really loved the American people." 
</P>
<P>
For Fox, "this trip" was last summer's five-week, 2,000-mile ride from Austin, 
Tex., to Washington with 12 other bicyclists. The goal: to raise money for 
locally initiated development projects in Third World countries funded by the 
Overseas Development Network, Bike-Aid's parent organization. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, nearly 400 cyclists, ranging from teen-agers to a 61-year-old 
grandmother from Miami, have ridden up mountains and across windy plains -- and 
raised more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 bikers who will participate this summer, riding five different 
cross-country routes to the nation's capital (from Seattle; Portland, Ore.; San 
Francisco; Los Angeles and Austin), are each asked to solicit $2,000 in pledges 
from friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Like other large-scale events -- the 1985 Live-Aid concert to aid victims of 
Ethiopian famine and the 1986 Hands Across America effort, which contributed 
funds to the homeless and needy -- Bike-Aid seeks to raise local and national 
awareness about overseas problems and contribute funds for grass-roots 
development projects. 
</P>
<P>
The ride is not a race, say the organizers, but a chance to learn about 
community challenges and successes here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty intense experience," says Cathy McGovern, one of two 
coordinators for this year's Bike-Aid, which begins June 17 (July 16 from 
Austin) and ends Aug. 21 at the Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The bikers take pride in their contributions to Third World development. They 
also take a few layover days along the way to work on projects in host 
communities: McGovern remembers the Sunday they agreed to "paint a porch in 
south Chicago," only to discover that the porch was a three-tiered structure on 
a refurbished tenement that took a squad of bicyclists more than a day to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever they go, says Benay Lazo, the other Bike-Aid coordinator at the 
group's San Francisco office, the bikers make a lasting impression. "They touch 
and inspire people in the host communities," she says, recalling her own 
experiences with after-dinner community meetings and noontime conversations 
with passers-by at country stores. She says the funds raised and sent overseas 
can have a significant effect. But the real benefit, she insists, lies in "what 
happens to the cyclist." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Kahrl, a recent Harvard University graduate who rode in both 1988 and 1989 
and now coaches track in Bath, Maine, agrees. "I would say I learned to care," 
he says when asked how the experience changed him. "I saw a lot of people 
helping others -- people who had very little to start with, dedicating their 
lives to bettering the lot of others rather than going to Wall Street and 
earning a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
For Andy Yates, a third-year graduate student in engineering-economic systems 
at Stanford University, the experience provided "a foundation and a personal 
belief about major problems and what would be a good approach to solving them." 
</P>
<P>
What most impressed him, he says, was the fact that "the middle part of the 
country seems to be disappearing quickly. A lot of the small towns, 
particularly the farming communities, are closing up. They used to have two or 
three grocery stores; now they don't have any, and you have to ride maybe 40 
miles to the next big town." 
</P>
<P>
He worries that "if you were to do this ride in 20 years, it might be extremely 
difficult to find small towns along the back roads. You're going to be confined 
to riding along interstates and eating at McDonald's and staying in Motel 6's." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of linking bicycling and third-world development came from Nazir 
Ahmad, who with his younger brother, Kamal, founded ODN in 1982. He seized on 
cycling in part because of the powerful metaphors it presented. 
</P>
<P>
"Cycling, other than walking, is the most common form of transportation in the 
world," he says. He credits the idea of a cross-country student ride to a 
summer trek called Harvard Rides for Life, which followed a single route. ODN 
added multiple routes -- in part, he says, because there is "a tendency to 
think of development as all going the same way, and yet here were those 
different routes going to the same end." 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that most of the nation's decisions about development issues are 
made in East or West Coast power centers, and that "middle America," where the 
cyclists of necessity spend most of their time, often getting "left behind or 
ignored." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he says students needed to learn how to raise funds for causes they 
support. "I have always thought of Bike-Aid's fund-raising as an investment in 
learning," he says. "It's a very empowering process to know that you can raise 
resources to do the things you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
As he raises funds for this summer's ride, Kahrl agrees. "It's not only that we 
can make a difference but that we have to," he says. "People need to care; they 
need to make a difference."

Stephen Hyatt wanted his University of Maine sociology students to understand 
the important clues that can be contained in trash, so he turned them loose on 
five big green trash bags right in his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The trash, collected and screened by Hyatt, included everything from food 
scraps to lottery tickets, beer cans to shampoo bottles. The students came to 
some accurate conclusions in most cases, and some wildly inaccurate conclusions 
in others. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt's point was to show how everyday dumpings can provide broad details of a 
civilization's day-to-day activities. In the past, he said, anthropologists 
often concentrated on tombs that provided much information about a society's 
upper class, but few details about the common people. 
</P>
<P>
To control the exercise, Hyatt put the trash bags together himself, using trash 
from his own home and from the homes of friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"I assembled this trash for specific reasons, and in order not to detract from 
the learning experience I washed all the cans and bottles so that all the trash 
was relatively clean," Hyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Each bag of trash represented a hypothetical family, and each bag contained 
specific clues about the family members. 
</P>
<P>
The class was divided into groups, with teams of five students assigned to each 
bag of trash. 
</P>
<P>
"They examined the trash and tried to make some meaning of the contents," Hyatt 
said. "Then each one was asked to make inferences about the trash." 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt asked the students to draw conclusions about a number of specific 
questions: the size of the household; the age, sex, health and occupations of 
the members; and the food consumed by the different families. 
</P>
<P>
"They were also to try to determine the social status of the household, whether 
they were poor or upper class," Hyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
What surprised Hyatt the most, he said, was the students' attention to food 
scraps and other food-related clues. The students were also very conscious of 
health-related clues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very alert to that, pointing out that this person ate 
low-cholesterol food or drank low-fat milk, and that surprised me," Hyatt said. 
"It also surprised me how often they noticed evidence of food from McDonald's 
or other fast-food places, pointing out that some of the fictitious families 
usually ate well but slipped once in a while and ate fast-food." 
</P>
<P>
Some students interpreted the discovery of aspirin and Tylenol bottles in the 
bags as evidence that the people were living stressful lives and needed relief 
from medication. 
</P>
<P>
He said the students came to interesting conclusions about the lottery tickets 
that he placed in the trash bags. 
</P>
<P>
"Some said that the gambling was probably the result of feelings of poverty and 
desperation," he said. "One student pointed out that a lottery ticket had been 
purchased on Dec. 24, and said it must have been a sad Christmas Eve. He 
related that to desperation, frustration and money problems." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of empty beer cans indicated that the male of the household was 
drinking, even when the household obviously had both male and female members, 
Hyatt said. Some students said it was an indication that the male in the family 
was drinking too much. 
</P>
<P>
"That surprised me in a way," Hyatt said. "Many people now would say that the 
co-eds are drinking as much beer as the males, but the students seemed to think 
that it indicated a male presence." 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt designed his trash bags to represent economically well-off families. But 
many of his students thought the families were poor. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them came to the conclusion that they were worse off than I had 
intended," Hyatt said. "Many of them noticed evidence of clothes purchased in 
discount stores, and thought that indicated poverty. They thought that buying 
no-name food products indicated low incomes. They didn't think that it might be 
a middle-class family that simply wanted to save money." 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt said he plans to repeat the trash exercise in future classes. And at 
least one student said the experiment will change the way she handles her own 
trash in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I never believed that you could find out so much revealing information about 
people simply by examining their trash," she wrote in her research paper. "From 
now on I plan to destroy any personal information before throwing it out."

PIANIST BILLY TAYLOR'S COOL CASTS A CHILL AT CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Taylor's position as one of the most respected figures in jazz is hard to 
dispute. With a long list of musical and academic achievements, as well as his 
high visibility on CBS' "Sunday Morning" show, he may be one of the best-known 
jazz musicians in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's opening night set at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, however, raised the 
question of whether the pianist's peripatetic schedule has begun to blur his 
musical focus. The words that kept coming to mind throughout a mixed bag of 
standards and blues were controlled, slick, smooth and mannered. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has never been a particularly passionate player, but the emotional 
energy of his solos was even more diminished than usual. It was not until he 
reached a closing set of variations on "All The Things You Are" that his 
precise, scale-based playing began to generate any real heat. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier numbers aroused interest primarily for their often novel 
interpretations. " 'A' Train," for example, was driven through a long tunnel 
full of eerie harmonies before it emerged into a loose, pleasant swing. The 
first chorus of "Body and Soul" received a virtuosic, left-hand-only reading 
that would have been more effective had Taylor had fewer problems with his 
digital articulation. 
</P>
<P>
Ballads like "More Than You Know" seemed to trigger the best playing, in part 
because of the smooth carpet of rhythm laid down by bassist Victor Gaskin and 
drummer Bobby Thomas. Gaskin's few solo moments were highlighted by some 
startling, double-stop pizzicato lines, and Thomas's feature on "Caravan" 
dramatically displayed the variety of textures that can be derived from a basic 
drum set by a gifted player. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's long history of contributions to jazz demands respect and support. It 
may be too much to expect his playing to probe a bit deeper, and risk a little 
more. Yet Taylor is good enough and creative enough to keep that wish alive. On 
this night, at least, it was unfulfilled. DON HECKMAN

ALANNAH MYLES HITS ROXY WITH HER BEST SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To say that Alannah Myles is the new Pat Benatar, however accurate, is to do 
both singers a disservice. Before moving on to motherhood and pop 
respectability, Benatar always looked a little out of her element as a Spandex 
queen; Myles, though, is a more natural hard-rocker than Benatar ever was, 
fitting into her chosen role as a saucy mama with lung power as well as she fit 
her skin-tight black bodywear on Monday at the Roxy. 
</P>
<P>
This was Myles' Los Angeles debut, but as a show-woman, the ambitious Canadian 
chanteuse came off as a seasoned performer already at the top of her 
professional form. Alternately feisty, teasing and grinning, Myles dropped to 
her knees and bounded on top of the speakers, her knockout looks and teasing 
sneers sending the males into ga-ga fantasyland and the gals into jealousyland. 
</P>
<P>
Face, figure and insatiable drive aside, Myles also has a voice that can be 
occasionally angelic but more often is an in-your-face blast that sounds 
ruinous to the throat. Why, when she affects that mean-model look and curls her 
lip, she even looks a little like Elvis -- subject of her recent, bluesy, No. 1 
hit "Black Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
But depth? None of her other pop-metal songs are remotely in the same league, 
and if Myles stops somewhat short of overtly selling sex as a weapon, she 
doesn't have much else of substance to pitch yet. Perhaps we should be grateful 
these days for a new female singer who can sing, but the sheer, shallow 
calculation that goes into Myles' act makes the effort finally as unendearing 
and impersonal as it is viscerally impressive. CHRIS WILLMAN

ROTTERDAM POSSE ROCKS THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best rock 'n' roll has always been characterized by a willingness to flirt 
with anarchy. Hendrix was most amazing when he snatched songs back from the 
brink of chaos; so in their way were the Stones, James Brown and the Velvet 
Underground. 
</P>
<P>
Punk-rock bands, the Sex Pistols and the Germs, raised the chaotic moment to an 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the last band you would have expected to make great rock 'n' roll was a 
young funk band from Holland unpromisingly named Urban Dance Squad, but at the 
Whisky on Tuesday, the Rotterdam posse rocked the house. 
</P>
<P>
Ticky-ticky house beats floated from a turntable, while the guitarist jammed 
(bits of distortion, shards of wah-wah, Richie Blackmore squeals) over the 
percolating drums, whucka-whucka deejay scratching and steady bass. Then wham! 
the twitching bits of rhythm coalesced into a unison power riff whose impact 
was trebled by the contrast to what preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
"Singer" Rudeboy feinted and jabbed like a boxer (his wrists were even taped), 
flicking his wireless mike back and forth like something Rocky would have done 
between the push-ups and the session with the meat, swigging Evian instead of 
Budweiser, rapping rapid-fire, barely accented English -- just how the Beastie 
Boys' King Ad-Rock might sound if he had a Dutch uncle. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious comparison is to the Red Hot Chili Peppers (who were in the 
audience), but Urban Dance Squad is more hip-hop than the Chilis' funk.

TEAR-DRENCHED TUNES FROM TORCHY FORDHAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You may walk into a Julia Fordham show whistling a happy tune, but don't expect 
to leave that way. The young singer-songwriter will wipe that smile off your 
face -- fast. 
</P>
<P>
She's a compelling singer who infuses her songs with as much ache and pain as 
possible, but Fordham, who played the Henry Fonda Theatre on Monday, also makes 
an impact with a style that's subtle and minimalist. Songs like "Girlfriend" 
and "Porcelain" are intensely personal tales that probe the sad, painful side 
of romance. 
</P>
<P>
Large stretches of the show allowed you to wallow in unrelieved gloom. But it 
wasn't an unpleasant experience. Fordham is like one of those old-fashioned 
torch singers from the '20s and '30s who could make those tear-drenched songs 
very appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Though backed by a five-piece band in the 90-minute show, she sang some songs 
accompanied by just piano -- in the classic torch-singer mode. The most 
distinctive aspect of her style is her ability to flit up and down her range in 
the course of one phrase, from her brawny lower register to those crystal-clear 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
Her best song was one of her encore numbers, "Happy Ever After." Despite the 
title, it's not, of course, a happy tune. DENNIS HUNT

BEST BETS: A 7-COURSE CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the great pleasures in life, of course, is food. And what could be more 
pleasurable than a professionally prepared gourmet dinner? Well, a seven-course 
culinary delight prepared by five chefs. 
</P>
<P>
One might expect such a souper to carry a sizable bill. But if proceeds benefit 
a deserving cause, wouldn't it be worth it? 
</P>
<P>
"The Fifth Annual Ultimate Dining Experience" on May 20 at the Hyatt Westlake 
Plaza is such an event. For $75 a plate, patrons can enjoy dishes such as 
charred lavender and black pepper ahi, smoked chicken cannelloni and poached 
veal tenderloin with saffron-truffle sauce. The worthy cause: Conejo Valley 
Senior Concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"The evening is all about relaxation," Senior Concerns Executive Director Don 
Hegarty Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Sip wine and listen to a classical guitarist strum in the background. As each 
dish is served, it will be introduced by the chef responsible for the course. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds will go to Meals on Wheels and the Fitzgerald House, both operated by 
Senior Concerns. Meals on Wheels delivers thousands of meals to housebound 
Conejo Valley senior citizens each year. The Fitzgerald House is a day-care 
center that provides frail senior citizens with opportunities to make friends 
and enjoy a variety of activities. 
</P>
<P>
The reservation deadline is Tuesday. For information, call 529-5676. The Hyatt 
Westlake Plaza is at 880 E. Westlake Blvd., Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>

PLENTY OF GASPS, LAUGHS AT ANIMAL SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students at the Exotic Animal Training and Management Program at Moorpark 
College get plenty of opportunities to share what they know about their 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Regularly scheduled animal shows are held at 3 p.m. each Sunday at the animal 
compound's outdoor stage, 7075 Campus Park Drive, at the west end of California 
118. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $2 for adults, $1 for children 12 and under. Special birthday 
shows can be scheduled in which a llama, baboon, performing seal and a variety 
of animals are part of an ensemble cast of entertainers. Special shows for 
classes of schoolchildren can also be arranged. The animals have appeared at 
grand openings and other special events. Call 378-1441 for additional 
information and rates. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent presentation for nearly 200 kindergarten children, the youngsters 
gasped at a vulture and a few let out some "yuks" and "oohs" when Kim Smith, 
the trainer, said the birds are bald so that they don't get bloody and dirty 
when they stick their heads inside a carcass. Melissa Dawson, 3, said she liked 
the sheep the best. But not all children are as easily impressed. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Doria, the program's assistant director, recalled the time a mother in 
Beverly Hills was planning a party for her young son. "She put the boy on the 
phone so that I could tell him all the animals we were bringing," Doria said. 
"I told him, 'We'll have a sea lion and a llama and a pony' and all these other 
great animals. All he said was, 'Oh, no elephant?' "

"I LIKE MY YEARS," SAYS ACTOR JEFF COREY. "I LIKE MY AMASSED EXPERIENCES."

Veteran film and TV actor Jeff Corey and his ceramist wife Hope Corey invite 
their three daughters, three sons-in-law and six grandchildren to stay with 
them at their Ojai vacation house as often as possible. Jeff and Hope call it 
"creating memories." 
</P>
<P>
"Our twin grandsons Ben and Nat are going to remember making pots and baking 
them in Grandma's kiln," Hope says. Jeff Corey appreciates his role as 
paterfamilias perhaps even more than his acting roles. He claims one of the 
reasons he doesn't mind aging is that he's "building the future." 
</P>
<P>
"I like my years," says the gaunt actor. "I like big books, long novels with 
many chapters. I have many chapters. I love my real age, but in Hollywood it 
affects getting a job. Therefore, you don't mention age." 
</P>
<P>
"I like my amassed experiences," he says. "After all, I can remember when horse 
manure was an impediment to our games in the street. I studied by gaslight. And 
I listened to the Dempsey-Carpentier fight on a crystal set." 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite memory is the first time I saw Hopie. I wooed her in New York. You 
could walk around Central Park freely in those days and not worry. Although it 
hurts, I like to remember when Evie, our oldest, was only 3 weeks old. It was 
the war, and Hopie drove me to the Pantages Theatre, where the bus waited, the 
bus that would take me to boot camp." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff made me realize I like my years too, not only my memories, but how I've 
experienced life. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five years ago Jim Murray and I were cub reporters on the Los Angeles 
Examiner. Yes -- the same Jim Murray who is now a veteran sports columnist for 
the Los Angeles Times and who just received the Pulitzer Prize for 
distinguished commentary. He and I got our basic training from Jim Richardson, 
one of the last of the tough, angry "Front Page" city editors. It was World War 
II and Richardson had trained so many reporters only to have them drafted that 
he hired a girl. Me. 
</P>
<P>
To be the only female in that smoky, jokey sea of macho wouldn't have been easy 
even if Jim Richardson and the Club Car Boys hadn't discovered my claims to 
newspaper experience were false. 
</P>
<P>
The next to last night of my first week on the paper, I went to supper as 
usual. When I came out, I saw a boy and a dog, the only signs of life on dark 
South Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
What was a little boy doing in downtown L.A. at night alone? 
</P>
<P>
The boy said he'd just gotten his dog out of the pound. He'd come by bus from 
Santa Monica. He had a nickel for the return ride, but bus drivers wouldn't 
take the dog. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother works in a war plant. Our neighbor was supposed to keep the dog for 
us. My father . . ." his voice trailed off. His father, a serviceman, had just 
been killed overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On my way into the Examiner with the boy, I was stopped by Jim Murray. "I 
wouldn't bring that mangy dog in here if I were you," he advised. "You're 
already hanging by a thread." I took the boy and dog to the photography room. 
Abby, a photographer, the only one who had befriended me during that week, put 
them on a table and covered them with a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
I wrote the story, put it on the desk of the night editor, and asked to leave 
early. I drove the boy and dog back to Santa Monica. The next day when I opened 
the city room door, I was greeted by Richardson's loud, angry bark. "You!" 
</P>
<P>
He threw four telegrams at me: "Give the boy-dog story a by-line"; a second, 
"Give the reporter a bonus and tell him I'm watching his career"; a third, 
"Well, tell her I'm watching her career"; and a fourth, "Give boy and dog 
whatever they need." All were signed, "The Chief." 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to fire you today," Richardson said gruffly. "With Mr. Hearst 
taking an interest in you, I can't. I'm stuck with you. But I can make your 
life a holy hell. And I will. I'll give you every damn boy-dog, girl-cat story 
-- until you quit in despair!" 
</P>
<P>
With that, he tossed the newspaper at me. On the first page of the second 
section was "The Boy and the Dog," Abby's photo of them asleep covering the top 
half of the page and beneath, occupying the whole bottom half of the page, was 
my story. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't quit. I learned. Richardson taught me. And he finally gave me good 
stories: Mrs. Peete on Death Row; the Black Dahlia Murder Case. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Corey was right when he said, "Even if you don't remember where you left 
your eyeglasses, you can remember and enjoy what you were doing 40 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
If Jeff likes his years, it's not just because he likes his memories. 
Everything he does and feels today is colored by the past. His experience as an 
actor and as a man is with him whether he's teaching, acting or bringing in the 
firewood. What gives us satisfaction is we're aware that our perception of the 
world is truer and richer because of our years. And there's the added pleasure 
of being able to pass this on.

Ann Jones is confident that she is on the way to realizing her dream of a 
career in politics. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Associated Students president of Oxnard College is one of 92 
college sophomores in the country to be awarded the Harry S. Truman 
Scholarship. The maximum $7,000 per year that the scholarship carries will 
enable Jones to attend UC Santa Barbara next fall, where she will major in 
sociology and political science. 
</P>
<P>
And her family is very supportive. Very, very supportive. Most of them attend 
Oxnard College with her -- there's daughter Kaysha, sons Keenan and Kendall and 
mom, yes mom, Edna McBride. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom and I are taking biology class together. We sit right next to each other," 
said Ann Jones. "We're lab partners. I find everything in the microscope 
because she says her eyes aren't that good, and she draws everything." 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, Jones and her mother will graduate together in June. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be surprised if you have a hard time getting through to the Thousand Oaks 
Library today. It's the first day to sign up for the library's extremely 
popular "Baseball Card and Comic Book Exchange," with the emphasis on cards, 
set May 24. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this card exchange different? No adults allowed. In fact, no one 
older than 16 allowed. "We always get a lot of calls from adults, but it 
wouldn't be fair to the kids," Librarian Janice Arcuria said. "Actually, it may 
or may not be fair to the kids. Some may be more astute than the adults." 
</P>
<P>
Though no money changes hands, Arcuria said the kids are well aware of the 
monetary value of their property. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the kids bring their own price books," she said. "We even heard 
stories about one kid financing a car with baseball card sales." 
</P>
<P>
But back to the real reason for the exchange.

By the way, Bob Hanks, owner of Big Bob's Baseball Cards in Fillmore, knows 
what all those preteens and early teens know . . . that Bo Jackson cards are 
the hottest on the market these days, especially the ones made by the Score 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"It's because of the rumored suing going on between Nike and Score," he said. 
"The kids know that something is up." (The dispute is over the use of a picture 
of Jackson that appears on a Nike billboard and on his Score card.) 
</P>
<P>
But Bo isn't the only one who knows fame around here. "Will Clark, Rickey 
Henderson and Dave Stewart are popular," Hanks said. "A lot of kids here are 
Oakland fans. The Dodgers are still a favorite, but Oakland is better."

With at least three senior proms planned this weekend in Ventura County, a lot 
of teen-agers will be renting limousines for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
So, as a public service, we spoke with James Fowler of Home James Limousine 
Service in Ventura and got some tips on tipping: 
</P>
<P>
How much to tip the driver: Fowler said he expects at least 15% of the average 
$45 an hour charge. But he wouldn't mind more. The biggest tip he's ever 
gotten? "Two hundred dollars," he said. "Actually, I got a bigger one here 
about two weeks ago, but the check bounced." LEO SMITH

CABBAGE, RED OR GREEN, LASTS PRACTICALLY FOREVER -- OR AT LEAST UNTIL IT'S 
PREPARED AS AN APPETIZING DISH.

Cabbage was cultivated as early as 2000 B.C. That's not only historically 
significant, that's a lot of cole slaw. And locally, cabbage has lost none of 
its appeal over time. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County, which grows more than 3,000 acres of cabbage, is the largest 
cabbage producer in the state, said Swede Severson, a statistician with the 
California Agricultural Statistics Service. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of big companies here in the county that supply the entire 
nation with cabbage," said Steve Tamai, a small grower in Oxnard. "There's a 
big market, and these companies are here to meet it." The demand for cabbage, 
he said, has stayed pretty stable. 
</P>
<P>
One of the vegetable's main assets is its extremely long shelf life, Tamai 
said. "Cabbage can last forever if it's stored in a cooler." 
</P>
<P>
Tamai recommends a Japanese appetizer that is made by mixing salt with shredded 
cabbage and letting it sit in the icebox for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers who purchase head start cabbage, the most popular variety, should look 
for a dark green color, Tamai said. "If it's sort of pale, it probably means 
it's been sitting there for some time." But Tamai said that color is not always 
a true indicator of freshness. "The only way you can really make sure it's 
fresh," he said, is to buy it and eat it. 
</P>
<P>
The older a cabbage is, the more bitter it tastes, said Lucy Vanoni, a grower 
in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
Vanoni, who just finished harvesting her last crop of red cabbage, recommended 
red over green because "when you go to cook it or prepare it, the red cabbage 
isn't as odorous." 
</P>
<P>
But Vanoni cautioned against using red cabbage when stir-frying. "It discolors 
all your other vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
Vanoni recommends sauteing a small onion, sliced or chopped, in a tablespoon of 
olive oil or two slices of bacon, then adding cabbage, a tablespoon of soy 
sauce and two tablespoons of honey or brown sugar and letting it steam for 10 
to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want cabbage for cole slaw or cooking, you want a really tight, heavy 
head," Vanoni said. "If you want it for stuffing, you want it loose so you can 
peel the leaves off easily." 
</P>
<P>
Vanoni also said the outer cabbage leaves make a good container for chips and 
dip, and for stuffing. Both green and red cabbage are available at the Ventura 
Farmers' Market, said Karen Collins, the market manager. "Squashes are also 
starting to come in, and they go fast. We also have a few weeks left of 
asparagus." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers looking for cheese might try some Italian imports at Mrs. Gooch's in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a Reggiano Parmesan that's a very hard, dry cheese. It's well-aged, 
with a nice bite to it," said Mark Swanson, store manager. 
</P>
<P>
Also available from Italy is Pecorino Romano, which is a more mellow, dry 
cheese, made from sheep's milk, Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
From Georgia are the "notoriously sweet" Vidalia brown onions, Swanson said. He 
recommends using them in salads, sandwiches and for sauteing. 
</P>
<P>
Fish lovers can start looking forward to some fresh king salmon, because salmon 
season just opened, said Ed Lusk, co-owner of Cal Pacifica Seafood in Ventura. 
"Salmon," he said, "like to come into the deep water canyons off of Port 
Hueneme." 
</P>
<P>
Salmon season in the area lasts about four to six weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Halibut, Pacific red snapper and Santa Barbara spot prawns, said Lusk, are also 
good local catches. PEGGY Y. LEE

MAJOR MALIBU QUAKE POSSIBLE, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New data indicates that a complex fault system along the Malibu coast is both 
active and capable of causing a major earthquake of magnitude 6 or 7, two 
geologists who have closely studied the area warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The warning, backed up by findings from other geologists, may prompt the 
California Coastal Commission to ask the state to designate the Malibu coast a 
"special study zone" in which development would be tightly regulated because of 
the seismic danger. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the warning, one commissioner urged her colleagues to press for 
the designation, and commission Executive Director Peter Douglas said a letter 
already is being drafted to send to the state if the commission votes to move 
forward with the request. 
</P>
<P>
Former State Geologist James E. Slosson told the commission at a special 
workshop in Marina del Rey that recent geologic findings show such a 
designation is appropriate for Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
With one exception, the 10 geologists who also appeared before the commission 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Slosson, who has studied the area for 30 years, said a major quake along the 
Malibu coast fault zone -- previously thought to be inactive -- could cause 
extensive property damage and threaten lives by triggering "very serious" 
landslides and rock falls along Pacific Coast Highway and Malibu Canyon Road. 
The rocks along the coastline, he said, are "highly shattered and susceptible 
to failure in a major earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Slosson likened the danger to that posed by the 
Newport-Inglewood fault, which runs north to south across Los Angeles and 
Orange counties and caused the devastating Long Beach earthquake in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
The second geologist, Gary Greene of the U.S. Geological Survey, said that 
based on historical data the Malibu coast fault system is probably capable of a 
magnitude 6 earthquake and "it could be higher." 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake registering 5.7 and centered off Point Mugu caused more than 
$1-million damage in the Oxnard-Ventura area in February, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, geologists had not focused on the potential magnitude of a temblor 
from the Malibu fault because it was thought to be inactive. 
</P>
<P>
But the recent discoveries have lead Greene and others to the conclusion that 
"we are dealing with a fairly active seismic zone." 
</P>
<P>
Greene said recent evidence indicates there is more than one fault in the 
Malibu area. "My feeling is it is a system of . . . maybe a half-dozen faults." 
</P>
<P>
Geologists have known of the main Malibu fault for many years. But in the last 
few years, evidence has been found to indicate that it is active and more 
extensive than previously realized. Among the significant recent discoveries 
are two splays or splinter faults off the main Malibu fault that have been 
active within the last 11,000 years -- the benchmark for what constitutes an 
"active" fault in California. 
</P>
<P>
The first discovery of an active splinter fault, in 1987, forced General Motors 
Corp. to abandon plans for construction of an $11-million advanced design 
center across Pacific Coast Highway from Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
And in recent months, digging at the site of a single-family home in Latigo 
Canyon also yielded evidence of an active fault. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the Alquist-Priolo Act, passed by the Legislature after the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake, the state geologist is required to designate special 
zones along known earthquake faults in California. The law prevents 
construction of buildings for human occupancy within 50 feet of an active 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, who lives in Malibu, urged her 
colleagues to press for such a designation. The matter is expected to be 
considered at the commission's meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Cobarrubias, geologist for the city of Los Angeles, said he has seen enough 
evidence to convince him that a special study zone is needed in Malibu. "The 
right thing to do would be to recommend to the state that the area be zoned as 
a special study zone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach private geologist Roy Shlemon said the new information "strongly 
suggests" that two splays of the Malibu coast fault zone are "probably active." 
</P>
<P>
But geologist Howard Spellman said he does not believe enough evidence has been 
collected to justify a special study zone. Instead, he suggested that the 
Coastal Commission deal with projects in Malibu on a case-by-case basis. "I 
don't think it should be zoned indiscriminately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In their testimony, the geologists told the commission that the Malibu fault 
zone runs parallel to the coastline, onshore in some areas and slightly 
offshore in others. Federal geologist Greene described it as a "thrust fault," 
in which one section of the earth's crust is moving vertically relative to the 
other. This contrasts with a "strike-slip fault," such as the San Andreas, in 
which the two sections move laterally. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said it is possible that the Malibu fault system ties in with the Santa 
Cruz Island fault, which runs beneath the ocean off the Santa Barbara County 
coast. If so, Greene suggested, the system could be "very significant as far as 
a serious hazard."

CITY COUNCIL FACES MONEY SQUEEZE, OKS TAX INCREASES; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: PACKAGE WILL INCLUDE A 10% LEVY ON PARKING FEES. BUSINESS TAXES AND 
TRASH COLLECTION CHARGES ALSO WILL RISE. 
</P>

<P>
Facing what officials call the tightest financial squeeze in years, the Los 
Angeles City Council agreed Wednesday to impose a package of tax increases that 
will tap the pocketbooks of millions of residents, commuters and business 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Among the tax hikes, which were proposed by Mayor Tom Bradley, will be a 
first-ever 10% levy on parking, as well as boosts in business taxes and trash 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also agreed to across-the-board cuts in salary expenses that 
went even deeper than Bradley's $3.6-billion 1990-91 budget. They took the 
action in response to reports from financial analysts who said that the mayor's 
plan, coupled with sluggish revenue increases, could trigger a $100-million 
deficit and a severe financial crisis next year. 
</P>
<P>
Whether layoffs would occur was not immediately clear, but Bradley said his 
budget would lead to reductions in after-school programs, tree trimming, 
library book purchases and summer swimming programs, as well as higher fees at 
golf courses and the city zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members expressed optimism Wednesday that departments could absorb 
the 6% reduction in their salary requests -- 2% more than Bradley proposed -- 
without serious disruption. 
</P>
<P>
Under the council proposal, three large agencies that supply critical services 
-- police, fire and sanitation -- were held to only a 1% cut in salary 
accounts. Thus far, money remains in the budget for 400 new police officers and 
115 new paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the Finance and Revenue Committee, said 
the actions constituted a "balanced diet" for city government "that will 
prevent us from having to go on a starvation liquid protein diet" next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're spending beyond our means and that has to come to a stop," Yaroslavsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His comments were echoed by other council members, most of whom agreed with the 
grim financial assessment and budget-cutting proposals drawn up in recent weeks 
by the budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who voted against the across-the-board cuts in 
salary requests, charged that the budget-cutting talk was "malarkey." He said 
that even with the council actions, most departments are "still receiving 
substantial increases." 
</P>
<P>
The tax increases, which will go back to the council for final approval, would 
raise an estimated $59.3 million in new revenue. The parking tax would add a 
10% fee to the cost of most parking in the city and generate $22.5 million in 
new revenue. In addition, the city business tax on gross receipts would 
increase 10%, and a special levy to pay for trash trucks would double from 
$1.50 per month per household to $3. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increases were approved on lopsided votes on the first full day of 
detailed council hearings on the mayor's budget, which despite the warnings of 
fiscal problems is up $417.2 million, or 13%. Further wrangling over additional 
cuts -- and funding for various officials' pet projects -- is expected to 
continue at least through the week before a final budget is approved. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing Wednesday morning, reaction to the new and increased 
taxes was largely negative. 
</P>
<P>
Gill Barnett, president of a firm that operates garages around the city, said 
people are "confused and upset" about the proposed 10% parking tax and that the 
city has made little effort to explain the tax to the public. He said he 
believes that the mayor and the council are moving too quickly on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public would be outraged if they knew this tax is going to go into 
place," Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members said they hoped questions about the fairness of the 
parking tax would be addressed before the final ordinance is approved. The tax 
is based on the amount paid by the motorist. 
</P>
<P>
Critics point out that many downtown city employees, executives and 
professionals have parking that is subsidized by their employers -- and their 
tax would be far less than, say, workers who must pay the full cost of their 
own parking. 
</P>
<P>
"It falls disproportionately heavy on (some) workers," said Councilman Robert 
Farrell, who voted against the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials acknowledged that there may be inequities, but said the 
benefits of raising revenues and encouraging use of public transit and 
car-pooling were the paramount considerations. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the council voted to use $250,000 in federal poverty funds to 
pay for an expanded AIDS education program. The money includes $50,000 for 
distribution of needle-cleaning kits and condoms to intravenous drug users, who 
are at high risk of contracting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS funds were not part of Bradley's original budget proposal, but the 
mayor later forwarded a departmental request to the council along with his 
endorsement of the request.

ECHO PARK YARD AN EYESORE TO SOME, TRENDY ART TO OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Is it artful? Or awful? 
</P>
<P>
Residents of an Echo Park hilltop who have been fighting for months over what 
to call Gary Leonard's front yard may have to go to court for the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard has turned a collection of discarded bicycles, toasters, rusty 
bedsprings, garden tools, machine gears, car parts and scrap metal into 
freewheeling forms that have all but swallowed up his hillside home near the 
north end of the 2400 block of Echo Park Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Art, say Leonard and his supporters, who insist that he has created the kind of 
whimsical sculpture that would sell for big bucks in trendy Los Angeles 
galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Trash, answer most of his neighbors, who assert that the growing pile of junk 
has become an eyesore lowering the area's property values and endangering 
children and motorists on the narrow, meandering street. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials, who have been gingerly investigating the dispute 
since last fall, say it's a touchy issue they wish had never been dumped in 
their laps. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's really willing to determine whether it's art or junk," said Sylvia 
Novoa, a deputy to City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who has tried to referee 
the fight. "I'm not an art critic. I don't know if it's art." 
</P>
<P>
City Building and Safety Department administrators have failed to persuade 
Leonard to voluntarily remove the sculpture. Department officials contend that 
the city building code prohibits such accumulations in residential yards. 
</P>
<P>
Department investigator Tim O'Conner chose his words carefully as he described 
Leonard's collection first as "junk" and then as "debris." 
</P>
<P>
"I should say the 'material' is in violation," O'Conner finally said. 
</P>
<P>
But officials have given Leonard the benefit of the doubt. They delayed seeking 
a court order to force Leonard to clean his yard so he would have time to 
petition the city's Cultural Heritage Commission to designate his sculpture a 
cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners rejected his application last month. Although Leonard has the 
right to re-apply, he hasn't yet. So Building and Safety officials have decided 
to ask the city attorney's office on Friday to file criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas K. Nagano, who helped prepare Leonard's first cultural landmark 
application, said it was rejected because the yard was still "a work in 
progress." Nagano, a business agent for Los Angeles artists, said a new 
application will be submitted when Leonard finishes his creation this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The yard sculpture, he said, "is changing the contextual feeling of Echo Park 
-- and I think changing it for the better." 
</P>
<P>
"It is garbage, but it is art," he said. "It is definitely sculpture. His whole 
yard is a statement. He understands where Los Angeles is going." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard is digging in his heels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to go the distance," said the 39-year-old Encino-born 
photographer, who moved to Echo Park 10 years ago. "I'm proud of my work. You 
can see the fun if you look at the different textures and colors." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said he started creating sculpture from wired-together castoffs about 
five years ago as therapy after a bitter divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"Working at this has kept me sane. Isn't it funny that it makes me look crazy?" 
he said. "I'd been working on it some time when about two years ago I crossed a 
line. One day, nobody noticed it. Then the next day, everybody did." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors first complained informally to Molina about the front yard in 
mid-1988. According to the councilwoman, an investigation indicated that 
Leonard's work did not create a hazard. When the collection continued to grow, 
26 irate neighbors filed a protest petition last fall demanding action by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"This can't be art. This is overkill," said Andy Aybar, an actor who lives next 
door to Leonard. "He's decimated what once was a lovely property. I don't see 
him as a persecuted artist, and I try to be real liberal and open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Stephanie Brooks lives across the street and up the hill from 
Leonard. She looks down on his work in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself as having very liberal views on art," she said. "I don't 
consider what he's doing art." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the neighborhood, traditionally one of Los Angeles' most eclectic, 
have more mixed views. A man traveling past Leonard's house in a station wagon 
shook his head and waggled his forefinger in a circle to silently signal his 
opinion that both the sculpture and the sculptor were wacko. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Wall stopped to consider the piles of discards as he walked toward his 
home two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"It does look like a lot of junk," Wall said. "But I'm surprised there's a lot 
of complaining. It's not as though there's a lot of order to the architecture 
up here. Maybe it would bother me if I lived closer." 
</P>
<P>
From his perspective -- standing beneath the hood of a 1951 Chevrolet that 
serves as the front porch to his 87-year-old house -- Leonard said his work has 
been a positive influence on Echo Park. He urged a visitor with a camera to 
photograph the faintly anthropomorphic figures, not him. 
</P>
<P>
"This has gotten me close to my neighbors," he said. "I never used to talk to 
them before. Now I do. It's like 'Ozzie and Harriet.' " 
</P>
<P>
The city shouldn't be preparing to serve him with a subpoena, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, "I should be getting a plaque."

USE OF SOFTBALL RINGERS BECOMES A FEDERAL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One is a courthouse marshal in Van Nuys, a shortstop so good some say he could 
have made the pros. Another washes cars for a living and a third works for a 
utility company. Still another is a machinist in Sun Valley, a coveted slugger 
who plays as a "ringer" in softball tournaments all over the western United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"I live and die softball," said machinist Manny Maldonado, 34, who hit 75 
homers last year and claims a .660 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
What these four men have in common is a Pacoima-based softball team called the 
Wongs, whose members are supposed to work for the U.S. Postal Service's Van 
Nuys division. 
</P>
<P>
But if claims under investigation by postal inspectors prove true, the Wongs 
are not right. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion is not a corked bat or a doctored softball, but doctored IDs. 
Postal inspectors are investigating allegations that some Wongs were issued 
phony Postal Service identification cards to be eligible for a variety of post 
office tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Although outsiders, or "ringers," are not uncommon in the highly competitive 
world of amateur softball, how many fake ID cards were allegedly issued in this 
case, who dispensed them, and how often they were used is unclear and a matter 
of investigation, said Postal Inspector Donald Obritsch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically forging a government document, and that would be a felony," 
Obritsch said. "We take these types of allegations very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
If the allegations prove true, Obritsch said, the culprits could be looking at 
five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. But such hardball, Obritsch said, is 
usually reserved for people who want to steal more than trophies. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say who was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Softball purists may be troubled by such allegations of impropriety, but hardly 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, it's not anything unusual," said Douglas Noverr, a sports 
historian and professor of American studies at Michigan State University. "I 
guess it's the win-at-all cost syndrome that's part of American sports." 
</P>
<P>
Regulations on using ringers, outsiders recruited for their superior athletic 
abilities to shore up amateur teams, vary among different leagues and 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
While some leagues forbid anyone other than employees from joining company 
teams, others allow a small number of outsiders to enhance the team's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, they said they were allowed two ringers without ID," said 
Maldonado, who claimed that he hasn't played for the Wongs since the mid-1980s 
and that he never used a bogus ID. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it is unusual for such transgressions to attract the attention of 
the feds. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of anyone going to that extent," Noverr said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wongs take softball seriously. Besides its victories, the team is known for 
its distinctive red jackets, and for the vanity key chains, visors and even 
toothbrushes emblazoned with its name. 
</P>
<P>
One ringer contacted by The Times acknowledged that he received a government 
driver's permit about two years ago so he could play for the Wongs in a 
tournament for post office employees in Las Vegas. He said he used the ID only 
once, and hasn't played for the Wongs since. 
</P>
<P>
"I do have an ID and I did play on the team," said the man, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The signature of the official issuing the man's ID card, a copy of which was 
obtained by The Times, does not belong to an employee of the Postal Service's 
Van Nuys division, a spokesman confirmed. The signature on the card, issued in 
1988 and good through 1992, appears to be "John Smith" and such an employee 
does not exist there, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Other ringers contacted also acknowledged playing for the Wongs in post office 
games in the past years, but they, like Maldonado, denied ever using fake IDs. 
</P>
<P>
The softball scandal surfaced in a harassment claim by Jill Helms, a 
35-year-old letter carrier, who happens to manage a Burbank-based softball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said she believes her problems began after a casual conversation with her 
boss, a member of the Wongs, about that team's winning record in a post office 
tournament in Oxnard. Knowing how hard it is to recruit good players, Helms 
said she innocently asked her boss whether his team was composed entirely of 
post office employees. Helms said she found it odd when the supervisor replied, 
"They all work for the post office and they all have their IDs." 
</P>
<P>
It was after that incident that she began to be harassed by her supervisor over 
attendance problems, Helms said, and she took a stress leave in October. She 
learned of the Wongs' alleged use of ringers from others while discussing her 
work problems with softball colleagues, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said she believes she was penalized for her discovery, which she reported 
to postal inspectors after she went on leave. "It's because of the way he came 
down on me in the three months after we had that conversation" about softball, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Helms' former supervisor, Charles Evans, said he plays for the 
Wongs but denied any involvement with ringers or forging government 
identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, all the Wongs are postal employees," said Evans, now a 
supervisor in the Newhall post office. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who said Helms' attendance problems are well-documented, called the 
allegations "abusive and unfair to the guys who do play on the softball team." 
</P>
<P>
He repeated: "We are all postal employees."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 10% TAX ON FAIRGROUND ADMISSIONS RESCINDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After protests from more than 200 employees, concessionaires and promoters of 
events at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, the Pomona City Council has 
rescinded a 10% admissions tax enacted a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The council instead instructed City Administrator Julio Fuentes to work with 
Ralph Hinds, president of the Los Angeles County Fair Assn., to seek other 
sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds said the tax, which would have applied to admissions and fees for exhibit 
space at all events at the fairgrounds except the county fair and off-track 
betting, would have had a devastating effect on fairground operations, and 
could have cost hundreds of jobs.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS URGED BY TASK 
FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dividing the Los Angeles Unified School District into at least eight and as 
many as 49 smaller districts will improve academic performance and reduce the 
number of dropouts, according to a report issued Wednesday by a task force 
formed to study ways to break up the district. 
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the 610,000-student district is "incapable of addressing 
the legitimate education needs of Los Angeles-area students," said 
Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge), a longtime advocate of 
breaking up the district who formed the task force. 
</P>
<P>
But two of the seven members appointed to serve on the Los Angeles Task Force 
for Better Education said that despite the report's conclusions, they have not 
seen enough evidence that dividing up the district would cure the many ills 
plaguing city schools.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLESS ADMITS LIVING AT HOUSE THAT WAS 
INVADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Sharon Gless, co-star of the "Cagney and Lacey" TV series, testified 
Wednesday that she lied when she told reporters she did not live at the Studio 
City house that an obsessed fan allegedly invaded with a .22-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying at a preliminary hearing for Joni Leigh Penn, Gless said she was 
worried that disclosure of her address would lead to "copycat" incidents by 
other fans. 
</P>
<P>
Gless, through her publicist, had earlier told reporters that the house was 
used primarily as an office and that she lived elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of whether Gless lived at the house is important because Penn cannot 
be found guilty of residential burglary if the dwelling was not Gless' primary 
residence, said Penn's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mitchell Bruckner. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, 30, of Garden Grove was charged with two counts of residential burglary 
after police said she barricaded herself in the Studio City house March 30. 
Police persuaded Penn to give herself up after a seven-hour standoff.

SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to complaints about traffic, loitering and public urination, Cal State 
Dominguez Hills has decided not to invite the Grateful Dead rock band back to 
the campus. The band, which has a devoted following harking back to its roots 
in the counterculture of the 1960s, performed over the weekend at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"The concert on the campus was peaceful . . . (but) in the interest of good 
relations with the Carson community, we have decided not to invite the Grateful 
Dead back to our campus," university spokesman Richard Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably best," said Carson Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt, "because our 
neighborhoods are up in arms about it." 
</P>
<P>
Also, a 19-year-old woman allegedly took LSD outside the concert Saturday, ran 
a red light in Manhattan Beach and broadsided another car, killing a pregnant 
woman and her fetus. Heather Tolles was charged Tuesday with two counts of 
second-degree murder.

GALA DRAWS ATTENTION TO LUPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lupus sufferers got some much-needed recognition Tuesday night as the Lupus 
Foundation of America honored Richard and Jeramie Dreyfuss with the first-ever 
Summa award at the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
The black-tie gala honored the two for their work in raising awareness of the 
disease and campaigning for research funding. Jeramie, who suffers from lupus, 
husband Richard and daughter Emily, 6, were the focal point of a reception 
preceding the dinner. Nancy Horn, president of the Lupus Foundation of America 
and gala co-chairwoman, and gala chairwoman Glenda Kay Amon were on hand, as 
were Paul Michael and Elizabeth Glaser, Michele Lee and Fred Rappaport, Theresa 
Russell, Richard Donner and Lauren Shuler-Donner, John Lithgow and Alan Ladd 
Jr. Amy Irving, who planned to appear, sent regrets; the actress had had a baby 
just days before. Among the hundreds of other guests were several doctors 
involved in lupus treatment and research, and many lupus patients. 
</P>
<P>
Lupus, an auto-immune disease that has varying symptoms and can be 
life-threatening, affects mostly women and can take years to diagnose. While it 
affects hundreds of thousands of people, there is little public knowledge of 
the disease -- something the Dreyfusses have tried to change. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting the award, Richard Dreyfuss made an impassioned plea for social 
responsibility and heaped praise upon his wife, saying: "I am a busy guy, but 
I'm not as busy as Jeramie. I am a pretty good and decent guy, but not as good 
and decent as Jeramie. But I am a better whiner. I don't live in pain as easily 
as she does. I think we need more Jeramie Dreyfusses both in and out of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
As she wiped away tears, Jeramie added, "I've heard such incredible stories 
tonight, it reminds me why I'm here. My goal is to spread the word about this 
silent killer." 
</P>
<P>
Little Richard got the audience literally on its feet as he played a rousing 
set, culminating with duet with Elton John. The event, underwritten by two 
anonymous donors, raised more than $500,000.

MEDIA GUSH OVER JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever Michael Jackson is honored, it's news. Heck, whenever he leaves the 
house, it's news. And the promise of seeing the entertainer collect yet another 
award was enough to get almost every photographer and camera crew in Hollywood 
to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Tuesdayafternoon, when Jackson was honored at a 
lunch thrown by the music publishing organization BMI. 
</P>
<P>
The new BMI Michael Jackson Award, based on his humanitarian as well as show 
business efforts, was presented by BMI president/CEO Frances Preston at a 
pre-lunch press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling talkative, the soft-spoken, sunglasses-wearing Jackson commented: 
"Thank you very much Frances," before being escorted from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
(The normally bold press corps was respectfully quiet during his exit. 
Apparently you can scream questions at the President, but not at Michael 
Jackson.) 
</P>
<P>
Then it was downstairs for lunch and conversation with guests like Elton John, 
who sympathized with Jackson: "A lot of rubbish has been written about him, as 
it has about all of us. Including me." 
</P>
<P>
Also there: the star's parents, Joe and Katherine, and brother Jackie, as well 
as Brian Wilson, Gladys Knight, Petula Clark, Milton Berle, MC Hammer, Vanessa 
Williams, Melissa Manchester, Micky Dolenz of the Monkees, Berry Gordy, Juliet 
Mills and Maxwell Caulfield, Stephen Bishop, Jelly Bean Benitez, Allee Willis 
and Barbara Orbison. The inimitable Little Richard made one of his 
not-so-little entrances midway through the program. And Michael, apparently 
more at ease, removed his sunglasses during the meal. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch was basically an extended photo opportunity interrupted by salmon and 
Caesar salad, but it all became worthwhile over coffee, when BMI showed a 
compilation tape of the star's career, put together by Jackson himself. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-minute documentary chronicled his life from the Jackson 5 through his 
zillion-selling solo albums, with lots of shots of hyperventilating teen-age 
girls and congratulations from Elizabeth Taylor and Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
And who might be the second recipient of the Michael Jackson Award? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I haven't even begun to think about that," said BMI president Preston. 
</P>
<P>
Well, here's an idea. How about sister Janet?

SUNKEN SHIPS BECOME TV STARS

Live, from the bottom of Lake Ontario, it's . . . Jason and the sunken 
19th-Century schooners. 
</P>
<P>
It's not MTV or even a cartoon, but this "Jason" show has had tens of thousands 
of select schoolchildren glued to the tube for more than a week and their 
teachers don't seem to mind a bit. 
</P>
<P>
In a fascinating marriage of archeology, history and high-tech razzmatazz, 
elementary and junior high school students gather daily at 14 different 
locations around Canada and the United States to take part in a live, two-way 
satellite television hookup with an underwater exploration team both above and 
deep beneath Lake Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
With the aid of "Jason Jr.," a cousin of the state-of-the-art deep-sea probe 
that found the sunken remains of the Titanic in 1985, youngsters watch as the 
well-preserved hulks of two warships that capsized in a storm during the War of 
1812 are archeologically mapped. 
</P>
<P>
The ships -- the Hamilton and the Scourge -- have been lying undisturbed under 
300 feet of water for more than 176 years. The location of the Navy vessels, 
the children are told, will remain a mystery for fear of vandalism. What they 
do know is that the live broadcast comes from a barge about six miles off St. 
Catherines, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Their host is marine geologist Robert Ballard, who designed the concept to 
inspire interest in the kinds of technical disciplines that all too many of 
today's American youngsters seem to disdain. 
</P>
<P>
"Most kids have closed the door to science by the 10th grade," said Ballard 
from his vessel/stage. "We're just trying to keep the door open." 
</P>
<P>
One day last week, youngsters sat captivated as the screens filled with 
computer generated three-dimensional images of the wrecks. Then they shared in 
the excitement of Ballard and his crew as everyone -- both those on the ship 
and the students in the museums -- got a simultaneous first glimpse of a fully 
intact cannon. 
</P>
<P>
Another big moment came when 10-year-old Lacolis Robertson in Memphis 
maneuvered Jason via a remote control joy stick. "I liked it when he drove 
Jason," said Tyler Thomas, 10, later as he walked out of the auditorium with 
the rest of his class. 
</P>
<P>
The idea to involve kids in the archeological mapping project came to Ballard 
after he received "tens of thousands" of letters about the Titanic from 
children. Ballard and the JASON Foundation for Education, a partnership between 
industry, research facilities, museums and educational organizations, decided 
to exploit the wrecks to get students excited about science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Math is like wind sprints," said Ballard, a former UC Santa Barbara basketball 
player. "You've got to sell them on the game and they'll do the wind sprints. 
They'll do the mental push-ups." 
</P>
<P>
The program began April 30 and will run through Saturday . In Chicago alone, 
more than 14,000 youngsters from schools in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, 
Michigan and as far away as Missouri will travel to the city's Museum of 
Science and Industry to take part. Thousands more from Boston and Dallas to 
Victoria, British Columbia (but none in California), are also linked by 
satellite to Ballard's barge. They can see the wrecks up close, listen to 
Ballard explain what's going on and ask questions of him and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
Before attending these 90-minute sessions with Ballard, the youngsters work 
with an extensive curriculum -- prepared by the National Science Teachers 
Foundation -- that includes building milk carton boats only to drown them in a 
windstorm. They also bake hardtack, an unleavened bread once a staple of a 
sailor's rations. Through the hands-on activities, they gain knowledge of math 
and the various sciences and history required for an archeological exploration 
such as this one. 
</P>
<P>
"When you read something, you remember 10%. When you hear something, you 
remember 15%. But when you do something, you remember 80%," said Ballard. "And 
that's the key to learning, get them out of the classroom and get their hands 
on." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second year Ballard has invited children to partake in his 
adventures. Last year through "telepresence," as he calls it, thousands of 
students visited the Mediterranean Sea to explore the Star Hercules, the 
deepest known ancient shipwreck. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, if funds hold out, he plans to take the show to the Galapagos 
Islands in the Pacific Ocean off South America. But getting supporters in 
additional cities as excited as the kids has not been easy. Ballard is working 
on getting next year's program directly into St. Louis schoolrooms but he says 
he can't find a place for it in Los Angeles. "We have tried so hard," but the 
minimal $2.50 cost per child shut all doors," said Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
The excited students described the experience as "neat" and "cool" as one of 
the presentations ended. But, they also left seeing how pollution and turbidity 
make the live underwater shots murky. And, because Ballard repeatedly stresses 
the importance of geometry, physics and biology, they seemed less certain that 
these classes are boring and useless. 
</P>
<P>
"I like oceans and science," said Chad Osmer, 9, who came with his fourth-grade 
class and plans to return to the museum with his mother. He wants to see more 
of what Ballard does. Although he's still not sure what physics is, he is not 
deterred. Osmer has added the morning's activities to his list of possible 
careers, which he says is composed of "this and baseball."

FIRST PERSON: DISRUPTION COMES ON LITTLE CAT FEET

<P>
Last week I found out for sure that I am allergic to cats. 
</P>
<P>
I am so allergic to cat dander that the scratch test had to be diluted by a 
factor of 25 just so they could read the reaction. 
</P>
<P>
My wife, whom I will call Obedienta, and I own a black long hair cat named Hana 
No-Neiko No Sawyer-san, Hana for short. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Hana is Obedienta's cat. Before Hana, Obedienta had Travis, who got 
eaten by our neighbor's dog. Before Travis, she owned Murray. I've lived with a 
cat for eight years, which is as long as I've lived with my wife. I love my 
wife, but I do not, nor have I ever, loved a cat. 
</P>
<P>
The reason I went to check for allergies is that I have had the same nagging 
flu symptoms that most of California seems to have been suffering this year. 
But, unlike the rest of Los Angeles, I nearly died last summer of spinal 
meningitis, which started with an earache. 
</P>
<P>
My sore throat not only wasn't going away, it was starting to give me an 
earache and my doctor was getting nervous. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested allergy testing. 
</P>
<P>
When the nurse put the little micro-drop of dander in there, my arm turned into 
a water balloon. There was no question: I was acutely allergic to cats. 
</P>
<P>
So, it was a fairly straightforward problem, I thought. I would go home and 
tell Obedienta we have to send Hana to her mother or sister, both of whom love 
cats and have several already. Hana is threatening my health. Ergo, Hana has to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Some background: Obedienta is the mother of our two children, aged 1 and 2. She 
is also a licensed architect who has put her professional career on hold 
because we believe that we should raise our kids ourselves, even if it meant 
taking a financial bath for a time. I work full time downtown and have 
published a few novels in the past couple of years that help with the income, 
but we are running at a net loss of nearly $1,000 per month. 
</P>
<P>
So Obedienta and I had started out "equal." I worked and she worked. I was 
willing to be the one to stay home full time while she continued working. I 
would fit in novels during nap time. 
</P>
<P>
But I had a hard time with breast-feeding and in a short while we were trodding 
the traditional path: Obedienta as the mom and I as the dad who goes off to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking it's no big deal, I stroll in with my news about Hana. After all, I'm 
not saying we take her to the pound. She'll have a good home, friends, perhaps 
a more interesting social environment, an upscale diet. 
</P>
<P>
Obedienta wouldn't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
I went through the roof. After my working full time for three years, supporting 
her and the kids, the stress of two jobs when my health is threatened, how can 
she refuse -- how can she even think to refuse -- to give up her damn cat? 
</P>
<P>
When the plaster settled, it turned out that Hana wasn't the issue. My 
suggestion that Hana had to go became for Obedienta the symbol of everything 
she had compromised to be a mom, every way she had changed. Hana was all she 
could claim as her own -- not hers and mine together, not the family's. 
</P>
<P>
Hana was the urban house, published projects, financial success, lost parties, 
womantalks, everything that our decision had robbed from her. 
</P>
<P>
But then your husband tells you we've got to ace the cat. 
</P>
<P>
He's allergic and you love him. You love your kids, too, but whatever happened 
to having your own life? When does it come back? What should you do? 
</P>
<P>
And on my side, how much of my working life is my own? Didn't I, too, give up a 
lot to have a family? I love my wife. How can I ask her to ace Hana? 
</P>
<P>
Why, way back in the early days, didn't we decide to have a turtle?

PLANS FOR RAYMOND THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city may join efforts to preserve and renovate the 69-year-old Raymond 
Theatre under an agreement to be devised between the city and theater owners 
Gene Buchanan and Mark Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
City directors on Tuesday voted to allow city staff members to begin 
negotiations that would keep the 1,800-seat former vaudeville house on Raymond 
Avenue in Old Pasadena alive as a concert and performance hall. 
</P>
<P>
Three concert and theater operators have indicated interest in buying the 
theater but said Buchanan and Perkins' asking price of $2.8 million has been 
too high. 
</P>
<P>
The owners had planned to convert the Raymond to offices but put those plans on 
hold when the city hired R. F. McCann &amp; Co. Theatre Architects in 1988 to 
determine the feasibility of preserving the Raymond. The McCann study concluded 
that a theater could be profitable but suggested city participation. 
</P>
<P>
That participation could involve the city's giving Buchanan and Perkins 
development rights to a nearby bank parking lot in exchange for their accepting 
a lower price on the theater property, said Marsha Rood, city development 
operations administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city does not own the lot, it owns development "air rights" over 
it, Rood said.

ONE COLORADO FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Stitzel, developer of the One Colorado project, received permission 
Tuesday from the Board of Directors to ask project investors to cash in $9.9 
million in bonds issued by the city to finance an 850-space parking garage 
across the street from his $70-million retail development. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel would redeem the investors' bonds, thus ending the city's connection to 
the garage financing. 
</P>
<P>
The garage, part of the One Colorado project, is being refinanced now that 
Stitzel has obtained a construction loan of more than $67 million from Yasuda 
Trust &amp; Banking Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Toshoku, a Japanese trading 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel has said he wanted to refinance the garage to eliminate restrictions on 
building modifications imposed by the city as part of its financing conditions.

FAIRGROUNDS TAX RESCINDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After protests from more than 200 employees, concessionaires and promoters of 
events at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, the City Council this week 
rescinded a 10% admissions tax enacted a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The council, by a 4-1 vote Monday, repealed the tax and instructed City 
Administrator Julio Fuentes to work with Ralph Hinds, president of the Los 
Angeles County Fair Assn., to seek other sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds said the tax, which would have applied to admissions and charges for 
exhibit space at all events at the fairgrounds except for the county fair and 
off-track betting, would have had a devastating effect on fairground 
operations, and could have cost hundreds of jobs. He said promoters of trade 
shows and other events would have sought other locations rather than pay the 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, who proposed the tax a week ago without 
consulting fair officials, complained that the city gets little revenue but 
lots of traffic jams and other problems from events at the fairgrounds, now 
known as Fairplex, the Los Angeles County Fair and Exposition Complex. "There 
is no reason except greed for Fairplex to oppose this tax," said Bryant, who 
cast the only dissenting vote on the repeal measure. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua, who had voted for the tax a week 
ago, said they reversed their votes when they learned that fair officials 
objected. Soto said the city desperately needs more revenue, but said the city 
staff should work with fair officials to find another approach.

A public hearing to discuss whether the region's water shortage has affected 
Pasadena will be held at 3 p.m. May 22 at City Hall. 
</P>

PARKING PERMIT PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved plans to establish a nighttime permit parking zone 
for residents of the Larrabee Street-Palm Avenue area. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and guests with permits will be allowed to park along San Vicente 
Boulevard, Palm Avenue and Harratt and Larrabee streets from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. 
according to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Vehicles parked along Cynthia Street and San Vicente must also display permits 
from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. Those without permits may park for a maximum of two hours 
between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the council voted 3 to 2 to increase permit parking fees by 
67% to offset rising administrative costs of the city's preferential parking 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Resident parking fees, which would increase permit revenues by $70,000, will 
cost $5 for the first permit, $8 for the second, $14 for the third and $24 for 
the fourth.

PERGOLA PLANS TO BE ALTERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday decided to alter its plans for rebuilding the 
pergola outside City Hall after discovering that three construction companies 
bidding for the work could not complete the job for the $62,500 estimate given 
by the city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with bids ranging from $66,950 to $104,799, the council decided to 
redesign the project and find new funding sources. The city may use Community 
Redevelopment Agency money to rebuild part of the pergola nearest the City Hall 
entrance and devise other methods to pay for the structure's dome. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old, wisteria-draped pergola, or arbor, was torn down last year 
after the wooden crossbeams were discovered to have been weakened by dampness 
from the vines.

LANDMARK STATUS AWARDED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendora City Council, exercising for the first time its power under the 
city's Historic Preservation Ordinance, has designated two buildings and a tree 
as landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
The action prohibits exterior changes to the buildings or cutting of the tree 
without permission from the city's Historic Preservation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting Tuesday, Planning and Redevelopment Director Stan Wong 
said the Mission Revival-style Sutherland wing of the Historical Society 
building, at 314 N. Glendora Ave., was chosen for preservation because was 
Glendora's City Hall until 1921, when the present City Hall was built. 
</P>
<P>
The present City Hall, the second building protected, is a mix of Classical 
Revival and Italian Renaissance styles. It is located at 116 E. Foothill Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
An Australian Moreton Bay fig tree at the corner of Colorado and Santa Fe 
avenues was also granted landmark status. Wong said the tree is one of the 
largest of its variety in California, second only to a tree in Santa Barbara. 
According to the plaque next to the fig tree, it is 90 feet high with a trunk 
that is 30 feet in circumference.

TWO HEALTH-CARE PLANS FOR DIAMOND BAR; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: ONE HOSPITAL PROPOSAL FELL APART SEVERAL YEARS AGO. NOW TWO FIRMS 
WANT TO REMEDY THAT -- BY BUILDING MEDICAL FACILITIES ON ADJACENT LOTS. 
</P>

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several years after plans to build a hospital here fell through, two medical 
corporations are drawing up separate proposals to build health facilities on 
adjacent lots in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Inter-Community Health Services Inc., which owns Inter-Community Medical Center 
in Covina, has purchased 26 acres of land on Grand Avenue near the Pomona (60) 
Freeway for the purpose of developing a medical center that will offer services 
that have not yet been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nova International Care Enterprises Inc., an Orange County-based 
company that develops and manages hospitals, is proposing a 96-bed, $25-million 
to $35-million hospital on an adjacent lot currently owned by Downey Savings 
&amp; Loan. The company is trying to find physician investors to finance the 
land purchase and construction. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies say Diamond Bar is an ideal location because it is easily 
accessible from the freeways and lacks a hospital within a five-mile radius. 
There are 10 hospitals within nine miles of the site. 
</P>
<P>
So far, neither company has submitted formal plans to City Hall, and until 
Monday, neither was aware of the other's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised, I was surprised as hell," Venkatappa Kumaraswamy, Nova's 
president and chief executive officer, said on learning that Inter-Community 
wants to build a health facility next to his proposed hospital site. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar City Manager Robert Van Nort, who met with Kumaraswamy and Mayor 
Gary Werner to discuss the project, emphasized that the plans are preliminary. 
Until a conditional-use permit is applied for, "they're strictly researching 
the matter," he said. "But because a hospital is a high priority to the city, 
we will take every step to move it as fast as we can through the system." 
</P>
<P>
Van Nort said he has not met with nor heard from Inter-Community officials. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time Diamond Bar has been considered for a hospital. In 
1985, a subsidiary of Dallas-based American Healthcare Management Inc. bought 
the land now owned by Inter-Community and obtained state approval for a 71-bed, 
acute-care hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But the plans collapsed in 1986 when American Healthcare Management faced 
financial problems. One year later, it filed for protection from creditors 
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, said Forrest Cebold, assistant 
treasurer for American Healthcare. A group of doctors tried to buy the property 
in 1987 but couldn't raise the money, Kumaraswamy said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 64.2% of available hospital beds in the state were filled, down from 
68.5% in 1982, according to the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health 
Systems. But occupancy is picking up slowly as the population increases and 
fewer hospitals are built, said Lori Aldrete, a spokeswoman for the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
An Inter-Community telephone survey of 400 Walnut and Diamond Bar residents 
backs the company's contention that additional health services are needed, said 
Deborah Nicklas, Inter-Community's vice president of planning and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the area has a low doctor-to-population ratio, Nicklas said. 
Statewide, there are three doctors for every 1,000 people, compared to slightly 
more than one doctor per 1,000 residents in Diamond Bar and Walnut, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Inter-Community officials will hire a consulting firm and organize a citizens' 
group to determine the health-care needs of the area before they come up with 
specific plans. Nicklas said the project will probably include emergency and 
outpatient facilities, and may share resources, physicians and staff with the 
280-bed Inter-Community Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Kumaraswamy's company is building a 250-bed hospital in Hesperia, and recently 
entered into a joint venture to purchase and manage the 203-bed Healthcare 
Medical Center in Tustin. He said local doctors, many of whom were involved in 
the 1987 hospital plan, have expressed interest in financing his Diamond Bar 
hospital project, which would be a private, for-profit facility.

<P>
Two San Gabriel Valley students are among 141 high school seniors nationwide 
selected as 1990 presidential scholars. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos announced the names of 
the students last week. 
</P>
<P>
Local scholars are Jennifer S. Frautschi of John Muir High School in Pasadena 
and David S. Parks of Arcadia High School. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 141 scholars, 121 were selected on the basis of academic scholarship, 
leadership, character and commitment to high ideals. They include a man and 
woman from each state; Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico, and American students 
living abroad, as well as 15 students selected at large. Parks is among this 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The other 20 were selected based on achievements in the creative or performing 
arts. Frautschi is an arts scholar. 
</P>
<P>
The students -- receiving the highest federal honor bestowed upon a graduating 
high school senior -- will visit Washington from June 16-20, attend a White 
House ceremony and receive $1,000 each from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, 
a private philanthropic organization in Morristown, N.J.

SCHOOL NEWS: TWINS RAISE FUNDS FOR 'AMBASSADORIAL' TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joann and Talolo Lepale, 16-year-old twins selected to tour Europe and Moscow 
as part of the People to People High School Ambassador Program, have raised the 
$8,000 needed for their summer trip, just making their May 10 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The twins have spent the last four months raising money for the 31-day trip, 
said their mother, Yonneta Lepale. 
</P>
<P>
They collected cans and newspapers, held a carwash and a yard sale. They also 
sent out 110 letters to clubs and organizations in the San Gabriel Valley 
asking for donations. 
</P>
<P>
Pledges came in from neighbors, local doctors, pharmacists, shop owners, and 
their friends and co-workers. The largest donation came from the American 
Legion. 
</P>
<P>
The Lepale twins, juniors at Bassett High School, were selected on the basis of 
their academic achievement, community involvement and recommendations from 
teachers and counselors. The People to People program is a nonprofit 
organization founded during the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration to 
encourage international student exchange.

Southern California, owner of the structures at 3725 Don Felipe Drive, to move 
forward with plans to build a 52-unit condominium project but requires that the 
original adobes remain undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is about time that communities like Baldwin Hills had their historic 
monuments recognized just like other communities, like Hollywood," said 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes Baldwin Hills. "There is 
history in every community, and these are some of the oldest buildings in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
The adobes, with thick walls and high, redwood-beamed ceilings, were once the 
center of the 4,000-acre rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera owned by Vicente 
Sanchez, alcalde -- or mayor -- of Los Angeles in 1830. In the 1920s, an 
addition was built linking the structures and the building was converted into a 
larger clubhouse by the Sunset Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated bought the building in 1972 and maintains its headquarters there. 
About two years ago, Consolidated came up with the condominium plans that 
called for the demolition of the 11,000-square-foot building that houses the 
firm's offices, a large auditorium, two other large halls for meetings and a 
fully equipped kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans were placed in limbo when the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage 
Commission recommended that the entire building be given historic-monument 
status. The City Council's arts, health and humanities committee proposed a 
compromise that would make only the original adobe structures historic, and the 
council agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated accepted the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out OK," said Reginald Ballard, a Consolidated spokesman. "We plan 
to build a condominium on the property and incorporate the historical 
significance of the site into the design and planning." 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated plans to build its condominium around the two adobes on the 
1.3-acre parcel, an area known for its Indian artifacts dating to prehistoric 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"Its location on a hill provides a great vantage point to view the rest of the 
basin," said Alma Carlisle, a specialist with the city's bureau of engineering. 
The first written evidence of a structure on the site appears in maps of Rancho 
La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera dating from the early 1850s, she said. 
</P>
<P>
La Cienega means "the marsh" and La Tijera refers to the narrow scissor-shaped 
valleys between the hills. 
</P>
<P>
According to the late Virginia French, who wrote a book on the old adobes, Gov. 
Manuel Micheltorena granted the property to Vicente Sanchez in 1843 for his 
"valiant soldiering and good citizenry." At the time, the rancho extended from 
what is now Exposition Boulevard to Slauson and from La Cienega east to about 
4th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
When Vicente died, the property was taken over by the Sanchez heirs. The 
Sanchez descendants remained prominent in the early history of Los Angeles. 
Vicente Sanchez's son, Tomas, was elected sheriff of Los Angeles County seven 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the ownership of the Sanchez Ranch was turned over to E. J. (Lucky) 
Baldwin, after whom Baldwin Hills was named. Baldwin divided much of the 
acreage and sold most of it for development. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement to preserve the structures, Galanter promised to 
assist the owners in obtaining the permits needed to complete their project. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard said his group's project will not only provide jobs but result in 
housing that the community will be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to build something that our children and their children can be proud 
of," he said, "Those buildings may be 150 years old, but 150 years from now we 
want someone to look up at this hill and see what my heritage has done."

STATE OFFICIALS VOW TO REDRAFT PROPOSAL TO BAN COMMERCIAL FISHING OF CROAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stung by an adverse ruling by the state office of administrative law, state 
fish and game officials say they will attempt to redraft an emergency ban on 
commercial fishing for white croaker off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The prohibition could be imposed if it is changed to conform more closely to 
the state law authorizing such steps, according to John Smith, chief counsel 
for the administrative law office. 
</P>
<P>
But although fish and game officials said they plan to submit a revamped 
proposal, some of them said they doubt the state will wind up with a measure 
that can be effectively enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"We may as well not write a regulation," DeWayne Johnston, chief of the state 
Department of Fish and Game's wildlife protection division, said Wednesday. "We 
may not have any ability to enforce." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the office of administrative law rejected a measure proposed by the 
Fish and Game Department that would have banned commercial white croaker 
fishing in a three-mile-wide band of state waters from Point Fermin to Point 
Vicente. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal had been made on the recommendation of state health officials, who 
cited a recent study showing that white croaker caught off the peninsula carry 
excessive levels of the pesticide DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
Tons of the cancer-causing chemicals were discharged into the sea south of the 
peninsula through the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts' sewage outfalls 
in the 1950s, '60s and '70s, contaminating the ocean bottom where white croaker 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
Based on earlier studies, the state has warned recreational anglers since 1985 
not to eat white croaker caught off the peninsula. But no action has been taken 
to restrict commercial harvesting of the fish -- known locally as kingfish and 
tom cod -- even though the sanitation districts have been recommending a ban 
since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the administrative law office rejected the proposed emergency ban, 
the first step toward a permanent prohibition, because portions of it exceed 
the scope of the state statute authorizing such emergency measures. 
</P>
<P>
One problem, he said, is that it would ban not only the taking of white croaker 
from peninsula waters but also its possession, sale or purchase. State law 
governing the type of ban sought by game and fish officials allows only 
prohibitions on the taking of a fish, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the proposed ban would target commercially registered 
fishing boats in addition to commercial fishing license holders. The state law 
authorizing such bans makes mention only of commercial license holders. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt they went beyond what the statute authorized," Smith said. He 
portrayed the problems as mainly technical, however. "If they clean up the 
language and limit (the ban) to what the statute authorizes them to do, I think 
they could probably do it." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday on Santa Monica Pier, supporters of the ban 
severely criticized the legal office's decision. State Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) portrayed it as an example of state foot-dragging on the white 
croaker issue. 
</P>
<P>
The legal office "is being used as some kind of bureaucratic obstacle," Hayden 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dorothy Green, president of the environmental group Heal the Bay: "We're 
really dismayed." 
</P>
<P>
Fish and game officials said they cannot comment in detail on the 
administrative law office's objections because they have not yet received them 
in writing. But they expressed several concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Limiting the ban to the taking of white croaker means enforcement officials may 
be able to act only if they witness the fish being hauled aboard boats, said 
Don Schultz, supervisor of the Fish and Game Department's marine resources 
division. 
</P>
<P>
If possession were to be included as an infraction, he said, officials might 
also be able to take action against fishermen found in the area with white 
croaker aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said failing to target commercially registered boats is a more serious 
drawback. Enforcement officials would not be able to check the registration 
numbers of boats fishing for white croaker off the peninsula and take action 
against those registered as commercial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if fishermen taking white croaker were to admit that they held a 
commercial license, Johnston said, they might also be able to get by with an 
excuse: "A commercial fisherman could say, 'Hey, I'm sportfishing today.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, however, said his agency still hopes it will be able to write an 
emergency ban that will be acceptable to the administrative law office -- and 
strong enough to stop commercial white croaker fishing in peninsula waters. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be refiling," he said, predicting that it will take about two weeks 
for the ban proposal to be redrawn and reconsidered by the administrative law 
office.

TROUBLES AT THE JOFFREY; 
</P>
<P>
JOFFREY SPENT PAYROLL TAX TO STAY IN BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
MONEY: INTERNAL PROBLEMS ARE FUELED BY A GROWING DEBT TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE 
SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For at least the past two years, the Joffrey Ballet's chief financial officer 
has periodically delayed paying payroll deduction taxes to the Internal Revenue 
Service in order to ensure that the financially beleaguered dance company would 
obtain desperately needed grant money from the National Endowment for the Arts, 
according to minutes of a April 6 Joffrey board meeting. The total held back 
amounted to at least $828,000. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting fiscal chaos -- apparently hidden by Joffrey executives from the 
55-member board of managing directors until last month -- grew so out of 
control that, as recently as April 6, according to the minutes, members of the 
Joffrey's finance committee were being told in a closed door meeting that the 
35-year-old dance company was "two to three weeks away from being bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
At that same meeting, chief financial officer Lillian Piro tendered her 
resignation in a two-page letter to the finance committee, made available to 
The Times, only to be told that any decision to let her go would be delayed 
until June "to ensure the survival of the company." By June, the Joffrey would 
end its Los Angeles engagement and the new fiscal year would kick in with 
expectations of new corporate contributions and government grants. 
</P>
<P>
Piro, contacted Wednesday at the New York headquarters office of the Joffrey, 
declined to comment on either the Joffrey's financial situation or her own 
resignation letter. 
</P>
<P>
Public audit statements, tax filings, Piro's resignation letter and minutes 
from the April 6 meeting, all obtained by The Times, show a number of unusual 
accounting practices and optimistic fund-raising goals, dating back nearly a 
decade. Since 1983, the Joffrey has operated at a greater loss each year, 
except for 1986, according to the dance company's annual audit statements. In 
that year, the company's year-end deficit was $150,454 -- about $107,000 
smaller than the deficit from 1985. Since then, however, the Joffrey has 
finished each fiscal year, on June 30, with more and more red ink until last 
year, when its losses were nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Including its outstanding taxes, interest and penalties, plus several hundred 
thousand dollars in existing unpaid bills, the bicoastal company may be heading 
for its first $2 million year-end deficit in June. 
</P>
<P>
In her resignation letter, Piro said she started withholding payroll tax 
payments last fall in order to pay dancers, staff employees, the Joffrey's 
travel agency, trucking company and shoe supplier. She did that, she said, to 
keep the troupe active and to bring in revenue at the box office so that the 
company would not have to close. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that it would be better to have the company perform to generate more 
income (cash) coming in each week from our Washington, D.C., engagement, our 
New York season, Orange County and Los Angeles "Nutcracker" performances," Piro 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Like Joffrey executive director Penelope Curry and other key executives in New 
York and Los Angeles, Piro had been counting on contributions, grants, 
donations and large audiences at each of the winter performances of the dance 
company in order to make up for the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Twice before -- once in 1988 and again last summer -- Joffrey IRS payroll tax 
payments were withheld, according to minutes of the April 6 meeting, to 
maintain a smooth cash flow and to meet minimum requirements for the matching 
grant program of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the Joffrey has received annual NEA grants which require 
that the nonprofit Foundation for the Joffrey Ballet, Inc. maintain a $750,000 
cash reserve fund. In order to keep that fund at a level that is satisfactory 
to the NEA auditors, money due the IRS was put into the account so that the 
company would not lose its NEA matching grant, according to minutes of the 
April 6 meeting. Last year, the Joffrey stood to lose $243,000 in NEA Challenge 
III grant money. Just last month, the NEA announced a new matching grant for 
the Joffrey of $245,000. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted at his office in Washington, D.C., this week, NEA Inspector General 
Leon Lilly told The Times he was unaware of the Joffrey's financial problems or 
its practice of banking withholding taxes in its cash reserve fund in order to 
obtain NEA grant money. 
</P>
<P>
As early as June 1988, the Joffrey's own auditors warned the board of directors 
and staff management that borrowing from the cash reserve fund might jeopardize 
their NEA grants. 
</P>
<P>
"All borrowings from the fund shall be repaid within two years of the date of 
borrowing," wrote auditors for the accounting firm of Lutz and Carr. "At June 
30, 1988, the Foundation was not in compliance with these terms." 
</P>
<P>
Last June, according to the April 6 minutes, Piro told board member Edward 
Weinstein that she put $220,000 in tax liability money into the cash reserve 
account instead of paying the IRS. As a result, the Joffrey got its NEA grant 
but also had to pay about $18,000 in penalties and interest to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Again last fall, additional IRS tax payments were withheld. By year's end, the 
Joffrey owed $488,295.53 to the IRS. As of April 6, the company had paid 
$55,295.78, but had also incurred $37,307 in penalties and interest on the 
unpaid tax bill. As a result, the Joffrey owed $470,551.75 to the government 
just for its unpaid taxes from October, November and December of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A check for $119,705.79 to pay for overdue payroll taxes from last summer 
bounced in January, triggering an IRS penalty of $35,878.16. As of last month, 
the troupe had not paid $201,235.82 in taxes for the first three months of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
If the Joffrey paid $50,000 a week until the end of June, the committee was 
told on April 6, it would be able to pay off its outstanding IRS debt. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal problems grew worse when Curry told the finance committee about a 
mystery item on the plus side of the ledger: $790,694 in "unidentified 
contributions." She explained that the money had not materialized as she had 
expected, in part because many Joffrey donors had adopted a "wait and see" 
attitude due to the company's "internal problems". 
</P>
<P>
Finance committee member David Holbrook, president of Marsh and McLennan, Inc., 
New York, spelled out the "internal problems" as an ongoing feud between 
executive director Penelope Curry and artistic director Gerald Arpino. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Arpino and Ms. Curry cannot work together as a team, the company will 
close," Holbrook said at the April 6 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Joffrey co-chairman David Murdock spearheaded a drastic 
reorganization of the largely ceremonial 55-member board of managing directors, 
concentrating decision-making power in a 15-member operating committee that he 
heads. On a 31-9 vote, the managing directors approved Murdock's plan, which 
allowed for the immediate appointment of nine directors to the committee who, 
in turn, would select the remaining six members. (One appointee, Stephanie 
French, has declined to serve.) Murdock has been out of the country on business 
for the past week and is unavailable for comment, according to a spokeswoman 
for his Westwood-based Pacific Holding Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Arpino and several board members resigned in protest following the Murdock 
action, launching a civil war within the troubled organization that many 
Joffrey patrons fear will destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after resigning, Arpino forbade the Joffrey from using either his own 
works or those of the late founder of the company, Robert Joffrey. As executor 
of Joffrey's estate, Arpino maintains he has control over licensing 
performances of his dances. In ongoing negotiations, Arpino's representatives 
and the Joffrey board have come to a day-by-day interim agreement allowing for 
performance of the two mens' works. 
</P>
<P>
Curry has been critical of Arpino's spending. In October, she told the board of 
directors that he had gone $150,000 over budget on the development of his 
newest ballet, "TWO-A-DAY." Arpino subsequently told board member Barbara Levy 
Kipper, chairman of Chicago-based Levy Circulating Company, that his own 
accounting showed that he had actually come in $7,700 under budget in 
developing "TWO-A-DAY." 
</P>
<P>
Arpino's resignation could not have come at a worse time for the Los Angeles 
run of the dance troupe's season. Performances began May 2 at the Music Center 
with several of Arpino's ballets already established in the schedule. A 
centerpiece of the annual fund raising efforts by the Los Angeles Friends of 
the Joffrey is a $1,000-per-person series of special performances. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the series raised $480,000 and netted $244,700 after paying out 
$235,300 in salaries, music, food, decorations, printing, stationery and other 
overhead expenses. The Friends of the Joffrey also tried to hold a raffle until 
it was advised by the Los Angeles Social Service Department that a raffle 
cannot be sanctioned by the city as a recognized charitable event.

RECORD INDUSTRY UNVEILS WARNING LABEL; 
</P>
<P>
ADVISORY: LOGO WARNS CONSUMERS, PARENTS OF POTENTIALLY OFFENSIVE LYRICS.

<P>
A standardized warning sticker identifying albums that contain potentially 
offensive lyrics is expected to begin appearing on compact discs, cassettes and 
vinyl records by early July. 
</P>
<P>
The small, black and white sticker, which was developed over the last six weeks 
in meetings with representatives of the nation's leading record companies, was 
unveiled at a press conference Wednesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The recording industry hopes that the sticker, which reads "Parental Advisory 
-- Explicit Lyrics," will help consumers and parents identify potentially 
offensive recordings prior to sale. The industry also hopes that the sticker 
will help to head off a variety of legal challenges that the record business 
has been facing in more than a dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the uniform logo will enhance the existing voluntary system and 
better respond to the legitimate concerns of parents," said Jay Berman, 
president of the Recording Industry Assn., which represents the nation's major 
record labels. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference, he added, "Now that we have agreed on this 
new logo, it will be up to parents to use it as they see fit." 
</P>
<P>
John Mitchell, attorney for the National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers, said 
the nation's record retailers also support the new sticker. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very user-friendly parental advisory," he said in a phone interview 
from his Washington office. "I think retailers will respond favorably." 
</P>
<P>
The logo was developed in response to parents' complaints over allegedly 
offensive lyrics and numerous state legislative proposals to mandate warning 
stickers. The new sticker will be permanently attached underneath the 
cellophane shrink rap in the the lower right hand corner of compact discs, 
cassettes or albums. 
</P>
<P>
State proposals are still pending in Delaware, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania 
and Louisiana, but in light of the organized industry agreement to voluntarily 
standardize stickering of explicit records, lawmakers in 14 states have 
withdrawn their warning sticker bills. 
</P>
<P>
Refering to the new logo, Florida Rep. Joseph Arnall, who withdrew his bill on 
May 2, said by phone: "I am pleased that we have been able to work together to 
come to an agreement. I think we have a much stronger agreement than the one 
reached in 1985." 
</P>
<P>
However, Louisiana Rep. Ted Haik, who introduced a trio of "offensive" record 
labeling bills in April, told The Times on Wednesday that he has his doubts 
about whether the record industry intends to live up to the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one legislator who is not going to withdraw his bill until I see some 
positive action," Haik said. "My proposal stays put until the record industry 
proves to me that it is serious about regulating such material." 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Parents Music Resource Center, which engineered the 
original agreement to voluntarily sticker explicit albums in 1985, also 
supports the new standardized logo. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very favorable outcome," center executive director Jennifer Norwood 
said Tuesday in anticipation of Wednesday's press conference. "This 
standardized label is a fabulous development." 
</P>
<P>
No independent monitoring agency has been created to establish guidelines as to 
what is or what is not considered "explicit." Each record company, in 
consultation with its artists will determine which recordings will display the 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
Although most record companies have committed to enforce the implementation of 
the industry-wide stickering program, few believe it will increase the amount 
of records being stickered. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Merlis, vice president of publicity at Warner Brothers Records, said his 
company will use the new stickers instead of the stickers previously employed 
by Warner Bros., but doesn't expect any change in the policy that determines 
which records get stickered. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the text of certain warning stickers has been criticized as an 
enticement for consumers to buy suggestive material," Merlis said. "But this 
new RIAA logo can not possibly be viewed as a marketing ploy. For those who 
feel it is necessary, the new logo will truly provide a parental advisory." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some record companies maintain that placing warning labels on records is 
a violation of artistic freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution. According 
to company spokespersons at I.R.S. and Virgin Records, neither company has ever 
stickered any album, nor intends to start. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ayeroff, managing director of Virgin Records, was unavailable for comment 
Wednesday, but he is quoted in the current issue of Rolling Stone as saying, "I 
find it repugnant that the record industry in general is knuckling under to 
right wing extremists." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers fear that voluntarily imposed warning labels may cause 
many of the same problems as government-mandated stickers. Standardized warning 
labels, they say, could stigmatize controversial recordings, making such albums 
an easy target for boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
"While I believe the RIAA logo makes the best of a bad situation, I'm fearful 
that the logo could be used like a tattoo on the forearm of the artistic 
community," Michael Greene, president of National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences, said. "It certainly does create a visible target, in the sense that 
labeled product could easily be singled out and removed by nervous retailers." 
</P>
<P>
NARM attorney Mitchell agreed: "The logo will not alleviate the problem with 
specific instances in various states regarding violation of local obscenity 
statutes. When prosecutors or judges deem a record obscene, the cheapest 
solution for a retailer is to stop selling the record. But I don't perceive 
this type of activity as a trend." 
</P>
<P>
Explicit albums have been banned in a number of communities around the country. 
"As Nasty as They Wanna Be," a sexually explicit album by the Miami-based rap 
group 2 Live Crew, has been deemed obscene in four judicial districts in 
Florida and also in some counties in Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Wisconsin and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing prosecution under local obscenity ordinances, many record store owners 
have removed questionable "offensive" product from their shelves and 
discontinued selling records with warning labels to anyone under 18. The 
450-store Albany, N.Y.-based Trans World Corp., and the 119-store Owensbury, 
Ky.-based Wax Works/Disc Jockey chain have enacted such policies. 
</P>
<P>
The 752-store Musicland group, the nation's largest record store operator that 
includes Musicland and Sam Goody outlets in Southern California, recently 
instituted a similar rule. And according to Mitch Perlis, director of 
purchasing at Show Industries, the 73-store Los Angeles-based Music Plus chain 
will soon follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the RIAA logo is a very positive move," Perlis said. "It's what we, as 
retailers, have been asking for. The standardized sticker will make our job 
infinitely easier because it will give our salespeople an opportunity to know 
what they're selling. Still, Music Plus is in the process of developing an 
18-and-over policy for purchases of stickered product." 
</P>
<P>
Priority Records, a company that has been voluntarily stickering since 1985, is 
well aware of the political controversy surrounding provocative pop music. Last 
year, the Los Angeles-based record label received a "policy" letter from the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation charging that a song by N.W.A, a rap group on 
Priority's roster, encouraged violence against law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully this sticker will short circuit some of the state legislative 
proposals calling for government-mandated labels. But I don't think the battle 
is over. It's going to get worse," Priority Records president Bryan Turner said 
Wednesday. "If nothing else, the new logo will give the creative community a 
chance to regroup and figure out how we're going to combat the next wave of 
fundamentalists who want to change our Constitution."

O'CONNOR WON'T SING ON 'SNL' IN PROTEST OVER ANDREW DICE CLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hot-selling pop singer Sinead O'Connor decided Wednesday to pull out of her 
scheduled appearance on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" this weekend, saying she 
did not want to appear on the same program with guest host Andrew Dice Clay. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's decision came two days after "SNL" cast member Nora Dunn announced 
that she would not appear on the show as a protest against Clay's comedy 
routines, which are laced with expletives and feature jokes about sexual 
violence that have been criticized as anti-women. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nonsensical of 'Saturday Night Live' to expect a woman to perform 
songs about a woman's experience after a monologue by Andrew Dice Clay," the 
23-year-old O'Connor said in a prepared statement. "I feel it shows disrespect 
to women that 'Saturday Night Live' expected me to perform on the same show as 
Andrew Dice Clay." 
</P>
<P>
Lorne Michaels, the producer of "Saturday Night Live," told The Times that 
O'Connor's decision was "unfortunate for us because we confirmed Sinead at the 
beginning of the year, and we're not asking her to endorse Andrew Dice Clay -- 
we were merely asking her to sing two songs. What gets lost in all of this is 
that this is a comedian we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Clay, whom a representative earlier had said would have no comment on Dunn's 
decision, could not be reached regarding O'Connor's action. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, a Dublin-born singer who has both the No. 1 single and the No. 1 
album on the pop charts, made her decision after spending the day listening to 
and watching tapes of Dice's performances in her New York hotel room. According 
to her publicist, Elaine Schock, the singer, who arrived in New York on 
Tuesday, had not been familiar with Clay's work and did not know that he had 
been booked as the guest host on the show until Monday, shortly after NBC 
announced that it had signed him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a late booking, she lives in the United Kingdom, and she had no idea 
what he was like," Schock said. The materials that O'Connor received on 
Wednesday were provided by a representative of Dunn, she said, after tapes that 
O'Connor had requested through her record company did not arrive in time. Shock 
also had been contacted by members of the New York City chapter of the National 
Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
But, Schock emphasized, "Sinead made her own decision after looking at the 
tapes and being offended. That's the way she makes her decisions. She wasn't 
under any pressure from anybody, and she never talked to Nora Dunn." 
</P>
<P>
Francoise Jacobson, president of the National Organization for Women chapter 
here, confirmed that her group had contacted Schock and Liz Welch, the talent 
coordinator for "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
"We expressed our dismay to the talent coordinator that they would choose such 
a misogynist as the host," Jacobson said in an interview. "His whole routine is 
based on negative and sexist and homophobic attitudes. There's a rising 
incidence of hate crimes on college campuses, and this kind of routine only 
adds fuel to the fire because it makes it more acceptable to hold women and 
gays in low regard." 
</P>
<P>
"SNL" cast member Victoria Jackson said Wednesday that she would not be joining 
Dunn in her stance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any cast member has the right to decide not to come to work 
based on the host's stand-up comedy," Jackson said. "Sam Kinison (who has 
hosted the show) makes fun of Jesus, and I didn't like that. But I don't think 
our contract with the show allows us to discriminate against the host. I think 
most people in the cast feel the same way, and I don't expect any other cast 
members not to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who co-starred with Clay in the recent movie "Casual Sex," said that 
she could see that Dunn "has a point" about some of Clay's jokes. But, she 
added, "he makes fun of everybody -- gay people and black people and women -- 
so how could you be offended? It's stupid to be offended." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, added Jackson, "The skits on the show would never have been like his 
stand-up act -- we're a network show." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Monday with the Associated Press, Dunn said that she found 
Clay's popular comedy act so degrading and "hateful" that she did not want to 
help him promote his career through "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be part of providing an arena for him to make himself 
legitimate because I don't think he is. Although I feel he has a right to 
express himself, I have a right to strongly state my position." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Michaels told The Times that while he supported Dunn's right to make 
her decision, he thought she should have made her feelings known to him 
directly before speaking to the press. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was perfectly admirable to follow her conscience, but it would 
have been nice if she'd made her feelings known to me and other cast members 
before going to the press," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michaels, talent coordinator Welch had told him Monday that Dunn 
had called her to express her unhappiness over the booking of Clay. 
</P>
<P>
"I suggested that Nora come in to talk about it," said Michaels, who noted that 
the show had been on hiatus and going back and forth about hosts for the May 
sweeps shows.

TROUBLES AT THE JOFFREY; 
</P>
<P>
NEW CHANGES, BUT NO REFUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A deceptive air of business-as-usual infused Tuesday night's Joffrey Ballet 
performance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Although the printed programs 
still listed Gerald Arpino as artistic director, they simply omitted any 
mention of the three Arpino ballets originally scheduled for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Page J-13 informed all and sundry that the May 8 program consisted 
of Arpino's "Italian Suite," "Sea Shadow" and "TWO-A-DAY." Now -- 
presto-chango! -- Page J-13 was gone. On a brand new Page J-4, the fare was 
listed as Paul Taylor's "Arden Court," Frederick Ashton's "Illuminations" and 
Vaslav Nijinsky's "Le Sacre du Printemps." 
</P>
<P>
No printed or verbal explanations were given for the change, or for the taped 
music by William Boyce that accompanied "Arden Court," usually performed with a 
live orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of patrons who had set their hearts on seeing the Arpino triad asked 
for refunds. They were offered free tickets for other Joffrey performances. One 
was overheard complaining to the house manager about the lack of toe shoes in 
the Taylor work, and a few deserted at the intermissions. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the switch had to do with a legal wrangle over Arpino's rights 
to works he choreographed before abruptly quitting the company he co-founded 
after a recent reorganization of its management structure. (See accompanying 
article.) 
</P>
<P>
Company management decided to pull the Arpino repertory from the performance 
schedule while the dispute is simmering. (The next Arpino evening is on 
Sunday.) Since "Arden Court" wasn't supposed to be on any of the Los Angeles 
programs, local musicians presumably weren't prepared to play it. 
</P>
<P>
It was ironic that an audience that came to be lulled, dazzled and amused was 
instead obliged to encounter some of the more trickily brilliant items the 
Joffrey has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Narbutas once again offered an extraordinary Poet in "Illuminations," 
lunging and lounging through his phantasmagoric world with an air at once 
sneering and dazed. The familiar pairing of Charlene Gehm as Sacred Love and 
Beatriz Rodriguez as Profane Love also has not lost its luster. Gehm's 
ultra-refined, almost tremulous delicacy in the "Being Beauteous" section was 
exquisitely unearthly. 
</P>
<P>
The tenor singing the poems by Arthur Rimbaud set to Benjamin Britten's music 
was Grayson Hirst; unfortunately, program information wasn't updated for the 
current state of emergency, and Hirst was listed only as singing on Thursday, 
when the season's first performance of "Illuminations" would have been 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was previously reviewed as the Chosen One in the company's fiercely 
primal "Sacre," as was the cast of "Arden Court." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the audience seemed unmoved by their good fortune. "Illuminations" -- 
which drew laughter at the height of the Poet's tortured journey through life 
-- got a few enthusiastic whistles. And the company's prodigious efforts in 
"Sacre" received only a thin spatter of applause from those who didn't scurry 
away at curtain-fall.

EYE PROBLEMS CLOUD PRYOR'S COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: WISCONSIN AGREES TO SANCTION BOUT EVEN THOUGH FORMER CHAMPION HAS 
UNDERGONE SURGERY FOR A DETACHED RETINA AND HAS CATARACTS IN HIS LEFT EYE.

Former junior welterweight champion Aaron Pryor, his career shadowed by serious 
eye and drug problems, said Wednesday he has no fear of losing his sight if he 
returns to the ring next week to fight Daryl Jones. 
</P>
<P>
But boxing officials in states which had refused Pryor a license because he had 
undergone surgery for a detached retina and has cataracts clouding his left eye 
criticized Wisconsin's decision to let him fight. 
</P>
<P>
"In Pryor's case, if you go into the ring with one eye, you'd better be 
prepared to get a guide dog," said Don Muse, assistant executive director of 
the California State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't even let fighters fight here with detached retinas. Not too long ago, 
we blocked an exhibition bout by Sugar Ray Leonard at a shopping center because 
he had a detached retina." 
</P>
<P>
But Pryor, a junior welterweight champion from 1980-85 before his career was 
scuttled by drug problems, said he proved in a December exhibition against 
former Olympian Howard Davis that he is ready to return to the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard Davis has the fastest hands in boxing. It proved that I can see and I'm 
ready to fight," said Pryor, who had planned to face Hector Comacho in Las 
Vegas for a much larger payday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed I got turned down in Vegas," said Pryor, who hasn't fought 
since beating Herminio Morales with a third-round knockout in December of 1988. 
"Wisconsin spelled out the difference between a fighter having a handicap and 
being disabled. I think Vegas should take that into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Gordon, chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, said he would 
start sending faxes to Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson to stop the fight that is 
scheduled for May 16 at the Masonic Temple in Madison. Pryor is under 
suspension in New York until he passes an eye test. 
</P>
<P>
"Without sounding hysterical, I believe that we the commission and the media 
almost have to appeal to the governor of Wisconsin for a stay of execution for 
Aaron Pryor," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bad for boxing and bad for the state of Wisconsin," said Dr. James 
Nave, chairman of the Nevada State Athletic Commission which voted 4-1 last 
month not to allow Pryor to box in that state. "We spent a tremendous amount of 
time researching this case and I don't think Wisconsin looked at what we 
researched before coming to our decision." 
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing granted Pryor a license 
after he signed a statement that he understood the risks, and he absolved the 
state of any liability if he's hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Wisconsin considers his cataracts a condition of handicap rather 
than a medical condition, and the state has strict laws against discrimination 
against the handicapped. Pryor underwent testing by a physician and an 
ophthamologist in Wisconsin before getting approval on Monday to box. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Cummings, secretary of regulation licensing, said Wednesday that Dr. 
Suresh Chandra, a Madison ophthamologist, examined Pryor and reported that 
"there is some impairment." 
</P>
<P>
"But he is not legally blind. He said the choice should be Aaron's and it was 
his choice to make," Cummings said Wednesday. "We've followed Dr. Chandra's 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Wisconsin has a pretty strong anti-discrimination law. He clearly has a 
disability. Some people say you must protect some people from themselves. I've 
seen him spar, jump rope and shoot baskets. Our concern was that if he took the 
risk, he'd be aware of the risk. Dr. Chandra talked with him for two hours 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
But Gordon said Cummings wasn't qualified to determine if Pryor can box. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't know a left hook from a fish hook. And she went out to the gym and 
took a look at him and saw him spar. Is that cause enough to give a man who is 
under medical suspension a license?" 
</P>
<P>
Pryor said the detached retina and cataracts were in the left eye and that his 
right eye was 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my doctor and five other doctors say they are good to fight," Pryor 
said. "I'm fighting this for $4,000 or $5,000 and I could have signed against 
Camacho for half a million dollars. I have been preparing for Camacho for five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are some political things involved." 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Pryor filed a motion in Hamilton County Municipal Court in 
Cincinnati saying he should receive treatment for drug dependency rather than a 
conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested last September in Cincinnati by police who said they found a 
pipe that could be used to smoke crack cocaine in Pryor's car. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor said Wednesday he is a drug free and completed a month-long 
rehabilitation program in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in decent shape but my nerves are bad because people are trying to tell me 
what to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor (37-1) won the WBA junior welterweight title in 1980, knocking out 
Antonio Cervantes. He defended his title seven times, twice beating Alexis 
Arguello. 
</P>
<P>
There is controversy over Jones' record. One boxing service lists it at 13-12, 
while matchmaker Stan Johnson says it is 26-7.

SMALL BUSINESSES GAIN NEW CLOUT IN WASHINGTON 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, when San Antonio truck parts dealer Mike Manuppelli went calling on 
Congress, the best he could manage was some meetings with a couple of 
legislative aides who only half-listened to what he said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he returned to Washington a few days ago, he got the personal 
attention of two Texas senators and three representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Manuppelli is still the same fellow who owns Automotive Truck Parts Co. in San 
Antonio and belongs to Texas Small Business United, a grass-roots lobbying 
group. 
</P>
<P>
What's different is that small business has learned how to flex its political 
muscle, and Congress has gotten the message. In fact, the red carpet has been 
out all this week for small-business owners and their families being honored 
during the Small Business Administration's Small Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
Business owners from 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico 
descended on the city for a frenzy of awards ceremonies, speeches and events. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous difference just in a 12-month period," said Manuppelli. 
"The people we visited with this time were not only much more receptive, but 
they really wanted to know the pulse of the small-business owners." 
</P>
<P>
And, on Monday, while scores of small-business owners swarmed in and out of 
offices on Capitol Hill, President Bush's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, 
personally assured representatives of several business groups that the 
President would veto any bill requiring businesses to provide unpaid maternity 
or family leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every small-business organization has been loudly opposing mandated 
leave, so Bush's promise was the latest victory for their lobbying efforts.

The leaders of the congressional small business committees say the winds have 
shifted in favor of the little guy since last fall's repeal of Section 89, a 
tax law that outraged the small-business community. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, business owners protested against Section 89, a 
regulation riddled with eye-crossing formulas that would have required business 
owners to provide the same kinds of benefits to entry level employees as they 
provided executives. 
</P>
<P>
"I think small-business organizations feel prouder of themselves now and are 
aware that they have more clout," said Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.), who 
serves as chairman of the Committee on Small Business. "I do think there is 
strength in numbers." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, small-business groups have rallied to oppose mandated health 
care, portions of the Americans with Disabilities Act and an inheritance tax 
law that imposes a burden on family-owned firms trying to pass the company 
along to the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators and Bush are seeking out small-business support for their favorite 
issues by being more accessible, according to veteran small-business advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen an incredible recognition of small business on the Hill," said 
Christine Russell, chief House lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Russell, who until recently served as director of the chamber's Small Business 
Center, said legislators are listening more closely to small-business owners 
because their companies are the ones creating most of America's new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's satisfying to have people calling us rather than us going to camp out on 
their doorsteps," said John Satagaj, president of the Small Business 
Legislative Council, which represents 103 trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Boldt, chairman and chief executive of BMI Inc., a Palatine, Ill., maker of 
clips and clamps, said he has been lobbying in Washington since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1980, it was 'what is small business and why is it different from big 
business?' " said Boldt, who attended a recent joint meeting of National Small 
Business United and the National Assn. of Women Business Owners in Washington. 
"Now they realize there is a position between the unions and big business." 
</P>
<P>
Art Sweet, president of Certified Business Funding, a North Hollywood 
small-business lender, agreed that legislators are taking what he has to say 
more seriously than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"They really want to find out what's right for small business," said Sweet. "I 
do feel we are getting our message across." 
</P>
<P>
The small-business owners also feel a strong comradeship with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Krieger, president of the 50,000 member National Small Business United, 
called Bush "a small-business President" who is "right with us on 90% of the 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who owned his own small oil drilling company in Texas feels, a kinship 
with the small-business community, according to Jeff Vogt, a business liaison 
for the White House. Bush also hopes his small-business friends will get behind 
his move to reduce the capital gains tax and reduce the budget deficit without 
raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The President feels they will roll up their sleeves and get to work for him on 
Capitol Hill," said Vogt. 
</P>
<P>
After the visiting small-business owners have returned home, representatives of 
the National Federation of Independent Business, which has 500,000 members, and 
National Small Business United, will remain behind to look out for their 
members' interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Small-business owners can do for politics in the 1990s what labor unions did 
in the 1950s," said John Sloan, president of the National Federation of 
Independent Business. "I think we are just gaining momentum, and there are 
still very exciting times ahead of us in what we can accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
John Galles, executive vice president of National Small Business United, said 
the 1990s are going to be very tough on small business because of uncertainty 
about the economy and the threat interference by government in business 
affairs. "Small-business owners need to do battle to protect their interests," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in California, the California Chamber of Commerce is forming a coalition 
of small-business groups to strengthen any positions taken, according to Maxine 
Weinman, the politically active owner of Maxine's Seafood Cafe in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, there still needs to be more unification between the 
small-business groups," said Weinman, who serves as legislative chair for the 
Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. of Women Business Owners. 
</P>
<P>
But, Weinman said small business' political clout does not yet match its 
economic clout in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every week I get a letter from a legislator asking for input on issues 
affecting small business," said Devon Blaine, president of the California 
chapter of National Small Business United.

INNOVATION: A TINY SOLUTION FOR TODAY'S BIG PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The palate of pseudomonas aeruginosa is discriminating without being fussy, 
robust without being ravenous, and curious without being intrusive. This is 
clearly a microbe with panache. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be a very flexible bacteria," says Bio-Care Chairman Bob Larvie, 
whose young Campbell, Calif.-based company packages and sells them to 
restaurants at $20 a pop to help manage garbage disposal. "They eat most of the 
biological, animal and oleaginous waste materials of any kind: detergents, 
shampoos. . . . Grease is a feast for these guys, a four-star meal." You can 
buy these Agriculture Department-approved microcritters for your septic tank 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Exxon and the Environmental Protection Agency discovered that 
there's nothing like a dash of Inipol -- a French-made fertilizer -- to 
stimulate the growth and appetites of hydrocarbon-munching microorganisms on 
the oil-stained beaches around Alaska's Prince William Sound, the inlet where 
the Exxon Valdez tanker dumped its crude. "There were much more dramatic 
surface results than anyone had predicted," enthuses the University of 
Louisville's Ronald M. Atlas, a biologist who has been a pioneer in bacterial 
bioremediation for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
We've built microprocessors to process data; we can now build microorganisms to 
process waste. "Everyone's back yard is filled with billions of bacteria that 
are capable of degrading pollutants," says Louisville's Atlas. The trick is to 
identify, cultivate and nurture the right ones. The beauty of this approach is 
that, in most cases, we can work with naturally occurring bacteria -- bacteria 
that have already been tested by the rigors of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the back-to-nature pollution cure," says Atlas. "Bioremediation is taking 
advantage of natural processes and stimulating them to help them along." But at 
the same time, the clever design of microbial intervention could be used as 
much to limit pollution as clean it up. What we have in bioremediation is the 
opportunity to craft macroecologies of microorganisms -- self-regulating 
environments that strike a new and better balance between society's ability to 
generate waste and nature's ability to accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
Smokestacks belching pollution? Install membranes of sulfur-hungry 
microcritters to leech out the noxious gases. Landfills about to burst? Seed 
the sites with microbial cocktails that will accelerate the processes of 
natural decay. Toxic waste sites? Don't dig up the soil and incinerate. Douse 
it with the microorganisms capable of cracking its compounds into substances 
less harsh and more easily manageable. 
</P>
<P>
Ground-water problems? The right bacteria in the right doses could solve them. 
Cost-effective? Heck, yes! This product replenishes itself with waste. 
</P>
<P>
Picture how chemical refineries, semiconductor plants and materials processing 
sites would be redesigned as -- at various points -- living, dynamic microbial 
screens. The screens could be used to strain out and metabolize the guck and 
grunge that would otherwise end up as potentially toxic pollutants, which would 
have to be either burned or buried. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, not all substances are vulnerable to microbiological assault. 
Plastics and PCBs may need super-microorganisms endowed with special powers 
granted only by skilled genetic engineers. One could build in "suicide genes" 
that would kill them off once their work was done. "Actually," says Atlas, who 
serves on the National Institutes of Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory 
Committee, "the need for genetically engineered organisms to manage waste is 
limited." 
</P>
<P>
However, it would be neat to design a microcritter that could live in the 
hostile environment of an automobile exhaust system and help cleanse the smoke, 
because automobiles are a major source of air pollution. Or maybe some bacteria 
that can live in the gas tank and help rid the fuel of potentially noxious 
impurities. 
</P>
<P>
The point is obvious: We're at the beginning of an explosion of what might 
prove to be an exceptionally powerful and pervasive technology. There's not yet 
a regulatory framework; the EPA, NIH, USDA and Office of Management and Budget 
can't decide who's responsible (or not responsible) for what. Atlas estimates 
that there are literally a thousand companies out there -- each organized 
around its own microbe du jour. "I must have been contacted by venture 
capitalists at least a hundred times last year," he shrugs. There's a lot of 
ignorance and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask, 'What happens when you create teen-age mutant ninja bugs? Will 
they come out of the sewer and eat me?' " notes Bio-Care's Larvie. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the environmental impact of densely concentrated colonies of 
microbes is not a trivial matter, although Atlas stresses that "the presence of 
that pollutant creates an ecology of its own, too." The questions become even 
more clouded when you begin to intermix multiple ecologies of microbes -- 
genetically enhanced or not -- into supra-ecologies. The ability to make 
meaningful predictions about bacteria growth and mutation rates decays. It's 
clear that even seemingly "natural" solutions to waste pose stubborn 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
But it's equally clear that, with billions of kinds of bacteria out there, 
there are bound to be a couple of hundred that can deliver a lot of spic and 
span for comparatively little risk. I think the prospects of bioremediation 
become a fascinating challenge to the environmental movement too: Is this a 
technique that it can embrace as ecologically sound because it attempts to 
augment and enhance what nature does anyway? Or is it too "technological" and 
"artificial" to win the Green Earthkeeping Seal of Approval? 
</P>
<P>
Given the astonishing rate at which our knowledge of molecular biology expands 
and our ability to understand the inner mechanisms of microorganisms grows, 
there's no question that we will be able to explore a wide array of 
cost-effective bioremediation approaches within the next three to five years. 
What I find most exciting is that if this nascent technique can work well in 
even one domain -- smokestacks, ground water, landfills, toxic waste sites -- 
the global impact will be extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
But as the English critic and cynic Cyril Connolly once remarked, "Those whom 
the critics wish to destroy, they first call promising." The ingredients for 
success seem right: The technological infrastructure is there, the problems are 
there, the economics are tilting in the right direction. Yet, potential isn't 
achievement. However, when Bio-Care's Larvie says, "If this isn't a business 
for the '90s, I don't know what is," I can't help agreeing.

RTC MAY ALTER CD RATE RULES FOR FAILED S&amp;LS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: SAVERS WOULD BE ABLE TO LOCK IN HIGH RATES FOR AT LEAST THREE MONTHS 
AFTER A TAKEOVER.

Savers at failed thrifts may be able to keep their high rates on certificates 
of deposit longer. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Resolution Trust Corp. may soon change a policy that has permitted 
banks and other purchasers of insolvent thrifts to repudiate rates on CDs two 
weeks after taking over the institutions, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Many CD holders were negatively affected when the RTC -- the agency overseeing 
the thrift bailout -- adopted the controversial policy last year. In most 
cases, rates were replaced by lower ones. That hurt savers who had bought CDs 
at troubled thrifts because rates were higher. 
</P>
<P>
On May 16, the RTC staff will recommend a rule change that would require thrift 
acquirers to maintain the thrifts' CD rates for at least three months, 
officials said. The change is expected to be adopted by the RTC board. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Whitney, a spokesman for RTC Chairman L. William Seidman, said Seidman 
believes the change will provide more stability in the money market. 
</P>
<P>
Large depositors will be assured that their rates will be locked in for at 
least 90 days after a thrift is sold, Whitney said. That will enable them to 
compare CD rates to those of 90-day Treasury instruments. With such stability 
assured, troubled thrifts may not have to offer extremely high rates to attract 
depositors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rule change will allow buyers of failed S&amp;Ls to estimate 
more precisely their cost of obtaining deposit funds following the purchases, 
Whitney said.

A federal judge declared a mistrial Wednesday when a jury was unable to agree 
on damages that Ford Motor Co. should pay an inventor for infringing on his 
patents for a widely used windshield wiper system. 
</P>
<P>
Inventor Robert Kearns, a former engineering professor who lives in 
Gaithersburg, Md., was seeking $325 million in damages from the nation's 
second-largest auto maker in a case that other car makers have been watching 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn said the jury was hung, and he discharged it. 
"The court had determined that there is no useful purpose for them (the jury) 
to deliver it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohn said the jury had come to a near-unanimous verdict on a damage award but 
that there was one holdout who could not agree on the amount.

THE VENERABLE SHOPPING CART GETS SOUPED UP

<P>
You may not have read about it in your high school history book, but more than 
50 years ago an Oklahoma grocer named Sylvan Goldman changed the world. 
</P>
<P>
The place was the Humpty Dumpty market in Oklahoma City. The year was 1937. The 
invention: the shopping cart. It gets better. Just listen. 
</P>
<P>
"The shopping cart is a complex sociological phenomenon," said Gene von Stein, 
vice president of Unarco Commercial Products, the nation's shopping cart giant. 
"The shopping cart has totally changed the commerce and culture of America and 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
The jury may still be out on that, but the lowly cart does make the supermarket 
possible by giving shoppers a vehicle to purchase a week's worth of groceries 
in a single trip. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, this functional sculpture of wire on wheels has been 
the target of innovation -- increasingly electronic, occasionally designed to 
assist the consumer, more often an effort to sell more products. 
</P>
<P>
There are anti-theft gadgets and bolt-on baby seats, calculator/billboards and 
shopper tracking devices, carts for the kids and electronic tour guides. This 
week, they were all on display at the Food Marketing Institute's supermarket 
convention in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that shopping carts are going to get very space-age, but they're 
functional and they get a little better all the time," said Norman H. McMillan, 
a partner in the Chicago-based retail consulting firm McMillan/Dolittle. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, Goldman's pioneering pushcart was unveiled 53 years ago 
at the very first Supermarket Institute convention, the grandparent of FMI's 
annual industry extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1930s, mass general-merchandising stores were unknown and grocers 
gave their customers personal service. It was also a time when housewives 
shopped more often and bought fewer goods. 
</P>
<P>
When that began to change, von Stein said, Goldman devised hand-carry baskets 
that he furnished to customers at his Humpty Dumpty markets in Oklahoma City 
and Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he saw that shoppers would stop shopping when they got the baskets full," 
von Stein said. "The baskets were too heavy to carry. So he got the idea of 
putting the baskets on wheeled frames." 
</P>
<P>
By 1940, the company had developed the nesting shopping cart that can be found 
today in most grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The shopping cart has been the one piece of equipment essential to making 
self-service shopping a success," von Stein said. "And all of modern consumer 
product merchandising is based on the concept of self-service." 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, Smart Products Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., sold its first 
bolt-on baby seat, a device that fits over the traditional child chair and lets 
parents fill a shopping cart with food, not children. The company has sold 
20,000. 
</P>
<P>
ADDvantage Marketing offers a calculator that fits over the handle of the cart. 
It allows consumers to tally their purchases so they can figure out what's a 
better value: 16 ounces of detergent at $2.50 or 12 ounces at $1.75. It also 
has a mini-billboard with product advertising that stares up at shoppers for as 
long as they're on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Information Resources Inc. of Chicago offers an interactive video screen that 
bolts onto cart handles and can tell shoppers where to find up to 800 items in 
the store. In addition, markets that use the product are fitted with infrared 
triggers that signal the VideOcart screen as the shopper moves through the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"As you go through the aisles, ads are triggered on the screen, or aisle 
specials, or promotional information on new products," said Bill Dupre, a 
company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Unarco unveiled its latest product this week, a gadget called Promotronics that 
fits on the end of the shopping cart and flashes advertising messages at 
consumers. It also records how long shoppers spend in the aisles and in front 
of certain products -- valuable marketing information, von Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Some say, however, that shopping-cart innovation hasn't gone far enough -- that 
esoteric problems are being solved before basic components are perfected. 
</P>
<P>
Or as McMillan put it: "If anyone could ever figure out how to get the wheels 
to turn round and round endlessly, that could be more valuable than all of this 
gadgetry.

FUTURES TRIAL IS SIMPLY ABOUT FRAUD, JURY TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: THE PROSECUTOR, IN OPENING REMARKS, SAYS THE THREE DEFENDANTS ARE 
COMMON THIEVES. THE DEFENSE WILL STATE ITS CASE TODAY.

"Good things happen to those who help out." 
</P>
<P>
That simple sentence, allegedly said by commodities broker Robert Mosky to an 
undercover FBI agent posing as a fellow trader on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, lies at the heart of the government's case in its highly publicized 
attack against corruption on Chicago's big commodities markets. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the first to come to trial in the government's massive sting 
operation at both the Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Pollack told jurors 
that Mosky and two other traders charged with fraud and racketeering in the 
case were common thieves, conspiring to rip off their unseen customers to 
benefit each other, while hiding behind the complexities of the commodities 
futures markets to mask their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"Stripped to its barest essentials, this is a case about fraud," said Pollack. 
"The crimes they committed were simple, but the context in which they occurred 
certainly was complex. 
</P>
<P>
"But just because a thief wears a white trading jacket and does business with a 
deck of trading cards, doesn't mean he is any less a thief than a cat burglar." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's opening salvo by the prosecution -- to be followed today by an 
opening statement by the defense -- came nearly a year and a half after the 
government's undercover operation came to light in January, 1989, with a series 
of indictments against 47 brokers, traders and a clerk on both exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
In a controversial move, the government sought to charge the traders under the 
RICO, or racketeering, statute, which had been originally designed to fight the 
mob, rather than white-collar criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Using at least four undercover FBI agents who had been trained to act as 
traders, law enforcement officials penetrated the confusing world of 
commodities futures for the first time, after reportedly receiving complaints 
from customers on the commodities markets about fraudulent activity. 
</P>
<P>
Since the indictments were first announced, at least 18 traders and brokers 
have entered plea bargains with the government, agreeing to lesser charges in 
exchange for their cooperation and testimony against other traders. 
</P>
<P>
At least two traders, Mark Fuhrman and William Walsh, who worked alongside 
Mosky in the Swiss franc pit at the Merc, are expected to testify against him 
and the other two defendants in the case, David Zatz and Danny Scheck. 
</P>
<P>
Zatz and Scheck were local, independent traders who allegedly helped Mosky, a 
broker who worked for a number of large firms, in his efforts to bilk customers 
and skim profits from his trades. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, expected to last at least six weeks, will focus on the Swiss franc 
pit at the Merc, where the FBI stationed undercover agent Randall Jannett, 
posing as trader Randy Jackson, for 10 months in 1988. Trials covering brokers 
and traders from the Japanese yen pit at the Merc and the soybean pit at the 
Board of Trade are slated to begin in September. 
</P>
<P>
Jannett and his taped conversations with Mosky and others in the Swiss franc 
pit will thus represent the heart of the government's case. The later trials 
for yen traders and soybean traders are also likely to hinge on the testimony 
of undercover agents and their taped conversations, as well as on statements 
from traders who have agreed to act as government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the defense is expected to challenge the government's definitions of 
what should be considered illegal activity on the exchange, and also the 
introduction of Jannett's tape recordings, which Pollack admitted were hard to 
decipher because of the loud and chaotic background noise on the trading floor. 
</P>
<P>
He warned the jurors that they will have to sift through the background noise 
to "listen to the quieter, softer conversations that Jannett was listening to, 
in which the defendants were arranging secret, noncompetitive trades." 
</P>
<P>
Jannett won't testify for at least another week -- the prosecution and defense 
first hope to provide expert witnesses to help educate the jury on the 
intricacies of the commodities markets. 
</P>
<P>
But Pollack, in a detailed description of some of the fraudulent trading 
practices allegedly used in the Swiss franc pit, revealed some of the 
highlights from the evidence gathered by Jannett during his undercover stint. 
</P>
<P>
In one case revealed by Pollack on Wednesday, Jannett recorded Mosky and Scheck 
attempting to make one large side deal for a noncompetitive trade of 147 
contracts for Swiss francs. But just as they were about to complete the deal, 
another, unidentified trader saw what they were doing and complained; his 
objections can be heard on the tape, which will be played in court later in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Mosky and Scheck were allegedly forced to back off when publicly attacked by 
the fellow trader. They later completed a smaller side deal, Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
In another example, Pollack said Mosky asked Jannett to change the price of a 
trade they had just made in order to increase their profits. 
</P>
<P>
When Jannett started to cross out the price on his trading card, which is 
turned in at the end of the trading session to record deals, Mosky scolded him 
to conceal his work better. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better write up a new card, that's not going to fly," Mosky told the 
undercover agent. Later, Mosky again warned Jannett of "increased scrutiny" of 
trading at the Merc and told him to be careful in their side dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate to see you go to jail," Mosky said to Jannett.

Entertainment Company Wins Lawsuit: FM Entertainment Inc., which went bankrupt 
after a planned stock offering fell through in 1987, won a $3.5-million jury 
verdict against Morgan Olmstead Kennedy &amp; Gardner, an investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Monica Superior Court jury ruled that Morgan Olmstead should pay the 
sum to FM, the company behind such films as "Witness" and "The Golden Child." 
In its suit, FM maintained that Morgan Olmstead reneged on an oral agreement to 
handle the public offering in 1986. The investment company plans to appeal the 
verdict.

ANOTHER COLUMBIA S&amp;L OFFICIAL TO LEAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Another senior executive at Columbia Savings &amp; Loan is leaving the troubled 
Beverly Hills thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel C. Rohr, Columbia's executive vice president and chief credit officer, 
will join First Bank System in Minneapolis on May 21 as executive vice 
president and manager of the bank's commercial banking group. 
</P>
<P>
A former Continental Bank executive, Rohr, 44, will work for First Bank 
Chairman John F. Grundhofer, formerly Wells Fargo's top Los Angeles executive. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr's job at Columbia, which he joined in September, 1988, included monitoring 
credit problems in the troubled junk bond portfolio. He was also one of six 
executives who, along with former CEO Thomas Spiegel, once ran the thrift in a 
partner-like manner. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's portfolio of high-yield junk bonds and preferred stock has plunged 
by more than $1 billion in value over the past year, rendering the thrift 
insolvent and putting it in danger of being seized by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Other top executive who have left Columbia or announced their resignations 
include Spiegel, former President Lawrence K. Fish, former Chief Financial 
Officer James A. D'Aquila and David A. Sachs, a Columbia executive vice 
president whose resignation is effective Friday. JAMES BATES

KEATING VOWS TO KEEP FIGHTING TO REGAIN S&amp;L;

<P>
THRIFTS: THE FORMER HEAD OF LINCOLN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN SAYS HE'S BROKE. HE 
INSISTS THAT REGULATORS WERE WRONG TO SEIZE HIS INSTITUTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
A combative Charles H. Keating Jr., symbol of the savings and loan debacle to 
many, said Wednesday that he is broke and may lose his house. But he vowed to 
keep fighting the government's charges of fraud and racketeering in the 
collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you like what I'm telling you or not, I'm telling the truth," Keating 
lectured a packed house at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
Keating attacked federal regulators for last year's seizure of Lincoln, which 
could cost taxpayers as much as $2.5 billion to clean up and is likely to 
become the biggest single failure among hundreds of S&amp;L casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that Lincoln was insolvent, a collapsed structure 
consisting of bad investments and phony bookkeeping, and has sued Keating and 
other executives for $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But Keating said that things were fine until the regulators stepped inside the 
doors of the Irvine-based institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's been lost at Lincoln; the assets haven't been sold," Keating said, 
arguing that the government should never have intervened. 
</P>
<P>
"We are broke," he said. "They took everything away from me when they took the 
Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
The financier said his only regret about the "Keating Five" -- the U.S. 
senators who intervened on his behalf with federal regulators -- is that they 
were ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
If federal officials had paid attention to the five senators' inquiries about 
allegedly overzealous regulation, "the federal taxpayer would be $500 billion 
better off," Keating said, referring to some estimates of the eventual cost of 
the entire S&amp;L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
The five senators "did darn well and should be congratulated, but no one 
listened to them," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators who have faced considerable criticism for their relationships 
with Keating, a big campaign donor, are Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), John 
Glenn (D-Ohio), Donald Riegle (D-Mich.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
Keating strongly denied assertions that he is a rich man, with millions of 
dollars hidden in foreign bank accounts or buried in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had $200 million, I must be the stupidest man in the world (because) none 
of it stuck to me or my kids," he said. "I don't have $200 million, I don't 
have $100,000, or $20,000." 
</P>
<P>
Keating launched into a litany of denials about a number of rumors that he said 
have circulated about him: 
</P>
<P>
* Involvement in the sale of arms to Iran. "I've never been to Iran," he said. 
"I don't know anybody from Iran." 
</P>
<P>
* Connections with deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega. "I never put 
a nickel in Panama. I never ran drugs. I never took drugs." 
</P>
<P>
* Building a lavish resort, the Phoenician, in Arizona solely to satisfy his 
vanity. "The hotel is enormously successful," he said, with gross income of $45 
million to $48 million in its first year of operations. 
</P>
<P>
* Creation of secret foreign bank accounts. "I never had a nickel overseas." 
</P>
<P>
Keating, the former chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent 
firm, said he could lose his Phoenix-area house as a result of Lincoln's 
failure. The company holding the mortgage has filed for foreclosure "because I 
haven't paid my mortgage in four or five months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said his legal bills and expenses are being paid with proceeds from 
liability insurance policies for officers and executives of American 
Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring himself defiant and unbowed despite a wave of government legal 
attacks, Congressional criticism and negative media exposure, Keating offered 
one note of apology. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dreadfully sorry," he said, for the 22,000 investors who bought $200 
million worth of bonds in American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds were sold at Lincoln branches, and many investors believed that they 
were buying certificates of deposits, insured by the federal government up to 
$100,000. The bonds became virtually worthless after American Continental filed 
for bankruptcy a day before federal regulators seized Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"I really am sorry," Keating repeated. "It's the biggest pain in my life . . . 
I'm sorry they had problems. I'm dreadfully sorry and everybody in my family 
is." 
</P>
<P>
But the bondholders "have an excellent chance to recover," Keating said, if he 
succeeds in legal efforts to overturn the government's seizure of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Keating spoke for 40 minutes and answered questions for 20 more, insisting 
again and again that the S&amp;L crisis was a creation of the government, which 
seized S&amp;Ls that he said should have been left alone to work out their 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"By what right does the government come in and take these institutions?" he 
asked, predicting that the cost to taxpayers will climb as more S&amp;Ls are 
seized. "You're geometrically multiplying billions, and the bill will get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators have said their responsibility is to protect individual 
account holders, whose deposits are guaranteed up to $100,000. A combination of 
falling real estate prices, bad investments and inept or crooked management 
have crippled S&amp;Ls, making government takeovers inevitable, according to 
the regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said he will keep battling the government to achieve ultimate 
vindication. "I'm not afraid of the future, and my family isn't," he said.

ORIOLES EMBARRASS LANGSTON; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: ANGEL PITCHER IS FRUSTRATED AFTER GIVING UP EIGHT WALKS AND FOUR RUNS 
IN BALTIMORE'S 9-1 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Few teams have walked all over Mark Langston as the Baltimore Orioles did 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
On a night when a victory by their prized left-hander might have given the 
Angels hope of reversing the skid that threatens to take them out of the 
American League West pennant race, the Angels instead reverted to the dismal 
form that has characterized their struggles during the first month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston matched a career high by issuing eight walks over six innings to the 
Orioles, who put together two walks and four singles in the fifth for the 
foundation of a 9-1 rout at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was a defeat Langston took hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm embarrassed, totally embarrassed that it happened," Langston (2-3) said 
after the league's weakest-hitting team produced four runs against him on seven 
hits, all singles. The Orioles didn't manage an extra-base hit until Bill 
Ripken lined a two-run double off Mark Clear, and totaled only two. The second 
was a two-run home run in the ninth by Cal Ripken, who joined Ernie Banks and 
Vern Stephens as the only players to hit 200 home runs as a major league 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overthrowing the ball, rushing," Langston said. "It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' sixth defeat in seven games and 16th in their last 21 left them 10 
1/2 games behind the first-place Oakland Athletics, the Angels' first 
double-digit deficit of the season. Worse, it obscured the memory of Chuck 
Finley's exemplary three-hit shutout of the Orioles on Tuesday, which the 
Angels had hoped might lift them out of their funk. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they slid back. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're not in the situation we want," Langston said of the 
sixth-place Angels. "Chuck did such a great job (Tuesday) and I wanted to keep 
the ball moving. I let the team down, and that's very frustrating for myself." 
</P>
<P>
So bad did Langston deem his performance that he wondered why Oriole Manager 
Frank Robinson asked home plate umpire Larry McCoy to check the ball and his 
cap for pine tar in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Beats me why he bothered," Langston said. "I probably should have used it." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles seem to profit more by taking pitches, as shown by a league-low 
.229 batting average and a league-leading 134 walks. Langston said he felt "as 
strong as I've felt this year," but that abundance of strength didn't translate 
into the fearsome fastball and delicate control that allowed him to command $16 
million in the free-agent market last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Langston struggled from the outset but helped his cause by starting a pickoff 
in the first and was aided by Lance Parrish's throw on Phil Bradley's stolen 
base attempt in the third. He was flailing by the fifth, in which the key hits 
were Randy Milligan's two-run single and two-out RBIs by Dave Segui and Bob 
Melvin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's just trying to do too much right now," pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann said. "It's a thing guys fall into once in a while. Bases on ball 
don't make it easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more a matter of getting to the point where he's relaxing than mechanics 
and things like that. Right now, it's a matter of him not trying to do too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels couldn't do much at all against Oriole starter Pete Harnisch (3-0), 
although Harnisch owed much credit for the complete-game victory to his 
outfielders. Parrish was robbed three times, once to each field, and Dante 
Bichette's long fly ball to center with two on in the sixth was snared by Mike 
Devereaux to preserve a shutout, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
The only Angel run came in the seventh, on a double by Mark McLemore and a 
single by Luis Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chili Davis, who was one for four: "We get hits, but we're not getting key 
hits. It's tough to elaborate on things because there's going to be a lot of 
negative things, and I don't want to dwell on those. 
</P>
<P>
"This team will get hot. It's frustrating for the front office and the fans, 
but more frustrating for us because we aren't coming together as a team. But 
it's going to happen. We have to bear down and try hard and not try to do too 
much. We each have to do our individual job." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Reese, who suffered a mild heart attack last week, was released from St. 
John's Hospital in Santa Monica and is resting at home. The 85-year-old 
conditioning coach is not expected back in uniform until after the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield is scheduled to undergo another Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging test today at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood to 
determine how his strained hamstring is healing. Schofield was injured during 
spring training and has yet to play this season. Reliever Bob McClure, on the 
disabled list because of a sore left elbow, threw for 15 minutes Wednesday -- 
including six minutes off the mound -- and reported no discomfort. He will 
continue to throw if no problems arise today. 
</P>
<P>
Several Anaheim Stadium employees said they had heard Wednesday that Brian 
Downing had retired and was to be paid $500,000 by the team. In truth, the 
retiree was pitcher Mike Smithson, who was released by the Angels the weekend 
before the season opened.

BUCK STOPS WITH LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
NBA PLAYOFFS: THEY TAKE BLAME FOR FOURTH-QUARTER BREAKDOWN, DURING WHICH THEY 
MADE FOUR OF 19 SHOTS.

<P>
A short jump shot by Laker forward James Worthy late in the third quarter 
Tuesday night looked as if it would fall short. But rather than passively 
following the ball's flight, Worthy all but scared it into the basket with his 
deep, threatening voice. 
</P>
<P>
"Get in there," Worthy grumbled. The ball obliged. 
</P>
<P>
But all the coaxing by Worthy could not prevent a surprising fourth-quarter 
offensive collapse that led to a 104-102 loss to the Phoenix Suns in Game 1 of 
the NBA Western Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers went the final 3 minutes 40 seconds without making a basket. They 
made only four of 19 shots in the fourth quarter, blowing an eight-point lead 
in the last nine minutes. Worthy missed all of his six shots in the fourth 
quarter, Magic Johnson made only one of five shots and Byron Scott missed his 
only shot in the final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The unraveling was neither pretty nor common. The Suns' defense, which included 
Kurt Rambis on Worthy and Dan Majerle or Jeff Hornacek on Johnson, was only 
partly responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers blamed themselves. They said they lacked patience, had lapses of 
composure and simply took the first, instead of the best, shot they had. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the Lakers gathered at the Forum to review their inadequacies on 
videotape in hopes of avoiding another collapse against the Suns tonight in 
Game 2. "We watched (the fourth quarter) over and over and over again," forward 
Orlando Woolridge said. "I think we learned from that. That's not like us. We 
have such good players that sometimes we feel we don't have to execute." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the Lakers have folded in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In finishing with an NBA-best 63 regular-season victories, the Lakers had to 
come from behind on numerous occasions. But they had a memorable home-court 
collapse against the Detroit Pistons, failing to score a basket for the final 
eight minutes and getting shut out in overtime. And they lost Game 3 of the 
series against the Houston Rockets after making five of 18 fourth-quarter 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the great teams, it happens to them sometimes," Sun Coach Cotton 
Fitzsimmons said. "I'm not going to say either way, whether it was us or them. 
But how many times is James going to go 0 for six and Magic one for five? 
That's not going to happen a lot. We're not bragging about it. We're just 
playing. But we do believe in ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley watched in seeming disbelief Tuesday night. He emerged 
Wednesday in a feisty mood. 
</P>
<P>
"Four out of 19 is not going to beat anybody," Riley said. "You can't make 
assumptions that, because you are at home, good things are going to happen. Our 
failure to execute and be patient got (the Suns) even. What happens is you get 
a little frustrated and you lose the discipline. We knew what we had to do. We 
worked on it for three days in practice. We did not do it. 
</P>
<P>
"(Laker players) should be upset with themselves. We had an eight-point lead 
and some nice moments and chances to really open up a lead in the third 
quarter. We could've had a 13-, 15-point lead had we made a couple proper 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"They should be disappointed in themselves in how they executed and their 
impatience on offense in the last eight minutes of game." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said the Lakers held a "nice film session" to hash out their problems. If 
Laker players were not aware of their fourth-quarter transgressions before, 
Riley kept hitting the rewind button. 
</P>
<P>
In the final 8:11, the Lakers committed three turnovers and had a curious 
selection of shots. Worthy had an inside shot blocked by Tom Chambers, Magic 
Johnson an inside shot blocked by Eddie Johnson. Scott missed an open 
three-point shot, Woolridge missed a jump shot from the top of the key, Worthy 
missed two jump shots under pressure and another while crossing the lane with 
1:01 to play. Worthy also was pressured into taking an off-balance running jump 
shot with five seconds left that was not close. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute," Worthy said. "We were quick-shooting everything. We've got 
to play 48 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
What may have been most troublesome -- and surprising -- to the Lakers was 
their lack of patience when the Suns rallied. 
</P>
<P>
"We played like a first-year playoff team," center Mychal Thompson said. "It 
wasn't us out there. We've got to play with intelligence in the fourth quarter. 
We rushed the offense and got too anxious. Is that the Lakers?" 
</P>
<P>
It certainly was the same Phoenix defense the Lakers have faced so often, but 
they could not handle the Suns' constant pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons had used Chambers almost exclusively against Worthy the last two 
seasons. In Game 1, however, the more-physical Rambis guarded Worthy until late 
in the fourth quarter, when Chambers took over. Worthy led the Lakers with 22 
points, but made only nine of 26 shots. Neither Rambis, the former Laker, nor 
Fitzsimmons wanted credit for controlling Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rambis: "I guarded him just like everybody else would -- try to push him 
as far away from the post as possible and then scream for help. It's really not 
Worthy against Rambis. It's Worthy against the Phoenix Suns." 
</P>
<P>
Added Fitzsimmons, who watched Worthy average a Laker-high 25 points against 
the Suns in last season's playoff series: "I think Kurt did a nice job on him, 
played him hard. . . . Kurt is a thinker, very defensive-minded. If you're 
going to play a guy like Worthy, you've got to be a thinker. Kurt knows Worthy, 
what he likes to do best. That doesn't mean he's going to stop him, but it can 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he hopes the Suns use Rambis, who is slower but stronger than 
Chambers, on Worthy tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying Kurt is not an excellent post defensive player -- he is -- but 
I think James has quickness and can do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
Hornacek and Majerle, among others, took shifts in applying the tight defense 
that kept the ball away from Magic Johnson, who made four of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"(Phoenix's defense is) not any tougher than Houston's or 82 other games this 
year," Riley said. "Earvin's used to it. He knows it. He knows what he has to 
do. Last night, I thought it was a relief, I really do. They didn't come and 
trap him and double-team him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "They are trying to wear me down, like most teams do. I just have 
to get into it more." 
</P>
<P>
Distraught as Riley was about the Lakers' offensive problems, the coach said he 
was reasonably pleased with his team's defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers concentrated on controlling point guard Kevin Johnson (nine points, 
12 assists) and shooters Eddie Johnson (four of 12) and Chambers (10 of 26) at 
the expense of center Mark West. 
</P>
<P>
West, occasionally left unguarded when Laker big men double-teamed players with 
the ball, made the Lakers pay. He scored 24 points, had 16 rebounds and blocked 
seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not an aberration," Riley said of West. "You've got to give (West) 
credit. He was definitely a difference. I thought for the most part we defended 
efficiently enough to win. But our offense put a lot of pressure on our 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cotton wore cotton, and the Suns finally ended two long Forum losing streaks 
Tuesday night. So, Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said he again plans to wear the 
cotton-knit golf shirt he borrowed from trainer Joe Proski after he left his 
white dress shirt at the team's hotel Tuesday night. The Suns had lost 21 
consecutive games in the Forum, and Fitzsimmons, who had lost 37 in a row 
there, gave partial credit to Proski's golf shirt. "I think it's the shirt," 
Fitzsimmons said after Tuesday's game. "I may keep this shirt forever." 
</P>
<P>
Sun point guard Kevin Johnson, who attempted only seven shots in 45 minutes, is 
playing with a hip pointer and did not appear to make have his usual quick 
bursts toward the basket. "It's affecting him," Fitzsimmons said, "but you do 
what you have to do. But let's give Byron Scott credit. Scott did a great job 
on him." Johnson said his hip is not hampering his play. "That's Cotton just 
trying to protect a player," Johnson said. "I'm smart enough to know what it 
takes to win. The other players were doing it (Tuesday). It's important to us 
to have everyone involved." . . . Fitzsimmons segued into his thickest, 
down-home style when asked what he expects from the Lakers tonight. "I expect 
the Lakers to come back with fire in their nostrils," he said, "coming at us as 
strong as a freight train can come at you. There'll be no surprises with the 
Lakers, I tell you that."

JIM MURRAY: NO MASK, HE WEARS A SMILE

<TEXT>
<P>
When Floyd Patterson lost the heavyweight championship by knockout to Sonny 
Liston, he felt such mortification and disgrace, he donned a false beard and 
mustache and dark glasses -- at night -- and sped out of town to go home to the 
Hudson Valley and presumably climb up a tree and huddle there in misery. He 
felt he let the country down. 
</P>
<P>
When Joe Louis lost by knockout to the flower of Nazi Germany, Max Schmeling, 
in 1936, the height of Hitler's reign, he felt he let the world down and only 
emerged, days later, to pose with swollen jaw for a photo pointing to his "KO" 
license plate and vowing vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
When Jim Jeffries lost by knockout to Jack Johnson in 1910 and there were riots 
in the cities, he felt he let the white race down and he retreated to his 
Burbank farm to lick his wounds and avoid the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But if anyone is expecting a somber, chastened, contrite Mike Tyson to be 
hiding from the public as a result of his knockout at the hands of Buster 
Douglas last February, boy, have you got the wrong guy! 
</P>
<P>
If you were expecting sackcloth and ashes, a hairshirt, a monastic attitude or 
a penitent pulling at his forelock, you were in for a shock. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson showed up in town Wednesday wearing a pair of designer bib overalls, 
a gold-toothed smile and the jaunty attitude of a guy who just won a lottery. 
</P>
<P>
He just lost the heavyweight championship of the world?! Pfui! He'll get it 
back. 
</P>
<P>
He just got publicly humiliated in the ring by a guy who didn't figure to warm 
him up? Oh well, these things happen. 
</P>
<P>
No false whiskers and smoked glasses for Iron Mike. Sing no sad songs for Mr. 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
It was just a knockout. Mike laughs when he talks about it. No big deal. Just a 
little accident. Happens in the best of families. Sort of like slipping on a 
roller skate at the top of the stairs. Just carelessness, not catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
Mike even admits he watches the debacle on tape. He jokes about that, too: "I 
sit there and I tell myself, 'Hey, man! Duck!' But on screen, I don't duck. I 
scream, 'Duck, you dummy!' But the dummy don't listen to me." 
</P>
<P>
It was probably the most shocking upset in the history of pugilism. Schmeling's 
knockout of Joe Louis and Jim Corbett's KO of John L. Sullivan are the only 
ones that come close. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Tyson is not apologizing to anybody. He is not ready for a monastery 
yet. One reporter wanted to know if it made him suicidal. Mike thought that was 
hilarious, saying: "Hey! I got lots of money to spend before I kill myself!" 
</P>
<P>
Mike is even baffled as to why anyone should think he would be ready for a 
rubber room. Hey! It's just a fight! 
</P>
<P>
"You have to deal with things like this every day," he says. "Did I cry? I wish 
I could cry! The last time I cried was when I got my divorce. That's when you 
cry. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, can I tell you something? It was a relief, is what it was. It was 
relief of a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
It is the concerted belief of the fight mob that the worst damage of a knockout 
is to the brain. The medical profession would certainly agree, but the fight 
mob doesn't mean pathological, it means psychological. "It gets a fighter 
thinking to lose," the old-time manager, Willie Ketchum, once explained. 
"Fighters are pessimists." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson isn't pessimistic, just realistic: "He fought a good fight, I fought a 
bad fight. I got to deal with that. I'm not the type guy to get down on 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, if I was, like, half the fighter I am and I lost the title to 
someone, and I knew I could never beat this guy, that might, you know, tend to 
dishearten me. But this is something you know isn't going to last forever." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's position is, the title is just on temporary loan. Does he feel Douglas 
has his number, will be able to repeat? Tyson looks amused. "You don't see him 
rushing to sign a rematch, do you?" he challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does the notion of vengeance consume Tyson. He doesn't have a picture 
of Douglas pasted up on his room wall. He doesn't brood, spend every waking 
hour plotting to get even. "You deal with it!" he protests. "Hey! These things 
happen. When I was running the streets, I used to have worse things happen. And 
that was where you knew what you were doing was wrong to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson says his frame of mind will be "perfect" when he climbs into the ring on 
June 16 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to fight Henry Tillman, the heavyweight 
who twice beat him -- in three-rounders -- for the right to represent the 
United States in the Olympics. It is to be his "comeback" -- if a man 23 years 
old can be said to need a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to it," Tyson says with a smile. "I didn't have enough 
respect for the title. I kind of took it for granted. I won't do that again." 
</P>
<P>
For Tyson, defeat is no agony, just an annoyance. His attitude is reminiscent 
of Joe Louis, who lay on the rubbing table the night he was knocked out by 
Rocky Marciano, then looked up to see a whole locker room full of sobbing, 
weeping people. Joe was irritated. "Hey!" he protested. "I knocked out lots of 
guys!" 
</P>
<P>
So has Mike Tyson. And, to hear him tell it, will again. Save your tears.

BAN FROM OLYMPICS TURNS INTO NET LOSS;

<P>
TENNIS: SOUTH AFRICAN PLAYERS HADN'T BEEN HURT BY MOST WORLD SANCTIONS UNTIL 
IOC RULING.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Diepraam was 20 years old in 1964 when he competed in his first Davis Cup 
tennis match. Norway was playing host to South Africa. There had been some 
trouble with anti-apartheid protesters before the South African team arrived, 
but no one had any idea the situation would get so out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
The security around the competition site was massive, but so was the group of 
anti-South African protesters. Spectators had to walk through a hail of 
leaflets to get into the stadium. It didn't stop inside -- the protesters had 
bought tickets, too. 
</P>
<P>
Diepraam was warming up for his match on center court when he heard a whistle. 
Suddenly, there was a rush of people around him. In moments, anti-apartheid 
activists were sitting all over the tennis court, forming a sea of protesters 
through which Diepraam and his Norwegian opponent appeared to be be wading. 
</P>
<P>
Diepraam still has a news photograph taken at the time. In it, he is looking at 
all the people and laughing, with a slightly bewildered look. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six years later, tennis officials in South Africa are still bewildered, 
but they are no longer laughing. Some believe they have been betrayed by their 
international federation, abandoned by professional tennis players and 
manipulated by sports administrators with an agenda heavy on politics and 
personal ambition. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis in South Africa is an interesting study of the before and after of 
international sanctions. While other sports, primarily those in the Olympic 
Games, faced elaborate bans and boycotts, South African tennis players at one 
time were free to travel the world to compete. And although there were some 
protests, they were mainly restricted to Davis Cup competition, in which 
players represented their countries. 
</P>
<P>
So, in a nation of sports isolation, South African tennis and its professional 
players happily globetrotted while other athletes stayed home. In fact, given 
South Africa's mild climate, tennis thrived. South Africa has produced such 
stars as Frew McMillan, Bob Hewitt, Ray Moore, Kevin Curren, Johan Kriek, Cliff 
Drysdale, Ros Fairbank and Christo van Rensburg. 
</P>
<P>
That was the before. The after began last January, when the International 
Olympic Committee ruled that any tennis player who played in South Africa would 
not be eligible to compete in the Olympics. Tennis became a medal sport in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling has forced many of the world's tennis players to make a difficult 
decision. South African tennis tournaments have not only tradition and 
hospitality but also very competitive purses. Also, in the past, the South 
African Grand Prix tournaments were important to players because they award 
points that go toward determining who will play in the men's year-ending 
Masters tournament, in which only the top eight singles players in the world 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
American Brad Gilbert came under fire in 1987 for playing in a tournament at 
Johannesburg two weeks before the Masters, to earn enough points to qualify for 
the latter event. American Tim Mayotte was battling Gilbert for the eighth and 
final spot but chose not to play in South Africa. And because of previous 
commitments, Mayotte could not play in another tournament the next week, the 
last week to earn points, thereby failing to qualify for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
These very different decisions were subjected to intense scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Mayotte chose not to play in South Africa because he had already drawn the ire 
of anti-apartheid groups when he played there several years previously. For 
that, Mayotte had been placed on a United Nations blacklist, but he was not 
alone. Some of tennis' brightest stars have at some point been on it, including 
Chris Evert and Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert argued that his decision to play in South Africa had nothing to do with 
politics, but everything to do with his job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a tennis player and not a politician," he said in an interview in New York 
in 1987. "I don't think sports and politics should be mixed. I went to 
Johannesburg because I needed points to qualify for the Masters. I'd have gone 
to the moon to get here. If I hadn't gone to Johannesburg, I'd be sitting on 
the sidelines now." 
</P>
<P>
South African tennis did not have a good year in 1989. First, the revamped 
Assn. of Tennis Professionals, the men's pro tour now run by the players, 
scheduled two stops in South Africa for the following year. Then the ATP 
canceled the tournaments for "moral and practical reasons," according to ATP 
President Vijay Amritraj. 
</P>
<P>
The ATP's player council was widely criticized for scheduling the events and in 
August held a five-hour discussion on the subject. Leading the group arguing to 
remove the tournaments from the 1990 schedule was former Wimbledon champion 
Arthur Ashe. 
</P>
<P>
After the decision to pull out, Amritraj said: "For the last six or eight 
months, we had this question asked of us everywhere, all around the world. It 
overshadowed everything we had done with the tour. These two events were 
canceled for the good of the tour. The Olympics are a major factor, so is the 
United Nations boycott, and the fact that South Africa is not a respected 
member of the world sports community." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, satellite events in South Africa, lesser tournaments for which 
players receive points in the ATP rankings, continue. 
</P>
<P>
About a month after the ATP decision, the International Tennis Federation 
suspended South Africa as an associate member until the country dismantles 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
When tennis joined the Olympic family, it also got its rules. Ray Moore, a 
former touring pro from South Africa and a former chairman of the Men's 
International Professional Tennis Council, said the day tennis entered the 
Olympics was the day South African tennis was dealt a deadly blow. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of negative things that have come down on our heads directly 
because of tennis getting into the Olympics," Moore said. He lives in Palm 
Springs and was back in South Africa for a brief meeting with the South African 
Tennis Union regarding a junior program he is coordinating. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly didn't need it. We were going along quite nicely. Yes, our 
players overseas were restricted from playing in some countries. They weren't 
happy about it, but they were grateful. They could play in half of Western 
Europe. They could compete in 50-60 tournaments a year. They could accept that. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been lucky in our sport. We've escaped the wrath of SANROC (South 
African Non Racial Olympic Committee, a London-based anti-apartheid lobby) and 
the other organizations that have tried to stop international sport in this 
country. Now, that's changed. Tennis is in the Olympics, and all of a sudden, 
professional tennis in this country comes under the microscope of the Olympic 
Charter. I have very, very strong views about that. I think it's steeped in 
hypocrisy. What the ITF has done is hypocritical in the extreme." 
</P>
<P>
Moore believes that ITF President Phillipe Chatrier worked with Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, to get tennis into 
the Games because Samaranch loves tennis. He had promised to help Chatrier 
become an IOC representative. So, the personal agenda of these two men changed 
tennis forever. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa was a founding member of the ITF in 1913 and has been in Davis Cup 
competition since its inception. Yet since apartheid was installed in South 
Africa in 1948, there has continually been some form of protest in the tennis 
community. The only time South Africa won the Davis Cup was in 1974, by 
default, the only default in the finals in the Cup's 90-year history. 
</P>
<P>
India refused to play South Africa in protest against apartheid. Four years 
later, South Africa voluntarily withdrew from Davis Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
American Davis Cup stalwart John McEnroe has been a consistently strong critic 
of apartheid, having once turned down $1 million to play an exhibition in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe also told Ashe, a former U.S. Davis Cup captain, that he would never 
play on a Davis Cup team with Curren or Kriek, both former South Africans who 
have U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Some countries are stepping up the pressure, too. Israel played India in the 
Davis Cup quarterfinals in 1987. In order to gain visas for India, Israeli 
players Amos Mansdorf and Shlomo Glickstein signed statements denouncing 
apartheid and pledging not to play in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Mansdorf competed in the South African Open and said he 
didn't feel in any way bound by the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign against South African tennis players has been stepped up recently. 
Sam Ramsamy, leader of SANROC, singled out South African tennis players as 
targets of a new campaign to isolate South Africa. Ramsamy said his group had 
worked out a "secret strategy" to do this. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy may be secret, but it certainly appears to be little more than a 
combination of increased vigilance and louder protests. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Open in January was an example of the intensified pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Officials permitted the Australian Anti-Apartheid Movement to hang banners on 
center court and distribute leaflets. South African players in the tournament 
were picketed. Trade unions threatened to disrupt the event. At least one South 
African, Van Rensburg, had to be escorted to and from his matches by a security 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
There was even some speculation that this year's Australian Open might have 
been the last for South African tennis players. The Australian government has a 
policy of barring teams representing South Africa, but admitting individuals. 
There is a good chance that the policy may be changed to exclude all South 
African athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"We must get them to tournaments; the way to improve at tennis is you must have 
competition," Moore said. "If you don't have competition, you will stagnate. A 
good example of that is Russia. In 1974, Russia decided they would no longer 
send their players on the international tennis tour because of South Africa's 
participation in international tennis events. 
</P>
<P>
"They stopped sending players. They continued to play (in the Soviet Union). 
They had money, they had facilities, they had trainers. And they produced 
nobody. They played in the Davis Cup only and they routinely lost in the first 
round. It was self-imposed isolation for 10 years. Then they changed their 
minds around 1984-85 and they decided to get back into international tennis. 
From that time forward, they have produced players." 
</P>
<P>
South African tennis officials speak about their sport as being non-racial. 
</P>
<P>
By this, they mean that SATU-affiliated tournaments may not bar non-whites from 
playing, as they did in the past. Tennis officials say the sport is popular 
among blacks, yet the expense of equipment and facilities puts the game 
financially out of reach for most black South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, South African tennis officials speak proudly of what the SATU 
has done to promote the sport among blacks. However, the gap between rhetoric 
and reality is vast. 
</P>
<P>
Soweto, the sprawling black township west of Johannesburg, has a population of 
2.5 million and a total of 16 tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
The Arthur Ashe Tennis Center is in the Shangoville section of Soweto. 
Construction began in 1978. Phase I is not finished. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, today the courts are abandoned, the nets are long since blown away, 
and what remain of the fences around the courts hang and droop like shrugged 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
A few children play near the courts but not on them. One boy sits high in a 
wooden umpire's chair, seeming to enjoy the view. 
</P>
<P>
But in tennis terms, there's not much to see. Despite SATU officials' claims 
that they pour millions of rands into township tennis programs, there is little 
evidence of their expenditure. Johannesburg's largest townships, Soweto and 
Alexandra, have tennis courts, but all are in disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell us that blacks cannot play tennis, that we do not know how," said 
Kapi Tkwana, who is on a youth sports committee in Alexandra. He waved a hand 
at a cracked and peeling court. "Not even Boris Becker could play tennis on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's frustrations pour out. Politics, money, delicate negotiations and 
coping with sanctions take their toll. 
</P>
<P>
He says the time has come to lift sanctions and reduce the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you have a naughty child," he said. "You have a naughty child and 
you spank him and you spank him and you spank him. Finally, there comes a time 
when you must stop spanking the child, otherwise you are going to end up with a 
monster. We are in that situation now. You guys have been spanking us and 
spanking us. When are you going to give us a little encouragement? We've done 
everything possible in tennis. We fly in the face of government opinion. We've 
come out publicly against apartheid. What more is there for us to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of non-white tennis here say there's plenty to be done, beginning 
with providing facilities in the townships, not busing black children to tennis 
courts in white areas. 
</P>
<P>
They also say all foreign tennis players should stay out of South Africa until 
apartheid is gone. The influx of professional players at tournaments in white 
areas only further segregates the sport, they say. 
</P>
<P>
All sides agree on one thing: There is little that is fair about the current 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa violates human rights, let's accept that," Moore said. "I'm not 
proud of it. It's a fact of life. But if you go to Amnesty International, which 
I have done, and you'll see they have an A category and a B and a C category, 
and South Africa is not in the A category of the worst violators of human 
rights. But in the A category, you are going to find many, many countries that 
are respected members of the IOC and that play Davis Cup -- Iran, Syria, Libya 
to start with. These are known terrorist countries. They blow airliners out of 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran is playing in Davis Cup this year. They will be in the Olympics. The U.S. 
will send an American Davis Cup team and an American Olympic team to play in 
those two competitions, and you still say, 'South Africa, pariah nation, no 
way, terrible country, you can't play with them.' How can you do that?"

Quick, somebody, wake up the Lakers before the Suns set on their season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's defeat by Phoenix was no fluke. The defending NBA runners-up 
have played only one outstanding game in the playoffs. That was Game 4 in 
Houston. Otherwise, their performances have ranged from lousy to fair. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'm still waiting for Magic Johnson to take over the flow of a game as only he 
can. . . . 
</P>

GUNDS GET NHL TEAM IN BAY AREA

The San Francisco Bay Area got an NHL franchise, and the Minnesota North Stars 
got new owners in a deal approved Wednesday by the league's Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Baldwin, former chairman of the Hartford Whalers, and Morris Belzberg, a 
retired Budget Rent-A-Car executive, acquired the North Stars from Gordon and 
George Gund for about $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, the Gunds were given a Bay Area franchise for 1991-92 -- the league's 
first expansion since four teams from the World Hockey Assn. were admitted in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NHL said it might expand by one or two more teams for the 
1992-93 season. The league, which said last December that it plans to increase 
from 21 to 28 teams by the end of the decade but did not intend to add any 
teams until 1992, set a price tag of $50 million per franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The Gunds owned the North Stars since merging them with their Cleveland Barons 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The new team will play in the Cow Palace near San Francisco in 1991-92 before 
moving to a new arena in San Jose the next season. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first Bay Area hockey team since the California Seals -- owned 
partly by the Gunds -- left Oakland for Cleveland in 1976. The Seals were part 
of the league's first expansion in 1967, when six teams, including the North 
Stars, joined the original six clubs to double the NHL's size. 
</P>
<P>
Citing $16 million in losses over the past three years and lack of support from 
the Twin Cities, the Gunds announced on Jan. 30 that they would ask the NHL for 
permission to move to the Bay area unless they could get $15 million in 
improvements to the Met Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Gunds were denied the improvements in February.

Martina Navratilova, hobbled by a hamstring injury, and Jennifer Capriati each 
fought off challenges from unseeded opponents Wednesday to advance to the third 
round of the Italian Open in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova defeated Australia's Rachel McQuillan, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2, and 
14-year-old Capriati outlasted Susan Sloane, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Navratilova, wearing a bandage around her left thigh, showed 
little movement over the red clay of the Foro Italico. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing it day by day," she said. "I can't go 100%. I'm playing at about 
three-quarter speed." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, who turned pro in March and is seeded 12th, had beaten Sloane, 6-4, 
6-1, at Hilton Head, S.C., last month in her third pro tournament. In another 
match, third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain Kristin Godridge of 
Australia, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union faces a fine after failing to show for his 
match at the $1-million German Open at Hamburg, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov, seeded eighth, was scheduled to face West German Udo Riglewski in a 
second-round match, and officials replaced him with Lars Jonsson of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Jimmy Arias of the United States beat Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland, 
6-4, 2-6, 6-2, and Henri Leconte of France downed Jordi Arrese of Spain, 6-4, 
1-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded David Wheaton avoided becoming the fifth seeded player to lose in 
the U.S. Clay Court championships at Kiawah Island, S.C., rallying to beat 
qualifier Craig Campbell, 1-6, 6-3, 7-5.

BRUINS SWEEP PAST CAPITALS AND INTO FINALS, 3-2

Andy Moog and the Boston Bruin defense put the finishing touches on a four-game 
sweep of the Washington Capitals Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins limited Washington to 14 shots at Moog, including only three in the 
third period, as Boston advanced to the Stanley Cup finals for the second time 
in three years with a 3-2 victory, completing a sweep of the Wales Conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense was great and Moog was virtually flawless," Boston Coach Mike 
Milbury said. "Washington didn't get any second or third chances." 
</P>
<P>
"They were the better team," Washington Coach Terry Murray said. "I wish we had 
played the way we did in the first two series, but there was no question that 
they were better." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, whose last postseason sweep occurred in 1979, will face the 
Campbell Conference champion, either Edmonton or Chicago, in the finals. It 
will be the Bruins' 17th trip to the championship round. Their last appearance 
was in 1988, when they were swept by the Oilers. They won the last of their 
five Stanley Cups in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
After accepting the Prince of Wales Trophy, Boston captain Ray Bourque promised 
this year would be different from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a better club this time," Bourque said. "We've got a lot more speed, 
a great defense, and we're playing with a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Boston took a 1-0 lead on John Carter's goal 53 seconds into the game, made it 
2-0 on Cam Neely's power-play goal late in the period, then turned things over 
to Moog and a defense that ended up allowing Washington three goals over the 
final 202 minutes of the series. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the team to beat," said Washington's Nick Kypreos after the Capitals, 
making their first appearance in the Stanley Cup semifinals, were swept for the 
first time in 13 playoff series.

FEW RESTRICTIONS AGAINST THEM; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: GOLFERS CAN PLAY ALMOST ANYWHERE THEY PLEASE, BOXING GOES ON AND 
FORMULA ONE AUTO RACING MIGHT RESUME SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Golf in South Africa is still enjoying the privileges tennis used to have. And 
there is no sign that this will change. 
</P>
<P>
South African nationals such as Gary Player, Mark McNulty, Fulton Allem and 
David Frost come and go as they please. International players play on South 
Africa's thriving Sunshine circuit, which runs during South Africa's winter -- 
the Northern Hemisphere's summer. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, there are no restrictions on golfers. But there are 
exceptions. In 1988, the Spanish government banned all South Africans from 
competing in sports events in that country, sending the Spanish Open into 
controversy when the tournament director refused to bar six South African 
golfers. New Zealand, Canada and most of Asia and Africa have similar policies. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden's prohibition is more broad -- the country denies a visa to any athlete 
who has competed in South Africa. Sweden's two tour stops are minus several 
dozen players because of this. 
</P>
<P>
Many players don't mind the restrictions and say they will never give up the 
South African tour. 
</P>
<P>
Mark James, a European Ryder Cup player from Great Britain, is a longtime 
player on the Sunshine circuit. He played in the Protea Assurance South Africa 
Open in Cape Town in January and had no apologies for being there. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I'm no politician," James said. "I'm a golfer and I go where I 
can play golf in civilized conditions. And despite what views people have of 
South Africa, it is a civilized country both on the golf course and off it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming to South Africa during our winters for the past eight or nine 
years and I find it prepares me for the tough European tour. I can relax in the 
winter sun of South Africa, and unless I'm formally ordered not to tour, I will 
continue to spend my winters here." 
</P>
<P>
There are only a few sports left where international sanctions don't exist. 
Boxing is one, auto racing another. 
</P>
<P>
Professional boxers may compete anywhere they please and frequently fight in 
South Africa or Sun City, a nominally independent area. Not all choose to do 
so, however. Lloyd Honeyghan relinquished his World Boxing Assn. welterweight 
title in 1987 rather than fight South African Harold Volbrecht. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five international governing bodies for professional boxing, the World 
Boxing Council is the only one with an official policy toward South Africa. The 
WBC will not sanction South African fighters, and any WBC boxer who fights in 
South Africa will be dropped from the WBC rankings, never to be ranked again. 
</P>
<P>
The WBC even extends its policy to non-active boxers: In 1988, the WBC voted to 
censure former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta because he visited South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
South African heavyweight Gerrie Coetzee, a former WBA champion, sidestepped 
much potential criticism during his career by condemning apartheid early on. 
Coetzee, who is white, frequently fought black boxers and hated the 
color-conscious reference of "Great White Hope." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be the people's champ," Coetzee told Sports Illustrated in 1984. "I 
want to get rid of this rubbish of black champion, white champion. We're all 
human, praying to the same Lord, going to the same place if we are good." 
</P>
<P>
Auto racing has only one place to go in South Africa, the Kyalami race track, 
which has been on the Formula One circuit. In fact, Kyalami is the only 
licensed motor racing circuit in Africa and has been refurbished this year to 
conform to Formula One safety standards. Kyalami has not staged a Grand Prix 
since 1985, because of safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
If it reopens, Kyalami might stage its future Grand Prix with neighboring 
countries, so it might be called an African, not South African, event. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the world political context, the feeling of a new era of reform in 
South Africa will make it easier for our application to be considered," the 
track manager said.

Katarina Witt, East Germany's retired Olympic figure skating star, says that 
she passed up the chance to earn millions from Western sponsors by refusing to 
work for the Communist Stasi secret police. She added, "To be honest, I later 
many times regretted it." 
</P>
<P>
Witt, writing in the latest issue of the West German magazine Stern, said she 
had received offers from abroad worth a total of $3.1 million between 1984 and 
1988 to advertise Western products. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Olympic champion said the offers went to East German sports 
officials, who refused to give her permission to sign the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Witt said she later received two visits from Stasi agents who told her she 
could accept the sponsors' offers if she agreed to work for the secret police.

Eight professional football players filed suit against the NFL and its teams, 
charging that the creation of developmental squads amounts to price fixing. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that the league and its clubs last year illegally agreed to 
establish a six-person developmental squad for each team and pay those players 
$1,000 per week over the 16-week season. The suit contends the players could 
have made much more on injured reserve.

BREAKFAST CLUB: Every year at this time the city of Santa Ana invites 1,500 
employees to a free, outdoor feed -- called "The Great American Breakfast" -- 
where supervisors and managers flip pancakes, grill sausage and serve fresh 
strawberries, orange juice and coffee. . . . A more recent tradition began last 
year when some of the homeless who sleep out near City Hall joined in the food 
lines and were fed, and some employees are quietly encouraging them to show up 
again this morning. Kristina Lindgren and David Reyes

FUND DRIVE: Momentum is building at UC Irvine to create a $250,000 endowed 
professorship in Jewish history, long on UCI's wish list. . . . The county's 
Jewish community already has raised $190,000, with an ultimate goal of $500,000 
for a more prestigious endowed chair. One big gift -- $125,000 -- came from 
Orange County swap meet chieftain Robert Teller and his wife, Rita. History 
chair Michael Johnson wants a "really dynamic" professor for the post. Kristina

TOWER POWER: Building a tunnel beneath the Strait of Gibraltar (D5) is not 
Charles E. Kaempen's first dream. . . . In 1975, he suggested building a hollow 
plastic tower, 6,500 feet high and 325 feet wide. The idea: to disperse urban 
pollution in the upper atmosphere while producing water and generating 
electricity. Some experts said the concept was worth exploring, but it never 
got off the drawing board. Kristina Lindgren and David Reyes

STUDY DETAILS CHILD INJURIES IN TRUCK BEDS

Children who ride in the back of a pickup truck are often thrown from the 
vehicle and seriously injured, but California and most other states do not 
require that they be protected, pediatric researchers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"A kid traveling in the back of a pickup truck is an unguided missile," said 
Dr. Phyllis Agran, an associate professor of pediatrics at UC Irvine College of 
Medicine who has monitored children's injuries at local hospitals for more than 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Children are much more frequently ejected from pickups than adults, even in the 
absence of a collision, Agran said. Often they fall out when the truck 
accelerates, swerves or goes over a speed bump. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Anthony Woodword, an associate professor of pediatrics at the 
University of Utah School of Medicine, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
At a national conference of pediatricians Wednesday, he presented a study 
involving 40 children who were injured when they fell or were thrown from a 
pickup. "Thirty-eight percent of the injuries occurred in non-crash events," he 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that national sales of compact pickup trucks increased 300% from 1980 to 
1986, Woodword said legislators and the public need to recognize the danger and 
take steps to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
Agran noted that in California, dogs must be harnessed when riding in the back 
of a truck, but there is no legislation that directly addresses people riding 
in a truck bed. However, children under 4 must be restrained at all times in 
cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Woodword spoke at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers Hotel, where more than 3,000 
pediatricians from the American Pediatric Society, the Society for Pediatric 
Research and the Ambulatory Pediatric Assn. met for scientific discussions this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Agran attended the meetings but did not present her research here. However, 
co-researcher Diane Winn gave a report on the UCI project to the American 
Trauma Society in Washington last Thursday, and she and Agran described their 
results Wednesday in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI study covered children taken to 10 Orange County hospitals after falls 
out of trucks from 1980 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Of these, 201 children were injured while riding in the cab of the truck, 89 
while riding in the back, Winn said. Four of those children died after they 
were thrown from the truck bed in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that 24% of the children were injured when there was no crash; 
rather, they fell out when the pickup swerved, turned a corner or sped up. 
</P>
<P>
Enclosing the back of the truck does not ensure that children riding there 
won't be injured, she added; 25% of injuries involving children riding in back 
occurred in enclosed trucks -- sometimes when they were ejected from the back. 
</P>
<P>
Woodword reported similar results -- children "banging around in the back of 
the cab. Twenty-seven percent of our patients were injured like that -- five of 
those very seriously, with head injuries, internal injuries."

COUNCIL BUYS TIME IN MOBILE HOME FLAP 
</P>

<P>
Temporarily sidestepping the controversial issue of rent control for mobile 
home parks, the Laguna Beach City Council is supporting a one-year plan that 
would freeze rents for low-income senior citizens while allowing a 7% maximum 
rent increase for other park residents. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was initially proposed by the owners of Treasure Island Mobile Home 
Park, but the City Council voted unanimously to encourage the other two parks 
in the city to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
If the agreement can be reached before the June 5 council meeting, city 
officials will use the next year to develop a long-term plan for Laguna Beach's 
mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
During that year, the Planning Commission will consider specific mobile home 
park issues, such as whether mobile home owners should have the first 
opportunity to buy their parks if they go on the market and whether the city 
should have a relocation plan for residents if a park is sold. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight's issue is not an issue of rent control for me," Councilman Robert F. 
Gentry said Tuesday. "It's an issue of neighborhood preservation." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, said it is unreasonable for residents to expect special 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't afford where you're living, you should find a place where you can 
afford," said Laguna Beach resident Debra Wright. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of rent control for the 435 mobile home park spaces in Laguna Beach 
was raised largely as a result of a continuing dispute between Treasure Island 
Mobile Home Park and the park's new owners. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-acre oceanfront park was purchased for $40 million last August by 
Merrill Lynch Hubbard and Costa Mesa businessman Richard Hall, who expect to 
eventually close the park to make way for other development. Residents would 
like to someday buy the land and maintain it as a mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
If the interim measure approved Tuesday night is agreed upon, park owners who 
have no other tenant-lease agreement in place could then boost rents by 7%, 
excluding low-income seniors. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, the City Council extended a rent freeze placed on mobile home 
parks in December through June 5. If an agreement is not reached by then, the 
item will be back on the council agenda for discussion. LESLIE EARNEST

PATRON SHOT IN FACE IN BOTCHED ROBBERY

<P>
An armed robber held up a convenience store Wednesday, attempted to kidnap an 
employee and then shot a customer in the face before being arrested by police, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded customer, Douglas Bethel, 36, was treated and released from a local 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they could not provide details of the Westminster man's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the shooting inside the 7-Eleven store in the 6500 block of 
Westminster Boulevard, police arrested Manuel Lopez Calderon, 26, of 
Westminster on suspicion of attempted murder, robbery and attempted kidnaping. 
He is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Tom Pixler said the incident occurred around 1:45 a.m. when a robber 
entered the store and pointed a handgun at a cashier. 
</P>
<P>
"He forced the clerk to give him all the money" in the cash register, Pixler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pixler said a customer entered the store as the gunman was forcing the cashier 
into a back room. 
</P>
<P>
The store manager, who asked not to be named, said the robber then "pointed his 
gun at the customer and asked him for his money . . . but the customer thought 
it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then shot the customer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Clutching a grocery bag containing the money, police said, the man left the 
store and entered a Mercedes-Benz parked in front of the store. 
</P>
<P>
"He could not get it started," Pixler said. "So he took out a radio and a 
purse." 
</P>
<P>
As he stepped out of the car, the robber could not find the bag with the money 
and went back inside the store, according to police. By then police had been 
called and Calderon was taken into custody. DAVAN MAHARAJ

COUNTY OFFICE IN SOUTH MAY OPEN

<P>
Orange County supervisors will discuss next week establishing a special South 
County office that will offer an array of services, from answering questions 
about parcel maps to performing marriages, according to a report released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"As South County continues to grow, South County residents are finding it more 
difficult to travel to the Santa Ana Civic Center to conduct routine county 
business," says the report, which was written by officials in the county 
assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents are faced with increasing traffic congestion, long commute trips and 
limited public parking." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Thomas F. Riley, whose districts include South 
County, for months have lobbied to create better services in that area. 
Vasquez, who recently established constituent offices in Mission Viejo and 
Brea, said Wednesday he welcomes the report's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an indicator of things to come," Vasquez said. "The time has come 
for us to start decentralizing the services that we offer." 
</P>
<P>
The new South County office could open as soon as June and would give area 
residents easier access to county records, as well as walk-in service for 
questions regarding such things as parcel maps, tax assessment rolls and 
general information concerning building codes. 
</P>
<P>
It would cost the county $399,660 to establish the office and purchase 
furniture for it. After the first year, it would cost $138,600 to keep the 
lease on the 7,000-square-foot space, at 24422 Avenida de la Carlotta in Laguna 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its drier, more bureaucratic functions, the office would serve a 
more romantic one as well: It would be able to issue marriage licenses and even 
perform marriage ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing South County as I do, I'm sure there will be a demand for that 
service," Vasquez said. JIM NEWTON

HEIGHT OF FRANCISCAN PLAZA PLAN REJECTED

<P>
The developer of the controversial Franciscan Plaza in the city's historic 
downtown area will ask the City Council for help to avoid restrictions imposed 
this week by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Farber, developer of the Camino Capistrano project, said Wednesday he had 
filed an appeal with the council to overturn Tuesday night's decision by the 
commission. The commission voted 2 to 1 to approve the second phase of the 
project if Farber omits plans for a third floor and makes major modifications 
to the plaza's parking structure lighting. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't live with these restrictions," Farber said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Carolyn Nash called the project "too tall, too dense and too 
massive. It does not meet code and does not meet the general policies of our 
city's general plan." 
</P>
<P>
Phase two of the Franciscan Plaza proposes a restaurant, retail and office 
space on a half-acre parcel. Part of the project calls for the restoration of 
the 19th-Century Avila Adobe, which would become the restaurant. The first 
phase, which was completed in December, included a shopping plaza, five movie 
theaters and a multilevel parking structure at the corner of Camino Capistrano 
and Verdugo Street. 
</P>
<P>
Farber said he is frustrated with the commission over the height of the 
project. He asked for a variance on the city's 25-foot height limitations 
downtown. Phase two proposes an average height of 32 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working with the Planning Department for two and a half years on the 
third floor, because of the way the property descends toward the back," Farber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the project's height that bothered Commissioner Mary Jane Forster. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an absolutely beautiful project, but I can't support a third 
story," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Wyatt Hart voted to approve the project with the variance for the 
third floor. Commissioner Gil Jones abstained, and Commissioner Jim Erickson 
was absent.LEN HALL

CSUF WINS GRANT FOR FIBER OPTICS LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Science Foundation has awarded Cal State Fullerton $47,451 to 
equip a laboratory for undergraduate training and research in fiber optics and 
lasers. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first such project in California for undergraduate students, 
said Keith H. Wanser, an assistant professor of physics who sought the grant. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton is matching the foundation's grant, and an additional 
$30,000 is being sought from private industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The University of Southern California has a center like this for graduate 
students, but there is nothing like this for the undergraduate," Wanser said 
Wednesday. "It will give the students a . . . 20th-Century experience that will 
take them into the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
The major focus of study will be in high-speed communications and how to make 
fiber optic sensors. 
</P>
<P>
"Fiber optics is going to be a very dominant thing in the future," Wanser said. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing Fullerton's physics and engineering majors to work with the latest 
technology is essential, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of our graduates go straight into industry, and they need that 
lab experience with modern instrumention and equipment."

CITY MOVING TOWARD SPECIAL TAX DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mello-Roos districts, a development-financing tool commonly used in recent 
years in growing areas of eastern and southern Orange County, may soon be 
introduced to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday took initial steps to establish the city's first 
community facilities district, which would impose a higher, special property 
tax on 113 houses being built between Golden West and Edwards streets and 
Garfield and Ellis avenues. The extra tax revenue would pay for an array of 
street and utility improvements, as well as additional police and fire services 
for the area. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Monday adopted four resolutions stating its intent to establish 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
The city also tentatively plans to set up Mello-Roos districts to pay for 
similar facilities in the Holly-Seacliff and Bolsa Chica developments planned 
nearby, City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state's Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982, cities are 
allowed to levy a special property tax in addition to the 1% maximum tax 
allowed by Proposition 13, with the approval of voters in the targeted 
district. That enables cities to build roads, storm drains or other 
improvements in developing areas that they otherwise could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach's proposed Mello-Roos district, approved by the developer, 
would impose a 1.6% total property tax on each of the homes, which are 
scheduled to be completed within two years and will range in cost from $678,000 
to $843,000. Home buyers initially will pay an average of about $2,800 in 
property tax, a sum that would escalate each year to nearly twice that figure 
by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
The Mello-Roos tax revenues would pay for $3.5 million in improvements and 
expanded police and fire services, according to a city staff report. Ellis 
Avenue, now a ragged, two-lane farm road west of Golden West Street, would be 
widened and improved to accommodate more traffic and provide better storm 
drainage. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the council, which is scheduled to vote on the plan on June 
18, said they may reduce the amount of special tax being considered so it does 
not deter potential home buyers.JOHN PENNER

NEW PARENT GROUP ATTACKS SCHOOL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks after the Newport-Mesa Unified School District board voted to 
reopen Lincoln Elementary School for fourth, fifth and sixth grades only, more 
than 100 parents attended Tuesday night's board meeting to ask members to 
reconsider their decision. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for a newly formed group, Newport-Mesa Parents for Quality Education, 
Don Danks told the board that "full and open consideration" was lacking before 
the board acted on the issue on April 17. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, the board voted 4 to 3 to alter the grade configurations of 
schools in the Corona del Mar High School zone. Prompted by increasing 
enrollments at Andersen and Harbor View elementary schools, the board 
designated those two schools, as well as Eastbluff Kindergarten Center, for 
kindergarten through third grade, beginning in 1993. All area students that 
year will attend Lincoln for grades four through six. 
</P>
<P>
The parents have been objecting to the new plans because they like the 
continuity of kindergarten through sixth grade in neighborhood schools, and say 
that not enough research has gone into the proposal to group all the older 
elementary-school children onto one campus. 
</P>
<P>
Danks asked the board to begin the process of looking into possible 
alternatives for the three schools affected by the move. 
</P>
<P>
Danks was one of five people to speak to the board on the issue. Since the 
Lincoln reopening was not on the agenda, the board was restricted from 
responding to the comments under state law. Board President Judy Franco asked 
audience members to return for the May 22 board meeting, when staff members are 
scheduled to report on implementation plans to reopen Lincoln as the new middle 
school. Lincoln has been closed for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing frustration, parents gathered outside after the meeting and Danks 
indicated that Tuesday's attendance was necessary to demonstrate continued 
commitment to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to remain very calm and rational. . . . All we wanted to do is to let 
the school board know that there is a large contingent of parents concerned 
about this," Danks said, adding that the group hopes to draw a large crowd of 
supporters at the May 22 meeting. "We want to fill the room and have them 
coming out the doors." 
</P>
<P>
Danks said the parents group has raised about $20,000 in pledges, which will be 
used for parent education, direct mailings and other administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
The group is examining the possibility of legal action should the board refuse 
to reconsider its vote, Danks said. LAURA MICHAELIS

2 EJECT SAFELY BEFORE MARINE JET CRASHES IN OCEAN OFF SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Two crew members ejected safely from their Marine Corps photo reconnaissance 
jet Wednesday before it crashed off the San Diego coast during a routine 
training mission. 
</P>
<P>
The crash, which took place about 3:20 p.m., is under investigation, Master 
Sgt. Steven Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
The jet had taken off from El Toro earlier in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
One crew member was identified as Capt. T.P. Hewitt, a reconnaissance systems 
operator. The pilot's name was withheld pending notification of the next of 
kin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were picked up minutes after the crash by the tank landing ship 
Peoria, a Navy vessel that had been operating in the area, Merrill said. The 
men were flown by helicopter to the El Toro base for a precautionary medical 
examination, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, an RF-4B Phantom jet, is part of the air station's Marine Tactical 
Reconnaissance Squadron. It was purchased for $5 million, Merrill said. He 
wasn't sure how old the jet was, but the model was introduced in 1965, and the 
line is due to be replaced within a year.

17-YEAR-OLD BOY GUILTY OF 1ST-DEGREE MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: A HUNTINGTON BEACH YOUTH WHO SAID HE KILLED HIS ROOMMATE TO FREE 
HIMSELF FROM PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE COULD BE SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON.

A Huntington Beach teen-ager who claimed that he killed his roommate to free 
himself from months of physical and sexual abuse was found guilty Wednesday of 
first-degree murder in the 1989 shooting death. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Applegate, 17, could be sent to prison for 27 years to life by Superior 
Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald. The judge also has the option of sending 
Applegate to the California Youth Authority, where he could be released at age 
25. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just shocked at this jury's verdict," Deputy Public Defender Carol Lavacot 
said. "With the evidence of abuse we were able to show, I don't think anybody 
expected this." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick H. Donahue did not show the same surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a first-degree murder case," the prosecutor said. "The evidence of 
premeditation was in the defendant's own taped confession." 
</P>
<P>
Applegate, who was 16 at the time of the murder, admitted to police that he 
shot Paul Londono, 25, on Jan. 8, 1989, and then burned his body near the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
But Applegate testified that he had been repeatedly raped by Londono and was 
often beaten. He said he decided the only way he would ever be free would be to 
kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Lavacot called a stream of character witnesses in an effort to 
show that Londono was manipulative and had dominated Applegate. 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution argued that Applegate was a sophisticated teen-ager who 
tried to cover up his crime and nearly succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very bright fellow," Donahue said Wednesday. "He was able to 
convince even some of the victim's relatives that he had nothing to do with his 
death. And he almost got away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Several months after the shooting, acquaintances of Applegate saw bloodstains 
on his bedding. A police investigation followed, and Applegate was arrested a 
short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate met Londono in Florida when Applegate was a busboy at a gay bar, 
although Lavacot claims that Applegate himself is not gay. Both sides agree 
that the two young men struck up a friendship and moved to California together 
in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate had been on probation for car theft in Florida. He said Londono had 
told him that if he did not submit to a homosexual relationship, he would see 
to it that Applegate was sent to prison in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
But on the day Londono was killed, witnesses testified, he had told his 
relatives that he had been trying to get Applegate to move out and that the 
younger man had refused. Londono was shot in the head as he slept. 
</P>
<P>
"No one will ever really know what all happened there before the shooting," 
Donahue said. "But it's clear that the defendant sat down and thought about 
what he was going to do before he did it. That's first-degree murder." 
</P>
<P>
Lavacot said she had expected the jurors to return with a voluntary 
manslaughter verdict at most. 
</P>
<P>
She said she plans to argue a substantial case at the June 15 sentencing 
hearing in seeking a Youth Authority commitment for her client; Donahue said he 
will argue in favor of a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this guy back out on the streets when he is 25," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate was tried as an adult after prosecutors cited the sophistication of 
the crime and Applegate's criminal record.

EX-CAMPAIGN MANAGER SUES PHYLLIS BADHAM 
</P>

Phyllis Badham, who is trying to unseat 70th District Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
in the June primary, was sued Wednesday by her former campaign manager for 
breach of contract and nonpayment of more than $11,000 in fees and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Political consultant Robert Kiley filed the lawsuit in Harbor Municipal Court 
after several weeks of unsuccessful efforts to settle the dispute, said Kiley's 
attorney, Ronald E. Isles. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly tried to settle it," Isles said. "Bob offered to cut his fee in 
half." 
</P>
<P>
Badham, 30, a public relations manager in her first campaign for public office, 
said she fired Kiley because he wasn't fulfilling his part of the contract the 
two signed last February. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob had misrepresented himself as a political consultant," Badham said. "He 
wasn't producing. . . . These are the big leagues, and he's not ready for the 
big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kiley: "I feel I lived up to my side of the contract." 
</P>
<P>
Kiley's contract with Badham called for a $15,000 fee to be paid in several 
installments, plus expenses and bonuses in the event that Badham won the June 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Kiley said Badham paid the first $3,000 installment and one $1,500 installment 
after that but was unable to meet the schedule of remaining payments. 
</P>
<P>
Badham, a moderate Republican trying to oust the staunchly conservative 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), is the daughter of former Rep. Robert Badham. She 
was initially given at least a fighting chance against Ferguson by some 
political insiders, but her campaign has been slowed by sluggish fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
In her last campaign disclosure statement filed in March, Badham reported 
outstanding debts of about $12,500, with a cash balance of $4,200. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson reported outstanding debts of $54,100 and about $12,000 cash on hand 
during the same reporting period, during which he was in the midst of a race 
for the vacant 31st state Senate District seat. That race was won by 
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
Kiley, who is now running the campaign of Republican candidate Paul Horcher in 
the 52nd Assembly District in Los Angeles County, left Badham's campaign in 
early April just days after issuing a news release on Badham campaign 
letterhead announcing his hiring as her strategist and overall manager. The 
release also said Michael Fiorina, a Beverly Hills attorney, would be Badham's 
day-to-day manager. 
</P>
<P>
Badham said she never approved the news release. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Kiley was told April 8 by Fiorina that there was some 
"bad news. . . . We can no longer afford your services. Money is not coming in 
as expected. I haven't even been paid myself. Since your (sic) not willing to 
work with us on this money thing we just have to let you go." 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Kiley received notice from his bank that a $3,000 check 
issued by Badham on April 6 had been returned because of a stop-payment order 
from Badham, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to see Phyllis taking bad advice," Kiley said. "I feel that without 
a political strategist and a seasoned staff, they're going to have a very 
difficult time pulling this together by June."

IRVINE ACTS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
APARTMENTS: CITY COUNCIL CHOOSES THREE POSSIBLE SITES FROM A LIST OF 10. THERE 
WOULD BE 200 UNITS BUILT, HALF FOR LOW-INCOME TENANTS.

<P>
Joining a number of communities that use nonprofit housing corporations to meet 
affordable housing quotas mandated by state law, the City Council has chosen 
three possible sites to build a development of 100 apartments for low-income 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Because candidates to live in affordable housing are defined by state law as 
people earning less than 80% of the county median income -- it currently is 
$47,000 per year -- Irvine's project would include households that earn between 
$23,000 and $40,000 per year, in addition to poverty-level families earning 
$14,000 or less annually. 
</P>
<P>
"In affluent Orange County, low-cost housing is really higher," said Planning 
Commission Chairwoman Mary Ann Gaido, president of the Irvine Community Housing 
Corp., the city's new nonprofit housing firm. "We're trying to get people into 
housing that might otherwise be out of their reach." 
</P>
<P>
The housing corporation is proposing to erect its first apartment project in a 
partnership with Bridge Inc., a San Francisco-based, nonprofit firm that has 
developed 3,500 affordable homes in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for construction of 200 apartments, 50% of which would have rents 
skewed for lower incomes. The rest would be rented at market rates, Gaido said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's selection of three housing areas, from a list of 10 Irvine 
Co.-owned sites, enables Bridge representatives to seek permission from Bridge 
directors for what would be the company's first Southern California project. If 
the plan is approved, Bridge would submit a financial proposal to the council, 
at which time the top three sites would be narrowed to one, City Manager Paul 
O. Brady Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
The three sites selected Tuesday are a 15-acre parcel at the corner of Harvard 
Avenue and San Leon Drive, across from City Hall; a 24-acre parcel south of 
Harvard Park and near railroad tracks along Harvard Avenue; and a one-acre 
parcel near the Home and Garden Center at the intersection of Culver and Irvine 
Center drives. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for our children, the people who teach our children, the workers who 
are here, and the ones to come," Councilwoman Paula Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
If the first project proves successful, the two sites not chosen could later be 
used to house affordable complexes, Brady said. The city already has $500,000 
in federal community block grant funds to be used for the purchase of 
affordable home sites, said senior planner Maya Dunne. 
</P>
<P>
Since offering a list of possible project sites last month, Irvine Co. 
officials have not said whether they would donate the land or sell it at a 
reduced rate to the nonprofit builders. 
</P>
<P>
But company officials have been enthusiastic in their support of the program 
because they can contract with the lower-cost, nonprofit firms to meet 
affordable housing quotas required of the city's private developers. In August, 
those quotas were upped to include 25% of all residential projects constructed 
after October, 1989. Since 1974, the city's affordable housing requirements 
have provided 3,000 units scattered throughout the city's market-rate projects, 
Gaido said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nonprofit (housing firms) can get profits and tax breaks that the private 
sector can't," said Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Raymond Watson, who serves with 
Werner on the committee that recommended the formation of Irvine Community 
Housing Corp.

MORALES SEEKS A THREE-PEAT AT MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Morales has a knack for throwing objects of all sorts -- the discus, the 
shotput and the hammer. He will throw them all in the Big West Conference track 
and field championships at Las Vegas this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
And afterward, he has in mind a final chuck of the discus, of which he has 
grown tired. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking forward to getting rid of the discus," Morales said. "I'll 
go throw all those in the lake, I tell myself." 
</P>
<P>
Before he has done that, however, he hopes to have thrown the discus farther 
than anyone else at the meet -- and the same goes for the shot and the hammer, 
his specialty. Morales will be going for a rare triple, trying to win all three 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's ever been done," Morales said. He's right. Others have won 
Big West titles in two of the three events in past years -- including Utah 
State's Craig Carter, who beat Morales in the discus and hammer last year. But 
no one has won all three in the 20-year history of the conference 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like winning the 100, the 200 and the 4 x 100 (relay) because you're 
fast," Morales said. "These are completely different even though they're all 
throwing. They're so remarkably different." 
</P>
<P>
They are so different, and training for all three can be so counterproductive, 
that Morales catches it from all ends. Discus coaches advise him to quit the 
hammer; his hammer coach tells him to quit throwing the discus. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't mesh very well," Morales said. "On the shot, I slide. The disc is 
one turn, the hammer is four." 
</P>
<P>
Even his mind and body have occasionally reminded him that trying to do so much 
may be too much. 
</P>
<P>
Once, after competing in the hammer, Morales began warming up for the discus. 
</P>
<P>
"I freaked out and did a hammer turn, just in warm-up," he said. "It was kind 
of embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Morales came to Irvine as a discus thrower from Garden Grove High School, where 
he also had competed in the shot. His specialty was to be the discus. "Or so we 
all thought," Morales said. But it has been the hammer at which he has 
excelled, after idly picking it up and teaching himself to throw it. 
</P>
<P>
His throw of 212 feet this season is the top mark in the conference. His shot 
mark of 56-4 3/4 is also the best, and Morales is the defending Big West 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
In the discus, he is second to Utah State's Roger Daley, whom he has beaten 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my least favorite," Morales said. "I can't practice it very much or I 
go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The discus, to his thinking, will be the most difficult to win of the three. 
The other two he all but guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
"Unquestionably, I'll win the shot, definitely," Morales said. "The hammer is 
almost as sure as the shot, although sometimes goofy things happen in that 
event. Last year I should have won, but I ended up only third. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Craig Carter took (the hammer) from me," Morales said. "This year 
was going to be revenge. But he redshirted, that dog." 
</P>
<P>
Having already qualified for the NCAA championships May 30-June 2 at Duke 
University in Durham, N.C., where he is seeded third, Morales is still drawing 
out his training, intending to peak later. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to peak in the discus and the shot for Big West. The hammer I don't plan 
to throw real far, just far enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
After the NCAA championships, Morales' career at Irvine will be over. He says 
he plans to continue competing in the shot and the hammer, with an eye on 
trying to make the U.S. Olympic team as a hammer thrower in 1992 or 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Morales figures that process will include beefing up from around 215 pounds to 
230 or 240, and perhaps seeking out more coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not tapped out physically," he said. "I have a lot of potential, a lot of 
room for improvement. A lot of guys are really strong already, and I'm right up 
there with them already." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Patton and his tennis team are awaiting word on whether they make the NCAA 
tennis championships, which begin May 18 at Indian Wells. Selections will be 
made during a conference call today, and are to be announced Friday. 
</P>

Zack Williams felt the pressure Wednesday in the Southern Section 4-A diving 
championships at the Industry Hills Swim Center. He also responded to it. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a freshman from Irvine High School, was chased throughout the day by 
teammate Chris Vonk. The two were no more than 10 points apart throughout the 
competition and, with three dives left, Vonk pulled to within six points. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be Chris and me before the meet," Williams said. "He 
kept hitting his dives, so I knew I couldn't make a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Although only 14 years old, Williams showed the pose of a senior. He held off 
Vonk to finish first with 516.25 points. Vonk, a sophomore, was second with 
487. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Hubbart of Mission Viejo was third (437.65), Mike Churgel of Fountain 
Valley fourth (377.20) and David Chavez of Fontana fifth (374.05). 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Daryl Dolan of Simi Valley rallied in her final 
three dives to win the competition. Dolan finished with 456.05 points. 
</P>
<P>
Joy Burkholder of Capistrano Valley was second (449.40), Jennie Maxwell of 
Capistrano Valley third (447.35), Amy Palmer of Dana Hills fourth (421.05) and 
Christine Everaert of Sonora fifth (415.50). 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, a freshman, led most of the event. But midway through the meet, Dolan 
began to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
On her sixth dive, Dolan was scored 10, 9, 8 1/2, 8, 8. She made three strong 
dives at the end to pull ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' competition, Williams and Vonk dominated the field for most of the 
meet. Hubbart hung close for a while, but by the time the field was trimmed to 
16 divers, it was pretty much an all-Irvine competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought I had him with my last dive," Vonk said. "It was my best of 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
However, Williams out-pointed Vonk on his last dive to win the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really scared going into that last dive," Williams said. "Chris put the 
pressure on. I just tried to remain calm, which was tough. But I managed to do 
it."

<P>
The race for the Orange League baseball championship remained unsettled 
Wednesday because Magnolia upset Brea-Olinda, 7-2, by capitalizing on four 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (16-7-1, 10-3-1 in league) appeared to be headed toward a 
title-clinching victory. The Wildcats had a 2-0 lead after three innings and 
starter Pat Simec (3-4) had retired the first nine batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
But Magnolia (12-9, 10-4) scored five runs on four hits and three errors in the 
fourth inning to take a 5-2 lead and win its fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Chad Phillips (6-1) allowed an unearned run in the first inning and a 
bases-empty home run by Brea's John Toro in the third. But the right-hander 
retired the last 15 batters he faced, striking out seven and allowing three 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia, which still has a slim chance to win the title, concludes its season 
Friday against Anaheim. Brea concludes its season against Valencia, a team it 
has beaten twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It (winning the league) is still in our hands," said Steve Hiskey, Brea's 
coach. "Obviously, we would have liked to have taken care of it today. We made 
some mistakes and they got going. We gave them too many free bases." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Schlect had the big hit for Magnolia in the fourth inning, a two-run 
double that Brea outfielder Mike Ryan had trouble fielding. Magnolia added an 
unearned run in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were a little overanxious at the start, but we settled down and 
showed we're a good hitting team," said John Sharp, Magnolia's first-year 
coach. "I told the kids before the game that they're as good as they want to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think we can win the league title, but we're going to need some help 
from Valencia on Friday. Either way, we're in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
In another Orange League game: 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 4, Savanna 0 -- Sammy Serna had a hit, an RBI and scored a run and 
Robert Fernandez (3-7) pitched his second shutout, a three-hitter, with six 
strikeouts and two walks to lead host Anaheim (14-9-1, 8-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
In Angelus League baseball: 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat 5, Servite 3 -- Visiting Servite (16-9, 5-6) scored its three runs 
in the first inning with Ed Crippen and Chad Rolish hitting RBI singles. 
</P>
<P>
In Empire League baseball: 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 5, Loara 0 -- Ray Bridges (2-5) pitched a two-hitter, striking three 
and walking one to lead host Cypress (5-20, 2-12).

ECONOMISTS FRET OVER COUNTY'S 2% GROWTH RATE; 
</P>
<P>
POPULATION: A GAIN OF 46,800, MOSTLY GENERATED INTERNALLY, IS EASILY TOPPED BY 
THREE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. AND THEIR NEW RESIDENTS HAVE GREATER PURCHASING 
POWER. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's population crept up a scant 2% in 1989, overshadowed by the 
faster growth rates of its eastern and southern neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
And while the county's slower growth pace was anticipated -- in fact, the 
annual growth rate has not really changed in the past decade -- it is causing 
some economists and demographers to fret about the future. 
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the state Department of Finance pegged Orange County's 
population as of Jan. 1 at nearly 2.33 million, up from 2.28 million a year 
earlier, for a net gain of 46,800 people. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, San Diego, San Bernardino and Riverside counties added a 
total of 266,100 new residents. 
</P>
<P>
Those three counties accounted for 34% of the state's total population 
increase, with growth rates ranging from a low of 3.8% for San Diego County to 
Riverside's 8.3%. Although Orange County's lower growth rate translates into a 
lower level of demand for government services and less impact on traffic 
congestion than experienced by neighboring counties, it also can have a 
negative impact on the local economy, says Chapman College economist James 
Doti. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's growth is now almost all generated internally -- from additions 
to current residents' families -- while the surrounding counties are getting 
the in-migration that once drove Orange County's growth, Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
"And that affects the demand for housing, retail sales, local savings and 
investment rates" and many other economic factors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In-migration generally brings in new residents in their 30s and up, people with 
jobs, with steady incomes that provide money for retail shopping and for 
savings, and with equity from a previous residence that they can invest in new 
homes, Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
Population increases from natural birth rates don't bring those benefits, he 
said, because there is no significant increase in the wage-earning population. 
</P>
<P>
Doti said studies by Chapman's Center of Economic Research show that more than 
80% of the county's 1989 population increase came from natural growth and that 
the percentage is growing. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, he said, this is because the cost of housing in Orange County 
has become so high it is turning away would-be immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Doti said local government policies are to blame for high housing prices 
because of density restrictions, fees and other limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Lepore, senior research analyst with the county administrative office, 
sees a different villain -- a scarcity of land in many parts of the county and 
the high cost of developing the hillsides and canyons that make up most of the 
remaining raw acreage. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 20 years, he said, the population of South Orange County will come 
to equal the population of North County, meaning most of the future residential 
construction will be done on South County's corrugated landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The state population figures bear out that prediction. 
</P>
<P>
The unincorporated areas of the county -- located mainly in the south -- grew 
by 20,400 last year, or nearly half the total population increase. 
</P>
<P>
And in North Orange County, with the exception of Huntington Beach -- which has 
seen depleted oil lands opening up to development -- the main growth areas have 
been in the eastern hills. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's population grew by 3,600, a 1.5% increase to 247,800, mainly because 
of development in the Santa Ana Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
The same hillsides provided building pads for the homes that enabled Yorba 
Linda to post a 9.4% growth rate, to 52,400 from 47,900. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of one of the few remaining stretches of flat land in the county, 
the Irvine Co.'s Tustin Ranch development, helped Tustin post the 
second-largest increase of any city in the county, up 5.7% to 49,400 from 
46,750 in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY POPULATION GROWTH 
</P>
<P>
State officials estimate that Orange County's population grew 2.1% in 1989, 
with the largest increases Yorba Linda, Tustin, Dana Point and unincorporated 
areas.

TOXIC WASTE FEARS DELAYED FREEDOM'S NEWSPAPER PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Jonathan Weber, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Freedom Newspapers Inc. agreed to buy a group of weekly newspapers in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties for an estimated $20 million late last year, 
the deal was expected to close by the end of February. But soon March had past, 
and still Freedom had not reached a definitive agreement with the seller, Media 
General Inc. The contracts were finally signed April 8. 
</P>
<P>
Such a delay would hardly be worth noting, except for the reason behind it: 
concerns over environmental liability. Freedom, it seems, wanted to be 
absolutely certain that it wasn't buying itself a toxic waste nightmare along 
with Golden West Publishing Co., which publishes eight weekly newspapers in the 
South County, four in the North County and 10 in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West chief executive Ron Redfern said the concerns were focused on the 
company's printing facility and headquarters in City of Industry. Solvent 
contamination had been discovered at a site Golden West had once leased next to 
its main plant, and Freedom wanted to be sure there was no repeat. 
</P>
<P>
Redfern noted that the acquisition was a stock transaction and not just an 
asset purchase, so Freedom would be liable for any future cleanup obligations. 
The company therefore would not sign off on the deal until extensive soil 
sampling and other environmental testing had been completed and agreements had 
been reached on indemnification. 
</P>
<P>
The astronomical costs of cleaning up toxic wastes -- and a federal law which 
allows regulators to seek cleanup money from any company that has ever had 
anything to do with the site in question -- has made environmental liability an 
increasingly important factor in the corporate acquisitions game. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Wall Street Journal, environmental risk factors have scotched 
several recent buyouts, including a $660-million deal by the Sterling Group, a 
Houston-based leveraged buyout firm, to purchase a former Koppers Co. chemical 
business from Beazer PLC in 1988.

$25-MILLION HOME FOR RUTAN &amp; TUCKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The law firm of Rutan &amp; Tucker, one of the county's larger office tenants, 
has negotiated a new lease at Central Bank Tower in Costa Mesa said by the 
landlord to be worth about $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
The lease is one of the largest in Orange County this year, covering 90,000 
square feet over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said such a large tenant as Rutan &amp; Tucker probably negotiated a 
very favorable deal with the landlord, C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
With the market glutted with office space and vacancy rates high, landlords 
have been forced to make big concessions to larger tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm -- the largest based in Orange County -- had two years left on its 
original lease, which it signed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, the firm, which was founded in Santa Ana in 1906, has doubled 
in size to more than 100 lawyers. The firm represents clients in business, 
government and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
It now occupies the 11th through the 15th floors at Central Bank Tower. 
</P>
<P>
The new lease has an option allowing Rutan &amp; Tucker to take another 20,000 
square feet in the building. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said it elected to stay after looking at "a number of potential office 
sites." 
</P>
<P>
Rutan &amp; Tucker decided to remain because it liked the location -- across 
the street from the South Coast Plaza mall -- and the opportunity to expand, 
said managing partner Richard Sims.

Sean Saunders is a black teen-ager growing up in Orange County. His dad is a 
dermatologist, his bedroom is festooned with posters of the heavy metal rock 
group Iron Maiden and he owns both a Toyota truck and a $3,000 motorbike that 
he often races in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
A standout football player at Foothill High School, where he is only one of 12 
black students, Saunders, 17, dates and befriends only whites. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here since I was 6 years old so I am not accustomed to much else," 
he said. "I don't feel weird when I am around whites because I feel truly 
accepted by them -- at parties or wherever. It's around other blacks that I 
don't feel like I belong. I don't speak the language." 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away, in a tiny apartment within earshot of the Costa Mesa Freeway, 
Ali Shephard, 18, listens to the music of the controversial rap group Public 
Enemy and talks about Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela and social issues concerning 
blacks.

Shephard, whose father died four years ago, works nearly 40 hours a week as a 
stock boy at the nearby Drug Emporium to help his mother pay the bills and to 
save for college. He prefers to date black women and surrounds himself with a 
close-knit circle of black friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is OK and all," Shephard said. "There are certainly a lot worse 
places to be, but I do miss being around more of my people. It's like two 
different worlds out here -- theirs and ours -- and they make sure you don't 
forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Saunders and Shephard are the two extremes of what is a complicated and often 
painful struggle within Orange County's small, scattered black community -- the 
desire to assimilate into what some consider a less-than-friendly white society 
while maintaining a sense of African-American identity. 
</P>
<P>
While other minorities are flocking to Orange County in search of economic 
opportunity, the number of blacks remains stagnant. Out of 2.3 million 
residents, blacks have made up less than 2% of the county's population for 
decades. And observers say it is unlikely those numbers will increase in the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County has never been a place viewed as very hospitable to black folk," 
said Thomas Parham, director of career planning and placement at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, if you looked at the way things were out here, you'll see the 
John Birch Society and the ultra-conservative John Waynes were the dominant 
forces," he said, "which makes it somewhat difficult for blacks to feel that 
this a place with its arms extended, welcoming them in." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the scarcity of blacks here are complicated and intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the major migration of blacks from other parts of the country to 
Southern California had already ended by the time Orange County developed into 
a flourishing commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks began their slow but steady migration to the West Coast shortly after 
World War I. More than 1 million blacks left the south and moved north to 
Chicago and New York, and west to Los Angeles and Oakland for the better jobs 
that had been created by the wartime activity. 
</P>
<P>
The largest migration was between 1965 and 1970, when nearly 100,000 blacks 
moved to Los Angeles. After that, the migration slowed considerably. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County didn't get major industries until the mid to late '60s," said 
William Gayk, county analyst. "Many people move out to Orange County because of 
their jobs, and since there probably weren't many jobs at the time when blacks 
were moving, they didn't have a reason to move to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
And now, the high cost of housing in Orange County -- where houses routinely 
sell for $200,000 and more -- is far beyond the reach of many black families, 
whose average household income nationally is half that of whites. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest national figures by the U.S. Census Bureau, the average 
black family's income is only 57% of that for whites, while the unemployment 
for blacks is double that for whites. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to say it's economics more than anything else," said a black Orange 
County real estate agent, who declined to be named. "I've been selling homes 
for 10 years now, and I can say that I've only sold homes to 10 black families 
during that period. One a year. We as a people just don't have the financial 
base for this type of affluent lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
But many mobile, affluent blacks who could afford to move here say the county 
simply has a reputation that keeps them away. 
</P>
<P>
Take Luther Hill, a vice president of a Los Angeles bank who lives in the 
exclusive black community of Baldwin Hills in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I could afford to live in Orange County if I wanted to, as I feel many other 
blacks living in L.A. and other parts of Southern California could," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends and I have even discussed it. The area doesn't appeal to me for 
various reasons, including the way I know many blacks have been treated there. 
Why would I want to subject myself to that with all the other things I must 
deal with on a day-to-day basis?" 
</P>
<P>
To most outsiders, Orange County has always been viewed as staunchly 
conservative, uniformly white and uncompromisingly rigid in its political 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, for example, four-fifths of the Anaheim City Council, most of the 
city's police force and the publisher of the city's largest newspaper were open 
about their membership in the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
But many blacks say it was an incident two years ago that fueled fears of 
racism. On Sept. 4, 1988, Sundaga Bryant, a black man strolling on a Balboa 
shore late at night with a portable radio, was shot in his arms and torso by 
Newport police, who mistook the radio for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the kind of anxiety you feel in place like this, particularly as a 
black man," Parham said. "And worse in a situation like this is that the 
officer was not punished, and no one from the white community spoke out and 
said, 'Hey, this is wrong.' They see a black with something in his hand and, of 
course, it's a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's lawsuit against the city of Newport Beach seeking more than $1 million 
in damages is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Though the incident was an extreme example, many blacks cite a more subtle 
racism they face daily. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the more than 15 black men interviewed for this article, 14 said they 
had been stopped by local police more than once for no apparent reason and were 
questioned about everything from their car registration to their whereabouts 
during a local crime. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been times when I was just walking around my block in Tustin, and 
the police would just stop me and ask if I had anything to do with some robbery 
that had just been committed," said 21-year-old Bruce Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
"As a black man in America, I am accustomed to the fact that I am viewed as the 
most probable possible criminal," he said. "But it's sad to say that here the 
attitude is 10 times more intense." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Cox, an offensive tackle for the Los Angeles Rams who lives in Anaheim, 
noted that on more than one occasion he has been stopped by police to check the 
registration of his black Bonneville. 
</P>
<P>
"I am from Northern California, so all of this is really new to me," Cox said. 
" I mean the whole attitude that is here in Orange County is totally different 
from any other place I've lived. When I go into places, I get funny looks and 
you know automatically what they're thinking: 'What's he doing here, he doesn't 
belong.' " 
</P>
<P>
Though Orange County area police deny any concentrated effort to detain blacks 
without reason, Milton Grimes, a Santa Ana defense attorney who is black, 
acknowledges that it's a common occurrence for black men to be detained by 
police in mostly white suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate reality, but true," Grimes said. "Black men are targeted 
day after day for this type of what I call harassment. I tell young black men 
all the time -- 'if it happens, file a complaint. Let them know you won't stand 
for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
But despite these problems, more than 25,000 blacks have decided to call Orange 
County home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here most of my life, so I really like and enjoy what Orange County 
has to offer," said Vicki Jones, a sales clerk at South Coast Plaza who lives 
in Irvine. "My family is removed from that inner-city crime, the gangs and all 
the other bad elements that you find in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Socially, the black community in Orange County exists primarily where it always 
has since the days of slavery -- in the Baptist church. 
</P>
<P>
"The church has always been the mainstay of the black community," said the Rev. 
John McReynolds, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Santa Ana, which has one of 
the largest congregations in the county. "Everything from the music we all 
listen to, to the dancing we all do and love has its roots in the black church. 
It's vital to the community." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 27 black churches in Orange County, various black social 
clubs, such as the LINKS and Delta Sigma Theta, hold monthly meetings and black 
history events that also bring together the otherwise virtually invisible 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"When blacks want to see other blacks in Orange County, there are various 
outlets, including social events," said McReynolds. "It does take effort though 
because 25,000 people may sound like a large number, but when in comparison to 
more than 2 million people, it's a faint drop in the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
But while black adults in Orange County have a variety of ways to socialize, 
experts say black children can have a tough adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"Growing up in Orange County can have a very negative effect on black children, 
particularly since they are so isolated from the traditional black community 
and role models," said Dr. Phyl Robinson, an Anaheim-based psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"These children have an incredibly hard time defining who they are amidst blond 
hair and blue eyes. Self-esteem and a sense of worth for blacks is more easily 
found in a more ethnically diverse community." 
</P>
<P>
For Sean Saunders, it has meant immersing his identity within the white 
mainstream, from the music he likes to the clothes he wears. He says most of 
his fellow black students at Foothill High are accepted because they excel in 
some area, particularly sports. 
</P>
<P>
"We (blacks) are all good at something, so that always helps," said Saunders, 
who is co-captain of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
But for Ali Shephard, playing "hoop ball" with the "brothers" is where he finds 
the most comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his busy work schedule, Shephard manages to keep a B-plus average in 
school and plans to attend Grambling College, a predominantly black school in 
the South, after he graduates from Tustin High School. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Tustin High where white and black students exchanged potent racial 
slurs after a talent show last March, and Ali was there. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that lets me know that's the way they feel 24 hours a day and seven 
days of the week," Ali said. "You don't call someone a 'nigger' out of the 
clear-blue sky. It has to be something they've wanted to say all along." 
</P>
<P>
To combat some of the anger, negative feelings and questions young blacks may 
have about themselves and their community, various local black social groups 
hold regular programs aimed at educating the black child on his culture and 
boosting self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be difficult, but there are ways of instilling in a child love for 
himself and his people in a community such as this," said Parham, who regularly 
speaks to groups of young people about African heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some parents realize what isolation from their culture can do to a 
child and are making that extra effort to expose them to cultural events 
pertaining to black history." 
</P>
<P>
But Parham also notes that while many middle-class Orange County blacks are 
introducing their children to black history, others are deciding against it for 
fear of alienating their children from the white majority. 
</P>
<P>
"Feeling good about yourself," he pointed out, "does not mean feeling bad about 
others."

JOSEPH N. BELL: CHOICE BETWEEN RIGHT WING AND LAROUCHE WING PIQUES SOME VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I get a lot of mail from Orange County citizens -- the majority of them 
Republicans -- deeply distressed that election after election they feel 
themselves disenfranchised because they are not offered local candidates they 
can vote for in good conscience. These are people who find themselves 
philosophically out of sync with the archconservative Republicans who mostly 
represent Orange County in Sacramento and Washington but don't feel the 
Democrats are offering enough viable alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Why, they ask, don't the Democrats give us more electable candidates? And how 
can the Democrats screw up so badly that we sometimes find ourselves with a 
choice between a Republican with totally unacceptable social views and a 
follower of convicted felon Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.? 
</P>
<P>
That scenario happened four years ago, when former Superior Court Judge Bruce 
Sumner ran a successful write-in campaign to prevent a LaRouche candidate from 
representing the Democratic party against Republican incumbent Robert Badham. 
</P>
<P>
It happened two years ago in GOP incumbent William E. Dannemeyer's 39th 
Congressional District, where the voters in the Democratic primary were offered 
a choice between two candidates who both supported an AIDS referendum measure 
that was rejected resoundingly in Orange County as well as throughout the 
state. It is for all practical purposes happening in Robert K. Dornan's 38th 
Congressional District this year. And it came within an hour of happening in 
the 70th Assembly District now represented by Republican incumbent Gil 
Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic circus in Dornan's 38th district got most of the attention 
because of Ron Kovic's well-chronicled last-minute defection. His hurried 
replacement, abortion rights activist Barbara Jackson, decided after filing 
that she was doing a disservice to her employer, Planned Parenthood, by running 
and tried to withdraw -- too late. So now we have an official Democratic 
candidate who says she won't campaign and "might" accept the Democratic 
nomination if she wins it anyway. And standing in the wings, ready to represent 
the Democrats once again is -- you guessed it -- LaRouche follower Art Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
The Kovic retreat tended to obscure what was taking place in the 70th Assembly 
District, which is probably more typical of Democratic problems in Orange 
County these days. The man who laid his body in the breach there is a highly 
successful Newport Beach businessman and longtime Democratic activist -- and 
former county chairman -- named Howard Adler. So I dropped by his office to 
find out how all this happened -- and why. Along with answers, I also got a 
short course in Orange County politics. 
</P>
<P>
According to Adler, he hadn't the slightest intention of running for public 
office in 1990. But on filing deadline day -- aware of the perils of rounding 
up Democratic candidates in Orange County -- he phoned current party chairman 
Michael Balmages to find out if a search for a candidate to run against 
Ferguson had been successful. Balmages assured him that it had. 
</P>
<P>
But later that day, only an hour before the filing deadline, Adler says 
Balmages tracked him down in Richard O'Neill's Santa Ana office. Instant 
crisis. It turned out the Democratic candidate in the 70th Assembly District 
didn't qualify because he hadn't been a registered Democrat long enough. Would 
Adler help? 
</P>
<P>
"So," Adler told me, "since I'm the ultimate party man and also a little bit 
crazy, I filed. I have no illusions about beating Ferguson in that district, 
but there are other reasons we should run the best candidates we can find -- 
even in districts we know we can't win." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested three paramount reasons: 
</P>
<P>
* "If we have any real conviction in the two-party system, we have to give 
people a decent Democrat to vote for." 
</P>
<P>
* "Any activity we generate on behalf of our local candidates helps the top of 
the ticket. Democratic candidates in Orange County should be running with the 
understanding that their performance can have a considerable impact on state 
and national candidates." 
</P>
<P>
* "The Lyndon LaRouche dilemma. They'll fill every void they see, and if they 
are allowed to do that, it gives them credibility with the public and seats on 
the Central Committee. The Republicans, incidentally, have the same problem in 
heavily Democratic districts." 
</P>
<P>
Given these three reasons, why is it so difficult for the Democrats to field 
viable candidates in so many Orange County contests? 
</P>
<P>
"Because," says Adler, "the numbers make it clear that in most areas of Orange 
County, the Democratic candidate doesn't have a chance. That hasn't always been 
true, and I think it will change, but it is true right now." 
</P>
<P>
Why is it true when polls consistently show that current Republican incumbents 
in Orange County have social views very different from the majority of citizens 
here -- especially on such matters as abortion and the environment? Why can't 
the Democrats exploit this disparity? 
</P>
<P>
Adler shrugged. "I don't believe those polls," he said. "Either they are 
inaccurate -- people say one thing and believe another -- or those people don't 
vote in elections. Then, of course, there are the business people who tell me 
they are embarrassed by the quality of our representatives in Sacramento and 
Washington, especially those who have violated laws and political ethics 
because they don't feel they have to account to the voters. But if we give 
these business people a good Democrat, they still won't vote for him because in 
their social structure, it just isn't the thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Adler says he's already evolved the theme on which he plans to campaign, "and 
I'll try to encourage other Democrats to do the same. If the Soviet Union and 
Nicaragua and Eastern Europe can throw off the yoke of the one-party system, so 
can Orange County. We need to restore the two-party system here." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't smile when he said it. 
</P>
<P>
He feels that politics tend to be cyclic and that a shift is taking place in 
both the country and the state "because the public wants problems handled and 
they feel the Democrats can do that better than the Republicans. When that 
shift happens, when the state and national Democratic candidates become more 
successful, it will be reflected here. There's a swing group of maybe 10% to 
15% of Orange County voters who were Democrats in the Kennedy years and shifted 
to the Republicans when Reagan ran. By 1994, we'll start seeing that swing 
back, and then we'll get more viable local Democratic candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of us may be looking at a choice between LaRouche and LaRouche.

REVELERS WITH A CAUSE RAISE CASH FOR FREE MEDICAL CLINIC IN ORANGE; 
</P>
<P>
$90,000 WILL GO TO LESTONNAC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Loosen your ties, loosen your panty hose -- loosen whatever you have to 
loosen," Melissa Manchester told the crowd in the Disneyland Hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
The black-tie audience looked like statuary as the pop singer lit into her next 
song -- the only unbound, unfettered, busted-out thing about them was all the 
loose cash they'd dropped to be there. 
</P>
<P>
Three hundred bucks per couple, more for the better seats. 
</P>
<P>
So they didn't shake their ball gowns or boogie in their cummerbunds. No sweat. 
They were there for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The 530 guests at Saturday's "Mardi Gras Celebration" dinner and concert came 
to support the Lestonnac Free Medical Clinic in Orange, a nonprofit agency that 
provides medical and dental care to the county's poor. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit raised $90,000, according to Allen Boerner, who co-chaired the 
fund-raiser with his wife, Susan. The money will help pay off the clinic's 
mortgage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the somewhat late celebration of Fat Tuesday, Susan Boerner and others on 
the party committee dressed the ballroom in columns of brightly colored 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep telling me I match the balloons," said Boerner, who wore a flashy 
silk gown. "I've been so locked into thinking about the color schemes (for the 
party) I just subconsciously bought a dress to match." 
</P>
<P>
With her punky short haircut and jeweled shoulder-length earrings, Boerner 
looked like a pop maven herself. She and her husband, who donated $25,000 to 
underwrite Manchester's appearance, dined front and center with the clinic's 
founder, Sister Marie Therese, and friends Brenda and James Dobell, Deede and 
Mike Ferman and Sheila and Jim Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Also seated at one of the dance floor tables was Doug Daigle, who in December 
raised more than $100,000 for the clinic with a headline-grabbing stunt of 
hovering a helicopter over the parking lot of Anaheim Stadium for more than two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"One of those things you do once," he said with a laugh. Daigle sat with Jill 
and Orville Hatfield, Jessica and Harlow Richardson, Elsa and Pete Wenger and 
Damon Bennett, the newest member of the Rotorheads, a clinic support group 
whose members are helicopter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Lamb, president of the clinic's board of directors, said Lestonnac served 
about 5,000 patients last year and will probably serve at least a thousand more 
in 1990. She said the doctors and nurses donate their time, and many reach into 
their own pockets to help pay for medication for patients, many of whom are 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year when we make our budget, we keep our fingers crossed," Lamb said. 
"All of our money comes from grants, foundations and private donations -- we 
don't get one dollar from the government. So this is an important night for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Before Manchester and her six-man band took the stage for an hourlong set, 
guests bid on silent auction items and ate a dinner of sorrel bisque and veal 
medallions. Allen Boerner introduced the 80-year-old Sister Marie Therese, who 
was greeted at the podium with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started my work, I never thought of having anything as big as 
this," she told the crowd. "My only thought was to serve the poor. . . . You 
have come not only to eat dinner and enjoy yourselves. There was a greater 
purpose in your minds. You are people . . . who are anxious, in your own, small 
way, to help the poor. Your presence supports my work." 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Kay and Herbert Hafif, whose $150,000 donation to the 
clinic was announced at the Mardi Gras party; Margaret and Carl Karcher; 
Theresa and Stan Pawlowski; Millie and Charles Kovac; Olivia and Ben Mascardo; 
Pamela and Randy Poag; Rosalie Corless and the Rev. Robert H. Schuller. 
</P>
<P>
Bluegrass Rooters: Derby Day -- like Mardi Gras and every other quasi-holiday 
-- spawns annual parties. On Saturday afternoon, while Unbridled unburdened 
Churchill Downs of its 116th blanket of roses, two local benefits used the race 
motif to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
At Remick's restaurant in Irvine, 250 guests gathered to watch taped races and 
the Derby and eat a Southern feast of ham and turkey, cheese grits and 
biscuits, pecan and sweet potato pies. 
</P>
<P>
The $75-per-person event raised $60,000 for Court Appointed Special Advocates, 
a nonprofit organization of trained volunteers who represent abused and 
neglected children in court. 
</P>
<P>
While waiters circulated with trays of mint juleps, mimosas and champagne, 
guests in stylish silk dresses and summer suits browsed silent auction tables 
and placed bets on the races, which were broadcast on TV screens throughout the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Among those gathered at tables decorated with riding crops and jockey caps were 
Sherron and Richard Paul of Newport Beach, the top bidders for a ride in the 
Goodyear blimp (giddyap!). 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the third annual CASA fund-raiser were Linda and Fred Port, 
Anita and Tim Swift, Susan and Dennis Leibel, Linda and Gary Pack, Barbara and 
Stanley Sanderson, Linda and David Travis and Tina and Michael Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
At the Balboa Bay Club, the Orangewood Children's Foundation hosted its annual 
"Run for the Children" party, drawing 300 guests at $50 each and raising an 
estimated $30,000. The proceeds will be used for building expansion at 
Orangewood Children's Home, the county's emergency shelter for abandoned, 
abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
Guests watched taped races and the Derby on four large screens set on the 
perimeter of the main dining room, and sat at tables near the outdoor pool (the 
domain of three large papier-mache swans decorated with white orchids and pink 
roses). 
</P>
<P>
Mixing in with patrons in breezy turf club attire were Scarlett O'Hara and 
Rhett Butler dress-alikes, as well as the odd guest in jockey costume. 
</P>
<P>
Buffet offerings included "Miss Scarlett Special Salad," "Confederate 
Biscuits," "Beaumont's Inn Famous Fried Chicken" and "Apple and Cherry Cobbler 
Tara-Style."

Lenora Terrance has spent considerable time worrying about her oldest 
daughter's senior prom. 
</P>
<P>
She thinks about what type of dress 16-year-old Misty will wear next year, 
questions just how it will fit and envisions the perfect hairstyle for that 
special night. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, she worries whether her daughter will even have a date. 
</P>
<P>
Misty is one of only 20 black students who attend Brea-Olinda High School, and 
as one of 14 black girls in comparison to six black males, she faces the 
difficult situation of rarely getting asked out on dates. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way I am grateful she's not dating that much with so many things 
happening," Terrance said. "But I worry she's missing out on some of the 
wonderful things about growing up." 
</P>
<P>
Counselors and psychologists both agree that black females often suffer the 
most socially when they are in a predominantly white environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Black women as a rule are not typically considered beautiful by the American 
public," said Phyl Robinson, an Anaheim-based psychologist. "Long blond hair 
and blues eyes are posted everywhere in magazines and television as an example 
of what beautiful should look like. Black women don't fit that image." 
</P>
<P>
Though the current Miss America and Miss USA are both black, Robinson said they 
are the exception rather than the rule. She added that ebony skin and medium to 
short hair for the most part isn't attractive to men of other racial groups and 
many times not even to black men. 
</P>
<P>
"Some black males tend to also buy into the blond-hair stereotype that is 
everywhere for all to see, despite the fact their mothers and sisters are 
black," Robinson said. "And in addition to that it has always been more 
acceptable for a black man to date a white woman. For many black men, it gives 
them a feeling that they've accomplished something grand by going outside the 
race for a mate." 
</P>
<P>
Misty, who is in her junior year at Brea, says she is frustrated because the 
few black boys at her school mostly date white girls, leaving her at home most 
Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"I am bothered by it a lot," she said. "Black guys seem to think white girls 
have more going for them or something and white guys hardly notice me." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, the family has considered moving from their comfortable Brea 
home to a more ethnically mixed neighborhood. "It's something we considered 
because we want our kids to get the best experience possible in everything," 
said Chris Terrance Jr., an insurance claims adjuster who was transferred here 
from Washington state. "They are getting a good education here but there is 
more to high school than that. I'd like for Misty and our younger daughter to 
have an opportunity to meet and see a variety of people." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to rectify the problem, the family recently became involved with a 
variety of Orange County black organizations, including the Orange County Black 
Actors Theater and a black church in Santa Ana where they hope Misty will meet 
a young man her age. 
</P>
<P>
"Prom is a very important occasion in a young lady's life," said Lenora 
Terrance. "Our daughters shouldn't have to miss out on that just because some 
people don't realize how beautiful black is."

UCLA'S JASON NETTER: HIS PLAY VARIES FROM GOOD, TO BAD, TO UGLY; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: TOP SINGLES PLAYER IS AT HIS BEST IN TOURNAMENTS, BUT HIS PERFORMANCE 
SLUMPS IN DUAL MEETS. 
</P>

<P>
Jason Netter, top singles player for the UCLA men's tennis team, can be either 
very good or very bad, but he was at his best at the biggest event of the 
season so far -- the Pacific 10 Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Netter won the Pac-10 singles championship, upsetting Jared 
Palmer of two-time defending NCAA champion Stanford in the semifinals and 
another Stanford standout, Alex O'Brien, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Netter also won the Rolex regional tournament singles title in November, 
defeating Arizona's Scott Sigerseth in straight sets in the final. In March, he 
defeated Donny Isaak of USC to capture the championship of the Southern 
California Intercollegiate tournament. Netter's record in tournaments is 18-2. 
</P>
<P>
But in dual meets, he is only 8-14. Before capturing the Pac-10 title, he had 
lost six of eight dual matches and had dropped to No. 50 in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
In his past two outings, he lost both his singles matches as the Bruins won at 
home against Pepperdine, 5-3, and defeated UC Irvine, 6-3, on the road. He was 
defeated by Pepperdine's ninth-ranked David Wells-Roth, 2-6, 6-0, 6-4, and lost 
to Irvine's 20th-ranked Trevor Kronemann, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett, whose Bruins have won seven NCAA championships and 12 
conference crowns in 24 years, isn't sure how to explain the dichotomy between 
Netter's play in tournaments and in dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett said that in tournaments, "maybe (Netter) gets into the swing of 
things. In dual matches you play (only) every three or four days. It may be a 
matter of getting into rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
Netter struggled in his first match in the Pac-10 tournament against 
California's Matt Stroyman before winning, 6-1, 2-6, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Netter's match against Pepperdine's Wells-Roth on Friday was in some ways a 
capsule of his season. He was hot in the first set, cold in the second set and 
competitive in the third set before losing. 
</P>
<P>
When Pepperdine defeated the Bruins, 5-4, in Malibu in February, Wells-Roth won 
in straight sets. Last week Wells-Roth seemed to be trying to overpower Netter 
in the opening set, attempting to hit winners with every stroke. But he made a 
lot of unforced errors, and Netter picked him apart with his accurate base-line 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, it was Netter's turn to make mistakes, and Wells-Roth won 
six consecutive games. Netter battled back in the third set before losing, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gallien, Pepperdine co-coach, said that Netter "did not play well at 
all" in the second set and that his "concentration sort of wandered" in the 
third set. 
</P>
<P>
"If David had continued to play poorly, it probably would have gone Jason's 
way," Gallien said. 
</P>
<P>
Netter thinks he hasn't played better in dual matches because he has been 
bothered for about two years by tendinitis in his right shoulder. But he said 
that the only thing affected by the tendinitis was his serve and that he hasn't 
felt pain in the shoulder for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he thinks the tendinitis has been cured by treatment and exercise 
and that the shoulder has given him "no worries at all. I can go out and serve 
as hard as I want, and I've had no problems so far." 
</P>
<P>
Netter said he thinks other reasons for his up-and-down year might have been 
that he didn't play with much confidence and was not in the best physical shape 
at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gallien said that Netter's game demands that he be in top physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't win a lot of points with overheads and volleys," Gallien said. 
"He's not an attacker, which means that he's been playing a lot of long points. 
Over the course of the season that's quite a physical grind." 
</P>
<P>
Netter said the losses in dual matches have served a useful purpose. "Losing 
got me into better shape and got me to focus on tennis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Netter will focus on the NCAA team and individual championships, which begin 
May 18 at Indian Wells. He is a long shot to win a national singles title. The 
tournament favorites will be Todd Martin of Northwestern, Jose-Luis Noriega of 
the University of San Diego and Jonathan Stark of Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Stark, the nation's top-ranked freshman, did not play in the Pac-10 tournament 
because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Gallien thinks that Wells-Roth and Alejo Mancisidor, a Pepperdine freshman from 
Spain who is ranked 21st, should also be in the running for the NCAA singles 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever wins the (NCAA) individual title will be someone who is in great 
shape, I'll tell you that," Gallien said, alluding to the desert heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen," Bassett said. "A million people have a shot (at the 
title). It will be interesting to see how people can handle the heat -- and it 
will be hot."

THEIR COMMON BOND IS DEVOTION TO BODYSURFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Kulberg, Jeffrey (Q) Davies and Isabelle De Loys have backgrounds and 
cultures as different as shells on the beach, but they are drawn together by an 
affinity for bodysurfing. 
</P>
<P>
Kulberg, 27, who lives in Encinitas, is Southern California-born, raised and 
stereotyped. He went to San Diego State on a swimming scholarship but stayed 
for the parties. In between, he earned a degree in industrial engineering and 
now owns has his own contractor business. 
</P>
<P>
Davies, 33, who lives in La Costa, is from the Midwest. His family lived on 
farms before moving to El Cajon when he was a boy. At Grossmont High School and 
Grossmont Community College, he swam and played water polo and earned a 
swimming scholarship to the University of Denver. He now works as a 
special-sections coordinator for the San Diego Union. 
</P>
<P>
De Loys, 22, who lives in Oceanside, is new to the area -- new to the country, 
for that matter. She was born in Switzerland, raised in Brazil. She is studying 
art, English and U.S. culture at MiraCosta College. After her education, she 
wants to return to Brazil and get into advertising or graphic arts. 
</P>
<P>
These three do not know one another well; just by first names and faces. But, 
in bodysurfing, they share a common affection and fraternal spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Menas, organizer of the Pacific Beach Pro-Am held March 17-18, said, "We 
get together at these contests a few times a year, and it's mostly the same 
people every year. You don't really know too many people or what they do for a 
living, but you know they bodysurf. And that's all that seems to matter. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no other feeling in the world like being out in the water on a glassy 
morning. Totally smooth, totally free energy." 
</P>
<P>
For Keith Kulberg, playing in the water was always the attraction. It didn't 
matter whether it was sailing, diving, swimming, skiing or surfing -- so long 
as he got wet. 
</P>
<P>
His parents enjoyed sailing and water sports, so he became interested as well. 
He did just about everything recreationally there was to do in the water. And 
he began swimming competitively in American Athletic Union meets when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
He took an unplanned five-year hiatus from swimming when his family moved east 
to Temecula, but he picked it up again during his senior at Elsinore High. From 
there, Kulberg swam for two years at Fullerton Community College, and did well 
enough to earn a scholarship to San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
He swam at SDSU for a year -- he remembers shaving his head for the Western 
Athletic Conference Championships at Brigham Young University -- but the 
program was cut after that because of athletic department budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was kind of a joke," Kulberg said. "I felt like leaving. But I 
loved the school, so I decided to stay." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a good decision, he added. In 1985, he earned his degree, 
and, three years later, started Kulberg Homes. His first major project -- a 
57-unit housing development -- is nearing completion, and Kulberg has planned a 
bodysurfing vacation in Hawaii in May. 
</P>
<P>
Kulberg says bodysurfing "is more of a side thing." But his fourth-place finish 
in March's contest indicates otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hitting these competitions here and there, and trying all these new 
maneuvers that I picked up from some of the other guys. I decided to go back to 
the basics. And it seemed to work." 
</P>
<P>
Those basics were first taught by his father and nurtured when he worked as a 
lifeguard through college at beaches in Ventura, Goleta and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Kulberg said he's had some wild times out in the surf, but none compare to a 
trip he and a friend took to Catalina Island on a Hobie Cat in February, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a rule," Kulberg said. "Whoever wasn't steering, the other guy was in 
charge of beer and whiskey and photography." 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the trip from Long Beach to Catalina was relatively 
uneventful, taking about three hours, 45 minutes. But on the way back, 
conditions called for gale force winds and waves of 5 to 8 feet. 
</P>
<P>
It took just two hours, 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the crazy days, Kulberg added. But now it is time to settle down. He 
plans to marry Michelle Ruyle in August (the honeymoon will be on a boat, of 
course), continue building homes and competing in bodysurfing contests. 
</P>
<P>
Q Davies also got his introduction to bodysurfing through competitive swimming 
and lifeguarding. But his start was much later in life and a little less 
predictable than Kulberg's. 
</P>
<P>
Few kids from Moberly, Mo., grow up to be world-class bodysurfers. But that is 
what he has become after moving to El Cajon, via Illinois and then Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an 'inland goon' until I got out of high school," Davies said. "My first 
exposure to the ocean was when I started lifeguarding." 
</P>
<P>
Davies, who moved to Leucadia after high school, worked as a lifeguard in 
college. He didn't begin competing in bodysurfing until four years ago but has 
become one of the area's best. This spring in the Pacific Beach Pro-Am, he 
finished second, behind five-time world champion Mike Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the ocean, water played a big part in shaping Davies' life. 
</P>
<P>
"In Kansas, we had horses, pigs and chickens. We also had a river that was 
really happening for a kid." 
</P>
<P>
"He's been around water all his life," his mother, Betty, said. "That's always 
been a real love of his, and he's had some crazy things happen because of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Betty added, "If he had his way, he'd live on the water, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Davies' hair -- cut short and whitish because of his many hours in the pool -- 
was also legendary at Grossmont. His friends began calling him Q, because at 
6-foot-5 and skinny, they said he looked like a Q-tip. The name stuck. 
</P>
<P>
After his swimming career ended at the University of Denver, Davies transferred 
to SDSU, where he graduated with a degree in business marketing. His days as a 
lifeguard -- and his days of taking monthlong surfing safaris to Mexico -- 
would soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
"Lifeguarding was a lot of fun, but it wasn't the end of the line," he said. 
"And, now that I've grown up, I don't do those kinds of things anymore." 
</P>
<P>
While Kulberg and Davies treat bodysurfing as more of a weekend hobby, Isabelle 
De Loys grew up with the sport and gets into the surf nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
She began 11 years ago in Rio de Janeiro, after moving there from Switzerland 
at the age of 6. She came to the United States last August. 
</P>
<P>
Bodysurfing was the reason she moved here. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Isabelle and her twin sister, Marie-Claude, came to Oceanside for the 
annual World Championships in August. Isabelle finished second in her age 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, De Loys again flew back from Brazil, finished sixth and decided to 
move to Chicago with another sister to study English. Chicago was too cold, so 
she returned to to Oceanside and enrolled at MiraCosta, staying with friends 
she had met through bodysurfing. 
</P>
<P>
At this year's Pacific Beach contest she finished first, but there was only one 
other contestant because the contest is mainly for men. 
</P>
<P>
In Rio de Janeiro, bodysurfing is a big-time sport for the men -- most of the 
women take to body boards because they require less strength, De Loys said. 
</P>
<P>
But De Loys stuck to bodysurfing and was a champion there. She had sponsors -- 
among others, Pepsi -- and even organized a tournament before moving here. 
</P>
<P>
"I organized a contest in Brazil with 80 people," said De Loys. "It was good. 
We had music and aerobics on the beach. And there were a lot of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good experience, and my sister helped me too. If you love the sport, 
you want to do anything to help it. You feel good. You feel like you did 
something."

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: HERNANDEZ HIDEAWAY CHEERFULLY GREETS WEARY SOULS 
WITH HEAPING-FULL PLATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The host at Hernandez Hideaway greeted a late-arriving party on a Friday night 
with a sympathetic expression and a friendly, "So you survived another week, 
huh?" 
</P>
<P>
A quick glance made it clear that the room was filled with survivors, all of 
them happily digging into plates spread to the rims with beans, rice and any of 
the numerous Mexican-style dishes that over the years have helped Hernandez 
Hideaway to contend for the title of North County's worst-kept secret. And, 
although the restaurant hasn't yet hung out a "This burrito's for you" sign, it 
does seem to encourage a relaxed, end-of-the-week atmosphere every night. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's name was perhaps more accurate some years ago, tucked away on 
the shores of Lake Hodges. The drive to the lake now is a little less bucolic, 
but the restaurant's surroundings still remain rural and charming. If the time 
of the month is right, a post-dinner stroll near the moonlit waters of the lake 
is as refreshing as a second cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing on the menu will seem new to anyone acquainted with Southern 
California-style Mexican cooking, but the selection should seem a complete and 
even exhaustive survey of this cuisine. Several items are paired with a chile 
relleno, a dish for which the restaurant says it is famous, and among such 
combo plates are those starring a carne asada top sirloin, an unusual grilled 
quesadilla stuffed with cheese and shredded beef, a plump tamale and the house 
specialty, chicken enchiladas with sour cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Hideaway has been cooking this menu for years and gives less 
attention to some dishes than it ought. A guest who is a native Californian and 
a lifelong aficionado of this style of cooking pulled a tortilla chip out of 
the basket, gave it a thoughtful bite and said, "This leaves a lot to be 
desired." Both the red and green salsas passed muster, however, and the red 
salsa can serve duty as more than a dip for the complimentary chips; a big 
spoonful of it stirred into the fresh, chunky guacamole (another house special) 
brought the creamy mixture to life. 
</P>
<P>
Skipping through the first 10 items on the list brings one to the sour cream 
chicken enchilada. "No. 11 is our best seller, and you'll like it, too," said 
the waitress. The irresistible suggestion resulted in a high-piled plate being 
served in short order. The chicken was dry -- perhaps because it was towards 
the end of the dinner hour or perhaps because the kitchen makes this dish in 
such quantity -- but dry it was, and the sour cream sauce was hard to find. A 
request for more sauce brought a brimming bowlful, and it did add not only 
smoothness to the serving but a certain pleasant heat, thanks to the bits of 
chilies with which it was spiked. The chile relleno on the side offered an 
attractive, savory alternative to the rather austere fowl, the flavor robust 
yet sultry under its cloak of burnt umber-colored ranchero sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The tamale, stuffed with the same shredded beef that here turns up in the 
machaca and other dishes, was a straightforward and happy preparation, the 
savory meat nicely balanced against the soft dough and the mildly spicy sauce. 
As is the case with all entrees, the plate was more than generously garnished 
with good rice and smooth, savory beans topped with a bit of cheese; dinners 
also include a side of Mexican-style slaw, the cabbage dry and tangy and an 
excellent antidote to the richness and heat of many main courses. 
</P>
<P>
Other menu highlights include pork chile verde (which can be had by itself or 
transformed into burritos); chicken breasts simmered in ranchero sauce and 
bedded on rice; shrimp Vera Cruz; carne asada burritos; carnitas and steak 
ranchero. The dessert list offers several kinds of cheesecake, bunuelos and a 
thick, creamy and excellently flavored flan.

California salt-bush, cut a colorful swath across the history of the area. 
Eaton, a New York native and former Chicagoan, became the first non-Indian to 
settle in Encinitas when, in 1875, he staked out a homestead claim of 80 acres 
along the south side of San Marcos Slough, now known as Batiquitos Lagoon. The 
area was known at the time as Green Valley Canyon, but Eaton, ever the 
individualist, preferred a different designation -- Eatonville. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1800s, Eaton, a bachelor, was no longer alone in the area. Along 
with a few other intrepid settlers, a group of English spiritualists arrived, 
bringing with them a love of religious freedom and a penchant for Greek history 
and mythology. They renamed the town Leucadia -- Greek for "place of shelter, 
isle of paradise" -- after a tiny island off the coast of Greece. 
</P>
<P>
As the town grew, the English settlers, who called themselves the Leucadia Land 
&amp; Town Co., named all the streets after Greek gods and goddesses. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than a century later, Leucadia, now home to about 10,000 people, 
still offers its own version of paradise by the sea, a quiet beach town of 
young couples or affluent retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Living on tucked-away streets with names like Jupiter, Neptune and Olympus, in 
houses that seem to be carved from the thick, green avocado groves, the 
residents of Leucadia are a diverse, proud group. Since 1986, when the 
communities of Encinitas, Cardiff, Leucadia and Olivenhain were incorporated 
into the City of Encinitas, the people of Leucadia have been adjusting to their 
new lives as residents of a good-sized city while trying to maintain their 
local identity and flavor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're part of Encinitas in total," said Lloyd O'Connell, Leucadia resident and 
president of the Encinitas Historical Society, which before the incorporation 
was known as the Leucadia-Encinitas Historical Society. "But, regionally, we're 
Leucadia people. The ZIP code, 92024, is the same for Encinitas and Leucadia, 
but we can and do use Leucadia as our mailing address." 
</P>
<P>
Whether to Leucadia or Encinitas, it's the natural beauty of the white sand 
beaches and the sheer, breathtaking cliffs that seems to attract people. 
</P>
<P>
"We love the coast," said Geraldine O'Connell, Lloyd's wife. "We were here from 
1956 through 1958, then moved here to stay in 1960. Highway 101 was the only 
road up to Los Angeles, and the area was just so beautiful, with the beaches 
and the eucalyptus trees." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lucas, who lives on Hermes Avenue, was also drawn by the natural beauty and 
climate. A television communications teacher at Palomar College, he came to the 
Encinitas area 10 years ago but has spent the past four in Leucadia. 
</P>
<P>
"Leucadia in particular has a special beach atmosphere, and it's still 
affordable," he said. "It has a certain laid-back atmosphere, a kind of hippie 
quality that I find attractive. And, of course, I like being near the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Being near the beach is a prime consideration for the folks of Leucadia, as is 
the funky atmosphere, which is so casual that many of the residents aren't 
quite sure where Leucadia ends and the rest of Encinitas begins. Some people 
thought that Leucadia Boulevard, a main street that runs east-west through 
Leucadia, was the dividing line. Others opted for Encinitas Boulevard, which 
runs parallel to Leucadia Boulevard but about a mile and a half south. 
According to the City Planning Department, the line is actually at Union 
Street, about halfway between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the dividing line between Leucadia and Encinitas dates to the 
days of Nathan Eaton, when two other Civil War veterans, Thomas Rattan and John 
S. Pitcher, hired a surveyor named D. N. Sanford of San Diego to help them lay 
out the streets. James Benjamin Elliot, a section foreman for the railroad, 
arrived in the area shortly after Eaton. Using the Chinese workers from his 
work crew, he cleared out the native sagebrush and planted many of the 
eucalyptus trees that give the area some of its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Elliot, as he was known, was a kind of one-man Chamber of Commerce and 
booster club for the city. He even placed ads in the Eastern papers to attract 
residents and, when the Hammond family -- all 11 of them -- arrived from St. 
Louis, the population of Encinitas-Leucadia instantly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Hammonds were more than a little surprised when they stepped 
onto the platform that served as a station that day in February, 1883. Instead 
of the orange groves, wild grapes and the river that Elliot had advertised, 
they found a flat, dry land with nothing but sagebrush growing on it. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but the thriving town of about 200 that they expected turned out 
to be but four buildings -- the houses where Ben Elliot and his workers lived, 
and a store owned by Ruben Chaffin and his wife, Sue. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Hammonds, who had come to America from England only two years 
before, were a hearty bunch, and went on to become one of the most prominent 
families in the area's history. In fact, soon after their arrival, they 
homesteaded on 320 acres on the upper ridge of town, with a huge house exactly 
on the dividing line between Leucadia and Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the sleepy coastal hamlet is a microcosm of the Southern California 
life. Artists and real estate agents, surfers and small business owners all 
coexist in the quiet, small-town atmosphere. Trailer parks and inexpensive 
motels sit beside high-priced homes with ocean views and brand new condominium 
complexes with names like Pacific Cove and Beach Chalet. It has no sidewalks, 
shopping centers or major industries. 
</P>
<P>
Popular landmarks include Leucadia Roadside Park and the Encinitas Railroad 
Department. The park, which once served as an open air temple for the English 
spiritualist, is situated at the corner of Highway 101 and Leucadia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The depot was purchased during the early 1970s and moved to 510 North Highway 
101, where it stands today on the border of Encinitas and Leucadia. It now 
houses a restaurant and two small art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Buffered from Carlsbad, its exploding neighbor to the north, by Batiquitos 
Lagoon and with the privately owned Ecke flower farm along much of its eastern 
border, Leucadia simply seems to move at a slightly slower pace than the rest 
of the county.

NORTH COUNTY FINDS: IT'S SHOW TIME IN JULIAN AS WILDFLOWERS BLOSSOM; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: THE ANNUAL JULIAN WILDFLOWER SHOW HAS BEEN A FEATURED EVENT IN THE 
MOUNTAIN TOWN FOR 64 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This month, 83-year-old Lelah Porter will head out to the Julian countryside to 
gather the wildflowers that paint the landscape purple and gold. 
</P>
<P>
She has practiced this ritual for more than 25 years as one of the official 
pickers for the Julian wildflower show, which starts Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year there are different people who pick, but flowers stay flowers," 
Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the wildflower show has changed little during the 64 years of its 
existence, in part because Julian itself has resisted the hurried growth that 
has wiped out open space in other parts of North County. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Julian Women's Club pick the flowers and invite city folks to 
come up and see their harvest. Visitors will find a colorful smorgasbord of 
desert primrose, monkey flowers, tidytips, mountain iris, yellow gold fields, 
gooseberry, mountain dogwood and several hundred other species of wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
The week before the show, five or six pickers spend three days collecting 
flowers, covering five climate zones from the Borrego desert to the 
mountaintops of Julian. 
</P>
<P>
Each spring brings a different mix of flowers depending on the weather. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising. Sometimes you find flowers in different locations where 
you've never seen them before," said Mildred Redding, a Julian resident since 
1935. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the image that flower-picking might carry and the age of some of the 
people who do it, making it as an official Julian picker requires stamina and 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun, but it's work," said Redding, who is in her 80s. "We do a lot of 
hiking. Sometimes the wind's blowing, and we have to be careful not to step on 
rattlesnakes or poison ivy. We have to watch where we put our hands so we don't 
get bit by a rattler. We kind of shake the bush so the snakes have time to 
escape." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, over the years the pickers have developed their own sort of lore as 
well as intimate knowledge of land that most of the public never sees, 
knowledge that gets passed down to the next generation of pickers. Redding, a 
picker for 20 years, taught her daughters and grandsons how to pick. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a seasoned picker will be paired with a newcomer to show her the 
ropes. Those who imagine a romantic romp through flower fields are quickly 
disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
"We start out by telling them to wear good stout boots, because they'll be 
walking through cow fields and crawling under barbed wire fence and over 
fences," said Marion Moore, 55, a picker for 14 years. "We teach them not to 
pick everything in sight, to be selective. 
</P>
<P>
"One time I was out picking with a woman and she asked, 'Is this squaw bush or 
poison ivy?' I was busy in a different corner of the field so I wasn't really 
paying attention. Later, I discovered she'd picked a whole arm full of poison 
ivy. I haven't heard the end of it yet." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other things they must know: Just the perfect stage of blossom so 
that the wildflowers will be in full bloom during the show. That means picking 
buds just on the verge of blossoming. 
</P>
<P>
They also must know how much to pick, never picking a patch bare. And, although 
they share much of their knowledge, Moore said, "if we find something really 
special, we don't tell anybody where we found it." 
</P>
<P>
Once picked, the wildflowers are wrapped in dry newspaper. Wet paper steams 
them. 
</P>
<P>
When they get back into town, they clip the bottom of the stems and put the 
flowers in a solution of water, plant food and sugar. Redding insists it's the 
sugar that "gives them extra pep." 
</P>
<P>
"You learn through the years how to keep the flowers fresh," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for identifying the blooms by their common names and placing them in 
buckets, members do little to improve on nature. 
</P>
<P>
The pickers never know what blooms will pop up. Each year is different. 
</P>
<P>
"With the season's late rain, we'll have wonderful mountain flowers, but the 
rain came too late for the desert," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Scouring the pastures and hills for flowers becomes a kind of treasure hunt. 
Each delights in finding a rare or favorite bloom. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my favorites is the fairy lantern," Redding said. "It's a little white 
flower that looks like a little lantern. When the petals fall off, the seeds 
look like lanterns, too." 
</P>
<P>
Some prefer to pick in the desert, others in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a thrill finding something unusual, like a snowdrop bush, or a flower we 
hadn't seen the year before that we thought had disappeared," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
But the pickers don't pretend to be botanists. Although they can identify most 
flowers by their common name, a few blooms leave them baffled. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we come across flowers we can't recognize. If we can't name it, we 
just put a question mark on it and someone's sure to tell us," Redding said. 
</P>
<P>
Botany students and teachers from Palomar College who come to the show help 
identify the mystery buds. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone will say, 'That's an Indian Paint Brush' and another person will call 
it something else," Moore said. "Each year, some names get changed. We leave 
the name up until we're proven wrong." 
</P>
<P>
All of the flowers in the show are indigenous to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very fussy about everything being wild. No tulips or cultivated flowers 
allowed," Redding said. 
</P>
<P>
Women's club members hope the show will help people to identify flowers when 
they're hiking and expose them to rare varieties they otherwise wouldn't see. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits people from picking wildflowers in public parks, so the 
pickers obtain permits from private landowners to pick flowers on their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Porter, who has watched development creep into Julian, worries that the pickers 
one day won't be able to reach the rarer flowers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT: Julian Wildflower and Fine Arts Show. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday-May 20. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE: Julian Town Hall, at Main and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
NOTES: Both events are sponsored by the Julian Chamber of Commerce. The fine 
arts show, managed by the Julian Arts Guild, features paintings, ceramics and 
sculptures by local artists for disfgay and for sale. The 64th annual 
wildflower show, presented by the Julian Women's Club, displays and identifies 
several hundred varieties of local wildflowers.

1ST MCMARTIN CHILD WITNESS BALKS; 
</P>
<P>
GIRL, 11, RESUMES TESTIMONY, SAYS SHE CAN'T REMEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
The first child witness in the retrial of McMartin Pre-School molestation 
defendant Ray Buckey balked at resuming her testimony today and finally 
testified that she could not remember anything. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old girl had testified only a short time today when she left the 
witness stand complaining of a stomach ache. Prosecutors conceded that she did 
not want to testify further. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Pam Ferrero said the 11-year-old girl's parents called her 
Wednesday night saying the child was "extremely reluctant" to return for more 
questioning. But the parents agreed to bring her anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrero told Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg that the girl expressed the 
same desire not to testify when she arrived at court today but "was trying to 
be cheerful" and agreed to take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
But when Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, resumed cross-examination, the girl 
appeared uncomfortable. She was on the stand 10 minutes, answering intimate 
questions about her body, when she suddenly announced, "May I be excused? I 
have a stomach ache." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later she was observed in the hallway sobbing in her father's arms as 
he tried to comfort her. 
</P>
<P>
The judge recessed court to give her time to compose herself and said he would 
take further action if that became impossible. 
</P>
<P>
After about an hour of private talks with prosecutors, the child was escorted 
back into the courtroom and returned to the witness stand. Her father was 
allowed to stand next to her and she clutched a stuffed toy. 
</P>
<P>
However, as she began to testify she answered every question regarding her past 
allegations of sexual misconduct at the school by saying, "I can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Buckey is charged specifically with raping the girl and using a 
foreign object to sodomize her. 
</P>
<P>
The first Buckey trial, the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. 
history, ended in January with Buckey acquitted of 40 counts of molestation at 
the family-owned preschool in Manhattan Beach. His mother, Peggy McMartin 
Buckey, was acquitted of 12 charges. But the jury deadlocked on 13 counts 
against Buckey, and the district attorney decided to retry him on eight of 
those charges involving three children. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous children in the first trial testified about a "naked movie star game" 
allegedly played at the McMartin school. The current witness made the same 
claim, saying she and other children took off their clothes for the game and 
were photographed nude by Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities made extensive searches but found no such photographs. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination Wednesday, the girl told Davis that her memory was 
vague because "I tried to put the people at the preschool out of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
"Who molested you?" Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Just Ray I think," the girl said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did the lady teachers molest you?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember," she said.

Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) today described as "complete lies" a claim by a 
prostitute that he knew a brothel was being operated from his Capitol Hill 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told Cable News Network on Wednesday night that she worked for the 
prostitution ring operated by Stephen Gobie, a male prostitute and former 
acquaintance of Frank. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was not identified by CNN. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's relationship with Gobie is the subject of an investigation by the House 
ethics committee, which is trying to decide how to handle charges that the 
congressman associated with the male prostitute from 1985 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, in a statement, said, "Reports by a female prostitute -- who first 
surfaced as part of Mr. Gobie's deal with Penthouse magazine -- are complete 
lies, fabricated stories about events which did not happen."

China today freed 211 prisoners linked to last year's democracy protests, in 
what Western diplomats saw as an attempt to ease tension ahead of the 
anniversary of the army's bloody crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats also said the release of the prisoners, including several 
prominent dissidents, was aimed at boosting China's battered image abroad and 
deflecting a campaign to withdraw most-favored-nation trade status by the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency said 211 "law breakers" involved in last 
year's political unrest had been released.

Reader's Digest Assn. Inc. today reported a 7% profit decline in the third 
fiscal quarter despite a 9.5% jump in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The publishing and direct-mail concern, based in Pleasantville, N.Y., said net 
income in the quarter ended March 31 totaled $59.3 million, or 50 cents a 
share, down from $64.1 million, or 54 cents a share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the decline to a higher effective tax rate and a 
non-recurring $13.1-million expense associated with the appreciation of stock 
incentives offered to senior managers and editors. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the charge, net income would have totaled about $67 million.

Car dealer Freddye (Action) Jackson says he's baffled by the uproar over his 
offer of special discounts to fellow Christians. 
</P>
<P>
But the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith says the problem is clear: 
Jackson's 9-month-old incentive program discriminates, even though it also is 
available to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you talk about Christianity, people blow it out of proportion; people 
take it negatively. I don't know why," Jackson said. 
</P>

He started the Christian Members Buyers Plan at Brown Lincoln-Mercury in this 
Washington suburb last August. But the uproar started when a local newspaper

<P>
Toyota Motor Corp. denied today that it tried to prevent Texas oilman T. Boone 
Pickens from placing ads in local newspapers in his battle to assert ownership 
rights in a Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
But several of Tokyo's largest newspapers said they held up the ads, which 
claim that collusive business practices force higher prices on consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The papers said they were considering printing a version that omits company 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no freedom of speech in Japan," said Pickens' lawyer, Kanji Ishizumi. 
"Toyota published an ad in a U.S. paper saying 'shut up' to Pickens. They were 
able to enjoy freedom of speech in the United States, but Pickens can't do that 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Pickens issued a statement Wednesday in Texas claiming that Toyota and its 
powerful advertising agency, Dentsu, were trying to block him from publishing 
the ads. 
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Boone Co., a U.S. investment firm, has held the largest equity 
stake in Koito Manufacturing Co., a major auto parts maker closely linked to 
Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens says his unsuccessful battle to gain a seat on Koito's board of 
directors and to exercise leadership in the firm illustrates how investment 
opportunities are closed to foreigners in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Pickens ad is addressed to consumers, auto parts employees and shareholders 
of Koito.

Israel's Supreme Court today ordered the state attorney general to reopen an 
investigation into whether criminal charges should be lodged against the 
nation's leading banks and former directors for a stock market crash in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling threatens to shake up Israel's banking system, which already is 
burdened by 20% annual inflation and economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 26 banks, directors and accountants could be put on trial for violating 
state banking regulations, the national Itim news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
These include eight major institutions: Bank Leumi, Bank Hapoalim, Israel 
Discount Bank and its holding company IDB, Union Bank, Bank Mizrahi, Israel 
General Bank and the Bank for Trade and Funding. 
</P>
<P>
The market collapse of October, 1983, was one of Israel's worst economic 
disasters, forcing the government to underwrite hundreds of millions of dollars 
in public losses that are still being paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Israel radio estimated the bailout cost $8 billion.

The nation's No. 1 supplier of laboratory mice is up to 70% capacity after a 
fire one year ago today that dealt a blow to medical research projects around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze at Jackson Laboratory killed 400,000 mice and destroyed much of the 
29-year-old breeding complex. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is counting on at least $10 million from the National Institutes of 
Health for a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be at 85% by the end of this summer. And we'll be at 100% by the end of 
1991 if we get the $10 million from NIH," said Director Kenneth Paigen, who was 
about to assume the post when the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
JAX mice, as they are known in the scientific community, are used in research 
on cancer, AIDS, diabetes, arthritis and thousands of hereditary diseases. 
</P>

The research center, using frozen embryos, can breed mice of 1,700 strains to

The Art Institute of Chicago is putting 11 works on the auction block, 
including paintings by Monet, Picasso, Modigliani, Utrillo and Degas, to raise 
the $12-million purchase price of a bronze sculpture, "Golden Bird," by 
Constantin Brancusi. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Institute, which in the past has resisted selling works to purchase 
others, is making an exception in this case, the Chicago Sun-Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"To let the Brancusi leave is unthinkable," Director James N. Wood said. "The 
work is seminal to Chicago's reputation as a center for modern art." 
</P>
<P>
The Brancusi is owned by the Art Club of Chicago, which is selling it to buy a 
new gallery for its other works. Wood said the Art Institute already has 
possession of the sculpture and is committed to paying $8 million by the end of 
June and $4 million more over the next 10 years.

EXTRA BREAKAGE IN EASTWOOD MOVIE STUNT

<TEXT>
<P>
A department store window was accidentally shattered by an explosion a block 
away during the filming of a Clint Eastwood movie stunt in which a luxury car 
hurtles from an upper window of a downtown building, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery blast accompanying the 11 p.m. stunt Wednesday shattered a window of 
Robinson's department store at 600 W. 7th St., about a block from the vacant 
warehouse near Eighth and Figueroa streets in which the stunt was done, Sgt. 
Jim Leinen said. 
</P>
<P>
The stunt otherwise went as planned without any injuries, but it set off 
burglar alarms, Leinen said. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of the stunt shows the car smashing through the top floor window of 
the 5-story building and flying through the air before it smashed onto hay 
bales on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the car was airborne outside the building, a gigantic blast ripped 
through the fifth floor. A freeze frame of the video showed the flying car 
framed by a fireball. Fire erupted on several floors of the building, but was 
soon put out, an eyewitness said. 
</P>
<P>
Leinen said the stunt was staged for the Warner Bros. film, "The Rookie," 
starring Clint Eastwood. The car, which Leinen said was a Mercedes Benz 500 SL, 
was unoccupied. The film crew re-staged the stunt about 1:45 a.m., Leinen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It went as it was intended to," he said of the original stunt. "It was 
supposed to be a fiery blaze and a tremendous blast. I think they just got one 
too many windows."

Architect Maya Ying Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 
Washington, D.C., when she was a Yale student, has returned to her alma mater 
to mark the arrival of women undergraduates 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yale has commissioned Lin to design a sculpture to celebrate new generations of 
Yale women on campus, culminating a yearlong observance of the 20th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The monument "is more about the future than commemorating the past," Lin said 
this week, and likely will include places where "people can sit and enjoy 
themselves." She would not discuss possible designs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 as a senior, Lin's design was chosen from 1,420 entries for the Vietnam 
memorial, a black granite work inscribed with the names of 58,000 Americans 
killed or missing. It is the most visited monument in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Lin also designed a monument to those slain during the civil rights movement. 
The work was dedicated in Montgomery, Ala., in November.

33-year-old Navratilova managed to defeat Italy's Sandra Cecchini 6-4, 3-6, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario took a 4-2 lead in the first set before giving up four 
consecutive games and the set to Kelesi. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario repeated itself in the second set, as Sanchez-Vicario, 18, 
squandered leads of 4-2 and 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"After I fell behind 4-2 in the first set, I just told myself to relax, and to 
start getting ready for the second," said Kelesi, seeded 11th. "And I started 
playing better." 
</P>
<P>
"I really needed this win today. I played Arantxa twice this year and lost both 
times. I knew that if I lost today, it would be a long time before I beat her 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario said that fatigue had been a factor in the loss. "I think I've 
played too many tournaments in a row," she said. "After seven tournaments this 
year, I'm tired. I gave it everything I had today. I attacked on the important 
points. But my shots kept going long. I guess it just wasn't my day." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, who wore a bandage around her left thigh, said the hamstring 
injury bothered her on some points. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get down on some volleys and low balls. But it's better than 
yesterday so I'm encouraged," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other seeded teen-agers, 16-year-old Monica Seles and 19-year-old defending 
champion Gabriela Sabatini also reached the quarters. Seles beat Mercedes Paz 
6-1, 6-1 and the fourth-seeded Sabatini eliminated Regina Rajchrtova 6-0, 6-1.

STEER CLEAR OF SPORT LOTTERIES, VINCENT WARNS

<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent has warned jurisdictions seeking major league 
expansion franchises to stay away from sports lotteries, igniting a controversy 
whose effects may be felt well beyond Washington. 
</P>
<P>
As District Councilman Frank Smith Jr., chairman of the D.C. Baseball 
Commission, put in writing his opposition to the proposed betting game, Lottery 
Board Chairman Carolyn B. Lewis said the board has not considered including 
baseball in the Sports Pool Lottery it recently gave preliminary approval. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.) said he would introduce a bill this week 
that would prohibit state-run sports-betting enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The developments came a day after Vincent said, "Jurisdictions which engage in 
sports betting and which are also seeking expansion franchises should be warned 
that, at least, I will tend to consider those two things together." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Lottery Board approved the rules for a game that would allow 
legal gambling in the District of Columbia on professional football, baseball, 
basketball and hockey. The game, which still must receive formal approval from 
the District's Office of the Corporation Counsel and final approval from the 
lottery board, likely would begin in September when the National Football 
League regular season opens. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis said that since the Lottery Board began considering the Sports Pool 
Lottery in 1987, football is the only sport that has been discussed for the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball "has not ever been under consideration," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she would support any kind of sports lottery if she knew it could 
adversely affect Washington's chances of being awarded a baseball franchise, 
Lewis said the Lottery Board has yet to make a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
That decision will not come until at least the completion of a 30-day period 
for public comment. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Lottery Board Executive Director Lorraine Greene, Smith 
requested "that the Lottery Board not consider creating a sports-betting 
lottery system at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"A sports betting lottery would . . . give Major League Baseball an avenue by 
which they can deny Washington, D.C., a baseball team," wrote Smith, who 
Tuesday raised the possibility of council action against a sports lottery.

The Clippers have been denied permission to discuss their vacant head coaching 
job with Cleveland Cavaliers coach Lenny Wilkens, a spokesman for the Clippers 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkens just completed his fourth season as the Cavaliers' head coach and has 
one year remaining on his contract. The Cavaliers were beaten three games to 
two in their best-of-five first-round NBA playoff series by the Philadelphia 
76ers earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers announced on April 22, the day the NBA regular season was 
completed, that Don Casey wouldn't be back next season as the team's head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were 30-52 this season, their best record since they went 32-50 in 
1985-86.

AFTER LOCKOUT, NO WALKOUT BY FANS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FRUSTRATION AND ANGER APPARENTLY DIDN'T LAST LONG AFTER DELAYED 
SPRING TRAINING. ATTENDANCE IS CLIMBING AT A RATE THAT WOULD SET ANOTHER MAJOR 
LEAGUE RECORD THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Baseball fans have recovered quickly from the anger and frustration they 
displayed during the owners' 32-day spring-training lockout. They are attending 
games at a rate that would set a major league attendance record for a sixth 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Though 15 of the 26 clubs reported a decline in attendance through Sunday, 
overall major league attendance increased slightly. It was up by 47,133, or 
0.6%, over 309 dates as compared with the same number of dates last year. Major 
league clubs drew a record 55,173,096 fans last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Given everything, I'm pleased with the numbers," Commissioner Fay Vincent said 
by telephone from Washington. "Attendance is up and that's despite numerous 
doubleheaders and bad weather. I don't think the lockout caused any effect on 
attendance. I didn't think it would, not since my first day in spring training 
and the response I heard from the fans. They were glad to have baseball back." 
</P>
<P>
Said New York Mets Vice President Al Harazin: "I don't doubt there are a few 
people out there who are teed off because of the lockout. But I don't see that 
in terms of macro numbers. There just aren't enough of them to show up in the 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
American League attendance is up by 252,788. Virtually all of that increase is 
attributable to the Toronto Blue Jays, who are playing their first full season 
at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
National League attendance is down by 205,675. Much of that can be blamed on 
the Mets, who have suffered the biggest decline in attendance of any major 
league team. 
</P>
<P>
"As I read the numbers, the American League has been helped by Toronto being so 
powerful," Vincent said. "They weren't playing in the SkyDome at this time last 
year. The National League has been hurt by the Mets, who are traditionally one 
of the biggest draws, so I wouldn't worry about that. They've had some bad 
weather. I know; I've sat through some of their games." 
</P>
<P>
Here is how each California team's 1990 attendance, through Sunday, compares 
with its 1989 attendance through the same number of dates: 
</P>
<P>
Dodgers -59,353 
</P>
<P>
Angels +103,090 
</P>
<P>
Oakland +74,833 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco +47,032 
</P>
<P>
San Diego +8,935 
</P>
<P>
Through Monday's games, Mets pitchers Frank Viola, Dwight Gooden and David Cone 
ranked 1-2-3 among the National League strikeout leaders. Only once before have 
three teammates finished a season in that order. That was in 1961, when Dodger 
pitchers Sandy Koufax (269), Stan Williams (205) and Don Drysdale (182) 
completed the trifecta. 
</P>
<P>
That Dodgers staff produced three current major league pitching coaches 
(Williams of Cincinnati, Larry Sherry of San Francisco and Ron Perranoski of 
Los Angeles) and one manager (Roger Craig of San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
There have been only 20 cases when teammates finished 1-2 (without ties) in 
their league in strikeouts, most recently in 1987 when Nolan Ryan and Mike 
Scott of Houston did it. In only eight of those 20 cases did the club with the 
two strikeout leaders finish in first place. 
</P>
<P>
Expos Manager Buck Rodgers recently wrote an article for one of Montreal's 
French newspapers, titled, "The Story Behind Mound Searches." He was asked to 
write the article after he ordered umpires to check Houston pitcher Dave Smith 
and then the Astros countered by ordering them to search Expos pitcher Dennis 
Martinez. But the pitcher Rodgers most incriminated was the Yankees' Pascual 
Perez, who formerly pitched for Rodgers in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers made one reference to the hair gel Perez uses. Then he wrote, "To come 
back to my friend Pascual, who so many managers suspected (of doctoring the 
baseball), let's say I never directly asked him the question. If I don't know 
something, I don't have to lie when I talk about it. Sometimes ignorance is 
bliss. 
</P>
<P>
"But according to my own observations, if he came back into the National 
League, I would be the first guy to have him checked."

RESEARCHERS REVIVE LASIX CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1973 Maryland racing fans began to observe phenomena that seemed to defy all 
logic. Some horses were improving, from one race to another, by 10 or 20 
lengths. Fainthearted horses who had tired in sprints suddenly found the 
stamina to win distance races. The horses performing these miracles came from 
only a few stables, however. Only a few trainers possessed the magic power to 
transform thoroughbreds overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Later we learned these trainers didn't have magic; they had Lasix. The 
diuretic, originally intended for human use, had made its way to the track and 
it sharply improved the performance of certain horses -- particularly those 
with respiratory problems. Its illicit use became so flagrant in Maryland, and 
gave such an advantage to the trainers who had access to it, that the state 
racing commission finally bowed to horsemen's demands and allowed it. 
</P>
<P>
That was the beginning of the Lasix era in U.S. racing. The medication was 
approved in state after state, after the pleading of horsemen and the assurance 
of veterinarians that it was a benign, therapeutic drug that wouldn't alter 
horses' form. 
</P>
<P>
The horsemen's lobbying always was strong enough to override questions from 
members of the betting public, who had observed the form reversals that Lasix 
induced, but who had no political voice. The pro-medication forces were such a 
steamroller that Lasix had been entrenched for a decade before the industry 
undertook the first serious scientific study of its effects. 
</P>
<P>
The results of that study, commissioned by the Jockey Club and conducted by the 
prestigious University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, were made 
public Monday. The study confirmed what bettors have taken for granted: The 
drug makes horses run faster. In the study, horses who were not bleeders, and 
therefore had no need for the drug's therapeutic effects, improved by an 
average of two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning part of the study was its finding that Lasix isn't terribly 
effective in helping bleeders. A high percentage of the horses treated with 
Lasix were found after a race to have blood in their trachea anyway -- the very 
condition Lasix was approved to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
These conclusions do not necessarily mean that the question of whether to keep 
Lasix legal is an open-and-shut case. I have played the horses extensively in 
California (where medication policies are very liberal) and in New York (where 
all drugs are forbidden) and I see plenty of ambiguities in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
On half the days I have spent at Santa Anita, the air quality has been so bad 
that the nearby San Gabriel Mountains have been rendered invisible. I find 
myself hacking, coughing, sniffling even when I am sitting quietly in the 
grandstand. Under such conditions, does it make sense to deny a racehorse 
respiratory aid, even if it only helps some of the horses some of the time? 
Californians overwhelmingly favor their Lasix program, and I rarely have seen 
form reversals by horses to suggest it is being abused. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, there is no racing area in the country that generates so many 
justifiable suspicions about improper drug use as New York does. The prevailing 
attitude among some trainers may be that if they can't use allowed drugs, they 
might as well use prohibited ones. 
</P>
<P>
What the University of Pennsylvania study does demonstrate, however, is that 
the assurances given to state racing commissions by horsemen and veterinarians 
were false. It has exposed the dishonesty, the shortsightedness and the greed 
of those people in the racing industry who championed Lasix in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
In every country but the United States, the prescribed cure for bleeding is 
rest. But here, trainers and owners argue that the demands of year-round racing 
necessitate the help of medication to keep the horses going. In other words, 
they don't want to expend the time and money needed to give a horse a rest when 
a needle might do the job for them. 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians rushed to their support, extolling the virtues of Lasix, but 
their motives might generate cynicism too. Diagnosing bleeders and treating 
them with Lasix every time they run is a steady and significant source of 
income for race track vets. A Canadian journalist wrote that asking vets if 
horses should race on Lasix "is like polling kids to see if they would like 
more candy." 
</P>
<P>
What was most troubling about the movement to permit Lasix was that horsemen 
and vets were so narrowly concerned about their economic interests and so 
little concerned about the betting public or the perceptions of the public at 
large. As they whitewashed the issue, they argued that there was no need to 
inform the public about who was getting Lasix and who wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as the mid-1980s horses could run in the Kentucky Derby with no 
public disclosure of whether they were being treated with medication. And even 
today bettors can only guess whether horses shipping from one state to another 
were given Lasix in their last race. 
</P>
<P>
Even more serious, however, is the perception of outsiders that horse racing is 
an inhumane sport in which the participants are drugged. The current issue of 
the Thoroughbred Times addresses this image question by quoting a Humane 
Society lobbyist who is leading an anti-medication charge in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"Horse racing," Antonia Russo said, "is carrying a ticking time bomb by failing 
to address . . . the drugging of horses. The industry is conducting an all-out 
campaign to recruit new fans and a younger audience (but) with increased 
concern with animal treatment in America, it is just a matter of time before 
horse racing becomes an animal rights issue. . . . If the industry cannot 
afford to race horses without medicating them, . . . then it will not survive. 
The public will not support it as a sport." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the University of Pennsylvania study isn't going to resolve the 
medication issue in America. It will enable the people who oppose the use of 
Lasix to counter the arguments of the horsemen and veterinarians. And it surely 
will harden their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But initial reactions from horsemen indicate that few of them have been swayed 
by this report. They insist that Lasix is such an effective and important 
medication that any curbs on its use would be a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years after it began, the controversy over Lasix is about to start 
all over again.

<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: RYAN KARP IS WILLING TO DRIVE 45 MINUTES EACH DAY FROM HIS 
PARENTS' BEVERLY HILLS HOME TO PLAY BASEBALL FOR HARBOR COLLEGE.

<P>
Just call Ryan Karp Mr. Versatility. In two seasons on Harbor College's 
powerful baseball team, he has been successful on the mound, at the plate, in 
the outfield and the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Karp has also made a big geographical adjustment, going from a high school in 
affluent Beverly Hills to a community college in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to tease me a lot about it," Karp said. "The Beverly Hills boy in 
Harbor. It really used to bother me, but not anymore. I just want to play 
college baseball and get an education." 
</P>
<P>
Karp drives 45 minutes daily from his parents' Beverly Hills home to be part of 
Harbor's successful baseball program. It has proven to be a worthwhile effort 
for the 20-year-old, who has earned the praise of Seahawk Coach Jim O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"If we make it all the way to the state finals," O'Brien said, "he can play 
first base in one game, center field in the next game, and he can pitch in the 
last game. He can play all three with no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Last season Karp was an All-American center fielder and a .377 hitter on a 
Harbor team that went 33-17 and placed third at the state tournament in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
This year, starting at first base, he's still a top hitter (.345) on an even 
stronger Seahawk club that clinched its fifth consecutive conference title. 
Karp and freshman Erik Russell are tied for second on the team in home runs 
with five each. 
</P>
<P>
As a pitcher, Karp, a left-hander, is 3-0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws hard," O'Brien said. "He's got a good moving fastball and a pretty 
good curve ball. He's also got a great change-up." 
</P>
<P>
Hitting, however, seems to be his forte. Karp ripped a couple of home runs over 
the right-field fence in Harbor's 10-2 win over Mission on April 19. The 
victory gave the Seahawks their 11th conference title since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The first homer, in the bottom of the fourth inning, gave the top-ranked 
Seahawks a 3-0 lead, and the second gave them a 6-0 edge in the bottom of the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Karp followed his back-to-back homers with an RBI double to deep left in the 
bottom of the seventh. A professional baseball scout, who doesn't want to be 
identified because Karp is under control by the Houston Astros, said he's 
impressed by the young athlete's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him pitch in the winter," the scout said as he watched Karp take the 
field, "and I thought he had a great chance as a pitcher. He can also swing the 
bat real well. He has a real good body, and the more he develops, the better 
he'll get." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-4 and 195 pounds, Karp has impressed many with his powerful hitting 
and pitching. After last season he was drafted by the Astros, who own his 
rights until June. 
</P>
<P>
But unless he gets an extraordinary pro offer, Karp wants to play college ball 
and get a degree in accounting. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month he signed a letter of intent with the University of Miami, a 
powerhouse Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
Miami has plans for Karp as a hitter and pitcher, though Turtle Thomas, the 
Hurricanes' baseball recruiting coordinator, said Monday that he wouldn't 
comment on individual recruits until the entire recruiting class signs. 
</P>
<P>
"The information on all our recruits will be released in an article in the 
Miami Herald in a couple of weeks," Thomas said. "I wish I could tell you a lot 
of good things about him, but I can't at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
Karp picked Miami because he likes hot, humid weather and he has relatives 
there. The sophomore was also recruited by major programs such as Texas A &amp; 
M and Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Being pursued by big schools was a change for Karp, who had few options a 
couple of years ago. He had virtually nowhere to go after graduating from 
Beverly Hills High, where he played baseball, basketball and football. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get lots of attention in high school," Karp said. "Beverly Hills is 
not known for its athletes or good athletics. They think the kids from Beverly 
Hills don't want it as bad. Well . . . I want it just as bad." 
</P>
<P>
After high school, Karp went to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in hopes of earning a 
starting spot on the baseball team. He left after one quarter because his 
chances of making the cut looked grim. He transferred to Harbor in the spring 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even going to play (at San Luis Obispo)," Karp said. "I wasn't going 
to make varsity." 
</P>
<P>
The bench was an unfamiliar position for the three-sport letterman from Beverly 
Hills. As a high school senior, he had led the Normans to the semifinals of the 
CIF 5-A baseball playoffs with powerful hitting and consistent pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Karp still holds school records for most home runs (nine) and RBIs (49) in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Karp's success, however, Beverly Hills Coach Bill Erickson said there 
are several reasons why he wasn't highly recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just started growing physically," Erickson said. "He was a skinny, 
awkward kid who hadn't matured into his body until the end of his senior year. 
Another shortcoming is that he wasn't as competitive as we felt he should be. 
He was not as confident in himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I see a totally different person. He's much more confident. He's a hell of 
a lot stronger, and he's much more determined. He also plays a lot harder. 
Going to Harbor is the best thing that could have happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
It's also one of the best things that could have happened to the playoff-bound 
Seahawks, who wrapped up their regular season with an impressive 41-5 record 
(19-0 in the Southern California Athletic Conference). 
</P>
<P>
Despite having a deep and talented pitching staff, O'Brien said Karp has a good 
chance of pitching in the playoffs, which begin Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Karp likes the idea. "I'd really love to," he said, smiling. "I like pitching 
because I have control of the game. I'd have to say pitching is my favorite." 
</P>
<P>
But it really doesn't matter where he plays, as long as he contributes to the 
Seahawks' quest to capture a third state title in O'Brien's 15 years at Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like doing it all," Karp said. "I just love playing baseball."

BALLET: ASKOLD MAKAROV WAS ALREADY IN TOWN WHEN THE LENINGRAD STATE BALLET HAD 
TO CANCEL ITS SHOW, SO HE'S STAYING ON TO OFFER HIS DANCE EXPERTISE.

<P>
Just because the Leningrad State Ballet had to cancel its May 12 show here 
doesn't mean Soviet dance won't leave some imprint. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very disappointed," said Maxine Mahon of the California Ballet. "Eight 
Russian dancers were going to work with us, and it was a terrible blow to us 
artistically when it all fell through. It was all I could do to keep from 
hitting rock bottom, but I realized I had better salvage something from it. You 
can't dwell on disappointment. We're professionals. We have to make something 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
The saving grace came in the person of Askold Makarov, artistic director of the 
Leningrad-based ballet troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Because Makarov was already in San Diego by the time the decision to ditch the 
concert was made, Mahon asked him to stay on and teach the local dancers some 
Soviet repertory works. (A copyright conflict over the "Jakobson Choreographic 
Miniatures," the centerpiece of the performance, caused the cancellation.) 
</P>
<P>
"He agreed to teach us 'La Bayadere' ('Kingdom of the Shades'), and the pas de 
trois from 'Swan Lake' -- the Kirov version," she noted, "as well as 
(variations from) 'Humpback Horse,' a ballet based on a very old Russian folk 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be getting any of the Jakobson pieces, of course," said Mahon, "but 
to have 'Bayadere' in your repertory is an important legacy." 
</P>
<P>
Mahon conceded, however, that it may be some time before the grass-roots 
organization can put a proper "Bayadere" on stage, because of its difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"Our leads (Denise Dabrowski, Karen Evans, and Sylvia Poolos) are very good, 
but the 16 corps dancers are not experienced enough. They need time to work on 
</P>
<P>
it." 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday afternoon, with the temperature at the studio soaring above the 
90-degree mark, Makarov and the dancers were doing just that. The Soviet 
director conducted a grueling teaching session, while a videotaped version of 
the Petipa masterpiece (danced by the celebrated Kirov dancers) accompanied the 
class to coax the overworked dancers on to greater heights. 
</P>
<P>
"Up, up, up," the Soviet director shouted, using one of the few words of 
English he has picked up during his stay. "Brava Denise," he told Dabrowski, 
when she managed a magnificent combination. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a business suit and tie despite melt-down temperatures, Makarov used 
mimed gestures to communicate his corrections. Then, shedding the coat and tie, 
he joined the ensemble to demonstrate the moves, humming the music for 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand a word he's saying," said Mahon, while Makarov delivered an 
animated speech. "But as a director, I see the same mistakes, so I can figure 
out what he's telling them. He doesn't need an interpreter when he's teaching, 
most of the time, because we all use French terms." 
</P>
<P>
"Good," Makarov boomed, over and over, as the rehearsal heated up. By then, 
Dabrowski, the troupe's reigning ballerina, was looking haggard from heat and 
exhaustion. Nevertheless, she continued to push herself at Makarov's urging, 
even when the others took a brief break. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really improving," Makarov said through his translator. The Soviet 
artist was disappointed about the canceled performance in San Diego and the 
need to leave his own dancers behind for a month. (They will hook up in New 
York later in May to begin a tour of some major East Coast cities.) But Makarov 
is right at home with the San Diego dancers. "They are very perceptive," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old director danced principal roles at the prestigious Kirov for 30 
years before moving on to the Leningrad State Ballet to become Jakobson's 
"godchild." The Soviet choreographer created "Spartacus" for Makarov, and 
entrusted the company to him because (as Makarov's Soviet translator 
explained), "Makarov is not a choreographer, and (Jakobson) knew he wouldn't 
change anything." 
</P>
<P>
Poolos, one of three dancers learning the lead roles from the master, 
acknowledged that "it's been a lot of hard work working with Mr. Makarov. He 
works very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Evans echoed those sentiments, adding, "The work is very challenging. It's 
really great to learn 'Le Bayadere,' and the pas de trois from 'Swan Lake.' All 
we've ever done was the second act of 'Swan Lake.' " 
</P>
<P>
"If the performance hadn't been canceled," Dabrowski said, "we never would have 
gotten this chance to work with Mr. Makarov. He would have been spending time 
with his own company. It would have been great to learn from his dancers and to 
work together with them, but this has its advantages. This choreography is so 
different from what we've been doing." 
</P>
<P>
Makarov will leave his videotapes behind as a permanent record. But even more 
important to the company is the mental notes the company's ballet mistress and 
resident registeur takes while assisting the director from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Judy (Sharp) knows every movement," Mahon said. "She remembers what the 
choreographer wanted, and she'll help coach the dancers when Makarov is gone." 
</P>
<P>
"I danced 'Bayadere' with the San Diego Ballet years ago," Sharp recalled. 
"It's been so long, I didn't remember it, but it's been fun for me to rehearse 
with Mr. Makarov. And it's a great experience for the girls to learn it." 
</P>
<P>
The dancers will have an opportunity to demonstrate some of what they are 
learning Sunday when Makarov gives a choreography demonstration and master 
class at the studio. A reception with the artist will follow the 3:45 p.m. 
demonstration, which is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"As dancers, you always have to expect disappointments," Mahon said. "You never 
know when an injury will take you out of action. You've got to make something 
good come out of everything. And we'll be seeing the benefits of this residency 
for many years to come."

COMEDIAN HASN'T PLAYED SOUTHLAND IN EIGHT YEARS, UNLESS ONE COUNTS HER MANY 
AIRPORT APPEARANCES.

<P>
Stand-up comedian and cable TV fixture Elayne Boosler hasn't performed in 
Southern California for about eight years. No big deal? Well, we're talking 
about a woman who has lived in Los Angeles for the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I just go to the airport here," she said. "When I was starting I did about 12 
million shows here. Now I guess I perform in only 49 states." 
</P>
<P>
That's a fact that makes her May 14 show at the Arlington Theater in Santa 
Barbara all the more special. The performance will be the first stop on a 
50-concert summer tour she said will take her to places where she has never 
performed. "From Hawaii to the Catskills," she said. "And I'll probably see the 
same people in both places on vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Each performance on the tour figures to be unique because Boosler tailors her 
shows to the area in which she is appearing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get to a town I'll read the town paper. Then I'll go to the hotel and 
watch CNN. If I go to a mostly conservative city or a completely Republican 
city, like I did in Arizona, I go with mostly liberal stuff. I'm not saying I'm 
right, but it shakes them up . . . and I'll never see them again anyway." 
</P>
<P>
What does she have prepared for Santa Barbara? She's not sure yet, but knows 
one thing. "Obviously there's more of a West Coast sensibility so I won't talk 
about subways," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Boosler wait until she arrives in a town to prepare some of her 
material, much of the time she waits until she gets up on stage. "That's when 
I'm in the mood," she said. "I encourage talking back and forth. I can write a 
joke at home, but I really cook when I'm on stage. My best stuff is in response 
to someone." 
</P>
<P>
Mixed in with all the more spontaneous material, Boosler is sure to touch on a 
few of her standard topics. She might be most recognized for the routines she 
does about her life. 
</P>
<P>
"A show is kind of like going through the day," she said. "You go to the bank. 
You read the paper. You talk to a friend. You go on a date. The humor comes out 
of the fact that it is so tragic at times." 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there are the topics of the day . . . 
</P>
<P>
Like the state of the world: "Environment stuff is so big," she said. "It's a 
bandwagon everybody has jumped on. . . . Let's just hope it's unleaded. I'm 
cutting back. I'm recycling. On Earth Day I stayed home and put Styrofoam 
covering on my house. What scares me is that hot dogs last 50 years on the 
ground, but only a week in the fridge." 
</P>
<P>
For her Santa Barbara performance, Boosler will be fresh. But a 50-stop tour 
can be grueling. It's important that her hotel room accommodations are just 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"I like hotels where the 'Do not disturb' sign has meaning," she said. "A 'Do 
not disturb' sign to a housekeeper is like a red cape to a bull. You hang the 
sign out at two in the morning and wonder, 'Why do I bother? Why am I going 
through this charade?' It's because there is always hope in man. But sure 
enough, at 3 a.m. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And it isn't as though Boosler needs a housekeeper in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"I like a real filthy room with lots of noise, an unmade bed, food products in 
the drawer," she said. "I like a room next to the ice machine, where you can 
hear the ice dropping out one at a time and then you can hear the whole pile 
drop out. But the machine only starts after midnight, so it doesn't bother 
anybody during the day when they're not there. A room near a candy machine is 
good too. It's good to hear people in assorted languages scream for change." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the 8 p.m. show are $17.50. The Arlington is located at 1317 State 
St. Call 963-4408 for tickets.

UCLA'S JASON NETTER: HIS PLAY VARIES FROM GOOD, TO BAD, TO UGLY; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: TOP SINGLES PLAYER IS AT HIS BEST IN TOURNAMENTS, BUT HIS PERFORMANCE 
SLUMPS IN DUAL MEETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jason Netter, top singles player for the UCLA men's tennis team, can be either 
very good or very bad, but he was at his best at the biggest event of the 
season so far -- the Pacific 10 Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Netter won the Pac-10 singles championship, upsetting Jared 
Palmer of two-time defending NCAA champion Stanford in the semifinals and 
another Stanford standout, Alex O'Brien, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Netter also won the Rolex regional tournament singles title in November, 
defeating Arizona's Scott Sigerseth in straight sets in the final. In March, he 
defeated Donny Isaak of USC to capture the championship of the Southern 
California Intercollegiate tournament. Netter's record in tournaments is 18-2. 
</P>
<P>
But in dual meets, he is only 8-14. Before capturing the Pac-10 title, he had 
lost six of eight dual matches and had dropped to No. 50 in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
In his past two outings, he lost both his singles matches as the Bruins won at 
home against Pepperdine, 5-3, and defeated UC Irvine, 6-3, on the road. He was 
defeated by Pepperdine's ninth-ranked David Wells-Roth, 2-6, 6-0, 6-4, and lost 
to Irvine's 20th-ranked Trevor Kronemann, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett, whose Bruins have won seven NCAA championships and 12 
conference crowns in 24 years, isn't sure how to explain the dichotomy between 
Netter's play in tournaments and in dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett said that in tournaments, "maybe (Netter) gets into the swing of 
things. In dual matches you play (only) every three or four days. It may be a 
matter of getting into rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
Netter struggled in his first match in the Pac-10 tournament against 
California's Matt Stroyman before winning, 6-1, 2-6, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Netter's match against Pepperdine's Wells-Roth on Friday was in some ways a 
capsule of his season. He was hot in the first set, cold in the second set and 
competitive in the third set before losing. 
</P>
<P>
When Pepperdine defeated the Bruins, 5-4, in Malibu in February, Wells-Roth won 
in straight sets. Last week Wells-Roth seemed to be trying to overpower Netter 
in the opening set, attempting to hit winners with every stroke. But he made a 
lot of unforced errors, and Netter picked him apart with his accurate base-line 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, it was Netter's turn to make mistakes, and Wells-Roth won 
six consecutive games. Netter battled back in the third set before losing, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gallien, Pepperdine co-coach, said that Netter "did not play well at 
all" in the second set and that his "concentration sort of wandered" in the 
third set. 
</P>
<P>
"If David had continued to play poorly, it probably would have gone Jason's 
way," Gallien said. 
</P>
<P>
Netter thinks he hasn't played better in dual matches because he has been 
bothered for about two years by tendinitis in his right shoulder. But he said 
that the only thing affected by the tendinitis was his serve and that he hasn't 
felt pain in the shoulder for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he thinks the tendinitis has been cured by treatment and exercise 
and that the shoulder has given him "no worries at all. I can go out and serve 
as hard as I want, and I've had no problems so far." 
</P>
<P>
Netter said he thinks other reasons for his up-and-down year might have been 
that he didn't play with much confidence and was not in the best physical shape 
at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gallien said that Netter's game demands that he be in top physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't win a lot of points with overheads and volleys," Gallien said. 
"He's not an attacker, which means that he's been playing a lot of long points. 
Over the course of the season that's quite a physical grind." 
</P>
<P>
Netter said the losses in dual matches have served a useful purpose. "Losing 
got me into better shape and got me to focus on tennis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Netter will focus on the NCAA team and individual championships, which begin 
May 18 at Indian Wells. He is a long shot to win a national singles title. The 
tournament favorites will be Todd Martin of Northwestern, Jose-Luis Noriega of 
the University of San Diego and Jonathan Stark of Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Stark, the nation's top-ranked freshman, did not play in the Pac-10 tournament 
because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Gallien thinks that Wells-Roth and Alejo Mancisidor, a Pepperdine freshman from 
Spain who is ranked 21st, should also be in the running for the NCAA singles 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever wins the (NCAA) individual title will be someone who is in great 
shape, I'll tell you that," Gallien said, alluding to the desert heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen," Bassett said. "A million people have a shot (at the 
title). It will be interesting to see how people can handle the heat -- and it 
will be hot." 
</P>
<P>
Gallien believes that Netter is a threat to win the NCAA title because he won 
the Pac-10 championship. 
</P>
<P>
"You will have to be on your game for four straight days in oppressive heat," 
Gallien said, adding that a player in the individual portion of the tournament 
could also be physically drained if his school does well in team competition. 
</P>
<P>
But don't count out Netter. After all the national competition is a tournament, 
and tournaments seem to be his forte.

A HEARTFELT THANK YOU 50 YEARS IN THE MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For almost 50 years, Sam Dierinzo had wanted to say thank you. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge man got his chance Sunday at a seniors gathering at Century City 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The guest speaker at that event, an old-fashioned ice-cream social and 
information fair sponsored by the hospital and the Westside Consortium of 
Senior Services, was actor Lew Ayres, 81. 
</P>
<P>
Most people know Ayres as Hollywood's original Dr. Kildare and as the young 
German soldier who reaches for a butterfly just before he is killed in the 
final frames of the classic anti-war film, "All Quiet on the Western Front." 
</P>
<P>
But Dierinzo met Ayres in the flesh in 1944 in an Army hospital in the 
Philippines. Dierinzo, now 65, was a teen-age soldier, recovering from a back 
wound he received from a Japanese sniper on the island of Leyte ("I'm still 
scratching it for him," his wife, Marge, said). Ayres was a conscientious 
objector who had refused to fight but spent almost all of World War II serving 
as an Army medic. 
</P>
<P>
It would make a better story, Dierinzo acknowledged, if Ayres, who was under 
fire many times, had carried Dierinzo bleeding from the battlefield. Ayres 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't save my life or anything," Dierinzo, manager of fleet operations for 
Anheuser-Busch in Sylmar, said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Ayres had done the ordinary things medics do: bringing Dierinzo a 
bedpan, helping ease the discomfort of a cast that encased him from neck to 
knees, stopping in to talk from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
What distinguished Ayres, Dierinzo recalled, was his manner and his compassion. 
"He was so different in his mannerism and his politeness and his kindness," 
Dierinzo said. "In your hour of need like that, it just reminded you so much of 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Ayres, who still plays an occasional movie or TV role, didn't 
recognize the former soldier when Dierinzo introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Good morning, Mr. Ayres," he said. "I had the pleasure of meeting you many, 
many years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Dierinzo told Ayres that his wartime kindness "helped me out a lot. I always 
wanted to meet you and thank you." 
</P>
<P>
The men reminisced for a few moments. Ayres recalled how much the war had 
taught him about himself and his fellow man. "I'm grateful I had the 
experience," he said. "I don't regret one moment." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Ayres said that making "All Quiet on the Western Front" in 1929 may have 
started him on the controversial road to pacifism. At some point he realized 
that he couldn't kill, even for his country. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I couldn't live with myself," he said. "I could understand a society 
needing to protect itself, but I couldn't do it." He said he still believes 
that nonviolence is usually more effective than violence, but he realizes, in 
retrospect, that Nazism "had to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Dierinzo described meeting Ayres again as a "wonderful experience." 
</P>
<P>
After their brief reunion, Ayres spoke to the crowd of about 300 on such 
matters as his lifelong study of world religions and having his first and only 
child at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
He called his remarks "Reaching for the Butterfly."

CRITIC AT LARGE: CANDID CAMERA: BEHIND THE SCENES WITH DAVID BROWN; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE PRODUCER HAS JUST PUBLISHED A BOOK FILLED WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF HIS 
HOLLYWOOD CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There was a time when David Brown and a partner earned $600 for writing a 
month's supply of astrological forecasts suitable for use in a penny vending 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to be cautiously helpful," Brown said at breakfast earlier this 
week'Avoid unnecessary risks,' 'Drive with special care,' that sort of thing, 
or 'Your luck will soon change,' not indicating whether it would change for 
better or worse." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, now 73, has done a lot of things. Just out of Stanford and Columbia, he 
was a copy editor and second drama critic on the pre-chic Women's Wear Daily. 
"Our readers were the buyers and they wanted to know about the musicals and the 
hits. Kelcey Allen did those. I got the leftovers -- T.S. Eliot, Odets, all the 
really good stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, he wrote textbooks on journalism, was fiction editor and 
then editor-in-chief of Liberty magazine, story editor under Darryl Zanuck at 
Fox and then partnered in production with Richard Zanuck. Together, they did 
"Jaws," "The Sting," "The Verdict," "Cocoon" and other less conspicuous films. 
Not long before they came to what Brown calls an amicable parting, he acquired 
the film rights to "Driving Miss Daisy" for the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a highly contested negotiation," Brown says. "I think I got the rights 
only because my wife (Helen Gurley Brown) warned everyone that I might jump out 
the window if I didn't." Then the partners went separate ways and Dick and Lili 
Zanuck produced the Oscar-winning film. (As he has for 25 years, Brown writes 
the lively cover blurbs for his wife's Cosmopolitan magazine.) 
</P>
<P>
With his own company, the Manhattan Project (home base is New York), Brown has 
since been producing in several areas. The first three of a series of classic 
short stories he is making for HBO here and Granada in Britain have finished 
shooting and will start to air in August. "Perversely," Brown says, "I call the 
series 'Women and Men.' " 
</P>
<P>
The first, Hemingway's "Hills Like White Elephants," stars Melanie Griffith and 
James Woods and was directed by Tony Richardson and shot in Spain. Dorothy 
Parker's "Dust Before Fireworks" was directed by Ken Russell and stars Molly 
Ringwald and Peter Weller. Mary McCarthy's most famous story, "The Man in the 
Brooks Brothers Shirt," has been adapted and directed by Frederic Raphael 
("Glittering Prizes") and features Beau Bridges and Elizabeth McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has a play opening next week in London, a satire on New York dinner 
parties called "Vanilla," directed by Harold Pinter from a play by Jane Stanton 
Hitchcock. Running on Broadway are other Brown productions: "Tru," the one-man 
show about Truman Capote for which Robert Morse just earned a Tony nomination, 
and "A Few Good Men," one of whose stars, Tom Hulce, has also been nominated 
for a Tony. Coming along after successful out-of-town dates in Cleveland and 
Washington is "Cemetery Club," a comedy by Ivan Menschell about three women who 
meet once a month to visit their husband's graves. 
</P>
<P>
He has four films in what Brown calls active pre-production. With Joe Wizan, 
Brown is co-producing "Midnight Club," which will star Sylvester Stallone, and 
he is working on a screen version of "A Few Good Men." Two more thrillers are 
coming along: Michael Tolkin's "The Player," about an executive threatened by 
an actor whose calls he won't return, and Ruth Rendell's chilly "The 
Bridesmaid," about a couple both fatefully obsessed with death, which Brown 
hopes Ken Russell will direct. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is also marketing a couple of television talk shows, one that would 
feature David Frost in a kind of updated "Information Please," the other with 
astrologer Joyce Jillson. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown was principally in town in behalf of his book, "Let Me Entertain You" 
(Morrow: $19.95), a roughly chronological grab bag of anecdotes and 
recollections out of his multicolored career. 
</P>
<P>
The book, he says, has been in work longer than some of the people in it have 
been alive. It began at the urging of his pal, Gene Shalit, who said Brown 
should set down some of his stories. "Nineteen years ago I began carrying a 
tape recorder around and I'd talk to it on planes, everywhere, as stories came 
back to me." 
</P>
<P>
The tapes transcribed out at more than a million words. "It was sort of like a 
data bank. Two-and-a-half years ago, I started writing it out as a book. I had 
some role models: Alexander Kings's 'May This House Be Safe From Tigers,' Harry 
Golden's 'Only in America' and what I think is a classic, Alexander Woollcott's 
'While Rome Burns.' It's not an autobiography, just selective memories. Given 
the attention span of present audiences, I thought it might be a sensible 
form." 
</P>
<P>
It is a charming exercise in recollection, glimpses of everyone from J. Paul 
Getty to John Belushi. But Brown says, "I try not to be a Shintoist, worshiping 
ancestors." In particular, he does not really yearn for the Hollywood past, 
although he was part of it in the waning days Kafkaesque qualities, you have to 
believe somebody in the San Fernando Valley did a report."ELLEN JASKOL / Los

TRAVELS OF AN ACTIVIST; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: AN ARDENT SANDINISTA SUPPORTER, ALICE MCGRATH HAS MADE 34 TRIPS, 
ESCORTING DOCTORS, LAWYERS, CLERGYMEN AND EDUCATORS THROUGH A TROUBLED COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During the 1940s Alice McGrath was a passionate young advocate for the 
Mexican-Americans convicted in the racially fired Sleepy Lagoon murder case in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At 73, she is still battling social injustice. At an age when some women cruise 
the Caribbean, the Ventura woman chaperones groups to war-scarred Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
An ardent supporter of the Sandinistas, she has made 34 treks to Nicaragua 
since 1984, escorting doctors, lawyers, clergymen and educators throughout the 
troubled country. 
</P>
<P>
But a trip McGrath began earlier this month could prove the most crucial. In 
the wake of President Daniel Ortega's recent defeat, she is testing the 
political waters for future group excursions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea how I'm going to be received," said McGrath, a vigorous 
opponent of U.S. intervention, before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath is no neophyte when it comes to social activism. 
</P>
<P>
Her speeches raised money during World War II for defense attorneys to appeal 
the convictions and ultimately free the defendants in the Sleepy Lagoon murder 
case, called "zoot suiters" for their distinctive pegged pants and long coats. 
</P>
<P>
Only in her mid-20s then, she spent two years writing and visiting the 
defendants in San Quentin while the case went through the courts. She was the 
real-life Alice in the play and the movie, "Zoot Suit." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same struggle," she said, comparing the zoot suiters and the 
Sandinistas. "The struggle for social justice didn't start two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Chatting in her hillside home overlooking the ocean, McGrath doesn't seem like 
someone who has lived for nearly three-quarters of a century. She learned to 
swim when she was 65 and does laps every other day. She's petite, her gray hair 
stylishly cut. Her brown eyes dominate her finely chiseled face. And when she 
talks, it's a performance full of zest, passion and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I love being an old lady," she said. Pointing to the orange trees in her 
large, sloping yard, she told how she makes marmalade from the fruit. Then with 
a laugh, she adds, "But I don't have a lot of domestic skills." 
</P>
<P>
She raves about George Bernard Shaw's plays. "He had heroines with professions 
-- women who were independent." She extols the music of Bach and Mozart. 
"Anything past Stravinsky is unavailable to my ears." 
</P>
<P>
But issues clearly take precedence in her life. Her 70th birthday party turned 
into a benefit for a Nicaraguan hospital that netted about $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath grew up poor in Los Angeles, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants. 
There was no money for education past high school. She held unskilled jobs -- 
factory worker and sales clerk -- before she became involved in the zoot suit 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my college," she said. She sat through part of the trial because one of 
her friends was an attorney in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I was outraged," she said. "It was one of the most offensive trials held in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The trial took place at a time of intense racial hostility toward 
Mexican-Americans. Twenty-two young Mexican-Americans were charged in the death 
of another youth during a gang fight near a Montebello irrigation ditch known 
as Sleepy Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The 22 young people were tried en masse in what is now recognized as one of 
the worst travesties of justice," McGrath said. "The judge made no attempt to 
even seem to be impartial." 
</P>
<P>
The jury found 17 of the defendants guilty and acquitted five. 
</P>
<P>
During the appeal, McGrath, then Alice Greenfield, went to work as executive 
secretary of the defense committee. At first she simply ran the mimeograph 
machine. Then she was asked to speak to small groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid -- I was quite socially timid," she said. "By the end of the year 
I was going up to San Francisco talking to a longshoremen's meeting of a 
thousand guys. I'd swoop onto the stage, making my presentation with gestures." 
</P>
<P>
After the convictions were overturned, she became preoccupied with raising two 
children. She never lost interest in social issues, but none consumed her like 
the Sleepy Lagoon case. 
</P>
<P>
For a time she was married to a poet, Thomas McGrath, who lost his job as a 
teacher during the McCarthy era. In the late 1950s she married martial arts 
instructor and author Bruce Tegner, who died five years ago. They moved to 
Ventura in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath has written books on self-defense and for 25 years she taught it, 
developing simpler and more practical methods for women. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1984 her life took a different twist. She traveled to Nicaragua with a 
large group of Americans on the fifth anniversary of the Sandinista revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"What I saw in Nicaragua was so impressive," she said. She cited strides she 
said the country had made in health, education and working conditions before 
U.S. involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a country dedicated to helping the poor," she said. "I wanted to become 
involved in taking people down there. It was important for U.S. people to know 
what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
At first she escorted groups under the auspices of the Office of the Americas 
and then through Operation California USA. Now she's coordinating with a 
Nicaraguan research and academic institution and the Latin American Studies 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
She has her own theories about Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's upset victory over 
Ortega for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"It was giving the people a choice between sovereignty and bread," she said. 
"They finally said, 'We're starving, we're tired, we're exhausted.' " 
</P>
<P>
McGrath doesn't conceal her politics on these treks, yet her traveling 
companions range from conservative to liberal in their views. 
</P>
<P>
"My purpose is not to convert them to my point of view, but to let them see as 
much as possible and then come to their own conclusions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have accompanied her agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably the most conservative person she's ever taken along," said 
Ventura attorney Joseph R. Henderson. "It didn't appear to me that she was 
pro-Sandinista. She was just trying to introduce Americans to what is going on 
there." 
</P>
<P>
On his trip last June, Henderson visited hospitals, newspapers, relief 
agencies, farm cooperatives, and social service and economic experts -- many of 
them on opposing sides of the country's political issues. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Ramirez, director of the Channel Counties Legal Services Assn., has 
traveled to Nicaragua five times with McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
"She has such a young personality and attitude toward life," Ramirez said. "I 
have to run to catch up to her in airports, and I'm considerably younger." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath didn't take her groups near any fighting, but they saw signs of it as 
well as graphic proof of the county's Third-World status. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw horrible things," Ramirez said, recalling a hospital visit. "We saw a 
child with half his face shot off." Bedding was sterilized in boiling vats 
heated by fires outside, she said. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath never tires of the trips. Sometimes she is asked why she picked 
Nicaragua when there are so many other social causes closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm paying for the millions that went to destroy that country," she said. "I 
feel responsible for doing something about the damage there. Each of us chooses 
to work in an area that touches something in us."

TOMAS O FIAICH; CARDINAL OF ALL IRELAND, CRITIC OF BRITISH RULE

<TEXT>
<P>
Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, the primate of all Ireland and an outspoken critic of 
the British government, has died during a pilgrimage to the French shrine of 
Lourdes. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
O Fiaich, appointed head of both the church in the Republic of Ireland and 
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland in 1977, was taken 95 miles to Toulouse 
by helicopter Tuesday after suffering an apparent heart attack, a hospital 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement of the death, issued by the church's press office in Ireland, 
said O Fiaich had appeared ill to doctors accompanying the group of 600 
pilgrims from his seat at Armagh in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes is a Catholic shrine where in 1858 a peasant girl reported a vision of 
the Virgin Mary. Miraculous cures have been reported there. 
</P>
<P>
While calling for a unified Ireland and criticizing British policy in Northern 
Ireland, O Fiaich, (pronounced O'Fee), also castigated the violence of the 
Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
The predominantly Catholic outlawed guerrilla army seeks to end British rule in 
Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't unite people with bombs and bullets," the cardinal once said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after he was appointed spiritual leader of Ireland's 4 million 
Catholics, Pope John Paul II made O Fiaich one of the first cardinals of his 
papacy. 
</P>
<P>
O Fiaich was born Thomas Fee in Cullyhanna, in south Armagh, within sight of 
the border with the Irish Republic. He changed his name to the Gaelic form as 
his love of the Irish language and nationalist sentiments developed. 
</P>
<P>
He was ordained in 1948. During a 25-year academic career, he taught modern 
history at St. Patrick's College in Maynooth, west of Dublin, and served as its 
president from 1974 to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
O Fiaich supported political and church appeals on behalf of Irish prisoners in 
British jails and called for a review of the case of six Irishmen convicted of 
killing 21 people in 1974 in IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
He also blasted Britain in 1988 over its decision not to prosecute a soldier 
who shot dead an unarmed man at an observation post on the Irish border. 
</P>
<P>
But O Fiaich was also quick to condemn IRA violence, making an emotional plea 
to Protestants for forgiveness after an IRA bomb killed 11 people attending a 
war memorial service in the town of Enniskillen in 1987.
