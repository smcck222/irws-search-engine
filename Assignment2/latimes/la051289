A judge in Oakland sentenced a man to 54 years to life for his part in an 
assault rifle attack on a security guard hired to drive drug dealers from the 
city's crime-ridden Acorn Housing Project. Shawn Garth, 23, of Oakland, was 
convicted of two attacks in October, 1988, that killed one security guard, 
wounded two others and wounded an 18-month-old girl in the leg. Garth is 
believed to be one of four men who sprayed the housing project's security shack 
with gunfire after the guards broke up an illegal dice ring. Two weeks later, 
Garth sprayed another Oakland house with gunshots, wounding the baby. "These 
crimes were vicious and were committed without regard to human life, including 
the life of an 18-month-old child," said Alameda County Superior Court Judge 
Sandra Margulies.

Dissident groups in South Korea charged that a radical student was tortured and 
killed by police interrogators, and they called for peaceful protests to demand 
the fall of President Roh Tae Woo's government. About 5,000 students rallied at 
Chosun University in the southeastern city of Kwangju to denounce police for 
the death of Chol Kuy Lee, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. 
Lee, 24, a student at Chosun, had served almost two years in jail for violating 
national security laws and was being sought by police for writing articles 
praising Communist North Korea. His body was found in a reservoir near Kwangju, 
police said. A government spokesman said Roh has ordered an investigation into 
Lee's death.

The Senate named a 12-member committee to hear evidence in the impeachment 
trial of U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, who is serving a 
five-year prison term for perjury. Senators acted after Rep. Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.) came to the Senate floor to formally notify them of Nixon's 
impeachment by the House on grounds he lied to a grand jury and federal 
prosecutors. Brooks, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, reviewed the 
three articles of impeachment against Nixon, approved 417 to 0, and told 
senators the House "demands his conviction and appropriate judgment thereon." 
Senators then acted to summon Nixon, who is incarcerated at Eglin Air Force 
Base in Florida.

Philippine police have arrested a Communist rebel officer in connection with 
the murder of U.S. Army Col. James N. Rowe last month, the U.S. military said. 
It said Ricardo Prestosa was picked up at his home in Bataan province, 30 miles 
east of Manila but that he denied any role in the killing. Authorities said 
that Prestosa, 29, alleged chief of the Communist New People's Army's political 
section in Bataan, was identified by police through a sketch of the attackers 
made from witnesses' descriptions. Rowe, 51, a Vietnam War hero, was killed 
when he was ambushed and shot by gunmen on his way to work April 21. The 
Communists claimed responsibility, accusing Rowe of aiding an anti-insurgency 
campaign.

A no-smoking policy will be imposed at all jails in Fresno County, effective 
June 10, Sheriff Steve Magarian announced. At the same time, instruction and 
counseling will be offered to help inmates quit smoking, he said. The sheriff 
said smoking will be banned because it is unhealthy and to reduce the chances 
of fires. "We really do hope that we get some letters down the road from some 
inmates that say, 'You know, you really got me on the road to get off 
cigarettes,' " Magarian said.

The Pentagon plans extensive tests this summer on a "Star Wars" concept known 
as "Brilliant Pebbles" and may incorporate the theory in its plans as early as 
next fall, a Pentagon official said. Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., director 
of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, said two groups will study 
the space-based defense concept, in which thousands of satellites designed to 
knock down enemy missiles orbit the earth. Monahan identified the two groups as 
the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon committee, and the Jasons, a group of 
university professors, mostly physicists, retained by the department to conduct 
independent analysis.

UC Riverside administrators have discriminated, harassed and retaliated against 
staff members on the basis of sex, race, age, national origin and disability 
for more than 20 years, 24 employees contended in a class-action discrimination 
complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. The case falls under federal 
jurisdiction because the campus holds contracts with the U.S. government. Labor 
Department investigators have been on campus to interview staff members who 
signed the complaint, officials said, and Labor Department investigators met 
last week with Chancellor Rosemary S.J. Schraer, said university spokesman Jack 
R. Chappell. But he said the campus has not been formally notified of any 
investigation. Wanda Clark, a staff member speaking for the employees who 
signed the complaint, said events supporting the claim go back as far as 1968.

Illinois Atty. Gen. Neil Hartigan filed a federal lawsuit to halt the closure 
of 86 military installations throughout the country, calling the process by 
which the closings were ordered "absurd." Hartigan's complaint contends the 
government's Base Closure Act is unconstitutional and seeks to enjoin Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney from implementing any of the recommendations of the 
Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. The House last month voted not to 
block the recommended closures, which were announced late last year.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHURCH WINS OK TO REBUILD HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has voted to allow the Neighborhood 
Church to build a social hall on its bluff-top property at Malaga Cove. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on Tuesday brought to a close eight years of controversy between the 
church, a popular site for weddings and other social activities, and its 
neighbors, who said the addition would increase traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
After numerous public hearings before the Planning Commission and the City 
Council, the church and the neighbors, who banded together as the Malaga Cove 
Homeowners Assn., agreed to 21 conditions under which the permit was granted. 
Among other things, the conditions limit the church to two weddings on 
Saturdays and ban Sunday weddings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRM FINED $1,000 IN DRIVER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matson Terminals Inc. has been fined $1,000 for violating federal job safety 
laws after a truck driver was crushed to death last month by a shipping 
container at its Terminal Island facility. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie W. Michael, director of the federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration office in Long Beach, said Matson was cited for the failure of a 
crane operator to properly engage so-called "J" hooks used to lift containers. 
</P>
<P>
Michael said the failure allowed the 40-foot shipping container to drop onto 
the truck cab, killing Michael Gomez, 27, of Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan White, senior counsel for Matson Navigation Co., parent company of Matson 
Terminals, said no decision has been made on whether to contest OSHA's citation 
and fine. "We are still in the process of investigating exactly what the cause 
of the accident was," White said.

PLANNING COMMISSION OKS WARNER RIDGE OFFICE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delivering a stunning blow to Woodland Hills homeowners -- and a slap at City 
Councilwoman Joy Picus -- Los Angeles planning commissioners Thursday approved 
construction of a controversial $150-million high-rise project next to a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members voted 3 to 2 to allow development of the nine-building 
Warner Ridge office complex at the northeast corner of De Soto Avenue and 
Oxnard Street. They rejected pleas by Picus and nearby residents that 
single-family houses be built on the ridge instead. 
</P>
<P>
Planners praised the 22 1/2-acre proposal as "a quality development" that has 
built-in safeguards to keep it from causing traffic jams in the adjoining 
Warner Center area in the western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents, who have spent 30 months fighting the development, warned that 
it will bring gridlock to nearby streets. They complained that the high-rises 
will extend Warner Center's urbanization for the first time beyond its 
boundaries and into a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry, outraged, appalled by what they did," Picus said after the 
commission vote. "This is a very pro-development commission appointed by the 
mayor. It reflects his pro-development bias." 
</P>
<P>
Picus vowed to try to overturn the commission action at the City Council -- 
although she acknowledged that it may be difficult to win the eight council 
votes necessary to do that. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the council heeds the wishes of the council member in whose district 
a development is proposed. But Warner Ridge developer Jack Spound has been 
lobbying the council members, Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a chore. I will really have to work at it. It won't be 
easy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Councilman Hal Bernson, head of the council's influential Planning and 
Environment Committee, has already "dropped hints" that he supports the Warner 
Ridge proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just horrified at the commission allowing an intrusion of Warner Center 
into a single-family neighborhood," she said. "This was a quality-of-life issue 
that was ignored by the majority of the commission." 
</P>
<P>
Dejected leaders of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization said they will 
continue their opposition when the project's zone change and general plan 
amendment come before the council for review. But they wavered on an earlier 
pledge to fight the project in court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We need eight votes, and we know we have one for sure," Robert Gross, a vice 
president of the group, said in reference to Picus' planned council fight. 
</P>
<P>
But Gross would not speculate about whether his organization would file a 
lawsuit to block the high-rises. Last week, the group lost a suit that it had 
filed to prevent development of surplus Pierce College land. This week, the 
homeowners were asked to pay $58,000 in attorney's fees that the developer 
spent in fighting their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Spound said he is confident that changes made during the past two years in his 
construction plans will protect the adjacent neighborhood of 30-year-old homes. 
</P>
<P>
He said the changes were made at the request of nearby residents, some of whom 
withdrew their opposition and became supporters of the project during the 2 1/2 
years of debate. "We hope the City Council complies with its commission's 
recommendation," said Spound, who is in partnership with the Johnson Wax 
Development Corp. on the project. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the Warner Ridge commercial complex would consist of three 
seven-story buildings, two five-story structures, one four-story building, one 
three-story building, a one-story restaurant and a parking structure that would 
be partially built into the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings would be positioned so that the ridge would screen them from the 
view of residents of the nearby Carlton Terrace residential neighborhood. Dirt 
excavated from the site would be piled into a berm along the northeastern edge 
of the site to similarly shield next-door Pierce College from the offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Welcomed 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's commission approval was welcomed by college officials. Although they 
were told last month by the Los Angeles Community College District to stay 
neutral in the dispute, school officials made it clear that they oppose 
construction of homes on Warner Ridge because of the potential for homeowner 
complaints about flies and odors from the campus farm. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Suzette Neiman and William R. Christopher voted against the 
high-rises. Neiman said she believes that the project would destroy the 
integrity of the city's effort to cluster tall buildings in the middle of 
Warner Center. Christopher indicated that he thought that the project was too 
big. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioners Theodore Stein Jr. and Fernando Torres-Gil and panel 
President William G. Luddy praised the Warner Ridge plan. They rejected a 
suggestion by city planning staff members that the project's proposed 810,000 
square feet of floor space be reduced to 541,700 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is a quality development," Stein said. "If all projects on 
Ventura Boulevard had its quality, the dissension we see there week by week 
wouldn't be there."

BURBANK BAR EMPLOYEES, 6 OFF-DUTY POLICEMEN BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities said Thursday that they are investigating a bar brawl that erupted 
between six off-duty Los Angeles police officers, five employees and a customer 
at a Burbank restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Four Burbank police cars responded to a major disturbance call shortly before 
midnight Wednesday in the bar at the Black Angus restaurant at 235 S. 1st St., 
Police Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers found that six off-duty Los Angeles officers had scuffled with a 
bartender, two cocktail waitresses, two bouncers and at least one customer 
after one of the officers accused the customer of knocking over a bottle of 
beer, authorities and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Several people involved in the brawl, including at least one officer, suffered 
minor injuries. No arrests were made, although the incident is being 
investigated by Burbank police and has been referred to the Los Angeles Police 
Department for an internal investigation, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Because no arrests were made, Burbank police declined to name the officers, who 
are assigned to the Wilshire Division, and the other people involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a major disturbance," Goldberg said. "Apparently everybody had been 
drinking. We have several versions of what happened. In essence it became a 
brawl." 
</P>
<P>
Black Angus bartender Ronnie Ortiz said the officers were sitting at the bar 
drinking beer about 11:15 p.m. when they became involved in a shouting match 
with a customer whom one of the officers accused of knocking a bottle of beer 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very loud and obnoxious," said Ortiz, who added that he did not know 
they were police officers until after the fight broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said two waitresses moved between the officers and the man with whom they 
were arguing. He said the officers pushed them out of the way, knocking one to 
the ground and the other against the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw me onto the floor," said Norene Youngblood, one of the waitresses. 
"Then one twisted my arm up behind my back. It turned into quite a ruckus. 
Customers were scattering all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Put Into Chokehold 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said he jumped over the bar to try to protect the waitresses but was 
grabbed by the officers and put into a chokehold. Ortiz and Youngblood said two 
bar bouncers joined the fracas, which finally ended when the officers dragged 
the man accused of spilling the beer out a side door and handcuffed him face 
down in the parking lot. Ortiz said he saw the officers striking the man while 
he was on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
After Burbank police arrived, the handcuffed man was treated by paramedics and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"Our officers determined there was insufficient evidence to hold him, coupled 
with the fact that he needed medical attention," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, said the incident 
is being investigated by the department's internal affairs unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We will make a determination about propriety or impropriety of our officers' 
actions," he said.

Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks was closed in both directions for almost four 
hours Thursday when a truck carrying concrete slabs became wedged beneath the 
San Diego Freeway overpass, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic Officer Dennis Smith said the accident occurred about 5:30 a.m. when 
the tractor-trailer drove under the overpass near Sepulveda Boulevard and the 
Sherman Oaks Galleria and two precast concrete walls became jammed against the 
overpass. The truck was heading west to a construction site, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the slabs crumbled upon impact and chunks of concrete fell onto 
eastbound lanes of Ventura Boulevard, he said. No one was injured and there 
apparently was no damage to the overpass, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Truck driver Larry Borrink reportedly had measured the height of his four-ton 
cargo before going under the overpass and erroneously thought that there was 
clearance, Smith said. After the cargo became wedged, Borrink could not remove 
the truck by bleeding air from its tires because authorities feared that the 
maneuver might shift the load and cause it to spill. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the debris in the street and the danger that the slabs might fall 
off the truck, police closed all six traffic lanes while a heavy-equipment tow 
truck pulled the slabs off the truck. The roadway was reopened about 9:15 a.m., 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident caused traffic to back up in both directions on Ventura Boulevard, 
police said. Detoured traffic also caused snarls on Sepulveda Boulevard and 
other nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Borrink was cited for carrying too tall a load on his truck and for 
not having a city permit allowing him to transport an oversized load on city 
streets.

JURORS HEAR TAPE OF POLICE INTERROGATION; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDANT SOBS BUT REMAINS IN CONTROL UNDER INTENSE QUESTIONING IN DEATH OF 
ACTRESS MOTHER 
</P>

<P>
Detectives shouted "You killed her!" and "You had it all planned!" at Timothy 
Scott Roman shortly after the 25-year-old was picked up for questioning in the 
brutal slaying of his actress mother, according to a tape recording played in 
Van Nuys Superior Court on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But in contrast to the depiction of Roman as mentally fragile, the recording of 
the 90-minute interrogation indicates that the defendant held his own against 
the two interrogators. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, a former art student at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, is accused of 
beating to death his mother, 59-year-old Susan Cabot, in December, 1986, at the 
Encino home they shared. Cabot was a leading actress in 1950s action movies. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with first-degree murder but without the special conditions that could 
lead to the death penalty, Roman faces a possible term of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insanity Plea 
</P>
<P>
He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted of the slaying, 
his insanity claim will then be heard before the same jury. 
</P>
<P>
In pretrial motions and since the trial began three weeks ago, Roman, who 
suffers from a growth hormone deficiency and has been described by his attorney 
as "an experiment of the human race," has sat with head bowed and eyes 
downcast, seemingly oblivious to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
But in the taped interrogation, which took place between 1 and 3 the morning 
after the slaying, the defendant sobbed repeatedly but never seemed close to 
losing his composure. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing to do with it. I swear to God!" he shouted back at his 
interrogators. "I loved her." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he declared: "I'd like to speak to an attorney if we're going to have 
any more of this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Demand 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was defense attorney Chester Leo Smith who demanded that the 
tape be played for jurors, although his client's demeanor on tape seemed to 
undercut the defense claim that Roman's mental capacity is diminished by 
lifelong administration of a growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Smith would say only that he wanted to show jurors that "they 
leaned on him pretty hard." 
</P>
<P>
Before the playing of the tape, Los Angeles Police Detective Patrick Conmay 
testified that he decided to charge Roman with murder after Roman gave 
detectives "three separate and distinct versions" of what happened the night of 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
In the taped conversation, Roman told Conmay and Detective Philip Quartararo 
that when he went to investigate a pounding sound coming from his mother's 
bedroom, he was attacked by a tall Latino man wearing a Ninja mask. 
</P>
<P>
Stabbed in the arm and knocked unconscious, he called police, then waited for 
help to arrive before entering his mother's room, Roman said. 
</P>
<P>
Under further questioning, the defendant said that after calling police, he 
looked briefly into his mother's room from the entryway and saw her body lying 
across her bed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with Conmay and Quartararo prodding him repeatedly, Roman said that 
before calling police, he entered the bedroom, knelt down and lifted a 
blood-soaked cloth covering his mother's head and concluded that she was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Smith sought to get Conmay to admit that Roman could have believed all three 
versions were true at the time he related them. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Darlene S. Schempp upheld Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone's 
objection that such speculation was beyond the detective's expertise. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to continue for at least another month.

COMMISSION DELAYS CONSIDERATION OF PORTER RANCH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Planning Commission postponed consideration Thursday of a 
$2-billion development proposal for the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was rescheduled for May 25 to allow the city attorney's office time 
to review whether commissioners Theodore Stein Jr. and Suzette Neiman have 
conflicts of interest. Both have investments in a small housing tract about a 
mile from the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the tract's 19 homes have been sold and the remainder are expected 
to be sold in the next three to six months, Stein said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development Co. wants to build 2,195 single-family houses, 800 
units of multifamily housing and 7.5 million square feet of commercial space in 
the hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway over a 20- to 30-year period. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, a group opposed to the size of the commercial 
portion of the project canceled a press conference at which Los Angeles school 
board member Julie Korenstein was to appear. 
</P>
<P>
The event was canceled because the Planning Commission postponed its 
consideration of the Porter Ranch proposal, said Jack McGrath, who helped 
organize the press conference for the opposition group PRIDE. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development demanded an apology Wednesday for what it said were 
deliberate misstatements that Korenstein made about the firm. Korenstein 
refused, saying she didn't make the comments. A Korenstein spokesman said 
Thursday that the school board member's stand against the Porter Ranch proposal 
has not changed.

SUSPECT WANTED IN 17 BANK ROBBERIES IS ARRESTED IN SYLMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man listed among the 12 most wanted bank robbers in Los Angeles was arrested 
Thursday in his Sylmar apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Archie Michael Wolf, 35, was arrested on suspicion of robbery after police 
received a call from someone who had seen a photo of the man on a television 
news report Wednesday, Los Angeles police Detective Joe Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said Wolf is suspected in 17 bank robberies in Los Angeles and 10 
others outside the city. Authorities nicknamed the robber the "Red Eye" bandit 
because of a spot between his left eye and nose.

SMITH THE CATALYST AS BRAVES WIN SEVENTH IN ROW

<P>
Maybe it was only fitting that on a night when the Flyers' Stanley Cup bid was 
extinguished by the Montreal Canadiens, the Philadelphia Phillies would be 
tormented by Lonnie "Skates" Smith and Tom Glavine, a former second-round draft 
pick of the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who earned the nickname "Skates" for the way he spun his wheels 
offensively and defensively for the world champion Phillies in 1980, was guilty 
of high-sticking and slashing as he singled, doubled, homered, stole two bases 
and scored three runs in Atlanta's 8-3 romp at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine, a high-scoring high school center in the Boston area who has competed 
against several current NHL stars, improved to 5-0 with his second victory over 
the Phillies in a week. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has stamped himself as a comeback player of the year candidate with a 
blistering start that has earned him a spot high in 10 of the National League's 
12 major offensive categories. He was the driving force behind Atlanta's 
seventh consecutive victory, its longest winning streak since May 15-22, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had drug problems in the past, one reason the Phils traded him to 
Cleveland for Bo Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried when that happened," Smith said. "I love Philadelphia. I was hurt when 
they traded me, that's one reason I reacted so badly when it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Smith tried to convince managements in Philadelphia and St. Louis to sponsor 
his comeback before landing in Atlanta. He is now batting .342, leads the 
league with 28 runs scores and has a .587 on-base percentage. He's second in 
the league in stolen bases with 13 and in hits with 41. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have the desire to play right now and I'm happy," explained Smith of 
his best start, better even than when he was the MVP runner-up in 1982. "I 
don't know how long it will last." 
</P>
<P>
Glavine's start is the best by a Brave pitcher since Pascual Perez went 5-0 in 
1983.

NORTHRIDGE FUND DRIVE TOPS $100,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Cal State Northridge's six-week athletics fund-raising drive ended Thursday 
with its mission accomplished -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
When pledges and checks were added, the sum was $100,910 -- a little more than 
the $100,000 goal -- but significantly more than had previously been raised by 
the school for athletics. 
</P>
<P>
And that figure could grow. Several four- to five-digit pledges are still to be 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
"When we hit close to 60 (thousand) last year I was drained," said Ran Railey, 
CSUN's director of athletic development. "But this year I know there's more out 
there. It's just a matter of going out and collecting and talking to a few more 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Ballooning along with the school's athletic scholarship fund was the enrollment 
in CSUN's Athletic Assn. Membership swelled from 310 to more than 500 during 
the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Donations were taken for the general athletic fund but they could be earmarked 
for specific sports. Railey said that football, soccer and track appeared to be 
the big winners. 
</P>
<P>
Almost $28,000 was raised by phone solicitation of parents of athletes, alumni 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone-a-thon was a gold mine for us," Railey said. "This is the first year 
we've done anything serious like that. I guess it proved we should do even 
more."

THOUSAND OAKS' DROSHE SOUTHERN SECTION FINALIST IN 3 SWIMMING EVENTS 
</P>

<P>
Lauren Droshe of Thousand Oaks High posted the fastest qualifying time in the 
100-yard backstroke and anchored the Lancer girls' 200-yard medley relay team 
to the day's fastest time in that event Thursday at the Southern Section 4-A 
Division swimming preliminaries at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Droshe, a sophomore, was clocked in a school-record 59.0 seconds in the 
100-yard backstroke. Ann Peters set the previous record of 59.99 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In the relay, the Lancers trailed Dos Pueblos until Droshe's freestyle leg. 
Thousand Oaks' time of 1:50.86 is nearly two seconds better than that of the 
next-fastest qualifier, El Toro (1:52.04). 
</P>
<P>
Droshe also had the third-best qualifying time in the 50-yard freestyle 
(24.30). 
</P>
<P>
Shauna MacEwen of Westlake also had a good day, posting the third-best time in 
the 500-yard freestyle (4:54.62) and the fourth-best time in the 200-yard 
freestyle (1:52.20). Both times were personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Barbie of Camarillo was the other Valley-area competitor to qualify in 
two events for tonight's finals. Barbie placed second in the 100-yard freestyle 
(52.68) and sixth in the 200-yard individual medley (2:09.20). 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Ruth of Thousand Oaks, third in the 100-yard breaststroke (1:07.51), 
and Kelly Kocur of Royal, fourth in the 100-yard butterfly (59.27), also 
advanced to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A Division, Evy Wild of Hart led all qualifiers in the 100-yard 
freestyle (53.55). Mary Ellen Jenkins of Crescenta Valley and Burbank's Denise 
Lamoureaux (girls') and Casey Grigg (boys') each qualified in two events.

CITY BASEBALL COACHES TO BOYCOTT GAMES IN EVENT OF STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of City Section baseball coaches said Thursday that they would honor 
picket lines and boycott the conclusion of the regular season next week if 
teachers carry out a proposed strike against the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The group of 11 coaches also joined United Teachers-Los Angeles in criticizing 
the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn., which has recommended that coaches in all 
spring sports continue to supervise their teams even if they participate in the 
strike set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The position of the coaches' association was unanimously approved by 19 
representatives from the 49 City high schools at an emergency meeting Wednesday 
at Belmont High. The recommendation conforms to a directive issued this week by 
the district, which has reversed its field since the last strike 19 years ago 
when coaches who participated in the walkout were forced to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches' association gave its recommendation at the same time the baseball 
coaches struck their position. After a seeding meeting for the City 4-A 
Division playoffs, the coaches agreed to honor picket lines. They also said 
that they will meet Monday to discuss plans for the playoffs if a strike is not 
averted. Baseball playoffs begin May 24. The district plans no change in its 
athletics schedule and has devised no contingency plan in the event of a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
The union endorsed the baseball coaches and urged the association to change its 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proud of the baseball coaches who took the right stand and are 
disappointed in the other coaches," union representative Helen Bernstein said. 
"I hope they change their minds. I just don't think they understood the impact 
this would have on their colleagues. We're urging the same thing for all 
activities, including band and drama. It's not fair to make exceptions for one 
group." 
</P>
<P>
Association President Paul Knox, the Dorsey High football and track coach, 
lists himself as a strong union supporter. Like most coaches, he has examined 
his loyalties this week, weighing his ties to his colleagues against those to 
his players. He said that he will strike Monday but will cross picket lines to 
coach his athletes in next week's City track semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to come up with something that everyone could live with," he 
said. "This is only a recommendation, not a mandate. We're trying now to get 
this information out to every school so that this position can be explained. We 
don't want people to think we're deliberately doing something detrimental to 
the strike." 
</P>
<P>
Some already have reached that conclusion. Chatsworth baseball Coach Bob 
Lofrano, the vice president of the coaches association, attended the seeding 
meeting instead of the association's emergency meeting. He questioned the right 
of the association to make recommendations without consulting more coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"How could they make that decision without having a vote of the rank and file?" 
he said. "This is an individual thing, but we don't want coaches to sit on both 
sides of the fence. You have to strike as a teacher and a coach. I don't know 
how you can differentiate between the two." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball coaches have criticized the district's stance, saying that the 
directive was designed to shift parental complaints if sports events are 
canceled from the board to the coaches and to undermine union solidarity. Board 
and district officials have rejected those charges, saying that the move was 
made with the interests of students in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth volleyball Coach Steve Berk said that he would urge the other three 
coaches whose teams remain alive in the 4-A Division playoffs to honor picket 
lines next week at the expense of the semifinal and final rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to play and the kids haven't come all this way for nothing. But I 
hope the other coaches agree not to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although all coaches believe that the dilemma they face if a strike is called 
is severe, those most troubled may be golf and track coaches. A City 
championship marks the end of play for other sports, but track and golf finals 
also serve as qualifiers for state meets. Taft golf Coach Ray O'Connor and 
Birmingham track Coach Scott King said that they will accompany their athletes 
next week despite their loyalties to their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"For me to walk on my athletes would hurt me for years to come," King said. 
"There's no way I could do that. If I have one athlete left, I'll stay with 
him. I will come to school because I expect them to come to school. You can't 
just walk in in the afternoon and still coach." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some coaches expressed faith in the players' ability to understand 
should the coaches boycott events. "The issues here are greater than any one 
game," Poly baseball Coach Jerry Cord said. "I know we'll have to face some 
seniors who aren't going to be around after this year, but I truly feel the 
players will understand." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches may get the chance to test that understanding Monday.

VALLEY'S SEASON ENDS AS RALLY FALLS JUST SHORT; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COAST DROPS MONARCHS FROM STATE REGIONAL FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Just as it had done all season, the Valley College baseball team came from 
behind in Thursday's game against Orange Coast in the first round of the 
Southern California regional of the junior college state baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, Valley's last-ditch effort fell short. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, runners on second and third and three runs already across in the 
bottom of the ninth inning, Orange Coast reliever Eddie Pierce induced Mike 
Caputi to ground out to third, securing the Pirates' 8-6 victory at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Valley finished its season 29-12-1. Orange Coast (31-10-1) will meet Rancho 
Santiago, a 15-3 winner Thursday over East Los Angeles, in a second-round game 
Saturday at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of what we've done and the way we battled back after kind of 
struggling in the middle of the season," Valley Coach Chris Johnson said. "We 
knew Orange Coast was a good team, and, unfortunately for us, they proved it 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Thibault, a sophomore left-hander headed to Pepperdine, improved to 10-1 
by pitching 6 2/3 innings before giving way to Pierce, who earned his fifth 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Valley starter Joey Kane also was impressive in his six innings. However, the 
sophomore left-hander was hurt by Mike Kelly's two-run double in the second 
inning that tied the score, 2-2, and Randy Cordova's two-run homer in the fifth 
that gave the Pirates a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we scored, it seemed like they answered," said Caputi, a sophomore 
outfielder whose solo home run in the sixth pulled the Monarchs to within 4-3. 
"That's the sign of a good ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Orange Coast loaded the bases when Kane surrendered a single to 
Scott Talanoa, walked Cordova, then gave up a bunt single to Pierce, who 
started the game in right field. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Roberts replaced Kane and induced Darrell Conner to hit a ground ball to 
shortstop Ray Sabado for what appeared to be the start of a certain double 
play. Sabado, however, committed one of his three errors, bobbling the ball and 
throwing late to second, which allowed a run to score. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Kelly hit a sacrifice fly to right that scored Cordova from 
third to make the score 6-3.

CSUN'S MARTINEZ STYMIES DOMINGUEZ HILLS, 9-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a safe bet that, after 22 years, Fili Martinez and his valuable left arm 
have become friends. But every so often, his pitching arm throws him a curve. 
</P>
<P>
Examine Martinez's performance before and during a California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. baseball game at Cal State Dominguez Hills on Thursday: The Cal 
State Northridge senior allowed just two hits and struck out 14 en route to a 
9-0 shutout in the first game of a crucial three-game series between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
But before the game, Martinez felt as if weights were strapped to his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"It took forever for my fastball to get to the catcher in the bullpen," he 
said. "My curve was hanging and nothing felt right." 
</P>
<P>
Rest assured that when he took the field, everything looked right. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the Dominguez Hills batters, who couldn't touch Martinez's pitches until 
Adrian Rodriguez ripped a single up the middle in the sixth inning to spoil the 
no-hitter. Rob Campbell's ninth-inning double was the only other hit the Toros 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
Ask CSUN Coach Bill Kernen, who said of Martinez's outing: "It was one of those 
dominating performances where they don't even sniff. He's one of the 
top-quality left-handed pitchers in college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some -- I know." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez (8-3), who attributed the effectiveness of his breaking pitches to the 
steady breeze that blew across the diamond, had never faced Dominguez Hills 
(15-28-2, 10-17-1 in conference play) before. 
</P>
<P>
But by beating them Thursday, he kept Northridge's bid for a conference 
championship -- and a playoff berth -- alive. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (29-18-1, 15-11-1) scored two runs in the second and erupted for six 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the fourth, Greg Shockey hit a full-count pitch for a triple to 
the right-field wall, scoring Randy Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Chae-Ho Chong followed with a walk and Rusty McLain singled in the infield to 
score Shockey. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Vigo was hit by a pitch to load the bases, setting the stage for Mike 
Solar's grand slam over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge scored its final run in the fifth when Thompson, who singled up the 
middle, came home on a single to left by Shockey.

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: LOYOLA, PEPPERDINE DOMINATE ALL-STAR BASEBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Drooz 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine, Loyola Marymount and Santa Clara, who dominated the West Coast 
Athletic Conference baseball season and earned national rankings, also 
dominated the all-conference team announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
Conference champ Pepperdine placed five players on the first team -- second 
baseman Matt Howard, outfielders Rick Hirtensteiner and Richard Barnwell and 
pitchers Britt Craven and Wayne Helm -- and two more on the second team, 
shortstop Chris Martin and outfielder Jalal Leach. Loyola placed three on each 
team -- catcher Miah Bradbury, first baseman Greg Wall and pitcher Kalani Bush 
on the first team, third baseman Rick Allen, outfielder Travis Tarchione and 
pitcher Mike McNary on the second. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara also had three on the first team -- second baseman Ed Giovanola, 
shortstop Matt Toole and pitcher Greg Gohr -- and four on the second team -- 
catcher Troy Buckley, outfielder Bruce Powers, designated hitter Bill Enos and 
pitcher Larry Donahe. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine dominated the top four awards. Hirtensteiner, a three-time selection 
who hit .372 with 12 home runs and saved four games in relief, was named Player 
of the Year. Craven (10-2, two shutouts, 6-0 in conference) was named Pitcher 
of the Year, and Andy Lopez was named Coach of the Year in his first season. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola freshman Joe Ciccarella, who hit .328 shuttling between first base and 
the outfield, earned the other major award, Newcomer of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, who led the WCAC in hitting at .409, Hirtensteiner and Toole are 
repeaters on the first team. The Lions catcher bumped Santa Clara's Buckley, 
who was WCAC Player of the Year in 1988, to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
The first team is rounded out by DH Rod Nettnin, third baseman John DeRicco and 
utility man Don Angotti of Nevada-Reno and outfielder James Mouton of St. 
Mary's. The second team includes Reno first baseman Jeff Barry and pitcher 
Aaron Turnier and utility man Andy Roberts of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Berkeley men's tennis team is in the hunt for the NCAA title, thanks in 
part to singles player Forrest (Woody) Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The former South Torrance High standout, ranked 12th individually in the NCAA, 
will lead the third-ranked Bears in the NCAA Tournament next Friday at the 
University of Georgia. Hunt also teams with fellow senior Ted Scherman as the 
nation's second-ranked doubles team. The NCAA format, which takes eight days to 
complete, opens with team competition, followed by an individual tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, a two-time All-American singles player and an All-American doubles 
selection with Scherman last year, takes a 25-14 record and 16-9 dual record 
into the tourney. Hunt's national standing was augmented in April when he 
defeated Stanford star Jeff Tarango, 6-2, 6-1. Tarango, who avenged the loss 
last weekend, is ranked sixth nationally. Hunt has beaten him twice in the last 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
National ranking is nothing new to the 5-foot-10 senior. He was ranked fifth 
nationally as a junior (18 and under) and was the most heralded tennis recruit 
in the school's history. Hunt was a member of the Junior Davis Cup team in 
1987. That year, playing in the Transamerica Open, he defeated veteran pro 
Peter Fleming. At South High, where his father, Forrest Sr., teaches, Hunt was 
also an academic All-American, carrying a straight-A average. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior Hunt battled shoulder problems, and teammate Scherman had an ankle 
injury. This year, a healthier, more veteran Bears team -- which includes 
sophomore Pete Fitzpatrick out of Miraleste -- unexpectedly won the National 
Indoor Team Championships in February to vault into the national ratings. They 
could give top-ranked UCLA, Stanford and UC Irvine a run for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the sociology major plans to turn professional and play on the 
Canadian tour this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Can't-Tell-the-Players Dept.: In recent weeks, viewers of Loyola Marymount 
baseball have regularly seen several players take the field in Steve Surico's 
uniform, though the real Surico plays only when due to pitch. The answer to all 
the confusion, it turned out, came out in the wash. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Wall's road jersey and Mark Grafitti's home jersey were in a recent load 
of laundry but never came back. Since Wall and Grafitti generally platoon at 
the same position, they have been wearing pitcher Surico's uniform top. 
</P>
<P>
It gets more complicated when Surico pitches. Last weekend at Pepperdine, Wall 
wore Surico's jersey on Friday and Saturday. But Sunday, when Surico pitched, 
Wall came to the plate in Tim Byrne's uniform and was introduced as Byrne. The 
umpire turned to the press box and corrected the identification. Pepperdine 
sports publicist Mike Zapolski, manning the public address system, announced 
the change: "Correction -- now batting, Greg Wall, the man of many uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
Former USF and Boston Celtics star K. C. Jones was inducted into the basketball 
Hall of Fame this week, but it's safe to say Jones doesn't cause quite the stir 
of, say, Michael Jordan in public. 
</P>
<P>
At the recent West Coast Athletic Conference basketball tournament held at USF 
-- where he teamed with Bill Russell to win two straight national titles in the 
1950s and where their uniforms hang on the wall of the gym -- Jones was 
scouting for the Celtics and was barred from the press room by a student hired 
for security. 
</P>
<P>
A bemused witness asked her, "Do you know who that was?" She said no, but that 
he lacked the proper credentials. When told Jones' identity, she was red-faced. 
"That's embarrassing," she admitted. "I was just polishing the trophies in the 
K. C. Jones Room yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast Athletic Conference has hopes its top three baseball teams -- 
Pepperdine, Loyola and Santa Clara -- will be chosen for the NCAA regionals. 
Bids should go out around May 20 . . . Six Cal State Dominguez Hills softball 
players received all-conference honors in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn., with pitcher Denise Biller and utility player Jennifer Moen named to the 
first team. Pitcher Kim Park, third baseman Nicole Stelter, outfielder Maria 
Romero and shortstop Dina Graham were chosen for the second team . . . Romero 
has set a school season record for runs batted in with 27. She set the old 
record of 26 last year . . . Loyola basketball player Tom Peabody has one foot 
in a walking cast after surgery to remove pins from a previous bone graft 
operation on the ankle. Peabody will not be allowed to resume activity until 
around August . . . Dominguez Hills outfielder Marty Williams is hitting .413 
in CCAA play and .381 for the season. Outfielder Rob Campbell has 13 hits in 
his last 22 at-bats, raising his average to .353. He tied a school record with 
a five-hit game against Cal State Los Angeles . . . With one more start, Toros 
right-hander Rick Davis needs 14 strikeouts to tie the CCAA season record of 
170.

KENNEDY CLINCHES SECOND LEAGUE TITLE IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Standing between San Fernando High senior right-hander Frank Serna and a 
possible North Valley League title was Kennedy slugger Gino Tagliaferri, who in 
the third inning had blasted yet another home run. 
</P>
<P>
When Tagliaferri strode to the plate in the sixth inning Thursday with the 
bases loaded and the score tied, Serna flashed back to the third inning, when 
Tagliaferri had tagged Hector De La Cruz for his 11th home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought for sure he was going to hit No. 12 off me," Serna said. 
</P>
<P>
Serna (7-4) made the showdown elementary, however, by throwing away a pickoff 
attempt at first for an error, allowing the go-ahead runs to score as host 
Kennedy won, 7-5, to clinch its second consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
Serna's half-hearted throw to first eluded Andrew Munoz and allowed Danny 
Gugler and Mike Murray to score, breaking a 5-5 tie as Kennedy (18-7, 12-5 in 
league) moved 1 1/2 games ahead of the Tigers with one game remaining. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (16-6-1, 10-5-1) scored three runs in the top of the sixth with 
two out. Bobby Corrales' two-run single capped the rally and tied the score, 
5-5. STEVE ELLING

SOCKERS HOPE LATE FADES WON'T LEAD TO EARLY EXIT FROM PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dig back through a month and a half of Socker games and you can find what 
turned out to be the dress rehearsal for Saturday's semifinal playoff loss to 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Different team. Same score. Same result. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Diego Sports Arena March 22, the Sockers were sailing along with a 
4-2 lead when Wichita scored three goals in 1:38 to steal the victory, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
How familiar. 
</P>
<P>
The agony was longer Saturday, but the aftereffects may be of more consequence. 
Dallas scored three goals within 4:46 of the fourth quarter and won, 5-4, tying 
the series at one game each. 
</P>
<P>
So the Sockers have arrived for three games at Reunion Arena knowing this could 
be the last stop on their Major Indoor Soccer League title defense tour. 
Tonight's 5:35 game will be followed by games Saturday and Tuesday. If the 
Sockers lose them all, the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps their biggest immediate concern is a tendency to fade late in a game. 
Their record in overtime this season is 2-10, and lapses such as Saturday's 
seem to be most prevalent in the fourth quarter. Nobody is sure why. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we lose a little bit of focus late in the game when we get ahead," 
defender Kevin Crow said. "I think sometimes we want to play a little bit more 
freely before we put the game away. We get a little more individual and 
selfish. The point is not to get to the point where you allow them to tie. Once 
the game is tied, it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
The Sidekicks, who clearly don't measure up to the Sockers in terms of talent, 
are proving true to their reputation as a tireless team with a strong work 
ethic. By all rights, the Sockers should have won Saturday, but Dallas' players 
hustled to take advantage of each Socker mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas played with a lot of emotion," midfielder Brian Quinn said. "When we go 
to Dallas, if we don't match that, we'll be in trouble. We've just got to get 
the killer instinct back. It's far from over. It's going to be a long, 
drawn-out struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, as with team scoring leader Branko Segota, has yet to return to form 
after missing much of the second half of the season with a strained arch. 
Segota's hamstring has fully healed, Socker trainer Bill Taylor said. But his 
shot hasn't. Socker Coach Ron Newman said he is hoping to get more production 
from both players as the playoffs progress. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he might make changes in the lineup tonight. Chris Chueden, who 
didn't dress for Saturday's game, will make the trip and allow Newman more 
options in the midfield. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Saturday's loss might benefit the Sockers, serving as a 
reminder that Dallas is capable of scoring an upset in this series. The 
Sidekicks were the Sockers' first choice as a playoff opponent, but if 
overconfidence was a problem before the series began, it shouldn't be after 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"You should shake it off, but you should remember it," Crow said. "Hopefully 
we'll learn a lesson from it. I don't think we've turned up the intensity like 
the other teams have. That concerns me." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers are 2-2 this season in Dallas, winning, 2-1 and 7-1, and losing, 
4-3 and 5-3. Saturday's was the first Sidekick victory at the Sports Arena this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
With a laugh, Newman says the Sockers' biggest problem is this: "The 
commissioner allows them to have the same number of players in the playoffs as 
we do, and that's a pain in the (tail) sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game will be telecast live on Prime Ticket at 5:35 p.m. and tape 
delayed on XTRA (690) at 7:25 . . . Forward Steve Zungul leads the Socker 
offense in the playoffs with seven points -- two goals and five assists.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU, USD BOTH BEATEN IN NCAA TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The season ended in the second round of the NCAA championship tournament 
Thursday for both the San Diego State and University of San Diego women's 
tennis teams. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU was defeated by No. 1 Stanford, 9-0, and USD lost to host Florida, 6-1, in 
Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (17-10) won only one set, Michelle Apra defeating Kylie Johnson, 
6-3, in the first set at No. 6 singles. Johnson won following sets, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
The lone winner for USD (18-8) was Tonya Fuller, who defeated Florida's Holly 
Danforth, 6-1, 2-6, 7-6 (7-2) at No. 3 singles. 
</P>
<P>
John Cress and Hans Hoegstedt of Point Loma Nazarene advanced to the 
quarterfinals in singles and doubles at the NAIA District 3 men's championships 
at Westmont. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC is tied for third with Asuza Pacific, behind leader Cal Lutheran and 
second-place Westmont. 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans Saints picked up former San Diego State quarterback Todd Santos 
off waivers from San Francisco. While at SDSU, Santos broke 27 NCAA records. 
Most noteworthy was his 11,425 passing yards. Despite his college statistics, 
Santos was a 10th-round 1988 draft pick by the Saints, who released him at 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
USIU is in jeopardy of ending its season with a 14-game losing streak. The 
Gulls lost Nos. 11 and 12 in a row to No. 11 Cal Poly Pomona (40-21), 8-0 and 
2-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls (15-36-1) actually had a chance to score first, loading the bases 
with no outs in the bottom of the first. But they stranded the runners, and the 
doubleheader went downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
SIGNINGS

<P>
In other Metro Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista 4, Bonita Vista 3 -- Garland Phillips singled in two runs during 
Chula Vista's three-run sixth. Garrard Galvan (6-6) was the winner for host 
Chula Vista (9-13, 7-5). Bonita Vista is 12-14, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery 6, Marian 1 -- Luis Arroyo pitched the Aztecs to only their third 
conference victory. Last-place Montgomery is 8-14, 3-9. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado 1, Hilltop 0 -- Coronado (11-10, 6-6) scored one run in the fourth, 
but that was enough at Hilltop (8-14, 5-7). Andy Strasser picked up the 
victory, allowing just three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater 4, Southwest 3 -- Southwest scored twice in the seventh inning but 
stranded the winning run on base when Larry Meza struck out a Raider batter to 
end the inning. Sweetwater improved to 12-11, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar League 
</P>
<P>
Poway 11, Fallbrook 2 -- John Uglow pitched his third consecutive complete game 
and struck out five to improve to 4-5. Uglow also went two for three with three 
RBIs. Greg Sorrell collected four hits -- including a home run -- and two RBIs. 
Poway improved to 11-11, 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen 4, Vista 3 -- Host Orange Glen (11-13, 4-6) defeated Vista (15-6-1,

three for Orange Glen and -- with one out in the fourth and Orange Glen 
leading, 2-1 -- threw John Land out at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines 4, San Dieguito 3 -- With a puncture wound in his right foot and 
another in his left thigh, Ross Dixon came in to replace John Lynch when Lynch 
was ejected in the fourth. All Dixon did was come up to bat in the sixth with 
John Finley on second and deliver the game-winning RBI on a single. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado League 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual 6, Oceanside 0 -- Mike Escarcega struck out eight, and teammate 
Eric Marsh singled in two runs in a five-run fifth for San Pasqual (7-5, 16-8), 
which kept its faint playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 3, Ramona 0 -- Steve Valencia went two for three, and John 
Robirds drove in two runs as RBV (7-5, 14-10) won its fourth in a row.

EXXON, AT SHAREHOLDERS' URGING, VOWS NEW ENVIRONMENT POLICIES

Exxon said Thursday that it will appoint a person with an environmental 
background to its board and adopt new policies that its shareholders suggested 
in the wake of the Alaskan oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon said it also will recommend that its directors establish a committee to 
review corporate policies and programs related to worker safety and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Exxon said it will consider spending more money on environmental 
research and pollution prevention. About $5.5 billion has been spent in that 
area from 1970 to 1988, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes about a week after Exxon management met with 
representatives of New York City's pension fund, a large shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, who recommended the changes, said 
he was pleased by the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rather extraordinary development for a large American company," he said 
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Rothschild, a spokesman for the Washington consumer group Citizen Action, 
called the announcement nothing more than "a public relations window dressing" 
that will do nothing to improve the environment. 
</P>
<P>
New York City officials had said that three city pension funds owning 6 million 
shares of Exxon stock would vote against management at the May 18 annual 
shareholders meeting if the company failed to act on their recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
California's state employee pension fund, the nation's biggest, had indicated 
that it might back the New York group.

AMWAY TO SELL 2 AVON UNITS IF BID SUCCEEDS; 
</P>
<P>
GIORGIO, PARFUMS STERN PROCEEDS TO PAY OFF DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If Amway Corp. buys Avon Products, it will trade scents for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Amway, that is, will sell Avon's upscale fragrance subsidiaries -- Giorgio 
Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern -- if it succeeds in its $2.1-billion takeover 
bid for Avon. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Amway 
disclosed Thursday that it would unload its retail units mainly to pay off some 
of the debt from the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
For Giorgio and Parfums Stern, a sale would mark the second time they have 
changed hands in roughly two years. Long known for its "Avon Lady" direct sales 
force, Avon entered the department store market in 1987 when it bought Giorgio 
for $165 million and Parfums Stern for $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Based in Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
Giorgio's main fragrance, also known as Giorgio Beverly Hills, garnered sales 
of more than $100 million in 1988. It was the nation's top-selling fragrance 
offered exclusively in department stores. Avon in January introduced Red from 
Giorgio Beverly Hills and has predicted that the new product will produce $100 
million in new sales. The Giorgio business, now based in Santa Monica, employs 
about 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Avon retail division, including Giorgio and Parfums Stern but not 
the company's vast door-to-door sales operation, generated pretax earnings of 
$13.9 million on sales of $227 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Giorgio fragrance was introduced in 1981 and has been associated with its 
namesake, a boutique on Beverly Hill's Rodeo Drive. That boutique -- along with 
its original name, "Giorgio Beverly Hills" -- initially was retained by former 
Giorgio owner Fred Hayman when he and co-owner Gale Hayman sold the product to 
Avon. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with Avon, however, Hayman relinquished the name this year. 
Avon, which owns a boutique called Giorgio Beverly Hills New York in New York 
City, plans to open a Beverly Hills store under the Giorgio name later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejects Claims of Suit 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Parfums Stern also employs 200. Parfums Stern's brands include 
Oscar de la Renta, Perry Ellis, Valentino and Uninhibited by Cher, which was 
introduced in November. 
</P>
<P>
Avon had no immediate comment on the proposal to sell its retail group. 
</P>
<P>
Amway's SEC filing also rejected claims raised in a lawsuit Avon filed last 
week that was intended to stop Amway from acquiring more Avon stock. The 
federal suit alleges that the Amway-Jacobs partnership violated securities laws 
by failing to inform government agencies of its interest in Avon. Amway's 
filing said the complaint was "without merit." 
</P>
<P>
Ada, Mich.,-based Amway, which sells personal and household products 
door-to-door, proposed the $39-per-share buyout of Avon Wednesday, just one 
week after Amway and Minneapolis investor Irwin L. Jacobs disclosed that they 
had formed a partnership that acquired 10.3% of the New York-based cosmetics 
giant. Amway, however, is now making the buyout offer without Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Avon Chairman James E. Preston last week rebuffed the initial overture, saying 
that the company was not for sale. He reaffirmed that stance in a letter to 
Amway Wednesday, but said Avon's board would meet its legal obligations to its 
shareholders by reviewing the buyout proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Along with cutting its debt, Amway said it envisions divesting Giorgio and 
Parfums Stern because their products do not fit the strategic plans of Amway, 
which sells its products through an independent sales force and by catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Amway wants to concentrate on the distribution business," said Roanne 
Kulakoff, an Amway spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Amway would retain Avon's national and international direct sales operations, 
according to the SEC document. Amway also said Jacobs may explore buying 
Giorgio and Parfums Stern if its takeover goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts said there likely would be others interested in buying 
the businesses. Unilever PLC of Britain, Revlon Group and New Jersey-based 
Cosmair are among those that might be interested, said Bonita Austin, an 
analyst at Wertheim Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
"Giorgio and Parfums Stern are both valuable properties, but Amway would be 
crazy to keep them because they have no expertise in this area," Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the two subsidiaries 
together are worth about $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Uninhibited by Cher is expected to do well," he said, "and Giorgio and Oscar 
de la Renta are great values." 
</P>
<P>
The two subsidiaries have been key to Avon's business strategy, according to 
John Cox, an Avon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of our strategy is to become the world's leading provider of beauty and 
beauty-related products," he said. "To do that, you need to be in the retail 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Avon's 1.4-million-member independent sales force sells cosmetics, fragrances 
and small gift items for the home. A number of writedowns for discontinued and 
divested operations in retirement homes and health services contributed to 
Avon's 1988 loss of $404.5 million on sales of $3.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Amway's products include toiletries, cosmetics, soaps and home-care, health and 
fitness goods. A privately held company with 1 million independent 
distributors, it had sales of $1.8 billion in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 
1988.

Davis Offers Assurances: Marvin Davis assured Minnesota officials that he 
wouldn't fire Northwest Airlines workers or seek wage concessions. Davis gave 
his assurance in an effort to settle litigation over a Minnesota commerce 
commission ruling that prevented him from conducting a tender offer in 
Minnesota for NWA, the parent of Northwest. Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch 
said he would rule today on whether new details submitted by Davis satisfy 
Minnesota disclosure laws.

RECORD $4-BILLION RJR BOND OFFERING A SELLOUT; 
</P>
<P>
DREXEL PRICES ISSUE FOR QUICK SALE, ALLAYING FEARS IT WOULD SWAMP MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert said Thursday that it has found buyers for all of its 
record $4-billion offering of RJR Nabisco bonds, allaying fears that the issue 
would swamp the shaky market for "junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Portfolio managers and bond analysts said Drexel made the yields attractive 
enough to leave little doubt that they would find buyers. Drexel "priced it 
aggressively to get it done," said Tom Razukas, a high-yield bond analyst at 
McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei, a New York bond research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts contended also that the sale, to be completed today after 
approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, bodes well for the market 
in high-risk, high-yield junk bonds. Investors have recently sought safer 
havens after growing disillusioned with these relatively risky investments 
because of concerns about rising interest rates and fears of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the transaction said the offering was oversubscribed. 
</P>
<P>
The bond offering "was a $4-billion gorilla doing a cannonball into the 
swimming pool," said Raymond Minella, co-head of merchant banking at Merrill 
Lynch Capital Markets, a co-manager of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Minella added that the successful sellout of the RJR offering should free up 
money for other junk bond offerings "that was waiting on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
The junk bonds are key to the financing of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s 
recent record $25-billion buyout of RJR Nabisco. KKR has also said it plans to 
sell substantial assets to help fund the deal, as is typical in such leveraged 
buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Some investment bankers and executives of portfolio management companies 
praised the bonds as attractively priced and well backed by RJR Nabisco's 
assets and cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
"We're buying it in pretty good size for our clients," said Gerald B. Unterman, 
president of Solomon Asset Management in New York. "In terms of fundamentals, 
it's one of the better credits in the high-yield market." 
</P>
<P>
When companies price bonds, the goal generally is to come up with the lowest 
possible interest rate to keep down the costs of paying off debt holders. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel set the senior bonds in the RJR offering at 13.125%, while subordinated 
portions were set at 13.5% and 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Tennenbaum, Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.'s Los Angeles-based vice chairman 
of investment banking, said the deal will raise the overall standards for 
funding big buyouts. The RJR debt, he said, "was structured conservatively 
because people were worried about" successfully placing the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"This will clear out the pipeline now to get business back into a steady-flow 
state," Tennenbaum added.

Possible Bid for Dunkin' Donuts: Kingsbridge Capital Group, which announced 
last month that it had acquired a 7.6% stake in Dunkin' Donuts, said it wants 
to meet with Dunkin's chairman to discuss acquiring the firm and may offer $42 
a share, or $300 million. Shares of Dunkin' Donuts, which has vowed to remain 
independent, shot up $5.25 a share to $40 on news of the announcement before 
closing at $39.875. Kingsbridge is a unit of Unicorp Canada Corp. An arbitrager 
said the company could be worth $55 a share in a takeover, noting that it holds 
a dominant position in its industry and has had 15 consecutive years of 
earnings gains. Dunkin' Donuts has about 1,500 doughnut shop franchises in the 
United States that carry the firm's name and 221 shops abroad.

OIL PRICES HIGHER ON JITTERS ABOUT PANAMA PIPELINE 
</P>

The price of oil jumped more than 50 cents a barrel Thursday on the possibility 
that deliveries might be disrupted if Panama closes a pipeline that transports 
Alaskan crude to refineries in the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for delivery in June on the futures market jumped 54 cents to $20.06 
a barrel after reaching an early high of $20.25. Alaska North Slope jumped 56 
cents to $18.16 a barrel in the cash market where actual barrels are traded. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a possibility that (Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega could try to 
shut down the pipeline," said Nauman Barakat, vice president at 
Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is dislocation, there would be a tight supply, but I think the market 
is getting ahead of itself," said Andrew Lebow of ED&amp;F Man International 
Futures. 
</P>
<P>
But other oil industry experts said it was unlikely that Panama's 81-mile 
Petroterminale pipeline would be closed. "I don't think there's much 
possibility that the line would be shut down," said Charles Ebinger, an analyst 
with International Resources Group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said Thursday that the United States will send a brigade-size 
force to U.S. bases in Panama to augment military forces assigned there. 
</P>
<P>
London shipping brokers said early Thursday that there was no evidence of ship 
owners or charterers avoiding the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources estimate that the pipeline generates revenue of about $100 
million a year for the Panamanian government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pipeline Fees Frozen 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Northville Industries of Long Island, N.Y., operator of the 
pipeline, said pipeline fees were frozen in an account last year as part of a 
package of U.S. economic sanctions put in place after Noriega seized power. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Boston froze the pipeline fees in March, 1988, but 
Northville is permitted to continue paying its Panamanian employees. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said Thursday that economic sanctions would remain in force. 
</P>
<P>
Louis James, director of energy services for AUS Consultants in Philadelphia, 
said a Panamanian shutdown of the pipeline might trigger a wave of unrest among 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
If a shutdown should take place, Ebinger said, crude oil prices could jump an 
additional $1. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming the worst, it would be a dramatic market response similar to Prince 
William Sound," he said, referring to the March oil spill in Alaska that pushed 
prices up. 
</P>
<P>
But oil analysts said there are alternatives for moving the oil in the event 
the pipeline is closed, such as increased traffic through the Panama Canal or 
chartering very large vessels to ship the oil around South America. 
</P>
<P>
Ann-Louise Hittle, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said specially 
designed tankers holding up to 90,000 tons of oil could travel through the 
canal and unload on the eastern side of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gasoline Prices Jump 
</P>
<P>
She also estimated that there is 2.5 million barrels of storage capacity on 
each side of the pipeline, which translates into supplies for roughly eight 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Oil traders said they expected the price of West Texas Intermediate, the main 
domestic grade, to trade in the range of $19.50 and $20 once the excitement 
about Panama dies down. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices jumped a hefty 2.56 cents a gallon to 67.28 cents, while 
heating oil rose 1.20 cents to 48.68 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said Environmental Protection Agency approval of clean-air regulations 
that will make refining gasoline more expensive also pushed prices higher.

BUSLOAD OF CASINO WORKERS AT BRANCH OF AILING S&amp;L; 
</P>
<P>
VEGAS UNION PROTESTS GIBRALTAR LOANS 
</P>

<P>
A busload of Las Vegas hotel and casino workers whose contracts expire June 2 
traveled to a Los Angeles branch of ailing Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan 
Thursday to protest loans to casino operators that they say have helped stall 
wage talks. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar was taken over by federal regulators March 31 amid a wave of 
withdrawals by depositors. John Carr, who subsequently was named chief 
executive, expressed bafflement at the Culinary Workers Union's choice of the 
S&amp;L as a target. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand why they're demonstrating in front of our branch (at 404 
N. Fairfax Ave.)," Carr said. "We have no idea what they're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
The Las Vegas workers charged that otherwise profitable casinos, seeking to 
expand operations or to defend themselves from corporate raiders, have 
"mortgaged" their profitability by issuing "junk bonds" and taking on other 
debt. The casino operators claim that, because of this indebtedness, they 
cannot meet the contract demands made by Local 226 of the Culinary Workers 
Union, AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar in 1986 joined a group of financial institutions, the union said, 
that provided $118 million to finance acquisition of the Stardust and Fremont 
casinos by the Boyd Group -- a party to current wage-and-benefit talks. 
Gibraltar, the union charged, also loaned $3 million to two other Boyd-run 
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when Boyd had trouble making payments, Gibraltar exchanged part of its 
loan for more than $5 million in high-interest but risky junk bonds, the union 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Carr of Gibraltar said that the S&amp;L "has had no relationship with 
Boyd in two years" and that it holds no current loans to the group. 
</P>
<P>
Union spokesmen said the Los Angeles trip was made to call attention to 
rejection of the union's wage-and-benefit demands by the casino operators, who 
cite a high level of indebtedness. Local 226, which claims 28,000 members, is 
negotiating with 32 hotel-casinos in Las Vegas. The last contract negotiations, 
in 1984, resulted in a two-month strike.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: CONCEPT IS KEY IN APPAREL MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE

<TEXT>
<P>
Viken Momdjian, founder of Politix, a growing chain of European-inspired 
menswear boutiques, says the only way to break into the cutthroat apparel 
market is to have a totally new concept and as much control over the finished 
product as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have a new concept, don't do it," he bluntly advises. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Viken and his brother Asbed have opened 10 Politix stores around 
Los Angeles. The brothers attribute their success not only to their unusual 
styles and colors, but also to the fact that the parent company, Moba Inc., 
does everything for Politix from designing the stores to manufacturing the 
garments. 
</P>
<P>
While Viken Momdjian, who serves as president, runs the company from his 
Westwood office, Asbed lives in London, where he supervises an in-house staff 
of designers. 
</P>
<P>
Before considering a move into the apparel world, Momdjian suggests spending as 
much time as possible on your ideas, rather than rushing to open a store. "The 
more your brain works, the less your muscles have to work," he says with a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
To be successful, Momdjian believes, newcomers must not only have a striking 
concept to offer but also total control over certain factors. One is the 
ability to change colors and designs in the middle of a fashion season. Most 
retailers who carry several lines of clothing are limited to buying what is 
available at any given time. But, Momdjian said, this means you will be subject 
to the whims of others, perhaps unable to drop items that aren't selling well 
or unable to produce more of something that is. On the other hand, being your 
own manufacturer means dealing with another set of headaches, including labor 
and material costs. 
</P>
<P>
"You must have the flexibility and control to avoid dictation by others," 
Momdjian said in a recent interview in his flagship Westwood Village store. 
</P>
<P>
By acting as a manufacturer-retailer, Politix executives estimate that they 
save the consumer as much as 50% to 60% off other designer brands. The 
company's Panini line of sophisticated styles is designed in London and 
manufactured in Italy. The Sonneti casual wear line is also designed in London 
but sewn in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
They find that men are willing to pay more for unusual clothing. At Politix, 
cotton shirts sell for about $79 and suits are priced in the low $300s. And the 
company's loose-fitting, drapy look is definitely more Giorgio Armani than 
Brooks Bros. Momdjian, who is 41, said his clothes are designed for men 25 to 
49 years old who are "confident, relaxed, very independent and decision 
makers." 
</P>
<P>
He believes that men in Los Angeles, especially West Los Angeles, have embraced 
his avant-garde look. In fact, this year, Politix expects its U.S. sales to 
reach $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
Momdjian said he chose Los Angeles as the place to open his first stores 
because the city is becoming more cosmopolitan and sophisticated. "Los Angeles 
has an excellent environment -- the best in the world -- to do business," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Momdjian's life has been devoted to his quest for freedom -- freedom to 
live and do business the way he wanted to. His family's search for freedom 
began in the 1920s, when his father fled Armenia for cultural and political 
reasons. Since then, Momdjian, who was born in Syria, has lived in Lebanon, 
Cyprus, Egypt, Britain and finally America. 
</P>
<P>
"My father would always say, 'Don't look only to your store, let the world be 
your horizon,' " said Momdjian, who started in the men's clothing business at 
the wholesale level in London about 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Momdjian said he is ready to open Politix stores on the East 
Coast. And last week he decided to open a store in Cleveland. Although Momdjian 
said it is usually wives and girlfriends who bring men into Politix to shop, he 
has no plans to enter the women's clothing market. 
</P>
<P>
Momdjian laughs when asked how he and his brother came up with the name 
Politix. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been victimized by politics around the world," he said, referring to 
his family's flight from country to country as political climates changed and 
wars broke out. "It was an obsession with us. This time, we decided to have fun 
with politics, not sadness." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Small Business Leaders Meet With President 
</P>
<P>
Betty Jo Toccoli, the new president of National Small Business United, a 
grass-roots small business advocacy group, recently returned from Washington 
feeling upbeat about the Bush Administration's view on small business. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back feeling that people are not only listening to what small business 
owners have to say, but are very interested in us," said Toccoli, who was 
elected president of the group in February. Toccoli, president of Total One 
Development Center, a Los Angeles management training and consulting firm, is 
the first woman to be elected president of the 53-year-old organization. 
</P>
<P>
National Small Business United represents more than 54,000 small business 
owners and a network of regional small business organizations. She said her 
organization is different from most advocacy groups because all its lobbying is 
done by actual small business owners rather than by paid staff members. Most 
members have family businesses employing an average of 35 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Toccoli was among those representing 15 associations at a meeting 
with President Bush to discuss his federal minimum wage proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced that he will veto a compromise bill worked out by House and 
Senate negotiators that calls for a $4.55-an-hour federal minimum wage by 
October, 1991. The minimum is now $3.35, where it has been since 1981. 
California's minimum wage is $4.25. 
</P>
<P>
The President supports an increase to $4.25 by January, 1992. "We originally 
opposed any increase in the minimum wage, but decided to support the Bush 
proposal," said Toccoli. 
</P>
<P>
She said her members support Bush's plan, which calls for a "training wage" 
that would allow employers to pay new workers 85% of the current minimum wage 
for six months to reduce any job cuts that might result from increased costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The President definitely understands small business and small business 
issues," said Toccoli. "He asked good questions." 
</P>
<P>
Toccoli's organization is also working toward a revision of Section 89 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. The section, enacted as part of the 1986 tax reform, was 
supposed to eliminate discrimination by employers who were offering special 
benefits to executives and not other workers. 
</P>
<P>
Benefits such as executive dining rooms and paid parking were among the targets 
of the rule. But Toccoli said section 89, with its 180 pages of regulations, is 
incredibly costly and cumbersome to comply with. 
</P>
<P>
"Many businesses, big and small, threw up their hands and said we can't meet 
these regulations," she said, adding that some companies have actually cut 
certain benefit programs or forced employees to seek their own benefits in 
response to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
She and others are working with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) to substantially rework section 89 because it is "having 
just the opposite effect its authors intended." 
</P>
<P>
Toccoli has been active in small business issues for several years. Her 
company, founded 11 years ago, provides training and development programs for 
companies nationwide. It also helps firms set up employee benefit plans. In 
1988, her company received the Small Business of the Year award from the Los 
Angeles Chamber of Commerce.

SBA Will Conduct Seminar on Marketing 
</P>
<P>
A seminar on do-it-yourself marketing is scheduled for Wednesday at the Small 
Business Administration office, 350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 600, in downtown Los 
Angeles. The session runs from noon to 2 p.m. and costs $5 at the door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seminars to Be Held on Updating Minute Book 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday and May 20, Corporate Records Maintenance Service will host 
daylong seminars on how to update your corporate minute book. 
</P>
<P>
"Many business owners operate as corporations because they want to protect 
their personal assets from business debts and lawsuits," said Rebecca Staples, 
president of the company. "Unfortunately, many corporation owners have 
neglected the legal requirement of maintaining their corporate minute book." 
</P>
<P>
Staples said an up-to-date minute book is "essential to keep the IRS and 
creditors from piercing the corporate veil." The session, from 9 a.m. to 4 
p.m., costs $295. Both will be held at her company headquarters, 28038 Dorothy 
Drive, Suite 5, Agoura Hills. For reservations and information call: (800) 
423-8146.

PEOPLE: LEVITT WILL RESIGN AS HEAD OF AMEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arthur Levitt Jr. said Thursday that he was resigning as chairman of the 
American Stock Exchange after 11 years at the nation's third-largest stock 
market, which has attempted to stem the loss of business to its bigger Wall 
Street peers by expanding into innovative securities. 
</P>
<P>
Levitt, 58, said he would remain at the exchange until a successor is named, 
and that a search committee had been formed. He said he plans to build his 
3-year-old Levitt Communications Inc. into a larger publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the American Exchange today is stronger than ever in its history," 
Levitt told a news conference at the exchange in lower Manhattan. "I believe 
the staff is better, the quality of listed companies is stronger." 
</P>
<P>
The Amex, which caters to medium-sized companies, is far outpaced in volume by 
the New York Stock Exchange and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers' 
over-the-counter market traded electronically nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dates to 1790s 
</P>
<P>
Trading on the Amex grew from an average daily volume of 3.9 million shares 
when Levitt took over in 1978 to 9.94 million shares last year, but the number 
of companies traded has fallen to 895 from 1,004. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange dates to the 1790s, when its brokers traded unlisted securities on 
the streets of lower Manhattan while others moved indoors. It was the New York 
Curb Exchange until 1953, when its present name was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"Art has been doing this for 11 years. I think he's accomplished the goals he 
set out for himself," Jeffrey B. Lane, an Amex board member and president of 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said after Levitt's announcement. "I think he's 
leaving the exchange in a strong position." 
</P>
<P>
A committee of present and former members of the exchange board will choose a 
successor to Levitt. 
</P>
<P>
Under Levitt, the Amex introduced index options, including one based on an 
index of foreign stocks that begins trading Friday. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission also has approved plans for the trading of so-called baskets of 
stocks on the Amex. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange undertook the options innovations to open another avenue of 
business, although industry observers say Amex remains far behind the Chicago 
Board of Options in that area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Smaller Volume 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have carved out a very specific place in the U.S. for emerging 
growth companies, the mid-range companies," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Average daily trading volume of the Amex's 895 listed companies was 11.49 
million in April. Average daily volume is 161.9 million shares for the NYSE's 
1,680 listed companies and 133.3 million for about 5,080 issues traded on the 
national over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
The Amex in 1988 reported net income of $2.6 million from revenue of $102.8 
million, compared to profit of $8.3 million and revenue of $114.5 million in 
1987, Amex's most profitable year.

CARDILLO TRAVEL OWNERS TOLD TO PAY BACK WAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Culver City municipal court judge has ordered the husband and wife team that 
ran Cardillo Travel Systems when it suddenly collapsed 2 1/2 years ago to pay 
27 former employees $53,000 in back wages. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting their no-contest pleas, Judge Ronald Combast also placed A. Walter 
Rognlien, 77, and his wife, Esther Lawrence Rognlien, 47, on probation for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A. Walter Rognlien additionally pleaded no contest to a single count of failing 
to pay state withholding taxes. Assistant Dist. Atty. Wendy Forward said 
Rognlien agreed to pay the state $74,277, the total amount outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"What we started out wanting -- and what we got -- was restitution," Forward 
said. The Rognliens entered their pleas and were sentenced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Fife, attorney for the Rognliens, said the couple pleaded no contest 
because they thought Walter Rognlien was too old to withstand the rigors of a 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Fife said the Rognliens have already paid some of the ex-employees and that 
others have accepted Cardillo property, such as company cars, as payment. 
</P>
<P>
Rognlien acquired Cardillo Travel in 1956 and built it into one of the largest 
travel agencies in the country. It is now in bankruptcy court proceedings but 
at its zenith in 1981 served as the centerpiece of Rognlien's business empire, 
which included an auto parts distributorship, the Cozy Nook Fast Food 
restaurant chain and Icee USA, a shaved ice and syrup soft drink company. 
</P>
<P>
But Rognlien's mini-conglomerate was hurt by a family feud as well as dwindling 
profits at his travel agency. Some of his companies have been closed, and 
others, including Icee USA, have been sold.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices rose slightly Thursday in restrained trading that reflected 
uncertainties over news from Panama, the progress of a Treasury debt auction 
and an upcoming report on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 8.43 to 2,382.88. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 4 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 785 issues 
up, 602 down and 568 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
After an early selloff, the market moved higher behind strengthening bond 
prices, which rose on a Commerce Department report of lower-than-expected 
retail sales figures for April. The government said retail sales rose a modest 
0.4% last month. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the number pointed to a slower economy, giving the markets 
impetus to move out of their recent slump by signaling lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But activity remained subdued with investors awaiting the final day of the 
Treasury's $28.75-billion three-day round of borrowing. There was uncertainty 
over how a new glut of Treasury debt would be absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
Many market participants also withdrew in nervous reaction to President Bush's 
announcement that he was sending more troops to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"That kept some traders on the sidelines wondering what steps might be taken 
there," said Charles Jensen, technical analyst with MKI Securities Corp. 
"Otherwise, we might have had a better response." 
</P>
<P>
The market has spent most of the week waiting for April producer price numbers, 
which it hopes will provide a clearer indication of inflation in the economy. 
Observers said last Friday's jobless report confused investors, because while 
it showed higher unemployment and a slowing economy, it also showed that wages 
rose substantially in April, suggesting that inflation is still a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The producer price report is scheduled for release today. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Avon fell 3/8 to 39 1/2, Pan Am lost 
3/8 to 4 5/8 and IBM dropped 1/2 to 109 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton Hotels, meanwhile, surged 6 1/2 to 72 on news that the company would 
consider takeover offers. Block Enterprises also rose 1 1/8 to 27 3/8, and 
General Electric gained 1 1/8 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the main Nikkei stock index gained 89.14 to close at 34,08.49. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices closed mostly lower in an atmosphere of continued 
unease about possible labor actions. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times 100-share index finished 6.4 lower at 2,110.6. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose after three days of declines, aided by favorable inflation 
indications and what analysts called strong demand at a government securities 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose 15/32 point, or $4.69 per $1,000 face 
amount, after falling a total of about $15 earlier in the week. Its yield fell 
to 9.06% from 9.10% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on the 30-year bonds rose to 9.11%, up from 8.91% at the last comparable 
auction in February. It was the highest rate since 30-year bonds averaged 9.17% 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose 7/16 to 11/16 point, intermediate maturities rose 13/32 point and 
long-term issues were up 11/32 to 15/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a $1,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds closed up 1/8 at 91-31/32. The average yield to maturity dropped to 7.60% 
from 7.62% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.72% as the discount fell 7 basis 
points to 8.43%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.91% as the discount fell 9 
basis points to 8.42%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.03% as the discount 
fell 12 basis points to 8.37%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.69%, down from 9.75% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against most major currencies despite further evidence of a 
slowdown in U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose, partly in response to the tension in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.6655 late Thursday, down from late 
Wednesday's $1.6717. Sterling weakened against the dollar in New York, ending 
the day at $1.6645, compared to $1.6740 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Wednesday's late rates 
included: 1.9160 West German marks, up from 1.9020; 135.37 Japanese yen, up 
from 134.41; 1.7080 Swiss francs, up from 1.6921; 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up 
from 1.1843; 6.4755 French francs, up from 6.4220, and 1,395.75 Italian lire, 
up from 1,385.25. 
</P>
<P>
Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared to Wednesday's late rates, 
included: 1.9135 West German marks, up from 1.9047; 1.7060 Swiss francs, up 
from 1.6925; 6.4665 French francs, up from 6.4645; 2.1580 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.1500; 1,395.75 Italian lire, up from 1,390.125, and 1.1870 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.1849. 
</P>
<P>
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $379.40 an ounce, up 
from late Wednesday's bid of $376.60. Earlier, gold bullion for current 
delivery rose $3.30 to $381 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion prices improved slightly in Europe. Gold traded late in London, 
the major market, at $379, up from $377.25. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold rose 
to $378.20 from $376.75. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $377.25, down 
from $378.25. 
</P>
<P>
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.65 an 
ounce, up from $5.607 on Wednesday. Silver traded late in London at $5.66, down 
from $5.68. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures prices climbed back above $20 a barrel and petroleum product 
prices soared in a rally bolstered by President Bush's decision to send combat 
troops to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell, precious metals advanced, 
cattle prices rose and pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude settled 
unchanged to 54 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in June at $20.06 
a barrel; heating oil was 0.07 cent to 1.20 cents higher, with June at 48.68 
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.80 cent to 2.56 cents higher, with June 
at 67.28 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures ended sharply lower on the Chicago Board of Trade amid 
forecasts of rain and disappointment over the government's reluctance to 
subsidize a sale of U.S. soybean oil to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat and corn futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
After the markets closed, the Agriculture Department issued a report estimating 
1989 U.S. winter wheat production at a decade low of 1.43 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 1 3/4 cents lower to 1 1/2 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in May at $4.28 a bushel; corn was 1 1/2 to 3 1/4 cents lower, with 
May at $2.76 1/4 a bushel; oats were 1 1/2 cents lower to 1/2 cent higher, with 
May at $1.84 1/2 a bushel; soybeans were 6 3/4 to 10 1/4 cents lower, with May 
at $7.51 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Most cattle futures ended slightly higher in light trading after weakening 
earlier in the session. Pork futures settled mostly lower amid profit taking 
after two days of steep gains.

MOBIL SHAREHOLDERS REJECT CALL TO END S. AFRICA SALES

Although Mobil recently decided to sell its operations in South Africa, some 
stockholders at the company's annual meeting Thursday complained that it has 
not done enough to sever ties with the white-ruled nation. 
</P>
<P>
While they applauded the sales, representatives of religious groups and an 
official of New York City's pension fund pressed unsuccessfully for resolutions 
that would cut Mobil's indirect economic ties with South Africa and end sales 
of its petroleum products there. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mobil is pulling out of South Africa, then let it be a clean break," said 
Kenneth Sylvester, director of Investment Responsibility for New York's office 
of the comptroller. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil announced two weeks ago that it was selling its South African unit to 
General Mining Union Corp. for $150 million in cash, ending its role as the 
largest U.S. employer in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Bite, Loss Cited 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said a punitive U.S. tax law aimed at discouraging 
investment in South Africa had resulted, in effect, in 72% taxation. The sale 
will result in a book loss of $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil had long contended that its continued presence in South Africa would do 
more to combat apartheid than its leaving the country, and Murray voiced that 
sentiment again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We remain proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in South Africa in 
their contributions to economic and social programs for nonwhites," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray recommended that stockholders vote against the resolutions proposed by 
the activists, and his advice was largely heeded. Only 14.3% of Mobil's shares 
were voted in support of a resolution to sever all economic ties with South 
Africa, while 15.5% were voted to end all petroleum sales to South Africa's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed by the activists, Murray said Mobil's trademark could be used by 
Gencorp for as long as five years. 
</P>
<P>
The activists also said Mobil had broken a promise to consult with its local 
workers before the sale of the unit was arranged. Murray said that the workers 
will enjoy the same benefits Mobil had provided, and he added that Gencorp has 
promised not to lay off anyone for at least one year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personnel Arrangements 
</P>
<P>
Mobil has a staff of about 2,800 in South Africa, all but two of whom will 
remain there after the sale is completed in June. 
</P>
<P>
"An honest exchange of disagreement," Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity 
of Saint Elizabeth said after the meeting. She was one of a group who 
repeatedly questioned Murray about the terms of the sale and about Mobil's 
indirect ties with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The activists said they were asking Mobil to do more because its earlier 
announcement was so significant. 
</P>
<P>
"It will set a precedent in terms of remaining indirect ties and in terms of 
consultation with local workers about divestment," said Donna Katzin, speaking 
for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Company Remains 
</P>
<P>
Caltex Petroleum Corp, a joint venture of Chevron and Texaco, is the sole 
remaining U.S. oil company doing business in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, Jock McKenzie, chairman of Caltex Oil SA, said his company had no 
intention of leaving South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
He dismissed speculation that Caltex would follow the lead of Mobil and noted 
in a statement that motions calling for the withdrawal of Texaco and Chevron 
were overwhelmingly defeated in recent annual meetings of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, more than 170 U.S. companies have left South Africa under pressure 
from anti-apartheid groups.

MATTEL EXPECTS BARBIE TO BOOST '89 PROFIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Barbie, Mattel Inc.'s 30-year-old teen-ager, is expected to lead the Hawthorne 
toy maker to improved profits this year, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
John W. Amerman, chairman and chief executive, said at the company's annual 
meeting in Manhattan Beach that he expects sales of the best-selling doll to 
increase by $45 million to about $500 million this year. Each year, Barbie 
accounts for one-third to one-half of Mattel's $1 billion of sales. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said he expected significant sales gains from the company's line of 
Disney preschool toys, which brought in about $55 million in 1988, its 
introductory year. Amerman predicted a double-digit sales gain for the line. He 
said the company had "barely tapped" the international market, which accounted 
for $10 million to $20 million in Disney preschool toy sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company's second-quarter sales should "substantially exceed" the $207 
million reported for the same quarter in 1988, Amerman said. He said Mattel's 
earnings would exceed last year's results, but he declined to make predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said Mattel was unable to fill demand for some of its products during 
late 1988 and the first quarter of 1989 but that it was closing the gap. An 
inability to meet demand could result in Mattel losing potential sales. 
</P>
<P>
The company expects great things from its new "Power Glove," an electronic 
glove that allows children to play Nintendo video games just by waving their 
hands, Amerman said. The popular video game system is normally operated with a 
"joy stick" that is attached to the game console by a wire. 
</P>
<P>
The Power Glove, which is expected to retail for more than $60, is Mattel's 
only electronic toy offering this year. The company discontinued its highly 
touted electronic "Wheel of Fortune," which allowed at-home viewers to play 
along with the television game show, due to disappointing sales. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel -- which has also discontinued Baby Heather, its electronic baby doll -- 
hasn't changed its philosophy toward electronic toys, Amerman said. The success 
of electronic toys, he observed, depends on the "right timing." 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said Mattel is continuing a two-year project to develop an interactive 
compact disc player that would project movies and allow viewers to change the 
action. Competing toy companies, notably Hasbro Inc., have dropped their 
interactive video projects, declaring such toys too expensive to develop and to 
buy.

million to make up for cuts in government grants. The museum's director says 
funds are needed to offset an annual deficit of $158,650 and avoid closing 
galleries, cutting staff and charging admission. Entrance has been free since 
the museum opened in 1683. The museum is a department of Oxford University and

AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: 2 EXHIBITS GIVE IMPRESSIONS OF THE WORLD 
AROUND ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LEWINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two basic ways that artists convey their responses to the world 
around them. They act as observer/commentators and present their concerns in 
one way or another. Or, they engage the impact of experience upon their own 
lives and try to give expression to this. Two exhibitions in downtown San Diego 
exemplify these modes. 
</P>
<P>
Aida Mancillas-Doyle's delvings into spiritual and ecological experience are 
intensely personal, resulting in "Exiled Memories," a passionate cycle of 
paintings and "sculptural books" provoked by a visit to Mission San Javier del 
Boc, in Arizona. There, the artist encountered the bizarre blend of American 
Indian attitudes and imported Christian values typical of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The most distinct representation of the impact of that experience occurs in the 
text of certain of the "sculptural books:" hard bound books stiffened with 
wire, bordered 
</P>
<P>
with dried weeds, and painted white -- through which some of the original text 
faintly appears. The artist's text, which spans several books, tells a 
mystically tinged story of an old woman, of birds, of death, and, more 
generally, of the transformation of human experience from a nature-centered 
orientation to one marked by alienation between people and their world. 
</P>
<P>
A different type of sculptural book marked by black paint is expressive in 
purely visual terms similar to bas relief. A page of one of these combines a 
tiny ladder, a nail, and a small photo of a harvest scene. On the opposite page 
is a collage representing a woman imprisoned. A sea shell and a feather share 
her space behind the metallic bars. Another book combines a reed flute, a 
bird's skull, a sheaf of reeds, and a stylized image of two snakes intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
The collaged books are impressive in both their formal originality and their 
expressive power. This is even more the case in the paintings that complete the 
presentation. Some of these works resonate with Chicano styles. In others, 
however, the references to medieval illuminated manuscripts implicit in the 
collaged books become explicit. The formal structure, in which the frame is 
divided into distinct zones of imagery, readily recalls Romanesque and early 
Gothic pictorial styles. Even the dryness of the pigments and the stone-like 
representation of the figures echo this bygone art. 
</P>
<P>
With these allusions in the paintings, the entire experience of 
Mancillas-Doyle's presentation expands into broader cultural and spiritual 
concerns, at least as these can pertain to questions of the human place in the 
universe, i.e. the meaning of life. Thus, there abides within the form of the 
work a clash of styles and imagery which mirrors its source: the artist's 
observation of the clash of Native American culture with Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that Mancillas-Doyle embraces the Romanesque and Gothic, 
which bear an odd harmony with the "primitivism" of the native American 
cultures that affected her. Those were days in our own past when "we" lived 
quite primitively, both materially and spiritually, and, thus, not much 
differently than "them." That era in our history, which ended with the 
Renaissance, is called the Age of Faith. 
</P>
<P>
In the more recent, "modern" age, there's hardly any domain of experience more 
tenuously fulfilling than that of faith. With her art, Mancillas-Doyle reveals 
how she has been shaken up in the domain of faith. The result is like a door 
opened onto the deeper qualities of the lives we live, and a challenge to 
assess what we see there. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues at Sushi, 852 8th Ave., through May 27. Gallery hours 
are limited noon to 4 p.m., Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At the nearby Sonic Arts Gallery, Houston-based artists Michael Galbreath and 
Jack Massing, working together as the Art Guise, have put together a spicy 
summary of their encounters with San Diego. Titled "Talking Pictures," their 
effort reflects the observer/commentator mode of addressing the world outside 
of art and consists of 24 shiny metallic picture frames with junky tape 
recorders attached to them. 
</P>
<P>
These are commercial products aimed at people who want to send a low fidelity 
"hello" to Aunt Betsy or Cousin Bob. The recorder mechanism is attached to the 
frame and plays its message when tilted forward. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Guise use this bit of claptrap to produce cliched photographs of 
themselves on a golf course near the Coronado Bridge. They wear clothes 
purchased at a local thrift store and use a disposable camera to make the 
images. The recordings capture their musings on golf. Another group of photos 
portrays street people, accompanied by their verbal musings. 
</P>
<P>
A third group consists of things found in the street: a beer can, match books, 
and blooms from some flower. Street sounds accompany these. The fourth group of 
image/sounds relates to events in the news at the time of the Art Guise visit 
here. 
</P>
<P>
These "Talking Pictures" sit on shelves on the gallery walls. Motors drive 
brass rods which run behind the frames, alternately tipping them forward to 
release the recording. The result is a blaring cacophony that, at first, seems 
distracting, then amusing, then appropriately reflective of downtown life here 
or anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Like the environment that inspires it, the exhibition exuberantly indulges a 
flair for chaos and presents a real appreciation of the mixed bag of qualities 
of urban life. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues at Sonic Arts, 612 F St., through May 27. Hours are 
noon to 5 p.m., Thursday through Saturday.

FIRST PROP. 103 RULINGS DUE IN JULY -- GILLESPIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie on Thursday promised that she 
will make all of her decisions by Nov. 8 on whether to grant insurance 
companies exemptions from the rate rollbacks required under Proposition 103 and 
that the first rulings will come by late July. 
</P>
<P>
Outlining her procedures for deciding which, if any, rollbacks and premium 
refunds will be ordered, Gillespie said that she is notifying all insurers that 
they must either roll back rates to 20% less than 1987 levels by June 3 or file 
a detailed application with her department justifying a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
Under last week's state Supreme Court decision upholding most of Proposition 
103, insurers who apply for exemptions from the rollbacks can charge the higher 
rate they apply for, but if Gillespie eventually orders them to implement 
rollbacks, they will have to refund, with interest, any premiums they have 
collected above the levels she allows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Appeal Process 
</P>
<P>
The insurance commissioner noted, however, that any orders on rollbacks and 
refunds she may issue can be appealed by the insurance companies "all the way 
to the U.S. Supreme Court," delaying actual refunds to customers until long 
after the November deadline she set. 
</P>
<P>
Subject to the rollback provisions of Proposition 103 are lines of insurance 
ranging from those covering automobiles, boats, plate glass and other property 
to polices guaranteeing mortgages, providing liability protection and covering 
legal malpractice. This includes all homeowner and auto policies sold in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, Gillespie announced that in order to allow the 
Insurance Department to perform all the new regulatory functions it has been 
given under the initiative and by the Supreme Court, Gov. George Deukmejian has 
approved a budget increase for next year of $24.1 million as well as 263 new 
staff positions. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Legislature, that would mean the department would have $59.5 
million to operate in the 1989-90 fiscal year and its staff would increase to 
788. The department is generally funded by levies on the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Supreme Court decision, Gillespie must use as her standard a "fair 
and reasonable" rate of return for each company in determining whether the 
rates they submit are allowable or whether rollbacks and refunds will be 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Thursday, she declined to give a specific figure for what she would 
consider a fair rate of return, saying it would vary company by company 
depending on such factors as the degree of risk it was assuming, its return on 
equity and its income from both premiums and investments. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no one number for fair return," she said. "Companies are very 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said that following the court order, she would not consider any past 
surpluses a company may have gathered as a factor in deciding if a rollback was 
merited. In short, she said she would not penalize a company now for its 
profits in the past. 
</P>
<P>
She said she would rule on what constitutes a fair return for each line of 
insurance offered by each company applying for exemptions and would not lump 
the lines together for a single determination. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the insurance commissioner said she reserves the right to decide on a 
partial rollback, should the "fair return" line fall somewhere between the 
Proposition 103 rollback level and the rate the company wants to charge. This, 
she noted, could result in one company, for example, being ordered to roll back 
auto insurance rates 4%, while another insurer was ordered to implement an 8% 
rollback. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie suggested she would apply a "harsher" standard on the companies 
during the rollback hearings and deliberations than she would after Nov. 8, the 
deadline for the department beginning full rate regulation of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
She said this was because under the rollback procedures established by the 
Supreme Court, a company must first demonstrate that the Proposition 103 
rollback levels would be "confiscatory" in nature. Only after the Insurance 
Department makes that finding will the company be allowed to argue that the 
rates it is charging bring a fair and reasonable return. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, insurance industry attorney Allen M. Katz pointed out in an 
interview that the Supreme Court, in a footnote to its decision, had stated 
that the "confiscatory" and "fair and reasonable" standards are "not separate 
tests." Accordingly, Katz suggested that Gillespie is not legally entitled to 
apply a "harsher" standard on insurers now than she will use later. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, meanwhile, released detailed financial forms each company must fill 
out to apply for exemptions from the rollbacks. Although she said that about 
100 companies have already conveyed their intention to apply for exemptions, 
all will have to start their efforts anew by filling out the forms. 
</P>
<P>
The information requested, Gillespie said, is aimed at discovering, with much 
greater precision than in the past, just what happens to each dollar in premium 
a customer pays. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also told the insurers that under public disclosure 
requirements of Proposition 103, they must provide a copy of their applications 
to members of the public who request them. 
</P>
<P>
Companies filing an application for exemptions will be required to pay a 
minimum of $2,500 to the department for processing and more may be charged them 
if the processing takes a lot of time, Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she will submit emergency regulations for conducting hearings on 
rollback exemptions to the California Office of Administrative Law next week 
and that a hearing will be held on permanent rules in early August. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite simply, we're in business," Gillespie said. "We've been planning for 
months to move on the different Proposition 103 decisions that might have been 
handed us by the court. We're excited. It's a big job, but we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
As the commissioner spoke, about 20 pickets from the Voter Revolt organization, 
sponsors of Proposition 103, marched outside, demanding that she resign. One 
demonstrator carried a sign saying, "Prop 103 is here to stay, Roxy get out of 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, a leading sponsor of Proposition 
103, had called on Gillespie to step down, terming her "irreversibly prejudiced 
. . . against any fair implementation of the refund provisions." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about this Thursday, Gillespie said she will be "completely fair" and 
"independent" in doing her job. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say to Ralph Nader and anybody else is, 'Read the court's decision,' 
" the commissioner said. "We're going to do exactly what they say." 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Gillespie said, the "paramount" consideration will be an 
awareness that "urban voters really would like to pay less for auto insurance. 
. . . I'm going to stay close to that goal and for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
She said that when Proposition 103 is fully in effect next November, with rate 
regulation and other features, a driver's record rather than the territorial 
rating system, under which inner-city residents, particularly in Los Angeles, 
have been charged the highest rates for auto insurance, will be the prime 
factor in rate-setting. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the resulting savings to Los Angeles residents will not be enough to 
make insurance affordable, she said. Other steps will be necessary to reduce 
the costs of insurance, she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
First reaction from the industry and consumer advocates to Gillespie's remarks 
Thursday was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
George Tye, a spokesman for the Assn. of California Insurance Cos., the 
industry's leading lobbying arm in Sacramento, said the industry was pleased 
that Gillespie was acting quickly to decide on the rollbacks, and that from her 
statements it recognizes that it is "entirely possible" that she will 
eventually order some rollbacks and refunds. 
</P>
<P>
Tye said he could not say whether such orders would be appealed to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt, questioned whether the "fair rate 
of return" standard followed by Gillespie will be "a rate of return for a 
reasonably efficient company or a reasonable rate of return for the typically 
wasteful, fat or greedy company." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield said he was disturbed that Gillespie did not consult with Voter 
Revolt and independent consumer advocates in establishing her procedures and 
that he will soon submit a public records request for every meeting she may 
have had with insurers in developing such procedures. 
</P>
<P>
A more favorable reaction came from Steven Miller, head of the Insurance 
Consumer Action Network, a group that is often represented at Insurance 
Department hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite pleased with what she said," Miller said. "It's frankly more than I 
expected." But Miller said some issues may remain between consumers and the 
commissioner over the precision of data she is requesting from the companies 
seeking exemptions.

AIDE TO WRIGHT QUITS IN WAKE OF ASSAULT STORY

<P>
John P. Mack, top aide to embattled House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), resigned 
Thursday in an effort to save Wright and House Democrats further embarrassment 
from newspaper accounts of his brutal assault on a young woman 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation clearly was designed to head off a growing public protest 
against Wright and Mack by many irate women -- including House Republican women 
-- who objected to a man with his criminal background earning $89,500 a year on 
the public payroll. 
</P>
<P>
But Mack's departure underscored just how seriously the Speaker has been 
weakened by allegations of ethical wrongdoing. Although Mack's crime has long 
been known to most House members, it had never sparked an outcry until Wright 
got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Mack also is a close friend of Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), the House majority 
whip, who has strongly defended Mack against criticism, even describing him as 
being like "a brother." Coelho and Mack have investments in a computer software 
firm in Merced. Separately, Coelho's personal investments have come under some 
scrutiny recently as a result of his 1986 investment in junk bonds marketed by 
Drexel Burnham Lambert, the controversial brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Mack controversy arose last week when Pamela Small, the victim of Mack's 
crime, gave an interview to the Washington Post detailing how in 1973 -- when 
Mack was 19 -- he beat her on the head with a hammer, stabbed her in the breast 
with a steak knife, slashed her throat and left her for dead in the back of her 
own automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Now 35, Mack said in a written statement that he is "truly sorry" for the 
attack, which he said would always cause him to feel remorse. "I wish I could 
rewrite the past," he declared, "but unfortunately I can't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Connection 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker, in a separate statement, said he was unaware of the brutal details 
of Mack's crime when he hired the young man as a $9,000-a-year filing clerk in 
the mid-1970s. At the time he was hired, Mack, who had served 27 months of a 
15-year sentence for the crime, had a family connection to Wright. Wright's 
daughter was married to Mack's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he offered Mack a job on the recommendation of his daughter, who 
had known Mack in high school. He said he also was assured by the sheriff in 
nearby Fairfax County, where Mack had been jailed, that he had been "a model 
rehabilitative prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker indicated that he offered Mack the job after he had served his jail 
sentence. According to Small's account, however, Wright offered him the job 
even before he was sentenced and Mack's attorney mentioned it repeatedly in an 
effort to win a lighter term for his client. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he accepted Mack's resignation with "sadness and regret," but Mack 
said he had been thinking about leaving the Speaker's office for another job 
before this controversy arose. 
</P>
<P>
Although the case had no direct connection to the charges of ethical misconduct 
pending against Wright, it clearly compounded the Speaker's problems. Many 
House members reported receiving telephone calls from women constituents who 
were outraged by the story and related it to the Speaker's other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) said many people grasp the import of the Mack case 
more readily than they do the complex ethics rules case against Wright. "I 
think this has tended to personalize the Speaker's problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of Republican women House members, led by Rep. Olympia J. 
Snowe (R-Me.), were preparing a letter to Wright on the subject when Mack's 
resignation was announced. Snowe said the women legislators believed that a man 
with Mack's criminal background should not be involved in writing the law. 
</P>
<P>
"He violated the law; he didn't serve his sentence, and he didn't make 
restitution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Post account said the attack had no apparent motive. Mack, then an employee 
of a suburban Washington import store, brutally attacked the woman customer 
after they went into a storeroom to look at window blinds she had said she 
wanted to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho also came under criticism from some House members for his strong defense 
of Mack. But Coelho declined to discuss the matter Thursday after Mack 
resigned. Instead, he issued a one-sentence statement saying: "I regret what's 
happened to John Mack and his family, but I respect his decision." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Coelho was quoted in the Ft. Worth (Tex.) Star Telegram as 
saying that Mack first told him of his crime during a dinner together. He said 
he then responded with "concern for John" and believed that Mack will always 
pay a price for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Their financial disclosure statements say Mack and Coelho have invested money 
in a limited partnership in Merced known as DMA, a firm that supplies computer 
software to dairy farms. The stock held by both is valued between $5,000 and 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, who grew up and still lives in suburban Virginia, also has invested in 
rental apartment units in Merced, Coelho's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
David Dryer, spokesman for Coelho, said none of these investments resulted from 
the friendship between Mack and Coelho. Instead, he said, Mack has made the 
investments on the advice of Don Ozenbaugh, a Merced accountant that he and 
Coelho use. He said Ozenbaugh met Mack at a Democratic fund-raiser several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Thursday that Wright was encouraged to 
invest $100,000 of borrowed money in a Texas nursing home chain after the 
operator of the firm, T. R. Jewell, came to Washington to lobby the Speaker. 
Jewell, who could not be reached for comment, also reportedly introduced Wright 
to the officials of a bank where he borrowed the money. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Johnson, spokesman for the Speaker, denied the suggestion that Wright 
sought to take financial advantage of a person seeking his support for 
legislation. "Wright was the scam-ee, not the scam-er," he said.

SOVIETS PLAN TO WITHDRAW 500 WARHEADS; 
</P>
<P>
GORBACHEV ALSO CALLS FOR MUTUAL CUTBACKS OF FORCES IN EUROPE

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in the kind of surprise move that has 
become his trademark, told Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Thursday 
that he will withdraw 500 nuclear warheads from Europe and will seek cuts of 
more than 2 million troops from the NATO and Soviet Bloc armies, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's announcement, made during a Kremlin meeting on the second day of 
Baker's two-day visit to the Soviet Union, came as part of a concerted effort 
by the Soviet leader to pressure the United States toward negotiations over 
short-range nuclear weapons -- an issue that has increasingly divided the 
Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev challenged Baker directly to bring the United States into talks on 
battlefield nuclear weapons, but the secretary of state, repeating the Bush 
Administration's position, refused. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't negotiating," said a senior Baker aide who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze called the U.S. position "very 
negative" and told reporters, "This is of grave concern to us." 
</P>
<P>
The continued deadlock over short-range nuclear forces had been expected, but 
Gorbachev's promise to withdraw 500 warheads unilaterally was clearly intended 
to dramatize the issue. Baker aides noted ruefully that the move would almost 
surely sharpen the already worrisome division within the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization between the United States and West Germany, which has called for 
early negotiations on battlefield nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Baker sought to play down the significance of Gorbachev's gesture. "It's a good 
step, but a small step -- a modest move toward a more equal balance in Europe," 
he told reporters on his plane leaving Moscow on Thursday evening. "I'd like to 
also point out . . . that NATO has unilaterally reduced nuclear weapons in 
Europe by more than 2,400 weapons since 1979." 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. officials noted that the Soviet Union is believed to have as many as 
10,000 short-range nuclear warheads in Europe, so that a cut of 500 may 
represent only 5%. But they acknowledged that the Soviet leader appeared to 
have scored another coup in the continuing East-West battle for public opinion 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Vintage Gorbachev," said one. "He's extraordinary," sighed another. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had half expected such a move, they said, but the specific form 
came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the continuing disagreement over short-range weapons, both Soviet and 
American officials said they are pleased with their talks -- Baker's first 
full-scale meeting with Soviet officials since President Bush was inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very satisfied," Baker said after his talks in the Kremlin, which included 
3 1/2 hours with Gorbachev. Asked whether the talks had helped end the Cold 
War, he replied, "We're certainly moving in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
"We made a good start on a long road," Shevardnadze said. But he added that the 
Soviet government is still impatient with the Bush Administration's slow start 
in arms control, which he called "the center of gravity for U.S.-Soviet 
relations." 
</P>
<P>
"The secretary of state told us that the United States has not yet prepared 
specific negotiating positions, but stressed in these new positions we would be 
able to see a substantial degree of continuity (from the Reagan 
Administration)," Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
The two did agree to resume the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) on 
long-range nuclear weapons, along with negotiations on nuclear testing and 
other issues, in mid-June, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But they postponed any talk of a first summit meeting between Gorbachev and 
Bush until the fall, making a summit unlikely before December. Meanwhile, the 
issue of short-range nuclear weapons will clearly remain a major point of 
contention, not only between Washington and Moscow but between the Bush 
Administration and several of its European allies as well. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say NATO's forces need the weapons -- nuclear missiles, 
artillery shells and bombs carried by tactical aircraft with ranges under 300 
miles -- to counterbalance the Warsaw Pact's larger numbers of troops and 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
But both the Soviet Union and West Germany have called for early negotiations 
to reduce the number of such weapons, most of which would explode on German 
soil if they were ever used. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is scheduled to meet today with West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher to discuss the issue -- only hours before Genscher is to 
welcome Shevardnadze on a well-timed visit to Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze described Gorbachev's decision to withdraw the 500 warheads only 
vaguely as "some unilateral measures covering the reduction of tactical nuclear 
arsenals in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
But a U.S. official aboard Baker's plane described it as "a very small 
reduction for them." 
</P>
<P>
He said Gorbachev told the Americans that the weapons would include 284 
short-range missiles, 166 nuclear bombs carried aboard short-range airplanes 
and 50 nuclear artillery shells, for a total of 500. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the withdrawal would still leave the Soviet Bloc with more 
tactical nuclear weapons and larger conventional armed forces than the Atlantic 
Alliance, and thus would not affect the U.S. position of rejecting negotiations 
on short-range weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's announcement that he will propose massive cuts in military manpower 
on both sides came as part of a new, more detailed Soviet proposal for the 
current Vienna talks on conventional forces in Europe, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told Baker that he will soon propose a troop ceiling of 1,350,000 for 
each military alliance in Europe, they said. NATO estimates its forces at 2.2 
million and Warsaw Pact forces at 3.1 million; Gorbachev's proposal could mean 
a cut of 850,000 NATO troops and more than 1.7 million Soviet Bloc troops. 
</P>
<P>
Using NATO estimates, that would be a reduction of about 38% in NATO forces, 
and about 54% for Soviet Bloc forces. The Soviet Bloc estimates that NATO and 
its own forces have roughly equal numbers of troops, and with those figures, 
Gorbachev's proposed cutback would mean cuts by a similar percentage on both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also said he plans to call for a 55% reduction in NATO strike 
aircraft and helicopters; scrapping 40,000 Warsaw Pact tanks, to bring both 
sides down to an equal ceiling of 20,000; and similar cuts in other combat 
vehicles and artillery, to be implemented by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Those proposed cuts in conventional armed forces had already been suggested -- 
without the details -- by Shevardnadze at the opening of the Vienna conference 
in March. But Gorbachev's announcement appeared likely to increase pressure on 
the West to be more flexible in the talks. NATO has proposed more modest cuts 
of up to 10% in conventional weapons but has not included aircraft or troops in 
its proposals. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials noted that Moscow could unilaterally carry out the withdrawal of 
500 nuclear warheads, but that the proposals for troop reductions and other 
cuts would have to be negotiated at the Vienna talks. The Soviet proposal is 
expected to be formally presented in Vienna today. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev unveiled his proposals in the middle of an unusually long meeting 
with Baker in the Kremlin's ornate St. Catherine's Hall, U.S. officials said. 
First, Baker met alone for an hour with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, handing 
them a letter from President Bush expressing U.S. support for Soviet economic 
and political reforms. Then, after another hour of talks at a long table with 
half a dozen senior aides on each side, Gorbachev said, "I want to give you an 
advance look at some proposals I'm going to make," and outlined his plan 
animatedly -- without notes. 
</P>
<P>
Baker did not respond specifically to either proposal, they said, although he 
engaged Gorbachev in a lengthy debate over the imbalance of both conventional 
and tactical nuclear forces. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, both Baker and Shevardnadze said they made progress on finding 
points of agreement on Central America, although the Soviets did not accede to 
a U.S. request to halt aid to the Marxist regime in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to work toward a political and diplomatic solution to the problem of 
Nicaragua," Baker said, without providing any details. 
</P>
<P>
And in the Middle East, he said, "We think there may be a fair amount of common 
ground." U.S. officials said they are heartened by the Soviets' willingness to 
discuss seriously Israel's current proposal for elections among the 
Palestinians of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Both foreign ministers said they had established a new personal rapport, in 
part during a private dinner which Shevardnadze and his wife held for Baker and 
his wife, Susan, in their Moscow apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good personal relations are being established between the foreign 
ministers of the two superpowers," Shevardnadze said.

AIDS OVERWHELMING S.F. SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
SURGE IN CASES, OTHER FACTORS MAY SIGNAL TROUBLE ELSEWHERE 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city's pioneering system of compassionate, cost-effective AIDS care is 
being overwhelmed by an unexpected surge in new cases, longer-living patients, 
dwindling charitable contributions and burnout among volunteers and staff. 
</P>
<P>
The "San Francisco model," which harnessed the altruism of thousands of 
volunteers to minimize the hospital stays of patients, has been widely 
emulated, and city officials believe its woes portend trouble elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid we are showing the rest of the country where they are headed," said 
Dr. Tom Peters, San Francisco's associate health director. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous difficulties at a number of community-based AIDS organizations, 
along with projections that worse times lie ahead, are forcing local officials 
to ask fundamental questions about the long-term viability of the 
much-acclaimed model. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there have been renewed calls for the state and federal 
governments to take on a greater share of the burden of caring for AIDS 
patients, a solution that proponents say might head off similar emergencies in 
other parts of the country -- especially those that have not mobilized against 
the disease like San Francisco has. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the AIDS Emergency Fund slashed its maximum cash grant to 
recipients to $100 from $1,000, the Shanti Project turned away 50 patients 
seeking housing, and the respected director of the San Francisco AIDS 
Foundation announced his resignation, citing exhaustion and funding woes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are entering an era of scarcer resources," said Timothy Wolfred, who will 
step down June 30 after four years as head of the agency. Earlier this year, 
the foundation laid off 11 of its 80 staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, city health officials counted 193 new AIDS cases in March and an 
additional 207 in April. Both figures shattered records for a single month and 
dashed hopes that new cases would plateau at or slightly above last year's 
monthly average of 133. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that about 10% of the March and April cases reflect more 
stringent monitoring by the Health Department. But that does not come close to 
accounting for the big jump, which was based on exposure to the human 
immunodeficiency virus that occurred years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Transmission of the virus has fallen to about 1% a year among homosexual men, 
because of widespread adoption of safe-sex practices, and stands at about 3% a 
year among intravenous drug abusers. Still, about 25,000 San Franciscans are 
infected and without effective treatments will probably get sick over time. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a city that has become numb to bad news about AIDS, the latest monthly 
totals were "horrifying," said Pat Christen, director of public policy for the 
AIDS Foundation. "All of the city's AIDS organizations are in crisis," added 
Christen, who will become interim director of the agency July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like a tidal wave," added Eric Rofes, executive director of the 
Shanti Project, where private donations fell 8% during the first quarter. 
Shanti provides emotional and practical support to people with AIDS, and its 14 
residences provide housing for 52 of the city's 2,300 living AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I could fill another 14 residences tomorrow," Rofes added. 
</P>
<P>
At the AIDS Emergency Fund, a charity funded by events in the gay and lesbian 
community, treasurer David Bell said "nine years into the epidemic, the 
community is becoming tapped out." 
</P>
<P>
Still, as AIDS patients live longer -- and exhaust their savings and health 
insurance coverage -- more of them are seeking grants from the fund to cover 
rent, utility bills and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
At Shanti, "we are seeing more dementia and other neurological impairments" as 
treatments that prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a leading killer of 
AIDS patients, come into wider use, Rofes said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco health officials and AIDS leaders have been scrambling to find 
new sources of money to keep the system functioning. "It is important to 
remember that the collapse of the model would not save money in the long run," 
noted Associate Health Director Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a California Department of Health Services study released earlier this 
year showed that the state Medi-Cal program spent about twice as much per AIDS 
patient in Los Angeles as in San Francisco. The average hospital stay was 9.5 
days in San Francisco, compared to 13.3 days in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to overstate the value of the contribution made by family, 
friends, neighbors and lovers," Peters said. "It is now time for the federal 
government to explicitly assume the responsibility for patient care, as it 
would in any other type of natural disaster," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rofes of Shanti has called a conference of Northern California AIDS experts 
next month to examine "ways in which the San Francisco model is outmoded, or 
how it might be buttressed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteers Needed 
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop strategies to enlist older people, students, and housewives 
as volunteers," said Rofes, a veteran of AIDS service organizations in Los 
Angeles and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
And in another effort to ensure the viability of AIDS care in San Francisco and 
throughout California, a group representing major AIDS services organizations 
met here last Friday to consider options including statewide or local ballot 
initiatives to fund AIDS and other health-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a tough spot," said meeting organizer Mark Cloutier, executive 
director of the National Public Health Project Against AIDS, who noted that the 
overall state budget faces a $1.6-billion shortfall next year and that federal 
AIDS expenditures for patient care are only expected to grow slightly. 
</P>
<P>
The group hopes to form a coalition with other "disease lobbies" and 
health-care providers and go directly to the voters to seek higher excise 
taxes, perhaps on alcoholic beverages.

GIRL DECLARED BRAIN DEAD HAS PREMATURE BABY BY CESAREAN

A brain-dead teen-ager sustained by life-support systems since March because of 
a thorny legal dispute over the fetus she was carrying delivered the baby by 
Cesarean section Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Marie Rivera, 15, and her daughter were in very critical condition after 
the procedure, officials at San Bernardino County Medical Center said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanya's parents, George and Alice Rivera of San Bernardino, were 
wrestling late Thursday with whether to remove their daughter from the machines 
that have kept her alive since she was shot in the head and declared brain dead 
nearly two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been here all night," said nursing supervisor Joy Flint. "They go from 
the girl's side to the baby and back again. They're trying to decide what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials have said there is no hope for Tanya. The prognosis for her 
newborn, who is having trouble breathing because of poorly formed lungs, is 
poor, Flint said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya, an attractive girl with shoulder-length brown hair, has been hooked to 
artificial support systems since she was shot once in the head March 15, 
allegedly by her boyfriend. The 16-year-old youth, who is the father of the 
baby and has not been identified, has been ordered to stand trial in Los 
Angeles in an unrelated homicide. He has not been charged in Tanya's case. 
</P>
<P>
The Riveras, who are divorced, initially had requested that their comatose 
daughter be allowed to die. Hospital officials refused, and the medical 
center's director won a court-ordered guardianship of Tanya over her parents' 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
In court filings, San Bernardino County officials sought to block termination 
of life sustaining care for the girl, citing rights of her fetus. They argued 
in court documents that termination of care for Tanya "would be tantamount to 
aborting the fetus." 
</P>
<P>
The county attorneys argued that Tanya's wishes were unknown, the fetus had a 
heartbeat and the law governing such cases is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said they were reluctant to disconnect life-support systems 
because they were unsure of their legal liability. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, the case attracted the interest of abortion foes. Protests came 
from the Right to Life League of Southern California as well as a statewide 
organization of physicians opposing abortion, who wrote a letter critical of 
the Riveras and urged the court to appoint a guardian for Tanya. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino County also stepped in, advocating 
that the fetus be saved and threatening to intervene legally in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began Contractions 
</P>
<P>
A San Bernardino Superior Court judge was scheduled to hear arguments in the 
case Monday. But on Wednesday morning, Tanya began experiencing uterine 
contractions. Medication stopped the contractions temporarily, but they resumed 
late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
By morning, the fetus was showing signs of distress and the decision to perform 
a Cesarean section was made, said Charles Jervis, director of the medical 
center. Tanya was taken to the operating room at 10 a.m. and the baby was 
delivered 25 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
The infant, who weighed about five pounds and was seven weeks premature, is in 
the neonatal intensive care unit. She suffers from hyaline membrane disease, a 
deficiency of the chemical that normally coats the sacks in the infant's lungs, 
and appears to have brain damage likely related to bleeding or infection during 
gestation. 
</P>
<P>
Although unusual, the San Bernardino case is not the first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1986, a baby was delivered in Santa Clara by doctors who had sustained 
the brain-dead mother for nearly eight weeks in order to allow the fetus to 
develop. The parents of the mother, Marie Odette Henderson, had wanted to 
terminate artificial support, but the father went to court and won an order 
protecting the fetus. He was later granted custody of the infant. 
</P>
<P>
In a related court case in February, New York state's highest court denied an 
appeal by anti-abortion activists seeking to prevent a Long Island man from 
having an abortion performed on his comatose wife.

HOUSE OKS MINIMUM WAGE RISE TO $4.55; 
</P>
<P>
VOTE INVITES CLASH WITH BUSH, WHO BACKS HOURLY RATE OF $4.25 
</P>

<P>
The House, setting the stage for a confrontation with President Bush, on 
Thursday approved a measure increasing the federal minimum wage to $4.55 an 
hour by 1991. Bush, who supports an increase to $4.25, has vowed to veto any 
legislation providing for a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
On a 247-172 vote, the House passed a final version of the measure and sent it 
to the Senate, which is expected to endorse the legislation next week. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, who sponsored the increase to $4.55, fell short of the 289 votes 
that would be needed in the House to override a presidential veto. Still, they 
predicted a tough fight over the issue and taunted Bush for refusing to support 
their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Three Thin Dimes' 
</P>
<P>
"What this all comes down to is three thin dimes, that's the difference between 
us and the President," said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). "We're talking about 
helping the millions of people who work but live in poverty and giving them a 
living wage." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans shot back, however, that Bush supported a 90-cent increase in the 
minimum wage, from the current $3.35 rate to $4.25. The President "supports an 
increase of nine fat dimes and that shouldn't be forgotten," said Rep. Bill 
Goodling (R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
Under the House legislation, the minimum hourly wage would increase to $3.85 on 
Oct. 1, 1989, to $4.25 in 1990 and to $4.55 by 1991. The current hourly rate 
has not been increased since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In a compromise intended to satisfy concerns voiced by Bush, the measure would 
allow employers to pay new workers a training wage not less than $3.35 per hour 
or 85% of the minimum wage rate, whichever is greater. Employers could pay the 
subminimum wage to all new workers until their individual experience in the 
work force totals 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Both Democrats and Republicans agreed that the minimum wage should be 
increased. But they clashed over the impact of the proposed $4.55 hourly rate. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual use of props, Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) held aloft different 
glass bowls filled with dimes to compare the increase called for in the 
Democratic-backed measure with the increases in salaries earned by public 
officials and business executives. 
</P>
<P>
One bowl, containing 400 dimes, illustrated the $40-per-hour increase in the 
vice president's salary called for in recommendations made by Bush, he said. 
Another bowl, holding three dimes, showed the difference between Bush and 
Democrats over the proposed increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of elemental fairness for the working poor of this country," 
Wright said. "These are people who work, and they pay taxes. They do work that 
most people don't want to do, and they deserve better treatment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Purchasing Power 
</P>
<P>
Other sponsors noted that the cost of living has increased 40% since 1981, 
while the purchasing power of the minimum wage has decreased nearly 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"It is astonishing to me that George Bush is using the full power of his 
presidency to keep poor working people from earning an extra 30 cents an hour," 
said California Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae). "I can't understand anyone 
who says our nation can't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Republicans predicted that the $4.55 hourly rate would cause employers 
to eliminate nearly 670,000 low-paying jobs across the nation and said that 
Democrats were playing politics with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a futile exercise and everyone here knows that," said Rep. Thomas E. 
Petri (R-Wis.). "The President will veto this, and his veto will be sustained. 
Those in favor of this hope only to score a few political points, and I doubt 
whether they will even do that."

SENATE PANEL NARROWLY BACKS U.S.-JAPAN FSX FIGHTER DEAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday narrowly backed a proposal 
for the United States and Japan to jointly develop and produce the FSX jet 
fighter for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, estimated to be worth up to $8 billion, has generated sharp criticism 
on Capitol Hill over technology and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) was among the nine committee members who voted 
against a resolution to disapprove the FSX deal; eight members voted for it. 
The vote cut across party lines. 
</P>
<P>
Action then shifted to the Senate floor, where FSX opponents voiced hope they 
will be able to muster majority support despite their defeat in the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.) said: "I am encouraged by the closeness of this 
vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which a week ago -- considering 
the (Bush) Administration's strong push in favor of this deal -- seemed out of 
the question." 
</P>
<P>
During debate on the Senate floor, Dixon said that despite recent assurances 
that U.S. firms will receive a 40% share in the FSX project and that sensitive 
technology will be protected, "this is still the same old deal -- a bad, bad, 
bad, bad deal for America." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a 
supporter of the FSX, said he hopes that when a new agreement is negotiated 
several years from now covering production of the plane, those talks will be 
marked by a atmosphere of "mutual trust and fairness." 
</P>
<P>
A resolution of disapproval also has been introduced in the House. However, 
even if both plans are passed, a two-thirds majority in both houses would be 
needed to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would jointly develop and 
produce the fighter, an advanced version of the American F-16, for use by Japan 
in the late 1990s. General Dynamics is based in St. Louis, but most of the FSX 
work would be done at its F-16 plant in Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
Other senators speaking out against the FSX included Sen. Richard H. Bryan 
(D-Nev.), who said transferring U.S. aircraft technology to Japan would help 
that nation's aerospace industry compete with the United States and thus amount 
to "sowing the seeds for a future economic disaster."

HE WON'T TAKE PREMIER JOB, ITO TELLS TAKESHITA

Masayoshi Ito, the ruling party's choice to succeed Noboru Takeshita as Japan's 
prime minister, informed Takeshita today that he will not accept any offer to 
take over as Takeshita's successor. 
</P>
<P>
Ito, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's executive board, told 
the outgoing prime minister that any further delay in making his position clear 
would create an "imposition" on the ruling party. He also asked that a meeting 
of the party's chief executives be called later today to allow him to make his 
decision known to them. The decision left the ruling party with no clear choice 
for a new leader. 
</P>
<P>
Ito's move came during a three-hour meeting over dinner Thursday after he 
presented demands to Takeshita for reforms that he insists the party adopt 
before choosing a successor. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting between Ito, who is 75 and diabetic, and Takeshita 
since the prime minister announced April 25 that he will resign because of a 
scandal that has touched all the party's recognized leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Viewed as Sole Choice 
</P>
<P>
Ito, although lacking a personal following, had been regarded as the only party 
figure untouched by the scandal who commands enough respect to lead the party. 
</P>
<P>
Details of his demands were not disclosed, but the two leaders said they agreed 
that a conclusion to the scandal must be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Takeshita told Parliament that his resignation is only his "personal 
conclusion" to the scandal, in which Recruit Co., an information and real 
estate conglomerate, dispensed stock and campaign contributions to 168 
politicians, businessmen and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita denied he was involved in anything illegal, but he acknowledged that 
his aides received more than $1.5 million from Recruit in stock profits, 
contributions and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Ito has demanded dissolution of the party's factions -- groups of Parliament 
members who pledge loyalty and obedience in exchange for funds that factional 
leaders distribute to them. He has complained that the Liberal Democrats, 
instead of committing themselves to reform, have focused their attention on 
gaining factional power within the new party structure and the new Cabinet that 
will be chosen after Takeshita steps down. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita said he will leave office after the fiscal 1989 budget is approved, a 
step expected no later than May 28. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, spokesmen said, told Ito that immediate dissolution of the 
factions is impossible. They said he proposed that reforms be studied to 
transfer power gradually from the factions to party organs. 
</P>
<P>
The two agreed to work out details of a reform package before choosing a new 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Takeshita said he is prepared to ask party members in the legislature 
who profited from Recruit stock to "return their gains to society." He said he 
will return profits that an aide and a relative obtained in transactions in 
1986, when he was finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita has agreed with Shintaro Abe, the party secretary general, that his 
successor should be given a full two-year term as party president -- the 
president of the ruling party is also prime minister -- and not be considered 
the head of a caretaker government. 
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll by the newspaper Asahi found that only a quarter of the 
voters said they would vote for Liberal Democratic candidates if an election 
were held now. But no election for the powerful lower house of Parliament, 
which chooses the prime minister, is expected before July, 1990.

Most of the military units being sent to Panama by President Bush in "Operation 
Nimrod Dancer" are rapidly deployable and schooled in the peculiar political 
and military terrain they are likely to encounter in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
The initial wave of deployments to Panama will bring more than 1,000 lightly 
armed foot soldiers into Panama quickly. But a second wave of troops will 
introduce both heavier firepower and the kind of armored transportation that 
U.S. troops will need to evacuate civilians, if the violence in Panama's 
streets escalates. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of 1,881 U.S. troops to 10,000 already in place in Panama, 
U.S. forces would be better able to repulse an attack on U.S. bases and the 
Panama Canal should the Panamanian Defense Forces try to mount an assault, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twofold Mission 
</P>
<P>
"They are combat troops. They are there to protect American lives and, if 
necessary, to protect the Panama Canal," said National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft. But Scowcroft added that the troops also will be used to exercise 
"one of the important treaty rights . . . the right of unimpeded travel for 
official convoys and troops throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
One defense official said that while the troops probably will travel on some 
Panamanian streets, "they're not there to bait anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Two battalions from the Army's 7th Light Infantry Division and a company from 
the Marine Corps' 2nd Expeditionary Force -- a total of 1,055 troops expected 
to begin arriving by today -- have trained extensively in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, when forces of Nicaragua's Sandinista government allegedly made 
incursions into Honduras, the Reagan Administration dispatched two battalions 
of the 7th Light Infantry Division to Honduras in an "emergency readiness 
exercise" called Operation Golden Pheasant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Routinely Sent to Area 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the Marine Corps' 2nd Expeditionary Force, ordered to leave Camp 
Lejeune, N.C., immediately for Panama, are routinely sent to the troubled 
Central American nation, where they hone their skills in fighting brush-fire 
wars at the Army's Jungle Warfare Training School there. 
</P>
<P>
Both units are among the military's quick-reaction forces that can move to 
trouble spots lightly armed and highly mobile. While the Army's light infantry 
moves by foot or hitches rides on local trucks and helicopters, the Marine 
Corps company gets around in light armored vehicles -- specially designed 
eight-wheel dune buggies armed with a 25-millimeter machine gun as well as a 
7.62-millimeter machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
The 7th Infantry Division, formed in 1985, is one of four active-duty U.S. 
light infantry divisions created by the Army since the early 1980s. Its ranks 
of 10,700 -- smaller than mechanized divisions of about 17,000 -- are swelled 
with many more riflemen than in the Army's more heavily armored divisions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Firepower 
</P>
<P>
But it is the addition of an Army mechanized infantry battalion -- a total of 
726 soldiers from Ft. Polk, La. -- that will bring big guns and heavy armor to 
Panama within a few days. Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said that the troops 
and 59 armored personnel carriers, six mortar carriers and 106 support vehicles 
will arrive via cargo ship in two to three days. 
</P>
<P>
"They're taking some lighter forces and putting them in with some backup," said 
Jeffrey Record, a senior fellow with the conservative Hudson Institute and a 
specialist in the tactics of Third World warfare. "And if the situation 
continues to deteriorate, the Ro-Ro (roll-on/roll-off ship) is on the way" with 
heavier equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Their first mission is to protect the facilities in case there's a run on 
them," said Record. "They obviously want to have a great deal of mobility on 
the ground, which they'll get in spades when the battalion from Ft. Polk gets 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Record said that if the tension escalates still further, the Pentagon may wish 
to send additional helicopter units to Panama to increase the troops' firepower 
and mobility. Pentagon spokesman Howard said that the United States has 
"substantial (helicopter) resources already on the ground in Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Among those, said Ft. Ord spokesman James Davis, is a 200-man chopper unit from 
the 7th Division which trains regularly in Panama.

By ordering fewer than 2,000 U.S. troops to Panama, President Bush hopes to 
intensify pressure on Gen. Manuel A. Noriega without touching off a nationalist 
backlash either in Panama or the rest of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said they do not expect the action to force Noriega 
out of power any time soon, if at all. They also acknowledged that the various 
steps outlined Thursday by Bush constitute a minimal response to the fraud and 
violence that marked Sunday's aborted Panamanian election and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials and non-government experts agreed that the Bush program 
avoids the dangers inherent in a more forceful response. The President's plan 
was carefully measured to avoid feeding Latin American concern about Yankee 
interventionism. 
</P>
<P>
Although the soldiers and Marines being sent to Panama are combat-ready, Bush 
made it clear that their mission is to reinforce American troops already in 
Panama to protect American citizens and safeguard the Panama Canal. He made it 
clear that the forces will not intervene directly in Panama's political 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the President reaffirmed his support for the Panama Canal 
Treaties, which call for the United States to turn over full control of the 
canal to Panama at the end of this century. By rejecting the suggestions of 
some members of Congress that the United States abrogate the treaty, Bush 
avoided an action that non-government experts said would almost certainly turn 
public opinion in Panama against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"One must commend the President on not letting emotionalism run American policy 
as it did in the Reagan Administration," said Eva Loser, a Latin American 
policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 
Washington. "It was important not to overreact and to stay within legal 
boundaries. The (Noriega) regime's propaganda machine has been charging that 
the United States wants to abrogate the treaty. Bush did not play into their 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latin Support Seen 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger added in a television 
interview: 
</P>
<P>
"The Latins are always going to be edgy about our response in the sense that 
they are always worried about intervention in the internal affairs of states in 
Latin America. In this particular case, however, I think it's fairly clear that 
there is going to be almost universal condemnation of Noriega's (election 
fraud), and I think we will find very substantial Latin American support for 
our response." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, U.S. action often has produced a nationalistic reaction throughout 
the region, with Latin Americans closing ranks behind nations facing a 
challenge from the north. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is expressed in terms of the United States against Noriega, that's a 
no-win situation for us," said Wayne S. Smith, adjunct professor of Latin 
American Studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International 
Studies. "The lead has to be taken by the Panamanians themselves and by the 
other Latin American governments." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said there is not much Washington can do by itself to dislodge Noriega, 
short of an invasion. But he said Noriega's position can be gradually eroded if 
Latin American nations join the United States in isolating Panama. 
</P>
<P>
In outlining his program, Bush was careful not to promise early results. And 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, asked in a briefing if it would be 
acceptable to the United States if Noriega is still in power a month from now, 
replied: "I don't see why not." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Administration hinted it might take more forceful action 
later, with Bush saying, "If required, I do not rule out further steps." 
</P>
<P>
"This has to be a prelude to something," said Linda Robinson, an associate 
editor of the prestigious quarterly Foreign Affairs and an expert on Latin 
America. "They have to be seriously discussing the military option at this 
point."

7 LATIN NATIONS CONDEMN VOIDING OF VOTE 
</P>

<P>
Latin America's major democracies Thursday condemned the Panamanian 
government's nullification of its election as a step that moves Panama "even 
further from the democratic community of Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
The seven countries reiterated, however, their commitment to "nonintervention 
and self-determination" in Panama, an apparent reference to intense U.S. 
efforts to drive Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, from power. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the Group of Eight, now composed of just seven countries since 
Panama's suspension in February, 1988, issued a joint communique that said, in 
part: 
</P>
<P>
"We declare our profound consternation at a situation that can distance the 
government of Panama even further from the democratic community of Latin 
America at a historic moment when free, popular expression advances in an 
unprecedented manner in our region." 
</P>
<P>
Although the seven nations remain sensitive to U.S. intervention in domestic 
political issues, they also are wary, based on long experience, of attempts by 
the region's armed forces to interfere in politics. Argentina, which has 
presidential elections Sunday, has weathered three military uprisings in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who heads the Panama Defense Forces, is the de facto ruler of Panama. 
His regime nullified Sunday's election after international observers accused it 
of widespread voting fraud on behalf of Noriega's favored presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The group of Latin American nations, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, 
Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, has emerged as a significant regional 
voice. Four of the seven -- Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay -- returned to 
democratic rule in the 1980s after military dictatorships. 
</P>
<P>
Some Latin American officials had criticized the United States for failing to 
consult and seek joint action last year after Noriega, in effect, deposed 
then-President Eric A. Delvalle. President Bush phoned several Latin American 
leaders Wednesday to consult with them on the current situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disastrous and a Disgrace' 
</P>
<P>
In Buenos Aires, Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, the current president 
of the U.N. General Assembly, declared bluntly to reporters that the Panamanian 
election was "disastrous and a disgrace. I hope the new (electoral) process, 
which should be initiated as soon as possible, will have the necessary 
guarantees to allow (democracy) to be consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
"What has occurred in Panama seems impossible and unacceptable, to the point 
where the Panamanian authorities have seen themselves obligated to annul these 
elections,". 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine election will bring the nation's first transition from one 
elected leader to another in 61 years. With civil liberties entrenched since 
the restoration of democracy in 1983, there are no concerns about fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Andres Perez, the recently elected Venezuelan president, said he feels 
profound concern over developments in Panama, and he expressed Venezuela's 
"solidarity with the legitimate election results, which represent the majority 
will of the Panamanian people." 
</P>
<P>
Perez criticized the interference of the Panamanian armed forces in the vote 
count and "altering" of the results. He said Latin American countries are 
consulting on possible options, and he called for an emergency meeting of the 
Organization of American States to consider possible action. An OAS statement 
in Washington said the meeting will be held today. 
</P>
<P>
In Havana, the Cuban Foreign Ministry denounced any possible U.S. military 
intervention in Panama, saying such an action would create "an inevitable and 
explosive reaction among the people of our (Latin) America." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the European Community condemned the annulment of the 
election, saying the move implied "the non-acceptance of the sovereign will of 
the Panamanian people," Reuters news agency reported from Brussels.

CONFEREES ADOPT $1.17-TRILLION 1990 BUDGET WITH DEFENSE CUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Senate and House negotiators agreed Thursday on a $1.17-trillion budget for 
fiscal 1990, a spending plan that constrains the Pentagon, treats many domestic 
programs generously and leaves many prickly decisions for later. 
</P>
<P>
On their second day of public meetings, bargainers from Congress' two chambers 
agreed by a unanimous voice vote to accept the proposal, which claims to leave 
a deficit of $99.7 billion. Both houses are expected to give final approval to 
the document next week. 
</P>
<P>
On May 4, the House and Senate mustered comfortable bipartisan majorities to 
pass separate but similar spending plans, each of which reflected the budget 
deal completed last month between the Bush Administration and congressional 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators from the two chambers had little difficulty reconciling 
differences over spending priorities, which were slight. The House agreed to 
the Senate's higher spending totals for energy and commerce programs, and the 
two chambers compromised on education, health, law enforcement and community 
development initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Middle ground also was found in the $28 billion the package claims in deficit 
reductions for next year. The Senate agreed to reduce the $2.7 billion in 
savings it sought from the Medicare program to $2.3 billion, an amount expected 
to come from lowered payments to doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan allows $299.2 billion in defense spending, $4.2 billion less 
than the amount needed to keep up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But many decisions will have to be made later. The makeup of $5.3 billion in 
additional tax receipts must be determined.

WHITE HOUSE AGREES TO NEGOTIATIONS ON GLOBAL WARMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House, in an apparent softening of its position on a major 
environmental problem, has dropped its opposition to a formal 
treaty-negotiating process on global warming, it was learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the United States had been alone among major Western economic powers 
in opposing such an initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The change of position was outlined in a cable dispatched Thursday to U.S. 
delegates at an environmental conference in Geneva sponsored by the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Saying it was essential for the United States to exercise a leadership role, 
the cable said, "We should seek to develop full international consensus on 
necessary steps to prepare for a formal treaty-negotiating process." 
</P>
<P>
It said the United States would be willing to host a workshop on global warming 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The cable, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press, was sent by 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, who earlier had rejected efforts to 
put the United States in the lead in establishing an international convention 
on global warming. 
</P>
<P>
The convention idea had been supported by Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly. But Sununu 
had argued that a convention was premature and that more analysis was needed of 
economic and other effects of the potentially dramatic actions needed against 
global warming, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temperatures Could Rise 
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that global temperatures could rise 4 degrees to 9 degrees 
Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century because increasing levels of 
carbon dioxide and other man-made gases in the atmosphere will trap and retain 
heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Such a warming trend could melt polar ice caps and cause sea levels to rise, 
cause severe droughts and storms and severely disrupt the Earth's biological 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at a Senate hearing on Monday testified that the problem might be 
worse than their own computer programs can predict. 
</P>
<P>
The White House had ordered one of the scientists, James E. Hansen, director of 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space 
Studies, to change his testimony to avoid the impression "that there is 
unanimity within the government on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
In his cable, Sununu said, "We consider the reported emerging agreement on an 
advanced preparatory program to address global climate response issues 
comprehensively to be extremely positive. 
</P>
<P>
"To further this process, please make every effort to obtain agreement on a 
global warming workshop this fall, hosted by the United States," Sununu said. 
</P>
<P>
He said such a meeting "should be designed to identify the scientific, legal, 
technical and economic issues critical to further progress on beginning 
negotiations on an international convention on global climate change."

WOODY SHAW, 44; JAZZ TRUMPETER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woody Shaw, the trumpeter who lost his left arm in a freak subway accident in 
February and who had been plagued for years by blindness, died of kidney 
failure Wednesday in a New York City hospital. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, whose 1978 recording of "Rosewood" was voted the No. 1 jazz record in the 
nation, had tumbled down a stairway Feb. 27 onto the tracks in a Brooklyn 
subway station where a train struck him, severing his arm. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where his condition deteriorated and he was 
stricken by pneumonia. Although his pneumonia abated, he continued to suffer 
kidney pain and died of kidney failure, said his father, Woody Shaw Sr. 
</P>
<P>
In April, jazz musicians from throughout the country held a benefit concert for 
the trumpeter, whose deteriorating health had forced him to return last fall to 
his parents' home in Newark, N.J., from Europe where he was a top attraction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assumed Throne 
</P>
<P>
Influenced by both Clifford Brown and Freddie Hubbard, Shaw was considered 
Hubbard's successor in the 1970s as the leading practitioner of his instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Feather, in his "Encyclopedia of Jazz," notes that Shaw -- who headed a 
quintet -- had become more personal in his playing and had moved away from 
chords into "a controlled freedom." 
</P>
<P>
"After two choruses I get tired of playing the changes, and I think that's the 
difference in today's music and, say, 10 years ago," Shaw said in 1972. "I like 
to superimpose harmonically. I like to play it deliberately in another key and 
resolve it." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw played with most of the giants of modern jazz, including Eric Dolphy, 
McCoy Tyner, Horace Silver, Dexter Gordon, Archie Shepp, Lionel Hampton, Jackie 
McLean, Hank Mobley and Booker Ervin. The Shaw discography includes more than a 
dozen albums. 
</P>
<P>
Before falling ill last year, Shaw had been living in Bern, Switzerland, and in 
Amsterdam, teaching at several jazz schools and touring with various jazz bands 
in Europe, most recently the Paris Reunion Band last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Alto saxophonist Bobby Watson, who shared the bandstand with Shaw during their 
years as sidemen with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, said Shaw had adjusted to 
the loss of his eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
"The blindness didn't mean nothing to him," Watson said. "He has a photographic 
memory. He hears a piece of music one time and memorizes it." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz producer George Wein said he felt some sense of relief that Shaw's 
troubles were over. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a blessing," Wein said after Shaw's death. "The poor man was blind, the 
poor man was a narcotics addict, the poor man lost his arm. He had more tough 
luck than any human being I've ever known."

MAX GORDON; VILLAGE VANGUARD FOUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Max Gordon, who since 1935 ran a celebrated cellar in New York City called the 
Village Vanguard, died Thursday at the age of 86. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, considered the patron saint of New York jazz, entered a New York 
hospital Wednesday night for a gallbladder operation and died shortly after 
midnight of complications from surgery, friends of his family said. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from many of the giants of jazz who had worked his world-famous room 
was instantaneous. 
</P>
<P>
"He was truly a friend to the musician," United Press International quoted 
drummer Max Roach as saying. Roach, who remembered sneaking into the club as a 
youth by drawing a mustache across his upper lip with eyebrow pencil, said "all 
the musicians loved Max Gordon." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon came to the United States five years after he was born in Lithuania in 
1903. He studied writing at Reed College in Portland, Ore., but decided that he 
wanted to live in Greenwich Village. He briefly attended law school at Columbia 
University and then worked a series of odd jobs before scraping up the cash to 
open what was eventually to become the Vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, he started another club, the swank Blue Angel, where chanteuse Edith 
Piaf made one of her first U.S. appearances, and ran it until it closed in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Village Vanguard, from which Gordon took the title of his 1980 
book, "Live at the Village Vanguard," that remained closest to him. 
</P>
<P>
At a birthday celebration in March, 1988, Gordon was roasted for his lack of 
financial acumen ("In 50 years this place hasn't made a dime," noted comic 
Irwin Corey) and toasted for his devotion to music. Mel Lewis, the drummer and 
band leader who has played for more than two decades at Gordon's club, noted in 
the New York Times that "after 22 years ours is not a business relationship but 
like father and son. . . . The Village Vanguard is a house of culture and he's 
its master." 
</P>
<P>
The small triangular club at 178 7th Ave. has been a haven for classic jazz (as 
opposed to fusion, which Gordon detested) for about half its history. 
</P>
<P>
Before the mid-1950s, it was home to beat poets, musical revues (including one 
featuring Judy Holiday) and folk singers (Leadbelly, Josh White, Pete Seeger 
among others). It also was a showcase for comics Woody Allen, Mort Sahl and 
Lenny Bruce ("I used to pay him $3,500 a week," Gordon said. More than I paid 
anybody at the time.") 
</P>
<P>
Gordon was a fixture at the Vanguard well into his 80s, telling Who's Who in 
1987: "I am still operating the Village Vanguard. It is open every night. The 
New Yorker calls it 'the greatest jazz club in the world."' 
</P>
<P>
Sue Mingus, the widow of bassist Charles Mingus, said she could not imagine the 
intimate club without him. 
</P>
<P>
"Max has been in there every night, even if he's asleep in his bedroom 
slippers," she said. "His wife, Lorraine, said she thought at first of closing 
down for the night (after his death) but then she said, through her tears, 'Max 
would be saying, "How are we going to pay the musicians and the bar bill?' "

AUTOPSY FINDS AIDS VIRUS IN BODY OF SACRAMENTO EDITOR, CORONER SAYS

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sacramento County coroner has determined that C. K. McClatchy, chairman of 
the McClatchy chain of newspapers, was infected with an AIDS-causing virus at 
the time of his death April 16. 
</P>
<P>
However, the cause of McClatchy's death was heart failure, and there were no 
signs that he was suffering from AIDS symptoms when he died, a spokesman for 
the coroner said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman confirmed a report published Thursday in the Sacramento Union 
that coroner's officials tested for the presence of the HIV virus, which causes 
AIDS, after investigators learned from medical records and interviews that 
McClatchy may have suffered earlier from "an AIDS-related disease process." 
</P>
<P>
The test showed the presence of antibodies to the virus, a sign of infection, 
but McClatchy was not found to have the unusual skin cancer or infections 
associated with AIDS. "He did not have AIDS," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Testing for AIDS is not routinely done by medical examiners but was done in 
this case for the protection of the people who conducted the autopsy and who 
needed to take special precautions to avoid infecting themselves, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was required because McClatchy was not under a doctor's care at the 
time of his death, which occurred while he was jogging in a local park. 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy was editor of the Sacramento Bee. The McClatchy chain also publishes

SENATE PASSES MEASURE TO BAR POSTING GUARDS AT VOTING SITES

<P>
Reacting to an incident at the polls in Santa Ana last year, the state Senate 
on Thursday approved legislation that would make it a crime to post security 
guards at voting sites without the permission of election officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco), who authored the bill, said the measure 
was meant to prevent a repeat of what he termed the "disturbing episode" that 
occurred Nov. 8, when the Orange County Republican Party hired 20 uniformed 
guards to monitor Latinos as they went to the polls in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders said the guards were retained to watch for voter fraud after 
party officials heard persistent rumors that Democrats were going to bus 
non-citizens to the polls to vote illegally. GOP officials said the guards were 
given strict instructions not to interfere with voters and were pulled from 
their posts when the registrar of voters complained that their actions might 
intimidate Latinos legally registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would make it a felony or a misdemeanor, subject to the discretion of 
a judge, to hire or serve as a uniformed security guard within 100 feet of a 
polling place without written permission from the appropriate elections 
official. The measure also would prohibit anyone other than an elections 
official from receiving a ballot from a voter or asking a voter to turn over 
his or her ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was approved on a vote of 22 to 2, one vote more than the 
majority needed for passage in the 40-member Senate. The bill was sent to the 
Assembly, where its first stop will be the Elections, Reapportionment and 
Constitutional Amendments Committee. 
</P>
<P>
That panel includes Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), on whose behalf 
the party hired the security guards.

PARDON URGED IN '36 RAPE CONVICTION OF RADIO PERFORMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) has asked Gov. 
George Deukmejian to pardon a 1930s Los Angeles radio personality who was 
imprisoned on a false accusation of rape. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti made the request for Pedro J. Gonzales, 93, of Nestor, Calif., who had 
a KMPC radio show before he was convicted of rape in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales had served six years of a 50-year sentence when his accuser recanted 
her testimony, but he was never officially pardoned.

D.A. CANCELS INQUIRY OF ALLEGED COUNCIL BRIBE STATEMENT BY LOBBYIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office dropped its review Thursday 
of a lobbyist's statement that two council members asked for contributions in 
exchange for scheduling a hearing for her clients, saying there was no evidence 
to warrant further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said he closed the review of the matter 
after the lobbyist, Ann Carlton Bose, contradicted her initial account in a 
Thursday interview with investigators, telling them that she "never viewed the 
matter as a bribe or soliciting a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
"There's not enough to warrant an investigation," Livesay said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bose nor her attorney, Charles English, could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bose's initial account, delivered in interviews last Friday with 
KNBC and The Times, she had tried unsuccessfully for four months last year to 
get a hearing before the Transportation and Traffic Committee, which Councilman 
Nate Holden chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Bose said that finally she called council President John Ferraro for help in 
persuading Holden. Ferraro called back, Bose said, and told her Holden said he 
would schedule the hearing if Bose's clients supported Ferraro's next 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbyist then wrote a letter to her clients relating the conversation. 
Publication of the letter prompted the review by the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Livesay said that in the interview with investigators, Bose contradicted her 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
"She did say that she never took Councilman Ferraro seriously," Livesay said. 
</P>
<P>
Bose told investigators that Ferraro simply reminded her that the ambulance 
companies that she represents were his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say that what she said contradicts what the letter says," Livesay 
added. "She never took Ferraro seriously when he made comments more than a year 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Bose also told investigators that the letter was a draft that was not intended 
to be mailed, but that she inadvertently failed to review it before it was sent 
out to clients. Bose did not personally sign the letter before it was sent out. 
Her signature was instead signed by a secretary, who had permission to file the 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he would talk to his lawyer, Gloria Allred, before deciding whether 
to drop a civil suit alleging libel and slander that he filed Monday against 
Bose and her employer, Devon Blaine and The Blaine Group. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, I never said it!" he said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continuing Doubts 
</P>
<P>
Holden earlier this week said he considered the allegation by Bose to be an 
"intentional" attack on his integrity. On Thursday, he indicated continuing 
doubts about the newest Bose account. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, in a statement issued by his council office, thanked the district 
attorney's office for acting "in a timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
"But the ultimate action was what I expected," he added. " I am not surprised 
because I knew all along there was no substance to the allegations. 
Unfortunately, when people make irresponsible statements of this kind, it 
tarnishes the image of all elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
Livesay said Bose was the only person interviewed by the district attorney's 
office during its review. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the only witness, as the ostensible writer of the letter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges are anticipated against Bose or others as a result of the flap, 
Livesay added. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see in the context of all these events any crime that's been 
committed," he said.

JUDGE ERRED BUT JUSTICES RULE DEATH VERDICT VALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday affirmed the death sentence of the killer 
of a Long Beach flight attendant, although the court found that the sentencing 
judge had erroneously cited a "long and distinguished" criminal record of the 
defendant, who never before had been convicted of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
The court held 5 to 2 that despite the error there were other legally 
sufficient grounds for the judge, now deceased, to uphold the jury's verdict of 
death in the case of Watson Allison, 30, convicted in the murder of Leonard 
Wesley Polk, 23, in a November, 1982, robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The majority in an opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson concluded that it was 
"self-evident" that Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Pat Mullendore had 
correctly approved the verdict based on the coldblooded nature of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"At least one of the shots (was) fired execution-style at point-blank range 
into the victim's head," Eagleson noted. 
</P>
<P>
But the court's two dissenters -- Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard 
-- said the judge either was thinking of "another case" or was improperly 
referring to evidence against Allison that was not before the jury. While the 
conviction should be upheld, the death sentence should be set aside, the two 
justices said. 
</P>
<P>
"The error was particularly egregious in this instance for the judge obviously 
did not recollect the facts," Mosk wrote. "Whether he merely failed to recall 
the evidence or actually had some other case in mind, we shall never know 
because of his death." 
</P>
<P>
Broussard said that in further proceedings another judge might decide Allison 
should be sentenced only to life in prison without parole. "This was an 
ordinary felony-murder case; certainly a serious crime, but one which sadly is 
also relatively common," he said. "Nothing in the circumstances of the crime in 
any way sets it apart as particularly aggravated." 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert S. Henry said he is "pleased with the result" of 
the decision and that the justices had correctly concluded that the judge's 
remarks were insufficiently harmful to warrant a new penalty trial. Allison's 
attorney in the appeal was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Allison and a co-defendant, Samuel Quinton Bonner, were accused of tricking 
Polk to gain entrance to the victim's apartment to steal stereo components, a 
television set and other items. Polk, an employee of Pacific Southwest 
Airlines, was found in his blood-spattered living room, dead from a severe 
beating and two gunshot wounds to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Allison admitted that the two had planned to "rip off" Polk but claimed Bonner 
had committed the murder. Bonner was tried separately, found guilty and 
sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 a Los Angeles Superior Court jury found Allison guilty, concluding he 
was the triggerman in the killing, and returned a verdict of death. Judge 
Mullendore, reviewing the verdict, said the death sentence was "proper." 
</P>
<P>
"And further, as far as the long and distinguished record of the defendant in 
the criminal annals of the county, I think that the defendant has now earned 
the verdict the jury has given him," said the judge, who then formally 
sentenced Allison to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, the justices pointed out that no evidence of violent 
criminal conduct or any prior felony convictions had been offered to the jury. 
Thus, they said, the judge's reliance on such a "record" in approving the 
sentence was improper. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said Mullendore also failed to state other specific reasons for 
upholding the verdict, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, the court said, it would send the case back for resentencing. But 
because the judge has since died -- in 1985 at age 67 -- and there is no other 
judge as familiar with the case, the justices were compelled to review the 
issue, they said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ENCEPHALITIS FOUND IN VALLEY PIGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health officials are warning residents to avoid exposure to the St. Louis 
encephalitis virus, which has been detected in pigeons in the Sepulveda Dam 
Recreation Area in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
The disease is spread to humans by mosquitoes that have ingested the blood of 
infected pigeons, Barbara Gondo of the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gondo said officials have put up signs advising visitors to the dam to wear 
long-sleeved shirts and apply insect repellent. 
</P>
<P>
The disease, which causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, can cause 
fever, headaches and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are advising residents to check pots, jars, old tires and other 
sources of stagnant water that might be mosquito-breeding areas. Also, ponds, 
swimming pools and sprinklers should be properly maintained, Gondo said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOG SHOT IN STANDOFF EXPECTED TO RECOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bullet remained lodged in Asko the Long Beach police dog's jawbone Thursday, 
a day after he was shot in the snout during a standoff between police and a 
barricaded woman, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Asko, a 4-year-old, male German shepherd who has worked for the Long Beach 
Police Department for the last two years, was wounded during the 11-hour 
stalemate that ended with the shooting early Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Asko lost 1 1/2 pints of blood and two upper molars, said Long Beach Police 
Sgt. Chuck Higley, the department's canine handler. 
</P>
<P>
He said Asko was in stable condition and was expected to recover fully even 
though the "bullet, when it shattered, lodged on the inner part of his 
jawbone." 
</P>
<P>
The woman involved in the shoot-out, identified as Kari Lynne Kantonwine, was 
treated at County-USC Medical Center for a broken arm and booked for 
investigation of shooting a police dog and four other counts, said Police Lt. 
Stephen Bonswor.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ONE OF MOST-WANTED SUSPECTS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the city's 12 most-wanted bank robbers was arrested Thursday, one day 
after the Los Angeles Police Department released a list of the suspected 
felons. 
</P>
<P>
Archie Michael Wolf, 35, also known as "Red Eye" because of a red spot between 
his left eye and nose, was arrested at 12:15 p.m. at his Sylmar apartment at 
14040 Foothill Road, detective Joe Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf is believed to be responsible for 17 bank robberies in Los Angeles and 10 
others in the county, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got lots of calls from people after we released the 12 most-wanted list," 
Chandler said. "One citizen who saw Wolf's picture on a TV news broadcast was 
able to tell us where he lived."

Gang members who were apparently retaliating for an earlier shooting at a 
Willowbrook house drove by the same house and opened fire with a shotgun, 
killing a man outside, sheriff's deputies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Perales, 23, was in the driveway of the house when he was shot in the 
chest by one of a barrage of shots fired from a passing car about 8 p.m. 
Wednesday, Sheriff's homicide Lt. Dan Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
The house, at Piru Street and Willowbrook Avenue, is a known hangout for gang 
members, but it was not immediately determined if Perales was affiliated with a 
gang, Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he apparently died as a result of gang rivalries that had triggered a 
shooting at the same house Tuesday night. In that shooting, someone in the 
house had fired at a passing car, Burt said.

OFFICER KILLS SUSPECT IN 'ASIANS ROBBING ASIANS' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Monterey Park police officer fatally shot one of four suspects after they 
fled late Wednesday from a house where an 11-year-old boy and his 16-year-old 
sister were held at gunpoint while their residence was being ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
Before being discovered by the intruders -- who police described as part of a 
growing number of Vietnamese preying upon others of Vietnamese descent -- the 
girl had used a portable phone to call the 911 emergency number. 
</P>
<P>
The case, Monterey Park police said, draws attention to Asian immigrants 
victimizing others of Asian ancestry who, for cultural reasons, sometimes 
mistrust police and fear calling authorities for help. 
</P>
<P>
The victims and suspects all are Vietnamese who had arrived in the United 
States within the past few years, police said, as was the dead man, a 
19-year-old from Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Joseph Santoro termed the case a victory in the department's 
continuing campaign to encourage Monterey Park residents, many of them new 
immigrants from Asia, to call police for help. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our biggest challenges is to get (new Asian immigrants) to understand 
that police are here to protect them," Santoro said. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Asian) people come to this country, they bring a whole mystique about 
crime in their native country," Santoro said. "They fear the criminal element. 
And they have an equal suspicion of police. . . . Police are perceived as 
corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, within three minutes of getting the 911 call at 10:59 p.m., 
patrol cars arrived at the house on Keller Street. One suspect dived through a 
window to escape and three others followed. The brother and sister ran to 
safety out the front door. 
</P>
<P>
Police chased three of the suspects for several blocks. A Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department helicopter, using a special infrared detection device, 
tracked them to a brushy hillside above the back yards of a residential 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
An officer killed one suspect with two shotgun blasts, police said, after the 
man disobeyed orders to freeze, moving abruptly as if to fire a gun. Nearby, 
police found a revolver that the suspects allegedly had used. 
</P>
<P>
Police captured a 14-year-old boy and a 19-year-old Los Angeles man, Ly De Nhi, 
and booked them on suspicion of murder and robbery, police said. A fourth 
suspect was still at large. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was injured. Police withheld the dead man's identity pending 
notification of relatives. Police also would not release the name of the 
officer who shot the man, saying that the investigation of the killing is 
continuing. Santoro called the death unfortunate but said the shooting was 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
The two arrested suspects, police said, both are ethnic Chinese originally from 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnamese criminals tend to victimize their own people. This is a clear 
example," Santoro said. "They think they can intimidate Vietnamese easier than 
non-Vietnamese." 
</P>
<P>
Social service agencies, as well as police in the San Gabriel Valley, Santoro 
said, often encounter new Asian immigrants who express hesitancy to report 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
To bridge cultural gaps in Monterey Park, Santoro said, the city has made 
efforts to hire police who speak different Asian languages. Twenty percent of 
the city's police officers are of Asian ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's case, the 16-year-old girl did not hesitate to call police as 
soon as she heard the sound of a bedroom window being broken. "Both of these 
children were very courageous," Santoro said.

Delivering a slap at City Councilwoman Joy Picus -- and a stunning blow to 
Woodland Hills homeowners -- Los Angeles planning commissioners Thursday 
approved construction of a controversial $150-million high-rise project next to 
a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members voted 3 to 2 to allow development of the nine-building 
Warner Ridge office complex at the northeast corner of De Soto Avenue and 
Oxnard Street. They rejected pleas by Picus and nearby residents that 
single-family homes be built on the ridge instead. 
</P>
<P>
Planners praised the 22 1/2-acre proposal as "a quality development" that has 
built-in safeguards to keep it from causing traffic jams in the adjoining 
Warner Center area in the western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents who have spent 30 months fighting the development warned it will 
bring gridlock to nearby streets. They complained that the high-rises will 
extend Warner Center's urbanization for the first time beyond its boundaries 
and into a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picus Angered 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry, outraged, appalled by what they did," Picus said after the 
commission vote. "This is a very pro-development commission appointed by the 
mayor. It reflects his pro-development bias." 
</P>
<P>
Picus vowed to try to overturn the commission action at the City Council -- 
although she acknowledged that it may be difficult to win the eight council 
votes necessary to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a chore. I will really have to work at it. It won't be 
easy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Councilman Hal Bernson, head of the council's influential Planning and 
Environment Committee, has already "dropped hints" that he supports the Warner 
Ridge proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just horrified at the commission allowing an intrusion of Warner Center 
into a single-family neighborhood," she said. "This was a quality-of-life issue 
that was ignored by the majority of the commission." 
</P>
<P>
Dejected leaders of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization said they will 
continue their opposition when the project's zone change and General Plan 
amendment come before the council for review. But they wavered on an earlier 
pledge to fight the project in court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We need eight votes, and we know we have one for sure," Robert Gross, a vice 
president of the group, said in reference to Picus' planned council fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuit Lost 
</P>
<P>
But Gross would not speculate about whether his organization would file a 
lawsuit to block the high-rises. Last week, the group lost a suit that it had 
filed to prevent development of surplus Pierce College land. This week, the 
homeowners were asked to pay $58,000 in attorney's fees that the developer 
spent in fighting their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Ridge developer Jack Spound said he is confident that changes made 
during the last two years to his construction plans will protect the adjacent 
neighborhood of 30-year-old homes. 
</P>
<P>
He said the changes were made at the request of nearby residents, some of whom 
withdrew their opposition and became supporters of the project during the 2 1/2 
years of debate. "We hope the City Council complies with its commission's 
recommendation," said Spound, who is in partnership with the Johnson Wax 
Development Corp. for the project. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the Warner Ridge commercial complex would consist of three 
seven-story buildings, two five-story structures, one four-story building, one 
three-story building, a one-story restaurant and a parking structure that would 
be partially built into the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings would be positioned so that the ridge screens them from the view 
of residents of the nearby Carlton Terrace residential neighborhood. Dirt 
excavated from the site would be piled into a berm along the northeastern edge 
of the site to similarly shield next-door Pierce College from the offices. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's commission approval was welcomed by college officials. Although they 
were told last month by the Los Angeles Community College District to stay 
neutral in the dispute, school officials made it clear that they oppose 
construction of homes on Warner Ridge because of the potential for homeowner 
complaints about flies and odors from the campus farm. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Suzette Neiman and William R. Christopher voted against the 
high-rises. Neiman said she believes the project would destroy the integrity of 
the city's effort to cluster tall buildings in the middle of Warner Center. 
Christopher indicated that he thought the project was too big. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioners Theodore Stein Jr. and Fernando Torres-Gil and panel 
President William G. Luddy praised the Warner Ridge plan. They rejected a 
suggestion by city planning staff members that the project's proposed 810,000 
square feet of floor space be reduced to 541,700 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is a quality development," Stein said. "If all projects on 
Ventura Boulevard had its quality, the dissension we see there week by week 
wouldn't be there."

MANSION MOVES OUT AHEAD OF WRECKER'S BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It became official Thursday afternoon. Los Angeles Historic Landmark No. 167 
was saved from the wrecker's ball. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 11 months of frantic efforts, the once-stately Edward Strong 
mansion, a reminder of downtown Los Angeles' Victorian past, was towed away 
from its site of 102 years on West 15th Street, where it stood in the way of a 
$390-million expansion of the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The slow move to the mansion's new site, near MacArthur Park, was to be 
completed by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great!" said preservationist Jay Rounds as the blue-and-white 
three-story structure creaked past him. "Now it's time to go back to work and 
save another building." 
</P>
<P>
Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, was among those who 
gushed and fussed over the Strong mansion's relocation during ceremonies 
presided over by Mayor Tom Bradley. Barbara Kaiser, manager of the Convention 
Center expansion project, motioned excitedly to friends to snap a picture of 
her as the structure moved past. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" she asked. "This building got saved." 
</P>
<P>
Excitement over the mansion, however, wasn't always there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Takers 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kaiser and other officials of the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency could find no takers for the residence, which was declared 
a landmark in 1976 because of its unique Queen Anne architecture in the 
Caribbean style. It was one of two major Victorian structures remaining in the 
downtown area. (The other is in Angelino Heights.) 
</P>
<P>
It could not stay where it was because of the expansion work. And the expense 
of moving and renovating the deteriorating building -- ranging up to $1.4 
million -- discouraged potential buyers, Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
With demolition less than 30 days away, The Times reported on the concerns over 
the mansion's fate. Shortly thereafter, the mayor's office formed a committee 
to save the home, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA agreed to provide a $500,000 low-interest loan to move and rehabilitate 
the mansion -- named for salesman Edward Strong, who moved into the house in 
1887 -- and the Department of Water and Power offered a new site in the 800 
block of South Coronado Street, near MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows what can happen when various agencies work together," Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion, after refurbishing is completed next spring, will be converted 
into a small six-unit apartment house for low-income families. It will be 
operated by the L.A. Family Housing Corp., a private, nonprofit group that 
operates nearly 250 low-income housing units in Los Angeles.

DWP'S $1,013 CELEBRATION STRIKES SOUR NOTE WITH CITY CONTROLLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Bednarski, a planner for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
remembers the main dish as "some kind of fish or something." Secretary Jane 
Funn says, "I think it was steak." Engineering manager Gary Stolarik also could 
not recall the fare -- "but I think I ate everything -- I usually do." 
</P>
<P>
While the food at the catered luncheon on March 6 for 25 city employees may 
have been less than memorable, the $1,013 bill, according to city Controller 
Rick Tuttle, was "outrageous." And so, Tuttle added, was the venue -- the 
exclusive Jonathan Club, which has been sued by the city for allegedly 
discriminating against women. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what they ate," Tuttle said, "but I know this: It was too much." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payment Blocked 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Tuttle blocked reimbursement of a $40-a-person tab submitted by a 
DWP executive for what was dubbed a "celebration" of an out-of-court settlement 
of a lawsuit filed against the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
"Rate-payers have a right to expect that the rates they pay are for water and 
electricity service, not for employees to feast on $40 lunches," Tuttle wrote 
in a letter to Norman E. Nichols, DWP general manager. " . . . In addition, it 
is absolutely unbelievable that DWP requested reimbursement for this event, 
when it was clearly indicated on the bill that the party took place at the 
Jonathan Club." 
</P>
<P>
After a quick review, Nichols announced late Thursday that, while the 
celebratory lunch was "appropriate," the price and location of the meal were 
not, and added that the three host managers will split the check. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a tart letter to Tuttle, Nichols added: "I was surprised to learn of 
your concern through your press announcement. In the future, these oversights 
will receive my attention if you will be so kind as to simply call me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorneys Asked to Pay 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for City Atty. James K. Hahn, whose office is handling 
the Jonathan Club legal battle, announced that three deputy city attorneys 
assigned to the lawsuit who attended the DWP luncheon have been asked to pay 
their portion of the bill "out of their own pockets." 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon, organized by Walter Hoye, DWP engineer of design, was arranged 
after a $2-million settlement of a $13-million lawsuit filed by the M. A. 
Mortenson Co., general contractors for a $146-million water filtration plant in 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"The luncheon meeting was to thank all the DWP people, all the clerks and 
secretaries and aides and engineers and lawyers who worked so hard to have a 
very successful conclusion of the litigation," Hoye said Thursday. "We had very 
short notice to try to find a place to have this luncheon meeting; we didn't 
know we would settle rather than go to trial. . . . Given this set of 
circumstances, it seemed reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle, however, vehemently disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, he acknowledged that the city Charter places no 
specific limits on meal expenses, and added that he would be hard-pressed to 
define any. Still, he asserted, there are common sense guidelines.

INJURED TEACHER PAINED BY SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "She's an excellent teacher, the best. We've learned so much from her." -- 
Hana Ogawa, Palos Verdes High School Art Club co-president. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the best teacher I have ever had." -- Tisha Treherne, Palos Verdes 
High School art student. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has consistently been an excellent teacher with high standards and has 
the respect and admiration of all her students and colleagues." -- Beth Glavas 
and Sara Hackenberg, Advanced Placement art students at Palos Verdes High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
These accolades for 57-year-old Chizuko de Queiroz, a teacher for 27 years in 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, sound as if they might have 
been delivered at a testimonial or her retirement dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the words are from a petition, signed by more than 200 students, 
asking the district to give de Queiroz back her job. More than 70 faculty 
members have signed a separate petition protesting "the callous way Mrs. de 
Queiroz was removed from the classroom" and praising her "outstanding" 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz, who has been chairman of the art department at Palos Verdes High 
School since 1980, said she was told at a meeting with district officials on 
March 31 that she could not continue in her $43,000-a-year job because of a 
shoulder and back injury she suffered on the job in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided to Fight 
</P>
<P>
At first she tried quietly to get her job back, but when that met with no 
success she decided to fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I realized it doesn't work to just sit back and meditate and hope 
everything will work out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real blow when they said I couldn't return to work because of this 
1983 injury," de Queiroz said, pacing nervously as she talked to a reporter at 
her Palos Verdes Estates home earlier this week. "If they had done this back 
then, maybe I could have accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
District officials have declined to comment on the case, saying that it is the 
district's policy not to publicly discuss personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said that when she showed up at the March 31 meeting, she was given 
a copy of a letter -- which would arrive at her home later that day -- from the 
district's insurance carrier stating that continuing to teach "places you in 
danger of seriously reinjuring yourself." 
</P>
<P>
She said the administrators gave her three choices: training for a non-teaching 
job, early retirement or disability retirement. De Queiroz said that when she 
objected, Assistant Supt. David Capelouto and Personnel Director George 
Hardesty mentioned a fourth possibility: dismissal. She is scheduled to meet 
with district officials Monday to further discuss her options. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Jeff Younggren, president of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Unified School District Board of Education, said that generally in 
worker's compensation cases, the school district has to abide by the advice of 
its insurance carrier. Noting he could not discuss the details of her case, he 
added, "It is not that the district is unfeeling or insensitive . . . but we 
can't afford to lose our coverage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hired Attorney 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said that after several weeks of unsuccessfully trying to persuade 
district officials to let her go back to school, she hired an attorney and 
started lobbying members of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize how difficult it would be to have to stay home at this time 
in the school year," she said, brushing aside a tear. "I have been frenzied to 
think I couldn't be with my students at this most important point, as they go 
into their Advanced Placement exam." De Queiroz said that for the last two or 
three years, she has been working closely with about 30 students who will earn 
10 units of college credit if they pass their Advanced Placement examination 
next Thursday. With the examination fast approaching, "they needed me," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The March 27, 1989, letter to de Queiroz from the insurance carrier -- 
Tustin-based Greenfield-Thompson Associates -- stated that a medical 
examination by Dr. Ray Craemer "indicates that you may not be able to return to 
your usual employment because of your 4/28/83 job injury." 
</P>
<P>
The letter states that "Your job duties exceed your medical restrictions, and 
returning to these duties places you in danger of reinjuring yourself." Tom 
Blake, claims manager for Greenfield-Thompson, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Checkups 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said that Craemer had checked her annually since 1983 and certified 
her for work every year until now. 
</P>
<P>
She said she sees no reason why he should change his opinion. She has submitted 
to the district letters from her physicians, John E. Stratton and Luis A. Chui, 
stating that she is able to work as long as she avoids heavy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she can continue her work as a teacher as she has done the past 
years with job restrictions, specifically no lifting over 15 pounds and no 
repetitive bending, stooping or lifting of any type," Stratton said in an April 
19 letter to Hardesty. 
</P>
<P>
Chui said in an April 24 letter to Hardesty: "I see no medical or neurological 
contraindications for her to continue her job as an art teacher." 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz's 1983 injury occurred when she lifted some lightweight materials 
for an art project at school. Within a few days, she returned to work, treating 
her condition with regular physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she won a $25,800 worker's compensation award, which she receives in 
$130-a-week increments. She said she uses the money to hire household help on 
tasks she can no longer perform because of her injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occasional Relapses 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said that at work and at home, she has been careful to avoid 
movements that would exacerbate her injury, but occasionally she suffers 
relapses and has to take brief periods off from work. She has been paid by 
worker's compensation during those absences. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, she said, she was out of work 10 or 12 days due to her 
shoulder, with the most recent absence of seven days in January. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials blame the after-effects of her injury, de Queiroz said she 
wonders whether her suspension may have been prompted by a lengthy dispute she 
had this year over the district purchasing her art supply order at retail 
rather than wholesale prices as she had recommended. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of principle, she said, she criticized officials for exceeding her 
department budget by $500. Finally, the funds were restored to the department 
March 27, she said, but it was a short-lived victory. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, de Queiroz said, she was removed from her job. Until then, she 
said, she had no inkling she was to be relieved of her duties. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, de Queiroz has scored numerous accomplishments, and her 
scrapbook includes several clippings from the school newspaper detailing awards 
to her and her students. She was a finalist in the district's Teacher of the 
Year contest in 1984, and was nominated by the school administration in 1985 
for the Bravo Award for excellence in fine arts. In 1984, 1986 and 1987 her 
students had winning entries in the U.S. Congressional District Art Contest. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a very gifted teacher," said Lauren Sanders, executive director of the 
Palos Verdes Faculty Assn., the union representing district teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter demanding de Queiroz's immediate reinstatement, Sanders said that 
to suspend or dismiss de Queiroz the district would have to follow specific 
procedures in the state Education Code. "This has not been done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, should the district consider de Queiroz disabled, federal 
and state rehabilitation laws "expressly prohibit the denial of employment 
because of a handicap." 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said that all she wants to do is to return to her students. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize how much I would miss them," she said.

WRONG MAN ARRESTED TWICE FOR SAME CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
INGLEWOOD MECHANIC SUES FOR LATEST JAILING ON CHICAGO RESIDENTIAL BURGLARY 
WARRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago: The City of Big Shoulders. And to Roberto Perales Hernandez, the City 
of Big Trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Perales, 31, an unemployed auto mechanic from Inglewood, said that twice in the 
last three years he has been picked up by police and held in Los Angeles County 
Jail as a suspect in a 1985 Chicago residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"They said I had a warrant in Chicago," Perales said this week. "I said, 'I've 
never been to Chicago. How could I have a warrant there!' " 
</P>
<P>
The answer, Perales says, is that authorities have confused him with another 
Roberto Hernandez. Perales commonly writes his name in the Spanish style, with 
his mother's maiden name last -- Roberto Perales Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Perales has filed a lawsuit in Torrance Superior Court, charging the Hawthorne 
Police Department, Los Angeles County and the state with false imprisonment, 
infliction of emotional distress and civil rights violations stemming from the 
most recent arrest last year. 
</P>
<P>
Perales had previously received a $7,000 settlement from the county, which held 
him for 12 days in 1986 on the Chicago warrant before realizing he was the 
wrong man, said his attorney, Raul Lomas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the county, the city of Hawthorne and the state said they will 
not comment on either arrest as long as Perales' new lawsuit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion centers on a single entry in a computer database that provides 
police throughout the country with information on crime and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The National Crime Information Center computer lists a Roberto Hernandez as 
wanted by the Cook County, Ill., Sheriff's Department for a 1985 residential 
burglary. The wanted man is described as 5 feet, 8 inches, 160 pounds with 
brown hair and brown eyes and a tattoo on his left arm. He was born on Feb. 2, 
1958. No middle name is listed. 
</P>
<P>
Perales describes himself as 5 feet, 8 inches, 140 pounds with brown hair and 
brown eyes and tattoos on his left arm and hand. He, too, was born on Feb. 2, 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
To add to the confusion, Perales reports a Social Security number that differs 
by only one digit from the one listed for the wanted man. 
</P>
<P>
Perales said he first became aware of the Chicago warrant on Feb. 24, 1986, 
when Inglewood police arrested him for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
The Tijuana, Mexico, native said he was held for 12 days at Los Angeles County 
Jail on the warrant, despite the fact that he was not sentenced to jail for his 
first drunk driving offense. He was subsequently placed on probation and had 
his license suspended for three months. 
</P>
<P>
After reaching the $7,000 out-of-court settlement with the county in that case, 
Perales said, "I thought everything was OK in their computer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopped on Way to Work 
</P>
<P>
But on March 15, 1988, Perales said, he was pulled over by Hawthorne police 
officers as he drove to work. Perales said the officers stopped him because his 
car registration stickers had expired, but checked their computer and found two 
outstanding warrants -- one for an unpaid ticket for not wearing a safety belt 
and the other for the Chicago burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I can't believe this. I'm going back to County Jail!' " Perales said. 
"I told them, 'I've been through this once before and they found out it wasn't 
me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Court documents show that Inglewood Municipal Court Commissioner Wesley A. 
Russell ordered Perales released from jail the day after his arrest, saying 
that a night in County Jail was sufficient penalty for not paying the seat belt 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
But sheriff's deputies cited the Chicago warrant and said they would not let 
him go, Perales said. When he told deputies that they had the wrong man, 
Perales said they responded, "That's what they all say." 
</P>
<P>
Perales said he feared he would lose his job and that his wife suffered severe 
anxiety, because the couple is still in the process of applying to be legalized 
under the amnesty program.

He was held for seven days before deputies awoke him early in the morning and 
told him he was free, Perales said. The jailers offered no explanation, but 
Perales said he assumed that authorities realized they had the wrong man when 
fingerprints arrived from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials won't say why Perales was released, or even if he 
was jailed in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Lomas said he hopes to obtain a court order for Perales to give to 
officers, stating that he is not the man wanted on the Chicago warrant. 
</P>
<P>
That might be a good idea. The Cook County Sheriff's Department and the 
National Crime Information Center computer still listed Roberto Hernandez as a 
wanted man last week.

'DANGEROUS' BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI is searching Southern California for a bank robbery suspect, described 
as armed and extremely dangerous, who is believed to be responsible for four 
holdups in Torrance, Orange County and Florida during the past year that netted 
nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Stephen Gambin, 41, is believed to be traveling with another fugitive, 
Julieta Flores Marquez, 46, who is wanted by the FBI and the U.S. Marshal's 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attempted Robbery at Mall 
</P>
<P>
Gambin is also a suspect in the attempted robbery last Friday of a Security 
Pacific Bank branch at the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, according to 
Lawrence G. Lawler, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
In that incident, a man believed to be Gambin pulled a gun on the bank manager 
in one of the shopping center's parking garages, handcuffed a briefcase to her 
wrist and warned her that it would explode if she did not return with cash 
within 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
When the manager entered the bank, employees called police, who removed the 
handcuffs a short time later. No bomb was found in the briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
When police went to the garage to search for the suspect, the manager's car was 
missing. It was found abandoned a short distance away. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI believes Gambin also was involved in last August's robbery of a 
Security Pacific Bank branch in Buena Park and the holdup of a Wells Fargo Bank 
branch in Torrance in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the Buena Park case, two men held a Security Pacific Bank teller and her 
family hostage overnight in their La Habra apartment. A device they claimed was 
a bomb was strapped to the teller's body and she was driven to the bank, where 
one of the robbers told employees the device would be detonated if they didn't 
open the vault. They escaped with $80,000. The device was not a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
In the Wells Fargo robbery, three men held a bank manager and her son hostage 
for 12 hours and then drove to the bank and forced employees to open the vault. 
Officials said at the time that "a large sum" was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Gambin is also wanted for two Florida bank robberies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fugitives List 
</P>
<P>
In all cases, the FBI said, Gambin used handguns, disguises, handcuffs and bomb 
threats, and either took or threatened to take hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Gambin was convicted and served time in federal prison for a 1973 bank robbery 
in Iowa in which hostages were taken. During an escape attempt in 1976, he shot 
and wounded two U.S. Marshals. He is wanted for parole violation and is on the 
marshal's "Top 15 Fugitives List." 
</P>
<P>
Marquez, a disbarred San Antonio attorney, is charged with harboring, aiding 
and abetting Gambin and is also wanted for unlawful flight to avoid 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a couple of nogoodniks, robbing banks and scaring the heck out of 
people," Lawler said. 
</P>
<P>
Gambin is described as white, 5 feet 9 inches tall, 185 pounds with a muscular 
build, brown eyes, brown and gray hair, and a ruddy complexion. 
</P>
<P>
Marquez is a Latina, 5 feet 6 inches tall, 120 pounds, with brown hair and 
eyes, although her appearance has been altered by plastic surgery, the FBI 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about their whereabouts should contact the FBI at (213) 
477-6565 or the U.S. Marshal's Service at (213) 894-2485.

WEEKENDER: 'THE ONLY PARADE LAWNDALE HAS . . . IS PUTTING OUR YOUTH ON DISPLAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block is returning this weekend to where he 
began his law enforcement career more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Block will be grand marshal of the 1989 edition of the Lawndale 
Youth Parade, the big parade that Lawndale has been putting on for 30 years to 
salute its young people. 
</P>
<P>
Officials invited Block because of his ties to the area. "He came here in 1956 
as a brand-new deputy in the Lennox station," which serves Lawndale, said 
Shirley Rudolph, chairman of this year's parade. "I called him up, told him we 
wanted him as grand marshal, and he said: 'I'm yours for the day.' " 
</P>
<P>
The parade will step off at 10 a.m. from the intersection of Manhattan Beach 
and Hawthorne boulevards and travel north on Hawthorne. About 1,450 youngsters 
and adults are expected to march or ride horses and vintage convertibles. More 
than a thousand people will line the route. (The parade will be on the west 
side of the divided boulevard. The east side will be open to two-way traffic, 
according to the city.) 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only parade Lawndale has, and it is putting our youth on display," 
said Rudolph, who is also chairman of the city Parks, Recreation and Social 
Services Commission. 
</P>
<P>
This year's parade will have an added twist as the first event of Lawndale's 
30th anniversary celebration. The old agricultural community -- where crops, 
sheep and chickens once shared the landscape with people -- grew up after World 
War II, incorporating as a city on Dec. 28, 1959. 
</P>
<P>
The parade lineup will include several Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops, bands 
and drill teams from Hawthorne and Leuzinger high schools, players and coaches 
from 35 Little League teams and the Torrance Mounted Posse. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the color will be clowns, fire and police vehicles (including some 
antiques) and a float depicting a battleship, courtesy of the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Dignitaries will include Lawndale City Council members, state Sen. Diane Watson 
(D-Los Angeles), and three South Bay "misses" -- Wendy Berry, who is Miss 
Centinela Valley; Anna Marasella, who is Miss Hawthorne, and Valencia Bilyeau, 
who is Miss Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Two distinguished Lawndale children will join Sheriff Block as honorary grand 
marshals. They are Marisol Garcia, 8, this year's Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
poster child, and Danny Kramer, 4, a skateboarding whiz who has appeared on 
television in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Other honorary grand marshals are Sheriff's Sgt. Aaron Williams and Deputy 
Warren Asmus, who teach safety and drug and gang awareness. A ventriloquist, 
Williams works with his pal, Deputy Freddie, a puppet. 
</P>
<P>
After the parade, a community hot-dog picnic will start at noon at the Civic 
Center. The event will include entertainment and presentation of awards for 
outstanding performances and appearances in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
For its 30th birthday bash, Lawndale has lined up several other events, 
including a fall youth walk-a-thon to raise money for community organizations, 
display of historical memorabilia at the Fun Fair on Sept. 24 at the Civic 
Center, and a 5- and 10-K run in October. 
</P>
<P>
On the actual birthday, Dec. 28, an open house is scheduled at City Hall. The 
next evening, a community dinner will be held at the Alondra Park Golf Course 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph said 10 volunteers are working to put on the parade and the picnic, 
which are financed by the city and the Lawndale Businesspersons Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"This parade has been going on for so many years that people just turn out for 
it automatically," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, they turned out despite hail, rain and thunder, Rudolph said. That 
prompted the committee to move the parade this year from its traditional April 
date to May. 
</P>
<P>
Added Rudolph: "Those rain forecasts this week had us worried." Gerald Faris

Comedian Eddie Murphy has been sued for $75 million by actress Michael Michele 
Williams, 22, who alleges that Murphy had her fired from his film "Harlem 
Nights" because she spurned his advances. Williams, who performs under the name 
Michael Michele, also sued Paramount Pictures over her dismissal. Williams 
claims in her New York suit that she was removed from the proposed TV version 
of Murphy's "Coming to America" so she could appear opposite him in "Harlem 
Nights." Williams' lawsuit claims Murphy "made consistent, personal overtures" 
that she "did not desire" and alleges that Murphy had her fired "when it became 
clear" that she "would not accede to his sexual demands." SHAUNA SNOW and

Producer Elliot Kastner is seeking $6 million from Al Pacino, claiming the 
actor reneged on an agreement to star in the film "Carlito's Way." The lawsuit, 
filed in Los Angeles federal court, claims Pacino worked hand-in-hand with 
Kastner and co-plaintiff Cinema Corp. of America for more than a year in 
writing the screenplay, selecting co-stars and rehearsing. "Nonetheless, at the 
11th hour, Pacino announced he did not intend to fulfill his promises," says 
the breach-of-contract and bad faith complaint, which seeks $1 million in 
actual costs spent on the aborted project and $5 million in punitive damages.

A state Senate subcommittee voted Thursday to restore a $3-million cut proposed 
by Gov. George Deukmejian for the $15.6-million budget of the California Arts 
Council and to give $2.2 million more to the arts agency. An Assembly 
subcommittee is scheduled to vote on the matter on May 24. It has already 
postponed a vote in order to study the council's administrative budget, which 
some of its members believe should be dramatically reduced, a source who wished 
to remain anonymous said. SHAUNA SNOW and ALEENE MacMINN

Two former Tampa, Fla., TV news managers have been charged with illegally 
tapping into phone lines and computers at another station to gain a news edge 
over their competitors. Former news director Terry Cole and assistant news 
director Michael Shapiro at WTSP-TV have been charged with 17 counts of 
computer hacking and conspiracy in the theft of information from WTVT-TV 
through computer phone lines, authorities said. Their arraignment is set for 
May 19. If convicted, each could face a maximum prison sentence of 85 years. 
The two were fired from WTSP when the station learned of the alleged thefts. 
The break-ins began in November but were not noticed until Jan. 12, when WTVT's 
morning news producer noticed that files were missing, authorities said. 
Computer experts determined that an intruder had rifled the files. Authorities 
said Shapiro knew WTVT's security system thoroughly because he had helped set 
it up while working there as an assignment manager before being hired away from 
WTVT in October.

READING BETWEEN THE LINES OF 'LA LECTRICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Reading is fine," says the police inspector in "La Lectrice" (the Music Hall), 
"but look where it leads." In Michel Deville's arch and exhaustingly clever 
film it leads a reader-for-hire, the exquisitely droll Miou-Miou, into playing 
teacher, parent, sex-therapist and revolutionary, all at a reader's wages. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the passions that reading can unleash, "La Lectrice" (The Reader) 
is without a trace of any passion, especially one for movie making. A series of 
boxes within boxes, stories within stories, it begins in bed, as Constance 
(Miou-Miou) begins reading a novel to her work-obsessed lover Jean (Christian 
Ruche). But lest anyone become aroused by that setting, Deville makes the high, 
intellectual level of his intentions stultifyingly clear from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The novel she reads is Raymond Jean's "La Lectrice," the story of Marie, who, 
like Constance, lives in Arles and decides one day to capitalize on her passion 
for literature by hiring herself out as a professional reader. As she begins, 
Constance becomes Marie, who goes about the depopulated city streets with a 
springy walk, wearing a series of perky, multicolored knit hats, perhaps to 
underline her playful nature. 
</P>
<P>
Her first client is 14-year-old Eric, in a wheelchair as he recovers from a 
serious accident. He wants the poetry of Baudelaire, the stories of De 
Maupassant. When he also gets the inch of thigh showing between Marie's black 
cotton stockings and her skirt, the erotic intensity of the moment propels Eric 
into a seizure. It does not, however, end things between Marie and Eric or even 
between Marie and Eric's mother, who knits her a bed jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Next is the nearly blind widow of a Hungarian general who gets a "marvelous 
text on precious metals" by Karl Marx, among other political subjects. (She's 
played by Maria Casares, that great icon from Cocteau's "Orpheus.") Later, it's 
a flustered and sexually stunted businessman, whom the eternally obliging Marie 
obliges with a bit of Marguerite Duras' "The Lover," never losing her place 
even when seated atop her client in her underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Deville, who a few years ago gave us the suffocatingly precious "Peril," a 
mystery-romance in which the actress Anemone affected a cane and a mock limp as 
a sort of frisson, outdoes himself here with his whimsies. "La Lectrice" (rated 
R for sexual situations and texts) is a movie that almost hugs itself with 
self-congratulation at its literacy. Mostly, that comes from elaborate film and 
literary references. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Bella, the widow's maid, who believes that spiders are attacking her, is a 
reference to Jorge Luis Borges and Manuel Puig: Borges because his story "Theme 
of the Traitor and the Hero" was the basis for Bertolucci's "The Spider's 
Strategem"; Puig for "The Kiss of the Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Lose anyone yet? It's possible that the average or even the superior moviegoer 
might not catch this cunning insider tidbit. Reviewers have it a little easier; 
it's laid out for us in the press kit. Some of the rest of the jokes are 
simpler, like the results when Marie reads "Alice in Wonderland" to the 
precocious 6-year-old Coralie. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with "La Lectrice" is that it's an entire film based on conceits 
like this, and, amusing as a few of them are, not long into the film they begin 
to pall. Then there is the distaste factor, whose very existence might astound 
the French. Presumably, we are men and women of the world, so why should the 
sight of a lovely young woman obediently giving each client exactly what he 
needs, sex, a groping feel, a look at her seminaked body -- because he has 
employed her as a reader -- strike us as soulless, even outrageous, rather than 
a comment on Marie's sweet earnestness? Perhaps because watching impersonal sex 
is entirely different from reading about it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, isn't Deville working against himself? Reading should inspire, seize, 
arouse its audience, especially the person reading. Where's the fun in the 
passionless reader? Not in "La Lectrice," you can be sure.

AKIYOSHI AND TRIO AT VINE ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years have flown by since Toshiko Akiyoshi returned to New York, ending 
the decade-long Southland residency that had brought her to poll-winning 
eminence as composer, arranger and band leader. Now heard all too rarely with 
an orchestra, she opened Wednesday at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill leading a 
trio. 
</P>
<P>
More correctly, she opened solo, since her drummer had not arrived. This 
enabled her to remind us of the unaccompanied power and drama she can bring to 
"The Village," a 5/4 composition she has been playing for 25 years. Duke 
Ellington's "Come Sunday" offered her a chance to enrich the song's already 
opulent harmonic nature. 
</P>
<P>
With Eddie Marshall now manning the drums and Ned Mann on bass, pianist 
Akiyoshi embarked on a series of pieces the three have obviously played often 
together. A bopish tune at odds with its romantic title, "I Know Who Loves 
You," reflected the perennial Bud Powell image that has been part of her 
persona ever since she was a teen-ager in Japan studying the bop pioneer's 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"American Ballad" was a handsome revision of a song written for Britt Woodman, 
who played trombone in her West Coast band. Woodman being an Ellington alumnus, 
Akiyoshi tailored this piece along Duke-ish lines. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is anything but a funk pianist, Akiyoshi invested Dizzie 
Gillespie's "Con Alma" with strong, soulful rhythmic insights. Finally there 
was another trio version of an early orchestral number, the piquant "Notorious 
Tourist From East." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall and Mann were consistently supportive as this unique jazz pioneer 
belied her bashful personality with an hour of creative, innovative mainstream 
sounds. She closes Saturday. LEONARD FEATHER

PRYOR, WILDER TEAM UP FOR MORE FUNNY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"See No Evil, Hear No Evil" (citywide) is an apt title for this brisk, 
ingenious and funny comedy that happily reunites Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. 
Pryor's Wally is blind, and he is as proudly stubborn about acknowledging his 
disability as Wilder's Dave is about admitting that he is totally deaf. They 
skirmish mightily upon meeting each other, but Dave recognizes enough of 
himself in Wally to hire him as an assistant at his Manhattan lobby newsstand. 
</P>
<P>
Wally doesn't even have a chance to start work before he and his new boss are 
swept up in non-stop adventure. 
</P>
<P>
A spectacular brunette (Joan Severance) coolly leaves a bullet-riddled corpse 
in front of the newsstand. Wally and Dave are the prime suspects. Director 
Arthur Hiller, who first teamed the duo in the 1976 "Silver Streak," and a raft 
of writers (Wilder among them) not only never let up with a steady stream of 
comic catastrophes but also manage to have fun with Wally and Dave in a way 
that makes them seem like heroes, full-fledged participants in the human comedy 
that engages us all. The crazy gags and predicaments are never at their 
expense; the film deftly shows how the two men need to accept their limitations 
before being able to triumph over them. Part of this process is their 
realization of their need for each other's friendship. 
</P>
<P>
All of these sentiments, be assured, are left to subtext as the film careens 
merrily along. Pryor has a wonderful comic moment when necessity dictates that 
he pass himself off as a Swedish authority on geriatric sex, complete with 
yumpin' yimminy accent. This is just the broad mainstream comedy that both 
stars need in the wake of recent less-than-terrific pictures. They play off 
each other better than ever, and the good-looking "See No Evil, Hear No Evil" 
(rated R for raunchy language, some nudity) leaves us hoping we haven't seen 
the last of Wally and Dave. Maybe next time around there will be time for them 
to find girlfriends.KEVIN THOMAS

'EARTH GIRLS': THROUGH THE EYES OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Earth Girls Are Easy" (citywide) takes place in Los Angeles, but it's L.A. 
through cracked sunglasses with purple stardust frizzies on the lens. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is a jazzy, snazzy rock-musical comedy about a dumped-on Valley Girl 
who ushers three girl-crazy extraterrestrials around town after they crash-land 
in her swimming pool. And its virtuoso director, Julien Temple ("Absolute 
Beginners"), turns Los Angeles into a candy-frosted, slick dream mall, where 
Melrose Avenue, the San Fernando Valley and Ocean Avenue seem to have swallowed 
up everything. 
</P>
<P>
The city is creamed over visually with Temple's wit and impudence. He's like a 
guy who dreamed up Los Angeles out of TV and movies and then went out and found 
all the places he dreamed: found the nutty drive-ins, goofball specialty shops, 
the huge plaster doughnuts, the palm trees slashing the smoggy sky. He's even 
found Angelyne, the puffy-bosomed blonde in lavender sunglasses whose only 
raison d'etre seemed to be her omnipresent L.A. billboards -- she pops up here 
as a sultry bimbo in a BMW. 
</P>
<P>
It's the look of the movie, supposedly filtered through alien eyes, that's 
special. But the core of "Earth Girls" is too easy: slick fluff that's been 
ingeniously lacquered over, a mix of Valley Girl shop-and-chop sarcasm and 
cutie-pie sci-fi effects with the laid-back, benignly trashy mood of an old 
beach party musical. 
</P>
<P>
The script and four songs were co-written by Julie Brown, MTV's resident 
put-down specialist, as a vehicle for herself. Instead, Brown's part, Valerie 
the dippy manicurist, went to Geena Davis, with Brown recast as her girlfriend, 
boss of the Curl Up and Dye hair salon. The rest of the cast is equally 
anachronistic: Michael McKean as a burnt-out surfer and pool cleaner; Jeff 
Goldblum, Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans as the aliens from Jhazzalan, and 
ex-"Saturday Night Live" bad-mouth Charlie Rocket, as Valerie's faithless 
boyfriend, looking something like Dan Quayle as a sour-faced yuppie swinger. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's songs are cute; as Temple stages and shoots them, they're the high 
spots of the movie. But the movie is a weird hybrid. The visual satire is 
ingenious and even entrancing, like an old '50s Frank Tashlin comedy or a 
musical number by Stanley Donen and Bob Fosse. But the verbal humor has a mean, 
sluggy tartness, like the condescending cracks of rich kids at the hicko 
culture of the local styleless boobs. 
</P>
<P>
Temple has a weakness for this kind of humor; he's a wealthy Cambridge boy who 
must have liked the punks and rockers for their freedom and contempt for 
authority. But, sometimes, he seems to lack the real populist flair that a 
pop-music specialist needs, and this may be why, except for his superb rock 
videos, he hasn't caught the public fancy yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, though, the visuals triumph. "Earth Girls Are Easy" may be a 
classic case of a director getting more out of his material than it really 
deserves. Temple has spectacular gifts for making musical movies. He is a witty 
formalist, a light-hearted virtuoso, and, like all the best movie-musical 
directors, he's able to create images that breathe in tempo with the songs or 
cut against them jaggedly, exhilaratingly. 
</P>
<P>
There is one terrific example of that here: " 'Cause I'm a Blonde," a 
bimbos-on-the-beach satirical number in which Julie Brown redeems herself for 
all the script's lazy one-liners and its paucity of invention and real style. 
She gives the number a languorous, wooly-headed self-infatuated buzz, and 
Temple makes the air around her crackle. "Earth Girls Are Easy" (MPAA rated PG, 
despite sexual innuendo and partial nudity) may be the weakest piece of 
material Temple has had to work with, but he transforms it anyway. In his 
hands, the whole style of this movie becomes an apotheosis of glitz.MICHAEL

KEITH CLARK MAKES HIS PACIFIC SYMPHONY FAREWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Clark's tenure as music director of the Pacific Symphony -- the orchestra 
he founded in 1979 -- came to a bitter, poignant, perhaps humiliating end this 
week at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Clark returned to the stage after conducting Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 on 
Wednesday, and in response to audience applause led the orchestra and the 
Pacific Chorale in a hushed account of Mozart's "Ave, verum corpus" as an 
encore. 
</P>
<P>
He took a solo bow acknowledging many in the audience who were standing, then 
turned and applauded the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra did not applaud back. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of retaining Clark may at one time have divided the orchestra's board 
of directors. Some long-term subscribers may have been ruffled. Critics may 
have disagreed. Some orchestra members early on may have protested. But at the 
close the musicians spoke with unanimous voice and it was not a favorable one. 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, discussion of the actual music-making might be a bit 
extraneous were it not for the superb, songful playing of cellist Lynn Harrell. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell was soloist in Joan Tower's attractive, post-modern impressionistic 
"Music for Cello and Orchestra" and Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell negotiated Tower's many demanding double- and triple-stops with 
apparent ease. He traversed Tchaikovsky's variations with delicacy, warmth and 
poise. He was a master of evenness in dynamics and color throughout the compass 
of the instrument -- the 1673 Jacqueline Du Pre Stradivarius, according to the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Clark accompanied with care and attention, and the orchestra responded 
supportively. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came to Beethoven's Ninth, Clark gave a typically unfocused, 
dispiriting interpretation, workmanlike at best and pedantic and insensitive at 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra followed gamely. The Pacific Chorale sang with strength if not 
much clarity. 
</P>
<P>
The solo quartet, harried by Clark's hurried tempos, consisted of soprano 
Janice Yoes, mezzo-soprano Jacalyn Bower, tenor William Lewis and bass James 
Patterson (who came to grief in his opening statement). 
</P>
<P>
The program was scheduled for a repeat on Thursday. CHRIS PASLES

JOFFREY BALLET IN ASHTON PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A poet brought to his end by conflicting loves, a Chaplinesque dandy trying to 
make peace between his bride and jilted girlfriend, a trio of sleek geometric 
figures -- these subjects as explored by Frederick Ashton gave the Joffrey 
Ballet program an arresting focus Wednesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
</P>
<P>
Putting "Illuminations," "A Wedding Bouquet," and "Monotones" on a single bill 
is a stroke of inspiration. It shows the late choreographer's range, from 
surreal tragedy to arch, pre-Noel Coward comedy to abstract simplicity, and at 
the same time illustrates a common thematic thread: the pull between opposing 
forces, the eternal triangle. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing quite like "Illuminations" for phantasmagoria, its benignly 
indifferent Pierrots bobbing to the tune of Britten's nocturnal reverie. True, 
Glenn Edgerton's tormented Poet leaned more to the hedonist, defiant side than 
did Luis Perez who used to specialize in this role. But Edgerton made every 
impulse count, charging each with clarity and energy. 
</P>
<P>
Beatriz Rodriguez, as Profane Love, certainly matched his intensity on her own 
wonderfully sinewy terms, while Charlene Gehm (back with the company after an 
outing with "Phantom of the Opera") personified Sacred Love as a glowing white 
emblem held on high. 
</P>
<P>
All three returned for the other literary item, the ever-apt 1937 "Bouquet." In 
his little black mustache and pomaded hair Edgerton made a nervous Dandy caught 
between the demented Julia (Rodriguez) and his Bride. Dancing the Bride for the 
first time, Tina LeBlanc proved as knowing as her experienced cohorts. She was 
blithely lyrical, all the while dropping deft hints of demure disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"Monotones" I -- again, two women and a man, but treated as unisex by the 
pristine Cynthia Giannini, Kim Sagami and Peter Narbutas -- turned out to be 
the only weak link, its almost cheap theatricality not up to the second 
installment, reviewed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Mack sang "Les Illuminations" with lyric purity. Allan Lewis conducted 
the Britten Lord Berners' score for "Bouquet" ably. But he swamped a somewhat 
timorous David Vaughan narrating its Gertrude Stein text. DONNA PERLMUTTER

BRITISH BAND ROACHFORD ALL MIXED UP AT THE PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To enjoy the Roachford show at the Palace Wednesday night, you had to do some 
serious fantasizing. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, you had to imagine what this black British band -- fronted by 
singer-keyboardist Andrew Roachford -- would sound like with properly mixed 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
The set was maddening. Sometimes, for instance, you couldn't hear the drums. 
Then when you heard the drums, you couldn't hear the vocals. It all had a 
distancing effect on the frustrated audience, which didn't get fully involved 
no matter how hard the band was trying. 
</P>
<P>
But there were enough snatches of brilliance -- particularly in Andrew 
Roachford's singing -- to grab your attention and make you curious about seeing 
the band under better audio circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Roachford's up-tempo music is rock-based, with assorted overlays of funk, blues 
and pop. Though rock-based, the music's funk and soul elements stood out in 
concert -- especially the derivative ones. Motown and James Brown influences 
were everywhere, and Roachford's vocals often slid into that helter-skelter 
phrasing that Jimi Hendrix often used. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the sound, the other annoying aspect of Roachford's set was all those 
soul-revue cliches, which tended to cheapen the performance. 
</P>
<P>
What is most unusual about this band is its use of rock -- still rare for 
blacks, British or otherwise. Roachford is popular in Britain but its Epic 
Records debut album, "Roachford," featuring the fast-rising "Cuddly Toy" 
single, is just out in this country. Breaking Roachford into this country 
should be easier since Living Colour broke the color barrier in rock. DENNIS 
HUNT

ROYAL COURT ROCKS OUT, RATTLES NOGGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between its first and second albums, the Royal Court of China adopted a less 
regal, more raucous sound -- though it's not surprising that the band's style 
would change with a turnover of half its personnel. Did this shift mean that 
the group's show Wednesday at the Roxy was a case of musical split personality 
between the tuneful country-ish and folk touches from the first LP and the 
crunching rock from the second? 
</P>
<P>
A loud and aggressive no! These guys from Nashville are head-bangers now, pure 
and simple. They were introduced by a deejay from a heavy-metal radio station, 
and they stormed through an 11-song set of mostly current material with all the 
noggin-rattling fervor a Pure Rock fan could hope for. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in embracing the metal life, the quartet is likely to win such fans 
(and maybe a few others) wherever it plays. From the get-go of the opening 
number, "Mr. Indecision," the band unleashed a wildly spirited attack, 
musically and visually. Singer-guitarist Joe Blanton has immensely powerful 
pipes, but avoids that Siamese-cat screeching endemic to metal vocalists. 
</P>
<P>
And just when you might have been thinking that this conversion to rollicking 
rock is pretty convincing but could use a bit more humor, they encored with a 
tune called "This Is the Shortest Song in the World," which consisted of those 
eight words. Sung once. DUNCAN STRAUSS

Susan Moss bases her "Pond/Frond" paintings on the idea that 20th-Century man 
is too busy to appreciate the details in nature. "We haven't time for deep 
emotional introspection," she says in a statment about the work, going on to 
explain that her "out-of-phase landscapes are a guide to a sublime and 
spiritual place." Moss is assuming an awful lot here. While one doesn't take 
issue with her opinions on the harried pace of modern life or the healing 
properties of art and nature, exactly how these hysterical paintings function 
as a tonic to those ills remains a mystery. Moss has the shrill sense of color 
of a graffiti artist and favors Pollock's philosophy of technique; just make 
your way to a canvas and emote. While this troglodyte approach may suffice for 
the rare truly gifted genius, in lesser hands it results in run-of-the-mill 
rantings of misguided individuals harboring the illusion that their Angst is of 
interest. While one could spin Abstract Expressionist castles in the air about 
the surface tension, spatial depth and energized brush strokes in Moss' 
paintings, the best that can honestly be said about them is that they're highly 
decorative. (Boritzer/Gray Gallery, 3110 Main St., to June 4).KRISTINE McKENNA

For New Yorker Gretchen Bender, the media is a two-headed Hydra. TV, video and 
print offer us beautifully choreographed realities and access to visual 
information that expands consciousness; think of computer programs that 
generate 3-D video maps of objects or those amazing photos beamed back from 
outer space. But the looming monster "media" also accelerates that tricky, 
scary process by which the most assaultive of information quickly becomes 
humdrum and every day; consider the slow visual (and psychological) 
accommodation that's turned a psychopathic killer like "Freddy" into a 
cinematic caricature that our children can laugh at. 
</P>
<P>
In an excellent coda to her work in MOCA's "Forest of Signs," Bender 
experiments with the way that information either takes on or is drained of 
meaning. She shows an enlarged, fuzzy black-and-white photo of two bound, 
battered women hung dead over a ledge with their backs to us. Anonymous and 
strangely neutral, the bodies could be a scene from South East Asia, El 
Salvador or a still from the next war flick. Bender says she was drawn to the 
image's brutality then amazed at how quickly it no longer moved her. Playing 
artist, advertiser and political provocateur, she reinvests the photo with 
meaning by joining it to an enlarged, saturated color photo of a terribly 
mutilated finger. As she investigates her own responses to the piece (and 
controls ours), Bender raises hefty questions about the political and 
ideological power of what we habitually see. 
</P>
<P>
In an excellent floor installation Bender enlarges photographs taken from video 
screens, TV, etc., dry mounts these onto some plastic material that can be 
crumpled like rubbish and then heat hardened. Spearing these crinkled, barely 
discernable bundles of information onto upright metal lances that project out 
of the gallery floor, she orchestrates the perfect sense of horror and 
adventure, caution and fascination we all feel toward the images that barrage 
us. A wall-hung geometric puzzle painted metallic gray spouts a tendril of 
discarded film strips and a painting of an American flag that decomposes in 
special effect, 3-D fashion, fill out a handsome, compelling show by a major 
young talent. (Meyers/Bloom Gallery, 2112 Broadway, to May 27).MARLENA DONOHUE.

Allan McCollum is one of 30 young artists included in the current MOCA 
blockbuster, "Forest of Signs." In a concurrent one-man show titled "Perfect 
Vehicles," McCollum presents a suite of work based on an idea he has been 
developing since 1979. With roots in Conceptualism and Minimalism, McCollum is 
more a theoretician than an object maker, and "Perfect Vehicles" -- six solid 
concrete ginger jars, 6 1/2-feet tall and identical but for the fact that each 
is painted a different color -- offers plenty of food for thought for those of 
rarefied appetites. Stripped of historical reference, mute and inscrutable, 
these profoundly empty vessels are designed to receive the needs and desires 
that govern one's involvement with art. In other words, this is art as a blank 
screen; the viewer invests it with whatever meaning he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring ideas of surrogation, authenticity, and art's capacity to generate 
power and prestige, these mass-produced vases have the look of generic objects 
but as in work by Jeff Koons, they're actually distortions on a theme. McCollum 
intends that his perfect vehicles function as caricatures rather than symbols 
of vases, and there is something unseemly about their exaggerated size; like 
overdeveloped body builders, they have a bullying presence. Fashioning familiar 
looking forms that in fact are unlike anything else in existence (they don't 
resemble what we know as art), devoid of narrative, and completely without 
function, McCollum thwarts the impulse to invest "Perfect Vehicles" with 
superficial meaning. They remain utterly pure, three-dimensional vacuums 
waiting to be filled with that holiest of nectars, the avant garde party line. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view is an installation by Nayland Blake that centers on a short story 
titled "Bernice." Neatly printed on five green chalkboards, "Bernice" recounts 
the sorry tale of a young man smitten with his cousin, and obsessed with her 
teeth in particular. The fair maiden dies, he exhumes the corpse and extracts 
the marvelous teeth. Written in florid language evocative of Edgar Allan Poe, 
the story of "Bernice" is accompanied by four oddly kinky sculptural tableaux 
rooted in the themes of obsession and perfection. (Richard Kuhlenschmidt 
Gallery, 1634 17th St., to June 3). KRISTINE McKENNA

A Faulknerian sense of dread hangs over work by Oakland painter Leslie Lerner. 
Taking landscape as his point of departure, Lerner invests ominous dreamscapes 
with an immense sense of weight: In "A Secret Sign, I Suppose," a spark of fire 
glows in a dark void, while flaming color pours from the windows of a burning 
factory in "A Chemical Accident." 
</P>
<P>
Bathed in unearthly light, Lerner's pictures are in the tradition of mystical 
American realism that includes Edward Hopper, Winslow Homer and Charles 
Sheeler. Lush yet psychically ravaged, Lerner's images of buildings going up in 
flame and churning rivers glow with a patina of melancholy and mystery. As in 
scenes that appear to us in dreams, each detail in these troubling tableaux 
seems fraught with significance. 
</P>
<P>
Fire figures prominently in Lerner's nocturnal landscapes which are for the 
most part unpopulated and rendered in a palette dominated by blues and greens. 
A young boy turns up in two canvases, one of which, titled "A Poor Boy 
Wrestling a Shark," depicts a child alone in a small boat on a stormy sea. Ripe 
with Jungian nuance, it's an enormously compelling image, at once terrifying 
and serene; the sense of loneliness and isolation that whispers through all of 
Lerner's work lets out a blood-curdling scream in this image. As in work by New 
York artist Mark Innerst -- who paints in a similar luminous style -- there's a 
whiff of nostalgia about Lerner's atmospheric visions, awash in Renaissance 
light as they are. He brings his work up to date, however, with the toxic, 
industrial fire that recurs like a stubborn virus in his pictures. (Marilyn

Buzz Spector spent most of his childhood holed up in libraries and developed an 
intense love affair with books. He loves their feel, their smell and the great 
flood of ideas they contain. Not surprisingly his highly intelligent art pivots 
on this devotion. This exhibit takes his usual operation of ripping, stacking 
and altering books one step further to delve more deeply into the mental and 
physical enchantment of his medium. One of the show's most poignant images is 
the encaustic-covered, blank-page grid "Mensem" with its single splash of red 
paint down the center that makes the white pages reel with the feminine 
principle of life. 
</P>
<P>
But Spector has stepped out of his bookish metaphors for two of the strongest 
pieces in the show. Although the reference is still to bound volumes and the 
power of written ideas the materials are pure symbol. "Butter-Rose" is a long 
grocery freezer stocked with a bed of long-stemmed roses that have been dotted 
with great scoops of butter. Like any book, the cryonic coffin tries to 
preserve beauty, delicate flavors and aromas that become frozen, abstracted 
principles in the process. "Hospitality" is a strange wall piece made of 11 
white enamel bread pans that have been used to bake loaves of bulbous bread. 
Disturbingly, the swollen bread resembles aborted fetuses, making an analogy 
between waste and life. In the context of this show this raises associations 
between human life and vital ideas that are trashed before they have the 
opportunity to provide nourishment. Tough and uncompromising as these messages 
are, Spector can still seem non-threatening, thanks to the visual poetry of his 
materials and metaphors. (Roy Boyd, 1547 10th St., to June 1). SUVAN GEER

PREVIEW: COMICS TAKE A G-RATED STAND FOR A GOOD CAUSE

Comedy is not pretty, or so the saying goes. In many cases, it's not very clean 
either: Attend even one or two shows on the comedy club circuit and it becomes 
apparent that X-rated jokes, like the ability to exploit an amusing set of 
neuroses, are practically required equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday night at the L.A. Cabaret in Encino, a comedy club that has seen its 
share of bleepable humor, most of the jokes will be rated PG. There will still 
be plenty of jokes about love, jokes about dates, jokes about parents, coming 
of age and the general stupid behavior of inept politicians and salesclerks -- 
all the turf that comics love to grouse about. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday night's show is for charity: Proceeds will benefit the programs and 
services provided by the Los Angeles and Ventura County office of United 
Cerebral Palsy in Van Nuys. "It gets weird if you let comics do their real 
funky material during a charity event," said R. J. Johnson, the show's 
co-producer. "I don't want anyone who's come to support a family cause feeling 
uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The show is also a comedy contest. Now in its third year, Stand-Up Comics Take 
a Stand! is limited to 80 working professional comics who reach the semifinal 
round (to be held at the California Mart in downtown Los Angeles on June 16) by 
winning a runoff competition at area clubs. Ten comics will compete in Monday's 
L.A. Cabaret show, which is the sixth of nine runoff rounds. The Icehouse in 
Pasadena will be the host for the seventh runoff May 22. 
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson, the concept for Stand-Up Comics Take a Stand! came from 
comedian Gene Mitchener, who, because of a sensory nerve disorder, does his 
stand-up comedy in a wheelchair. "There are a lot of comedy contests, but most 
aren't charity events," said Johnson, who also co-produced the half-hour TV 
documentary for KTLA called "Breaking Ground," which featured success stories 
of disabled entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
The finals, which take place June 22 at the Wilshire Ebell Theater, will be 
televised in October on cable's CBN Family Channel, owned by the Christian 
Broadcasting Network. CBN also broadcast last year's show and caused a minor 
stir when it edited out some of the finalists' material, including that of 
Kathy Buckley, who happens to be hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson sees no harm in pure G-rated humor. "It's good for the audience, 
and it's good for the comics, too," he said. "I mean, if they ever get booked 
on 'The Tonight Show,' they'll need at least six or seven good clean minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 A runoff round of the comedy competition Stand-Up Comics Take a Stand! takes 
place Monday at L.A. Cabaret, 17271 Ventura Blvd., Encino. Show begins at 8 
p.m. Tickets are $5. Call (818) 782-2211 for information.

VIEIRA AND KROFT JOIN IN CBS MUSICAL CHAIRS 
</P>

<P>
CBS News correspondents Meredith Vieira and Steve Kroft will leave the 
low-rated "West 57th" magazine series for its high-rated older brother, "60 
Minutes," the network said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The shift comes three months after Diane Sawyer made her well-publicized jump 
from "60 Minutes" to ABC News to co-anchor a new prime-time series, and less 
than two months after Connie Chung left NBC to anchor what will be a revamped 
version of "West 57th" next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Vieira, 35, has been with "West 57th" since it premiered in 1985. Kroft, 43, 
joined it a year later. Their reports for "60 Minutes" will start appearing in 
the fall, when the show launches its 22nd season, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the move, CBS said the shift was intended to ensure that its 
durable Sunday news magazine series "has as bright a future as it has had a 
past and that it continues to be successful in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Vieira and Kroft will join the program's other regulars -- Morley Safer, Harry 
Reasoner, Ed Bradley and Mike Wallace, who turned 71 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The exit of Vieira and Kroft from "West 57th" leaves only Karen Burns and John 
Ferrugia remaining on that Saturday-night series. Whether they'll return with 
it next fall isn't yet known, a spokesman said. "West 57th" executive producer 
Andrew Lack is revamping the series, with Chung to serve as its anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CBS News correspondent Susan Spencer signed a new four-year 
contract, even though Chung has taken over the Sunday "CBS Evening News" that 
Spencer had been anchoring. Spencer will continue to cover the medical beat 
that she's been on since 1986, but now also will be involved in political and 
international coverage. 
</P>
<P>
And a proxy statement given to CBS shareholders at their annual meeting here 
this week showed that former "CBS Evening News" anchor Walter Cronkite will 
earn a total of $3,750,000 over a 10-year period under an agreement reached 
last September. It also said that CBS Broadcast Group President Howard 
Stringer, who until last July was head of CBS News, is negotiating a new 
contract that both sides agree will pay Stringer a total of $2.6 million for 
three years.

KOREAN TAKES SHOW ON THE ROAD -- TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Daily.

<P>
When Young-chul Kim, 35, an ambitious producer for the Mun Wha Broadcast Corp. 
in Seoul, had an idea for a new show last summer, he didn't realize how 
successful it would be. 
</P>
<P>
"MBC Song Festival for Housewives," a weekly variety show contest in which 
housewives sing with a live orchestra, has become one of the hottest programs 
in South Korea. An estimated 70% of the country's TV viewers watch the show, 
according to MBC, which is the only privately owned national TV network in 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Now Kim is bringing the show to Los Angeles, where an estimated 600,000 Korean 
immigrants live. Sponsored by Korean-language newspapers here, the "MBC Song 
Festival for Housewives" is scheduled to be taped live and presented to the 
public at the Shrine Auditorium tonight at 7. The recorded program will be 
broadcast in South Korea on May 24 as a two-hour special on the MBC-TV network. 
</P>
<P>
The show is designed solely for married housewives who stay home to take care 
of their families. After qualifying for the contest at auditions, the 
housewives compete against other housewives, singing songs that are mostly 
chosen from Korean popular tunes. Not only do they get public exposure on the 
show, but they can earn prizes. In the local contest, about $50,000 in prizes 
are at stake, including round-trip tickets to Seoul with expenses, fur coats, 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
Contestants come from as far away as Tempe, Ariz., and Pemberton, N.J. One of 
the local contestants, Mrs. Young-Ok Kang, 27, an L.A. resident for nine years, 
says: "When I will be on TV, I think lots of my friends will see me. I'm 
already calling my parents and friends in Seoul, telling them that I'll be on 
TV." A group of her family and friends bought 50 tickets to root for her. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sun-Young Lim, 28, a Buena Park resident and a college graduate who 
majored in music, is looking forward to performing on the same stage where the 
Oscar winners stood not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Although this is not for American audiences, I am sure those viewers in Korea 
will be excited about the Shrine Auditorium. Just being there and standing in 
front of my family is important to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally in Korea, whenever a group of people get together, they sing. 
Singing with families and friends is part of the culture. In many of taverns in 
Korea, if patrons offer a tip they can sing a number with the house band. 
</P>
<P>
Kim has already screened out hundreds of applicants from all over the States, 
leaving 12 finalists who will compete at the Shrine Auditorium. Kim and his 
camera crews are taping each contestant and interviewing her family members in 
order to show the that side of each contestant. Other camera crews are 
interviewing relatives and friends in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"By participating in this event," Kim says, "one can bring family unity back, 
cheering for a wife and mom." Asked why he brought this program to Los Angeles, 
he says: "I knew why so many Koreans have come to the U.S.A., since I have a 
few relatives in the States, they wanted to have second opportunities in their 
lives. Without any second thought, they are so busy making their own economic 
success. I thought I have to pay tribute to their hard work." 
</P>
<P>
MBC-TV has sent out 50 staffers, including 20 musicians for an orchestra, and 
popular entertainers as special guests. Chang-Sik Lee, deputy director of MBC 
Entertainment, says: "We will determine other future programming in foreign 
countries (depending) upon success in L.A. for "MBC Song Festival for 
Housewives."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DID FREEING OF TEEN KILLER GIVE BIRTH TO A BAD IDEA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors are distressed that a judge released a teen-ager convicted of 
second-degree murder after his defense attorney argued that the youth deserved 
to be with his girlfriend when she gave birth. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Armour, the deputy district attorney who supervises the juvenile 
division, said he was "shocked and surprised" by Judge Sheridan Reed's decision 
to release the 17-year-old from Juvenile Hall before his sentencing next 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried about the image this portrays to the community: that you can take 
a human life and still have your freedom," Armour said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's decision involved a Vista youth convicted in the fatal stabbing of 
another teen-ager during a brawl at a dance Feb. 21. He could be sentenced to 
the California Youth Authority for eight years -- until age 25. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said she was persuaded by testimony and a psychological evaluation that 
the defendant is neither a flight risk nor a danger to commit further violence. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of testimony about his good behavior," Reed said. "Testimony 
showed that the incident was not only situationally provoked but also out of 
character for him." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor, Reed said, was crowding at Juvenile Hall, which has a capacity 
of 219 but houses more than 400. 
</P>
<P>
Armour replied that he could have given Reed a list of people convicted of 
lesser crimes than second-degree murder if she felt that crowding is critical. 
</P>
<P>
Armour said he plans to talk to Reed "to make sure this isn't a trend." Reed 
said she can't remember another case of having released a convicted murderer 
before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
She conceded that her decision may be hard for the public to accept, but added: 
"As a judge, you cannot be swayed in your decision-making by whether a decision 
will be popular." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Waffles on Cookies 
</P>
<P>
Alert the media. President Bush is officially neutral on the question of 
whether the chocolate chip or the Oreo should be the national cookie. 
</P>
<P>
We know this because Rosemary Pinet Hartner, a fifth-grade teacher at Santa 
</P>
<P>
Fe-California Elementary in Vista, sent Bush letters from 21 of her students re 
Chip v. Oreo. Most were pro-chip. 
</P>
<P>
Hartner asked Bush to decide. A return letter has now been received, on White 
House stationery and signed by him: 
</P>
<P>
"How thoughtful of you to send me your essays on the national cookie. It is 
always a joy to see young citizens using their talents in a creative way. You 
can be proud of your work." 
</P>
<P>
The students' joy at receiving a reply is tempered by the fact it was 
noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
Hartner explained to her charges that the President is a politician. That 
seemed to satisfy them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antisocial Hormones 
</P>
<P>
It happened this week while the San Diego City Council was debating whether to 
ban semiautomatic weapons inside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson, who opposes such a ban, said he would rather see 
criminals who use guns locked up until they're no longer a danger to society, 
regardless of how long it takes. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "That may mean you're dead, that may mean your testosterone level is 
down so far you can barely drag yourself out of bed." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's council colleagues commenced to giggle. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "My colleagues are kidding me. That testosterone remark always gets 
a response." 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues: "Are you kidding?" 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "The truth is that it's the testosterone level in a lot of males 
that causes all this criminal activity. It's not the guns, except as a 
substitute, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Judy McCarty, fumbling on her pronunciation: "Do you propose to 
regulate testosterone activity, Mr. Henderson?" 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt: "Let's see him propose that legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "The concern that I have is that once again we're focusing society's 
energy in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
There you have have it: Use a hormone, go to jail. Call it Henderson's Law.

UCSD SCIENTISTS TRANSFER 4-COLOR GENETIC BEACONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Call it Technicolor chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Take a firefly-like Jamaican beetle, figure out what part of its genetic 
structure produces the enzymes that make it light up in various colors, and 
stick the genes into bacteria. The goal: Bacteria that glow in four different 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
That's just what researchers at UC San Diego and Johns Hopkins University have 
achieved, two years after they used a similar technique to produce 
glow-in-the-dark tobacco plants, according to a report in today's issue of 
Science magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria glow green, yellow-green, yellow and orange, thanks to the genes 
from the luminescent Jamaican click beetle. This 1-inch-long distant relative 
of the firefly looks more like a housefly than it does a beetle. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the beetle's luminescent genes is more than a genetic 
engineer's curiosity, the scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
"These genes are potentially very valuable as research tools for tracking gene 
expression -- that is, letting us know when genes are turned on or off -- in 
living systems," said Keith V. Wood, a chemistry doctoral student at UCSD and 
primary investigator on the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biological Beacons 
</P>
<P>
The light-emitting genes, which the scientists say attach readily to other 
genes, could serve as biological beacons when scientists want to simultaneously 
track the activity of several inserted genes. They also would allow researchers 
to track the fate of specific cells in the body or the spreading of genetically 
engineered microbes released into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The click beetle's genes isolated by the UCSD-Johns Hopkins team regulate 
</P>
<P>
the production in its abdominal light organ of an enzyme called luciferase. 
Luciferase converts chemical energy into light when it is combined in the light 
organ with oxygen, the energy-storage molecule ATP and a substance in the 
insects called luciferin. 
</P>
<P>
When inserted into other organisms, the low level of light the luciferase 
produces can be detected by X-ray film exposure or sensitive light-detection 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
Luciferases in fireflies and the click beetle share only about 48% of the same 
protein structure, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
But the click beetle luciferases, although they produce four different colors, 
differ only slightly in structure. As a result, the researchers are now 
modifying the luciferase gene and enzyme structures to see if they can produce 
other colors of luminescence, said William D. McElroy, emeritus professor of 
biology at UCSD and a co-author of the report in Science. 
</P>
<P>
Other authors are Y. Amy Lam, research associate in chemistry there, and Howard 
H. Seliger, professor of biology at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, this same team inserted the firefly luciferase gene into tobacco 
plants. It sent out about 350 copies of the gene to researchers and 
biotechnology companies throughout the country, McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
The click beetle research grew out of 40 years of study of firefly luciferase 
chemistry by McElroy and his late wife, UCSD chemistry professor Marlene 
Deluca, McElroy said. They first discovered that they could collect and study 
the beetles when the insects, attracted to the light of McElroy's cigar, began 
whacking into his face, he recalled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a cigar in my mouth, and here we saw something coming at the light from 
the cigar, and it was one of these charging click beetles," he said. "They kept 
coming right at me." 
</P>
<P>
This habit of the beetles proved useful for collecting them, he said, because 
the insects proved virtually impossible to breed in captivity. For the current 
research, scientists collected the beetles in Jamaica and froze them for study.

LOCKWOOD'S BUDGET PROPOSAL REDUCES FUNDING FOR RECREATION, FAILS TO ENLARGE 
POLICE FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Manager John Lockwood, calling the city's financial straits the 
gravest since the 1978 passage of Proposition 13, Thursday proposed a 
$931-million budget for fiscal 1990 that includes sizable cutbacks in 
recreation programs and a slight retreat from the city's goal of expanding its 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
With property-tax and sales-tax revenues expected to increase more slowly than 
in the past, and city population continuing to soar, the city's operating 
budget "is not keeping up with the cost of doing business," said Patricia 
Frazier, the city's director of financial management. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was the worst year we had since Proposition 13," Lockwood said. 
"This year is far worse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Difficult Choices' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very, very difficult year and the budget we're proposing for the 
council gives them some very, very difficult choices." 
</P>
<P>
The silver lining in the budgetary cloud can be found in the huge growth of 
bricks-and-mortar projects such as streets, parks, libraries and sewer 
projects. The money for those projects is budgeted to increase by $77 million 
to $260 million, most of it from sewer users' fees, developers' fees, special 
taxes and borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
The capital spending includes $8.6 million for the first year of a projected 
$45-million spruce-up of Balboa Park and $13.7 million in road construction 
from the Proposition A half-cent sales tax increase. Sewer and building 
inspection, funded by user fees, will increase substantially. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4.9% Budget Increase 
</P>
<P>
But the $404.7-million fiscal 1990 operating budget, which would increase just 
4.9% according to Lockwood's blueprint, includes a $577,000 cut in after-school 
recreation programs that would eliminate half of the 74 sites; a $205,000 
savings achieved by closing eight city-run pools for nine weeks in the spring 
and fall and the curtailment of library hours in Otay Mesa, North Park and Mira 
Mesa. A city bookmobile would be taken off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The council nixed a similar after-school recreation cut when Lockwood proposed 
it last year. "Every year, when we get the budget, they've cut Parks and Rec," 
said an aide to Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer. "And, every year, the council 
goes up and fights to put it back." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more importantly to the council and the public, the number of police 
officers would slip from 1.62 per thousand city residents to 1.59 per thousand 
city residents, despite the council's continued determination to bring the 
department's staff to a ratio of 2 officers per thousand population. 
</P>
<P>
It is the third-straight year that the council will not achieve that goal, 
which would cost an estimated $106.4 million over three years. A blue-ribbon 
panel examining ways to raise the money to finance that effort expects to 
complete its study by the end of this year, according to Lockwood's budget 
document. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood would, however, put 22 more police officers on the street by 
eliminating the positions of 21 civilians at storefront police stations around 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I find the budget totally unacceptable," said Councilman Bob Filner, who said 
he will press for across-the-board spending cuts or a tax increase to raise the 
$18.5 million required to start the push toward 2 officers per thousand 
residents. "For the third year in a row, we have made no progress toward the 
2.0 (officers) per thousand (goal), and, in fact, this year we're going 
backward." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson had a virtually identical reaction, though for 
different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't find the budget satisfactory at all," said Henderson, often credited 
with having the keenest financial mind on the nine-member council. "To cut back 
in Park and Recreation is totally unacceptable to me. Moreover, I'm very 
unhappy that we don't have any money for jails or for vocational education." 
</P>
<P>
Other council members declined to comment on the budget document because they 
had not examined it thoroughly or they could not be reached. Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor is vacationing in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
With the budgetary vise tightening around the council, Mark Nelson, executive 
director of the San Diego Taxpayers Assn., said he believes that this year's 
deliberations may produce debate on fundamental questions of what the city's 
budgetary responsibilities are. The council begins its discussions May 25. The 
1990 fiscal year starts July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue Facing Council 
</P>
<P>
"The council is going to be increasingly put in a position (of deciding) what 
are traditional municipal services," Nelson said. "Are we going to continue to 
pay for parks and recreation . . . or are we going to make them 
(self-sustaining) services?" 
</P>
<P>
A prime example, cited by both Nelson and Lockwood, is trash collection. Now 
free to single-family homeowners, trash pickups cost the city more than $20 
million coveted by Lockwood to pay for other services. San Diego is the only 
city in the county that now offers free trash collection. A vote of the public 
would be required to change the 1919 ordinance establishing free trash pickup. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's budgetary dilemma can be summed up this way: Though his operating 
budget will increase by $18.9 million, contracts with labor unions and the 
salaries of 135 top city managers will take up $12.1 million of that. That 
leaves just $6.8 million to cope with inflation and the expansion of services 
required by the estimated 27,000 more people who will be added to the city's 
population during the next fiscal year. For the first time since 1984, real per 
capita spending will decline. 
</P>
<P>
Requirements include staffing and maintaining the 15 recreation facilities 
built or enlarged by developers, staffing a new fire station and adding police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Tax Sources 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the two major sources of city revenue -- property taxes and 
sales taxes -- are increasing more slowly than in the past. The increasing 
number of home resales does not bring the city as much tax revenue as the 
construction of new homes has in the past, and the growth of suburban shopping 
complexes outside the city limits such as North County Fair in Escondido and 
Car Country Carlsbad hinders the growth of sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The result is less money to go around. Lockwood proposes placing just $1 
million -- 0.25% of the budget -- in the city's rainy-day fund. Another $27.1 
million in top-priority needs are left unfunded in the proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of the times, he is budgeting $8 million to pay off lawsuit 
losses. The city has already spent about $10 million on such losses this year. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposed cut would eliminate cleanup at Mission Bay Park and all other 
shoreline parks between 3 p.m and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Departments not facing outright budget reductions will have to do more with 
less. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to have to get more and more out of our people as we go 
along," Lockwood said.

POSTING OF GUARDSMEN AT BORDER DRAWS CRITICISM OF LATINO GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 36 National Guardsmen who have been posted at the Otay Mesa border crossing 
to aid U. S. Customs officials as a help in stopping drug smuggling drew harsh 
criticism Thursday from some Latino community members. They called the move a 
step toward militarization of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the National Guard and the U. S. Customs Service refused to 
provide details on how long the operation will last or exactly how many troops 
were posted, saying it would compromise security. The unarmed guardsmen have 
been inspecting containers and truck cargo, not private cars, in the joint 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican consul general in San Diego, Hermilo Lopez-Bassols, was in Mexico 
City on business but other community members voiced anger at the posting of 
troops. The planned deployment had already drawn sharp criticism in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Our organization has been opposed to the militarization of the border. This is 
a first step," said Irma Castro of the Chicano Federation. "We have to deal 
with Customs and (the Border Patrol), why does the National Guard have to be 
there doing the Customs Service's job? What kind of message is this going to 
send to both visitors to California as well as residents?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Congestion 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Martinez is director of the U. S.-Mexico Border Program for the 
American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit organization that monitors 
immigration policies and advocates immigrant rights. "To take this kind of step 
toward militarization at the border is not only going to strain U. S.-Mexico 
relations. . . . We don't need another agency on the border that we have to 
monitor," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Goding, a customs house broker for International Automated Brokers, 
said the posting of the National Guard had increased congestion and upset 
truckers. Her company completes the paper work for importers. She estimated the 
wait for some truckers at two hours. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Mexico border, stretching for almost 2,000 miles, is considered a 
prime entry point for an array of illegal drugs, notably cocaine, marijuana and 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Steve Mensik, a spokesman for the state National Guard in Sacramento, said 
the purpose of the operation is "to put more eye and hands in the searching 
aspect to stem the flow of narcotics." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ritz, a spokesman for the National Guard in Los Angeles, said: "The United 
States government finds it necessary to step up efforts at drug interdiction, 
and the use of the National Guard is simply one way to assist U. S. Customs in 
the effort to quell the influx of drugs into the U. S." 
</P>
<P>
Mensik said the troops could be moved, at the direction of Customs officials 
from the border to the ports of Long Beach or Los Angeles, two other areas 
where National Guardsmen have been recently deployed to combat drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A First for California 
</P>
<P>
"They arrived (at the Otay crossing) about Sunday or Monday. They're going to 
be in various places throughout the month. I'm reluctant to say they're going 
to be right there for the whole month," Mensik said. "Because of the fluidness 
of the operation, the number's going to vary. It could be 50 to 60 today or 
four tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the National Guard has been involved in container 
inspection in California, but similar anti-drug smuggling programs have been 
run in Florida and Texas. Mensik said the program will be evaluated when it is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
There is no plan to arm the soldiers, Mensik said. "There's no need for it." 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we will be inspecting are containers and truck cargo . . . that 
may free up more Customs people to spend more time with the you and me driving 
through in our private automobile." 
</P>
<P>
The Otay Mesa, Long Beach and Los Angeles operations have been federally 
funded. Mensik said Congress has appropriated $40 million for the National 
Guard "to support drug interdiction and eradication" around the country. 
Several other states plan to run similar operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Customs spokesman John Miller said about 800 National Guardsmen have been 
activated in eight states to fight drug smuggling. About 300 National Guardsmen 
are now deployed in California, he said.

Two Chula Vista motorists were seriously injured Thursday after a head-on 
collision on East H Street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista police said that Ronald Etling, 23, crossed over the center line 
and crashed into a car driven by Anita Lopez, 55, at about 2:45 p.m.

<P>
Police are alerting motorists parking in the Old Town area that a rash of car 
burglaries has hit the tourist spot since the beginning of the year, Police 
Department spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 car burglaries have been reported by motorists, mostly tourists, 
in the Old Town area since Jan. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have told police that the thieves watch people leave their cars, then 
smash the car windows to take valuables inside, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason tourists are hit in many cases is because they're in town for just 
a weekend or the holiday, and then they return home and cannot return to San 
Diego to testify," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said anyone who has information on the series of thefts is asked to 
call Detective Emmitt Henderson at 236-7310.

EX-SAN DIEGO POLICE OFFICER SAYS POLITICAL PRESSURE CAUSED HIS FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allen A. Stovall testified Thursday that he was unjustly fired as a San Diego 
police officer for an incident last year in which he said he and a fellow 
officer fought back against a drunken man whose wife was jumping on them and 
wildly screaming, "Get their guns! Shoot them!" 
</P>
<P>
"Given the circumstances, given the facts that we could have had an armed 
suspect and given the fact we had a violent crowd, I think the level of force 
we used was not only appropriate, but minimal," Stovall told the city's Civil 
Service Commission, which is considering his request for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in lots of situations where officers have been hurt, including 
myself," the 28-year-old Stovall added. "And this situation was definitely 
progressing to where an officer was going to be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
A three-year police veteran, Stovall was dismissed in December from the San 
Diego Police Department. His termination notice cited the March, 1988, assault 
in the Harbor View area, where he allegedly kicked a man in the groin, struck 
him in the ribs with his police baton, then sprayed Mace in the man's face. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brutality Complaint 
</P>
<P>
The notice also referred to an 1987 brutality complaint against Stovall in 
which he struck a man with the butt of his shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing Thursday, Stovall said he believed that the new 
administration of Police Chief Bob Burgreen, who has pledged to severely 
discipline officers for misconduct, made an unfair example of him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a lot of political pressure," Stovall said. "He came out with a 
statement that he's not going to tolerate any police officers who are abusive, 
and I support that. But I don't believe I was being abusive." 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Kenneth Moller, in defending the department's decision to strip 
Stovall of his police badge, said both cases of alleged excessive force 
indicate a pattern of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the second kind of incident Officer Stovall was involved in that 
involved excessive force," Moller said. "If there had been no prior case, I 
would not have recommended termination." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Gonzalez testified Wednesday that the March, 1988, incident began after a 
gang fight and drive-by shooting erupted on his block near State and Date 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, when he asked Stovall and Officer Frank Almond Jr. what had 
happened, he was immediately seized and pinned against a street sign pole. He 
said that, although Almond held his arm twisted around the pole, Stovall kicked 
him six times in the groin, thumped him with the baton and sprayed Mace into 
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Stovall told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, when he and Almond investigated the shooting, Gonzalez was 
pointed out to them as a possible suspect or witness. He said they tried to 
interview him, but Gonzalez became angry and belligerent and refused to 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran toward him and grabbed his arm to try to stop him," Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and Almond were trying to subdue Gonzalez so they could handcuff him 
and discuss the shooting. He said he placed Gonzalez in a chokehold, but then 
eased up. 
</P>
<P>
"I let him go because I heard someone shouting, 'Take their guns and kill 
them,' " Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Stovall and Almond testified that Gonzalez's wife, Guadalupe Gonzalez, was 
highly emotional, shouting and screaming. They said she was jumping on them and 
encouraging a crowd of about 15 bystanders to disarm the officers and shoot 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was grabbed" by Guadalupe Gonzalez, Stovall said. "I was jumped on. Somebody 
pulled on my gun belt. There were several times I thought I was going to lose 
my gun." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sprayed Mace 
</P>
<P>
He said he sprayed Mace at her husband once, but that Jose Gonzalez continued 
to struggle. Stovall said he then kicked him twice, aiming at the man's thighs. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, he stopped fighting," Stovall said. "We handcuffed him, and he 
was under arrest." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever hit Mr. Gonzalez with your baton?" asked his attorney, Everett 
Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever touch Mr. Gonzalez with your baton?" 
</P>
<P>
"Never." 
</P>
<P>
However, under cross-examination by Deputy City Atty. Rick Pinckard, Stovall 
said that Jose Gonzalez only pushed at him, but never kicked or swung back at 
him during the altercation. He also said he never told Gonzalez that he was 
placing him under arrest before or during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Thursday, Sgt. Donald L. Fasching, who teaches defensive 
tactics at the Police Academy, said Stovall was more than justified in using 
his feet, the baton and the Mace against Gonzalez, particularly because of the 
lethal threats from Gonzalez's wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd resort to whatever force option was available to me," Fasching said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said it would release its decision on the case within 30 days.

SUSPECT IN FATAL STABBING SURRENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fight led to the fatal stabbing of a man in East San Diego Thursday night, 
San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Gregory Purvis, 31, had been involved in a fight with Steve Pippin, 
24, about 6 p.m. near Date Place and Altadena Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Upset, Pippin went into a nearby residence and returned about 20 minutes later 
with a knife, looking for Purvis, police said. Pippin found Purvis seated in a 
car, stabbed him in the chest and called to turn himself in, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Purvis died about an hour later at Mercy Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police late Thursday night said they had not yet determined a motive. Pippin is 
in custody on suspicion of murder.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: INDIAN RESTAURANT NO JEWEL OF THE ORIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indian food can be dainty, warlike, suggestive, coy, ferocious, introspective, 
as perfumed as a rose-scented breeze blowing in from the Vale of Kashmir, as 
sultry as a Calcutta side street, as refreshing as a monsoon. 
</P>
<P>
As nearly abundant in personalities as the Hindu pantheon, Indian food can 
beguile the taste buds, and it can also deliver them a near-fatal KO. Those 
scientists searching for nuclear fusion in a flask might investigate Madras 
curries, which at times seem to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Indian food can be, it should never be humdrum, although this danger 
awaits any style of cooking that makes its way to these shores -- many 
cuisines, when tossed into the American melting pot, come out assimilated and 
amorphous. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's supply of Indian restaurants has remained fairly constant over the 
years, and it expanded only slightly when La Jolla's Star of India opened a 
branch of the same name in the Lumberyard center in Encinitas. This is the sort 
of place where diners might want to park their karmas outside, because it is 
not the Indian restaurant that North County has been waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lackadaisical Attitude 
</P>
<P>
A lackadaisical attitude pervades the place and probably accounts for the 
lackluster cooking. On both of two visits, a television in the front room 
loudly played prime-time fare for the passing amusement of the staff, but it 
intruded terribly at the table. And the housekeeping seemed erratic; a table 
was set with a vase of four definitely dead daisies that should have been 
carted off to the flower morgue the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
A basic Indian meal consists of bread, rice, a mildly or highly seasoned 
vegetable or meat main dish, a relish or two (there are dozens of chutneys and 
pickles from which to choose), and often yogurt and a dish of dal, a soupy 
preparation made from lentils or other dried legumes. The menu embraces 10 
categories and offers plenty of choice within each. 
</P>
<P>
Granting that variety is the spice of life, the variety of spicing at Star of 
India lends little life to the cooking. There is no law that decrees that 
Indian food must be hot, and indeed, were all dishes to rage, the effect would 
be boring. But those curries that should be hot are timorous at best, and 
temerity is not what one seeks in a gosht vindaloo (typically, a volcanic lamb 
curry) or a prawn bhuna (customarily a dish of some fire). 
</P>
<P>
The best that can be said of Star of India is that it places three relishes on 
the table as a matter of course, and these can be used, when desired, to fire 
up dishes that need a spark or two to bring them to life. The selection 
encompasses a mild tamarind chutney, a stronger mint chutney and a "mixed 
pickle," or chopped vegetables in oil heated with chilies and spices. This last 
achieves nearly the correct degree of piquancy and helps some dishes mightily 
-- although when made properly, some dishes would not require its assistance. 
(An extreme example of potent Indian relishes is a special mustard pickle that 
is available at only a few import shops. This may be hard to believe, but by 
simply opening the jar and placing it at the end of the table, the mustard 
pickle will provide seasoning from a distance.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Started 
</P>
<P>
The list of snacks offered as starters consists almost exclusively of battered 
and fried items. In this list are onion strips (bhaji), a little crisper than 
American onion rings and nice with the mint chutney, and various pakora, or 
fried tidbits of fish, chicken, vegetables and cheese. The menu advertised the 
paneer pakora as mint-filled slices of farmer cheese, dipped in batter and 
crisped; there was no evidence of mint, and the server said that, in his 
experience, mint had never entered the dish. At $6.75 an order, which is an 
excessive price for a plate of cheese fingers, the kitchen could take the 
trouble to make the dish correctly -- who are they trying to fool? 
</P>
<P>
The samosas, or stuffed pastries, were happier, particularly those filled with 
spiced lamb. The vegetable samosas, filled with a barely seasoned mixture of 
cubed potatoes and peas, were less interesting but did fit the Indian 
vegetarian motif; in both cases, bites of the mixed pickle brought out savory 
tones that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
The curries tend to repeat from category to category, much in the way Chinese 
menus list various meats prepared in identical fashions. Thus chicken, lamb and 
shrimp all can be had (supposedly), in a vindaloo treatment, which usually 
means in a sauce that brings tears to the eyes. The lamb vindaloo, however, was 
anything but hot, and for some reason included bits of celery that had been 
thrown in at the last minute and were annoyingly hard -- the sensation they 
provoked was akin to that of finding pebbles in a plate of pea soup. The same 
foods also can be had in saag, a mild, creamy spinach sauce. Other treatments 
include sauces of tomatoes, peppers and onions. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp should not necessarily be treated to an excess of spice, although they 
can benefit from it at times. Star of India's prawn bhuna, advertised as in a 
"spicy gravy of coconut and onions," was almost like one of those limp American 
stroganoffs that are based on canned cream of mushroom soup. A sweet note of 
coconut pervaded the sauce, which otherwise was remarkably bland and 
uncharacteristically pasty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vegetarian Offerings 
</P>
<P>
Star of India does offer a good selection of vegetarian dishes, which, 
surprisingly, many Indian restaurants do not. These include mattar paneer (peas 
and cheese in sauce); channa masala (curried garbanzo beans); navrattan korma 
(creamed mixed vegetables) and Punjabi aloo, a very typical dish of potatoes, 
onions and tomatoes. The fanciest may be the vegetable kofta, or meatball-like 
fried dumplings in a mildly curried sauce of moderate interest; a subtler 
selection is the bengan bartha, or eggplant baked in a sauce that contains 
onions, peas and tomatoes. There was a richness to this last, but the kitchen 
sent it out cool, and it needed to be hot to be palatable. The basmati rice 
that accompanied all dishes also arrived at room temperature, a disgraceful 
lapse for an Indian restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen does shine when it comes to sending out hot, just-cooked Indian 
breads. Most are flat, and all arrive steaming and greasy (but delicious) with 
a film of melted butter. Stars in this department are the roasted, whole wheat 
paratha and the related poori, which is fried; aloo paratha, a fancier 
variation, are stuffed with potatoes and cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
Indian desserts seem designed more to shock the mouth with sweetness than to 
cause any other effect, and Star of India offers the usual ones, including 
gulab jaman, or cheese balls soaked in syrup. This dessert is sufficient after 
one of the Star's flabby curries; should a really sharp curry ever come your 
way, follow it with ice cream.

CHOICES AND COSTS IN HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on health insurance touched briefly on a few important issues 
dealing with the health insurance industry. I would briefly like to address one 
of the concepts discussed. Health insurance shoppers should acquire the most 
reasonably priced plan that yields the coverage that an individual or family 
requires, yet these people should always expect to pay more in premiums than 
they receive in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of all insurance is not to get your money's worth. Insurance is 
designed to protect us from rare and unusual circumstances which could 
financially ruin an individual or a family. I believe most people purchasing 
life, automobile, home, fire, liability, and earthquake insurance hope they 
never have to collect on their policies. It is generally accepted that we will 
pay large sums of money to corporations for protection that we will hopefully 
never use. 
</P>
<P>
For some strange reason, our society feels health insurance is different. The 
whole concept of the insurance industry is based on the idea that many people 
will pay premiums for the benefit of the few who will collect. Why then do many 
people over-utilize their health insurance plans if significant roadblocks 
(deductibles, co-payments, long waits for appointments) are not put in their 
way? Without these barriers, many people feel it is their right to utilize 
their policies for many self-limited and simple problems such as colds, flu, 
minor strains and sprains, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The individual's decision in choosing a health care plan depends on his/her 
needs and expectations, but we must remember that the system is designed so 
that we will not get what we pay for! For an individual, I can only recommend 
trying to choose the health care coverage which is best suited to his/her 
personality and needs in the event of a significant illness. Remember that if a 
plan looks "too good to be true," like most things in life, it probably is.

ANTI-SMOG PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How can AQMD officials expect us to believe they are truly serious about air 
quality when everywhere I look diesel trucks and buses spewing out clouds of 
acid fumes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? 
</P>
<P>
Why does the AQMD look the other way and never mention the fact, or only in a 
token way? 
</P>
<P>
This has been going on for years, and I see no effort on the part of the diesel 
industry to do anything about controlling emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of dollars worth of controls have been required on cars for years. I 
see no matching effort on diesel vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Is the trucking industry so insensitive as to think it has no responsibility? 
After all, truckers have to live here too. Even our tax-supported school buses 
and transit city buses are major offenders. 
</P>
<P>
It is time that a serious effort is made to control diesel emissions. If diesel 
emissions were controlled, I am sure the dirty brown smudge that hangs over the 
Los Angeles and Orange County basins would disappear. 
</P>
<P>
The token ticketing of trucks for emission violations is totally ineffective. 
Why is the El Toro Marine Base allowed to burn its waste oil -- releasing huge 
clouds of black smoke into the atmosphere? This compounds the problem. This 
doesn't make sense to me!

PORNOGRAPHY CASE RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it any wonder that sexual crime is on the increase in our society? 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other residents of the Los Angeles area, I was appalled to 
hear U.S. District Judge David Kenyon say he is unable to determine whether 
violent, degrading pornographic films violate community standards ("Porno Case 
Is Dismissed; L.A. Diversity Cited," Part I, May 4). 
</P>
<P>
Whether Kenyon recognizes it or not, there are standards of morality and 
decency that are held sacred by a large majority of people in this community. 
</P>
<P>
His decision to dismiss charges brought by the federal government against one 
of Los Angeles' most blatant and repulsive distributors of hard-core 
pornography is a slap in the face of the fine, decent folks who believe in and 
want to uphold and maintain high standards of morality in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
In granting acquittal, Judge Kenyon has come down on the side of immorality and 
indecency. 
</P>
<P>
Shame on you, Judge Kenyon!

JIM MURRAY: LAKERS TOOK PUNCH AWAY FROM SONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody in the Forum knew what the Seattle SuperSonics had to do to beat the 
Lakers: Get the ball to Dale Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
When they couldn't do it, the next day's headlines were already guaranteed: 
"Wipeout! Lakers Blow it Open." 
</P>
<P>
When Dale Ellis gets off 12 shots, most of them poor, Seattle is handing over 
its sword. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle is a team that relies on muscle, not guile. It makes its fight like a 
swarmer, a brawler. The Lakers are more like somebody who would be called Sugar 
Ray. They can knock you out but first they make you dizzy with jabs and 
footwork. Teams like the SuperSonics spend most of the night looking for them. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers handled Dale Ellis Wednesday night as if he had just got off a load 
of turnips. They know where he likes to shoot from. And they made sure he never 
got there. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody did a good job in the scouting report," said Ellis, a quiet but 
accessible young man who looks not unlike the sprinter, Carl Lewis. "They know 
the shot I like and they steered me away from it all night." 
</P>
<P>
You get a measure of how important the Lakers feel Dale Ellis is to the Seattle 
offense when you know that the Lakers switched off four people guarding him 
through the night, and sometimes it seemed as if all four were on him at once. 
</P>
<P>
"When Dale is being double- and triple-teamed, logic would dictate one or two 
people would be open somewhere," his coach, Bernie Bickerstaff, said in some 
exasperation. "We can't seem to find them." 
</P>
<P>
The Laker strategy seemed to be to let Seattle's lesser gunner, Xavier 
McDaniel, have his shots and concentrate on smothering Dale Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
The plot seemed to work. McDaniel got 17 points, and the Lakers shrugged. Ellis 
got 14 on five baskets -- but two of them were three-pointers from desperation 
range. He missed three other three-pointers. Clearly, the league likes to make 
Ellis shoot from the boondocks. He got no point-blank shots all night. He 
needed a cannon. The basket was on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis has to get his shots for the Sonics to boom. He led the club this year 
with 2,253 points, or 27.5 a game. It behooves the Lakers to chop that in half. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis salutes them for doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best they've played against us all year," he said. "They put a lot 
of pressure on our point guard, and I wasn't getting the passes." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so long ago that league brain trusts didn't spend that much time 
trying to neutralize Ellis, or see to it he didn't get many passes. The career 
of Dale Ellis is a classic illustration of the sporting question, "What's so 
smart about basketball?" 
</P>
<P>
You know right away something is badly awry when you look at a basketball guide 
and see where Dale Ellis, playing for the Dallas Mavericks, scored 508 points 
or 7.1 a game one year -- and the very next, scored 2,041 or about 25 points a 
game for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Had the Mavericks just kept him around to in-bound the ball, go 
in for guys in foul trouble? Or did they just tell him to dish off to Mark 
Aguirre in the unlikely event he did get his hands on the ball? 
</P>
<P>
"They had no confidence in me," Ellis explained as he sat in a locker room, 
contemplating his team's second straight loss to the Lakers the other night. 
"That way you start to get no confidence in yourself. I had to get out of 
there." 
</P>
<P>
When he got traded to Seattle, Bickerstaff could see right away what the 
trouble was. Ellis was out of position. It wasn't that he was playing the post 
incorrectly, or was playing off the wrong foot on the give-and-go, he was in 
the wrong place on the court when the game started. 
</P>
<P>
All his life he'd been a forward -- through high school in Georgia, at college 
and with the Mavericks. It was almost as bad a call as thinking Babe Ruth was a 
pitcher or Gary Cooper an architect. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-7, he'd be a small forward but a big guard. At guard, even off guard, 
he wouldn't need somebody to get him the ball, he'd have it. Bickerstaff 
drooled at the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"He handled the ball so well in our drills," recalled Bickerstaff. "He had the 
lateral equipment, he could see the whole court. I figured if we put some hard 
work in it, he could make an outstanding guard." 
</P>
<P>
He did better than that. He became one of the league's best. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to move Gerald Henderson and give him the spot," added Bickerstaff. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still learning the position," said Ellis. "I feel more comfortable in it 
every day but I'm going to school in it every night." 
</P>
<P>
With Magic Johnson and Byron Scott and Michael Cooper dealing out the lessons 
these nights, Ellis couldn't have a better faculty. Trouble is, unless the 
Sonics find a way to get him his shot, school may be out. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things Professors Johnson, Scott and Cooper are teaching him -- 
pounding into him -- is that it's hard to win the championship from three-point 
range.

SULLIVAN INJURED IN CRASH AT INDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Four years ago, Danny Sullivan did a 360-degree spin during the Indianapolis 
500, never hit a thing, continued merrily on his way and won the race. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, he was not so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was running at 219 m.p.h. during practice for this year's race when 
the engine cover flew off his Penske-Chevrolet as he approached the third turn 
at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
The national champion appeared to have control of the sliding car as it started 
to spin, but suddenly the change in aerodynamics spun it completely around and 
flung the car into the outside wall with a tremendous impact. The right side of 
the $100,000 machine was wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was cut out of the car and taken immediately to Methodist Hospital, 
where his injuries were diagnosed as a mild concussion, a broken right forearm 
and a bruised right foot. He underwent surgery and was to remain in the 
hospital overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Penske, owner of the car Sullivan was driving, was optimistic that his 
driver could still drive in the 500 May 28. 
</P>
<P>
"If Dr. (Terry) Trammell can put a plate in his arm, it wouldn't be a problem 
for Danny to drive," Penske said. "It would just be a matter of him getting 
used to some sort of arm cast. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a backup car ready for him. If he is released, we'll have him at best 
back in the car by this weekend and ready to qualify the second weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying will start Saturday and continue Sunday and next weekend to fill the 
33-car field. 
</P>
<P>
"Sullivan was awake and alert and in good condition," Trammell said. "As of 
now, we are uncertain of his driving status, but that may be determined after 
an examination (Saturday) morning." 
</P>
<P>
Trammell is a specialist in patching together injured race drivers, among them 
Sullivan's Penske teammate and defending 500 champion, Rick Mears, who badly 
injured both feet in an accident in August, 1984, outside Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
After Sullivan's crash, Mears carefully studied the skid marks in an attempt to 
determine the cause and effect of the incident. Mears, who had run 220.696 
m.p.h. earlier in the day, did not return to the track. 
</P>
<P>
Mears still has the fastest lap of the month, 225.733, set under ideal weather 
conditions last Monday. Gusty winds bothered drivers Thursday as Jim Crawford 
had the fastest lap of 221.021. 
</P>
<P>
If Sullivan is unable to drive in the 500, speculation around the garage area 
was that Geoff Brabham, the International Motor Sports Assn. champion and 
driver of the Nissan GTP car in IMSA, would get the nod. Two years ago, after 
another Penske driver, Danny Ongais, was injured, Penske picked Al Unser to 
fill in for Ongais -- and Unser won the race. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the first time Sullivan had been injured in a racing accident in 
his 17-year career.

WHEN MINTON'S LIFE TURNED UP, HIS PITCHES STAYED DOWN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Minton sat in the lobby of a Toronto hotel, a novel open in his lap but 
his mind on his teammates in the nearby bar. The Angels' game with the Blue 
Jays had been rained out, and the players had a couple of hours to kill before 
flying on to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Minton would have pushed his considerable belly up to the bar. But the 
1989 Greg Minton stared at his book and practiced self-control. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have loved to go in there, but I sat in the lobby and read my book 
like a good little boy," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Minton once stole the team bus. Now, he's one of the first guys aboard. He 
used to eat, drink and make merry until dawn, then sleep into the afternoon. 
Now, he's up early, has run a few miles before breakfast and can look forward 
to a hearty salad and a couple of iced teas for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"My metabolism ain't what it used to be," said Minton, 38, forcing a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Minton may not party as much as he once did, but he feels a lot better about 
himself. Once a 248-pound behemoth who elicited jeers from the hometown fans in 
San Francisco whenever he warmed up, which wasn't often, he's now a svelte 
crowd-favorite who leads the team with 14 appearances. He has a 1.69 earned-run 
average with three saves and has been a vital factor in the Angels' early 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Greg's pitching now, he's invaluable," Manager Doug Rader said. "He 
has the ability to be a set-up guy, to come in in the early innings and get us 
out of a precarious situation, or be a closer. He's just done an exceptional 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Minton has changed his act, but there's one thing he has retained from the 
early '80s, when he was one of the National League's premier relievers -- a 
nasty, sinking fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a really great arm," catcher Lance Parrish said. "I love the way he 
throws the ball -- wish I could make a ball move like that. The ball looks like 
it's in a good spot to hit, but then when you commit, it suddenly drops down . 
. . the bottom just falls out of it." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Minton's life matched that description. 
</P>
<P>
Minton married at 17 and when the marriage fell apart, his career followed 
suit. He gained weight and lost interest in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing was the divorce," Minton said. "And then I lost a custody 
battle for my kids. Let's just say I was not a happy camper. To be honest, 
baseball had become very secondary in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Minton recorded 111 saves for the Giants between 1980 and 1984. In 1982, he had 
a 10-4 record, 30 saves and a 1.83 ERA. But the fans in San Francisco quickly 
forgot when his waistline bulged and his save totals shrank. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nobody's fault but my own," Minton said. "I mean I was totally out of 
shape and the Giants were paying me a goodly sum of money to do a job. I'm not 
sure anyone should have to endure some of the choice words that were directed 
toward me and my family. It was my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Single for the first time since high school, Minton "took too much advantage of 
being a single human being . . . you can read into that what you will." 
</P>
<P>
But somehow, Minton had lost the youthful exuberance that characterized his 
early days in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
After all, there is a certain lightheartedness in swiping the team bus to go 
buy boots, as he once did in Houston, and then driving it to the park. Or 
hang-gliding his way to a $200 fine on a day off. Or tricking a teammate into 
knocking on the manager's hotel room door at 4 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
But there is nothing lighthearted about carousing and getting fat. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly didn't set out to let myself go," he said. "I gained a few pounds, 
then a few more, and weighed 220 before I realized I had a problem. I made a 
few halfhearted efforts to catch myself, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Then Minton met his current wife, Brenda, and he found the inspiration he 
needed. Together, they began the climb back up. 
</P>
<P>
Minton was 1-1 with one save and a 3.47 ERA when the Giants released him on May 
28, 1987. Five days later, the Angels picked him up, in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
"Three things stick in my mind about those first days with the Angels," Minton 
said. "When I first got here (pitching coach Marcel Lachemann) asked me how my 
arm felt. I said I hadn't pitched in five days, but I felt fine. He told me to 
be ready for the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Then (former manager) Gene Mauch called me into his office and said he didn't 
care what he'd heard . . . that he had no preconceived notions, that I was 
starting from scratch as far as he was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I pitched that first night in New York. Then I pitched again on our first 
night back in Anaheim. When I came to the mound, I heard cheering. I went home 
to tell Brenda, but I couldn't put into words the way it made me feel." 
</P>
<P>
Brenda is Minton's fitness director and during the off-season has him running 
10 miles every morning. They both adhere to a strict diet, and he regularly 
works out with a former U.S. national taekwondo coach near his home in Gilbert, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Minton once went more than three seasons without allowing a home run while 
setting a major league record of 269 1/3 consecutive innings without giving up 
a homer. He just set the Angel club record with 88 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Former Giant Manager Frank Robinson once said he thought Minton could pitch the 
ninth inning of all 162 games if he had to. But the arm that wouldn't die needs 
rest now. 
</P>
<P>
Making his fourth appearance in five games last Saturday, Minton gave up a 
two-run double, a walk and a warning-track sacrifice fly while facing just 
three Toronto batters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm learning things about my body at this age," Minton said. "It use to be, 
the more I threw, the more the ball sank. Now, I'm learning that even if I feel 
fine, sometimes I don't have the arm speed I need if I've been out there too 
many days in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Minton's style relies more on arm whip than arm strength and a lack of work can 
be a problem, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always relied on one trick pitch and if the ball doesn't sink, I can 
throw 100 m.p.h. and it won't do any good. In fact, when I'm all fired up and 
doing my Nolan Ryan impersonation, feeling like I'm gonna throw it right by 
them, that's when I get into trouble. After a couple of hits, I realize that I 
couldn't throw it by 'em at 25 so I sure as hell can't throw it by anyone at 
38."

GIAMATTI SETS ROSE HEARING DATE: MAY 25 
</P>

<P>
With seemingly ominous overtones for Pete Rose and his baseball future, 
Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti said Thursday that he has reviewed special 
counsel John Dowd's report on the Cincinnati Reds' manager's alleged gambling 
activity and has invited him to a hearing May 25. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti said he would determine Rose's status after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Rose has testified, but is owed, in my opinion, an opportunity to review 
the report and its accompanying materials, and thereafter to respond to me, if 
he wishes to do so," Giamatti said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I have set a hearing date for May 25 . . . in my office." 
</P>
<P>
Said a member of the commissioner's staff who declined to be identified: 
</P>
<P>
"If Bart didn't feel there was something there, he wouldn't be having a 
hearing. If he didn't feel there was something there, he would have announced 
that the report had cleared Pete." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing satisfies baseball's administrative rules and could serve as a 
response to the possibility of a federal suit by Rose, charging that he has 
been deprived of due process. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, under baseball rules, can suspend Rose for a year if he is found to 
have bet on baseball, and for life if he bet on the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
He could also face suspension for associating with gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the commissioner's inquiry, a federal grand jury in Cincinnati 
is reportedly investigating Rose for possible income-tax evasion stemming from 
his gambling activities. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement Thursday, Giamatti said: "I have now studied the report of 
John Dowd. It is a report of 225 pages and is supported by seven volumes of 
exhibits containing depositions, statements, documents, reports, transcripts 
and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
"Some 40 witnesses were interviewed and many were re-interviewed, including 
Pete Rose, who provided testimony over two days. 
</P>
<P>
"The complexity, the amount of effort and the intensity of the investigation is 
reflected in the report and its accompanying materials. I am confident that the 
amount of time it took to complete the investigation and prepare the report was 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Rose and his counsel have been sent the report and all the accompanying 
exhibits and materials. They have received all the information the special 
counsel has relied upon in support of his report and on which I will rely in 
making my judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to do my utmost to protect the confidentiality of all this material 
until such time as I decide on the ultimate disposition of the report. That 
decision will come after hearing from Mr. Rose and after I have reached a 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
In a cover letter sent with the Dowd report, Giamatti cautioned Rose and his 
attorneys against copying the material or making any of it public. 
</P>
<P>
Reuven Katz, one of Rose's attorneys, confirmed Thursday that he had received a 
copy of the report and said he and his colleagues would decide on an 
appropriate response after reviewing it. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd told the Cincinnati Enquirer: "In terms of the time, effort and care we 
invested in the inquiry, I was very satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has been going on for some time and I know that bothered a lot of 
people. I know it has been difficult for Pete Rose. But you can't put enough 
effort and care into something like this. It is not something you rush." 
</P>
<P>
Rose has denied betting on baseball and betting with bookmakers. He confirmed 
Thursday that he met with Dowd for two days in Cincinnati, said again that he 
has done nothing that would result in a suspension and is, at least, happy to 
know that the ordeal is winding down. 
</P>
<P>
"The last two months have seemed like five years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Reds' owner Marge Schott: "It's been hard on the club, on the fans and on 
Pete. Everyone is glad it will soon be over."

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: OPTIONS ARE OPEN FOR ABDUL-JABBAR AFTER THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does a 7-foot-2 basketball center do after he retires? 
</P>
<P>
If you're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, almost anything you want to do. 
</P>
<P>
And what Abdul-Jabbar wants to do is get into the television and entertainment 
business, but not necessarily behind a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
"People have suggested I get into basketball commentating," he said. "But 
that's not what I want to do, at least not now." 
</P>
<P>
What interests Abdul-Jabbar is producing films. He has formed his own company, 
Kareem Productions, which has already completed two projects. 
</P>
<P>
One is a one-hour special, "All-Star Tribute to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar," which 
will be on NBC tonight at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Due to some ingenious programming by NBC, it runs opposite the Lakers' 7:30 
game at Seattle on Channel 9, so if you're a Laker fan and interested in yet 
another Kareem tribute, you'll have to crank up the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Cossette, producer of the Grammy Awards show, and Abdul-Jabbar are the 
co-executive producers of the star-studded special, which was taped April 24 at 
the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Cossette, asked about Abdul-Jabbar's abilities as a producer, said: "Kareem 
knows what it is he wants. There are 30 different ways to do a show like this, 
but he was very specific on the format, very creative. That's what the 
production business is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Productions has also made a videotape, "Kareem: Reflections From the 
Inside," which is available in video stores. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Crystal, the older brother of comedian Billy -- Richard is 43, Billy 40 
-- produced this film with Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
And it is excellent, showing a more human side to Abdul-Jabbar than publicly 
seen before, plus some outstanding footage from his playing career, going back 
to when he was a 6-foot-8 eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 9 recently had a one-hour feature on Abdul-Jabbar, called "Summer of 
42," which was very good, but the tape he did with Crystal is even better. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal and Abdul-Jabbar, who met through a mutual friend when both were in 
high school in the New York area, are close friends. 
</P>
<P>
After Abdul-Jabbar made a deal with CBS Fox Video, the distributor of the tape, 
he asked Crystal, a writer-producer, to work with him on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we got Kareem to be himself," Crystal said. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar said the film goes deeper than others because he felt comfortable 
working with Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
He said that is not to imply he does not get along with Ted Green, the producer 
of "Summer of 42," even though Green, who once covered the Lakers for The 
Times, was often critical of the Laker captain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's water under the bridge," Abdul-Jabbar said. "That has been forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
What next for Abdul-Jabbar? 
</P>
<P>
"For now, I'm concentrating on the playoffs," he said. "Then I'm going to take 
a couple of months off. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I'll have time to see what happens and where I fit into the 
business. I don't want to try and do everything at once." 
</P>
<P>
What's new at Channel 2: Beginning this weekend, there will be a new set and a 
new name for the Sunday night sports wrap-up show at Channel 2, but the host 
will be the same. 
</P>
<P>
The 11:15-11:45 p.m. sports segment, to be called simply "The Keith Olbermann 
Show," will be done on a set that resembles Olbermann's office, filled with 
sports memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the changes will also change Olbermann's luck. He's had a tough go the 
past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
First, he got some heat for reporting that Al Davis was negotiating to move the 
Raiders to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Lukenbill, managing general partner of basketball's Sacramento Kings, 
called the report, in which Olbermann used unidentified sources, "irresponsible 
journalism." 
</P>
<P>
The story, however, is still alive. The Sacramento Bee, also quoting 
unspecified sources, reported Thursday that Lukenbill was heading a group 
continuing negotiations with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the Daily News' Paola Boivin about doing stories using unidentified 
sources, Olbermann was quoted as saying: "I don't like to do them. I certainly 
don't do them for the glory that's supposedly involved. The principal purpose 
is that people need to know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Roah, a sportscaster who used to work with Olbermann at Channel 5, has a 
different opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"While I've worked with a lot of big egos in this business, I don't think I've 
worked with anyone who is more concerned about glory for himself than Keith," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Olbermann also was supposed to do a three-part series on sports memorabilia. It 
was cut to a single segment. 
</P>
<P>
"One part was enough," said Erik Sorenson, Channel 2 news director. 
</P>
<P>
And finally a contest to come up with a name for the Sunday night show was 
nixed. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sorenson: "Although we had some interesting names submitted, such as Keith 
Olbermann Sports-o-Rama and Keith Olbermann Sports Emporium, we decided to keep 
it simple and go with 'The Keith Olbermann Show.' " 
</P>
<P>
What's new at NBC: The one person at NBC Sports who figured to have job 
security was executive producer Michael Weisman. 
</P>
<P>
He was bright, creative, willing to take chances, liked by staff members and 
reporters, and he had won all kinds of awards, which most television types 
think is important. 
</P>
<P>
But Weisman, 39, was fired this week and replaced by Terry O'Neil, also 39, 
even though Weisman had 2 1/2 years left on his $600,000-a-year contract, which 
NBC must pay. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Arthur Watson, also respected and liked, was replaced by Dick 
Ebersol as the president of NBC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
More changes are reportedly forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
It's a crazy business. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
HBO offers an attractive fight Saturday night when unbeaten lightweight 
champion Julio Cesar Chavez takes on super-lightweight champion Roger 
Mayweather at the Forum. The word super in this case is not a description, it 
denotes a weight class. If you're going to apply the word super to one of the 
fighters, it better fits Chavez, 60-0 with 50 knockouts and considered by many 
as the best boxer, pound-for-pound, in the world. Mayweather is 34-5, and one 
of the losses was to Chavez, who stopped him in the second round of their 1985 
fight. But Mayweather has improved since then and is 6-0 against Mexican 
opponents in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, from Culiacan, Mexico, recently toured East Los Angeles and HBO 
producer Rick Bernstein sent along a crew to film the visit. It will be shown 
as part of the prefight coverage, which begins at 7 p.m. Announcers Jim Lampley 
and Larry Merchant will work the fight without regular commentator Sugar Ray 
Leonard, who is busy preparing for his June 12 bout against Thomas Hearns. 
Former boxer Ruben Castillo of Bakersfield, who was knocked out by Chavez in 
April of 1981, will work the fight as a translator. . . . HBO will also provide 
a Spanish-enhanced telecast to cable companies in Spanish-speaking areas, and 
radio XPRS (1090) in San Diego will carry a Spanish-language broadcast of the 
fight. There will be no English-language radio coverage. 
</P>
<P>
After two weekends of National Basketball Assn. playoffs, the ratings on CBS 
are up from an average of 5.6 a year ago at this juncture to 6.2. CBS will 
televise doubleheaders both Saturday and Sunday, with games at 10 a.m. and 
12:30 p.m. both days. The Saturday games are New York-Chicago, with Dick 
Stockton and Hubie Brown, and Phoenix-Golden State, with Greg Gumbel and Quinn 
Buckner. The Sunday games are New York-Chicago, Game 4, with Stockton and 
Brown, and the Lakers at Seattle, with Verne Lundquist and Tom Heinsohn. 
</P>
<P>
The Tribute to Kareem ceremony held at the Forum April 23, before the Lakers' 
final regular-season game, finally was shown by Prime Ticket Wednesday night 
after the Lakers' victory over Seattle. Prime Ticket is tentatively planning to 
show it again next Tuesday at 6 p.m. before Game 5 of the Laker-Seattle series, 
provided there is a Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda and Don Drysdale will be Bob Costas' guests on "Costas Coast to 
Coast" on KFI Sunday night at 6. . . . Prime Ticket and GGP Sports of San 
Francisco have entered into a production deal in which GGP will provide such 
shows as "This Week in the Pac-10" and "Pac-10 Today" during the college 
football season.

OLYMPIC CHAMPION EVANS DECIDES TO ATTEND STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Evans, who won three gold medals in swimming at the 1988 Seoul Olympic 
Games, said Thursday that she has signed a letter of intent to attend Stanford 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a senior at Placentia El Dorado High School, has been besieged by 
recruiters in recent weeks. She said she chose Stanford for its academics and 
its strong swim program. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal won the 1989 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's swim 
championship. Stanford also took the title in 1983 and has never finished lower 
than third since 1977. Stanford's new coach is Richard Quick, who was the U.S. 
Olympic swim coach in the Games last fall. Quick was formerly the women's swim 
coach at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a hard time deciding," Evans said. "Texas, Florida and Stanford all have 
good programs. But I really like the girls on the team at Stanford. I liked the 
school and I can get a good education." 
</P>
<P>
Evans said she plans to major in communications, adding: "I like working with 
people and would like to do something in broadcasting." 
</P>
<P>
She also wants to swim in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Evans holds world records in the 400-meter individual medley, 400 freestyle and 
800 freestyle. She won gold medals in all three events at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Her victories in Seoul brought numerous endorsement offers. However, Evans said 
that she turned down the offers to maintain her amateur standing. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it was tempting, but I've always wanted to swim in college," Evans 
said. "I didn't want to forfeit my education. I'm 17; I want to be a kid for a 
while longer." 
</P>
<P>
Evans began gaining attention in 1986 with two bronze medals in the Goodwill 
Games at Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Her small stature (5 feet 4 inches, less than 100 pounds) and unorthodox style 
of swimming, which El Dorado Coach Tom Milich has likened to a Cuisinart, made 
her unique in the swimming world. Evans said she takes 52 strokes of freestyle 
per 50-meter pool. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Swimming Open in 1987, Evans set world records in the 400 freestyle 
(4 minutes 5.45 seconds), 800 freestyle (8:24.71 seconds) and 400 individual 
medley (4:39.75). She later lowered her time in the 400 freestyle to 4:03.85. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first female swimmer to hold three world records at one time since 
Debbie Meyer held four in 1968. The last female swimmer to hold three was 
Kornelia Ender of East Germany in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her success, Evans continued to swim for her high school team. Last 
year, she set national high school records in the 500-yard freestyle (4:37.30) 
and 200 individual medley (2:00.72). 
</P>
<P>
She is favored to win those events again Saturday in the Southern Section 3-A 
finals at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said her college choice was the hardest decision she has ever made. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents said they would support whatever decision I made," she said. "I 
weighed the pros and cons and picked Stanford. I'm really happy with the 
decision and think it's for the best."

KEN HOWELL GETS A FRESH START WITH THE PHILLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representing the Philadelphia Phillies at a banquet in Delaware last winter, 
Ken Howell said he noted the presence of Roland Hemond, the Baltimore Orioles' 
general manager, as he told the audience: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank Roland Hemond for making me a member of the Baltimore Orioles 
for four days, but I'd like to be reimbursed for the $5 I spent on an Oriole 
cap." 
</P>
<P>
Howell laughed in recollection. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kidding, but Roland must have thought I was serious," he said. "He wrote 
out a check right there and handed it to me. The audience broke up." 
</P>
<P>
The check has never been cashed, Howell said. He still has it, a souvenir of 
his short-lived career with the Orioles, who sent Eddie Murray to the Dodgers 
for Howell, Brian Holton and Juan Bell during the December baseball meetings in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Howell had no more tried on his new cap when the Orioles traded him to the 
Phillies for left fielder Phil Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got the call saying I had been traded to the Phillies, I thought it was 
a practical joke," Howell said. "I had no idea what was happening. I mean, I 
couldn't believe the Orioles would trade for me and then trade me right away." 
</P>
<P>
He has come to grips with it now and said he couldn't be happier. He is a 
regular in the Phillies' rotation, a role he doesn't believe the Dodgers ever 
would have given him. The Dodgers, in fact, will check out his progress in 
tonight's opener of a three-game series here. 
</P>
<P>
Howell will take a 3-1 record and a 4.59 earned-run average into his sixth 
start for the pitching-poor Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to every fifth day, no matter who the opposition is," he said. 
"If I was still with the Dodgers, I'd be at Albuquerque, pitching behind Ramon 
Martinez. I wouldn't be next in line (to go up), Ramon would. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd seen that situation before and it's nice to be somewhere where I don't 
have to climb over someone. The Phillies needed a pitcher and I'm getting a 
chance to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
At 28, after seven seasons on the Dodger shuttle, always on trial, first as a 
reliever and then a starter, Howell is getting his chance in an atmosphere 
relatively free of pressure, though not of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orioles gave up Eddie Murray and the Phillies gave up Phil Bradley," 
Howell said. "Suddenly people are asking, 'Who's Ken Howell?' especially since 
I spent so much of last year in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm in a position where I've got to perform, where I've got to put some 
numbers on the board, but it's fun. This is a team that can score a lot of runs 
and has one of the best closers (Steve Bedrosian) in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is that if I can keep us within a run or two for seven innings, we 
have a chance to win. I'm trying to throw strikes, cut down on walks and not 
put too much pressure on myself by thinking about much else. 
</P>
<P>
"People here seem to realize the club is rebuilding. We're trying to improve on 
last year (when the Phillies lost 96 games) and take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia fans, of course, take their hoagies and their Phillies seriously. 
Patience has never been their strong suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that," Howell said. "But I don't think they're any different than 
the fans in L.A., except they don't leave in the seventh inning to beat the 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Howell began his final season with the Dodgers recovering from shoulder 
surgery, first at Bakersfield, then Albuquerque. He was recalled June 16, hit 
hard as the starter against Atlanta that night, sprained his right knee in a 
plate collision with Dale Murphy and was sent back to Albuquerque, where he 
finished the season with a 10-1 record and the knowledge he would probably be 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have anything more to prove to the Dodgers," Howell said. "I was 
making $200,000 at the time and I think they felt that if they didn't have a 
place for me, they'd get me to someone who did. 
</P>
<P>
"I had good times with the Dodgers and no regrets or bitterness about any of 
it. It's just that I have a chance here that I didn't have there. I mean, 
you've got Murray happy to be in L.A., Bradley happy to be in Baltimore and I'm 
happy to be here. 
</P>
<P>
"And if you feel good, it has a lot to do with how you perform."

QUISENBERRY HOLDS OFF PADRES FOR FIRST NL SAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, it was Quiz time. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Quisenberry, fourth on baseball's all-time list for saves, got his first in 
the National League Thursday at St. Louis by securing the Cardinals' 6-5 
victory over the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time I've got a chance to pitch with the game on the line and the lead, it 
reminds me of a thousand other times," Quisenberry said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dayley came on after Jose DeLeon walked Randy Ready to start the Padre 
eighth. After Bip Roberts tripled to make the score 6-4, Quisenberry was 
summoned to face Carmelo Martinez, who blooped a double to right field. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Nelson grounded a single to right, but Tom Brunansky threw out Martinez at 
home. Jose Oquendo then made a diving stop near second base and forced out 
Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Quisenberry got his 239th save with a perfect ninth. The other 238 came with 
the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
DeLeon (6-2) and San Diego's Eric Show (4-4) each allowed three runs in the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Show walked Thompson with the bases loaded in the third to break the tie, and 
Brunansky followed with a sacrifice fly. Thompson doubled home a run in the 
fifth to make the score 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals announced that Herzog has signed a two-year contract extension 
through the 1992 season, and General Manager Dal Maxvill has signed a two-year 
extension through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 8, Philadelphia 3 -- Tom Glavine won his fifth game without a defeat, 
and Lonnie Smith hit a home run and scored three times as the Braves ran their 
winning streak to seven games by beating the Phillies at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine, 7-17 last year, gave up eight hits en route to his fourth complete 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Treadway led off the Atlanta sixth with a triple and scored on Ron Gant's 
sacrifice fly to break a 3-3 tie. Smith followed with his fifth homer. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 6, Oakland 2 -- Craig Worthington doubled home two runs to break a 
1-1 tie in the fourth inning at Baltimore as the Orioles handed the Athletics' 
Dave Stewart his first loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ballard (6-1) joined Stewart (6-1) as the American League's only six-game 
winners by giving up nine hits in seven innings. Gregg Olson pitched the final 
two innings. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart gave up six runs and 12 hits, a career high, in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Former A's catcher Mickey Tettleton drove in three runs with a home run and a 
two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Terry Steinbach went 0 for 3, ending his 15-game hitting streak -- 
which had tied him for longest in the majors this season. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Kansas City 3 -- Nolan Ryan pitched a five-hitter and struck out 11 
batters, and Pete Incaviglia drove in four runs to lead the Rangers past the 
Royals at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan (4-2) improved his career record against the Royals to 21-10. It was the 
185th time in his career and the 12th time against Kansas City that he had 
fanned at least 10 batters. He leads the major leagues with 64 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gubicza (2-3) lost his fourth consecutive decision to the Rangers at 
Royals Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Incaviglia hit a two-run triple in the second and a two-run single in the 
sixth.

Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White said Thursday that he has agreed in 
principle to sign a new contract but won't do so until after the conclusion of 
the club's "quarterback school." 
</P>
<P>
The training session for Cowboy quarterbacks, including Troy Aikman, the No. 1 
draft choice from UCLA, begins Monday and runs through June 2. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there has been no progress in negotiations with unsigned quarterback 
Steve Pelluer, according to new Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
White, who negotiated for himself, told the Dallas Times Herald that reports he 
will accept a contract with a base salary of less than $300,000 and lucrative 
performance incentives were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are good businessmen," White said of the Cowboys' new management. 
"They are being fair." 
</P>
<P>
White had been scheduled to earn $605,000 during what was to be his option year 
in 1989.

11 CITY BASEBALL COACHES SAY THEY'D HONOR PICKET LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A group of City Section baseball coaches said Thursday that they would honor 
picket lines and boycott the conclusion of the regular season next week if 
schoolteachers carry out a proposed strike against the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
The group of 11 coaches also joined United Teachers-Los Angeles in criticizing 
the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn., which has recommended that coaches continue 
to supervise their teams even if they participate in the strike set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The association's position was unanimously approved by 19 representatives from 
the City Section's 49 high schools at an emergency meeting Wednesday at Belmont 
High. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation conforms to a directive issued this week by the district, 
which has reversed its field since the last strike 19 years ago, when coaches 
who participated in the walkout were forced to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches' association announced its recommendation at the same time the 
baseball coaches struck their position. After a seeding meeting for the City 
4-A Division playoffs, the coaches agreed to honor picket lines. They also said 
that they will meet Monday to discuss plans for the playoffs if a strike is not 
averted. Baseball playoffs begin May 24. JOHN LYNCH

FINAL-HOLE BIRDIE GIVES ZOELLER THE LEAD OVER STEWART, COUPLES

Fuzzy Zoeller birdied the final hole Thursday for an opening-round 69 that gave 
him a one-stroke lead in the Memorial golf tournament at Dublin, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Zoeller, who has just one top-10 finish in 10 tournaments this year, almost 
holed an eight-iron from 144 yards out on the par-four closing hole. He then 
made a four-inch putt to move ahead of Payne Stewart and Fred Couples. 
</P>
<P>
Another shot back at 71 were David Edwards, Bob Tway, Morris Hatalsky, Kenny 
Knox, Mark Wiebe, Jim Carter, Brad Bryant, Corey Pavin and Keith Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, who founded the tournament and has won it twice, led a long list 
of players at par 72. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny skies and blustery winds helped dry the Muirfield Village course after 
four days of rain had left it soft and saturated. 
</P>
<P>
Zoeller, whose best finish at the Memorial was third 11 years ago, made the 
turn at even par but had five birdies and a double-bogey on the back side. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who won the Heritage tournament a month ago, was three-under at the 
turn but overcame three bogeys on the back nine to finish at two-under. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Curtis Strange struggled to a 78, while Greg Norman finished 
at 75 along with Masters champion Nick Faldo. Former Masters and British Open 
champion Sandy Lyle shot a 76.

Clipper owner Donald T. Sterling said Thursday that North Carolina State Coach 
Jim Valvano will be in Los Angeles for an interview next Wednesday, but Valvano 
denied it. 
</P>
<P>
While saying that Don Casey, Clipper interim coach since Jan. 19, is the 
leading candidate to become head coach, Sterling said Art Kaminsky, Valvano's 
agent, called Wednesday and asked for a meeting. Valvano, in Rocky Mount, N.C., 
to address a North Carolina State booster club, said that he has no plans to 
meet with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is news to me," Valvano told the News and Observer of Raleigh, N.C. "I'm 
not planning on being out there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jay Grossman, an assistant to Kaminsky: "There has been no scheduled 
meeting at this point." 
</P>
<P>
To which Sterling said: "I'm confirming that we spoke (with Kaminsky) and that 
there is a meeting scheduled. I have no idea why he would say that." SCOTT

Lloyd Daniels, a star basketball prospect whose career was sidetracked by drug 
and alcohol abuse, was critically wounded in a shooting that New York police 
said may have been drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, 22, was in stable condition after surgery. He was shot in the chest 
and neck, according to a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8 Daniels attended four high schools in three states without 
graduating, enrolled in junior college at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, 
Calif., and went on to Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
He was dismissed from UNLV after being arrested on charges that he tried to buy 
cocaine from an undercover police officer. Daniels pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor and entered a drug rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Assn. but was 
suspended because of rumored drug use. He went to the New Zealand Basketball 
Federation but was dismissed last year for missing practice and excessive 
drinking.

Eric Vanderarden of Belgium continued his surge toward the lead, winning two 
stages of the Tour de Trump bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderaerden, who began the day in third place, 2:09 behind overall leader Dag 
Otto Lauritzen, rode conservatively through much of the 97-mile Charlottesville 
to Richmond Road Race before using his teammates' drafting help to win the 
sixth stage in 3 hours 21 minutes 29 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderaerden also won the night nine-mile Richmond Individual Time Trial in 
18:47 and trails Lauritzen, a former Norwegian police officer and military 
officer, by one minute with three stages left. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's too much to make up," said Vanderaerden, who has gained nearly 
three minutes on the leader in the last five days with four victories and one 
second-place finish. "But I must think positive and maybe I can catch him." 
</P>
<P>
Conserving energy, Vanderaerden rode in the back of the main field and then 
followed several of his teammates on the second of two 3.5-mile laps in the 
financial district of the state capital. As he had done three previous times, 
Vanderaerden outsprinted the field for the win. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Zanoli of the Netherlands finished second in the road race, and Soviet 
amateur Viatcheslav Ekimov was third. In the time trial, Ekimov was second in 
18:54, followed by Kent Bostick of Corrales, N.M, in 18:56.

The Nevada Supreme Court was asked by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. to 
lift an injunction that has prevented the suspension of Jerry Tarkanian, 
basketball coach at Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The motion was signed by NCAA attorney Jim Beasley and mailed to the court. 
Last December, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, in the NCAA's favor against 
Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
The motion requests that the Nevada high court lift a district court injunction 
that prevents the suspension of Tarkanian, charged with numerous rule 
violations in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Cliff Young has said that Tarkanian's attorneys will have a 
chance to review the motion before any ruling is made. 
</P>
<P>
If the injunction is wiped out, the NCAA can ask UNLV to order Tarkanian's 
suspension for two years.

ISAAC ASIMOV: THE EARTH'S 500,000-MILE NEAR MISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Isaac Asimov 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 23, 1989, Earth had another close call. A small asteroid, about half a 
mile across, whizzed past at a distance of about 500,000 miles, about twice the 
distance from the Earth to the moon. That sounds like a safe distance, of 
course, and "a miss is as good as a mile," they say. 
</P>
<P>
However, that rock is following an orbit that nearly crosses Earth's and every 
once in a while (a fairly long while), Earth and asteroid reach the crossing 
point at the same time and it gives us one of these close-call whizz-bys. 
</P>
<P>
We might argue that 500,000 miles, or possibly a little closer, may be as close 
as it can possibly come if the orbits stay as they are, but they won't. Earth 
is a massive body and its orbit is quite stable, but the asteroid is a tiny 
thing in comparison and it is subject to the pull of Earth and moon and Mars 
and Venus as it moves so that its orbit is constantly shifting a little. 
</P>
<P>
Its orbit may shift so as to carry it farther from Earth, or possibly closer. 
To be sure, there is much more room away from Earth than closer, so the chance 
of its moving into a collision course is very small, but it's not zero. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that this asteroid is not the only one, either. In 1937, an 
asteroid that astronomers named Hermes passed within 200,000 miles of Earth, 
and it was larger than this one that just missed us. It may have been a mile 
across. 
</P>
<P>
And on Aug. 10, 1972, a small object, only 40 feet across, perhaps, actually 
passed Earth at a distance of only 30 miles above the surface of southern 
Montana -- and whizzed on. It had passed through our stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Some astronomers think there may be at least a hundred objects that are half a 
mile or more across and that have orbits that send them skimming by Earth. And 
there may be thousands that are a few dozen feet across. Obviously the chance 
that perhaps one out of all these will finally strike Earth is far greater than 
the chance that a particular one, like the one that just missed us, will do so. 
</P>
<P>
Even a comparatively small object like the one that missed southern Montana 
could do fearful damage if it struck. If it hit land, it would gouge a sizable 
crater. After all, these projectiles can be moving 20 miles a second as they 
hit Earth. 
</P>
<P>
An object half a mile across, like the one that just missed us, would hit with 
the force of 20 billion tons of TNT. If it struck New York, it would 
undoubtedly wipe out the entire city and kill millions of people in an instant. 
If it struck the ocean it might be even worse, for the water in the ocean would 
slosh tremendously and huge "tidal waves," mountains of water hundreds of feet 
high, would crash onto neighboring shores and drown tens of millions. 
</P>
<P>
If the object is bigger still, it might puncture Earth's crust, set off 
volcanic action, start worldwide forest fires, drown half the continents and 
cast so much dust up into the stratosphere as to cut off sunlight for a long 
period. Such a huge strike might kill most or all of life and, indeed, such a 
huge strike is thought by many to have wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lesser collisions have happened recently. In Arizona, there is a crater 
four-fifths of a mile across and 600 feet deep that formed perhaps 50,000 years 
ago as a result of a collision. It probably didn't kill anyone because human 
beings had not reached the Americas yet. In 1908, a much smaller strike in 
central Siberia knocked down every tree for 20 miles around, but it was a 
desolate, uninhabited region and nobody was killed. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there is no record in historic times of any human being being killed 
by a meteoric strike -- but we can't stay that lucky forever. 
</P>
<P>
What can we do about it? 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago I wrote an essay that appeared in the August, 1959, issue of 
Space Age called "Big Game Hunting in Space." In it, I advocated the 
establishment (once we had the ability to do so) of a space sentinel that would 
watch for any nearby object more than a few feet wide that might be 
approaching. It might then be blown up by a hydrogen bomb planted in its path, 
or by something more advanced. (It would be a "Star Wars" defense aimed at 
asteroids rather than at enemy missiles.) 
</P>
<P>
As far as I know, I was the first to suggest this, but since than, astronomers 
have discussed the problem very seriously. After all, there are estimates that 
a "city-busting" strike might happen, on the average, once in 50,000 years, and 
it's been that long since the Arizona crater. We might be due, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if we smash up a small asteroid, the rubble will continue in its 
orbit, perhaps, but then if that does strike the Earth, each individual bit 
can't do much damage. Instead of having a huge crater gouged out, we'll be 
treated to a brilliant meteor display as the small pieces burn up in the air, 
or land as small rocks.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: LESSONS FROM A TALE OF MUD GONE DRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I close my eyes at night, no matter where I am, my mind often drifts back 
many years to the newly commissioned Calypso floating beneath a Mediterranean 
sky. The ship was my childhood home, though I never had a place reserved to me. 
Instead, I slept in a different bunk each night, sometimes in the open drawer 
of a locker, sometimes in my mother's bed, sometimes in my father's. Calypso 
was my childhood identity. 
</P>
<P>
I was lucky. My father's ship was my foundation, the beginning of my future. As 
Calypso sailed throughout the world, she came to embrace the philosophy that 
life on our planet is fragile and that its beauty, though ancient, is 
perishable. 
</P>
<P>
My father imparted to me the belief that we are not the owners of the world's 
resources, but its stewards. We are responsible for protecting what we have for 
those who will follow. 
</P>
<P>
Today I try to live by that compass, but as I travel I am struck by how 
infrequently adults keep future generations in mind. Across the globe, we see 
parents who seem to care little about the condition of the planet their 
children will inherit. 
</P>
<P>
We pollute the rivers and aquifers that will be our children's source of fresh 
water. We tamper with the ozone layer that would protect our children from 
dangerous solar rays. We set in motion what seems to be a dangerous warming of 
the Earth, putting our children at risk of drought and disaster. Unborn 
children cannot speak out. Nonetheless, we are accountable, even to generations 
we will not see. 
</P>
<P>
As far as I know, none of the most powerful nations on Earth has legal 
responsibility to protect the environment for future generations. But, 
interestingly, the tiny island nation of Papua New Guinea has made such an 
attempt, having written its concern for its children into its very 
constitution. It states: "We declare . . . our natural resources and 
environment to be for the collective benefit of us all and to be replenished 
for the benefit of future generations." Each citizen is expected to behave with 
future citizens in mind. 
</P>
<P>
But words alone cannot prevent the greedy from preying on the unsuspecting. 
Resource exploitation means quick money, and quick money is blind to tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the now classic tale of Wezip Alolum, which has to do, quite simply, 
with mud. Wezip Alolum, a member of Jobto village in the Papua province of 
Madang, owned forested land on which was a mud pit. For generations, his family 
earned its living by exchanging balls of mud and mud-clay pots for food. The 
mud pit had been his inheritance, passed on to him intact by his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
When foreign developers sought permission to log on the family land, Wezip 
Alolum was reluctant. "You won't need mud anymore," he was told, "now you will 
have money." He finally agreed. 
</P>
<P>
However, he had not understood that the company intended to fell or burn every 
tree, leaving none to reseed. It was beyond him that the company would treat 
the land without respect for its future. Soon not only were the trees gone, but 
with the resulting erosion, even the mud pit was spoiled. Its clay was ruined, 
too dry to work. Wezip Alolum also soon ran out of money. Without mud, for the 
first time in the history of his family he was poor. 
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the forestry company reimburse him for his loss of the pit. 
But who would pay compensation for mud? Yet to Wezip Alolum the mud pit 
amounted to inherited capital from those who came before him. He had been both 
owner and caretaker. Now he had nothing to leave his children and the cycle of 
his family had been broken. 
</P>
<P>
Wezip Alolum was a victim of a shortsighted exchange of resources for cash. 
</P>
<P>
But what of us? In squandering natural resources, are we not behaving 
recklessly toward our children? When they realize we have bequeathed them a 
host of environmental perils, a greatly depleted inventory of resources, what 
will they think of us, despite our drive to buy them the best we can afford? 
</P>
<P>
Calypso was more than a boyhood gift. She remains a legacy to me, a reminder of 
continuity and the ideal of inheritance combined with responsibility. She is a 
living document, my constitution for tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, if we change our ways, a global constitution will someday protect our 
air, water, forests and wildlife -- our natural legacy -- for future 
generations. Perhaps our children will write it.

Through the window of C. David Heymann's 14th-floor apartment on Central Park 
West, the tender green leaves of spring sag under the weight of a heavy rain. 
On the other side of the park's verdant expanse, on fashionable Fifth Avenue, 
lives a woman named Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis likes it or not, C. David Heymann is the man 
whose name is being linked these days with that of the Most Famous Woman in the 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Heymann is the author of one of the spring's hottest books, "A Woman Named 
Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, $21.95), a sizzling 631-page unauthorized biography of 
the former First Lady, who will turn 60 in July. 
</P>
<P>
Magazines, newspapers and television have been tripping over one another in a 
rush to get the book's most titillating tidbits into print. It has been a 
veritable Jackie bonanza, a tabloid-lover's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie and J.F.K. shot up with amphetamines by a "Dr. Feelgood." . . . A 
lovesick Marilyn phones Jackie at the White House. . . . Womanizing J.F.K. beds 
just about anything that moves. . . . Jackie's coldness makes Onassis want a 
divorce. . . . Jackie goes on shop-till-you-drop binges. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And true to her very private form, Jackie, through her spokeswoman Nancy 
Tuckerman, has had a discreet "no comment" on this latest tell-all tome. 
</P>
<P>
Why our endless fascination with a woman whom Heymann, after four years of 
research and interviews with 825 sources, still calls "a mystery, a 
hieroglyphic, a question mark"? 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie, probably because she's never spoken in her own behalf, has remained a 
subject of tremendous interest to Americans and to people all over the world," 
says Heymann, 44, who hit the best-seller lists a few years ago with "Poor 
Little Rich Girl," a biography of Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
If Jackie has maintained a regal silence, plenty of people -- from the late 
Christina Onassis to the public relations director of Maxim's -- talked to 
Heymann and his crew of researchers. And while Heymann refused to quote anyone 
anonymously, three of his main sources -- Christina Onassis, Peter Lawford and 
Truman Capote -- are dead. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the wonders of this century is that we have a tape recorder, and 
they're on tape," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Files Helped 
</P>
<P>
And thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, Heymann made extensive use of 
CIA, FBI, Secret Service and the White House social files. The Secret Service 
files chart President Kennedy's insatiable appetite for women, and Heymann's 
account of the White House years reads like "Fanny Hill." 
</P>
<P>
"I think John F. Kennedy, in retrospect, is a disgrace," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
If Kennedy and the image of Camelot emerge tattered and tarnished, Aristotle 
Onassis comes out smelling like a comparative rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he made some genuine efforts to have a fulfilling marriage. He grew 
close at least to John Jr.," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
Heymann claims to have only respect for the way Jackie Onassis has dealt with 
adversity and tragedy in her life and for her courage in returning to work late 
in life as a book editor. 
</P>
<P>
"She's regal; she's elegant as ever; she is an everlasting mystery," he says. 
"I think she's elevated the human spirit in this country. If there were more 
Jackie Kennedys around, this would be a better place in which to live. I find 
her to be a very noble person." 
</P>
<P>
Readers are likely to come away from "A Woman Named Jackie" with mixed emotions 
-- moved by her devastation at the loss of John F. Kennedy, put off by her 
apparent coldness and determination to live in the lap of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"She's human. She does have frailties, and money is her Achilles' heel," 
Heymann says. "But compare her to the Duchess of Windsor, for example, who put 
herself before England. The poor guy (Edward VIII) had to step off the throne. 
Here's a woman who, despite her husband's carrying on, put the country before 
herself and supported John F. Kennedy, who lent herself to making the White 
House a splendid place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woman of Many Faces 
</P>
<P>
Although Heymann insists that his portrait of Jackie is positive, his book 
unflinchingly quotes those who see her variously as avaricious, as icy, as less 
intelligent than she has been purported to be. 
</P>
<P>
Readers learn that Christina Onassis loathed the glamorous woman who married 
her wealthy father. They read that Jackie glared icily at JFK when he and Angie 
Dickinson slipped away for an apparent tryst on Inauguration Night. They are 
told that Jackie was drinking heavily when she recounted the horrors of her 
husband's assassination to author William Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
Are there limits to what the public has a right -- or even a desire -- to know? 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are interested in people," Heymann says. "We're all animals on 
this Earth. We're all at the same watering hole and we look at each other. 
That's basically what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Heymann began his writing career as a poet and literary biographer. "Ezra 
Pound" and "American Aristocracy: The Lives and Times of James Russell, Amy and 
Robert Lowell" were nominated for Pulitzer Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why the Tabloid Books? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I couldn't continue to write literary biography and support a 
family. I don't mean to suggest I write just for money, but a person does have 
to make a living," Heymann says in explaining why he has moved on to books like 
"A Woman Named Jackie" and "Poor Little Rich Girl." 
</P>
<P>
The Barbara Hutton biography, originally published by Random House in 1983, was 
recalled, according to Heymann, because of an error about the date of birth of 
a Hutton physician, which left open the possibility of a lawsuit. The physician 
was charged with overmedicating the heiress. Random House would not republish 
the book; Lyle Stuart then picked up the rights, and the book went on to become 
a best seller and a TV miniseries. Heymann says that the incident does not 
impugn his integrity or credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Heymann daunted by his own admission at the end of 631 pages that the 
real Jackie remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the book is about in a sense; it's a search for the real Jackie 
Kennedy. This is a woman who is simply unknowable, who probably doesn't even 
know herself," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
But with bookstore orders upping the in-print total of "A Woman Named Jackie" 
to 450,000 copies just a week after publication, it is clear that inquiring 
minds will take what they can get.

ON YOUR OWN: DEALING WITH THE IDEALIZATION OF LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When an intense feeling of romantic love very rapidly fades and disappears, it 
usually provokes hurt, disillusionment and puzzlement for both partners in the 
relationship. This is reflected in the letters I have received from two 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
A 34-year-old businessman writes: 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, when I would repeatedly fall madly in and out of love, I 
understood it to be part of being a teen-ager -- and of mistaking lust for 
love. But now the same thing has happened to me three different times in the 
last 10 years, and I feel doomed never to be able to sustain a loving feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"In all three instances, soon after I met the woman I was drawn to her, wanted 
to be with her all the time and delighted in everything about her. I would 
pursue her, and she almost couldn't help but respond to my ardent romancing. I 
sincerely felt I wanted to spend my life with her, and I told her so. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, after only a few months, the feeling would begin to fade. I would just 
stop looking forward to being with her, and lots of little things would bother 
me. I would try desperately to make the feeling come back, but it was like 
trying to remember a dream that's getting away from you. I don't understand why 
this happens. Do I fall in love too hard? Am I unrealistic to expect the 
feeling to last?" 
</P>
<P>
And a 27-year-old female fashion designer writes: 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago at this time, I was the happiest woman in the world. I had met Dave 
through my work, and I was almost instantly attracted to him. We flirted, but I 
felt I was more serious about it whereas he was playful. Then we began to go 
out, and we both fell deeply in love with each other. It couldn't have been 
more romantic and fulfilling. I liked everything about him -- his looks 
(particularly the sexy way he would narrow his eyes when he looked at me), the 
way he walked, his ideas, his jokes, even the way he held his cigarettes (and I 
hate smoking). 
</P>
<P>
"We are gradually moving toward marriage, only I find I'm not in love with him 
anymore, and I don't know why. He hasn't changed or done anything wrong. He's 
just as loving and funny as ever. But little things that never bothered me 
before are driving me crazy. The way he narrows his eyes now makes me want to 
say 'stop squinting.' And the way he holds his cigarette seems posed and phony. 
I can't figure out what happened and whether I should just hang in there hoping 
the feeling of love will come back." 
</P>
<P>
Many of us are familiar with the painful and mysterious disappearance of the 
feeling of romantic love. The psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Dr. Ethel Person 
has written a brilliant and enlightening book about the ups and downs of love 
called "Dreams of Love and Fateful Encounters" (W. W. Norton, 1988). She writes 
that passion inevitably has an element of idealization of the beloved. Some 
quality or combination of qualities bathes everything about the other person in 
a golden light. 
</P>
<P>
Person writes: "Because romantic love is based on idealization, which is an act 
of imaginative exaggeration, it is believed by skeptics that love will 
inevitably fade when confronted by . . . daily life. But the fate of 
idealization is variable. It may be preserved, diminished or utterly 
shattered." For the two letter writers the idealization tends to get "utterly 
shattered." 
</P>
<P>
They ask why. One possibility is that there was too much idealization at the 
beginning. This over-idealization, based primarily on the lover's need to find 
someone perfectly wonderful, blotted out too much reality. Nobody could live up 
to that perfect and unrealistic initial picture. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is put this way by Person: "Perhaps the easiest of all 
mechanisms to understand is best summed up by Groucho Marx's dictum: 'I 
wouldn't join any club that has me as a member.' If the lover has sufficiently 
low self-esteem, he regards anyone who truly loves him as, by definition, 
deficient, wanting in taste." So sometimes the feeling of love is lost when it 
is clear that the other person truly loves you back. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons for rapid and destructive de-idealization. Sometimes 
the fears of increasing emotional intimacy or moving toward commitment can 
cause a focus on the negative as a way of sabotaging the relationship. A person 
who wants his beloved to have no personal needs, but to live mainly to satisfy 
him, is disillusioned to discover that his beloved has interests, goals and 
desires that have nothing to do with him. His beloved may even have needs and 
expectations that he is supposed to meet. This can destroy the idealization, 
and then the feeling of romantic love evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that the initial idealization will diminish or change. But 
in cases where there is little understanding or expectation of this, the 
disappointment may be too great and the love feeling may die. 
</P>
<P>
Where some de-idealization is expected, it does not have to be destructive. The 
remaining idealization, combining with growing realistic intimacy, can make for 
a strong love relationship.

ON AGING: URGENT TIMES FOR EMERGENCY CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By UCLA/USC Long-Term Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Have you ever been to an emergency-medicine center? The answer for many of us 
is yes. We may have been there when we became ill after our doctor's office 
closed, when we broke a bone, were in a car accident or had a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us assume that when we need such care it will be available. Aren't 
emergency services a public obligation? 
</P>
<P>
It seems, however, that the public is not paying enough attention to the 
emergency-care system nationally, and serious cracks are now evident. Recent 
articles in the New York Times have spotlighted efforts to unclog overcrowded 
emercency centers. And reports in the Wall Street Journal have examined 
hospital "dumping" practices: Each year, 250,000 emergency patients are 
transferred to other hospitals for economic, not medical, reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times chronicled a series of permanent and temporary shutdowns 
of county emergency centers here. This sent paramedic units scurrying from one 
hospital to another. The cause is the inability of hospitals to absorb the 
costs of treating indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greater Effect on Elderly 
</P>
<P>
The strains on emergency-care facilities may jeopardize the health of anyone in 
need of urgent attention. One group that should be of special concern is older 
persons. The elderly represent a greater percentage of the population than at 
any time in history, and emergency centers are treating more older adults. The 
elderly are at risk because they often have multiple illnesses that interact 
and complicate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, older patients do not always seek care even when they have major 
symptoms. This delay may lead to late diagnosis and poor outcomes, according to 
Dr. Richard Besdine of the University of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Despite increasing numbers of elders, the system is not yet accommodating 
itself to this reality. Most emergency nurses, physicians and trauma 
technicians have little training in geriatrics. A survey of three 
paramedic-training centers in Los Angeles found that only one school offered 
any geriatric content -- a one-hour lecture. 
</P>
<P>
While there are myriad issues facing emergency medical care, one is how to 
better care for the growing number of older persons who will make use of the 
emergency system. 
</P>
<P>
Question: My wife and I retired and moved to an adults-only condominium in 
Florida in 1980. We have nothing against children, but prefer to live with 
adults who have similar interests. A rumor is sweeping our complex that a new 
law will allow families with young children to live here. Can you tell us about 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: In mid-March, legislation went into effect that may have an impact on 
communities such as yours. The new law, an amendment to the federal Fair 
Housing Act, seeks to prevent most communities from banning children. The law 
applies to rental units and condominiums, and is sure to raise legal challenges 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, children can be barred from a development under two 
provisions: if all the residents are 62 years of age or older, or if at least 
80% of the units are occupied by one person 55 years or older and the property 
has special facilities for older people. 
</P>
<P>
There is sure to be an increase in lawsuits over the legislation. Your 
homeowners association should explore the new law with a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My parents moved to Hilton Head, S.C., in 1976, when my father retired from 
a Massachusetts advertising firm. They made friends in their new-found home and 
pursued bridge and golf. 
</P>
<P>
My father died three years ago and my mother maintained her home and life style 
with dignity. Recently, she decided to return to Massachusetts and spend the 
rest of her life near her family. How will she readjust to living in the 
Northeast? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to data from the Census Bureau, researchers at the University of 
Florida believe that the migration of older people to Southern states may have 
peaked. In the period when your parents retired (between 1975 and 1980), more 
than 3% of all elderly Northeast residents who moved headed south. This fell to 
2% between 1980 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these people moved to take advantage of the relatively inexpensive cost 
of living the South offers and the agreeable climate. Many have grown old in 
their new homes, and states such as Florida consequently have a significant 
percentage of people 75 years and older. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, your mother is not alone in seeking to return. A number of 
people, particularly widows and widowers, choose to live near loved ones. Your 
mother sounds as if she is active, and you should anticipate no major traumas, 
particularly since this is her choice. 
</P>
<P>
We suggest your mother look for an apartment that has the advantages of modern 
technology, no stairs and a location near public transportation. 
</P>

GOODALL IN PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reading the article on Jane Goodall left me with a strange feeling 
("Spellbinding Advocate for Animals," by Beth Ann Krier, April 27). 
</P>
<P>
Most people know who Jane Goodall is, more people than saw "Gorillas in the 
Mist" I would venture to guess. National Geographic has always printed articles 
about her work and its importance to our understanding of human behavior in 
order that we perhaps could improve the quality of life on this planet. The 
writer of this article is using phrases and descriptions that are really in my 
opinion not at all appropriate to an article on Jane Goodall. "Seduces her 
audiences" . . . "her fine boned hand" . . . "slim and elegant with her gray 
hair pulled back in a simple ponytail . . . " these are fashion-like, artsy and 
shallow descriptions, not needed since there is a photograph on the front page. 
It really doesn't work for me in an article that should be informed and 
scientific.

NO BRIEF FOR SERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent article about Tony Serra, the defense attorney who smokes marijuana, 
served time in federal prison and abandons cars rather than pay parking tickets 
into the thousands of dollars, certainly adds new meaning to the term criminal 
lawyer ("Counterculture's Warrior Lawyer" by Robert Chow, May 3). 
</P>
<P>
This outstanding example of the California Bar was quoted as saying, "I'll try 
any case that comes along. If you kill a cop, I'll pay to take the case." Serra 
also "respects drug dealers because the heart of what they're trying to do is 
better their condition. They're trying in their fashion the only way they have 
of getting out of the ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, he overlooks those individuals of all colors and races who get an 
education and take ordinary jobs nowhere near as lucrative as selling drugs. I 
wonder if Serra's glib attitude would change if any of his five children became 
addicted as the result of contact with a pusher liberated by their father's 
efforts.

DRIVER GUILTY OF MURDER IN O.C. COPTER DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County jury decided that Vincent William Acosta knew the possible 
hazards when he led police on a frenzied car chase in 1987 and found him guilty 
Thursday of murdering three men in the collision of two pursuing police 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
While murder verdicts have been returned previously in the deaths of 
pedestrians and motorists killed on the ground during such chases, the Acosta 
jury broke new legal ground in finding that a blatantly reckless driver can be 
held criminally responsible for causing the deaths of airborne victims as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an awful precedent to find murder in a case like this," said a 
stunned Deputy Public Defender William G. Kelley, who tried to convince jurors 
that pilot error was to blame for the March 10, 1987, helicopter crash that 
left two Costa Mesa police officers and a third man dead. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel terrible. I feel awful. I don't think this was murder," Kelley said. "I 
don't think I will ever think this was a murder case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Seeming Disbelief 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Acosta shook his head slowly in seeming disbelief as the court 
clerk announced the three second-degree murder verdicts in a Santa Ana 
courtroom. Bowing his head, the defendant appeared near tears. Although his 
family had attended much of the weeklong trial, they were not in attendance for 
Thursday's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
But, his attorney said, "We knew when the jury came back in 4 hours what the 
verdict was going to be, so he was prepared for it." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta was convicted in the deaths of Costa Mesa Police Officers James D. 
Ketchum, 39, and John W. Libolt, 39, as well as Jeffrey A. Pollard, 29, a 
civilian observer from Tustin. Their helicopter, the Eagle, was in pursuit of 
Acosta above Irvine when it gave up the lead in the chase to another police 
helicopter from Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The three died when their helicopter hit the Newport Beach aircraft from 
behind, then crashed to the ground and erupted into flames. The second 
helicopter made a successful emergency landing, and the two Newport Beach 
officers aboard escaped serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, who did not take the stand in his own defense, could face 45 years to 
life in prison on the murder counts when he is sentenced June 30 by Superior 
Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald. Kelley said the verdict will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 jurors, leaving the courtroom in silence, refused to discuss the 
reasoning behind their verdict. Remarked one woman: "It was a hard decision. . 
. . That's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
"We followed the law," said several other jurors, all of whom declined to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Borris, commenting on the potential precedent set 
by the jury in its verdict, said: "The principle that a person has to be held 
accountable for the danger he causes has always existed in the law. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just nice to see now that we're finally moving into the 21st Century by 
realizing that police use both air and ground pursuit vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
The key elements of the case remained virtually undisputed over the course of 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
After stealing a car on the night of March 10, 1987, Acosta led police on a 
wild, 45-minute chase throughout the county that reached reported speeds of 90 
miles per hour. Driving without headlights, he ran through red lights, 
disobeyed traffic signs and at times drove on the wrong side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 minutes into the chase, the two police helicopters collided in the 
skies above Irvine, the first such crash in the state's history. Ketchum and 
Libolt had turned the chase over to a Newport Beach police helicopter, but then 
inexplicably doubled back and hit the second aircraft. Investigators have not 
been able to determine why the Costa Mesa helicopter changed course. 
</P>
<P>
In closing summations this week, the prosecutor and defense attorney offered 
jurors widely diverging legal theories about Acosta's responsibility in the 
mishap. 
</P>
<P>
State courts have generally ruled that a person can be held criminally 
responsible -- and convicted of murder -- for the deaths of pursuing police 
officers, pedestrians or other motorists that result from the driver's utter 
recklessness and disregard for safety. 
</P>
<P>
But the Acosta case is the first known in the state, and possibly the nation, 
to extend that theory to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley argued that that distinction alone means Acosta should have been cleared 
of murder charges because he could not reasonably be expected to foresee that 
his reckless driving could result in the deaths of the three men. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be stupid and absurd of me to stand here before you and argue that 
it's safe and OK to drive 90 miles an hour for 40 miles through Orange County," 
Kelley told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here to defend (Acosta's) character. And I'm not here to tell you he 
didn't do Borris maintained, however, that Acosta realized the dangers of 
driving at high speeds without headlights. Borris argued that Acosta decided to 
take the risk anyway, causing the crash and making him guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Had he pulled over when he heard the sirens and saw the red lights (at the 
outset of the pursuit), no one would have died that night," Borris said. "The 
most telling evidence that we have that Mr. Acosta performed the dangerous acts 
in conscious disregard for human life are his own words." 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Acosta reportedly told police, "Yeah, I knew it was dangerous 
-- to the bone" but said he continued his attempted escape anyway because he 
wanted to get home and feared going to jail, Borris said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley had sought to suppress Acosta's statements to police on the grounds that 
they were given unwillingly after investigators intimidated him into talking. 
But Judge Fitzgerald ruled that the statements could be heard by the jury. 
</P>
<P>
At Kelley's request, however, Fitzgerald did exclude from the trial portions of 
Acosta's statements in which he indicated that he had drunk beer and taken PCP, 
heroine and cocaine hours before the fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa helicopter was last seen flying in the opposite direction from 
the chase but -- for reasons still largely unknown -- apparently reversed 
direction and ended up ramming the Newport aircraft from behind. 
</P>
<P>
There was no radio contact before the collision, a point Kelley highlighted for 
jurors in blaming the accident on pilot error.

ONCE-FAVORITE SON OF ORANGE COUNTY GOP; 
</P>
<P>
EX-CANDIDATE'S PROBATION FOR FORGERY ENDS QUIETLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The final chapter in one of the most bizarre political cases in Orange County 
history comes to a close today as the 6-month probation of former Irvine City 
Councilman C. David Baker, once a shining prospect in the local Republican 
party, officially ends. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, 36, has performed in excess of 500 hours of community service for 
forging a $48,000 check during his failed bid for Congress last year. In 
September, Baker pleaded guilty to one count of felony forgery. But Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown later reduced the charge to a 
misdemeanor, ordering Baker to perform an unspecified amount of community 
service and placing him on probation. 
</P>
<P>
With the court's receipt of letters confirming that Baker had fulfilled his 
community service sentence, the probation order signed by the judge formally 
expires today. Baker was not disbarred as a result of his legal troubles, and 
he is reportedly considering several opportunities to practice law again in 
private industry. 
</P>
<P>
Since November, friends and associates say Baker has carried out his sentence 
with an almost religious zeal. He has served hot meals to the elderly, coached 
basketball at the Downey high school where he once starred as a student 
athlete, and worked as an adviser and business strategist for a nonprofit 
Irvine youth group. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker is described as happier and more outgoing these days, close 
friends say privately that it may take him years to overcome the events that 
last summer cost him his job with a prestigious law firm, a $400,000 lakeside 
home in Irvine and a promising political future. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure Dave has come a long way back from where he was a few months ago," said 
one longtime friend and political ally in Irvine. "But nobody will ever know 
how far gone Dave really was. At one point, he wasn't sure he wanted to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's life began to unravel in the final days of last June's Republican 
primary in the coveted 40th Congressional District. He was the early favorite 
in the race to replace six-term incumbent Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport 
Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Badham, who retired, endorsed Baker, as did a number of other prominent local 
GOP activists, giving the former UC Irvine basketball star a significant edge 
in the primary. A primary victory would have been tantamount to winning the 
seat because the district has one of the highest concentrations of Republicans 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the support of prominent Republicans and local officials, Baker found 
himself locked in an unexpectedly tight race as the primary drew to a close. 
With his campaign reportedly short of cash, Baker forged the signature of an 
Orange County Superior Court judge on a $48,000 check, which was written on the 
account of a local, nonprofit foundation that Baker headed at the time. Baker 
made the check out to himself, signing it with Judge David G. Sills' name, as 
well as his own. 
</P>
<P>
Baker stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written. 
</P>
<P>
When Sills and a handful of close friends discovered the forged checks just 
days before the election, Baker admitted himself for hospital care for 
depression and exhaustion. But his hospitalization was known to only a few, and 
it was not until after the primary, which he narrowly lost to Newport Beach 
attorney C. Christopher Cox, that news of the forged checks and Baker's 
hospital stay surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the ordeal, Baker has steadfastly declined to talk about the 
incident and its impact on his life. 
</P>
<P>
Baker could not be reached for comment this week about the end of his 
probation, and on Thursday, his attorney, Paul S. Meyer, declined to comment on 
his client or to discuss Baker's plans. 
</P>
<P>
What is known about Baker, based on court records and interviews with friends, 
is that he immersed himself in his community service work. He served hot 
lunches for Meals on Wheels in Irvine; helped coach the varsity basketball team 
at Warren High School in Downey, his alma mater; and worked for American Kids 
Sports Assn., the nonprofit arm of an Irvine-based youth sports organization 
founded by former Olympian Bob Mathias. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of his sentencing, Baker was allowed to choose his form of 
community service, but he could not be compensated for the work. 
</P>
<P>
At Kids Sports, Baker served as a legal adviser and business planner for the 
fledgling group, whose aim is to build self-esteem for children ages 5 to 12 
through sports. One of its major events is an international Olympic-style 
sporting competition for children scheduled for August in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Baker served as a liaison between the group and Mexican officials to help 
arrange the event, said Chuck Foster, an executive with Mathias' operations. 
Politically well connected, Baker also helped the group raise money, Foster 
said, introducing officials of Kids Sports to prominent community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to reach the right kind of people, to get them out and introduce 
them to Bob Mathias' programs," Foster said. "Dave proved to be a vital link." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was described by Foster as a "hard worker" who often labored through the 
night. "There were times we'd leave the office late at night, only to return 
the next morning and find Dave asleep in his chair or on his desk," Foster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster believes that Baker "plunged into his work" to forget his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime that you have gone through something that is difficult, immersing 
yourself in something you like is helpful," Foster said. "And Dave loves kids." 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason Baker apparently called his former basketball coach at 
Warren High last fall and asked if he could assist with the team. In a letter 
to Judge Brown, Baker said he wanted to return to Warren High because his own 
"character and values were forged" at the school. Baker was student body 
president and valedictorian at the school, as well as an All-American high 
school basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
The school's varsity basketball coach, Jan Young, said he believes that Baker 
came back to "see old friends and rediscover where he came from." Raised in a 
working-class family, Baker rose quickly professionally and financially, and in 
some ways, had taken his success for granted, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever Dave does in the future, I don't think he'll forget his roots this 
time," said Young, a coach at Warren since the early 1960s. "Dave got a lot 
awful fast. Maybe too fast." 
</P>
<P>
From the first day of practice in November through the playoffs in March, Young 
said Baker commuted almost daily to Downey to attend practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
"When Dave came to us, he was at the depths of his emotions," Young said. "But 
gradually, he came around. He found acceptance here. It was comfortable, like 
being at home." 
</P>
<P>
Since last fall, home for Baker, his wife and two sons has been a small 
condominium in Tustin. Despite reports during last year's campaign that the 
couple's marriage was strained, friends say that Baker and his wife are closer 
than ever. During the holidays, Young said, Baker wrote a song about his 
problems and regrets, and sang it for his wife, Patricia, on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
To pay for legal expenses and other personal debts, the couple were forced to 
sell their Irvine home near South Lake in Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
However, he still owes more than $90,000 to a number of political consultants, 
printers and pollsters who worked on his congressional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's plans are unclear. Last week, Foster said, Baker left Kids Sports, even 
though the group has talked with him about a full-time, paid position. Foster 
said Baker is considering several options, including some opportunities to 
practice law again. 
</P>
<P>
John Nakaoka, who managed Baker's congressional campaign, said, "The fact 
remains that Dave was a good attorney, who was good at bringing people together 
and reaching a settlement. Maybe he could serve as some sort of private 
arbitrator."

SENATE PASSES BILL TO OUTLAW GUARDS AT POLLING PLACES 
</P>

<P>
Reacting to an incident at the polls in Santa Ana last year, the state Senate 
on Thursday approved legislation that would make it a crime to post security 
guards at voting sites without the permission of election officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco), who authored the bill, said the measure 
was meant to prevent a repeat of what he termed the "disturbing episode" that 
occurred Nov. 8 when the Orange County Republican Party hired 20 uniformed 
guards to monitor Latinos as they went to the polls in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders said the guards were retained to watch for voter fraud after 
party officials heard persistent rumors that Democrats were going to bus 
non-citizens to the polls to vote illegally. GOP officials said the guards were 
given strict instructions not to interfere with voters and were pulled from 
their posts when the county registrar of voters complained that their actions 
might intimidate Latinos, even those legally registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would make it a felony or a misdemeanor, subject to the discretion of 
a judge, to hire or serve as a uniformed security guard within 100 feet of a 
polling place without written permission from the appropriate elections 
official. The measure also would prohibit anyone other than an elections 
official from receiving a ballot from a voter or asking a voter to turn over 
his or her ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was approved on a vote of 22 to 2, one vote more than the 
majority needed for passage in the 40-member Senate. The bill was sent to the 
Assembly, where its first stop will be the Elections, Reapportionment and 
Constitutional Amendments Committee. 
</P>
<P>
That panel includes Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), on whose behalf 
the party hired the security guards. Pringle defeated his Democratic opponent 
by fewer than 900 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Marks, chairman of the Senate Elections Committee, described his bill as "an 
attack upon the intimidating" of voters in Orange County. He said he would have 
introduced the bill even if the guards had been hired by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"No single party has a monopoly on stupidity," Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus, 
asked Marks to delay his bill until a federal lawsuit and a criminal 
investigation pending in Orange County are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a charged environment," Doolittle said. "Why don't you wait for that to 
be settled and then bring this up?" 
</P>
<P>
Marks, however, refused to postpone action on the bill, and it gained a 
majority with the help of three Republican votes, including that of Sen. John 
Seymour of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk), who represents part of Orange County, also 
voted for the bill. Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), Edward R. Royce 
(R-Anaheim) and William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
None of the Orange County senators spoke during the brief debate, but Bergeson, 
reached afterward, said she did not vote for the bill because, like Doolittle, 
she saw it as a purely partisan measure. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is just a way to embarrass Republicans," she said.

MAN WRITES COLUMNIST, SAYING HE KILLED HIS WIFE; POLICE FIND BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE and NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The body of a woman believed to be a 40-year-old Anaheim schoolteacher was 
found Thursday after her husband wrote a letter to a newspaper columnist saying 
that he had killed his wife and had made a list of 54 other people targeted for 
death, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the woman, found on a cul-de-sac in north Anaheim, was not 
immediately identified, but police said they suspected it was Gail M. 
Schoenecker, a teacher at Price Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believed that Schoenecker's husband, David L. Schoenecker, 48, 
had killed the woman, fled the state and then written the letter from a motel 
in Missoula, Mont. He was being sought on suspicion of murder. His car was 
found abandoned in Mineral County, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
The grisly series of events began Thursday when Bob Emmers, a columnist for the 
Orange County Register, received a letter postmarked from Missoula and written 
by Schoenecker, police said. In the letter, Schoenecker not only claimed to 
have killed his wife, but went on to threaten the others and to tell Emmers 
where her body could be found. Emmers gave the letter to Anaheim police and a 
check of the residence turned up the woman's body lying on a bed in the master 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Marc Hedgpeth, an Anaheim police spokesman, would not release details of 
the letter other than to say that its tone was threatening and that it made 
reference to a list. A list of 54 names was found in the suspect's house, and 
Hedgpeth said it was apparently the same list mentioned in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a list of people, 54 people he was threatening," Hedgpeth said. 
Asked if this was a hit list, Hedgpeth said that Schoenecker was "not specific, 
but his actions and his implications are that he's intending to kill them." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth would not release the names on the list but said that many of them 
were those of relatives and acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no threat to Emmers at all in the letter or the list," Hedgpeth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All the people named on the list live in Schoenecker's home state of Wisconsin, 
including at least one from Milwaukee, Hedgpeth said. Officers said they sent 
teletypes to police agencies "in a general area where we found people on the 
list." 
</P>
<P>
Emmers could not be reached for comment. Tim Kelly, the Register's managing 
editor, would say only that "Emmers received a letter from somebody who claimed 
he killed his wife. We immediately notified Anaheim police. We're cooperating 
fully with the Anaheim police." 
</P>
<P>
After finding the body, officers launched a multi-state search for Schoenecker, 
whom neighbors described as a quiet man who spent his spare time tending to his 
yard and doting over two small dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Al Baker of the Missoula police said that Schoenecker had been traced 
to a Travel Lodge Motel in Missoula last weekend. It was there, Baker said, 
that Schoenecker allegedly wrote the letter to Emmers on motel stationery. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I can gather, the letter was sent from the Travel Lodge," Baker 
said. "We went out there today and all the information we were able to gain was 
turned over to the Anaheim Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
A desk clerk at the motel confirmed that Schoenecker had registered under his 
own name and stayed there Saturday in a $28-a-night single room. 
</P>
<P>
"He left Sunday," the clerk said. "No one really remembers him. It's busy here 
on the weekend and there are many faces that go in and out." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said it was difficult to positively identify the body found at the 
house because it was in a state of decomposition. He said it appeared that the 
woman had been dead for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees of the Anaheim City School District, however, said they had been told 
late Thursday that Schoenecker had been killed and that police were looking for 
her husband. Neighbors in the area of two-story tract homes also said they had 
been told that Gail Schoenecker had been killed and that her husband had 
threatened to kill others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shocking," said Betty Patterson, an Anaheim school trustee. "I think she 
had only been teaching there 3 years. I heard she was good. It's an awful 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described the cul-de-sac area where the Schoeneckers lived as a quiet 
area where children played in the street and people were friendly. Police said 
that Schoenecker may have worked out of his home in some computer-related field 
and was often seen working in his yard during the day.

TRUCK BLAZE PROMPTS WARNINGS, EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents near Aliso Viejo were advised to stay in their homes with the windows 
shut and several businesses were evacuated Thursday when fire broke out on a 
flatbed truck carrying materials that officials feared were toxic. 
</P>
<P>
It was later determined that the materials -- biodegradable soap and another 
nontoxic cleaning solution -- were not hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department officials temporarily closed the southbound exit 
of Interstate 5 at Crown Valley Parkway and evacuated workers at businesses 
near the intersection of the parkway and Forbes Road at about 11 a.m. Thursday 
when the unmarked containers on the truck caught fire, Fire Department 
spokesman John Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began as an electrical fire in the truck's cab but eventually spread 
to the back of the truck and ignited the containers, Hamilton said. The driver, 
whose name was not immediately available, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the area were told to stay in their homes with their windows shut 
until the fire was extinguished, which took less than 10 minutes, Hamilton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a residual cloud remained, and officials were not immediately certain 
if the containers' contents were hazardous. Later testing proved that they were 
not, Hamilton said.

WOUNDED DEPUTY GOES HOME FROM HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Ripple, the deputy wounded in the Monday morning shoot-out with a 
suspected car thief in the Nellie Gail Ranch area of Laguna Hills was 
discharged from Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center on Thursday where he 
had been treated for a minor head injury. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old sheriff's deputy was hospitalized after a bullet grazed his 
forehead Monday in the gun battle between deputies and 25-year-old Matthew G. 
Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, a fugitive wanted in Nevada for parole violation, led officers on a 
5-mile chase from Mission Viejo ending in the gunfire on a small residential 
street. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was shot in the chest, and a second bullet grazed his forehead. He 
was listed in satisfactory condition Thursday at Mission Hospital in Mission 
Viejo. No charges have been filed against Kaufman, according to officials in 
the district attorney's office.

ROAD PANEL WANTS TO BLOCK IRVINE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine may soon join Laguna Beach in being deemed ineligible for a share of a 
multimillion-dollar fund used to help improve major roads throughout Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
An advisory committee for the county's Arterial Highway Financing Program is 
recommending that the city be denied any of that money during the next fiscal 
year because, the committee contends, the city's road improvement plan is not 
compatible with the county's master road plan. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach has been on the list for the same reason for a year. The committee 
is recommending that it remain there for at least one year more. 
</P>
<P>
The fund for the 1989-90 fiscal year, which begins July 1, is $9.8 million. The 
advisory committee is recommending that the money be used to pay for 47 
projects in 24 cities. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim would get the most money under the committee's plan: up to $600,000 for 
improvements to Anaheim Boulevard from Cypress Street to Lemon Street. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee members are County Supervisors Don R. Roth and Roger R. 
Stanton, Buena Park Mayor Donna L. Chessen, Fountain Valley City Councilman 
James E. Neal and Villa Park City Councilman Wayne W. Silzel. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the committee's 
recommendations next week. 
</P>
<P>
Neal said the committee ignored a recommendation from its technical staff to 
merely warn Irvine that its eligibility status was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some other cities have streets that don't comply with the master plan, but 
Irvine and Laguna Beach are the only ones with major roads that don't comply," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine officials could not be reached for comment. Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. 
Gentry said officials from his city would try to persuade the supervisors to 
ignore the advisory committee's recommendation as it applies to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of aging roads in our city that need repair," Gentry said. 
"We not only need that money, we count on it." 
</P>
<P>
David Updegraff, a senior civil engineer for the county, said the purpose of 
the county's master plan is to coordinate the major road programs countywide. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a six-lane road suddenly to become a two-lane road when it 
leaves one city and enters another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, he said, has for years omitted from its road plan several linkages that 
show up in the county's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Those problems were supposed to be studied and worked on," he said, "but there 
really has been no progress." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach and the county, Updegraff said, have reached a compromise "in 
principle" on the major dispute between them: what to do about a section of El 
Toro Road just north of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor route. 
But, Updegraff said, Laguna Beach has not submitted documents to show that it 
is now in compliance with the county rules.

'JUST THE BEGINNING': CANCER PATIENT GETS DIPLOMA AT HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The auditorium at UCI Medical Center is not normally the setting for a 
commencement, but Buena Park High School students gathered there Thursday, 
along with school and hospital officials, to honor a young man who has held on 
to his dreams despite a life-threatening illness. 
</P>
<P>
Hendryck Mejia, who sported a green cap and gown in keeping with the occasion, 
was the star attraction in the special ceremony -- the lone graduate. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 friends and relatives watched as the usually cheerful senior strolled 
down the aisle to a stage where he added a pair of green-mirrored eyeshades to 
his outfit and received his high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
The auditorium, decorated with streamers cascading down from dozens of 
balloons, took on the festive mood of a rite of passage. And though there was 
no band -- only a record player -- to provide the strains of "Pomp and 
Circumstance," the anticipation of a graduate moving on to new challenges was 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just the beginning," the 18-year-old graduate shouted to well-wishers 
with the same optimism that has helped him weather a 6-year battle with 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"Wipe those tears from your eyes," he told them as they showered him with hugs, 
kisses and gifts after the 20-minute ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his struggles with cancer -- or maybe even because of them -- Mejia 
hopes to become a physician and someday find a cure for the disease that may 
claim his life. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the medical center in Orange presented him with a white lab coat 
and an honorary degree in medicine on Thursday as a "head start." 
</P>
<P>
The special ceremony was arranged by hospital and school officials because 
Mejia will be undergoing an intense round of chemotherapy today and is not 
expected to regain his strength by June 15, the official graduation date for 
his high school. 
</P>
<P>
Principal George Giokaris said Mejia had already met all graduation 
requirements and that Thursday's ceremony was the school's response to "an 
extremely special circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
At the commencement, Giokaris, like others, praised Mejia for his strength and 
the lessons he had taught others. 
</P>
<P>
"You've taught us to nurture friendships and to make sure each interaction is 
meaningful," the principal said.

JANET EVANS DECIDES TO SWIM FOR STANFORD; 
</P>
<P>
SHE PICKS THE CARDINAL OVER TEXAS, FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Evans, who won three gold medals swimming in the Olympics, said Thursday 
she has signed a letter of intent to attend Stanford in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a senior at El Dorado High School, has been besieged by recruiters in 
recent weeks. She said she chose Stanford for its academics and its strong swim 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal women's team won the 1989 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. swim 
championship. Stanford also won the title in 1983 and has never finished lower 
than third since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I feel I've recruited one of the greatest athletes in American 
history," said Stanford women's swimming coach Richard Quick, who was coach of 
the 1988 U.S. Olympic swimming team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a hard time deciding," Evans said. "Texas, Florida and Stanford all have 
good programs. But I really like girls on the team at Stanford. I liked the 
school and I can get a good education there." 
</P>
<P>
Evans said she plans to major in communications. 
</P>
<P>
"I like working with people and I would like to do something in broadcasting," 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
She also wants to swim in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Evans holds world records in the 400-meter individual medley, 400 freestyle and 
800 freestyle. She won gold medals in all three events last September at the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Her victories in Seoul brought numerous endorsement offers. However, Evans said 
that she turned down the offers to maintain her amateur standing. 
</P>
<P>
"At first it was tempting, but I've always wanted to swim in college," Evans 
said. "I didn't want to forfeit my education. I'm 17, I want to be a kid for a 
while longer." 
</P>
<P>
Evans began gaining attention in 1986 as she won two bronze medals at the 
Goodwill Games in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Her small stature (5-foot-4, less than 100 pounds) and unorthodoxed style of 
swimming, which El Dorado Coach Tom Milich once likened to a Cuisinart, made 
her unique. Evans said she takes 52 strokes of freestyle per 50-meter pool. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Swimming Open in 1987, Evans set world records in the 400 freestyle 
(4 minutes 5.45 seconds), 800 freestyle (8:24.71 seconds) and 400 individual 
medley (4:39.75). She later lowered her time in the 400 freestyle to 4:03.85. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first American woman swimmer to hold three world records at one 
time since Debbie Meyer held four in 1968. The last women swimmer to hold three 
was Kornelia Ender of East Germany in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her international success, Evans continued to swim for her high school 
team. Last year she set national high school records in the 500-yard freestyle 
(4:37.30) and 200 individual medley (2:00.72). 
</P>
<P>
She is favored to win those event again Saturday in the Southern Section 3-A 
finals at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest decision I ever had to make," Evans said. "My parents said 
they would support whatever decision I made. I weighed the pros and cons and 
picked Stanford. I'm really happy with the decision and think it's for the 
best."

SANTA MARGARITA TO FIND HOME IN COUNTY LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Margarita High School, the $26-million Catholic school in southern Orange 
County, moved a step closer to finding a home for its athletic teams Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County league representatives recommended to the Southern Section 
Executive Committee that the school be placed in the Orange County area 
beginning in the fall of 1990, which would place the school in an Orange County 
league for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita will likely be placed in the Pacific Coast, Sea View or South 
Coast league, according to Trabuco Hills Principal Bill Brand, who attended the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a first for Orange County," Brand said. "This is the first time we've 
had an opportunity to experience a parochial school in a public school league." 
</P>
<P>
County principals will meet next Friday meet to determine in which league to 
place the two-year-old school. 
</P>
<P>
The school will be a member of the Olympic League for the 1989-90 school year, 
but then will be placed in a new league as part of the realignment of Southern 
Section leagues for the 1990-91 and 1991-92 school years. 
</P>
<P>
League representatives and Santa Margarita athletic officials favored putting 
the school in the county public school leagues. The league representatives had 
two other choices, however. 
</P>
<P>
They could have placed the school in the small private schools group, which 
included leagues such as the Olympic. Typical enrollment in that league is 
about 500. Santa Margarita's current enrollment is 470, but is expected to 
reach 1,200 by the start of the 1991 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Or they could have put the school in the larger Catholic schools group, where 
it could have joined the Angelus League.

TITANS SUSPEND RAMIREZ FOR REST OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ralph Ramirez, Cal State Fullerton's starting third baseman, has been suspended 
for the rest of the season, Coach Larry Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, a senior, was dropped from the team after an incident in the dugout 
during Fullerton's loss to UC Riverside Tuesday. Cochell said that after being 
lifted for a pinch-hitter, Ramirez kicked over a chair. When asked to pick it 
up, Ramirez kicked it again, Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the team said the incident was one of many disciplinary 
incidents Ramirez was involved in this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was hitting .276 with four home runs and 26 runs batted in. He was 
second on the team with 24 errors. Fullerton, seeking an National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. playoff berth, finishes the regular season with a three-game 
series at Fresno, starting today. Randy Graves, a freshman, will replace 
Ramirez at third.

BIG WEST TRACK; 
</P>
<P>
UC IRVINE THIRD AFTER FIRST DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beth McGrann and Pete Vicencio of UC Irvine won individual titles at the Big 
West Conference track and field championships Thursday night at Cerritos 
College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The two seniors each scored 10 points to help Irvine's men's and women's squads 
to third place in the first day of the two-day meet. The meet continues at 1 
p.m. today with the decathlon and 110-meter high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's portion of the meet, after six final events, six-time defending 
champion Fresno State leads with 74 points, followed by Utah State (38) and 
Irvine (36). In the women's competition, after four finals, two-time defending 
champion Fresno State leads with 49 points, followed by UNLV (34) and Irvine 
(20). 
</P>
<P>
McGrann had little trouble defending her conference title in the 10,000 meters. 
McGrann took the lead from the start and won in 35 minutes 51.7 seconds -- a 
meet record, but far off her personal best of 33:07. 
</P>
<P>
Vicencio had a much more challenging time in winning his first Big West title, 
the steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
Vicencio ran the first half of the 3,000-meter long race about 15 yards behind 
the leaders, Fresno State's David Naranjo and Rod Heskett. Running comfortably, 
Vicencio gradually closed the gap, and with a lap to go, took the lead along 
with Brett Hill of Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
With 300 meters to go, Hill and Vicencio started their kick, and hurdled the 
final water jump shoulder to shoulder. On the final stretch, Vicencio outkicked 
the field to win in 9:02.26. Hill, who smacked his trail leg against the final 
barrier, finished third (9:05:14), after Naranjo (9:04:05) passed him in the 
final 20 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
Irvine thrower Mike Morales contributed 10 points to the men's total with a 
third in the hammer throw final, and a fourth in the discus. The Anteater men 
suffered a significant loss when Will Stolpe, the conference leader at 200 
meters, pulled a hamstring in the 100-meter heats. Stolpe is not expected to 
compete today. . . . Cal State Fullerton's Lori Shaw ran the fastest time of 
the day (56.38) in the women's 400 prelims.

COSTA MESA-BASED FIRM'S SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
MORTGAGE LIST DISPUTE PITS LENDERS AGAINST BROKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A scrap is brewing between mortgage lenders and real estate brokers over an 
obscure legal issue that could affect the way billions of dollars in mortgage 
loans are sold. 
</P>
<P>
The tussle has attracted little attention outside the real estate industry. But 
both sides have dispatched lobbyists to importune the federal Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, and both sides consider the stakes high. 
</P>
<P>
The fight concerns a computerized mortgage system devised by Prudential Real 
Estate Affiliates Inc. in Costa Mesa, a fledgling network of franchised real 
estate brokerages that the big insurance company started in 1987. At issue is 
the money Prudential pays its brokers who use the computer system. 
</P>
<P>
That system -- called CLOS, as in to "close" a loan -- electronically matches 
home buyers with a suitable mortgage from one of 10 or so lenders listed, 
including Prudential's own mortgage lending subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
For every customer who uses CLOS, the brokerage gets $100 from Prudential to 
reimburse the brokerage for hiring an employee to operate the system. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential plans to sign up 3,000 brokerages nationwide by 1993, and it 
estimates that lenders could eventually sell as much as $10 billion worth of 
loans through CLOS. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, says the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America, isn't the computer: 
It's that $100 fee. The trade association says it's a conflict of interest when 
a broker gets paid to refer customers to a mortgage lender. Lenders fear a 
broker will then "steer" customers only to certain lenders, where they might 
not get as good a deal. 
</P>
<P>
And, the lenders say, such an arrangement violates federal law governing real 
estate transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act -- RESPA -- forbids paying 
referral fees to brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential and the National Assn. of Realtors, on the other hand, say the money 
isn't a referral fee; it merely covers the brokers' costs of operating the 
computer, which is now permissible under federal law. Prudential has an October 
letter from HUD saying so. 
</P>
<P>
But HUD officials are writing new RESPA regulations at the urging of mortgage 
lenders, and both sides are pressing to persuade HUD to come down in their 
favor on the payments. 
</P>
<P>
Both powerful trade associations say they have the consumer's interest at 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that disturbs us is the 'Big Lie' technique the Mortgage Bankers 
Assn. is using," said William North, executive vice president of the National 
Assn. of Realtors. "They keep saying these payments are referral fees, when 
really the lenders are reimbursing the broker for running the computer system. 
</P>
<P>
"This system actually makes getting a mortgage a lot more convenient for 
consumers," North said. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says Robert M. O'Toole, senior staff vice president at the Mortgage 
Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view, it's purely a matter of getting a fee and steering a 
customer to that lender," O'Toole said. "And that's contrary to the law. 
Without the fee, we'd have no objection to computer mortgage systems." 
</P>
<P>
Computerized mortgage systems appeared in the early 1980s, long after Congress 
passed RESPA in 1974. But they didn't really catch on until recently. 
</P>
<P>
A second wave began a few years ago with Citicorp's MortgagePower. In 1986 HUD 
lawyers said Citicorp could reimburse brokers for their costs in running 
MortgagePower. The mortgage lenders got alarmed and persuaded HUD to reconsider 
its rules regarding the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act, which 
Congress intended to protect consumers in buying a home. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new rules were set out for public comment in May, and HUD was 
flooded with 2,000 responses, which it says is an unusually large number. Most 
of the comments, says the mortgage bankers group, were negative. 
</P>
<P>
In December a new set of regulations was leaked to the public which were much 
more favorable to the mortgage lenders. According to the lenders' 
interpretation, the new rules would have prohibited Prudential's $100 payment 
to its agents. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the matter stands now. HUD says it hasn't decided the issue yet, 
and both sides say HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has not yet committed himself 
either. 
</P>
<P>
The matter may ultimately be thrown back in Congress' lap, since either side 
could ask that the law be amended if they don't like the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential says it has its own lobbyists trying to catch HUD's ear. But 
meanwhile it's business at usual at the new Prudential subsidiary atop a 
mid-rise office building in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza area. 
</P>
<P>
After little more than a year, Prudential had 300 affiliates signed up by the 
end of April. They are required to use Prudential's computer system, although 
they aren't required to use CLOS, which stands for computerized loan 
origination system. 
</P>
<P>
CLOS works this way: The customer specifies what type of loan he's looking for 
-- adjustable rate, lowest monthly payment or some other requirement -- and the 
computer reads back the loans that come closest to fitting those requirements, 
deleting the lender's name from the information. 
</P>
<P>
If the loan is approved, the lender pays Prudential $425. 
</P>
<P>
But Prudential insists it's less interested in the money than in using CLOS as 
a way to sign up more brokerages for its franchise system. Prudential hopes the 
system will be a strong lure for attracting home buyers to its brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any ambitions to become mortgage lending kingpins," said Carl 
Espy, a senior vice president at Prudential Real Estate. "We're just trying to 
make the buyers feel more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Citicorp's MortgagePower, says Espy, the Prudential system offers more 
than one lender, with as many as 10 choices in some markets. While the system 
could eventually account for 20% of the loans on homes sold through its 
brokerages, Prudential says -- and possibly as much as half in some markets -- 
that still leaves as much as 80% of the loans to lenders not on the CLOS 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Already signed up for CLOS are several national lenders, including GMAC 
Mortgage Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage. Prudential is seeking a few 
more to combine with three or four local lenders in each state.

BEVERLY HILLS FIRM PAYS $35.2 MILLION FOR 4 ORANGE COUNTY INDUSTRIAL PARKS

Hanover Real Estate Associates of Beverly Hills bought four small industrial 
parks in Orange County for $35.2 million in what will probably turn out to be 
one of the larger real estate deals of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Selling was Orange County Industrial Property Associates. Three of the parks 
were in Anaheim: Tustin Avenue Business Park, 1211 N. Tustin Ave.; Lakeview 
Business Center, 1480 N. Lakeview Ave.; and Canyon Commercentre, 5401 E. La 
Palma Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth was Costa Mesa's Seaview West Business Park, 930 W. 16th St. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition means Hanover -- an investment arm of Delaware's Hanover 
Acceptances -- now owns nearly 1 million square feet of industrial space worth 
$78 million in Orange County, most of it in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether the firm's real estate investments total $230 million nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The firm likes Anaheim because of the proximity of freeways and its 
"competitive land prices," said C. Dennis Abramson, managing general partner of 
Hanover Associates and a former shopping mall designer.

Irvine Sensors Corp. lost $262,500 for the second fiscal quarter ended April 2, 
more than double the $123,600 loss for the comparable quarter in 1988. Revenue 
declined 20%, to $710,200 from $886,300. For the first half of fiscal 1989, the 
company lost $456,500, compared to a loss of $379,800 for the like period last 
year. Revenue dropped 8%, to $1.4 million from $1.5 million. James Alexiou, 
president, said the timing of specific awards interrupted the 
quarter-to-quarter improvements that the company experienced over the last year 
and a half. Irvine Sensors, headquartered in Costa Mesa, develops infrared 
devices and high-density packages of computer electronics for military and 
commercial systems.

Some people might have been surprised earlier this week to see a sharp drop in 
home sales reported in Orange County in April. But in fact home sales have been 
dropping all year, says TRW Real Estate Market Information. 
</P>
<P>
Last year saw an unusually large number of sales, so this year's slowing may be 
little more than the market catching its breath, say experts. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Orange County registered the second largest drop of the 25 
counties tracked by TRW for the first 3 months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The number of new and used houses and condominiums sold dropped 10.7%, TRW 
said, making Orange County next to last before San Mateo County, where sales 
fell 19.9%. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale, Riverside led all counties with a 44.3% increase 
in sales, and San Bernardino was fourth with an 18.5% increase.

ROLLINS TAKES SMORGASBORD APPROACH TO ARTS; 
</P>
<P>
FOUNDER OF PUNK PIONEER BLACK FLAG BRINGS HIS ECLECTIC ACT TO CAL STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the 1986 breakup of Black Flag, founding member Henry Rollins has taken 
the smorgasbord approach to life: publishing books, telling stories, releasing 
spoken-word recordings and tending to his music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always eating, but I'm switching plates," Rollins said this week from his 
home in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Rollins, who was lead singer 
for Black Flag, the L.A. punk pioneers, will perform tonight at Cal State 
Fullerton's University Center Pub. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins' spoken performances started as more-or-less formal readings when he 
first appeared in 1983 at the Lhasa Club in Los Angeles. His stage act has 
since become more improvisational, relying less on his writings and more on 
spinning tales from real life. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been telling stories," said Rollins, 28, whose act has been 
described as "part pantomime, part stand-up comedy, part guerrilla theater." 
</P>
<P>
He also continues to write daily in his journal. His eighth self-published book 
is at the printer. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, writing can't capture what I do with the speaking," he said. "When I 
speak, I just kind of go off." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been telling his stories for several years now, it can still be 
frightening to face an audience alone. "I just finished 10 weeks of this 
(international) tour, and it's the hardest thing I've ever done," Rollins said. 
"You can't hide behind the music." 
</P>
<P>
He likened the experience to "unpeeling yourself like a navel orange: You feel 
kind of raw afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Rollins started writing in high school, as a way of expressing the alienation 
he felt as a teen, which he described as a "horrible" part of his life: "I used 
to just write to get it out of me, and that's what I still do." 
</P>
<P>
Later, when he was invited to sing for Black Flag, he found an outlet in music. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to pursue his music and is negotiating a recording contract for 
the Henry Rollins Band. The group has a studio album in the can and plans to 
embark in August for a 7-month world tour. 
</P>
<P>
In music, as in his writings and spoken performances, Rollins said, he strives 
for an honest connection with his audience, preferring to dispense with 
show-biz conventions. Rollins seems to have struck a chord: He said he gets 
almost 100 letters a week, many from young people who write to say they relate 
to Rollins' stories and songs, which often deal with the trials of growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"That gets me all feeling good," Rollins said. "People are really hungry for 
direct communication." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rollins will appear tonight at 8 in Cal State Fullerton's University 
Center Pub, 800 N. State College Blvd. in Fullerton. Advance tickets are $6 for 
students and $7 general; $8 at the door. Information: (714) 773-3501.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttomare, 545 Newport Center Dr., Newport Beach. (714) 640-6333. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays 11 to midnight; Saturdays 11:30 
to midnight, Sundays 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is fluid and solicitious at this smart, stunning restaurant, located 
in the building that used to house the Savannah Grill, but the kitchen is 
having its ups and downs. Wonderful, yeasty foccaccia bread served with virgin 
olive oil and the fine grilled seafoods are some of the ups. Naked vegetables 
and bland pasta dishes are some of the downs. Lombata di vitello, veal chop 
with fontina and prosciutto, is one reason to go back for a second look. 
</P>
<P>
Umi, 2075 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 631-2208. Open Tuesdays through 
Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30, Fridays and Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
Umi is a modern and imaginative but often unprofessional sushi bar with 
high-tech pretensions, and knowing what to order is important: You are safe if 
you stick with the sushi, which is fresh and crafted with an excellently 
prepared rice, but it is easy to run aground on the many hot dishes. Among 
them, best are a wonderful scallop casserole, a toothsome Japanese steak, and 
yaki-onigiri, grilled triangles of sushi rice with various fillings. Service 
can be painfully slow. 
</P>
<P>
Pinnacle Peak, 9100 Trask Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 892-7311. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Dr., Santa Ana. (714) 549-1512. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturdays and Sundays 5 p.m. to 2 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else is busy disavowing addiction to good steak, sneak off to 
one of these places. Leave the tie at home when you visit Pinnacle Peak; 
someone will sneak up on you and cut it off. Honest. The restaurant's trail 
boss steak, cooked over an open flame, is a char-broiled monster, a great value 
at $9.95. The Crazy Horse is a bit longer on atmosphere but, apart from the 
high-grade beef, it's run-of-the-mill. Many of the side dishes have been 
frozen, and the whole place has a packaged feel about it. 
</P>
<P>
Garduno's Ristorante Italiano, 298 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-5505. 
Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays till 10 p.m., 
Saturdays noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Garduno's may be the quintessential Italian sidewalk cafe-except the sidewalk 
is missing. Mark and Julie Garduno, an engaging young couple, run the place as 
if it was a small family room, serving fresh, home-cooked fare that often 
delights. Standout dishes include a killer carbonara loaded with fresh peas, 
pancetta and sauteed mushrooms; and a fabulous fusilli, twirly pasta spirals in 
a chunky tomato sauce with big pieces of homemade sausage. The regular menu has 
all the favorites, the cappuccino is frothy, and there are wonderful creamy 
cheesecakes to boot. 
</P>
<P>
California Wok, 4466 Cerritos Ave., Los Alamitos. (714) 527-0226. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Eat health conscious, pan-Asian food in this spotless litle gem, owned and 
operated by a Thai microbiologist who is a gem herself (her name, Baiyok, means 
jade leaf.) Chinese dishes here are excellent, prepared with pure soy oil. 
Especially good are vegetarian egg rolls, and stir fried chicken in an edible 
basket of straw potato. Thai dishes are equally fine. Nam sod is fiery ground 
pork with chili. Pad Thai are fried flat noodles. And tod mun plar, rubbery 
fish cakes with mint and cilantro, are wonderful.

DINNER AT KACHINA OF LAGUNA BEACH COMES FROM A PAINTER'S PALATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Wilhelm is quietly establishing himself as a restaurant superstar, and 
the view from here is that his reputation can only grow. Those who remember him 
when he cooked at Pave, the Newport Beach restaurant he operated with his wife, 
Nancy, are aware that he can fashion elegance out of humble ingredients. Those 
who have eaten dishes he conceived for the El Torito Grill probably think of 
him as a trend setter. 
</P>
<P>
At Kachina in Laguna Beach, Wilhelm is doing something different still, 
combining trend and elegance with a highly personal stamp. The restaurant, 
named for a type of American Indian doll, is housed in the lowest level of a 
building whose upper floor is a Southwest art gallery. The motif is that of an 
adobe hut with glowing, almost translucent lighting to offset the burnt ochre 
walls. Blond wood tables are adorned with pastel stoneware crockery, and the 
servers wear colorful uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is a family affair from start to finish. Wife Nancy is hostess 
and maitre'd. Daughter Heather Wilhelm is one of the servers. Even the owner's 
brother, artist Bob Wilhelm, gets into the act: The walls are graced with his 
color-splashed modern sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is splashed with color too, created by the owner with some help from 
head chef Thomas Tran. How's this for color? Blue corn taquitos with smoked 
chicken and green chiles with avocado sauce. Grilled swordfish with desert 
sunset sauce and pink grapefruit salsa. 
</P>
<P>
The tastes are almost as spectacular. After a few sips of wine and a bite of a 
dry blue-corn jalapeno muffin, my senses were riveted by one of the best dishes 
I have ever had: gulf shrimp and green-corn tamale with salsa verde and crema 
fresca. 
</P>
<P>
The shrimps were plump and full of flavor, and the tamale alone, which was soft 
as pudding in a steaming husk, would have been good enough to bring me back. 
But it was the humble sounding salsa verde, a rough-hewn, pale green puree that 
made the dish so memorable. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by a fabulous salad: grilled quail salad with toasted onions 
and mango chutney. The bird was perfectly charred on mesquite, the vegetables 
fresh and crispy, the impossible sounding flavors stunningly well matched, and 
the presentation so eye-catching it wouldn't have looked out of place on the 
wall alongside the other objets d'art. 
</P>
<P>
If this restaurant has one flaw, it is a menu with too much color -- putting a 
meal together here takes some work. Wilhelm often seems dazzled by his own 
skill. Too much creativity can cloud the canvas; the audience may miss the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
For example, four of us split a terrific goat cheese relleno with a crisp 
cornmeal coating and a papaya-red onion salsa. The crunchy coating seemed born 
for the soft, melted cheese filling, and the crazy quilt salsa worked like a 
charm. After that we nibbled on a corn crepe filled with honey roast duck in a 
jalapeno barbecue sauce; except for a sneaky sweet aftertaste the filling 
reminded me of a prize-winning chili. But what would we do for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
No one was sure. Matching the appetizers with the intricate main courses, (corn 
flour fettuccine with chicken in fire-roasted tomato sauce with wild sage, or 
honey-glazed pork with black beans, pueblo corn pudding and guacamole) was no 
mean feat. A friend remarked it was like a foodie jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
The dishes we finally chose were all wonderful. Honey-glazed pork was probably 
the best, crackling on the outside, tender on the inside, with a soft corn 
pudding quite like the green-corn tamale. Grilled chicken came on fresh corn 
and green pepper, in a smooth red-pepper butter. The grilled swordfish with 
grapefruit salsa (something I was reluctant to try) worked well. A lobster tail 
quesadilla was sheer artistry. 
</P>
<P>
Any complaints? Well, only a couple. One dish I wanted most was sold out on 
both nights I dined there (mesquite smoked duck with tequila mole sauce and 
creamy Indian polenta.) And a corn crepe burrito of lobster, shrimp, and 
peppers in smoked chile cream had too much pancake and not enough seafood.

There are only four desserts, but they are stunners. Warm chocolate bread 
pudding (my favorite), a soupy, fudgy delight topped with steamed milk, tasted 
the way I always hoped one of these desserts would, like chocolate cake right 
out of the oven. A fine, deep-yellow flan with berries was full of egg yolk and 
burnt sugar. The super-creamy tequila-raisin ice cream, made commercially for 
Wilhelm from an original recipe, was about perfect. And the pinon-pecan pie 
looked wonderful, although none of us had room for a bite. I flirted briefly 
with the idea of bringing a piece home . . . to put on my wall, of course.

Kachina is moderate to expensive. Appetizers are $4 to $7.50. Combination 
plates are $11.50 to $12.50. Southwest specialties are $9.75 to $16.50. 
Desserts are $4.25 to $4.75. The small, appealing wine list on the back of the

BUT SERIOUSLY, FOLKS, KLOS-FM DEEJAY BRINGS 4 COMEDIANS TO THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Five O'Clock Funnies," a regular radio segment on KLOS-FM (95.5) in which 
disc jockey Geno Michellini airs excerpts of comics' routines, comes to life -- 
and to Orange County -- in a show Saturday at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Emceed by Michellini, the show will present four comedians -- Tim Allen, John 
Mendoza, Pam Stone and Dr. Gonzo -- each performing about 25-minute sets. 
</P>
<P>
Though none is a household name, all four have been toiling on the stand-up 
circuit for many years; collectively they have amassed a slew of television 
credits, including "The Tonight Show," "Late Night With David Letterman" and 
"George Schlatter's Comedy Club," as well as stints on HBO and Showtime cable 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit resident Tim Allen is probably one of the freshest, best comedians most 
people on the West Coast haven't heard of. Early in his sets, Allen typically 
sets up the premise that "men are pigs," which he punctuates with a pig snort. 
</P>
<P>
This idea -- and the attendant pig snort -- then becomes a running theme, 
usually commingled with another running theme: that men love tools. Or at least 
Allen does, to the extreme that he rewires everything from the vacuum cleaner 
to the garbage disposal to make them more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
This approach may sound more strange than amusing, but it's both distinctive 
and very funny, which is why Allen has been known to bring down the house in 
such disparate locales as New York, Las Vegas and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
New Yawker John Mendoza opts for more standard stand-up, although his act is 
far from plain or generic. His material is sharp and succinct, and he rarely 
lingers long on any subject before moving on to some similarly concise comment. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one of the strongest parts of his act is when Mendoza shifts into a 
breezy hit-and-run mode, forgoing segues altogether: "Ever wonder if illiterate 
people get the full effect of alphabet soup?" . . . Pause. . . . "I saw an ad 
in the L.A. Times that said 'If you have a hard time making decisions, call us 
at 279-8483 or 569 . . . ' " . . . Pause. "You know what the abbreviation for 
July is? J-U-L. You've gotta be in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Willowy Pam Stone is a native of Atlanta, where she was working as a cocktail 
waitress in a comedy club when she decided to try her hand at telling jokes. It 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a few years later, she's living in Los Angeles and working as a headliner 
at clubs across the country, dispensing with a slight drawl observational 
comedy about assorted topics. Stone was recently nominated in the Best Female 
Comedy Club Stand-Up category of the American Comedy Awards, which will be 
announced later this month. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime fixture on the Bay Area comedy scene, Dr. Gonzo (given name: John 
Means) has been dubbed "The Doc of Comedy Rock." Bringing an added shot of 
variety to Saturday's bill, Dr. Gonzo specializes in song parodies, which he 
not only performs when headlining clubs, but as a frequent opener in arenas for 
another Bay Area act, Huey Lewis and the News. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celebrity Theatre is at 201 E. Broadway St., Anaheim. Show time: 8 p.m. 
Tickets: $17.50. Information: (714) 999-9536.

STYLE: ELITE TO VIEW LATEST FROM MACKIE AND DE LA RENTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the elite group invited, this weekend's haute couture happening at Amen 
Wardy's boutique will be more than memorable. The fashions of heavyweights Bob 
Mackie and Oscar de la Renta will be shown back-to-back to benefit Angelitos de 
Oro, a support group for Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
For Bob Mackie, a California native who now lives in New York, it will be like 
Old Home Week. He and Wardy have been friends for years, and his mother lives 
in Laguna Beach. But before he spends Mother's Day with her, Mackie will send 
his glamorous gowns swirling down the runway under a giant tent outside the 
swank Newport Beach salon. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, Oscar de la Renta's fashions will be shown under the tent today 
at a $125-a-plate lunch and fashion show for 600 guests. Then the Mackie dinner 
and show Saturday night -- for 400 guests paying $250 each -- will bring to 
town a gigantic slice of Hollywood. And Mackie can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I love California and I love going back for any reason, but especially the 
shows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cherubic-faced, 47-year-old designer -- best known for draping Cher and 
other luminaries in glittering ensembles -- says he enjoys doing the Wardy 
shows because the boutique is "absolutely the most lavish shop of its kind." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is done beautifully, the ballroom is gorgeous, and it's a pleasure 
to be there and deal with such an incredible merchant . . . and I can't say 
that about anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
But aside from Wardy's retail wizardry, Mackie likes the location. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens he picked a lovely place to put the (boutique)," he said. "God 
knows there's not a lovelier place to be than right there" in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday night crowd will see a 94-piece couture collection inspired by 
medieval literature and the ancient art of astrology. Forest green, garnet, 
burnt sienna, plum and teal are the predominant colors in elaborate and courtly 
silhouettes with swirling coats, majestic trains and lavish details. The 
collection also incorporates a splash of bright hues -- orange, yellow, purple, 
emerald green and fiery red. 
</P>
<P>
Like many top designers who unveiled their fall collections last month in New 
York, Mackie is making the most of luxurious fabrics, rich colors and silk 
chiffons. 
</P>
<P>
Women's Wear Daily called his astrology-inspired pieces "a hoot of a zodiac 
group." Bloomingdale's called the collection "star quality with humor." 
</P>
<P>
Mackie's wit races through the collection, which he says was inspired by 
ancient literature and fairy-tale characters. Each piece is paired with a 
storybook name: "The Tale of the Golden Trumpet" is a tapestry coat over a 
burnt sienna, pleated dress; "The Tale of the Enchanted Pocket" is a simple 
black skimmer with a single jeweled pocket, and, as a salute to Rapunzel, four 
pieces are named after the longhaired maiden. 
</P>
<P>
The titles are his own invention. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not actual pieces of literature, but they ought to be stories," says 
Mackie with a laugh. "My assistants said, 'What if people ask us where these 
things come from?' and I said, 'Just ask me, I'll tell you some stories,' and 
so I made up a few to go with them." 
</P>
<P>
Among the collection's bright cocktail dresses, tapestry coats, wool jersey 
princess dresses and beaded cropped jackets over ankle-sweeping dresses are 
some swirling numbers in ombre chiffon, and these are the designer's favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like the way the chiffon moves," he says. "I started about a year ago 
working with chiffons, and people seem to really spark to it." 
</P>
<P>
After more than 2 decades of costume designing, in which he earned six Emmy 
awards and three Oscar nominations, Mackie moved to New York 7 years ago to 
begin couture designing. 
</P>
<P>
Because his reputation was built on glamorous evening clothes, Mackie strives 
hard for well-received daytime apparel. 
</P>
<P>
"People always took notice of my evening things because of all my theatrical 
work of the past," he says, referring to his 25 years of costume designing in 
Hollywood and subsequent years of star-dressing. "They do come easier for me. 
There is a certain relaxed kind of joy about designing them. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm always pleased when a snappy daytime outfit does well, because they 
don't always expect that from me." 
</P>
<P>
And although at first he resented his "Mr. Hollywood" nickname, now he 
regularly taps California's glitz for inspiration. His spring '89 collection 
was based entirely on "the California look," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he first moved to New York, he started rather tentatively, with 
conservative, "polite" outfits, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"But everybody kept saying, 'Where's all the good stuff?' " 
</P>
<P>
So now his collections include plenty of the showstoppers that everybody 
expects from him. 
</P>
<P>
Providing a slight contrast to Mackie's sparkle, Oscar de la Renta's is a more 
serious collection, with a hefty dose of sensible, luxurious daytime looks. 
</P>
<P>
De la Renta was asked to show his designs for this weekend's Angelitos de Oro 
charity because "Amen thought his fall collection was the designer's best work 
yet," according to Wardy's assistant, Annie Bower. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved the colors, he said the fabrics are very elegant, and everything is 
very, very wearable." 
</P>
<P>
The fashion press has heralded his fall line's focus on comfortable, simple 
designs in luxurious fabrics: weightless coats of wool crepe, quilted coats 
with touches of Kashmir embroidery, wool jersey dresses and jackets trimmed in 
gold braid. 
</P>
<P>
Syd Shaw, a de la Renta spokeswoman, said the designer's color choices for the 
season were inspired by the deep tones of Old Master paintings -- garnet, 
purple, mulberry, plum and burnished gold.

MADD IS OFFERING A PROMISING GIFT FOR MOTHER'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Mothers Against Drunk Driving has come up with an unusual gift 
for teen-agers to give their mothers on Mother's Day: a greeting card that 
carries a pledge by the son or daughter not to drink and drive or to ride with 
a driver who has been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
The cards will be available today through Sunday in stationery departments or 
at Orange County MADD booths in 43 Broadway department stores in Los Angeles, 
Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a donation from the Broadway stores of Southern California, the cards 
are available for a $1 donation to MADD to be used for programs for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrations will be held today from 2 to 8 p.m. and Saturday from noon to 6 
p.m. at the Broadway stores in Huntington Beach and Brea. 
</P>
<P>
An organization begun by 11 high school students last year to produce anti-drug 
films won $50,000 and the top honor recently at the annual Disneyland Community 
Service awards luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Student Advisory Council Against Drug Abuse was among 63 
groups to receive a total of $250,000 from Disneyland at the 32nd annual awards 
presentation at the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The council, started in February, 1988, has grown to more than 100 students 
from 60 high schools. They have produced three 90-second public videos that are 
showing in local theaters. The students do all the writing and acting; the goal 
is to help students deal with peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Nimisha Gohal, 18, one of the original council members, said that the honor 
came as a complete surprise and that she started shaking as it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing what we have done," Gohal said. "We wanted to form a council to 
let students know that it's OK to say no to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Gohal, a senior at Orange High School, said the council will use the $50,000 to 
make another video. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 452 nonprofit organizations had applied for the awards. Winners were 
selected by a six-member committee of community leaders and all of the money 
awards were donated by Disneyland.

HIGH SCHOOLERS BLEND PART-TIME JOBS INTO LEARNING PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CUTIE LEE, Cutie Lee is a senior at Capistrano Valley High School, where she 
is a reporter on Paw Prints, the student newspaper; president of the Future 
Business Leaders of America club, and a member of the Academic Decathlon team. 
In the fall, she will attend UC Berkeley, where she plans to major in 
communications. She also works part-time at a dry-cleaning store in Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many students, working a part-time job is an important part of their lives, 
right up there with their family, friends and school. Students work a variety 
of jobs for a variety of reasons, the main one being money. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, more than 70% of the respondents to a recent poll at Capistrano Valley 
High School said that money was the main reason they took a part-time job. They 
said they spend their earnings on gasoline, vacations and presents. Some are 
saving to buy a car or to go to college. Others use their wages to pay for 
automobile insurance or to travel abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Where are students finding part-time jobs these days? 
</P>
<P>
Junior Jeanne Eidt works in retail sales, while senior Eric Kaufman is employed 
at Wild Rivers and senior Robin Swift works for United Parcel Service. Some 
other popular places of employment are gift shops, restaurants, department 
stories, pizza parlors and frozen yogurt stores. Also popular are jobs as 
baby-sitters, lifeguards and recreation leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy, very low pressure," said senior Janeil Gilbert of her job at a 
video store. "Our customers are very nice because we have regular ones who come 
in often. People always ask me to recommend a movie, and then they rent 
something else!" 
</P>
<P>
According to the polled students, earnings range from the minimum wage of $4.25 
to $6 an hour. They often work weekends and holidays, from a minimum of a 
couple of hours a night to all day. Junior Janet Chen says her job at Crown 
Valley Library in Laguna Niguel doesn't interfere with her schoolwork. "I work 
2-hour shifts, two times a week," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe that teachers are naturally against their students having 
part-time jobs during the school year, thinking the work takes time away from 
the educational process. But this is not always the case. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley history teacher Debbie Burdyshaw approves of students working 
"if they can keep up their grades . . . but no more than 20 to 25 hours a week 
during the school year." 
</P>
<P>
Some instructors believe there are advantages to students holding down 
part-time jobs. English teacher Jennifer Johnson said a job helps students 
budget their time and lets them see "what the real world is like. . . . All 
jobs aren't easy or interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Drama teacher Keith Lockhart said students who work "seem to be more 
organized." 
</P>
<P>
And art teacher Holly Smirl said a job "teaches the value of money and 
responsibility in a paid position." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Capistrano Valley teachers responding to a recent poll were in 
favor of students taking on part-time jobs, just as long as the work doesn't 
interfere with their schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do my homework there," said Gilbert, who works 12 to 15 hours a week at 
the video store. "It's an ideal job, right down the hill from my house. We 
close at 8 on school nights and 9 on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
But senior Maureen Phelan, a restaurant hostess, must find time away from her 
job to do her schoolwork. "During work, it's hard to get homework done," she 
said. "It takes a lot of study hours." 
</P>
<P>
Many student workers said their jobs are not related to the work they plan on 
doing for a living. But some said the jobs they hold now will help them in the 
future. Junior Nicole Sicotte said of her job as a courtesy clerk at a Vons 
grocery store: "It will help me deal with people better." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jennifer Kingston, who works as a cashier at a Sizzler restaurant, 
said, "It will be easier to get the job that I want because I will have had 
experience in the restaurant business."

<P>
A three-car collision left two people injured, one seriously, and forced the 
closure of Carbon Canyon Road in Brea for two hours this morning, backing up 
rush hour traffic for several miles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Alva Svoboda of Brea was seriously injured after his car collided head on with 
a van at 7:45 a.m., Brea Police Lt. James Winder said. 
</P>
<P>
Svoboda, 55, was driving eastbound on Carbon Canyon Road near the Carbon Canyon 
Regional Park when his car veered into the opposing traffic lane and crashed 
into the van driven by Judith Lynn Gober, 29, of Chino, Winder said. After 
being hit by Svoboda, her van was hit from behind by a pickup being driven by 
her husband, Bryan Gober. 
</P>
<P>
Winder said Svoboda suffered severe internal injuries and was airlifted to 
UCI-Medical Center in Orange. Judith Gober was taken to Brea Community 
Hospital, where she was treated for moderate injuries.

A runaway freight train careened down the Cajon Pass, leaped the tracks, 
plunged down a 30-foot embankment and slammed into 14 homes this morning, 
killing a trainman and two boys in one of the houses. At least seven others 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
All four locomotives and 69 cars of the Southern Pacific train left the track 
at what several witnesses estimated at more than 100 m.p.h., piling into a 
grotesque heap of twisted metal that literally flattened two of the homes, 
including the one in which the boys -- believed to be brothers, 7 and 10 -- 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tons of potash from the train spilled into the yards, houses and 
streets, burying much of the rubble. Stuffed toys, furniture and kitchen 
utensils were scattered amid the dusty, splintered debris. 
</P>
<P>
Police, firefighters and neighbors clawed through the wreckage to free the 
moaning injured and rush them to nearby hospitals. Three hours after the 7:43 
a.m. crash, paramedics were still working with power tools in the effort to 
free the body of the dead trainman from the lead locomotive. None of the dead 
and injured was immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately determined what caused the train, which was bound for 
Long Beach from Mojave, to burst out of control on the long grade down the 
historic pass between the high Mojave Desert and the San Bernardino Valley 
below. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know yet what happened," said Bob Hoppe, a spokesman for the Southern 
Pacific Transportation Co. in San Francisco. "What we know . . . is that it got 
going pretty fast . . . very fast." 
</P>
<P>
The train sped for miles down the 2.2% grade before leaping from the tracks on 
a curve, ripping through some power lines and crashing into the tract of modest 
single-story houses near Highland Avenue and Duffy Street on the northwest side 
of San Bernardino. The largely minority neighborhood is sometimes referred to 
as the Muscoy area. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw some sparks fly through the air," said Angela McKenzie, 13, who was 
about to get into the family car and leave for school when she heard the rumble 
of the approaching train. 
</P>
<P>
"The train was going 100 m.p.h.," she said. "It was coming at us. I heard a 
screech and saw the first car come over. Then the other cars smashed behind it 
and fell on the houses." 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible," said Dane Maloney, who was leaving his home for the drive to 
work when the train hit. "There were train cars on top of houses. Train cars on 
top of cars." 
</P>
<P>
Diesel fuel leaked from the shattered train, and officials concerned about the 
threat of fire evacuated the neighborhood. However, the fuel did not ignite, 
and the officials said the train was not carrying any toxic material that posed 
a hazard to residents or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board sent a field representative from Los 
Angeles and a team of experts from its headquarters in Washington to 
investigate the accident. San Bernardino police and fire personnel cordoned off 
the area, and the Red Cross set up an emergency evacuation center.

FIRST WAVE OF TROOPS LANDS IN PANAMA;

U.S. CONTINUES TO PUT DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE ON NORIEGA TO LEAVE

<P>
Combat troops began arriving today in Panama from U.S. air bases, part of 
President Bush's order to protect American lives as the United States mobilizes 
diplomatic pressure to force the ouster of military leader Manuel Antonio 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The first wave of Marine reinforcements from Camp Lejeune, N.C., and Army 
troops from the 7th Light Infantry Division at Ft. Ord, Calif., flew to Panama 
as part of the Defense Department's operation, dubbed "Nimrod Dancer." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, reacting to postelection violence, announced the deployment Thursday of 
2,000 combat troops to Panama to augment the 10,000 American service personnel 
stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
The President also said he was ready to explore ways to entice Noriega to step 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic moves included a meeting today in Washington of the Organization of 
American States, where members of the permanent council unanimously approved a 
Venezuelan resolution calling for a special meeting Wednesday to discuss the 
Panama crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Will Not Be Intimidated' 
</P>
<P>
"I will do what is necessary to protect the lives of American citizens, and we 
will not be intimidated by the bullying tactics, brutal though they may be, of 
the dictator, Noriega," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush's national security adviser questioned both the 
likelihood of a real confrontation with Noriega and the efficacy of the 
President's action to try to force Panama's de facto ruler from power. 
</P>
<P>
"(Noriega) is a thug, but he clearly operates with some prudence when he has 
to," said National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. He called the troop 
buildup "precautionary as much as anything else," although Bush had said in his 
news conference, "I'm worried about the lives of American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft all but acknowledged that Bush's action would do little to force 
Noriega from power. 
</P>
<P>
"We can always hope he will see the error of his ways, and we are looking at 
ways to help convince him to recognize the will of the Panamanian people," 
Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deployment Could Take Week 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it would be acceptable for Noriega to still be in power a month from 
now, Scowcroft said, "I don't see why not." 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of two Army battalions, one Marine company and dozens of armored 
personnel carriers began late Thursday, and the Pentagon said it probably will 
take a week or more to complete. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 months, the United States has been frustrated in its efforts to force 
Noriega from power after his indictment in Florida on drug-trafficking charges.

A woman who claimed that her two infant daughters were abducted by masked

concealing a homicide and obstruction of justice in the death of the first

The charges against Paula Sims, 29, were filed 13 days after she reported that 
her second daughter, 6-week-old Heather Lee, had been abducted by a masked 
gunman. Heather was found dead May 3.

State's Atty. Richard Ringhausen signed a criminal complaint alleging one count

Detroit Mayor Coleman Young almost certainly fathered a baby boy six years ago, 
as alleged in a lawsuit by a former city employee, according to blood test 
results released today.

The results from Edward W. Sparrow Hospital in Lansing show that Young, 70, has 
a 99.99% likelihood of having fathered Joel Loving, now of Fontana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The blood test results were released at a news conference by Noel Keane, 
attorney for Annivory Calvert, a former Detroit assistant director of public 
works who sued Young earlier this year seeking unspecified child support. 
</P>
<P>
Keane said Calvert also wants Young to exercise visitation rights. No date has

BAKER SAYS HE FAILED TO HEAL RIFT OVER MISSILES IN W. GERMAN TALKS

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III today failed to heal a rift with West 
Germany over nuclear missiles, leaving a shadow over the May 29 and 30 summit 
that President Bush will attend with other Western leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had bridged the gap, I would tell you," Baker said after he met with 
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. He said the security of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could be at risk if the allies let their 
nuclear defenses down. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the 15 other NATO nations welcomed in guarded terms 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to unilaterally cut 500 
short-range nuclear weapons. Baker said it was merely a Soviet public relations 
ploy, and Bush's national security adviser said it was designed to split NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Scowcroft, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew to 
Texas for a speech, said the Soviet proposal "is designed principally to create 
problems within the alliance . . . divisions within the Western alliance." 
</P>
<P>
The NATO officials, in a statement after Baker briefed them on his trip earlier 
this week to Moscow, said, "We consider reduction in 500 weapons alone as a 
welcome, positive, but rather modest step." The statement said NATO looks to 
Moscow for further "reductions in its unwarranted superiority." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's dispute with West Germany is over short-range nuclear 
missiles targeted against the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact countries, mostly from 
sites on West German soil. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany wants to delay a proposal to triple the range of the missiles and 
to increase their speed, asking instead that the United States begin to 
negotiate short-range missile cutbacks on both sides with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has opened fissures within the alliance. A majority supports West 
Germany in a position that Baker suggested was partially motivated by politics. 
</P>
<P>
Disarmament feeling is strong in West Germany, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
decision to oppose modernizing the Lance missiles and to urge negotiations is 
viewed as a way of trying to improve his chances for reelection next year. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev complicated Baker's task with an announcement Thursday that the 
Soviets would withdraw 500 nuclear missiles, bombs and artillery shells from 
Eastern Europe this year. 
</P>
<P>
He also advised Baker in a 3 1/2-hour Kremlin meeting that the Warsaw Pact 
would propose at East-West talks in Vienna wide-ranging cutbacks in troops, 
tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the unilateral withdrawal of about 5% of the Soviet short-range 
nuclear arsenal was "quite apparently designed for public opinion" and included 
no guarantee that the missiles would be destroyed.

Israel, for the fourth year in a row, asked the United States today for $3 
billion in yearly aid and U.S. Ambassador William Brown said he feels certain 
it will be granted without political conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shimon Peres asked for the aid at a meeting with Brown. Israel 
receives the largest amount of U.S. foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he does not think the Bush Administration or Congress will use aid 
as a lever to force Israeli concessions in response to the Palestinian uprising 
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the request will probably be approved despite efforts to cut the 
giant U.S. budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is apportioned into $1.2 billion in economic support and $1.8 billion 
in military assistance.

Greece's Supreme Court today upheld an extradition order for a Palestinian 
wanted by the United States in the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over 
Hawaii in which a Japanese teen-ager was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Rashid had appealed a lower court's decision that granted a U.S. 
request for his extradition. Washington considers the case a test of Greece's 
willingness to fight terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"The court rejects Mohammed Rashid's appeal by majority of votes," said Nikos 
Sakelaropoulos, president of the Supreme Court's five-member criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
The final say on whether Rashid is sent to the United States must be made by 
the minister of justice, according to Greek law. It is unlikely that a decision 
will be made before the June 18 general elections, however, and Rashid still 
has time left to serve for crimes prosecuted by Greek authorities.

DOW SOARS 56.82; FEAR OF INFLATION DIMINISHES

Stock prices surged in heavy trading today after a government report on 
wholesale prices eased investor fears about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials surged 56.82 points to settle at a new 
post-crash high of 2,439.70. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 10 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,214 issues up, 353 down and 408 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 221.49 million shares, against 151.62 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index jumped 3.42 to 175.13. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.68 to 348.30. 
</P>
<P>
Prices spurted at the opening as traders shook off the fears that had held the 
market back all week, keeping many players on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The market stabilized at the higher level during the trading session until a 
last-minute buying spree in the final hour pushed prices up further. 
</P>
<P>
Investors decided that the price report meant that inflationary pressures were 
not building, as suggested by last week's unemployment report, and that the 
Federal Reserve might not continue raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear until now was not that the economy would overheat but that inflation 
would rise rapidly and keep the Fed from making moves to ease credit," said 
Michael Metz, technical analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "Now it looks like 
that has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Economists cautioned, however, that despite indications of weakness in some 
areas, the economy is still running at a high rate of activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The number in no way implies that inflation is set to move lower on a 
permanent basis," said James Solloway, director of economic research at Argus 
Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices surged today in one of the strongest rallies of the year, sending 
interest rates sharply lower, because of the wholesale price report. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond was up 2 1/8 points, or about $21.25 per $1,000 
face amount, at midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
its price, tumbled to 8.84% from 9.06% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
That put the long bond yield at its lowest level since early February. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a really powerful rally," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at 
Nikko Securities International. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secondary Market 
</P>
<P>
"People are thinking we are past the bulge in inflation caused by oil prices 
rising. Everybody is perked up and really mesmerized by the idea we might have 
a soft landing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The soft landing many economists are looking for would combine lower inflation 
with a slowdown in economic growth rather than a recession. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were up between 1/2 point and 25/32 point, intermediate maturities advanced by 
between a full point and 1 7/8 points and long-term issues were up as much as 2 
1/4 points, according to the Telerate Inc. financial information service.

WHOLESALE PRICES UP MODEST .4% IN APRIL; 
</P>
<P>
GASOLINE PRICES SOAR; AUTO, FOOD COSTS IN DECLINE

<P>
Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4% in April, despite the sharpest increase 
in energy costs in nearly 2 1/2 years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The gain in the Labor Department's producer price index reflected a steep jump 
in gasoline prices, counterbalanced by a substantial drop in auto prices and 
broad declines in food costs. 
</P>
<P>
It followed a 0.4% gain in March and back-to-back 1% jumps in January and 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the steep rises early in the year, wholesale price inflation, one 
stop short of retail, advanced at a 9% annual rate in the first four months of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very good news . . . but the inflation watch is not over," said Dirk 
Van Dongen, president of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors. "My 
concern is it's dangerous to generalize long-term trends from any 30-day 
snapshot. We still have some sectors in the economy that are hot even though 
some have slowed." 
</P>
<P>
Economists were paying particular attention to the inflation rate for goods 
other than the volatile food and energy categories, which edged down 0.1% in 
April after a 0.3% rise in March. It was the first drop since an identical fall 
in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Decline Since 1987 
</P>
<P>
A 0.6% decline in food costs was the biggest since a 1.1% decline in December, 
1987, and represented the first substantial price relief since last year's 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
The huge 7.2% rise in energy costs matched the increase in January, 1987. 
Energy prices have not risen more sharply in one month in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The energy increase was almost entirely attributable to a 13.4% climb in 
gasoline prices, the steepest since January, 1987. Fuel oil rose a 
comparatively moderate 0.6% after zooming 16.8% in March. Natural gas prices 
advanced 1.9% 
</P>
<P>
The decline in food was led by a 15.9% drop in eggs. Vegetables fell 7.5%; 
pork, 3.6%; fruit, 2.7%, and fish, 1.3%. The prices of turkeys, rice and candy 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop in categories other than food and energy came in autos, where 
prices fell 2.8%, the result of manufacturers' incentives to lure customers 
into showrooms and revive slumping sales. 
</P>
<P>
There were also declines in children's clothing, cosmetics, magazines and 
tires. Prices rose for jewelry and electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation measures earlier in the production process also showed moderation. 
Intermediate goods rose 0.4% in April after a 0.7% jump in March. Crude goods 
rose 0.6% after a 2.3% gain. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the three processing levels would be: finished -- wholesale 
bread; intermediate -- flour, and crude -- wheat. 
</P>
<P>
The 9% annual rate of wholesale inflation so far this year is more than double 
the 4% price rise last year and four times the 2.2% gain in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, are divided over whether inflation will continue 
accelerating later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, acknowledged earlier 
this week that "we may see another bumpy month or two." But he pointed out that 
"the great bulk of the acceleration was due to the increased price of crude 
oil."

People magazine won a round in the battle of the checkout lines when a federal 
judge said a rival magazine designed a copycat cover and must change it. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet issued a preliminary injunction barring Globe 
Communications Corp., which has published Celebrity Plus since January, 1987, 
from using elements of the People cover format. 
</P>
<P>
Time Inc., which owns the 15-year-old magazine, sued last month over the 
People-like lettering and design of the Celebrity Plus cover, even after Globe 
changed the dot over the "i" in Celebrity to a star and added the words "A

<P>
Actors and politicians appealed to the government and property developers today 
to preserve the historic remains of the Rose Playhouse, where some of William 
Shakespeare's plays premiered. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists from the Museum of London digging near the banks of the Thames 
River in Southwark, central London, unearthed important remains of the Rose, 
built in 1587, and want the government to prevent Imry Merchant Properties from 
beginning to build an office tower over the site Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Famous entertainers from the stage and screen turned out today to support the 
effort to preserve the site. 
</P>
<P>
"You're killing yourself. You're destroying your own heritage," said actor 
Dustin Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
Dame Judi Dench, one of Britain's leading Shakespearean actresses, said, 
"There's no other country in the world (where) if they found a theater of 
possibly the greatest playwright in the world that this could happen." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Times of London, actors and playwrights, including Laurence 
Olivier, Tom Stoppard and Derek Jacobi, said, "Surely the secretary of state 
should intervene, even at this last-minute stage, to prevent building from 
proceeding and to save the entire Rose theater site for the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley told reporters today that he had "not 
decided what to do yet."

Sberbank, the largest bank in the Soviet Union with 200 million depositors, has 
begun issuing Visa cards to its customers to replace its traditional passbook 
savings account, Visa International announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Sberbank began issuing the card this week to a select group of 2,000 customers 
for domestic use only. Initially, the customer can use the card to withdraw up 
to 250 rubles a week from automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, the card will be extended to more than 40,000 additional 
customers. Within three years, Sberbank plans to issue up to 5 million Visa 
cards, and the bank's long-term aim is to provide at least half of its 200 
million customers with card-activated accounts.

Becher's Brook, the feared Grand National fence where eight horses have been 
killed in the last 21 years, will be modified before next year's running of the 
famous steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by a public outcry over the deaths of two horses at Becher's in this 
year's race, officials of Britain's Jockey Club said the changes will make the 
fence safer for riders and horses without loss of its intrinsic difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the landing side of the fence will be altered to level off 
the acute backward slope that pulls horses into a ditch if they land short. The 
depth of the water-filled ditch will be reduced by 30 inches, and new running 
rails will be installed on the landing side so that horses can jump straight 
ahead and not be forced to veer across their rivals.

Once he was compared to Magic Johnson, but Lloyd Daniels -- an NBA all-star in 
waiting -- never escaped the city streets where his game first flourished. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels was in critical condition today after a drug-related shooting. (Story 
in Sports Section.) It was the latest episode in a troubled 22-year life that 
has taken him through five high schools, two rehabilitation centers and, 
finally, to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels was shot three times in the neck and torso Thursday in what police said 
was a dispute over an $8 drug debt. 
</P>
<P>
Although his talent helped him receive chance upon chance to straighten out his 
life, it might have aggravated some of his problems, said a close friend of the 
6-foot, 8-inch Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think certain things were overlooked because of his talent," said 
Lou D'Almeida, a basketball fanatic who took Daniels under his wing four years 
ago. "He wasn't required to make any decisions early on." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels also had academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poor Reading Skills 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in 1987, after playing at 
Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, he could read only at a third-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
Time magazine aptly summed up his diploma-less odyssey through five high 
schools in three states: "Each school had availed itself of his talents on the 
court but never managed to solve his profound reading problems." 
</P>
<P>
As he got older, Daniels began making the wrong decisions: He was arrested on a 
drug charge in Nevada. He began drinking heavily. His work habits led to his 
release from two teams within three months last year. 
</P>
<P>
But through the drinking, the drugs, the dropouts, Daniels had one thing to 
hold on to: his game. 
</P>
<P>
At Andrew Jackson High School in New York City, "Sweet Pea" Daniels averaged 
31.2 points, 12.3 rebounds and 10 assists per game -- until quitting in 
February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In a high school all-star game several months later, Daniels limited Sean 
Higgins -- a key performer for champion University of Michigan -- to 8 points 
while pouring in 24 himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as gifted a ballplayer as I've ever seen," said Jerry Tarkanian, head 
coach at college basketball powerhouse UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian compared his overall skills to those of Lakers star Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question, he could have been an NBA all-star every year," Tarkanian 
said.
