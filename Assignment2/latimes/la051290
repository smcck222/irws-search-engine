LAND SWAP BACKERS USE SAME FIRM; 
</P>
<P>

DEVELOPERS' ATTORNEYS IN WASHINGTON TO SIDETRACK TWO OTHER PROJECTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which has drawn fire from some 
environmentalists for its support of a controversial private-for-public land 
exchange, has used the services of the same Washington law firm as the 
developers who are pushing the land exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm of Cutler &amp; Stanfield is representing Potomac Investment 
Associates (PIA), which has proposed exchanging private land for federal 
parkland in Cheeseboro Canyon. The swap, which the conservancy supports, would 
provide access to the Jordan Ranch, where Potomac wants to build a golf course 
and 750 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has since hired Cutler &amp; Stanfield for advice on how to 
sidetrack two other development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
An opponent of the exchange said he was troubled by the relationships. It 
suggests "a chumminess where a professional distance ought to prevail," said 
Siegfried Othmer, a member of the Save the Mountain Park Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"The conservancy should have the discretion not to use a law firm being 
employed by a party, namely PIA, with whom they should be acting at arm's 
length," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston and attorneys with Cutler 
&amp; Stanfield said the relationships did not pose a conflict of interest 
because the firm was giving each party advice on different issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't cross my mind that anyone would" consider it a conflict, Edmiston 
said. "It would raise questions if we deprived ourselves of the best legal 
advice" on derailing the other two projects, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
But a Cutler &amp; Stanfield attorney acknowledged last week that the firm also 
discussed the Jordan Ranch deal with the conservancy, which has joined with 
Potomac in urging the National Park Service, owner of Cheeseboro Canyon, to 
approve the swap. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had conversations on behalf of PIA with the conservancy regarding our 
joint efforts to gain approval of the land-exchange proposal," said Eliot R. 
Cutler, a partner with the firm. He declined to discuss those talks in detail, 
citing attorney-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac wants to acquire 59 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon from the National Park 
Service to build an access road to the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Potomac would deed the Park Service and the conservancy about 1,100 
acres of the Jordan Ranch, including an area of oak meadows and panoramic views 
known as China Flat. Jordan Ranch is now owned by entertainer Bob Hope but is 
under option to Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the exchange have said it would put the Park Service in the role 
of promoting development and would eliminate flickering hopes of public 
acquisition of the entire Jordan Ranch, as envisioned in Park Service plans. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said negotiations leading to the conservancy's support of the 
Cheeseboro-Jordan Ranch exchange were directly with Potomac general partner 
Peter Kyros, rather than with Cutler &amp; Stanfield. 
</P>
<P>
Those negotiations were in effect reopened this spring and ended in a deal 
approved last month under which Hope agreed to transfer about 5,700 acres in 
the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains -- including the 1,100 acres of 
Jordan Ranch -- to parks agencies for a below-market $20 million, so long as 
the Cheeseboro-Jordan Ranch land exchange eventually is approved. The agreement 
has split the ranks of environmentalists, with some lionizing and others 
criticizing the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac hired Cutler &amp; Stanfield about 18 months ago. The conservancy 
retained the firm late last year for advice on a proposed land swap involving 
Elsmere Canyon near Santa Clarita, Edmiston said. He said the firm was retained 
"because they are the premier firm that deals with federal land exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
The Elsmere land, owned by the U.S. Forest Service, has been sought by Los 
Angeles county and city officials for use as a public landfill. They have 
proposed trading other lands adjoining Angeles National Forest to the Forest 
Service for the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy hired the law firm to gain legal ammunition to defeat such a 
transfer if it did not include sufficient environmental trade-offs, including 
agreement by the county to deed the conservancy undeveloped canyons in the 
Santa Monica Mountains for preservation as parks. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy also hired Cutler &amp; Stanfield this spring to find legal 
ways to block a golf course project proposed for Corral Canyon in Malibu, 
Edmiston said. That 339-acre tract was also owned by Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler &amp; Stanfield attorney Peter Kirsch drafted a memo detailing how 
provisions of the Clean Water Act that restrict alteration of stream channels 
could be used to kill the controversial project. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, Edmiston said, was used "to advance the anti-development interest" 
and figured in negotiations with Hope that ended in the sweeping deal, in which 
Hope agreed to abandon the Malibu golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cutler &amp; Stanfield helped the conservancy oppose Hope's Corral 
Canyon interests at the same time the firm advanced his Jordan Ranch interests 
by working for the land exchange, the firm said it had no conflict because its 
clients were the conservancy and Potomac, not Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler, who was associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under 
former President Jimmy Carter, said of the arrangements with the conservancy 
and Potomac: 
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly proper and both clients have been aware of it. We were asked 
by both clients in the beginning . . . to determine if there would be any 
conflict. We did consider that, determined that there was neither the 
appearance nor the fact of a conflict and proceeded on that basis."

THE DROUGHT CONSERVATION; 
</P>
<P>
CAMARILLO JOINS AREA EFFORT TO SAVE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of eastern Camarillo joined their neighbors to the west Friday as 
mandatory water conservation became effective citywide in response to the 
fourth year of a statewide drought. 
</P>
<P>
The Camrosa Water District, which serves most of the eastern half of the city 
of Camarillo, enacted a water conservation ordinance on Tuesday that became 
effective Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Camrosa ordinance carries many of the same restrictions and prohibitions as 
the ordinance passed by the city of Camarillo on April 25. That ordinance 
affected most residents of the western half of the city but excluded Camrosa 
water users. 
</P>
<P>
Both ordinances aim to reduce water consumption by 10%. The two ordinances 
restrict lawn watering during daytime hours when water easily evaporates, 
prohibit washing concrete or allowing outdoor water to run to waste and require 
restaurants to serve water only on request. 
</P>
<P>
It was too early to tell about compliance in the Camrosa district, a 
spokeswoman said, but Camarillo officials said they believe most people are 
doing their best to comply with the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of one man who washed down a driveway on Valle Lindo, random 
drives through Camarillo neighborhoods this week revealed no overt violations 
of the water conservation ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, residents embraced the city's efforts to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshie Kato, who lives with her daughter, Diane Kato, in a new house on Calle 
Higuera, said they turn sprinklers on for only two minutes each evening. They 
use a hose for the areas where the water is likely to run off the sloped lot 
into the street. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking shorter baths and trying not to waste when we cook," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street a few miles, in an older area, Pat Riggins' front lawn had 
turned completely brown. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it out and putting in a lawn with deeper roots that uses less 
water," she said. The Riggins were also installing a different sprinkler system 
that runs on intermittent cycles to prevent water from running onto the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sartin said her son-in-law was installing low-water landscaping at her new 
Sierra Mesa home. 
</P>
<P>
"I also try to make sure my dishwasher is full, and I don't wash the cars as 
much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, such as Councilwoman Sandi Bush, who helped write the water 
ordinance said the three represent the majority of city water users who are 
trying to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the community realizes the seriousness of the drought," Bush said. "So 
if we can cut back at least 10%, which we've been asked to do, hopefully we 
won't have to go to rationing." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District of Los Angeles, which supplies Camrosa and 
other cities and districts in the county with water from Northern California, 
has asked its consumers to cut water use by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The new Camrosa district ordinance differs slightly from the city's. It 
restricts lawn watering only between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. The city 
of Camarillo's restrictions apply from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Camrosa ordinance also allows for two warning notices before penalties are 
imposed. On the third infraction, officials will double the previous month's 
water bill, a minimum of about $6, said Pam Erwin, Camrosa office 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Users who receive their water from the city receive one notice before they are 
fined. Their fines are based on the previous month's bill, a minimum of about 
$9, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Camrosa officials will begin watching for infractions on Monday, Erwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Camarillo has assigned three representatives to enforce the 
ordinance and respond to reports of water waste, said John Elwell, director of 
community services. 
</P>
<P>
Elwell did not have figures on the number of calls the city had received so 
far. Deputies at the Camarillo sheriff's substation said they had responded to 
one call of water wasting under the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The call was for a broken sprinkler head belonging to the city of Camarillo. 
The city promptly fixed the break, Elwell said.

COUNCILWOMAN SAYS DEVELOPER OFFERED 'BRIBE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Oxnard councilwoman on Friday accused an Orange County development company 
of trying to "bribe" her by offering its assistance in passing a utilities tax 
on the June 5 ballot in exchange for her support for a controversial building 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Johs said a representative of Warmington Homes made the offer 
April 2 in an informal meeting on a 77-acre development proposed for the 
northeast corner of Oxnard Boulevard and Gonzales Road. 
</P>
<P>
In that meeting, a Warmington Homes representative offered help from the 
company's public relations firm to help pass Measure C, a proposed 5% utilities 
tax designed to solve the city's financial crisis, Johs said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were offering something to gain a vote, and that to me would be a bribe," 
Johs said. "They wanted my vote on their project." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy Strozier, a planning consultant for Warmington Homes of Costa Mesa, said 
he attended the meeting but never heard anything about the utilities tax. There 
was nothing mentioned in his presence, he said. "If there is any substance to 
the allegation of a bribe, they should go to the city attorney and the police, 
not the press." 
</P>
<P>
The Warmington Homes project, which would include 132 single-family houses, 154 
condominiums and a 4 1/2-acre office complex, received tentative approval from 
the Oxnard City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to amend the city's General Plan so that the project 
could move forward. But the council postponed its final decision until late 
summer by sending the proposal to the city's Planning Commission for further 
review and approval of a zoning change and special use permit. 
</P>
<P>
Johs and Geraldine (Gerry) Furr, who also attended the April 2 meeting, were 
the two council members who opposed the project. The two said they voted 
against the project because they believe that the office complex would create 
too much traffic for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Furr could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a long, hard-fought battle," Strozier said. "We tried to deal with 
this planning issue in a very fair way, and aboveboard. It had its day in 
court. There were three who voted for it and two against," he said. Strozier 
suggested that Johs' allegation amounts to political sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two years, Oxnard has had to dip into reserve funds to avoid 
deficits. The city manager has warned that unless city voters approve the 5% 
utility tax, the city will have to make drastic budget cuts to avoid a 
$2.7-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
One solution, endorsed by the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn. and others, is 
Measure C on the June 5 ballot. The measure would raise an estimated $5 million 
a year by taxing natural gas, electricity, telephone and cable television 
service for most Oxnard residents, exempting low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said she is looking for ways to solve the city's budget crunch but is 
reserving her support for Measure C until she sees the results of an ongoing 
audit of city finances. 
</P>
<P>
As the April 2 meeting with Warmington officials was winding down, Johs said, 
"They wanted to know how we felt about the utilities tax. Then they suggested 
that they could be of great help by getting their PR firm to work on it and 
help it pass. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it felt like they were trying to bribe me," she said. Johs said she 
abruptly got up and left. She said she did not remember the name of the 
Warmington representative who made the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, she reported the incident to John Tooker, Oxnard's assistant 
city manager. But she said she hasn't taken the allegation to the district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
If Warmington Homes wants to support Measure C, she said, the company should 
join the political group, Citizens for Public Safety, established to support 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"They shouldn't have gone through a city councilwoman," she said.

AERIAL SPRAYING IS THE TALK OF THIS TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: REACTIONS IN EL CAJON TO THE MALATHION DECISION RUN THE GAMUT FROM 
ANGER TO ENNUI. MANY WANT MORE INFORMATION. 
</P>

<P>
Judy Heinz ran her hand gingerly along the spanking-new Mercury Cougar that sat 
in the new-car lot in midtown El Cajon. Then she looked up into the sky, as if 
she could almost see the helicopters dumping doses of a sugary mixture of 
malathion on a 16-square-mile area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Right on top of her car lot. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz sells cars. She knows how aerial spraying can stain and dull the finish 
of an automobile. She's seen it happen before. 
</P>
<P>
So don't tell her that pesticide spraying is completely safe. Don't say 
malathion has been safely tested on animals. Those scientists worked in 
well-scrubbed laboratories, Heinz says. They didn't spray the pesticide out of 
helicopters looming over a populated metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
If malathion can do that kind of damage to cars, she reasons, what effect will 
it have on people's bodies -- today and tomorrow? She can't believe that more 
people aren't up in arms about Friday's decision to rain malathion on El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
"This malathion spraying is serious stuff," said the manager at De la Fuente 
Lincoln Mercury. "But most people around here seem to be treating it like it 
was completely safe. That's just so naive. And it's typical of Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"First, they let their air get completely polluted by automobiles. And then 
they sit back blindly while the government further blackens their air with a 
drug that hasn't been totally tested. Just because somebody found two or three 
Mexican fruit flies." 
</P>
<P>
On the day the director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture ordered 
aerial spraying across the heart of El Cajon to combat an infestation of the 
notorious Mexican fruit fly, people all around the city were talking about 
pesticides and mulling a future of breathing in the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
The infestation came to light with the trapping of one male and two egg-bearing 
female Mexflies within a quarter of a mile of one another in a residential 
section of El Cajon, just south of Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural officials say the Mexfly could seriously threaten the 
county's multimillion-dollar agricultural crops without swift and decisive 
action, such as the aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
At gas stations and liquor stores, on front porch stoops and in bank lines, 
strangers on Friday afternoon began asking one another about the spraying. Many 
people had heard about studies being done on rats. Some talked about the 
possibility of deformed fetuses. Most residents, however, admitted they knew 
too little about the pesticide and its possible effects. 
</P>
<P>
Many agreed on one thing: Spraying on the ground, tree to tree, was something 
they could handle. But this talk of an outright aerial attack, spraying the 
chemical from the sky like some bad perfume -- that scared people. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel so uninformed," said Robert Kelleher, who lives on a block where 
one of the flies was found. "I don't mind them walking around and spraying a 
few trees. But it gets me kind of jumpy to think they're going to be dumping 
pesticide from the sky before giving people a little more information." 
</P>
<P>
Hanging from a grapefruit tree in his side yard is one of the hundreds of 
Mexfly traps that government workers have spread around town. The trap is a 
half-gallon glass bottle containing a muddy-looking fluid -- malathion mixed 
with a sugary protein bait to attract the flies. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Carrasco is one of eight certified trappers for the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture. On Friday, he checked more than 50 such traps he has 
planted in fruit trees around town. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't hit much pay dirt. However, he did find a sterile Medfly he says 
probably made its way to San Diego from Los Angeles after being loosed by 
government officials to combat an infestation there. He knew the bug was 
sterile by a telltale red spot between its eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Carrasco said he was frankly surprised he hadn't met with more resistance, more 
hysteria, as he made his rounds to check the traps. He has had to knock on 
doors to notify residents of traps planted in their back yards -- or he's left 
a courtesy notice. Traps placed in front-yard trees can be installed without 
informing the owner, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected more questions," he said as he emptied the brown fluid from one 
trap, looking through a few dead bugs. "But only about half a dozen people have 
even questioned me." 
</P>
<P>
On Fiesta Lane, a small dead-end street where one of the flies was found, the 
reaction to the spraying has been mixed. The neighborhood was quiet Friday 
afternoon. Most people were still at work. When they arrived home, each one 
would find several government notices explaining the spraying process and the 
dangers posed by the Mexflies. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a government worker knocked on Orville James' door and inquired 
whether he minded if his back yard was sprayed. The worker told him to make 
sure his dog, Charlie-Bob, was safely indoors. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, a man with an eerie-looking gas mask walked through his 
yard. That sight made the whole issue sink into Orville James' head. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has two problems," he said. "They have to do something about 
these bugs -- and quick. But there's also the public health to consider. 
They're looking for the common ground." 
</P>
<P>
A few doors away, Antoinette Taylor said she wasn't bothered by the spraying, 
either on the ground or from the air. The Fiesta Lane resident said it's a 
small price to pay to protect the fruit and vegetable industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all for it," she said. "I'd rather have the pesticide than the blasted 
bugs. I mean, my dad used to spray insecticide all the time and I'm still 
alive. And I don't think he took too many precautions. I trust the government 
has the sense to use precautions." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Helling isn't so sure. "I don't have the time to research the last 
600-page manuscript the government has published on the effects of the 
spraying," he said. "I just don't have enough information to make an educated 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"My question is, what has the federal government done for me lately? They 
dropped Agent Orange on our men in Vietnam. To assume that the federal 
government wouldn't hurt us is just naive." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Nelson is another resident who brought Vietnam to mind when he talked 
about the spraying. As he stood outside an El Cajon gas station, waiting for 
mechanics to tune up his white Corvair convertible, Nelson worried that the 
pesticide would worsen his allergy problems. 
</P>
<P>
"For three bugs we're going to endanger the lives of everybody in this town? 
That's ridiculous," he said. "I went through Vietnam and I survived Agent 
Orange. But that was a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was through with all that kind of fear. Now I gotta worry about 
being bombed again in my own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, at De la Fuente Lincoln Mercury and Cadillac, salesman Ralph 
Stewart said he isn't losing any sleep over the prospect. "I could care less," 
he said. "I've sprayed Black Flag around my house with the kids around. And 
that's worse than this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Rick Rodriguez, however, wants to have more of a say in the 
decision-making. "If I were the governor, I wouldn't let them do it," he said. 
"There's other methods. He needs to get community reaction before he takes such 
a drastic step. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we live around here. We're going to feel the effects. I wonder how the 
governor would feel if they were going to do the spraying around his house. I 
bet he'd put a stop to it, that's what. But it's OK to spray in somebody else's 
back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Heinz cringes when she thinks of the malathion filtering down over her 
head, infiltrating the air she breathes. 
</P>
<P>
As the owner of a car dealership in Willman, Minn., in the early 1980s, she 
watched as government officials sprayed the pesticide from airplanes to combat 
the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
"They bombarded the whole area with the stuff and nobody seemed to care," she 
said. In a freak airport accident, some of the malathion leaked out of a plane 
and a few people worried if it would contaminate the ground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of things happen when you deal in dangerous pesticides, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it hurt anybody, but I know what it did to my cars," Heinz 
said. "I'm a real zealot on car paint, and one day I noticed, especially on red 
cars, that the stuff was curdling the paint in little red globs. 
</P>
<P>
"The average Joe might not realize anything is wrong until he goes to sell his 
car -- then he's faced with a $1,000 painting bill. I guess the same could be 
said for your body." 
</P>
<P>
Heinz said she had to have 100 cars on her sales lot repainted after the 
spraying. Then she sued the state of Minnesota for damages, and won her case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the owner here, so I can't say if we'll sue if our cars are damaged by 
the malathion," she said. "But I can tell you one thing: I'm leaving my car in 
the garage on the day they spray. 
</P>
<P>
"On that day, you can bet that I'll be one person taking the bus."

DEFENSE'S WITNESSES SHAKY IN TRAFFIC-ARGUMENT KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The testimony of two defense witnesses in the preliminary hearing of Howard F. 
Barton Jr. backfired Friday when they ended up giving testimony favorable to 
the prosecution while questioned by defense attorney Clyde Munsell. 
</P>
<P>
Munsell subpoenaed William Collins and Patrick Leal, hoping they would testify 
about what he alleged was a pattern of violent behavior by Marco Sanchez on the 
morning of Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, 24, a National City resident, was shot to death by Barton that day in 
the 1000 block of Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach after a traffic altercation 
with Barton's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite testimony from several witnesses who said Barton was the aggressor, 
Munsell is claiming that Barton acted in self-defense. Barton, who is charged 
with murder, was armed with a 9-millimeter handgun. A number of witnesses 
testified that they did not see a weapon in Sanchez's hands. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Collins took the stand, and his testimony was immediately challenged 
by Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Chappell. Munsell countered that Collins' testimony 
was relevant because it would show Sanchez was driving recklessly 30 minutes 
before he was killed by Barton. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Rafael A. Arreola ruled that whatever Collins saw 30 minutes 
before the shooting was irrelevant to the crime Barton is charged with. 
</P>
<P>
However, Arreola said Munsell could ask Collins if he saw a traffic altercation 
between Barton's daughter, Andrea, and Sanchez at Ingraham Street and Grand 
Avenue, which occurred about 15 minutes before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Collins answered that he did not see the beginning of the altercation, but saw 
Andrea Barton speed up in her Trans Am and cut in front of the red Ford that 
Sanchez was driving. 
</P>
<P>
His testimony supported the testimony of Delicia Goodwin, Sanchez's 13-year-old 
sister-in-law, who testified Thursday. Delicia said that Andrea Barton provoked 
the traffic incident, which led to the shooting. A police report said Andrea 
Barton's car stalled at the intersection, backing up traffic. Sanchez's red 
Ford was behind the woman's car. 
</P>
<P>
Delicia was a passenger in Sanchez's car. The teen-ager testified that Andrea 
Barton started her stalled car and sped up after Sanchez went around her and 
pulled suddenly in front of Sanchez, forcing him to swerve to another lane. 
</P>
<P>
Before Collins testified, Munsell told the judge that Collins had seen Sanchez 
force Andrea Barton off the road. Munsell told the judge that Collins was "very 
concerned" about the woman's safety after the near-collision with Sanchez and 
stopped to see if she was all right. 
</P>
<P>
While Munsell was explaining Collins' alleged actions on behalf of Andrea 
Barton, Collins blurted out from the witness stand: 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, you've got two things wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Collins said he did not stop to assist Andrea Barton. Instead, Collins said, he 
stopped at a convenience store across the street from Howard Barton's real 
estate office on Cass Street, where Andrea Barton went after the confrontation 
with Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
"I yelled across the street, 'Are you all OK?' She said, 'Did you see what that 
. . . did?' " Collins testified. 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Andrea Barton left the real estate office and went looking for 
Sanchez. The Bartons found him shopping for shoes inside the Cal Stores on 
Garnet Avenue, where an angry Howard Barton confronted Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
Leal, who was Munsell's other witness, manages the shoe department at the Cal 
Stores. He testified that he saw a heated argument involving the Bartons and 
Sanchez inside the store. Leal said Howard Barton appeared angry and 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my opinion that Barton was the aggressor. . . . He seemed to be the 
loudest and seemed to make aggressive physical gestures at Sanchez," Leal 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Munsell attempted to minimize the damage done by Leal's testimony. He asked the 
witness if he saw Barton hit Sanchez. Leal said Barton never hit Sanchez. 
Sanchez did not argue back and instead looked at Barton and shook his head, 
Leal testified. 
</P>
<P>
Friday proved not to be a good day for Munsell, who is trying to convince the 
judge that Barton was justified in fatally shooting Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney tried Thursday and Friday, without much success, to elicit 
witness testimony to support his theory that Sanchez's state of mind on the day 
of the shooting led to a potential for violence, which put Barton and his 
daughter in imminent danger. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola has expressed doubt that Barton will be able to prove his theory. The 
judge has repeatedly noted the lapse of time between the traffic altercation 
and Sanchez's death. 
</P>
<P>
However, Munsell remains undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he announced plans to put Gloria Sanchez, Sanchez's widow, on the 
stand as a defense witness. The irony of trying to put the victim's widow on 
the stand to give favorable testimony for her husband's killer was not lost on 
some attorneys in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Good luck, Clyde," said one lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The judge asked Munsell what testimony he hoped to elicit from Gloria Sanchez, 
who was not at the shooting scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I will ask her questions which will aid me in assessing Sanchez's driving 
abilities and propensity for erratic driving and potential for violence," 
Munsell said. " . . . I will ask about habits Sanchez had to help me understand 
his bizarre behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Munsell said he also wants to ask Gloria Sanchez about Marco Sanchez's alleged 
use of drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted an angry retort from prosecutor Chappell. She told Arreola that 
Munsell has a copy of Sanchez's toxicology tests, showing that there were no 
drugs or alcohol in his system when he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Sifka, an attorney representing Gloria Sanchez in a $19-million civil 
lawsuit against Howard Barton, told Arreola that she will object to using the 
widow's testimony on grounds of marital privilege and relevance. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola said he will decide Monday if Gloria Sanchez can be forced to testify.

D.A. SAYS SHOOTING BY POLICE IN AUTO-THEFT CASE WAS JUSTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The non-fatal shooting in December of an armed auto-theft suspect by a San 
Diego police officer was ruled justified by the district attorney's office. The 
decision was made public Friday by the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting of Javier Camacho came after he and his brother, Raul Camacho, 
lead a San Diego police officer on a high-speed chase on southbound Interstate 
5. National City police officer Mark Blaha and a Border Patrol agent later 
joined a foot chase of Javier Camacho. It was during the foot chase that Javier 
Camacho was shot once in the buttocks. Each of the three officers fired at 
Javier Camacho, and each had a different type of gun. But, because the bullet 
was not removed from Camacho's buttocks, the district attorney could not 
determine which officer actually hit him. 
</P>
<P>
According to a letter to San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen from Michael R. 
Pent, deputy district attorney: On Dec. 7, the Camacho brothers were in a car 
that had been stolen the night before when they were spotted by a San Diego 
police officer on a downtown street. The men were chased by Police Officer 
Enrique Jemmott when they entered the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
During the chase, Raul Camacho fired about three shots at the Jemmott's car. 
The car drove off the freeway and stopped at an embankment. Javier Camacho ran 
from the car with a revolver in his hand. He was chased by the three officers. 
When he reached a chain-link fence, he ducked behind a tree. The officers 
opened fire and Javier Camacho was shot in the buttocks.

DISTRICT REJECTS YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS

<P>
The Hueneme School District has decided against implementing a year-round 
schedule until at least the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The district, made up of nine elementary and two junior high schools in Oxnard 
and Port Hueneme, has experienced steady growth in enrollment during the past 
three years, climbing from 6,889 in 1986-87 to the present level of 7,150. 
</P>
<P>
District spokesman Don Cody said the student population is expected to grow by 
the 1994-95 school year by only 466 students. He said families with young 
children will probably be unable to afford the area's high cost of housing. 
</P>
<P>
Cody said the district has been able to handle recent growth by utilizing 
portable classrooms. He said four more are expected to be added in 1990-91, 
bringing the district's total to 18. SCOTT LAWRENCE

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CITIZENS GROUP CALLS ON ELY TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens group composed of Simi Valley and Moorpark residents has filed a 
notice of intent to recall Community College Trustee Tom Ely, officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member group filed the notice with the Ventura County Clerk's office 
late Thursday, said Ruth Schepler, who is in charge of the elections division. 
</P>
<P>
Ely now has five days to file a response, which would accompany any recall 
petition, Schepler said. 
</P>
<P>
If the petition is certified, the citizens group would have 160 days to gather 
signatures from 15% of the 66,000 registered voters in the 4th District, she 
said. If 9,900 valid signatures are turned in, the College Board of Trustees 
would be required to hold a special recall election on the November ballot, 
Schepler said. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group demanded Thursday that Ely resign by Monday or face the 
possibility of being recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The group cited "fiscal irresponsibility and unprofessional conduct" on Ely's 
part as the reasons for their action. The group's demand came on the same day 
that faculty leaders of each of Ventura County's three colleges called for 
Ely's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, who has said that he will not resign his trustee post, has been the 
subject of controversy since it was disclosed in March that he had run up 
gambling debts and used his district telephone to call casinos in Nevada.

ATHLETE MAY ENTER NO-CONTEST PLEA

<P>
An attorney for basketball player Allan Leavell said Friday that his client 
will probably plead no contest to punching a referee during a minor-league 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Leavell, the first professional athlete ever to be arrested for striking a 
referee, did not show up in Ventura Municipal Court for his arraignment on a 
battery charge Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, defense attorney Louis Samonsky Jr. asked the court for a continuance, 
which Judge Herbert Curtis III granted. Leavell is expected to enter a plea on 
May 29 to a charge of battery, Samonsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Samonsky said Friday that Leavell "said he'd be up here, but I said there was 
no need to. He gave me the authority to come up and represent him." 
</P>
<P>
Samonsky said Friday that he planned to contact Leavell in Houston and tell him 
that Judge Curtis expects to sentence him to a period of probation and a $500 
fine. The misdemeanor charge of battery carries a maximum penalty of six months 
in jail and a $2,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Leavell was arrested after a Continental Basketball Assn. game between his 
team, the Tulsa Fast Breakers, and the Santa Barbara Islanders at Ventura 
Community College on March 30. 
</P>
<P>
According to the police report, Leavell punched referee Peter Quinn, knocking 
him to the floor, after Quinn made a call against the Fast Breakers in the 
final seconds of the game. Quinn pressed criminal charges. MACK REED

PANEL INVESTIGATES JUDGE IN MANHANDLING OF LAWYER; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRY: JUDGE RAYMOND D. MIRELES ASKED TWO OFFICERS TO "BRING ME A PIECE" OF A 
PUBLIC DEFENDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court judge is under investigation by the state Commission 
on Judicial Performance for giving an order which resulted in two police 
officers dragging a deputy public defender from another judge's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The commission Friday announced an investigation of Judge Raymond D. Mireles, 
46, for a Nov. 6 incident in which Mireles asked two Los Angeles police 
officers appearing as witnesses in a drug case to bring Deputy Public Defender 
Howard C. Waco into his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Mireles jokingly added the officers should "bring me a piece" or 
"body part" of Waco, the attorney for a defendant in Mireles' court. 
</P>
<P>
As shocked courtroom personnel and spectators looked on, the officers burst 
into the other courtroom, grabbed Waco as he waited to make an appearance, 
dragged him down a hall and pushed him through the door of Mireles' courtroom, 
bruising Waco's leg. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials declined to provide details of the investigation or what 
prompted it. 
</P>
<P>
But Waco and the public defender's office had filed a complaint with the 
commission shortly after the incident. Waco said Friday that the commission 
"took heed of my letter and the letters from the private bar on my behalf, to 
see that justice is done." 
</P>
<P>
The commission -- composed of five judges, two lawyers and two laymen -- can 
privately admonish a judge for misconduct or publicly reprove him with his 
permission, said Cynthia Dorfman, the commission's associate counsel. 
</P>
<P>
More serious breaches of conduct are referred to the state Supreme Court with 
recommendations that a judge be publicly censured or removed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing shortly after the incident, the officers apologized to the judge 
from whose courtroom Waco was yanked, and that judge decided not to pursue 
contempt-of-court proceedings against them. The Police Department said that 
henceforth it will turn over such tasks to the bailiffs who are assigned to 
each court. 
</P>
<P>
Waco filed a civil rights suit against Mireles and the officers, but a federal 
judge ruled that Mireles had legal immunity for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Mireles' insistence that he did not mean his remarks to be taken 
literally, the public defender's office launched a campaign to force Mireles' 
reassignment by declaring that its lawyers would no longer appear before him. 
</P>
<P>
Judicial officials declined to transfer Mireles, but took the unusual step of 
reassigning 107 cases in Mireles' courtroom to other judges and assigning 
Mireles only cases in which no public defenders were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Mireles could not be reached for comment.

LAND SWAP BACKERS SHARE LAW FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
PARKS: A NATURE GROUP SUPPORTING THE BOB HOPE LAND EXCHANGE HAS HIRED THE 
DEVELOPERS' ATTORNEYS IN WASHINGTON TO SCUTTLE TWO OTHER PROJECTS. 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which has drawn fire from some 
environmentalists for its support of a controversial private-for-public land 
exchange, has used the services of the same Washington law firm as the 
developers who are pushing the land exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm of Cutler &amp; Stanfield is representing Potomac Investment 
Associates (PIA), which has proposed exchanging private land for federal 
parkland in Cheeseboro Canyon. The swap, which the conservancy supports, would 
provide access to the Jordan Ranch, where Potomac wants to build a golf course 
and 750 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has since hired Cutler &amp; Stanfield for advice on how to 
sidetrack two other development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
An opponent of the exchange said he was troubled by the relationships. It 
suggests "a chumminess where a professional distance ought to prevail," said 
Siegfried Othmer, a member of the Save the Mountain Park Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"The conservancy should have the discretion not to use a law firm being 
employed by a party, namely PIA, with whom they should be acting at arm's 
length," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston and attorneys with Cutler 
&amp; Stanfield said the relationships did not pose a conflict of interest 
because the firm was giving each party advice on different issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't cross my mind that anyone would" consider it a conflict, Edmiston 
said. "It would raise questions if we deprived ourselves of the best legal 
advice" on derailing the other two projects, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
But a Cutler &amp; Stanfield attorney acknowledged last week that the firm also 
discussed the Jordan Ranch deal with the conservancy, which has joined with 
Potomac in urging the National Park Service, owner of Cheeseboro Canyon, to 
approve the swap. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had conversations on behalf of PIA with the conservancy regarding our 
joint efforts to gain approval of the land-exchange proposal," said Eliot R. 
Cutler, a partner with the firm. He declined to discuss those talks in detail, 
citing attorney-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac wants to acquire 59 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon from the National Park 
Service to build an access road to the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Potomac would deed the Park Service and the conservancy about 1,100 
acres of the Jordan Ranch, including an area of oak meadows and panoramic views 
known as China Flat. Jordan Ranch is now owned by entertainer Bob Hope but is 
under option to Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the exchange have said it would put the Park Service in the role 
of promoting development and would eliminate flickering hopes of public 
acquisition of the entire Jordan Ranch, as envisioned in Park Service plans. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said negotiations leading to the conservancy's support of the 
Cheeseboro-Jordan Ranch exchange were directly with Potomac general partner 
Peter Kyros, rather than with Cutler &amp; Stanfield. 
</P>
<P>
Those negotiations were in effect reopened this spring and ended in a deal 
approved last month under which Hope agreed to transfer about 5,700 acres in 
the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains -- including the 1,100 acres of 
Jordan Ranch -- to parks agencies for a below-market $20 million, so long as 
the Cheeseboro-Jordan Ranch land exchange eventually is approved. The agreement 
has split the ranks of environmentalists, with some lionizing and others 
criticizing the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac hired Cutler &amp; Stanfield about 18 months ago. The conservancy 
retained the firm late last year for advice on a proposed land swap involving 
Elsmere Canyon near Santa Clarita, Edmiston said. He said the firm was retained 
"because they are the premier firm that deals with federal land exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
The Elsmere land, owned by the U.S. Forest Service, has been sought by Los 
Angeles county and city officials for use as a public landfill. They have 
proposed trading other lands adjoining Angeles National Forest to the Forest 
Service for the canyon. The conservancy hired the law firm to gain legal 
ammunition to defeat such a transfer if it did not include sufficient 
environmental trade-offs, including agreement by the county to deed the 
conservancy undeveloped canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains for preservation 
as parks. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy also hired Cutler &amp; Stanfield this spring to find legal 
ways to block a golf course project proposed for Corral Canyon in Malibu, 
Edmiston said. That 339-acre tract was also owned by Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler &amp; Stanfield attorney Peter Kirsch drafted a memo detailing how 
provisions of the Clean Water Act that restrict alteration of stream channels 
could be used to kill the controversial project. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, Edmiston said, was used "to advance the anti-development interest" 
and figured in negotiations with Hope that ended in the sweeping deal, in which 
Hope agreed to abandon the Malibu golf course.

Although Cutler &amp; Stanfield helped the conservancy oppose Hope's Corral 
Canyon interests at the same time the firm advanced his Jordan Ranch interests 
by working for the land exchange, the firm said it had no conflict because its 
clients were the conservancy and Potomac, not Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler, who was associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under 
former President Jimmy Carter, said of the arrangements with the conservancy 
and Potomac: "It is perfectly proper and both clients have been aware of it. We 
were asked by both clients in the beginning . . . to determine if there would 
be any conflict. We did consider that, determined that there was neither the 
appearance nor the fact of a conflict and proceeded on that basis."

STATE OKS PLAN TO PUT SLUDGE ON FARMLAND; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE: THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES CAN TRUCK SEWAGE FERTILIZER TO THE ANTELOPE 
VALLEY. ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICIALS SAY IT IS UNSAFE. 
</P>

<P>
The city of Los Angeles has won permission from a state water board to begin 
trucking tons of its sewage sludge to the Antelope Valley for use as farmland 
fertilizer, an environmentally controversial ruling that could open the door to 
more such uses in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-1 decision by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board was a 
major victory for the city, which had sought a cheaper and closer-to-home 
alternative for some of the sludge it has been trucking to farms in Riverside 
County and Yuma, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling marks the first time land application of wet sewage sludge has been 
permitted in the fast-growing Antelope Valley area, and one of only a few times 
it has been permitted anywhere in Los Angeles County, although the practice is 
more common elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Foes of the project called the board's ruling precedent-setting and said it 
could encourage more such efforts. Ron Kettle, a county sanitation official, 
said the decision might encourage the county to try the same approach with 
Lancaster and Palmdale sludge that is now piling up in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the permit, Bio Gro Systems Inc. -- a private company which has the 
contract to transport the city's sludge -- will truck an average of 80 to 100 
tons a day of the city's concentrated sewage to Antelope Valley. It will be 
spread and tilled into the soil of a 640-acre ranch Bio Gro purchased about 10 
miles west of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
That amount represents about 7% of the 1,350 tons of the mud-like waste 
produced by the city each day. Los Angeles formerly dumped it all into Santa 
Monica Bay until the federal government halted the practice on environmental 
grounds in late 1987. Since then, the sludge has gone either to landfills or 
remote farms. 
</P>
<P>
The state board's decision came late Thursday night after a more than 
three-hour public hearing in Lancaster. The water board staff, Los Angeles 
officials and farmers insisted the practice is safe, but local environmental 
and water agency officials remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Los Angeles feels this is not only an environmentally sound 
program, but can be an environmentally beneficial program," said Sheila 
Molyneux, a city sanitation official. She said sludge will improve crop yields 
and reduce the need for scarce water and harmful pesticides and commercial 
fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the water board's action, the city and Bio Gro will be required to 
conduct extensive water and soil sampling, and crops grown with the sludge 
cannot be used for human consumption. A Bio Gro spokeswoman said the sludge 
spreading could begin within several months. 
</P>
<P>
Local activists argued that the sludge could contaminate the ground water and 
pose a health hazard. They also accused Los Angeles of trying to export its 
problems. "If they produce it in L.A., it should be gotten rid of in L.A.," 
said Marty Koppel, director of a local water agency. 
</P>
<P>
Local environmentalists also complained that the board's decision will pave the 
way for the Antelope Valley to become a sludge-dumping ground for Los Angeles. 
City and Bio Gro officials acknowledged they are interested in expanding the 
program but have yet to seek permission to use additional sites. 
</P>
<P>
Bio Gro originally proposed a much larger program involving five Antelope 
Valley sites totaling 3,500 acres and as much as 400 to 500 tons of sludge a 
day. But after that was disclosed in March, all four private farm owners 
involved dropped out, leaving only Bio Gro's farm. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley became even more important to Los Angeles as an outlet 
recently when health officials in Riverside County imposed a temporary halt to 
sludge spreading in Blythe, where Bio Gro had been trucking much of Los 
Angeles' output after some Blythe area residents voiced water contamination 
concerns.

SILBERMAN JURY SELECTION FINALLY YIELDS 12 PEOPLE FOR TRICKY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after it began, jury selection in Richard T. Silberman's 
money-laundering case finally produced 12 people who said they could be fair 
and were chosen Friday to hear the complex case against the prominent San Diego 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The panel includes, among others, a U.S. Postal Service letter sorter, a nurse, 
an insurance company marketing expert, a high school finances clerk and two 
homemakers. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the jurors were seated, U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence 
Irving scheduled opening statements in the case for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., is charged with laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent 
purportedly characterized as the proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
His trial is expected to last six weeks. If convicted, Silberman could be 
sentenced to a maximum of 75 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Though the jury that will vote on the case was picked Friday, it is not certain 
that the case will begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the intense publicity the case has generated has made it 
impossible for Silberman to get a fair trial in the San Diego courts, lead 
defense lawyer James J. Brosnahan renewed a request to move it out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 people in the pool that produced the 12 jurors chosen Friday, 22 knew 
something about the case before they reported for jury duty, Brosnahan said in 
legal papers. Of those 28, 16 knew that Silberman had tried to kill himself in 
a Las Vegas hotel room last February, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of numbers would make it impossible for Silberman to get a fair 
trial because some actual jurors are sure to remember the suicide attempt, 
ignore the evidence at the trial and decide that Silberman must have been 
guilty if he tried to kill himself, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said he will rule on the request Wednesday, after Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor on the case, has a chance to 
formally reply to it. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Irving turned down Brosnahan's first request to move the case. The 
judge said then that he thought he and the lawyers could find 12 unbiased 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Three other men also accused of taking part in the money-laundering scheme with 
Silberman are scheduled to be tried July 25. One of the three, reputed mobster 
Chris Petti, was released Friday from a federal prison where he was sent last 
May after a court finding that he had violated his probation on a bookmaking 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Norman Myers and Darryl Nakatsuka, the two other men scheduled to be tried 
with Petti in July, remain free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth man charged in the scheme, Los Angeles-area investment broker Terry 
Ziegler, pleaded guilty April 10 to one criminal count of violating federal 
currency laws. He is scheduled to be sentenced June 18.

A Ramona physician charged with 23 counts of child molestation and sexual 
exploitation of children, posted bond Friday, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Held on $250,000 bail, Dr. John Byron DeKock, 62, put up $600,000 worth of 
property as collateral late Friday, according to Sheriff's Detective Michael 
Radovich. The conditions of his freedom are strict: DeKock is not allowed 
direct or indirect contact with the victim, the 11-year-old son of DeKock's 
stepson. He is not permitted to practice medicine, and he is forbidden from 
having contact with minors. 
</P>
<P>
DeKock, a registered sex offender who was found guilty of one count of child 
molestation in 1961, has pleaded not guilty.

A 14-year-old boy was in critical condition after accidentally shooting himself 
in the head Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred shortly after midnight in the 3100 block of Clay Avenue 
when Vincent Magana was displaying the revolver to friends in his home, Sgt. 
Scott Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Magana was "showing off the gun." 
</P>
<P>
"His friends told him to put the gun away," Lee said. "Evidently, he put a 
bullet in the chamber and put the gun to his head . . . and it went off." 
</P>
<P>
Magana was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was in the 
intensive-care unit late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police are trying to determine where Magana obtained the .38-caliber revolver, 
Lee said.

U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration's double standard has never been more odious and 
obvious than by its criticism of El Salvador's leaders for their cover-up and 
failure to prosecute those responsible for the killing of the six Jesuit 
priests. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, this same Administration is doing a "soft shoe" on the arrest 
of a Mexican citizen, apparently by the DEA, in Mexico and his removal to the 
United States, all illegal and in violation of Mexican sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
In short, how can we "read my lips" when one talks out of both sides of the 
mouth?

U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial on El Salvador is correct in its focus on the abuse of military 
power. However, your own unquestioned assumption that the U.S. should "lay 
into" El Salvador, that our military advisers should even be trying to 
"professionalize" the Salvadoran armed forces, is the real root of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the military still refuse to "answer to civilian authority?" Because 
70% of all U.S. aid over the past 10 years has gone directly or indirectly to 
the armed forces on top of 40% of El Salvador's own annual budget. After a 
decade of U.S. intervention in a country one-seventh the size of Illinois, the 
per capita income has declined 25%, only 20% of the employable population has 
permanent work, and the armed forces have quintupled in size. 
</P>
<P>
For every single priest who has been murdered, thousands of workers and 
peasants have met the same fate. Torture, disappearance and assassination are 
commonly practiced by the army we support. Instead of laying into El Salvador, 
why not stop all military aid and channel humanitarian assistance through 
reliable international agencies? Conrad has it right. The cross of the 
Salvadoran people is made in the U.S.A.

TURKISH-ARMENIAN CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Levon Marashlian's column "Face Turkey's Crime, Then Go Beyond It" (Commentary, 
April 23) is full of misrepresentations, half-truths and outright 
falsifications. This commentary is an insult to the silent memory of millions 
of Turkish people who died during World War I and to the intelligence of any 
unsuspecting reader. Where shall I begin? 
</P>
<P>
First, the misrepresentations: Armenians would like to draw analogies between 
their civil war experiences in eastern Anatolia during World War I and the 
Jewish Holocaust during World War II. What they conveniently ignore are the 
facts that Jews never established Jewish armies behind German lines in order to 
back stab Germany and establish a Jewish state on German soil. Armenians did 
all that and more in eastern Anatolia! How can the two be the same? 
</P>
<P>
Second, the half-truths: The Armenian writer quotes Adm. Mark Bristol, the 
American envoy to Ankara right after World War I, supposedly acknowledging "the 
cruelties practiced upon the Armenians by Turks acting under official orders. . 
. ." The writer, again conveniently, ignores what Bristol said in his letter 
dated March 28, 1921, addressed to Dr. James L. Barton: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I see that reports are being freely circulated in the United States 
that the Turks massacred thousands of Armenians in the Caucasus. Such reports 
are repeated so many times that it makes my blood boil. The Near East Relief 
have the reports from Yarrow and our own American people which show absolutely 
that such Armenian reports are absolutely false. The circulation of such false 
reports in the United States, without refutation, is an outrage and is 
certainly doing the Armenians more harm than good. I feel that we should 
discourage the Armenians in this kind of work, not only because it is wrong, 
but because they are injuring themselves. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Third, falsifications: Marashlian says: "Under the guise of national security, 
in essence, the White House elevated the interests of corporations . . . above 
moral principles that define America." Whereas the reality is that the Armenian 
agenda and the American agenda don't overlap. Let me be more precise: The 
Armenian agenda and the American agenda clash and contradict with each other. 
American interests are simply better served by letting the scholars and 
historians settle this controversial issue, rather than blindly subscribing to 
Armenian allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the world is taking a closer look at the Armenian allegations and 
studying sources other than those dictated by the Armenian fanatics, we are 
seeing a different picture. That picture is behind the Armenian defeats in the 
U.S. Congress in 1985, 1987, and then twice in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
This time, truth will bulldoze the Armenian exaggerations. Truth has a way of 
doing that, you know!

PROP. 118: CHAOS IN SACRAMENTO; 
</P>
<P>
* DEEPLY FLAWED REAPPORTIONMENT INITIATIVE NO ANSWER TO GERRYMANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most self-appointed reformers who would change the way the state Legislature 
redraws its district boundaries -- and those of U.S. House seats -- seek to 
remove the reapportionment function from the Legislature altogether. Usually, 
they try to create a supposedly nonpartisan commission to do the job. Wary as 
voters may be of the lawmakers revising their own district lines after each 
census, they also have been dubious about the commission idea. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 118, an initiative measure on the June 5 ballot, would attempt to 
reform the system while keeping reapportionment with the Legislature itself. 
But that does not mean it would overcome the Legislature's built-in tendency to 
draw safe new districts that tend to perpetuate members in office. Proposition 
118 is deeply flawed for many reasons and should be rejected by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The major feature of 118 is to require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for 
the approval of any redistricting plan. Presumably this would produce fairness 
by preventing the majority Democrats from drawing lines at will, subject only 
to a governor's veto threat. Proponents argue that Proposition 118 would 
require the Democrats to draw a plan that is fair to Republicans so that it 
could get the GOP votes needed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 118 would not necessarily prevent a gerrymander. One possible 
outcome could be that Republicans will unite to kill any Democratic 
redistricting plan. Or more likely, Democrats will draw enough safe Republican 
districts -- eight or so would do the trick -- that they would attract the GOP 
votes needed to achieve the two-thirds majority. This could create a 
gerrymander as distorted as any drawn under the present system. 
</P>
<P>
Other features of Proposition 118 make it even more cumbersome and likely to 
lead to legislative paralysis. The initiative would give the governor an 
absolute veto, with no opportunity by the Legislature to override. And even if 
a plan got by the governor, it would automatically be submitted to the voters 
at a referendum in the next statewide election. If the referendum failed, the 
whole issue would be thrown into the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The process established by Proposition 118 would almost guarantee constant 
legal uncertainty about the composition of the Legislature. As much as some 
critics attack the record of achievement -- or lack of achievement -- of the 
Legislature under current conditions, the chaotic situation created by 
Proposition 118 might well assure a legislative body virtually incapable of 
legislating.

MILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS PROTEST DECISION TO ADMIT MEN IN 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps someone can explain why: 
</P>
<P>
1) When women are introduced to a previously all-male environment, it is 
termed, in so many words, a victory for women everywhere and a further 
breakdown of the barriers between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
2) When men are introduced to a previously all-female environment we hear 
things such as, "This is a women's institution and we will not accept this," 
and " . . . students fear the arrival of men will destroy what they call the 
nurturing atmosphere at Mills." 
</P>
<P>
Is a nurturing atmosphere a one-sided thing? I can imagine the reaction of 
women if an all-male student body sported T-shirts saying, "Better Dead Than 
Co-Ed."

Although I am slightly Victorian in my dealings with women, I am certainly no 
chauvinist. I see nothing wrong with opening a door, helping a lady on with her 
coat, etc. 
</P>
<P>
I do not disagree with the Equal Rights Amendment women have been pursuing for 
the past however many years. 
</P>
<P>
Are they entitled to a double standard? Is anyone? I think not -- and that is 
why I was so appalled by Carol Tavris' position in "Boys Trample Girls' Turf" 
(Commentary, May 7). 
</P>
<P>
How dare she (and the protesting females at Mills College) take up arms against 
admitting men to the school in an era when the world is moving inexorably 
towards the equality women have sought and deserve.

I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in its last year of being an 
all-male engineering facility and was most disappointed that after four 
grueling years of studying college-level aeronautical engineering, that I had 
just missed the opportunity to have interacted with female students in my 
socially formative teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, it seems wholly appropriate that Ms. Tavris would base her 
tenuous position on convoluted research that was conducted on and relates to 
girls between the ages of 3 and 5 years -- not on mature, rational college-age 
women whose voices are surely being drowned out by arrogant feminists who are 
clearly embracing a double standard on this non-issue.

RAPIST IN DNA TEST CASE GETS 48 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge sentenced a rapist to 48 years in state prison Friday after a trial in 
which a controversial new DNA fingerprinting test was admitted as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett Littleton, 45, of Pacific Beach received the maximum possible sentence 
from Superior Court Judge William Mudd, who also ordered Littleton to pay 
$10,000 to a crime victims restitution fund. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my way . . . I'd never allow you to see the light of day," Mudd said. 
"You are that dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Littleton received consecutive sentences for raping a 25-year-old Pacific Beach 
woman twice and forcing her to engage in oral copulation. Also included in the 
sentence is a 15-year term for Littleton's three prior sex-related convictions 
in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The victim of the September, 1988, attack, who attended Friday's sentencing, 
noted that Littleton was convicted of rape in 1972 and told the judge: "I'm not 
the first person he's raped. He shows no remorse." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the notion that he could be productive (through rehabilitation) is 
ludicrous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd said a probation report characterized Littleton as arrogant. "You took the 
stand and the jury didn't buy it. You, sir, are one extremely dangerous 
person," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd also noted that, in the probation report, Littleton "admitted a habit of 
forcing himself on women." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not capable of meaningful rehabilitation," the judge concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Littleton's lawyer had opposed the introduction of the DNA fingerprinting 
evidence, but Mudd allowed it to be heard by the jury after weeks of hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests showed that semen stains had a strong likelihood of being 
caused by Littleton, and the jurors that convicted him March 8 said the 
evidence provided corroboration to the victim's identification of him. 
</P>
<P>
Littleton's case was the second in San Diego in which such genetic evidence was 
used in a trial and the first in which the defense attorney opposed its use.

WANTED: A PRICELESS GIFT FROM MOTHER;

FAMILY LIFE: WHAT'S BEHIND OUR PARENTS' ENIGMATIC FACADE? FIRST WE'RE TOO YOUNG 
TO KNOW. THEN IT'S TOO LATE TO ASK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOSEPH H. COOPER, Joseph H. Cooper is the editorial counsel for the New 
Yorker. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mothers, please, give your children a gift this Mother's Day. Give the facts of 
your life -- at least some of them, so that your children and theirs will not 
lose you. 
</P>
<P>
I have lost my mother in the sense that she is unable to convey to me the facts 
of her life. She has suffered almost total memory loss; she will be 88 this 
summer. The only evidence of her vitality as a young woman is in photographs, 
undated, of her ice-skating and canoeing, of her on a ship and on a boardwalk. 
Judging by the clothes, the photos are from the 1920s and 1930s. But there 
aren't any notations about the places and the people in the photographs. The 
photos are scraps; there isn't any scrapbook. I wish I knew what she thought 
about and hoped for back then. 
</P>
<P>
A Certificate of Honorable Service from the Army Air Forces 1 Fighter Command 
Aircraft Warning Service says she was "a loyal and faithful volunteer." It is 
dated May, 1944, Mitchell Field, New York. I try to picture her in an airfield 
bunker wearing earphones and moving miniature planes across a map as position 
reports are relayed to her. I try to imagine what it was like. She never talked 
about this service. 
</P>
<P>
The framed photos of my parents have no context. I don't know how they met or 
when they decided to marry. From their marriage certificate (Harrisburg, Pa., 
Aug. 26, 1945) and my father's discharge papers (Indiantown Gap Military 
Reservation, Aug. 24, 1945), I can make a few assumptions. There is no other 
physical evidence at hand. Family and friends are gone. 
</P>
<P>
My father died unexpectedly three years ago. The few times I broached the 
subject of his past, he asked why I wanted to know. I never had a good answer. 
He wasn't given to talking about such things, and my mother, I suspect, took 
her cues from him. And I was shy about probing into my parents' personal lives. 
I didn't imagine they had anything to hide, nothing scandalous or shocking or 
shameful. I was curious but reluctant to pursue matters they had no inclination 
to divulge. By the time I had the courage and clarity to ask my mother about 
her life, her responses were not reliable; they were interesting, and maybe 
revealing, but not reliable. 
</P>
<P>
Did she actually work in her father's tobacco shop in 1915, at the age of 13? 
Did he leave her alone in the shop when he had to make a delivery? Was she 
scared? Did she have to work, and give up school, so her sisters could go on to 
higher education? Did she drive her brother's Pierce-Arrow to a lodge in the 
Poconos for a weekend? And did the young people gathered there come out to the 
front lawn to admire "her" car? What happened to my father's Army uniforms? Did 
she and my father go to Atlantic City for their honeymoon? During labor, in 
Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, was she really seen by a doctor who had 
attended F.D.R.? 
</P>
<P>
I think she went to great lengths for me. Did we walk all the way around the 
field behind our first apartment to get to the convent for music lessons? I 
remember (barely) holding a triangle. How many buses did she and I have to take 
to get me to Cub Scout meetings? 
</P>
<P>
I remember neatly folded T-shirts and towels being packed for overnight camp. 
Or was it for ROTC boot camp? What did she think about when she sewed on my 
name tags? And when she saw me off? Did she wash and iron for every game? Our 
house was always neat and clean. I wonder what she thought about as she did the 
cooking and cleaning, day in and day out. 
</P>
<P>
I have some sense of what she feared for me. I know she worried that my little 
forays into student politics might lead to the rough-and-tumble of real 
political endeavors. I don't know what she imagined for my future. I know she 
worried about my heart being broken. When things didn't go my way at school, in 
sports or at work, she'd console me by saying, "You'll be lucky in love." When 
I wasn't lucky in love, she said that I had a lot to be grateful for. I wonder 
if that was how she viewed her lot in life. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many things about her I would like to know; so many things about 
our family I would like to know; so many things about me as a baby and a little 
boy I wish she could tell me. It was always too soon to ask. Now it is too 
late.

CHULA VISTA MAKES PITCH FOR UC CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State and Chula Vista officials Friday showed off their proposed site for a 
University of California campus on the banks of Lower Otay Lake in an effort to 
garner support for the site. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site, which has been but a twinkle in the eye of Democratic 
Assemblyman Steve Peace for eight years, is in competition with "quite a good 
number" of sites in Southern California, said William Baker, UC vice president 
of budget and university relations, who visited Chula Vista to look at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The UC system is in the process of selecting a site for its 10th campus, to be 
situated in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California. That campus is 
scheduled to be completed by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Board of Regents, which selects the sites, may build another university, 
but will not decide until November if it would be in Northern or Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the population is heavier in the south relative to the north, but, on 
the other hand, there are three campuses down here with great potential to 
grow," Baker said, referring to the UC campuses in Riverside, Irvine and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Peace, who represents a large portion of the South Bay, says a university in 
Chula Vista would give more incentive to the growing ethnic minority population 
in the area to pursue a college education. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids in this community need to see the university," Peace said. "When a kid 
grows up here in the barrios of San Diego, they don't relate to that campus in 
La Jolla (UCSD) that is physically isolated from them." 
</P>
<P>
Baker refrained from giving his support to the site, saying, "It's a fine site 
in a growing area of the state . . . but there are a lot of other sites in the 
running as well." 
</P>
<P>
Baker made a pitch himself, for Proposition 111 on the June ballot, which would 
raise gas taxes to pay for road and highway improvements, and also raise the 
state's spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
"If Proposition 111 fails, we would find our budget short $60 million a year 
every year," Baker said. "Given the current spending limits . . . in order for 
the University of California to grow with the state, we must have some relief."

TWO MEN SOUGHT IN BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies are looking for a man dubbed "The Fridge" and his partner, 
who robbed a Bank of America branch Friday in Vista, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriffs received a call at 6:30 p.m. that two men wearing dark glasses and 
blue baseball caps and shirts had walked into the bank at 330 S. Santa Fe Ave. 
and handed a teller a demand note. 
</P>
<P>
The men escaped with $500. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said one of the men, a 6-foot black man weighing around 220 pounds, 
resembled Chicago Bears football player William "The Refrigerator" Perry. His 
accomplice in the robbery was a 6-foot-4 black male. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the suspect known as "The Fridge" may have also been 
responsible for a Carlsbad bank robbery earlier that afternoon.

FOSTER HOME OVERSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Foster-Home Oversight: A (check) in Every (box)," by Linda 
Blandford, Op-Ed Page, April 10: 
</P>
<P>
Startling revelations, grotesque abuses, program failures and disturbed 
children. These images predominate in media coverage of the foster care system. 
</P>
<P>
As licensing workers, assigned full-time to assess foster parents, we are 
deeply concerned with the care provided by these families. Thus, we were 
pleased that The Times sent a writer to spend a day with the Exposition Park 
Foster Home Licensing Unit. How peculiar, then, was the word portrait she 
painted after her visit! 
</P>
<P>
Blandford's image was of a cold, unfeeling group, striving to avoid any contact 
with an unpleasant reality. From the headline to its ironic closing implication 
that we seek not to see those who would lie, cheat, beat and starve the 
children unfortunately placed in foster care, Blandford's message is clear. If 
we don't see the negative, maybe it will go away. 
</P>
<P>
Her imagery is consistent with this: neat people, boxes are checked, heads bent 
over desks, civil service at peace, etc. 
</P>
<P>
And the staff she describes: an unmarried woman with no children, an overweight 
black woman, a male clown wearing Navajo jewelry, a raw carrot-eating ACLU 
stalwart, and an engineer's wife -- an unguided group turned in on itself. 
</P>
<P>
These superficial impressions were a disservice to readers. Neither we nor the 
foster home licensing system are perfect. But by presenting licensing workers 
as cold, unfeeling bureaucrats, striving doggedly to get through checklists 
while avoiding the realities surrounding us, Blandford missed a great deal: 
</P>
<P>
Foster home licensing is a legally mandated activity. It is also a necessary 
and valuable part of a team effort in which foster parents, foster children, 
and a large government agency are necessarily linked in providing care and 
supervision for children who have been legally removed from the homes of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
With little formal training, modest financial remuneration, and minimal 
institutional support, foster parents on the whole provide the county with a 
remarkably high level of care for the children. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements could be made by raising the modest payments to foster parents, 
and giving them greater training and backup. More licensing staff and lower 
caseloads for licensing workers would enable the system to process new 
applicants faster, give more support to the already-licensed, and make it 
easier to weed out foster parents who don't belong in the system.

ON CAMPUS: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENT OFFICERS SUPPORT CAMPUS RECYCLING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The student government at Cal State Northridge is supporting a proposal to set 
up a campuswide paper, metal, plastic and glass recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
David J. Weiss, the student senator who proposed the program, said this week 
that he hoped recycling would more than pay for itself while reducing the 
university's waste-disposal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to generate enough revenue to maintain the program and for any excess 
to go back to the students through the Associated Students fund," Weiss, 
referring to the campus government, said. 
</P>
<P>
The program will cost about $4,000 to set up and is to be administered by a 
student who will be paid to maintain campus recycling bins and to help educate 
and encourage students to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling bins would be placed in convenient areas on campus that generate 
a large amount of recyclable waste, such as computer rooms, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will go before the Faculty Senate next fall and must be approved 
by President James W. Cleary before it can take effect. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a community recycling center located near campus, but it closed down 
in the 1980s because there was a perceived lack of interest," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, "Recycling is long overdue. It's time for CSUN to be a leader in 
the efforts to recycle again."

<P>
7 STUDENTS WIN DESIGN COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven Woodbury University architecture students won the top award at an 
architectural design competition last weekend at California Polytechnic State 
University at San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank students designed and built a 20-foot-tall, triangular tower with 
free-floating platforms to win the "People's Choice" award in the Poly Royal 
Design Village Competition April 26-29. 
</P>
<P>
One of 63 entries, the unusual structure also won an honorable mention award in 
the "Exploration of Form" category. 
</P>
<P>
The students in the five-year architecture program who participated were 
project designer Craig Rizzo, Eric Hamnerlund, Cole Butler, Perry Roumbos, 
Spencer Knapp, Paul Simpson and Nick Rumanes. 
</P>
<P>
They used chain-link fencing, sewer pipe, wire and wood to build the structure, 
which consisted of platforms suspended from three columns by cables. It was 
capable of sleeping six students. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said the tricky part was that the students did not know where they would 
be asked to set up their structure. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended up having to carry all the materials 2,500 yards and then had to set 
it up in a canyon where the ground was not completely flat," she said. "It took 
us four hours to set up." 
</P>
<P>
Hamnerlund said the structure turned out to be the tallest in the competition 
by 6 to 8 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make a monolithic impression in the minds of all who saw it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The theme, "Exploration of Form," urged students to create a structure not 
based upon accepted architectural concepts.

VETERANS GROUP RECEIVES $250,000 COUNSELING GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnam Veterans of San Diego has received the first in what it hopes will be 
an annual $250,000 family counseling grant, the group announced this week. The 
grant comes out of a trust fund established by chemical companies that 
manufactured herbicides used during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Veterans of San Diego will use its grant to provide counseling 
services, with a special focus on children born with physical disabilities and 
developmental disorders, said Robert Van Keuren, the group's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary mission is to provide direct counseling to veterans and case 
management for the children of veterans," said Dr. Marc Gotbaum, director of 
the new Vietnam Veterans Family Assistance Program. The project will help 
families through the maze of governmental programs offering help for their 
children, Gotbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are initiating a program designed to identify disabled children of Vietnam 
veterans and potentially heal the entire family," said Dr. Jon Nachison, 
clinical supervisor for the program. 
</P>
<P>
The $240-million nationwide trust fund was created in 1984 as an out-of-court 
settlement of a class-action suit filed by Vietnam veterans who claimed that 
exposure to the plant defoliant known as Agent Orange resulted in medical 
problems for them and genetic defects in their children. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cash awards to individual veterans, more than $7 million in 
grant money has been awarded to assistance programs for veterans and their 
children, according to Dennis K. Rhoades, executive director of the private 
Agent Orange Class Assistance Program, which administers the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Veterans of San Diego was founded in 1981.

DAVE DISTEL: USD'S CUNNINGHAM TAKES RAP FOR HIS TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
News Item: John Cunningham, USD's baseball coach, is suspended for three games 
for his "role" in last week's brawl at Nevada Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 When you hear this, you know you have heard it all. 
</P>
<P>
John Cunningham suspended? 
</P>
<P>
Preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
This is no Billy Martin or Zsa Zsa Gabor. This is John Cunningham. This is a 
poodle, not a pit bull. This guy is about as fiery as a bowl of ice cream, and 
I'm definitely not talking baked Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
I could just see Cunningham rolling up his sleeves and taking on the Reno 
bench. Sure. Just like I could see him wearing a lamp shade at a party or 
dancing at Girls' Night Out. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon's nose provoked more controversy in one sniff than Cunningham has 
encountered in his career, and that spans 27 years as USD's coach. I swear, 
this man could drop a watermelon into a hot tub and not make a wave. 
</P>
<P>
Up in Alcala Park, where class and dignity are cherished, this man is an 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, USD plays its baseball games in John Cunningham Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
You think that's no big deal? 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when the stadium was renamed, the university had a little dinner 
for 350 of his closest friends to make the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Cahill, USD's athletic director at the time, said later: "That proves 
that the people here think a lot of him. It's an unwritten law here that nobody 
can have anything named after him unless they die -- or they donate a great 
deal of money." 
</P>
<P>
John Cunningham didn't and doesn't fit either of those criteria. What he has 
given, essentially, is the best part of what has been a very good life. That 
was plenty. 
</P>
<P>
So, you think, now is the time to make the point that the West Coast Conference 
commissioner, Mike Gilleran, should be hanged by his thumbs for such a mindless 
gesture as handing John Cunningham a three-game suspension? 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, USD's players should be hanged by their thumbs for succumbing to 
the mindless intimidation they knew they would encounter when they got to Reno. 
They were the ones who bolted onto the field and did battle with Reno's 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Like it or not, the head coach is the person ultimately responsible for the 
conduct of his team. USD's players put Gilleran into such a position that he 
had to suspend Cunningham, no ifs, ands or buts. 
</P>
<P>
I say this in spite of the fact that I think this whole brouhaha was 
precipitated by Nevada Reno in retaliation for an incident when the teams met 
in San Diego March 9. A Reno player, John DeRicco, was hit in the face when 
USD's Chad Boyd attempted to throw from second to first to complete a double 
play. DeRicco suffered a broken cheek and nose. 
</P>
<P>
Reno's players seemed to get it into their collective psyche that Boyd had done 
this purposefully, even though there was nothing in the history of the rivalry 
to suggest such malice was afoot. Boyd, in fact, was a freshman playing in his 
first game against Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Reno awaited in a rather foul mood. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Jim Dietz, San Diego State's baseball coach, said his team was caught 
up in a backwash of bad blood when it went to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were up there," Dietz recalled, "their players were taunting us and 
yelling at us, 'We're going to get that other San Diego team.' I warned John, 
'Beware when you go up there, because they're crazy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dietz said he will never again take a San Diego State team to Reno, but John 
Cunningham had no choice. USD and Reno happen to play in the same conference. 
The schedule was to bring them together for a single game May 4 and a 
doubleheader May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, likely at the urging of USD's administration, is not commenting on 
the situation, but I can guarantee he warned his team about what it would 
encounter in Reno. I can guarantee he told his players to keep their cool. 
</P>
<P>
Further, before the game, both coaches were warned by the umpires in the 
meeting at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
However, no one could have anticipated that there would come a situation in 
which Chad Boyd would be running at first base and the first baseman would be 
John DeRicco. 
</P>
<P>
Guess what? The pitcher made a pick-off move to first. According to the 
umpires' report to Gilleran, DeRicco, to quote, "placed a hard (underlined in 
the report) tag to the center of the back of Boyd." 
</P>
<P>
This time, the umpires warned the players. 
</P>
<P>
Guess what? The pitcher threw over to first again. The umpires' report said, 
"Boyd lowered his shoulder as he returned to the base contacting DeRicco in the 
chest. As Boyd hit the bag with his left foot, he attempted to use his right 
knee to hit DeRicco in the groin." USD insists Boyd simply swung his right leg 
toward the bag because DeRicco was trying to push him off the base. 
</P>
<P>
This was when all hell broke loose. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the game was canceled, and Cunningham chose to forfeit the 
Saturday doubleheader. After all, you don't walk into a mine field when you 
know it is there. 
</P>
<P>
What happened in Reno should in no way tarnish John Cunningham as a person or a 
coach. It was a case in which, fair or not given the context of the situation, 
the big guy had to take the rap. 
</P>
<P>
And John Cunningham is big enough to handle it.

MORNING BRIEFING: REPRISE OF '88 PLAYOFF COULD BE ILLUMINATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Edmonton Oilers play the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup finals, it 
will be a rematch of the 1988 finals, which were swept by the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
The teams actually played five games, but the fourth game was canceled because 
of a power failure at Boston Garden with the score 3-3 at 16:37 of the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
NHL President John Ziegler announced afterward that the game would be replayed 
two nights later at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted Wayne Gretzky to say of the rescheduled game: "The Americans will 
call it 4-A. We'll call it '4, eh?' " 
</P>
<P>
Add hockey: The original Game 4 in 1988 also was unusual in that it was played 
in a fog that resulted from high temperatures in the Garden. Several times, 
play was delayed as the players skated in circles in an attempt to dissipate 
the moisture. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jari Kurri of the Oilers, a native of Helsinki: "There's a rink in Finland 
that's comparable to this one. They don't play there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What two major league pitchers won at least eight games in every 
season during the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute: Said former West Virginia quarterback Major Harris, drafted in 
the 12th round by the Raiders: "Others drafted higher came out of the woodwork 
and they didn't prove themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Among the quarterbacks drafted ahead of Harris was Andre Ware of Houston, who 
passed for 4,699 yards last season, set 25 other NCAA records and won the 
Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Speed the plow: Harris, who is leaning toward playing for the British Columbia 
Lions of the Canadian Football League, was asked if he felt as if he were being 
farmed out. "They play on a field," he said, "so I guess it's kind of like a 
farm." 
</P>
<P>
Bottom line: General Manager Dick Steinberg of the New York Jets, asked by 
Sports Illustrated about Harris and former Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice, 
who was not drafted: "What you had was 28 scouts who all saw the same thing -- 
that these are two quarterbacks who do not have NFL passing ability or the 
skills to develop into NFL quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago: On May 12, 1970, Ernie Banks of the Chicago Cubs hit his 
500th home run. 
</P>
<P>
Home sweet home: Stuart Gray, traded this season by the Charlotte Hornets to 
the New York Knicks, said of Los Angeles in the Hornets' in-house magazine, 
Tipoff: "The whole attitude about life out there is really cold and callous. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an I-got-mine and you-get-yours attitude. The general perception out 
there is not to help your fellow man." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who undoubtedly will find friendlier folk in New York, played at Kennedy 
High in Granada Hills and at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
For the record: Willie Mays will be 60 next May 6. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Nolan Ryan and Danny Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Billie Jean King, on 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati: "Jennifer's got 
the best ground strokes I've ever seen."

OTHERS SHOULD LEARN FROM LESLIE'S LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisa Leslie of Morningside High has every right to feel frustrated over her 
poor showing on the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
She has been misled and cheated. Her 3.5 grade-point average just does not jibe 
with her 750 SAT score. She had every reason to believe that she was getting a 
good education when she obviously wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
My fear is that there are far too many others like Lisa in the inner city who 
are being shortchanged without even having a clue. To Lisa's teachers: Shame! 
To Lisa: Use your scholarship as a key and work like the devil to catch up and 
excel.

SERIES ON SOUTH AFRICA SHEDS SOME NEW LIGHT ON DARK SPOT IN WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've read with resentment and contempt the past few days about the plight of 
those poor, disillusioned South Africans because they are not allowed to race 
against international competition. 
</P>
<P>
I find their plight amusing compared to the millions of blacks there who are 
oppressed and persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
I also found it amusing that every Afrikaner interviewed (including Zola Budd, 
wonder of wonders) said they were opposed to apartheid. Of course, what else 
would they say? To say they supported it would not do much in the eyes of the 
world to sympathize with them, would it?

CAL LUTHERAN SOFTBALL TEAM BUMPED FROM PLAYOFFS, 11-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unranked Adams State College pounded two Cal Lutheran pitchers for 14 hits and 
eliminated the 11th-ranked Regals from the NAIA Bi-District 2 softball playoffs 
with an 11-8 victory Friday in Alamosa, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Adams State (30-17) advances to the 16-team national championships at the 
University of Western Florida, May 17-19. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran (32-12-2) was seeking its third consecutive trip to the national 
championships. The Regals split two games with Adams State on Thursday, 
winning, 14-1, before losing a 4-3 decision that necessitated the game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kim White was three for four, and DeeAndra Pilkington and Michelle Campos each 
had two hits for Cal Lutheran, the District 3 champion. Pilkington (17-8), who 
pitched all three games in the series, allowed six hits and four earned runs in 
1 1/3 innings, and reliever Leslie Stevens was touched for eight hits and five 
earned runs in 4 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Adams State (Colo.), the surprise winner of the District 7 tournament, erased a 
4-0 deficit with three runs in each of the first three innings. Cal Lutheran, 
which had won 19 of its past 20 games entering postseason play, took advantage 
of five errors to score eight unearned runs.

TRACHSEL BAFFLES CANYONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A flag tap-dancing in the brisk breeze blowing out at College of the Canyons' 
launching pad of a field Friday seemed to portend offensive pyrotechnics, but 
Canyons' flagging offense fizzled altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons was blown away when Fullerton right-hander Steve Trachsel went low and 
away with an effective mix of fastballs, split-finger fastballs and curves. 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel held seventh-seeded Canyons scoreless for 8 2/3 innings, and Fullerton 
defeated the Cougars, 4-2, in the opening game of the state baseball tournament 
Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Trachsel is pretty darn good," Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. "He 
matched up well with our offense. He could just own the outside of the plate 
with that slider. . . . He's a guy you need to go the other way with, and we're 
not very good at that." 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel (9-3), a sophomore right-hander, did not allow an earned run and 
walked two. 
</P>
<P>
He extended the Cougars' scoreless streak to nearly 18 innings before Chris 
Vasquez hit a two-out, two-strike, two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth. 
Canyons (24-14) was blanked in its previous game after having scored in its 
first 36 contests. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez's home run, his seventh, was a high, slicing fly to left with Mike 
Kerber on base. 
</P>
<P>
However, Canyons' bats had been so mute, Vasquez's home run was moot, and 
Trachsel completed his six-hitter two batters later. 
</P>
<P>
If Canyons' offense wasn't doing any damage, its defense certainly was. The 
Cougars committed five errors, but atoned somewhat by erasing six Fullerton 
baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
In the third inning, Fullerton (25-13) scored its first run when a play 
backfired. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons third baseman Jon Beauchemin fielded a ground ball, faked a throw to 
first and pivoted to catch the runner leaning off third. His throw to third 
went awry, though, allowing Willy Speakman to dash home. 
</P>
<P>
Benny Rodriguez, demoted from leadoff to ninth in the batting order, gave 
Fullerton a 2-0 lead with a solo home run in the fifth. He reached base in each 
of his four at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton put together three consecutive singles to score another run in the 
sixth off starter Mike Teich. 
</P>
<P>
Teich (6-3) took the loss after allowing three runs, two earned, and eight hits 
in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Teich did all right. He sort of did what we wanted him to do," said Mohney, 
who added that limiting Fullerton to four runs on a blustery day should have 
been sufficient for his usually potent offense. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Adams opened the seventh in relief of Teich and allowed only one run, a 
ninth-inning home run by former Glendale College player David Weckerle. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons led the Western State Conference with a .360 average in conference play 
but its first five batters were a combined two for 20 and no starter had more 
than one hit. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will play the second game of the best-of-three series at 11 this 
morning today at Canyons and a third game, if necessary, 30 minutes after the 
completion of game two. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow morning becomes a bit of a gut check," Mohney said.

THOUSAND OAKS GIRLS SWIM TO 200 MEDLEY RELAY TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Swim teams from around the Southland barely had finished their traditional 
pre-meet yells Friday night at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach before the Thousand 
Oaks High girls' 200-yard medley relay team made some noise of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Riding the anchor leg of freestyler Mandy Nickoloff, the Lancer girls became 
Southern Section champions, winning the opening race of the 4-A Division swim 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Nickoloff teamed with Sarah Moskowitz (backstroke), Lauren Droshe 
(breaststroke) and Elizabeth Zehr (butterfly) to give the area its only 4-A 
championship. The team raced to an All-American time of 1:49.70. 
</P>
<P>
The win did not come easily for Thousand Oaks in a meet that was dominated by 
Orange County teams. Nickoloff had to overtake Foothill's Libby Kellerman in 
the final leg to give the Lancers the title. Nickoloff admitted that she 
sneaked a peak at Kellerman in the last 25 yards of her 24.02 leg. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary," Nickoloff said of the deficit on the last leg. "It was, more or 
less, I have to win." 
</P>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks girls turned in the best performance among area teams, 
placing fifth with 97 points in the overall standings. Nickoloff took fourth in 
the 50 free (24.38), Droshe won the consolation heat of the 50 free (24.89) and 
took fourth in the 100 backstroke (1:00.22). 
</P>
<P>
Zehr won a consolation heat in the 100 butterfly (59.38), and Moskowitz placed 
third in the 100 backstroke (59.92). Freshman Valery Calkins won a consolation 
heat of the 500 free in 5:03.90. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo junior Lydia Barbie finished third in the 200 individual medley 
(2:07.21) and fifth in the 100 butterfly (58.50) to score 21 of her team's 54 
points. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' meet, Buena's 200 medley relay team took fourth (1:39.30) and 
Royal's Mike Mendoza won the consolation championship in the 50 free in 21.71. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day in the 2-A preliminaries, Agoura junior Jason Stelle broke 
his own Southern Section record in the 100 backstroke, swimming a personal-best 
51.26. He set the previous record of 51.93 at last year's 2-A finals. 
</P>
<P>
Stelle posted the second-best time in the 200 individual medley at 1:56.08, and 
Agoura Coach Mike Mulligan gives Stelle a good chance at winning two titles in 
today's finals. 
</P>
<P>
"He had such a big lead after the backstroke leg, he didn't have anybody to 
push him," Mulligan said. "Still, he's seeded second." 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura boys, who placed fourth last year, might notch another top-five 
finish today. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are led by J. P. Lie, who qualified for the championship final in 
the 100 backstroke and the consolation final in the 200 free. The school's 400 
freestyle relay team is seeded second. 
</P>
<P>
Two Harvard relay teams qualified for the finals -- the 200 medley team is 
seeded second and the 400 freestyle is sixth. Defending Southern Section 
champion Mike Chang qualified for championship final in the 100 butterfly, 
placing fourth in 51.99. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 Saracens qualifying for prelims, however, only Chang and freestyler 
Sean Raymond will swim in today's finals. Raymond placed 12th in the 50 free. 
</P>
<P>
"We started the day well and we finished the day well," Harvard Coach Rich 
Corso said, noting the bookend relay performances. "We just have to be better 
in between. We're struggling. But we're still in there, fighting for a top five 
finish." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale freestyler David Hobbs qualified for the finals in the 50 and 100, and 
fellow freestyler Mike Timpero qualified in the 500. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's Jenny Bissel qualified among the top six in the 200 individual medley 
and the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade's Michele Feigenbaum (200 free, 500 free) and Michele Horsest (200 
IM, 100 breaststroke) qualified along with the 400 free relay team.

</P>
<P>
Disaster always appears to be one pitch away. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez took the championship hopes of the Cal State Northridge baseball team out 
on a ledge with him Friday against Cal State Los Angeles. One false move and 
the title, and its attendant playoff berth, would have gone kerplunk. 
</P>
<P>
All survived. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez bobbed, weaved, allowed 12 hits in the first six innings, yet somehow 
emerged victorious, 9-5, at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (33-20) is 4-0 against Los Angeles this season and another win 
tonight on the Golden Eagles' home field would give the Matadors a share of the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship and the conference's top 
seeding going into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's performance Friday was, in a word, typical. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, was the way in which Northridge manufactured its runs. 
</P>
<P>
In two words: Scott Sharts. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts clouted home runs in his first two at-bats, giving him 24 for the season 
and matching the school's single-season record set by Rondal Rollin in 1980. 
The first, which sailed over a tree beyond the left-field fence, gave CSUN a 
2-0 first-inning lead. The second, a solo shot, was a towering blast -- Sharts 
rarely hits them any other way -- to left-center in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
He added a line-drive double down the left-field line in the eighth inning to 
drive in another run. His four runs batted in gave him 61 for the season and 
moved him ahead of Denny Vigo for the team lead. Vigo, who had a double in five 
at-bats, has 57 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the time of year when guys who are championship caliber step forward," 
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "Scott is that type of player." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Washington is proving to be from the same mold. 
</P>
<P>
With productive Northridge center fielder Greg Shockey out the past two games 
because of a shoulder injury, Washington has filled the void. 
</P>
<P>
In the series opener Thursday, Washington had three hits and threw out a 
runner. On Friday, he reached base three times in four appearances. 
</P>
<P>
With Los Angeles leading, 5-4, in the sixth inning, Washington drilled a 
one-out, two-run home run to left field. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's homer, only his second of the season, was the first hit off Los 
Angeles reliever Rick Burge. 
</P>
<P>
Burge entered the game with none out in the fourth inning and allowed only two 
baserunners -- both on errors -- until Washington connected. After successfully 
pitching away from the first handful of Matador batters, Burge tried to come 
inside with a fastball to Washington and the freshman from Pasadena High pulled 
it down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, meanwhile, allowed only one extra-base hit. Twice, his own defensive 
plays helped him out of jams. 
</P>
<P>
After walking Marty Tourville and hitting Steve Soliz with a pitch to open the 
fourth inning, Lopez made a diving catch of a soft liner off the bat of Dave 
Johnston and started a triple play. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez (9-4) threw to Sharts at first base to double off Soliz. Sharts threw to 
shortstop Mike Solar at second to nail Tourville. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a triple play before, at least not live," Lopez said. "And 
then to start it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Lopez killed another rally with his glove, snagging a shot by 
Kwodwo Brannigan and turning it into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
At the time CSUN was clinging to a 6-5 lead.

CAL LUTHERAN AN INNING AWAY FROM CONFRONTATION WITH AZUSA PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran will have to post three victories today to win the championship of 
the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 baseball tournament 
at Azusa Pacific University. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen were leading Cal Baptist, 9-5, when the game was suspended Friday 
in the top of the ninth because of darkness. Cal Lutheran will have the bases 
loaded with two out when play resumes this morning at 11. 
</P>
<P>
Yet were it not for some heroics from right fielder Blake Babki in a 
second-round game against The Master's earlier in the day, the Kingsmen might 
have been making a trip home instead. 
</P>
<P>
With Cal Lutheran (29-14) leading Master's, 3-2, with two out in the ninth 
inning, Babki gunned down Rick Brady at the plate when he attempted to score 
from second on Sheldon Sparks' single. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping that the ball would get hit to me," said Babki, who caught the 
ball on one bounce before firing to the plate. "I wanted to make a play. I knew 
I was going to get the guy." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the play preserving the victory, Cal Lutheran Coach Rich Hill 
felt that it gave the Kingsmen momentum heading into the Cal Baptist game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great throw," Hill said. "Not just in terms of the physical 
mechanics, but in terms of the timing to end the game. It lifted us." 
</P>
<P>
Should third-seeded Cal Lutheran emerge victorious against Cal Baptist, the 
second-seeded team, the Kingsmen would face No. 1 Azusa Pacific at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen, who lost to Cal Baptist, 10-2, in the opening round Thursday, 
would have to defeat Azusa Pacific (34-10) twice to win the title of the 
double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars defeated Cal Baptist, 1-0, in the other semifinal to advance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even going to look ahead to the championship until this game is 
over," Hill said. "It's going to be hard to win three games in one day." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Cal Lutheran was the recipient of 12 walks and four errors against 
Cal Baptist (35-17). 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-3, in the fourth inning, the Kingsmen took advantage of four walks, 
an error and two wild pitches to score three runs and take a 6-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran extended its lead with two more runs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth -- after three walks, a forceout a and a flyout -- Bryan Lovelace 
was forced home on a bases-loaded walk to increase the Cal Lutheran lead to 
9-5. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Washington belted his 11th homer, a two-run shot, to give the Kingsmen a 
2-0 lead in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin O'Neil (5-3) picked up the win against Master's (26-22), and Mike Rooney, 
a junior transfer from Cal State Northridge, entered in the sixth to earn his 
first save. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen scored all of their runs in the second on singles by Manny Alvarez 
and Bob Farber.

LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO HENNING; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: MINI-CAMP IS A TIME TO THINK GOOD THOUGHTS, AND THE CHARGER COACH SAID A 
NUMBER OF PLAYERS HAVE GIVEN HIM REASON TO DO SO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Henning completed his second mini-camp as Charger coach Friday under gray 
skies but with a sunny outlook. 
</P>
<P>
These are the times for a football team when the glass always is half full. 
</P>
<P>
With no pads, no summer heat and the first cut-down day weeks away, mini-camps 
can be love-ins for the coaches and players. And with the start of the regular 
season 17 weeks away, there is ample room for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to forget about the 6-10 record of last year and concentrate on new 
players and the promise of improvement from the returning veterans. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping in that spirit, here are some players, particularly new ones, who 
caught Henning's eye this week. 
</P>
<P>
A word of caution: The bloom of mini-camp quickly can wilt in the heat of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Junior Seau, first-round inside linebacker from USC: Henning's first 
impression is that Seau is as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't tell if Junior was going harder than anyone else or whether no one 
was blocking him," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jeff Mills, third-round outside linebacker from Nebraska: Although he left 
mini-camp a couple of days early to attend to personal business in New Jersey, 
Mills made an impression when he was here. His value increased when David 
Brandon was lost for the season with a knee injury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of glad we (drafted him) when we did," Henning said. "It wasn't in a 
particular heavy need area, but we didn't feel like there was anyone close to 
him when we took him, and it became a real good pick for us." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Donald Frank, free-agent cornerback from Winston-Salem: Frank has impressed 
Henning, particularly with his speed. He was one of the four fastest players 
during 40-yard dash timing Wednesday. Best yet, he plays a position at which 
the Chargers need depth. 
</P>
<P>
"He is big and fast and strong," Henning said. "He can run; he closes. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is the real thing, if he is what he showed out here on a regular basis 
in camp, he could be better than any guy at that position other than (returning 
starters Sam) Seale and (Gill) Byrd." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Derrick Walker, sixth-round tight end from Michigan: Knee surgery as a 
freshman made Walker somewhat of a medical risk, but Henning said the Chargers 
took him when they were assured that concern was more a matter of how long he 
could play on a reconstructed knee than Walker's ability to compete in the NFL. 
Known for his blocking, Walker impressed Henning with his pass-catching. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm anxious to see him in pads," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walter Wilson, third-round wide receiver from East Carolina: A sprained 
ankle Thursday cut his mini-camp short, but Henning said he liked what he saw 
after Wilson got a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
"Walter Wilson showed enough this week to show he can be a legitimate player at 
wide receiver in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leo Goeas, third-round offensive tackle from Hawaii: Goeas was taken 
highest among five offensive linemen drafted by the Chargers. He might not be 
ready to challenge the starters, but Henning sees a good future. 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly is big enough, strong enough, smart enough," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Craig McEwen, fourth-year H-back acquired as a free agent late last season: 
McEwen joined the team before the 13th game in 1989 and caught five passes in 
the final game. He was with Henning when Henning was an assistant at 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he was not ready for prime time then," Henning said. "But he has shown a 
real veteran, positive approach to the position here. He is an outstanding 
receiver, he does the smart things blocking, and he makes great adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
This is but a partial list of those singled out for attention during Henning's 
mini-camp wrap-up. With 89 players on the roster, there was no shortage of 
candidates to praise. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not to say all is well. Henning did find at least one area for 
concern: A run of minor injuries among the nine wide receivers cut the number 
available to practice, and Henning said depth needed to be added at that 
position before training camp. One possible move, he said, was to switch 
running back J.J. Flannigan, an eighth-round draft choice from Colorado, to 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
The team now moves into informal workouts starting Monday and lasting until 
June 13. That will be followed by a break before the start of training camp 
July 21. Veterans will report a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Although the next month is voluntary, Henning said he expects most players to 
attend most of the sessions, and he had a warning for those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Those players know what my attitude is to that: They better be damn good," 
Henning said. "The young guys, rookies and free agents who take liberties, then 
they are not what we're looking for because they can't compete in training camp 
without a full dose. There is also a tendency for some (veterans) to 
over-handicap themselves and think they have it made, and that isn't looked 
upon well." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The only two players who did not show for any part of the six-day mini-camp 
were inside linebacker Cedric Figaro and outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal. 
Figaro was back at Notre Dame taking classes and O'Neal elected not to come 
because he is a free agent. . . . The next few months will be busy for General 
Manager Bobby Beathard. The Chargers have 31 unsigned players, including 17 
draft choices and 14 free agents.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU ROMPS, MOVES INTO FIRST IN WAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting San Diego State scored eight runs in the fourth inning and six in the 
fifth to build an 18-0 lead against Air Force before umpires called the game 
because of rain. Scott Dennison was five for five with a triple, two doubles 
and five RBIs for SDSU (40-20, 18-7), which moved into first place, a half game 
ahead of Wyoming, in the Western Athletic Conference. Air Force is 25-28, 6-15. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego battled back from a 9-3 deficit, but fell to 
visiting Pepperdine, 9-8, in a West Coast Conference game. Tony Moeder had a 
double and a triple for USD (23-31, 15-16). Pepperdine improved to 34-20, 
21-10. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Powell of Grossmont College has signed with the Montreal Expos and will 
report to the Florida State League (rookie) June 10. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, a 1988 graduate of Patrick Henry High, was drafted by the Boston Red 
Sox out of high school but chose instead to play at Grossmont College, where he 
was the Pacific Coast Conference MVP this year. Powell had a .373 average and 
led the conference with 49 RBIs and 14 home runs. He was drafted as a pitcher 
and power hitter. 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College men's and women's teams were second in the team 
standings after one day of competition in the NAIA District 3 Championships at 
Azusa Pacific. PLNC's men trailed Azusa Pacific, 70-61, while Azusa's women led 
PLNC, 52-34. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC's Rick Penman, of Carlsbad, finished first in 3,000-meter steeplechase 
qualifying race with a time of 9:37.7. PLNC's Sean O'Hara was second. In the 
men's 5,000 meters, Crawford High graduate Goshu Tadese qualified first

SANTANA ROMPS; CADY SETS RBI RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Valhalla's baseball team was within reach of catching Santana, not only Friday 
but in the race for second in the Grossmont 2-A League. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth inning, Valhalla Coach Terry Love watched his team suddenly 
self-destruct, allowing visiting Santana to score 10 runs on the way to a 14-3 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-ranked Santana (19-4, 5-1) clinched second behind Grossmont (23-2, 6-0) 
and pushed Valhalla (13-13-1, 3-4) into third. 
</P>
<P>
Love said he is confident his team would still earn one of the 16 at-large 
playoff bids. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a very good chance," Love said. "We're not a bad team. We've 
played a tough schedule and done well against very good teams." 
</P>
<P>
Santana led, 3-1, going into the sixth, which began with Valhalla's Erik 
Nielsen striking out leadoff hitter Lance McClure. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by: a Chris Hastings single, a balk by Nielsen (Hastings to 
second), a Ross Piper double (Hastings scoring), a Kimo Henson single (Piper 
scoring on error), a Robert Ervin single, the second out, a Gabe Hernandez 
single (scoring Henson) and a Chad Barry walk (loading the bases). 
</P>
<P>
Todd Shaw relieved Nielsen, but it wasn't over. Ferdi Hollis singled, scoring 
Ervin. McClure doubled to score all three runners (after an error) to make it 
10-1. Shaw walked Hastings, and Piper tripled to score two more runs. Shane 
Hobbs, pinch-running for Piper, finished Santana's scoring in the sixth on a 
single by pinch-hitter Drake Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"We just beat ourselves," Love said. "Our shortstop (Rob Reid, who had two 
errors in the sixth and three for the day) had a bad day but, hey, he's only a 
sophomore and inexperienced." 
</P>
<P>
Piper, who also had an RBI triple in the second, went three for four. 
</P>
<P>
In another Grossmont 2-A game: 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont 18, West Hills 3 -- Todd Cady's grand slam in the fourth accounted 
for half of his game-high eight RBIs and lifted his season total to a San Diego 
Section-record 52, surpassing the 47 by Carlsbad's Jeff Meyers in 1988. Cady, a 
junior catcher, went four for six and scored twice. It was Cady's eighth home 
run of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Wynter Phoenix was four for five, with two triples, two RBIs, two runs 
scored and two stolen bases. Second-ranked Grossmont improved to 23-2, 6-0. 
West Hills is 3-21, 0-7. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont 3-A 
</P>
<P>
Helix 2, Monte Vista 1 -- Rob Ippolito (3-5) struck out 13, doubled and scored 
a run as Helix improved to 15-8-1, 4-2. Monte Vista is 17-10, 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills 13, Mt. Miguel 2 -- Jason Gandy hit two two-run homers to lead 
Granite Hills (16-9-1, 3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Palomar League 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 7, Fallbrook 5 -- With RBV trailing, 5-4, with two outs in 
the bottom of the seventh and the count 1-2, Hank Perry smacked a three-run 
homer to win it. The victory improved the Longhorns to 14-10-1, 9-3. RVB is one 
game out of first, tied with Poway, with two games to play. Perry went three 
for three, doubled and drove in four runs. Winner Stan McCarver struck out 
four, gave up three hits and allowed no walks in relief. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen 14, Mt. Carmel 5 -- John Bowerman's grand slam sparked a eight-run 
second inning for host Orange Glen (16-10, 7-5), which put second-ranked Mt. 
Carmel's chances of a league title on hold for at least a game. Bowerman was 
two for four and had four RBIs, and teammate Lance Keller went two for three 
and scored three times. Mt. Carmel fell to 20-5, 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Poway 12, San Dieguito 2 -- Greg Sorrell went three for four, including a 
two-run triple in the first and a two-run homer in the fifth, and had four 
RBIs. Teammate Brock Marsh went two for three for sixth-ranked Poway (17-6-1, 
9-3). San Dieguito is 2-21-1, 1-9-1. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines 3, Vista 0 -- Shaw Henderson (6-5) went the distance for his third 
shutout, striking out five and allowing three hits for Torrey Pines, 11-15, 
2-10. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado League 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual 7, Carlsbad 6 -- Two San Pasqual pitchers walked seven batters in 
the seventh inning and lived to tell about it. San Pasqual starter Tim Young 
(2-1) was relieved after allowing one run in six innings. Ben Duncan homered 
and had four RBIs for San Pasqual (11-10-1, 8-2), which stayed in a first-place 
tie with Oceanside. Bryan Black homered for Carlsbad (9-18, 1-9). 
</P>
<P>
Escondido 6, San Marcos 0 -- Robert Chavez (3-4) lost a no-hitter in the sixth 
for Escondido (12-12, 7-4). Teammate Neil Small went three for four and had 
three RBIs, and Chavez was two for two. San Marcos fell to 12-11, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside 3, Ramona 2 -- Andrew Acevedo (8-1) struck out 11 and drove in a run 
to help his cause. Eighth-ranked Oceanside is 20-7, 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Nonleague 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln 13, El Cajon 4 -- Michael Cagle, Victor Castaneda and Corey Lewis hit 
two-run homers and Donald Anderson went two for three for Lincoln (8-15). 
</P>
<P>
Track and field 
</P>
<P>
Palomar League -- Brent Noon of Fallbrook High officially raised his section 
record in the shotput to 75-feet-2 at the Palomar League finals at Orange Glen 
High. 
</P>
<P>
All other events were held Thursday at MiraCosta College, when Noon set a 
section discus record of 195-9. 
</P>
<P>
Noon's 1990 state and national best in the shotput is 76-2, but it did not 
count as a section mark because it came in a meet in which fewer than the 
required five schools participated. 
</P>
<P>
Noon also has a discus throw of 196-6 in a dual meet, but his 195-9 is the 
official section record, ahead of the 195-8 set by Mt. Miguel's Billy Joe 
Winchester in 1970. LAURA PALMER

FACES . . . : SILVERMAN TAKES HIGH-TECH ROAD BACK TO STAGE IN 'ILLUSION' AT 
LATC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jonathan Silverman is in a play that's very hard to describe. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually tell people it's about a father searching for his son, who goes to a 
sorcerer, who conjures up the son's image . . . yeah, really boring" he 
concedes. Fact is, Pierre Corneille's "The Illusion" (at Los Angeles Theatre 
Center through June 3) is anything but: a lushly landscaped high-tech voyage 
through 17th- and 20th-Century passion, greed, betrayal and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The key word is love -- dangerous love," says Silverman, 23, whose 
swashbuckling lady-killer gets to woo femmes and do sword/gun battle in both 
period costume (including ponytail and no shirt) and contemporary garb. "In 
those days, people would do anything for love. Nowadays, people still do things 
for love -- but we've found ways to get around it. We're a little more sneaky 
now, a little more careful." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he's suffering from an inactive love life. Silverman (who co-starred 
in last year's "A Weekend at Bernie's") credits his dog, a "fabulous cocker 
spaniel named Hank" as his biggest asset in the girl-getting department: "I 
walk down the beach with him -- he's wearing his blue bandanna -- and all the 
girls say, 'Aw, who's that?' " 
</P>
<P>
The actor, who came to fame playing teen-age Eugene Jerome in the stage 
versions of Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs" and "Broadway Bound" (which 
he'll also reprise on film) will forsake the beach girls in June, when he's off 
to New York to film "Life in the Food Chain" (a tentative title), followed by 
"In Deep" in Texas. In-the-can films "Class Action" and "Sketches" are due out 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any lingering identification as Neil Simon's alter-ego, the Beverly 
Hills native takes it in stride. "It could be worse," he kids. "I could be 
doing 'She's the Sheriff.' Instead, I'm having fun playing a studly romantic 
lead -- who gets the girl." JANICE ARKATOV

MURALS AND BILLBOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Allan Parachini's "Panel Does a Double Take, Decides Kruger Work Is Art" 
(May 2), regarding the mural proposed for the Temporary Contemporary Museum, he 
describes Councilman Joel Wachs as "an activist on the City Council in favor of 
ordinances to try to control the proliferation of advertising signs in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
My personal experience with the councilman and his voting record show just the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
In response to my plea to control billboards, the major culprit of urban visual 
pollution, he said he was against it and he voted consistently for the sign 
industry: In 1986 he voted against a proposal to prohibit huge billboard 
supports from overhanging buildings; in 1988 he voted against prohibiting more 
billboards in Los Angeles (the proposal failed by only one vote); and in 1989 
he urged the council to exempt illegal real estate signs in residential 
neighborhoods from crackdowns. 
</P>
<P>
I would be overjoyed if the councilman changed his stand on this issue.

NATIONAL GUARD ACTIONS IN '65 WATTS RIOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike New York, Chicago and other Eastern cities, we Angelenos had not, until 
August of 1965, experienced a major riot, and there had been no warning. 
</P>
<P>
No, then as now, we Sunny Southern Californians were more concerned with the 
beaches, Disneyland or vacations, and the status quo was truly in force. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by Letofsky's article, writer Michael Lazarou appears to have created 
an honest, authentic script. Let's hope the generation born in the last 
quarter-century will take heed and learn the lessons of this historic, tragic 
event, thereby preventing a sequel!

NEA FUNDING COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to Parachini's May 8 report, "More Arts Groups Threaten to Reject NEA 
Money," in which I was quoted, I would like to expand on my position. 
</P>
<P>
My NEA grant was given on the basis of work that was highly critical of U.S. 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
I have no doubt that Sen. Jesse Helms would find my politics "obscene." I will 
continue to write, as I always have, without fear of censorship. I will also 
use my work as a means to be critical of the growing censorship in this 
country. (I've just written a scene in which a theater is not doing any work in 
English at all because the theater's leaders feels that if the NEA can't 
understand the work, it will be less likely to cut off funding.) 
</P>
<P>
I will use my NEA money to write what I feel is true. If it is deemed obscene 
by some, so be it.

'ANY MAN'S DEATH' A SOGGY POLITICAL THRILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Any Man's Death" (AMC Century 14) may not diminish you -- but it won't enrich 
your movie-going life either. This soggy political melodrama -- which takes its 
title from the same John Donne sermon that supplied Hemingway with "For Whom 
the Bell Tolls" -- is set in an Angola desert wilderness, populated with a set 
of walking, running or jeep-driving cliches. 
</P>
<P>
The premise is feeble. A dropout photographer sends his editor a mysterious 
print of a gorgeous girl and a wispy old man. John Savage, as gonzo reporter 
Leon Abrams, is dispatched to unlock the unknown riddle. Since Abrams is a 
drunk recovering from a nervous breakdown -- played by Savage with such a 
repertory of twitches, tics and eye-flutters that he seems on the verge of 
breakdown number two -- this seems odd strategy. 
</P>
<P>
How little we know. Abrams finds everything almost immediately. Soon, we are 
face to face with a cadre of Nazi war criminals -- conducting experiments with 
snake venom: a task which has the cast waving at, killing or menacing each 
other with snakes for much of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The movie keeps reaching for "Salvador" or "Under Fire," but it barely comes up 
with "They Saved Hitler's Brain." As the odious Herr Ganz, Ernest Borgnine 
spits out lines like "Vot iss diss stupidity?" as if he were trying to exorcise 
the ghost of Otto Preminger. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end, William Hickey, playing an ex-Nazi scientist with many secrets, 
appears, and, befitting his long career as a preeminent acting teacher, gives a 
demonstration of consummate hammery: hissing, muttering, yelling, drawling, 
whispering, glowering, holding us as spellbound as a master thespian working 
with the phone book . . . which might have been preferable. Considering the 
fact that Hickey has to say things like "Not even God should be forced to play 
God," this is truly an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
As for the rest of "Any Man's Death" (rated R for language, sex and violence) 
snakes and all, we agree with Borgnine. Vot iss diss stupidity?

VOLCANO SUNS RENEW DINFUL BURMA'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All that noise about all that noise emanating from Seattle's hot Sub Pop 
records seems a tad silly, historically speaking, given the sophisticatedly 
sculpted din made in the early '80s by Boston's late Mission of Burma -- not to 
mention progenitor Iggy Pop. 
</P>
<P>
Both the history and the silliness were acknowledged by bassist Bob Weston of 
the Volcano Suns, a trio led by ex-Burma drummer Peter Prescott, when a fan at 
the Suns' show at Bogart's in Long Beach on Thursday shouted for something by 
Iggy's old Stooges. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," retorted Weston drolly. "Just listen to anything on Sub Pop." 
</P>
<P>
That comment would boil down to mere pique if the Suns weren't a band that can 
walk it like it talks it. The clean-cut, nice-guy look of the trio is reflected 
in the tuneful yet urgent musical style. Prescott's clever melodies and rhythm 
and tempo shifts and David Kleiler's distinctive, accomplished guitar playing 
make complimentary analogies to Husker Du credible. But on Thursday the Suns 
never quite achieved the critical mass promised both in name and legacy. STEVE

THE BEST OF THE '70S LIVES WITH DRAMARAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Drum solo!" announced Dramarama singer John Easdale during the middle of a 
tune titled " '70s TV" Thursday at the Palladium. This is a proper post-punk 
band, so of course the instrumental break was tongue in cheek, and the 
sweat-soaked kids just kept doing the monster-mosh (proving the mocking dictum 
of the opening act, the Dead Milkmen, that "you'll dance to anything"). 
</P>
<P>
"Just like the '70s!" Easdale added at solo's end. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing is, Dramarama is just like the '70s -- mostly in the best possible 
ways. Like the Replacements, these guys grew up on the sensitive pre-punk 
street-rock of Mott the Hoople; an upbeat version of Ian Hunter's tender ballad 
"I Wish I Was Your Mother" was a tasteful complement to their own material, 
which is increasingly reflective and less anthemic. 
</P>
<P>
But it was only the rants, and not the reveries, that worked in concert. 
Easdale, a fine songwriter and capable singer, lacked confidence in his 
distracted frontman role, commanding the hall only when screaming the signature 
tune "Anything, Anything." Likewise, the rest of the quintet brought nothing to 
the uneventful live show that isn't already there and in far better shape on 
the albums. Drum solo aside, of course. CHRIS WILLMAN

SCOTTISH BAND DEL AMITRI TOUGHENS ITS ACT AT ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Del Amitri is a Scottish band with a taste for both Neil Young and its own 
roots (the sinewy rustic nostalgia of "Gasoline Alley"-period Rod Stewart). The 
band also has a strong, soul-pop singer in Justin Currie, and a knack for pop 
hooks neither trendy nor timeless, but that unfold with a comforting 
familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
On the current album "Waking Hours," blandness keeps a lid on things, but at 
the Roxy on Thursday, del Amitri did more than the toughening-up most bands do 
on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The band members also offered an unaffected, engaging spontaneity, hooking up 
with each song as if it were a challenge to be dealt with anew -- you could 
tell from their eye contact and reactions to certain riffs and flourishes that 
they were really listening to each other. But the real attraction of del Amitri 
on stage is lead guitarist Iain Harvie, a wild-eyed messiah figure who looks as 
if he were assigned to the wrong band at roll call. The tension between the 
group's reserve and Harvie's scary intensity was absorbing from start to 
finish. The band plays tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.

REENACTMENTS HELP TELL 'STORY BEHIND THE STORY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story behind "The Story Behind the Story" is that reenactments continue to 
have a life on television. They're the heart of this unevenly entertaining NBC 
special airing at 8 p.m. Sunday on Channels 4, 36 and 39 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kiley and Jane Wallace are the hosts of the program (from the producers 
of NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries"), which fuses actual footage and dramatizations 
in relating obscure sidebars to headline stories. 
</P>
<P>
The last two segments are extremely thin, bordering on vapid. Easily the hour's 
highlight is the story of comics Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill, who had the 
misfortune of making their national debut in 1964 on the same episode of "The 
Ed Sullivan Show" on which the Beatles made their American TV debut. 
</P>
<P>
Even before air time, the comics are in trouble. We see an actor playing 
Sullivan telling actors playing McCall and Brill an hour before the show: "Your 
act just isn't funny." Sullivan has them run through alternate material, from 
which he picks the bits he wants them to do, and then later we see videotape of 
their actual performance that night in front of an unreceptive studio audience 
consisting mostly of frenzied teens primed for the Beatles, not comedy. This a 
very charming piece, with the real McCall and Brill, who are married, 
describing the shattering experience of bombing that night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NBC hour's lead segment adds some interesting edging to the 
story of Abraham Zapruder Jr., the late Dallas businessman whose grainy 
home-movie pictures of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy became a 
lasting visual record of the horror and crucial part of the investigations that 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
How times change. Yesterday a lone movie camera, today a zillion camcorders.

Photo, REALLY BIG SHOW: The highlight of Sunday's "The Story Behind the Story" 
is the tale of comics Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill. They had the misfortune 
of debuting with the Beatles on "The Ed Sullivan Show" in 1964.

DUNNE'S 'PEOPLE' OFFERS A DIVERTING STORY ON NBC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dominick Dunne has risen to eminence as chief chronicler of our social elite. 
He has great eyes and ears for wretched elegance, as witness his Vanity Fair 
pieces on Phyllis McGuire, Candy Spelling and Claus von Bulow. 
</P>
<P>
Dunne reached Boswellian heights with his biting novel on old-money, upscaled 
New York, "People Like Us." People like them were consumed with conjecture over 
who was who. Now it comes to NBC at 9 Sunday and Monday nights. As such 
translations go, rewriters Mart Crowley and Kathleen Shelley simplified the 
intertwisted people and plots to TV taste, but it's still a diverting story, 
with some delicious moments. 
</P>
<P>
Central player is society writer Gus Bailey (played by Ben Gazarra), who is 
obsessed when his daughter's ex-lover-psycho-killer gets a thin prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
(The key curiosity here, as in the book: Gus plots to kill the killer. In real 
life, when the man who killed Dunne's daughter received a short term, did Dunne 
think about a murderous revenge? Is Gus Bailey really Dominick Dunne?) 
</P>
<P>
Gus writes about the richly bored idle class, among them a socialite who 
marries a Jew, much to the impenetrable chagrin of her mother, Lil Artemus, who 
represents ancient wealth. Eva Marie Saint has been getting wimpy roles lately, 
but as Lil she is grandly bitchy and, ultimately, as her world collapses into 
shambles, she is a most poignant image of the perishing breed. It's a singular 
performance, among her very best. IRV LETOFSKY

Where there's smoke, there are firefighters, and in Orange County they are a 
well-trained group of men and women equipped to handle all fire-related 
emergencies, from house fires to high-rise blazes, hazardous materials spills 
to toxic chemical fires. Teams of paramedics (all of whom are certified 
firefighters as well) and paid-per-call volunteer firefighters round out the 
county's fire protection crews. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers listed include the stations in each municipality, sworn 
firefighters (officers, engineers and firefighters), paramedics, fire engines 
and specialized ladder trucks with the 100-foot extensions used to combat 
high-rise fires.

The number of foreign nationals enrolled at Orange County college campuses 
during the last six years has increased steadily, reaching just over the 3,000 
mark in the fall of 1989. That's a 68% increase over the number here in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the county's foreign students opt for four-year institutions, rather 
than junior colleges. In 1984, 76% studied at four-year schools, but that share 
dropped the next year and remained close to 65% until last year, when again it 
moved up over the 70% mark. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine, the leading choice of these students, was home to four in 10 of the 
total in 1984, a ratio that has since averaged only about three in 10 (most 
recently, 33% last year).

STOCKS IGNORE SLOWDOWN, SOAR TO NEAR RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a graphic illustration of the perverse nature of Wall Street, the stock 
market soared Friday in response to signs that the economy is slowing. The Dow 
Jones industrial average, a key indicator of market activity, rose 63.07 to 
close at 2,801.58 -- just 9 points shy of its all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be something of a celebration going on," said Hugh A. Johnson, 
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "The response of the markets has 
bordered on euphoria." 
</P>
<P>
The financial markets were reacting to economic figures released early in the 
day that indicated the economy has slowed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales fell 0.6% in April, the sharpest decline in six months, the 
Commerce Department reported. And producer prices, which were expected to rise 
slightly, fell 0.3% following their 0.2% drop in March, according to the Labor 
Department. Both figures are key indicators of the future direction of 
inflation, which had been rising stubbornly since late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The rising inflation rates had caused the Federal Reserve to tighten credit, 
which pushed interest rates higher and depressed the stock market early in the 
year. Higher interest rates make it more expensive for both consumers and 
companies to borrow, which slows spending and ultimately hurts corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's reaction on Wall Street was made all the more dramatic because the 
recessionary figures were a surprise. Economists previously had expected both 
producer prices and retail sales to rise slightly during the month of April. 
</P>
<P>
"This was World Series surprise time," said Johnson. "The inflation numbers 
were much less than expected, the retail sales numbers were much less than 
expected, and the reaction of the markets was much greater than expected. This 
was a day of surprises." 
</P>
<P>
The bad economic news was taken as a clear signal that the Fed would not raise 
interest rates further. And additional signs of slowing might cause the agency 
to lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
"This means the Fed is definitely not going to raise interest rates," said Jack 
Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "They are 
going to be content to let (rates) stay where they are, and then slowly drop 
over time." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates set off a rally in the bond 
market, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond jumping by about 
$17.50 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
There are also signs that figures on consumer prices, industrial production and 
housing starts, which are all expected out next week, will continue to show a 
weakening economy, said Mark M. Green, economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some investment experts were already saying Friday that the market 
reacted too much. The striking increases in stock and bond prices are probably 
not sustainable over time, said Richard Bernstein, manager of quantitative 
analysis at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"You saw a knee-jerk reaction today to the interest rate speculation," 
Bernstein said. "The question is: Will it go on? Is it the begining of a major 
rally? We don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
Although interest rates always play a key role in the health of the stock 
market, so do corporate profits. And the news on corporate profits continues to 
be negative. Merrill Lynch analysts have been lowering their earnings forecasts 
for the past several months and continue to do so, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas stock markets also posted strong results. Prices closed sharply higher 
Friday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with late buying encouraged by the strength 
of the bond market and the Japanese yen. The key Nikkei average of 225 issues, 
which gained 34.65 points Thursday, surged 531.88 points to close at 31,512.14. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up 18.9 
points at 2,175.9 following the release of better-than-expected British 
inflation figures. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 234.04 million shares, compared to 
158.46 million on Thursday. Friday's trading was the heaviest of the year, 
pushing up prices for a wide range of companies. Advancing issues outnumbered 
decliners by a 4-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for lower interest rates particularly fueled financial stocks, with 
shares of the Federal National Mortgage Corp. rising $2 to $38.75; Citicorp 
climbed $1.125 to close at $23.875 and Great Western Financial Corp. closed up 
87.5 cents at $18.125. 
</P>
<P>
IBM rose $1.625, closing at $114. General Electric climbed 87.5 cents to close 
at $44.25 and Eastman Kodak jumped $1.50, closing at $40.625. 
</P>
<P>
The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 8.18 points to 352.00. The 
NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks rose 4.10 to 192.24. The 
American Stock Exchange index rose 3.58 to 352.50, while the NASDAQ over the 
counter index climbed 4.90 to 438.10.

ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT 'TOO TOUGH,' LUJAN SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: COMMENTS BY THE INTERIOR SECRETARY EVOKE ACCUSATIONS OF 
INSENSITIVITY AND 'WATTISM.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Under mounting pressure to protect the embattled Mt. Graham red squirrel in 
Arizona, the squawfish in Colorado and the spotted owl of the Pacific 
Northwest, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has suggested that Congress take 
a look at the Endangered Species Act to see whether it is unnecessarily 
restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's comments in a copyrighted interview in Friday's Denver Post incited an 
uproar from environmentalists, who interpreted them as a call for weakening the 
federal protection of a host of endangered plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
After an interview at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado, the newspaper 
quoted the secretary as saying that the law "is just too tough," questioning 
whether endangered species must be protected in every locale where they exist, 
and asking: "Do we have to save every subspecies?" 
</P>
<P>
The reaction was swift, with environmentalists accusing the secretary of 
insensitivity and creeping "Wattism," a reference to Ronald Reagan's Interior 
secretary, James G. Watt, who resigned after developing a reputation as 
notoriously anti-environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are incensed that the very Cabinet official whose job it is to be the 
country's front-line protector of endangered wildlife would make such 
outrageous statements," said National Wildlife Federation President Jay D. 
Hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Lujan was quoted as saying that nobody has told him the difference 
between a red squirrel, a black one, or a brown one, and whether we have to 
save every subspecies," Hair added. "I would gladly meet with the secretary to 
provide him with a much-needed education about the importance of biodiversity." 
</P>
<P>
The proximate cause of Lujan's criticism of the act apparently was a fight 
between scientists supporting construction of a $200-million telescope atop Mt. 
Graham in Arizona and environmentalists trying to protect the habitat there of 
100 or so red squirrels confronting extinction. 
</P>
<P>
The squirrels, Lujan said, presented "the best example" of the dilemma 
presented by the act's requirements and the interests of development. "Nobody's 
told me the difference between a red squirrel, a black one, or a brown one," he 
told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing forces in the Arizona struggle have gone to court and two biologists 
for the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service have said in 
depositions that their superiors ordered them to prepare reports stating that 
the squirrels and the telescope could coexist on Mt. Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's complaint that the Endangered Species Act makes no provision for 
economic considerations came during the same week that the Interior Department 
was forced to suspend work on a Western water project because of scientists' 
concern over a protected fish. 
</P>
<P>
The department's Bureau of Reclamation put an indefinite hold on a $589-million 
Colorado reservoir project after scientists for the Fish and Wildlife Service 
concluded it would threaten the survival of the Colorado squawfish, a large 
member of the minnow family. 
</P>
<P>
Some $9 million already had been invested in the $589-million reservoir, which 
is designed to provide water for irrigation, for municipal supplies in 
southwestern Colorado and for Ute Indian tribes. Environmentalists hailed the 
action, but critics ridiculed the protection of a species regarded locally as a 
trash fish. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said the project will be restudied, and he argued that consideration 
should be given to the fact that the squawfish exists in other places far from 
the contested Animas-La Plata project. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours before his Colorado interview, Lujan was asked by San Bernardino 
City Attorney James F. Penman to stop malathion spraying around the city until 
it could be determined whether threatened and endangered species would be 
harmed by the chemical war on Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan declined, and an Interior Department spokesman called Freeman's request 
an attempt to make political use of the act. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Goldstein, Lujan's press secretary, denied Friday that the secretary was 
calling for a weakening of the Endangered Species Act, saying he was expressing 
mounting frustrations caused by efforts to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary, he said, is concerned that the law is being misused to block 
economic development. Rather than calling for a weakening of it, Goldstein 
said, Lujan would like Congress to review how it applies to the protection of 
subspecies and officially endangered species that exist in more than one 
locale. 
</P>
<P>
"He is suggesting," Goldstein said, "that Congress might want to examine it to 
determine whether it is being implemented for the purpose for which it was 
intended." 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's remarks seemed certain to add fuel to the already furious debate over 
protection of the spotted owl in Washington, Oregon and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and timber interests have battled over the issue of 
restricting logging in century-old forests that provide the habitat of the 
1,500 pair of breeding owls still believed to exist. 
</P>
<P>
The spotted owl currently is not listed as endangered, but a study by the Fish 
and Wildlife Service has been under way for months. An announcement is expected 
next month on whether the owl will be put on the list, a move that timber 
interests contend would have massive economic repercussions.

WOMAN RAPED AT BEACH IN BROAD DAYLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN and JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police investigators were frustrated Friday in their search for witnesses to a 
daytime rape of a USC student that lasted for more than an hour this week in 
plain view on an open stretch of Santa Monica Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The rape, which occurred Wednesday north of the Santa Monica Pier, began when a 
man approached a 22-year-old woman who was sunbathing. The man jabbed a sharp 
object in her back and threatened her into cooperating with the attack, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
People were walking, jogging and bicycling nearby and probably saw the two, but 
no one attempted to summon help -- possibly because they were unaware that a 
rape was taking place, Santa Monica Police Lt. Robert Thomas said. Unable to 
fight off her attacker and because the man was armed, the woman was not 
screaming or struggling visibly. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds on Wednesday afternoon were sparse because of the cool weather and 
strong offshore winds, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was so scared because he had told her that he had killed three women," 
Thomas said. "(The attacker) was just lucky nobody was walking by closer." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said "every officer is aware of this crime, and they will be looking 
more carefully for the suspect." But so far no witnesses have come forward and 
police have been stymied in their search for the attacker, described as a 
dark-complected Filipino man, 25 to 30 years old, about 5 feet, 6 inches tall, 
with dark hair. He weighs 150 to 160 pounds, police said, and wore a striped 
shirt and dark pants. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told police she did not think the attacker was a transient, although 
she thought he had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas declined to elaborate on the victim's condition. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said witnesses may have passed within 75 yards of the attack, which 
occurred not far from a paved bicycle path in an area where the beach is 300 to 
400 yards wide. 
</P>
<P>
"This is normally a safe beach because it is so wide open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people calling us all the time and asking us if it is safe for a 
single woman to (lie) out on the beach," Thomas said. "We've said we've never 
had any problems before. Of course, we can't say that any more." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the second known case of sexual assault at Santa Monica Beach 
since October, when a 28-year-old Santa Monica woman was choked and sexually 
assaulted around noon south of the pier by a transient wielding a knife. The 
woman screamed during the attack, but nobody came to her rescue. There have 
been no arrests in that case and police have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Some Santa Monica residents, increasingly concerned about crime, seized that 
case as an example of a need to crack down on the city's transients. A rally in 
April drew a crowd of about 150 who complained that City Atty. Robert M. Myers 
was lenient with homeless people who slept in parks or on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Wednesday's rape was perhaps more shocking than the one in October 
because it occurred on a vast, open stretch of beach where there is nowhere to 
hide, such as behind the trees or bushes south of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas said Santa Monica police are not deploying additional officers to 
the beach in the wake of the attack. "We just don't have the manpower," the 
lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
Rape experts at Los Angeles-based crisis centers described the attack as 
unusual but not without precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Jennie Balise, an intervention services coordinator for the Los Angeles 
Commission on Assaults against Women, said that organization's hot line 
receives 800 to 1,000 calls a month from rape victims or their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Although most such calls involve rapes that occur indoors and rapes perpetrated 
by acquaintances of the victims, a surprising number begin or actually take 
place in public settings such as beaches, parks or shopping mall parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing is certainly not unheard of," Balise said. "My belief is it 
has happened plenty of times before." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's incident occurred about 4:30 p.m. near the 1200 block of the 
Promenade, a concrete walkway that runs next to the bike path. The walkway is 
about 100 yards from where the rape took place, Thomas said, and anyone walking 
there "probably thought it was just a couple making out." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the attacker approached the woman and instructed her to "act like 
we're friends." He then sexually assaulted her repeatedly -- penetrating her 
with his fingers -- until about 6 p.m., when she was able to escape and call 
police. Officials said the act constitutes rape under state law. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Dan Cromp described the afternoon of the 
attack as a typical slow, cool spring day with strong afternoon sea breezes and 
scattered crowds. He said a lifeguard tower near the water was manned, but 
lifeguards were not notified of the rape until about 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"No witnesses have come forward -- it was a reasonably slow day," Cromp said. 
"Of course, we're obviously on the lookout for him." 
</P>
<P>
The wide expanse of beach was almost empty Friday despite sunny weather and 
warm breezes coming off the ocean. A smattering of beachgoers, and lifeguard 
Lane Murphy, all said they were surprised and disturbed that such an attack 
could occur in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a disturbing thing," Murphy said. He said that the two lifeguard 
towers in the area are about 200 feet apart and that it is hard for lifeguards 
to see the entire beach, particularly the areas behind the towers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is ridiculous," said Lilly Djusic, 23, of West Los Angeles, who was 
sunning herself alone at the beach. "You can't even sit alone on the beach? I 
wouldn't even dream of (such an attack) happening here. I think it's pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
Dubi Paz, manager of Perry's Pizza &amp; More, a food stand facing the 
Promenade, said he was there Wednesday but the beach was nearly "deserted" and 
he didn't see anything unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a big beach; it's hard to see all the way across," Paz said. " . . . 
We didn't see a commotion. If there is one, we usually call the police right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," he added. "I can't believe it."

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush entered the increasingly anxious public debate over the federal 
budget deficit Friday, conceding that he does not know whether it can be curbed 
without increasing taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But in his first public comments on the controversy since the White House and 
Congress began highly visible maneuvering last Sunday over the deficit, Bush 
insisted that he is imposing no conditions on budget negotiations that begin at 
the White House next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The President's comments, made at the start of a two-day trip to Texas, South 
Carolina and Virginia, followed by one day the publication of remarks by his 
chief of staff, John H. Sununu, who insisted that the White House would reject 
any effort to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of Sununu's comments was to inflame uneasy congressional Democrats, 
who had grown increasingly fearful that the budget negotiations would become a 
political trap in which the White House would position itself as the opponent 
of unpopular tax increases proposed by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), who was traveling with Bush, said he believes 
the so-called budget summit is "on track -- as long as we keep these fellows in 
line who are trying to redefine it." Bentsen is chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee and will participate in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and congressional leaders agreed last Sunday to begin the private talks on 
the ballooning budget deficit in the wake of rising interest rates, a recent 
increase in unemployment and predictions that government revenues in fiscal 
1991 will be lower than anticipated. By seeking to work out a joint solution to 
the untamed deficit, Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate and the 
Republican White House hope they can avoid political pitfalls or at least share 
the blame if unpopular choices must be made. 
</P>
<P>
Without an agreement to boost government revenue, trim spending, or both, 
Budget Director Richard G. Darman has warned, severe across-the-board spending 
cuts will be imposed on the federal budget to bring the fiscal 1991 deficit to 
$64 billion as required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law. 
</P>
<P>
Darman has estimated that, in the absence of reduced spending and greater 
government income, that target could be missed by as much as $100 billion in a 
$1.2-trillion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the budget must be balanced by fiscal 1993, which 
begins on Oct. 1, 1992. Specific, decreasing deficit targets must be met each 
year along the way. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement last Sunday that there would be no "preconditions" in the 
budget talks was widely interpreted as a signal that Bush might be willing to 
retreat from his 1988 campaign pledge of "no new taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Senior White House officials sent out multiple signals -- some saying that "no 
preconditions" meant Bush was open-minded on the subject, while others urged 
caution in interpreting it to mean a tax hike is on the way. And conservative 
Republicans urged Bush to stand firm in opposing higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
After remaining publicly silent on the matter all week, Bush at first sought to 
duck any response Friday, telling reporters: "You can come at me all day long." 
</P>
<P>
But, pressed about whether there was any way to balance the budget without 
increasing revenues, he acknowledged that he is uncertain, and he made no 
mention of his opposition to tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
"See what happens. We just don't know. Go there; go there and discuss 
everything," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
With the controversy over the deficit and possible tax hikes showing no sign of 
abating, Bush called for calm -- and adherence to the negotiation ground rules: 
An open mind to all approaches to bring down the deficit but secrecy in the 
conduct of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't contribute to it if I start telling about my approach or what I think 
is the right way to do it, try to dictate to anybody. But I'll be there with no 
preconditions," he said, after approaching reporters even before Air Force One 
was airborne at the start of the journey to Kingsville, where Bush spoke at 
Texas A&amp;I University. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't react to every charge and countercharge or some flamboyant 
congressman up there blasting away at me," Bush said. "I don't think that's the 
way a President should conduct himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave, so keep your snorkel above the water 
level and do what you think is right. That's exactly what my mom told me when I 
was about 6. Do your best. Do your best. I'm trying hard. Stay calm." 
</P>
<P>
But despite such advice, the President seemed peeved at repeated questions 
about the likelihood of a tax increase -- a step that would place him in the 
politically difficult position of making a public retreat from the centerpiece 
of his 1988 campaign just before the 1990 congressional elections 
</P>
<P>
Bush also appeared bothered by a suggestion that Sununu was in trouble as a 
result of the comments the chief of staff made on the President's unwillingness 
to recommend a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"That's silly. So stupid," Bush said, adding that his congressional critics are 
not "in trouble either."

The Polish government scolded Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Friday for his 
criticism of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's reform program, saying 
"exposure of political differences does not serve the interests of the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
The remarks by government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska came a day after 
Walesa attacked the government for failing to address the concerns of workers 
in the Gdansk shipyard, where the Solidarity union was born in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange was part of a growing tiff between Mazowiecki, the head of the 
Solidarity-led government, and Walesa, the trade union chief, about how the 
country should be governed. 
</P>
<P>
In the southwestern industrial center of Katowice, meanwhile, 50 right-wing 
activists took over the headquarters of regional Polish television and radio, 
which is controlled by the Solidarity government. The protesters, members of 
the nationalistic Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN), walked 
peacefully into the headquarters and occupied the building to press demands for 
greater access by opposition groups to the media. 
</P>
<P>
KPN leader Adam Slomka was meeting with regional governor Tadeusz Wnuk on the 
matter, a KPN spokesman said in Katowice. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to protest the monopoly of the Solidarity communistic government on 
the media," the spokesman said, referring to last year's round-table 
arrangement allowing the Communists to retain some posts in the government. 
</P>
<P>
The latest tiff between Walesa and the government erupted Thursday when the 
union leader supported a brief strike at the Gdansk shipyard by workers 
concerned about low wages. Walesa lashed out at the government for choosing 
"the wrong version" of democracy, which he said is not allowing individuals 
their full liberties within the law. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa also has demanded that Communists be ousted from positions that permit 
them to control various sectors of the economy.

One of the three leading parties walked out of Romania's makeshift Parliament 
Friday to protest recent violent attacks on opposition leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The National Peasants Party's pullout symbolized the growing tension before 
Romania's first free elections in more than 40 years, planned for May 20. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-government protesters seeking the resignation of former Communists, 
including interim President Ion Iliescu, demonstrated for the 20th straight day 
in downtown Bucharest. About 5,000 government supporters rallied a half-mile 
away. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the United States announced that it was recalling its ambassador, 
Alan Green Jr., because of concerns that the elections will not be entirely 
free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
As Green left for Washington Friday, Western diplomats said the Romanian 
government was embarrassed and angered by the recall. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Petre Roman said Green had questioned him during a meeting four 
or five days ago about incidents during the electoral campaign and candidates' 
access to the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
"We parted on cordial terms. The American action is in contradiction with the 
discussion I had (with the ambassador)," Roman told Reuters news service. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said in a statement broadcast by Romanian Radio that Green 
will return to Bucharest before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
At a Friday session of Romania's Provisional Council of National Unity, the 
interim Parliament, Ion Diaconescu, vice president of the Peasants Party, said 
his group is withdrawing its three deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Two other deputies joined the Peasants Party in the pullout. It was prompted by 
opposition accusations that the dominant National Salvation Front is behind 
recent attacks on its opponents and is using its leading position to manipulate 
state funds and the media. 
</P>
<P>
In an afternoon session, Parliament scrapped a 1978 decree that placed the 
state radio and television under government control.

<P>
Leaders of French left- and extreme right-wing political parties accused each 
other Friday of responsibility for the ghoulish desecration of a historic 
Jewish cemetery in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Jewish leaders, anti-racism activists and families with relatives 
buried at the cemetery in Carpentras, near the city of Avignon, gathered Friday 
for ceremonies all over France to pray for understanding and condemn the 
graveyard vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly suspended its session for 15 minutes to protest 
the attack. "Nothing can express, with all the force that is needed, our 
feelings of horror," said Georges Hage, the Communist Speaker of the lower 
house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The town council of Carpentras voted to observe five minutes of total silence 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Michel Rocard, a Protestant, attended the Sabbath service at a 
synagogue in central Paris to express his sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
According to the police, a group of at least four people, driving two vehicles 
and carrying crowbars and other heavy tools, systematically desecrated and 
mutilated 34 graves, marking headstones with swastikas and, in one case, 
impaling a recently buried corpse on the handle of an umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
Carpentras police inspector Roland Magnet said he received a call from an 
Arabic-speaking person claiming to represent a group called "Mohammed El 
Boukina" and taking responsibility for the attack. However, most of the 
investigation Friday appeared to be focused on right-wing or neo-Nazi 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Police also said they held for questioning a French skinhead, a neo-Nazi 
extremist, in connection with the incident. The unidentified man was arrested 
Friday afternoon in Avignon, about 20 miles to the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proceeding with verifications," a police officer said. "One must not 
make hasty conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth and most serious attack on Jewish cemeteries in France in 
little more than four years. Jewish leaders, including Nobel peace laureate 
Elie Wiesel, who left a dinner party opening the Cannes film festival to visit 
the Carpentras cemetery Friday, said the attack reflected a growing atmosphere 
of intolerance in France. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is an unhealthy racist climate in France," Wiesel said. "It is 
not new but it is in the process of heating up. It is becoming more and more 
dangerous. French society must now examine its conscience -- and urgently." 
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, a member of the ruling Socialist Party, 
blamed right-wing politician Jean-Marie Le Pen for creating an atmosphere of 
racism and intolerance that leads to such acts of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
Joxe said Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front party that 
has been climbing recently in public opinion polls, is a "racist and a 
provocateur." 
</P>
<P>
"Like all racists," Joxe said, "like all those who express their anti-Semitism 
in an explicit or implicit fashion, he is obviously one of those responsible, 
not just for the acts at Carpentras, but of all that has been inspired by 
racial hatred for years." 
</P>
<P>
Although condemning the attack on the graveyard as "vile," Le Pen denied that 
he or his party bore any responsibility for it. Instead, he accused left-wing 
provocateurs of desecrating the cemetery to give the National Front a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems more and more that this was a political act against the National 
Front," Le Pen told a reporter for the Associated Press near Copenhagen, where 
he was attending a meeting of European right-wing politicians. "I don't feel 
guilty at all in this case. I condemn those who did this and I condemn those 
who organized this." 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, Le Pen has several times been accused of making 
anti-Semitic statements, including one speech in which he referred to Nazi 
extermination camps as a minor "detail" of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
After he won 11% of the vote in the first round of the 1988 presidential 
elections, Le Pen's National Front declined in popularity, winning only one 
seat in the 277-member National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the National Front has been able to exploit widespread 
French fears about a growing immigrant population, mostly from North Africa, to 
build a popular base. A recent national public opinion poll indicated that 17% 
of the population supports the red-faced, overweight, former paratrooper. 
</P>
<P>
Israel voiced horror at the attack and its ambassador in Paris, Ovadia Soffer, 
who attended the ceremony at the cemetery Friday, said he believed that 
Carpentras was deliberately targeted because the French Jewish community there 
is one of the oldest in France. Jews settled in Carpentras about 1,000 years 
ago and, when the papacy moved to Avignon from Rome in the 14th Century, their 
community enjoyed the special protection of the popes. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Avi Pazner, spokesman for acting Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, 
told the British news agency Reuters: "We are horrified by this act of 
anti-Semitism, which is really a reminder of the blind hatred that we Jews 
still have to face -- not only around us here in Israel but in many places of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
At the graveyard ceremony, Rabbi Jacques Ouaknine said a prayer for victims of 
the Nazi Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"In attacking the mortal envelope of our soul they attack the image of man and 
of God," Ouaknine said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 Jewish demonstrators from the southern port of Marseilles stood 
outside the cemetery, some of them carrying placards with slogans saying, "We 
will not let history repeat itself." 
</P>
<P>
Also present was the widow of Felix Germon. Germon, who died at the age of 81, 
was buried at the Carpentras cemetery only two weeks ago. Ripped from the grave 
by the vandals and stripped of clothing, his corpse was then impaled on an 
umbrella handle and a Star of David implanted on its chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the people who impaled my husband are impaled themselves," the weeping 
widow told French television. "He never harmed anyone. He never did anything 
but be a Jew."

Lithuania said Friday that it is stepping up efforts to break a Kremlin oil 
blockade, preparing its port to receive foreign tankers and for the first time 
exploiting its own oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Leonas Asmantas said talks were under way with oil suppliers in 
Saudi Arabia, Denmark and North America, and that the republic's port at 
Klaipeda would be ready to take deliveries starting next week. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania is also starting to produce oil from a small field at Kretinga in the 
northwest of the republic and to study offshore reserves in an attempt to end 
its heavy dependence on imported Soviet supplies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the port will be open within the next few days," Asmantas said by 
telephone from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. "Talks are under way with these 
countries but no contract has yet been signed." 
</P>
<P>
However, much would depend on whether the republic receives foreign credits 
with which to pay for the oil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said this week that the republic 
would run out of crude oil by May 25 as a result of the Kremlin blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow imposed the blockade in a bid to force Lithuania to rescind its March 11 
declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
The blockade has forced the closure of Lithuania's sole refinery at Mazeikiai, 
which was formerly processing about 12 million tons of oil a year, Asmantas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline is rationed in Lithuania and is in chronic short supply in the 
neighboring republics of Estonia and Latvia, which also used to receive 
supplies from the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's oil consumption, which had been running at about 16,600 tons a day, 
has been halved as a result of economy measures introduced since the blockade, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Local industry has laid off at least 20,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the presidents of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia prepared for today's 
summit meeting in which they will seek to coordinate their policies toward 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for as close cooperation as possible to find a suitable solution 
for the Baltic states, beneficial to all of us. We do not want to create undue 
conflict," said Endel Lippmaa, Estonian minister without portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, will be the first 
between the three presidents since independence-seeking movements won power in 
elections in the three Baltic republics earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Estonia and Latvia fear that, unless they join in a common stand, they will be 
subjected to economic sanctions by Moscow like those imposed against Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin was reported Friday to have taken its first steps against Latvia 
and Estonia, stopping transfers of hard currency to those two republics as well 
as Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
In Latvia, food rationing plans were announced.

MARS MISSION POSES PROBLEMS BUT HAS POSSIBLY BIG REWARDS

<P>
President Bush's goal of sending a manned expedition to Mars within 30 years 
poses unprecedented scientific and technological challenges but it also may 
lead to new insights into human and planetary evolution -- and perhaps even to 
material returns. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the obstacles is the debilitating, and possibly fatal, effects of 
prolonged exposure to zero gravity. 
</P>
<P>
But a Mars mission also would require more durable and lighter-weight building 
materials, better ways to protect spacecraft from debris and astronauts from 
radiation and -- above all -- more powerful rockets, perhaps nuclear-fueled, 
capable of launching massive vehicles and their components to the distant 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it's a much larger challenge than going to the moon," said John E. 
Pike, associate director for space policy at the Federation of American 
Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, however, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is 
studded with minerals such as cobalt, nickel and platinum that, if mined, could 
be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. "Those materials are available to the 
first nation that gets there," said one scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Close-up studies of Mars' surface and atmosphere also may provide new 
understanding of the basic forces that govern the solar system's evolution and 
possible signs of whether life ever existed there. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, astronomy conducted from Mars would be able to explore the cosmos 
with hundreds of thousands of times greater clarity than previously possible -- 
the new orbiting Hubble Space Telescope notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, there are some political realities to be dealt with on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if the Democratic Congress -- at a time of whopping 
deficits and rising interest rates -- will go along with the mission's 
estimated price tag of $500 billion. President Bush did not mention the 
projected cost in either of his two major speeches on Mars, the most recent on 
Friday in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The technological challenges may be more formidable. 
</P>
<P>
One current NASA scenario calls for Mars-going spacecraft to be assembled at 
the orbiting $30-billion space station, which the space agency hopes to 
complete around the turn of the century. Such spaceships might then shuttle 
between Earth and Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing travel time looms as the central challenge to a human mission to Mars 
because of the deleterious effects of zero gravity on astronauts. NASA 
scientists believe nuclear-powered rockets might reduce the one-way trip from a 
year to several months. 
</P>
<P>
But whether such an advanced technology is feasible is "too speculative" for 
now, according to scientists at the George C. Marshall Institute, a science 
think tank in Washington. "No element of research in preparation for the 
missions is more important," they said in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
The withering effect of prolonged weightlessness on bones and muscles were 
strikingly demonstrated when two Soviet cosmonauts returned to Earth after more 
than a year in orbit: They had enormous difficulty walking -- despite having 
exercised strenuously each day they lived in space. 
</P>
<P>
Experiments in the U.S. Skylab suggest that loss of bone mass could amount to 
30% during a two-year round trip to Mars, leaving the legs and spine 
dangerously fragile. Other tests have shown that serious immune deficiency 
could develop, while calcium loss could cause kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
According to Marshall's scientists, NASA acknowledges the importance of the 
zero-gravity problem but the agency has yet to recognize the need to conduct 
research and development into artificial gravity as a possible solution. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, the hazards of prolonged zero-gravity would be 
exacerbated by the spacecraft's rapid deceleration upon arrival at Mars. The 
sudden braking could put severe stress on the crew's weakened cardiac systems 
and skeletal structures. 
</P>
<P>
The Marshall scientists called for creation of a presidential commission, made 
up of experts from academia, industry and government, to oversee the mission.

Turning away from a capital immersed in its latest budget battle, President 
Bush on Friday set his sights on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
He renewed his commitment to landing Americans on the planet -- and for the 
first time set a public deadline for the mission: July 20, 2019, the 50th 
anniversary of the first moon landing by U.S. astronauts in the Apollo space 
program. But he did not say how the multibillion-dollar centerpiece of his new 
"Age of Exploration" would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to open up the final frontier. There can be no turning back," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that before Apollo celebrates the 50th anniversary of its landing on 
the moon, the American flag should be planted on Mars," the President said in a 
commencement address at Texas A&amp;I University here. 
</P>
<P>
While the President's deadline for a landing on Mars does not amount to a firm 
commitment to spend the necessary billions of dollars that will be needed to 
achieve the goal -- that commitment can be accomplished only with the 
cooperation of Congress -- his fiscal 1991 budget has asked for a 24% increase 
in spending for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the largest 
increase in funding for any major government agency next year. Under the 
President's plan, NASA would receive $15.2 billion in the fiscal year beginning 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's renewed focus on Mars, and space exploration in general, reflects a 
commitment he made last July 20, on the 20th anniversary of man's arrival on 
the moon, to return America to the business of space exploration and to send a 
manned spaceship to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, however, he set no timetables or budgets for the Mars mission, 
directing Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, to 
work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
The President also has set a goal of placing an operating space station in 
permanent orbit around Earth by the end of the century as the first step toward 
a permanent manned presence in space. He called for establishing sometime 
afterward a manned laboratory on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The Mars mission would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next three 
decades -- one estimate has it costing $30 billion to $35 billion annually -- 
and would culminate in a dangerous space voyage of two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked aboard Air Force One as he was about to leave Washington for Texas 
whether the United States could indeed reach his Mars goal in 30 years, he 
replied: "You have to go fairly fast. It's a long way out there." 
</P>
<P>
As for where the money would come from, he replied, "Thirty years is a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The risks of the journey are awesome: The astronauts' spaceship could collide 
with a meteoroid that could cause rapid decompression -- and death; violent 
storms on the surface of the sun could blast them with deadly radiation, if 
their craft is unprotected, and the team could be forced to spend a year on 
Mars, waiting for the planet to be aligned properly with Earth to allow them to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
For his speech Friday, Bush chose a 65-year-old university in the southern tip 
of Texas, a state heavily involved with the aerospace industry. Texas A&amp;I 
has an enrollment of nearly 6,000 students, 57% of whom are Latino. It 
graduated 407 students Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the nation's renewed commitment to exploration of space -- and 
his related plan to use space vehicles to better chart conditions on Earth, 
including changes in climate -- would generate widespread benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Our space program will help rekindle public interest in science and 
mathematics and revitalize an area of our educational system that has become 
disturbingly weak," the President said. "It will revolutionize everything from 
computers to communications, from medicine to metals, regaining and retaining 
America's high-tech competitive edge. It will create new technologies, new 
industries and new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
While the mission to Mars is the most dramatic element in Bush's overall space 
policy, the program dubbed "Mission to Planet Earth" is geared to produce more 
immediate results. 
</P>
<P>
It is intended to use satellites with a new array of sensors to measure sea and 
land temperatures, deforestation, and other elements in the phenomenon known as 
global warming over a period of several years.

MT. GRAHAM, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looming 10,700 feet above the Arizona sands, this mountain is an ecological 
island, a place where an exotic array of plants and wildlife -- cut off from 
other mountain ranges by miles of bone-dry desert -- have evolved in isolation 
since the last Ice Age. 
</P>
<P>
Now the mountain's wooded summit is the subject of a ferocious tug-of-war 
between backers of a construction project and biologists who fear that the work 
will push an endangered red squirrel to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
This is no classic stop-the-bulldozers battle. The alleged plunderers are 
astronomers who want to use Mt. Graham as a perch from which to peer at the 
darkest corners of the universe. And they have as an ally Interior Secretary 
Manuel Lujan Jr., the man responsible for enforcing the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's told me the difference between a red squirrel, a black one or a brown 
one," Lujan told a National Park Foundation banquet in Colorado on Thursday. 
"Do we have to save every subspecies?" 
</P>
<P>
Led by the University of Arizona, a partnership involving such heavyweights as 
the Smithsonian Institution and the Vatican plans to build a $200-million 
observatory atop Mt. Graham. The international venture would include the 
world's most powerful and sophisticated land-based telescopes -- a new 
generation of instruments that boosters say will help launch the next era in 
astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain's height and location far from city lights make it a perfect place 
for stargazing. But astronomers want to plunk their seven scopes in a dense 
forest that harbors the last living Mt. Graham red squirrels, a subspecies of 
small, quiet rodents that may number as few as 100. 
</P>
<P>
The result is one of the nastiest environmental battles in Arizona's history, a 
fight that has involved Congress, pleas for intervention from the Pope, 
sabotage by self-described "scope-busters" -- even a death threat to a 
university professor. 
</P>
<P>
"Our opponents have declared jihad on us -- holy war -- and their goal is to 
delay this thing so long that it dies," said astronomer Roger Angel, director 
of the university laboratory that is creating mirrors for the project's 
telescopes. "It's like international terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
"Mt. Graham's fate is not just an Arizona issue," countered Phoenix lawyer 
Charles Babbitt, president of the Maricopa County Audubon Society. "The 
university has thrown science and biology overboard and used money, lobbying 
and politics to try to ram this project through. If they can do that on this 
mountaintop, it can happen anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the fight took a surprising new turn when two biologists who work for 
the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service said in court depositions 
that they were ordered by superiors to prepare reports concluding that 
telescopes and squirrels could coexist on Mt. Graham. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony has triggered an investigation by the General Accounting Office 
and prompted a federal judge in Tuscon to grant a temporary injunction barring 
further work on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Because Congress relied on the biologists' reports in granting the university 
special permission to build in squirrel habitat before environmental reviews 
were complete, the GAO's findings could force a reconsideration of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction was a crushing blow for university astronomers, who were hoping 
to break ground this spring. Plans for the observatory date to 1980, when the 
university began work on a breed of new mega-scopes, which use giant mirrors 
that enable astronomers to see in detail celestial objects that today's 
telescopes display as mere pinpricks of light. 
</P>
<P>
These instruments work in concert with the Hubble Space Telescope launched last 
month: The Hubble can detect objects so small they have never been spotted, but 
the huge mirrors on the ground-based scopes provide the illumination needed to 
carefully study the discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
Among the partners enlisted by the university were the Smithsonian, the Max 
Planck Institute of West Germany and the Vatican Observatory. Pope Leo XIII 
founded the observatory in 1891, in part to answer critics who recall the Holy 
See's persecution of Galileo for his insistence that Earth revolved around the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
Other allies include three small farming communities near the mountain -- 
Safford, Thatcher and Pima. The city councils have endorsed the observatory and 
spent $500,000 on welcoming gestures like the installation of low-sodium 
lighting, help with construction of a road to the summit and plans for an 
airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, argue that neither an economic boost for Graham County nor a 
prestigious astronomical observatory for Arizona are important enough reasons 
to jeopardize the mountain's red squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
Discovered in the 1890s, the animal is one of 25 subspecies of red squirrels 
and is smaller and less chatty than its fellow rodents. The Mt. Graham critter 
also has a distinctive chromosome and may, some biologists suspect, have been 
the source population for all the red squirrels in the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the Mt. Graham squirrel has declined, mostly through 
piecemeal losses of habitat to logging and construction of roads and summer 
cabins. The last three years have been particularly grim, because a lack of 
rainfall has cut the crop of cones upon which squirrels rely for food. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the squirrel was placed on the nation's list of endangered species. 
Although university officials fought the listing, they now concede the animal's 
situation is precarious. 
</P>
<P>
But they also maintain their seven-scope project poses no threat to the 
squirrel. Indeed, one pro-telescope biology professor argues that the 
university could in fact become the squirrel's saviour because of the 
tree-planting and other mitigating measures the school must take in order to 
build on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"I predict a positive effect," said Conrad Istock, chairman of the Ecology and 
Evolutionary Biology Department. "We've removed the threat of logging from the 
mountain and are going to be reforesting 80 acres that will, in the long-term, 
be beneficial to the squirrel. That's a lot of trees." 
</P>
<P>
Critics -- who include Earth First! activists, Apache Indians who view the 
mountain as sacred, and even hunting and sportfishing groups -- call such logic 
nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like telling a dying patient on a hospital gurney that you'll give him 
a pint of blood next week but first you're going to have to take a gallon," 
said biologist Tom Waddell, Mt. Graham wildlife manager for the Arizona Game 
and Fish Department. "Well, what we've got here is a patient who may not make 
it to next week." 
</P>
<P>
While only 26 acres of forest would be cleared to make room for the seven 
telescopes, Waddell said the university has picked the flat, dense spruce fir 
thickets historically most favored by the squirrel. And, in addition to the 26 
acres, Waddell said some surrounding habitat will be degraded because a hole in 
the forest canopy exposes the squirrels' food caches to sunlight. Light and 
warmth can dry up the seeds on which the rodents feed. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows the squirrel's extinction threshhold, but we do know that 
anything below 500 is bad news," biologist Warshall said. "When you have a 
situation like that, you don't start cutting down trees." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy escalated dramatically when the university did what critics 
bitterly describe as an "end run" around the nation's two primary environmental 
protection laws -- the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental 
Policy Act. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Congress attached an unusual rider to a conservation bill that allowed 
the university to proceed with construction of three telescopes without 
finalizing environmental reviews. Arizona's entire congressional delegation -- 
including environmental champion Rep. Morris K. Udall -- supported the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists viewed the legislative move as a dangerous precedent, and soon 
national environmental groups such as Defenders of Wildlife and the Audubon 
Society had joined the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"When the nation's two most sacred environmental laws get flushed down the 
tubes in the state of Arizona, that gets people's attention," said Bob 
Witzeman, a Phoenix conservationist and Audubon Society leader. "It galvanized 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund sued the U.S. Forest Service on 
behalf of 10 organizations, and since then, the battle has heated up. 
</P>
<P>
Earth First! activists have chained themselves to grading equipment in protest 
of the university's construction of a road to the observatory site. A dead 
squirrel was sent to the home of the observatory project's director, and 
Istock, the pro-scope biologist, was even mailed a death threat. 
</P>
<P>
Still, until last month, the university's optimism about the project was on the 
rise. Then U.S. District Judge Alfredo C. Marquez granted a 120-day injunction, 
ruling that the federal biologists' startling depositions raise "some question" 
about the credibility of their reports. 
</P>
<P>
In the depositions, biologists Sam Spiller and Lesley Ann Fitzpatrick say they 
were directed by supervisors to reverse an earlier opinion and conclude that 
telescopes would not jeopardize the squirrel's continued existence. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed much more information on the squirrel and its habitat before a 
decision to site the project should have been made," Fitzpatrick said in the 
deposition. Her orders, she said, were to prepare a report "allowing 
development in accordance with the project proposed." 
</P>
<P>
University officials have appealed the injunction to the 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, and a ruling is expected soon. Meanwhile, some members of the Arizona 
congressional delegation say they may reopen the issue if the GAO's report 
reveals any impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
While they await a verdict, the combatants continue their angry sparring. There 
is no talk of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much at stake here for scientific research . . . and all we want 
are eight acres (for the first three telescopes) out of the entire mountain," 
Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
Such statements, the university's detractors respond, reflect the astronomers' 
hubris. 
</P>
<P>
"They can put those telescopes anywhere," said Waddell of the Game and Fish 
Department. "But we can't move the squirrels. We can't move the forest. So 
we're not gonna' give up."

Attorneys for Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega met in March with Cuban 
President Fidel Castro, who provided documents that will help defend Noriega 
against drug smuggling charges, a defense attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kollin, a Miami attorney who represents Noriega, confirmed a Friday 
report in the Miami Herald that defense attorneys had met with Castro in 
Havana. 
</P>
<P>
"Fidel Castro met with some of Gen. Noriega's lawyers and discussed certain 
sensitive issues with us," Kollin said. "He further provided us with certain 
documentation. The nature of that documentation cannot be revealed . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A judge has ordered prosecutors and defense attorneys to treat as classified 
any documents obtained from foreign sources. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have claimed that Castro mediated a dispute between Noriega and 
leaders of the Medellin cocaine cartel over the destruction of a cocaine lab in 
Panama.

MANFRED ZENDAR; EX-OLYMPIAN, WATER STUNTS EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manfred Zendar, 83, an Olympic swimmer whose work on such films as "Twenty 
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" and "Jaws" earned him the nickname "Hollywood's 
Water Man." As a marine adviser and certified master diver, Zendar scouted 
locations, operated boats, designed costumes and laid out underwater sequences 
for more than 50 movies. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Switzerland, Zendar had lived near the Southern California shore since 
1935, most recently in the Santa Monica Canyon area near Will Rogers State 
Beach. He placed third in the breast stroke in the 1924 Olympics in Paris and 
competed but failed to win a medal in the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. He began 
in films as an assistant cameraman for producer David O. Selznick and later did 
stunts -- diving from cliffs and doubling for actors wrestling alligators. He 
designed the diving suits for Walt Disney's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the 
Sea," built a raft for the Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum film "River of No 
Return," and created the 22-foot lift bags that raised the jet off the ocean 
bottom in "Airport '77." In Santa Monica on Monday of heart failure.

SCHOOL TO OFFER STUDENTS CONDOMS WITHOUT NOTIFYING THEIR PARENTS;

DISEASE: MARIN COUNTY CAMPUS BECOMES FIRST IN THE STATE TO HAVE SUCH A PROGRAM. 
IDEA RESULTED AFTER A POPULAR TEACHER WITH AIDS DIED.

<P>
After months of campaigning by students, a Marin County high school will become 
the first school in the state next week to offer condoms to the youngsters 
without notifying their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, students at Tamalpais High School persuaded a panel of 
teachers, parents and school officials to provide the free condoms through the 
school nurse along with a mandatory course teaching them how to use them to 
prevent diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people have opened up their eyes and taken their heads out of the 
sand," said student body president Dave Harris, who led the effort to provide 
condoms. "I think the students are crying out for something like this." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was spurred when a popular teacher with AIDS died recently, 
leaving many students "in shock," Harris said. In January, history teacher 
Chuck Smith told the youngsters of his illness and warned some of them to use 
condoms if they were sexually active. Smith died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, the repercussion of teen sex was pregnancy. Today it could 
also be death or infertility," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the school nurse will provide free condoms to any interested 
students, but only after they participate in a 20-minute orientation session 
that includes instruction on condom use as well as information on abstinence, 
venereal disease and AIDS. The names of participants in the one-on-one sessions 
will be kept confidential, school officials said. The condoms will be provided 
by a private nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just handing out condoms," said Yvonne Thurmond, Tamalpais' school 
nurse. "We'll discuss all of the options and certainly tell them abstinence is 
the safest option." 
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed mainly at sexually active teen-agers who are uncomfortable 
discussing sex with their parents, Thurmond said, adding that students who have 
a good parental rapport probably will not need the service. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize how many dysfunctional families there are or kids who are 
not staying with their parents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Barbara Galyen, like most Tamalpais educators and parents, was at 
first "very opposed" to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I was converted by education," said Galyen, who attributed her conversion to a 
series of presentations organized by Harris for the school's Parent Teacher 
Student Assn. Health educators, representatives from the Marin AIDS Support 
Network, Planned Parenthood and the Marin County Health Department all appeared 
before the association. 
</P>
<P>
"It just blew everyone's socks off. It was just so well put together," Thurmond 
said. "I didn't think he would pull it off. I would never have tried to do this 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
The effort was aided by sobering public health records showing that minors 
account for 25% of the reported cases of sexually transmitted diseases in Marin 
County, including the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Young adults from 18 to 21 
accounted for another 25%. 
</P>
<P>
After months of persistent lobbying, Harris won the support of the 
parent-student association May 1. On Wednesday night, a group of educators, 
parents and students who oversee activities at the high school voted 14 to 1 to 
support the proposal. The new program does not require the approval of the 
school board, principal Galyen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tamalpais acknowledges that students are sexually active and we're trying to 
do something responsible about it," student leader Harris said. "We're no 
different from most other high schools. I just think that students here are 
more vocal." 
</P>
<P>
Harris has won over most school officials and parents, but the program has 
opposition in the Bay Area religious community. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, San Francisco Archbishop John R. Quinn said the new proposal 
"implies the acceptance of causal sex as normal." 
</P>
<P>
"It can send a very destructive message that adults do not care what happens as 
long as youth do not cost them time or money by contracting diseases that can 
be both embarrassing and costly," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris strongly disagreed. "People aren't going to walk in here and say 'I'm 
going to become sexually active because they're giving out condoms,' " he said. 
"That's absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Three high schools in Los Angeles -- San Fernando, Jordan and Los Angeles -- 
provide condoms and contraceptive devices such as birth control pills in school 
health clinics but prior parental consent is necessary.

STATE'S AIDS PROGRAMS LACK DIRECTION AND COMMITMENT, WATCHDOG PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Little Hoover Commission on Friday said bureaucratic obstacles and a "lack 
of firm leadership, commitment and sense of direction" in the state's AIDS 
control effort have diluted the impact of California's $128 million in AIDS 
outlays. 
</P>
<P>
"While the state has committed substantial resources to dealing with AIDS, 
there is no coordinated effort to maximize the effect of those dollars," the 
commission reported, adding that "steps toward coordination have been 
tentative, halting and, in general, unsuccessful." 
</P>
<P>
The Little Hoover Commission, more formally known as the Commission on 
California State Government Organization and Economy, is a state watchdog 
agency that conducts periodic studies on various issues. 
</P>
<P>
The study's key conclusion -- that the state suffered from a lack of leadership 
and coordination -- echoed that of the National Commission on AIDS last month 
in its interim report on the federal response to the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
As of March 31, there were 25,658 reported cases of AIDS in California, and 
16,534 people had died. As many as 300,000 people are infected with the 
underlying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). About 33% of the state's AIDS 
patients are on Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Hoover Commission recommended that the governor and the Legislature 
designate the state Office of AIDS as the lead agency on the epidemic, making 
it the source of funding for all state AIDS programs. Currently the office has 
no control over $34 million, or more than 26%, of 1989-90 AIDS funds. That 
money is distributed by various state agencies, leading to "turf battles," 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also urged the Department of Health Services to take action on 
the widely hailed Strategic Plan issued by the state-appointed California AIDS 
Leadership Committee and to streamline procedures for issuing grants. 
</P>
<P>
In one harrowing example of bureaucratic inefficiencies in the state 
grant-making procedures, the commission cited Monterey County, which spends 
between $200,000 and $250,000 to administer $575,000 in AIDS grants. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gore, Gov. George Deukmejian's press secretary, said he hadn't seen the 
report. He added, however, that "furnishing the funds is leadership in and of 
itself." Norman Hartman, a spokesman for the California Department of Health 
Services, declined comment, saying he hadn't seen the study. 
</P>
<P>
"The report is right on target," said Torie Osborn, executive director of the 
Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, the second-largest community-based 
provider of AIDS services in Los Angeles. "But I wonder whether it will be 
acted upon or ignored, like so many other urgent calls to action in this 
crisis."

Ignoring a threatened boycott by Syria, 18 of the Arab League's 22 members have 
agreed to attend an emergency summit May 28 in Baghdad, Iraq, to discuss the 
influx of Soviet Jews into Israel. Syria regards Iraq as enemy territory. At 
the meeting, Arab leaders hope to forge a common front concerning the possible 
settlement of Soviet Jews on Israeli-occupied land, which they believe would 
thwart hopes for a Palestinian state.

Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi has resumed efforts to destabilize parts of Africa 
by training and financing rebels in Liberia and renewing his intervention in 
Chad, a senior State Department official said. Libya had trained the core of 
the Liberian rebel force before it launched an invasion in December, the 
official said. The United States had previously accused Libya of financing the 
rebels, but this was the first time it has alleged that Tripoli trained them as

The federal on-scene coordinator of the Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup, Coast 
Guard Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini, changed Exxon's work plan to require that 
the oil company take additional steps to protect the environment during the 
second year of cleaning up oil spilled when its tanker ran aground in Prince 
William Sound last year. Ciancaglini ordered Exxon not to leave treated beaches 
in a disturbed condition. He told the company that once its crews have removed 
oil from a beach, they should return it to its earlier shoreline profile.

The Minneapolis City Council approved a measure aimed at blocking enforcement 
of the federal law allowing the death penalty for some drug-related murders. 
</P>
<P>
It would have the city's law officers bypass the U.S. attorney's office if the 
death penalty were at stake. Officers instead would turn cases over to state 
and local prosecutors, because Minnesota has no death penalty. Critics say the 
resolution lacks teeth because federal authorities could still step in and try 
a homicide case if they wanted to. U.S. Atty. for Minneapolis Jerome Arnold 
responded that he is willing to try such cases and push for the death penalty 
where appropriate.

For the last 14 years, Mayor Tom Bradley and the council had repeatedly turned 
down equipment and funding requests, forcing the task force to rely on money 
from the Police Department's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's vote, the council allocated $361,000 from the city's 1990-91 
reserve fund to provide the 12-officer division with equipment and upgrade the 
pay and rank of some of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal now goes to the mayor for approval.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUCKEY TRIAL HALTED FOR JUDGE'S VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After several days of crucial testimony by an 11-year-old girl in the second 
trial of McMartin Pre-School molestation defendant Raymond Buckey, the 
proceedings were halted Friday by the judge's vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The trial will resume May 21, after a vacation scheduled by Superior Court 
Judge Stanley Weisberg. 
</P>
<P>
During intense questioning, a former McMartin student -- who did not appear 
during the first trial -- testified that she remembered sitting in Buckey's lap 
at the Manhattan Beach school while he molested her. She also said she 
remembered him stabbing a turtle to keep her quiet and taking pictures of her 
while she was naked. 
</P>
<P>
The child's testimony is considered important in the retrial of Buckey, who 
faces eight molestation counts stemming from alleged sexual assaults on three 
former students at the once-prestigious nursery school. In his first trial, 
Buckey, 31, was acquitted on 40 molestation counts.

UCLA PLAN BLASTED AS DONOR 'EGO TRIP'; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STATE BOARD PRESIDENT SAYS MOST AT CAMPUS DO NOT WANT TO MOVE 
ELEMENTARY LAB SCHOOL TO SANTA MONICA. LAND WOULD BE USED FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL 
FINANCED BY $15-MILLION GIFT.

<P>
The president of the State Board of Education said Friday that UCLA's 
controversial plan to move its on-campus laboratory elementary school to Santa 
Monica results from an "ego trip" by Los Angeles attorney and businessman John 
E. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has given the university $15 million to build a new Graduate School of 
Management on the lab school site on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Joseph D. Carrabino, who is an emeritus professor at UCLA's 
management school, told the monthly meeting of the state board that most 
teachers, parents and alumni do not want the lab school to be moved but that 
Anderson insisted on a "choice location on Sunset Boulevard" for the graduate 
school that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
To make this possible, Carrabino said, UCLA officials decided to move the lab 
school to Ocean Park, at the southern end of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big ego thing, nothing more," Carrabino said. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Anderson were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The State Board of Education was discussing the matter because some state 
policy issues might be involved if the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary 
School is transferred from the UCLA campus to a public school district. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Executive Vice Chancellor Murray L. Schwartz said, "It's not true that we 
are moving UES (University Elementary School) in order to make room for the 
Graduate School of Management." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Schwartz said, "This is not a done deal, but we are 
contemplating it" because UCLA education researchers could do more to solve 
American public education problems in a regular school setting than in the 
secluded campus lab school. 
</P>
<P>
If UCLA and the Santa Monica-Malibu district reach an agreement, the UCLA 
Graduate School of Education faculty will continue to run the school but it 
will be financed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal falls through, "we can continue UES on the present site," Schwartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that eventually the crowded, 450-acre UCLA campus will not 
be able to afford the luxury of operating an elementary school for only 450 
youngsters on a nine-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Dean J. Clayburn La Force of the Graduate School of Management said "there's 
not a shred of truth to the claim that we're eliminating the elementary 
school." He said "only a part of the southern edge of the (UES) campus" would 
be needed for the new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
La Force also denied that Anderson had insisted on a "choice location" on 
Sunset Boulevard for the school. 
</P>
<P>
When Anderson gave the $15 million in 1987, it was the largest single gift from 
an individual to any University of California campus. 
</P>
<P>
La Force said he "could not imagine" why Carrabino made his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said UCLA Chancellor Charles E. 
Young called him to ask if there were legal barriers or other problems involved 
in shifting the lab school to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Honig directed staff members to look into it because, "if the university, 
regardless of the right or wrong of it, makes a request, then we have an 
obligation to help clear the way." 
</P>
<P>
But Honig and state board members soon ran into a hornet's nest of criticism, 
in letters and phone calls, from opponents of the lab school move.

COUNCIL OKS $3.6-BILLION CITY BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wrapping up debate on a budget restrained by lack of funds, the Los Angeles 
City Council on Friday sent Mayor Tom Bradley a $3.6-billion 1990-91 spending 
plan that suspends a buildup of the Police Department, trims a wide range of 
services and raises fees and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made some painful decisions," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said as the 
budget deliberations closed Friday evening. "But we have done what needs to be 
done to avoid a much more severe problem next year." 
</P>
<P>
City and private analysts had warned that because of sluggish revenues, past 
overspending and borrowing to pay for equipment, the city was headed for a 
$100-million deficit next year. Yaroslavsky said the budget sent to Bradley 
remains "precarious," but significantly reduces the chances of a major crisis 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
But the council did not significantly alter the total spending amount proposed 
by the mayor, though it did make some funding shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The budget crunch dampened the spirit of Friday's debate, a process usually 
marked by heated struggles by various council members to win money for pet 
projects. As one indication of the reduced activity, the number of special 
funding motions by council members was down by more than 50% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor would have no immediate comment 
on the budget, but several City Hall observers said it seemed unlikely there 
would be the kind of veto fight that has marked other budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The council earlier had approved the most controversial element of Bradley's 
budget: a package of tax increases that includes a first-ever 10% surcharge on 
most city parking. 
</P>
<P>
Key among the council actions Friday was a budget juggling maneuver that 
restored $3.8 million to the Police Department to help offset cuts in overtime 
accounts. But the council did not come up with additional money to pay for 400 
new officers that both Bradley and the council initially endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
Council members on Friday also scrounged around for additional income by 
proposing -- for later approval -- new fees, including a 50-cent monthly 
utility bill surcharge to raise $9.7 million for an expanded graffiti cleanup 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to sharply boost fees for residents of other cities who use 
Los Angeles' golf courses and tennis courts.

CITY WINS OK FOR USE OF SEWAGE SLUDGE AS FERTILIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has won permission from a state water board to begin 
trucking tons of sewage sludge to the Antelope Valley for use as farmland 
fertilizer, an environmentally controversial ruling that could open the door to 
more such uses in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-1 decision by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board was a 
major victory for the city, which is seeking a cheaper and closer-to-home 
alternative for some of the sludge it has been trucking to farm fields in 
Riverside County and Yuma, Ariz. The decision is final unless there is an 
appeal within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling marks the first time land application of wet sewage sludge has been 
permitted in the fast-growing Antelope Valley, and one of only a few times it 
has been permitted anywhere in Los Angeles County, although the practice is 
more common elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Foes of the project called the board's ruling precedent-setting and said it 
could encourage more such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kettle, a county sanitation official, said the decision might encourage the 
county to try the same approach with Lancaster and Palmdale sludge that is now 
piling up in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the permit, Bio Gro Systems Inc. -- a private company that has the 
contract to transport the city's sludge -- will truck an average of 80 to 100 
tons a day of the city's concentrated sewage to the Antelope Valley. It will be 
spread and tilled into the soil of a 640-acre ranch Bio Gro purchased about 10 
miles west of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
The daily Antelope Valley haul represents about 7% of the 1,350 tons of the 
mud-like waste produced by the city each day. Los Angeles dumped it all into 
Santa Monica Bay until the federal government halted the practice on 
environmental grounds in late 1987. Since then, the sludge has gone either to 
landfills or remote farms. 
</P>
<P>
The state board's decision came late Thursday night after a more than 
three-hour public hearing in Lancaster. The water board staff, Los Angeles 
officials and farmers insisted the practice is safe, but local environmental 
and water agency officials remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Los Angeles feels this is not only an environmentally sound 
program, but can be an environmentally beneficial program," said Sheila 
Molyneux, a city sanitation official. She said sludge will improve crop yields 
and reduce the need for scarce water, harmful pesticides and commercial 
fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the water board's action, the city and Bio Gro will be required to 
conduct extensive water and soil sampling, and crops grown with the sludge 
cannot be used for human consumption. A Bio Gro spokeswoman said the sludge 
spreading could begin within several months. 
</P>
<P>
Local activists argued that the sludge could contaminate ground water and pose 
a health hazard. They also accused Los Angeles of trying to export its 
problems. "If they produce it in L.A., it should be gotten rid of in L.A.," 
said Marty Koppel, director of a local water agency. 
</P>
<P>
Local environmentalists also said the board's decision will pave the way for 
the Antelope Valley to become a sludge dumping ground for Los Angeles. City and 
Bio Gro officials acknowledged they are interested in expanding the program, 
but have yet to seek permission to use additional sites. 
</P>
<P>
Bio Gro originally proposed a much larger program involving five Antelope 
Valley sites totaling 3,500 acres and as much as 400 to 500 tons a day of 
sludge. But after that plan was disclosed in March, the four private farm 
owners dropped out, leaving only Bio Gro. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley became even more important to Los Angeles as an outlet 
recently when health officials in Riverside County imposed a temporary halt to 
sludge spreading in Blythe, where Bio Gro had been trucking much of Los 
Angeles' output after some Blythe area residents voiced water contamination 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County has had only two similar projects, officials said. The 
county sanitation districts until recently spread sludge on fields at the jail 
farm on the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Ranch near Saugus, and the Las Virgenes 
Municipal Water District has an ongoing project in Calabasas.

STUDY OF PLAN TO BREAK UP L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT OKD; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: STATE BOARD APPROVES $250,000 FOR FACT-FINDING. AN ADVOCATE OF THE 
PROPOSAL CALLS IT 'A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The State Board of Education on Friday approved spending $250,000 to study the 
feasibility of breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation that authorizes the expenditure does not refer to the Los 
Angeles district by name, but only to the reorganizing of "very small and very 
large" districts. But the 708-square-mile, 610,000-student district -- the 
second-largest in the nation -- is thought to be the only one in the state that 
would qualify as "very large." 
</P>
<P>
Any actual plan to dismantle the district would require voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), author of the measure, has 
for years been an outspoken critic of the Los Angeles school district. 
</P>
<P>
As a concession to colleagues, La Follette, who in past years has sought 
unsuccessfully to break up the district via the Legislature, requested this 
week that the state board drop any mention of Los Angeles from the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The change was made in response to members of two legislative subcommittees who 
this week expressed reservations about appropriating money for a single school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a step in the right direction," La Follette said of the state board's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a task force created by La Follette recommended that the Los 
Angeles district be divided into at least eight, and perhaps as many as 49, 
school districts. La Follette said she believes dividing Los Angeles into 
smaller districts would improve poor academic performance and solve other ills, 
such as campus crime. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette said the $250,000 approved by the state board is needed to pay for 
consultants who will draw up new district boundaries and seek answers to such 
thorny issues as how to divide up the students, property and debts of the Los 
Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
Once such a plan is created, the Los Angeles County Committee on School 
District Organization and the State Board of Education can call for a 
districtwide vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school district officials and teachers union leaders oppose La 
Follette's efforts, saying that reducing the size of the district will do 
little to improve student performance or reduce the number of dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the school district also say that efforts to divide up the 
district would likely be challenged on grounds that such plans would create 
more segregated school districts.

RED SOX LET OFF BY ANGELS IN NINTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seemed like secondary news, what with the questions surrounding the Dave 
Winfield trade, but the Angels and the Boston Red Sox actually played a 
noteworthy game Friday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 33,418 watched starters Jim Abbott and Mike Boddicker slog through 
the opposition's batting order. Neither foundered, but neither was particularly 
impressive. Perseverance seemed to be the word of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Boddicker, with relief help from Jeff Reardon and two leaping 
catches at the fence that robbed the Angels of three runs, fared better as 
Boston beat the Angels, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker (4-3) went eight innings, giving up seven hits, striking out two and 
walking three. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Angels' third consecutive loss, their eighth in the last nine and 
17th in the past 23, staying in a last-place tie with the Kansas City Royals, 
12 games behind the first-place Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Angels figured to be this close to Kansas City, but in last place? 
Both teams were expected to challenge Oakland for the American League West 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a way to sum it up," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. 
"When you lose, there's no easy sum. There is a preponderance of things. It's a 
simple fact that a couple of balls didn't travel far enough." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Friday's loss had the look of many of the Angels' recent games. 
</P>
<P>
They continued to get the least out of their offense, failing on scoring 
opportunities at an alarming rate. They even wasted a rare show of power by 
struggling center fielder Devon White, who hit a home run in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
Even gritty pitching by Abbott wasn't enough to bail them out against 
Boddicker. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbott pitched extremely well," Rader said. "It's a shame he didn't have 
something to show for it." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott (1-2) also went eight innings, giving up nine hits and two runs. He gave 
up three walks and struck out four, throwing 125 pitches before yielding to 
Mark Eichhorn to begin the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel starter also made a brilliant defensive play, knocking down Wade 
Boggs' shot back at him in the sixth. Abbott, the only Angel regular not to 
commit an error this season, pounced on the ball after it trickled behind the 
mound and threw out Boggs by a step. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Reardon, who got his second save, put the clamps on the 
Angels whereas Eichhorn (0-3) couldn't stop the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette couldn't catch up with Mike Greenwell's sinking line drive down 
the right-field line, which scored Boggs from second base for the go-ahead run 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' best, and only chance, against Reardon in the ninth was foiled by 
Ellis Burks, whose leaping catch of Jack Howell's drive to center field robbed 
the Angels of the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
"It was over by a glove length," Burks said. "Bruno (right fielder Tom 
Brunansky) said it was going over." 
</P>
<P>
Said Howell: "I don't think I can hit the ball any better. I really got all of 
it. Then I look up and see he's making the effort and I started to worry. Part 
of this game is getting breaks, having four or five home runs taken away in the 
last three, four games, I'd classify that as not catching too many breaks." 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Brunansky snuffed another scoring chance, leaping high at the 
right-center field fence to take a two-run home run away from Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to hit them farther," Angel designated hitter Brian Downing 
said. "An out's an out. Great defense is part of major league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Boston took a 2-1 lead in the sixth on light-hitting Luis Rivera's run-scoring 
single to left that scored Burks. Rivera was hitting .100 as he stood in to 
face Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
But the Angels came back to tie, 2-2, in the bottom of the inning. Lance 
Parrish's two-out single to left scored Wally Joyner from second. It wasn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill will miss his next start because of tightness in his right 
elbow, but he said it's not the same problems that plagued him in 1987 and 88. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just some tightness and we just want to give it a chance to calm down," 
said McCaskill, who said he has none of the pain that accompanied the bone spur 
that necessitated surgery in 1987. "It's just a lot of inflammation." He will 
start again on May 19 against Toronto, according to Manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Johnny Ray missed his fourth consecutive game with bursitis in 
his right shoulder. Tests taken earlier this week showed no bone damage. Donnie 
Hill started in Ray's place for the second game in a row. . . . Third base 
coach Moose Stubing missed the game to attend his daughter's graduation from 
Texas A&amp;M. First base coach Bobby Knoop filled in at third with Deron 
Johnson at first.

MESSAGE IS LOST ON DODGERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: PEP TALK BY LASORDA FAILS TO INSPIRE VICTORY AS CLUB LOSES FIFTH IN A 
ROW, 9-4. GOODEN STRIKES OUT 15.

<P>
You know those heartwarming baseball stories in which the manager of a slumping 
team delivers an inspirational pregame speech, then his team beats the 
bejabbers out of an opponent? 
</P>
<P>
This isn't one of those stories. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda provided the inspiration Friday, but the Dodgers didn't respond. 
Dwight Gooden pitched one of the worst 15-strikeout games in recent memory, and 
the Dodgers lost their fifth consecutive game, 9-4, to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, who prefers individual pep talks to team meetings, broke tradition 
before this first game of a weekend series. The short session behind closed 
clubhouse doors was as necessary as it was unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told we have to stop getting beat by mental errors," Mickey Hatcher 
said. "We were told to keep going all out, going hard, and not to lose by not 
doing the little things." 
</P>
<P>
So what do they do? In addition to a three-run triple by Gooden against Mike 
Morgan, the Dodgers were hammered by the little things: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A ground ball that skipped off Lenny Harris' glove at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A low throw to first base by Willie Randolph on an attempted double play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alfredo Griffin challenging one of the best left fielders in the league, 
Kevin McReynolds, on a play at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three Dodgers reaching third base with fewer than two outs, only to be 
stranded. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers took a 3-2 lead in the third inning, but those little things added 
up to a five-run Met half of the third. 
</P>
<P>
"It really looked like we got off in the right direction," Lasorda said. "Then 
the roof caved in." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Dodgers are eight games behind the first-place Cincinnati Reds 
in the National League West. Last season, the Dodgers weren't as many as eight 
games out of first place until June 23. Last year, they never lost more than 
five games in a row and only did that twice. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, you have to sit back and wonder what is happening," said 
Hatcher, who drove in the Dodgers' final run with an eighth-inning pinch 
single. 
</P>
<P>
That hit also should have set up a final Dodger rally, as it came with one out 
and runners on first and third. Except that Griffin tried to take third on 
McReynolds, who in 1988 led all National League outfielders with 18 assists. He 
easily threw out Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to make something, but I guess I did it at the wrong time," said 
Griffin, who had reached base with a single -- his first hit in 12 at-bats. "It 
had been so long since I was on base, I got all excited." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the crowd of 34,817 were excited about Gooden, who showed his best 
strikeout form in five years and the best hitting form of his career. 
</P>
<P>
He finished with the most strikeouts in a game in the league this season, and 
his most strikeouts since his career high of 16 on Aug. 20, 1985. But he also 
gave up nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy could have gotten beat," Lasorda said. "You look at the game and you 
see that his performance was very unbalanced, very misleading. He could have 
easily lost." 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the first inning Randolph singled and stole second with one 
out. But Kal Daniels and Eddie Murray struck out. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, Scioscia doubled with one out and took third on Harris' 
infield single. Griffin and Morgan then struck out. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Samuel hit a one-out double and stole third against catcher 
Mackey Sasser, who allowed four steals. But Samuel was stranded as Randolph and 
Daniels struck out. 
</P>
<P>
"The point of the game is that," Lasorda said. "Not getting those runners 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who fell to 4-2 while Gooden improved to 2-3, gave up four hits in 
three innings, but the Mets scored seven runs on four walks, a hit batter and 
Dodger blunders. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets scored their second run in the second inning when Randolph couldn't 
complete a double play on Gooden's grounder. Gooden's four runs batted in tied 
a club record for pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' five runs in the third inning came after Harris couldn't handle a 
possible double-play grounder by McReynolds with one out and runners on first 
and second. Four batters later, Gooden hit his triple. 
</P>
<P>
"A different play here or there, and it could have been a different story," 
Morgan said. "It is a game of inches, and tonight we didn't have the inches." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson took 40 swings in a batting cage Friday, setting the stage for his 
first live batting practice next week. He also sprinted through the outfield 
and on the basepaths. "Our plan was to have him take live hitting when he could 
run full speed, and he looks close to that now," therapist Pat Screnar said. 
Gibson could be back in the lineup for the start of the Dodgers' first series 
with the division-leading Cincinnati Reds at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell threw a 28-pitch simulated game Friday, and, while he has yet to put 
stress on his surgically repaired left knee, he said the knee continued to feel 
good. He will throw another simulated game in Los Angeles Monday, the day he is 
eligible to return from the disabled list. If he feels well, he could be back 
on the roster by the middle of next week. "I've worked very hard, but it's also 
amazing," Howell said of his rapid recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gott retired three consecutive class-A batters in his fourth rehabilitation 
assignment for Bakersfield against Palm Springs Thursday. In seven innings at 
class A, Gott has given up two runs on six hits with two walks and six 
strikeouts. While the Dodgers acknowledge that he still does not have full arm 
strength, Gott's two rehabilitation innings in Bakersfield against Reno today 
and Sunday could be his final efforts there and a decision on his status could 
be made Monday. Also pitching for Bakersfield Sunday will be rehabilitating 
Dodger Pat Perry.

Tampa police officers who mistakenly stopped Milwaukee Brewer infielder Gary 
Sheffield and a friend outside a bar two months ago were part of a nine-member 
squad that was disbanded last week because of citizen complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen complaints have been filed against members of the squad since 1980, 14 
in the last three years, the St. Petersburg Times reported. Four complaints 
were sustained, five were ruled false, and seven were unsubstantiated. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield, 21, and Chuck Jones, 23, filed a harassment complaint March 16, two 
days after they allege that officers stopped the baseball player's car, 
searched the men at gunpoint and cursed them before allowing Sheffield and 
Jones to leave.

Three former sports agents were sentenced to prison for six months each by a 
federal judge in Tallahassee, Fla., on charges that they funneled illegal 
payments to University of Florida athletes in attempts to represent them in 
professional contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
After pleading that they only tried to help the athletes, Gerald Gratenstein, 
John A. Kasbar and Glenn Haft were sentenced to minimum security facilities. A 
fourth agent, Gregory Latimer, received five years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
The men ran the Professional Athletes Financial Advisors, Inc., in Hollywood, 
Fla., until they were accused last year of paying several Florida athletes to 
sign with the agency.

DIABETES GROUP HONORS RANDOLPH

As awards go, Willie Randolph has won rooms full of bigger, brighter, more 
recognizable trophies. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps there is no honor that has touched the Dodger second baseman as 
deeply as the one he will receive in Los Angeles Monday afternoon, when he will 
be one of the original inductees into the NutraSweet/Juvenile Diabetes 
Foundation Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem as if it's just another obscure accolade with a long title, unless 
you have a 10-year-old daughter with a lovely name, Chantre, and a painful 
illness, juvenile diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny they should do something like that right now," Randolph said this 
week in Montreal, when his selection -- which came as a surprise to him -- was 
announced. "I just talked to Chantre on the phone back in New Jersey. She's 
been having a real hard time, going through normal growth changes with her 
blood sugar also changing. She was feeling real bad. 
</P>
<P>
"But she was crying because she needed to go to school and run in this relay 
race. So, we didn't stop her. And everything turned out fine. But it's a 
battle, a constant battle. We just hope they can come up with something to help 
her in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph has donated time and money toward his daughter's cause since her 
condition was diagnosed as diabetes several years ago. But perhaps his most 
notable effort has been his smallest -- he wears a tiny red JDF pin on a 
stirrup of his blue baseball sock that has attracted attention nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime they get a closeup of it on TV, I get letters," Randolph said. "I 
don't think it's any big deal to wear it, but every little thing helps." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's trip into Shea Stadium, where the Dodgers are playing the New 
York Mets, marks the first anniversary of Randolph's pin. He received it in a 
most unusual fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing on the field, and some kid threw it at me," he recalled. "I 
thought it was just another unruly fan trying to hit me with something, until I 
reached down and picked it up. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw what it was, I said, 'Oh yeah,' and waved at the kid who threw it 
at me. Worn it ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph is counting on that pin becoming obsolete. He hopes doctors will 
discover an implant that will allow diabetics to avoid daily injections. 
</P>
<P>
"What my daughter goes through right now is so hard," he said. "She has to 
prick her finger four or five times a day to test her blood sugar to see how 
much insulin she has to take. And then she has to take her injections." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph added: "What I do is the smallest, easiest part. My daughter is the 
tough one."

HORSE RACING / PIMLICO SPECIAL;

<P>
Neil Drysdale does not seem the kind of trainer who would run a filly against 
colts, even if the race is worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale, who can't remember ever starting a filly against colts in an 
important race, will saddle Gorgeous here today for the Pimlico Special, which 
has received a $300,000 purse boost to become Maryland's first seven-figure 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale is uncomfortable discussing how Gorgeous got to the Pimlico Special, 
which would seem to indicate that the decision to run here was made by Robert 
Clay, owner of the 4-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
Her opposition will consist of six colts and three geldings. Four of them, like 
Gorgeous, have earned more than $1 million in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
The chief opponents are Ruhlmann, who has won a $1-million race this year, the 
Santa Anita Handicap; Opening Verse, from the same barn that won last year's 
Special with Blushing John; and With Approval, last year's Canadian Triple 
Crown champion, who has been training sensationally since arriving in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the field for the 1 3/16-mile race -- the same distance as the 
Preakness that will be run here a week from today -- will be Criminal Type, 
Music Merci, Mi Selecto, De Roche, Silver Survivor and Wind Splitter. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Drysdale is a reluctant trainer or not, Gorgeous seems to be at her 
peak as she tries to become the second filly to win the Special. In 1944, 
Twilight Tear, a 3-year-old, trounced her only two opponents -- Devil Diver and 
Megogo -- and later became the first filly to be voted horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, who has won seven of 11 starts with three seconds and a third, won 
the Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park three weeks ago, equaling the track 
record for 1 1/16 miles and beating Bayakoa, the mare who had accounted for two 
of Gorgeous' four defeats. One of Bayakoa's victories over Gorgeous was in the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff last fall at Gulfstream Park, a victory that determined 
the divisional championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked extensively with Mr. Clay about running Gorgeous here," Drysdale 
said Friday. "There are quite a few advantages to do it, and there's not much 
to speak of on the downside. 
</P>
<P>
"Our options had been to run in the Milady and the Vanity (two handicaps at 
Hollywood Park). Despite running here, we can still run her in the Vanity, 
which was part of the original schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa stepped out of her division and ran poorly in the Santa Anita Handicap. 
"I guess we've got the leeway to do the same thing," Drysdale said. "But even 
if this race doesn't work out, we can still regroup for our fall objectives." 
</P>
<P>
The weights, in Drysdale's judgment, are not favorable. Ruhlmann will carry the 
most, 124 pounds, with Opening Verse at 120, With Approval at 118 and Gorgeous 
and Criminal Type at 117 apiece. Because fillies receive a five-pound allowance 
from males, Gorgeous theoretically was rated at 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think we'd be second-highest with this group," Drysdale said. "After 
Ruhlmann, there are some very nice horses in here: With Approval, Opening 
Verse, Mi Selecto. This is a very substantial field." 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale has trained some outstanding fillies and mares, including Princess 
Rooney and Bold 'n Determined, and he talked Friday as though there had been 
one day that Princess Rooney might have beaten the colts. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first Breeders' Cup (at Hollywood Park in 1984), Princess Rooney won 
the Distaff by seven lengths," Drysdale said. "She ran a mile and a quarter in 
a faster time than they ran the Classic a little later, and I was told that the 
track was playing slower for the Distaff than it was for the Classic (which was 
won by Wild Again over Gate Dancer and Gorgeous' sire, Slew o' Gold). Going by 
that, I guess Princess Rooney would have won the Classic." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, who will be ridden by Gary Stevens, is expected to run out front 
today, and Eddie Delahoussaye, aboard Gorgeous, will have to determine how 
close they need to be to have a shot at trainer Charlie Whittingham's horse in 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of other front-runners to put pressure on Ruhlmann bothers Wayne 
Lukas, who trains Criminal Type. "Charlie holds all the cards in this race," 
Lukas said. "It's no secret that Ruhlmann will dictate the race." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said: "I hope it turns out the way Wayne thinks. I've got a good 
and quick horse out of the gate, and I don't think the track will bother him 
any." 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Miller isn't so sure. Miller, one of Maryland's leading riders and the 
winner of the Preakness with Deputed Testamony in 1983, has an opinion, if not 
a mount, for the Special. "Sometimes those California horses come here and 
can't handle this deep going," Miller said. "I think the winner might be a 
horse that comes from someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, two horses who had been running in Arkansas, Blushing John and 
Proper Reality, ran 1-2. Horses with California backgrounds -- Saratoga 
Passage, Stalwars and Lively One -- ran no better than sixth. Opening Verse's 
last start was an easy victory in the Oaklawn Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
The rain that fell earlier in the week has stopped and the track is expected to 
be fast. That suits Drysdale. Gorgeous is one of the few horses with a Daily 
Racing Form "mud mark" who, in reality, dislikes the slop.

VETERAN REPORTER, REFEREE DESCRIBE MANILA FIGHT AS THRILLA OF LIFETIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
NBC-TV will replay a classic today, showing Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier III, "the 
Thrilla in Manila," in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Schuyler, the Associated Press' boxing reporter since 1969, has covered 205 
championship bouts. He was asked where he ranks the Thrilla in Manila, which 
Ali won. Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, asked that the fight be stopped after 
the 14th round. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best I ever saw, no question," he said. "It was like watching two 
middleweights who had nothing to lose. Frazier hit Ali so hard with a left hook 
in one of the middle rounds, Ali's head looked like it was on a swivel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I never saw a fight where two guys took as much punishment as those 
two did that day. After that fight, as fighters, neither one was ever worth a 
damn." 
</P>
<P>
The fight, which will be re-run on Channel 4 at 2 p.m. today, was the final 
matchup of Ali and Frazier, two markedly different human beings and fighters, 
placed in the same era. They belonged to each other, as did Schmeling and 
Louis, Zale and Graziano and Robinson and Basilio. 
</P>
<P>
Their three fights were all memorable. But the finale, held at 11 a.m. on Oct. 
1, 1975, outdoors in a Manila stadium, will be treasured by boxing buffs for 
generations. In their first meeting, in 1971, Frazier took Ali's championship 
in a 15-round decision at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't meet again until 1974, when neither was champion. Frazier had lost 
his crown to 25-year-old George Foreman the previous year. Ali beat Frazier on 
a 12-round decision in New York, setting up a rubber match. 
</P>
<P>
A big year for Ali, 1974. After beating Frazier, he went to Zaire eight months 
later and, in an upset, knocked out Foreman to regain his title. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Padilla was a 41-year-old referee in those days. He was considered a 
competent referee, one of the best in the Philippines, but he'd never worked a 
world title fight before. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Philippines, all the certified referees put on their referee uniforms 
and went to the fight together," he said the other day. "You are never told you 
are going to work until one hour before the bout. And that's how it was -- the 
head of the boxing commission tapped me on the shoulder an hour before 
Ali-Frazier and said, 'It's you, Carlos.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, Padilla is still on the world's boxing stage. He has 
refereed 74 world title fights. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd worked Philippines and Asian championship fights, but never a world title 
fight," he said. "It's also interesting to a lot of people that before that 
day, I'd never worked a weight class higher than lightweight. In fact, most of 
the fights I did in the Philippines were flyweight bouts." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla found Ali hard to handle, but Frazier was cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
"Ali had a way of using his forearm on the backs of his opponents' necks, and 
holding them down," he said. "The boxing commissioner told me that before the 
fight and told me to warn him if he did it. He did it, and I warned him. They 
told me afterward, Ali had never been warned for it before. 
</P>
<P>
"Frazier fought cleanly all the way. He never held or hit on the break or 
anything like that. I don't remember cautioning him for anything." 
</P>

Two years after the Thrilla in Manila, Padilla moved to Las Vegas, where his 
mother had lived for years. He became a U.S. citizen in 1984 and is considered 
one of Nevada's top referees. He has also been a bartender and a blackjack 
dealer in Las Vegas. He's an actor in the Philippines and sometimes goes back 
to the old country when a film role is offered. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, the Thrilla in Manila lives brightly in his memory and not 
only because it was his first championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I would have to say it was maybe the most exciting, the most intense 
fight I ever worked," he said.

Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former professional middleweight Johnny Smith will promote his first boxing 
card May 23 at the Airport Hyatt Hotel. It will match middleweights Larry 
Musgrove and Roberto Rosiles in a 10-round main event. . . . Huntington Beach 
lifeguard John Armijo will make his main-event debut at the Irvine Marriott on 
May 24 against 1980 U.S. Olympian Alex Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
Navy bantamweight Sean Fletcher of San Diego was named to a six-boxer U.S. 
amateur team that will fight at the Papeete Celebration tournament in Tahiti 
May 22-28. . . . Evander Holyfield will have a tuneup while he waits for the 
Buster Douglas-Don King-Steve Wynn legal problems to be resolved. He'll fight 
New York journeyman heavyweight Seamus McDonagh on June 1 on Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, NBC-TV will showcase one of boxing's hot prospects, super-bantamweight 
Jamal Hinton, who is 13-0 with 11 knockouts. Hinton was the sensation of the 
amateurs in 1988 until a shoulder injury knocked him out of the Olympic trials. 
He will fight Alberto Martinez. In the second half of the super-bantamweight 
doubleheader, starting at 10:30 a.m. on Channel 4, Jesse Benavides will meet 
Kelvin Seabrooks. On its June 10 boxing program, NBC will show the Paul 
Gonzales-Orlando Canizales International Boxing Federation bantamweight 
championship match from El Paso. And on that undercard, 1988 Olympian Todd 
Foster will make his network debut. 
</P>
<P>
The smallest man on the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, Michael Carbajal, who won a 
silver medal as a light-flyweight, will become the first from that team to 
fight for a world title when he faces Thailand's IBF junior-flyweight champion, 
Muangshai Kittikasem, on Sept. 2, also on NBC. . . . Now that Jerry Quarry has 
been granted a boxing license in Wisconsin -- he has a fight in Lake Geneva 
June 2, according to Guy Ditmars, his trainer -- and is training for another 
comeback, wouldn't this be a perfect time for Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali to 
come back, too? Since Wisconsin apparently will license anyone, why stop with 
Quarry? Whatever became of Leon Spinks?

Boxing -- In the Saturday boxing column, it was reported that the "Thrilla In 
Manila," the third Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight, was held in an outdoor

heavyweight champion when they met for the first time in 1971. Frazier was the

DFG DROPS 100 BECAUSE OF SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game, beset by dwindling hunting and 
fishing license sales that have led to a budget shortfall of between $7.5 
million and $10 million, has dropped about 100 temporary workers from its 
payroll and placed restrictions on overtime payments and travel. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts, expected to save hundreds of thousands of dollars, should not affect 
enforcement and wildlife protection or the hatchery system and fish-stocking 
programs, according to DFG deputy director Paul Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is redirect permanent help," he said this week. "We're 
trying to make sure that the hatcheries are operated at a level that's 
acceptable, and that our license function and wildlife protection is not 
impacted. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to maintain our up-front operations. For example, (Thursday) we 
were talking about taking people from the headquarters function and putting 
them over in the license section for the remainder of the year because we're 
just now getting into hunting license and deer tag sales and what have you, so 
this is really heavy work time over there." 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said no further cuts have been announced or are expected, and that the 
department is putting together a package of "concrete proposals" for the 
Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee to generate revenue. That might include 
requests for more money from the state's sale of personalized license plates. 
About $16 million went into the DFG budget from this source last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility, Jensen said, would be to dip into the general fund to help 
hunting and sportfishing programs, which are supposed to be self-supporting.

WHOLESALE PRICES DROP 0.3%, EASING FEARS THAT INFLATION IS HEATING UP; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: RETAIL SALES FELL 0.6% IN APRIL. THE TWO REPORTS SUGGEST THAT INTEREST 
RATES HAVE PEAKED.

<P>
Large declines in food and energy prices pushed wholesale prices down 0.3% in 
April, the Labor Department said Friday in a report that appeared to help ease 
concerns about a possible inflation-fueled rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.6% 
during April, following a 0.2% decline in March. The slower sales, together 
with last week's report of an increase in April unemployment, were seen as 
signs of a rapidly weakening economy. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's financial markets interpreted the reports as welcome omens that 
interest rates have peaked -- that the Federal Reserve will not be inclined to 
push them higher to combat inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Rates on long- and intermediate-term bonds plummeted, bond prices surged and 
the Dow Jones industrial index of blue chip stocks soared 63.06 points to close 
above 2,800 for the first time in months. 
</P>
<P>
Economists agreed that April's decline in wholesale prices, which fell 0.2% in 
March, reflected slowing inflation for finished goods and for many intermediate 
and crude commodities. 
</P>
<P>
But they warned that inflation remains entrenched in the service sector of the 
economy, which now contributes the lion's share of economic growth and is not 
reflected in the producer price index of wholesale price movements. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure helped the markets," noted economist Michael Penzer of Bank of America 
in San Francisco. "But the bond market these days is looking for economic 
weakness, and I don't think the economy is as weak as the bond market does." 
</P>
<P>
Penzer and Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. investment firm, said 
inflation in the services sector is a continuing concern. 
</P>
<P>
"The producer price index doesn't tell us about services -- and that's where 
the inflation is, and that may also be where most of the consumer buying is," 
Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the decline in finished goods prices was concentrated in food and 
energy. Food prices fell 0.6%, continuing a reversal from steep midwinter 
increases. Energy prices dropped 1.7% in a similar correction from a freak 
13.4% increase in January, when weather-related energy inflation sent producer 
prices soaring 1.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding food and energy, the "core" rate of April inflation for finished 
goods was 0.2%. Among the major contributors was a 0.9% decline in wholesale 
prices of passenger cars and a 0.5% decline for trucks, both reflecting weak 
sales in the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see recession in this report, but I do see a sluggish consumer, 
because consumer prices have been rising faster than wages and people aren't 
buying," said Donald Ratajczak, a specialist in price movements at Georgia 
State University in Atlanta. "There seems to be no question of the Fed 
tightening now." 
</P>
<P>
Prices for intermediate goods, which represent an earlier stage in the 
production chain, were up a scant 0.1% in April. The small increase, which 
reflects a winter decline in energy prices, suggests that inflation will 
continue to be moderate at the wholesale level in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of raw materials were pushed down a steep 3.1%, reflecting a 7.8% drop 
in energy products, primarily crude petroleum. But a midwinter drop in prices 
of scrap metal, copper and other crude industrial materials, which had raised 
recession fears a few months ago, was reversed in April. 
</P>
<P>
Those basic metals, noted Ratajczak, showed some "big-time" increases: aluminum 
scrap rose 7.3%, iron scrap 6.4% and copper scrap 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, the producer price index stood unchanged at 117, 
compared to a 1982 base of 100. That means a cross-section of finished goods 
that cost $100 eight years ago would have cost $117 last month.

AMAX: WANTS TO BUY PEABODY HOLDING, BIDS $1.25 BILLION

<P>
Amax Inc., the nation's third-largest coal producer, made a $1.25-billion offer 
Friday for industry leader Peabody Holding Co., raising the possibility of a 
bidding war with a major Peabody investor. 
</P>
<P>
The bid was rejected immediately by Hanson Industries, which owns 45% of 
Peabody and is attempting to buy the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson responded by raising its offer for the Peabody shares it doesn't own. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 55% of St. Louis-based Peabody is owned by Newmont Mining Corp. 
of Denver. Hanson, in turn, owns 49% of Newmont. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson in March offered to buy Newmont's stake in Peabody for $715 million. But 
under terms of the sale agreement between Hanson and Newmont, the companies 
agreed to consider outside bids for all of Peabody until the deal with Hanson 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Closing tentatively was scheduled for sometime next month, said Newmont 
spokesman James Hill. 
</P>
<P>
After New York-based Amax disclosed its bid Friday, Hanson immediately 
increased its offer for Newmont's Peabody stake to $725.6 million. That tops 
the $718.5 million that Newmont's stake is worth under the Amax offer, Hanson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said Newmont's agreement to sell its Peabody stake to Hanson remained in 
effect but that the Amax bid started an auction process for Peabody.

VSI, 2 EX-EMPLOYEES PLEAD GUILTY TO FALSIFYING REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VSI Corp. of Culver City pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in 
Seattle to four counts of falsifying and omitting test results for fasteners 
used in commercial and military aircraft, and will pay $18 million in damages, 
fines, civil penalties and costs of prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Two former VSI employees also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to 
defraud the government. James E. Ryan, former quality assurance manager at 
VSI's Voi-Shan plant in Chatsworth, and Aram Marderian, a former Voi-Shan 
metallurgical lab supervisor, face prison sentences of up to five years and 
$250,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The case was the biggest ever initiated under the federal whistle-blower 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan and Marderian also agreed to cooperate with federal authorities in an 
ongoing investigation of Voi-Shan "that involves other possible employees," 
U.S. Atty. Mike McKay said in a telephone interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
VSI, a subsidiary of Fairchild Industries Inc. of Chantilly, Va., is the 
largest supplier of the nuts and bolts that hold aircraft engines and other 
components in place. Its customers include the U.S. military, Boeing, McDonnell 
Douglas, Lockheed, General Electric, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
In pleading guilty, VSI admitted to one count of conspiracy and three counts of 
mail fraud. As part of the resolution of the criminal charges, it will pay the 
government $2.5 million in fines and $1 million in investigation costs. 
</P>
<P>
The $14.5-million civil settlement was a record amount for suits filed under 
the False Claims Act, which allows individuals to sue on behalf of the 
government and to share in any recovery of damages. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges, filed by federal prosecutors in Seattle Wednesday, grew 
out of a civil suit that three former Voi-Shan employees filed in 1988. McKay 
said the government's investigation uncovered a 15-year scheme to skip required 
tests and falsify test results. The falsified tests were recorded as having 
been approved by a fictitious "Inspector No. 11." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that any airline tragedy resulted from bad bolts or 
fasteners from Voi-Shan," said McKay. "But it sure could have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Parker, Fairchild's general counsel, said the problems at Voi-Shan, 
which accounts for as much as $50 million of VSI's $150 million in annual 
sales, have been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no further shortcuts," Parker said, adding that Voi-Shan would 
"cooperate fully" with the government's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
McKay said the whistle-blowers -- former Voi-Shan employees Tom Runion, Gary 
Heywood and Paul Hertog -- will receive at least $2.175 million of the $14.5 
million civil settlement. The exact amount will be determined by a federal 
judge in Los Angeles, where the civil suit was filed and kept under seal until 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Will Ramsey, an attorney representing Runion, Heywood and Hertog, said 
he will object to the settlement and seek a higher figure.

AZT MAKER LAUNCHES HIV TESTING DRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
PHARMACEUTICALS: ACTIVIST GROUPS HAVE CRITICIZED BURROUGHS WELLCOME. THEY SAY 
THE DRUG, WHICH IS KEY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST AIDS, IS PRICED TOO HIGH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Against a backdrop of skepticism, Burroughs Wellcome, maker of the antiviral 
drug AZT, is launching an initiative in the 25 U.S. cities with the highest 
rates of HIV infection to persuade people who might be infected with the 
AIDS-causing virus to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
The Research Triangle Park, N.C., pharmaceutical company told The Times Friday 
that it is instituting the program because hundreds of thousands of Americans 
who are infected but show no signs of the disease might benefit from AZT 
therapy if they knew that they were infected. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs, which has responded to sharp criticism of the high cost of AZT with 
two price cuts of 20% each, said it will conduct the "outreach program" through 
local AIDS service organizations and community-based groups. AZT costs about 
$3,000 a year at the dose that public health officials recommend. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the average incubation period from the time of 
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and the development of 
full-blown AIDS is about 12 years. Last summer, clinical researchers released a 
pair of studies demonstrating that early administration of AZT delayed the 
onset of AIDS. That prompted public health officials to urge people at risk to 
take the test. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 Americans are taking AZT for full-blown AIDS and early 
intervention against HIV. However, the U.S. Public Health Service has estimated 
that 10 times that number -- more than 400,000 of the 1 million believed 
infected -- have immune systems that have been sufficiently compromised to 
warrant treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the programs it plans to fund will vary according to the needs 
of each local community. "These may include local information campaigns; 
sponsored 'town hall meeting' with AIDS experts; funding much needed staff 
positions, such as counselors and case managers, or similar initiatives to 
communicate and implement early-intervention messages," the company said in a 
background statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in the initial stages of sitting down and chatting with people to 
determine their needs," said Lisa Behrens of Burroughs' corporate affairs 
department. She said the company, which sold $142 million worth of AZT in the 
fiscal six-month period ended March 3, hasn't set a budget for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Burroughs opted to work through AIDS and community groups after 
focus groups of gay men in cities around the country revealed a reservoir of 
ill will toward the company for its pricing practices. Burroughs had earlier 
planned to bypass the local organizations and conduct its own public service 
campaign urging people at risk to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things our research showed was that we should be supporting local 
organizations," said spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett, though she noted that current 
plans still leave room for a Burroughs-sponsored advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction of community groups was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in early intervention, and a necessary condition for that to occur 
is for people to know whether they are infected," said Larry Tate, hot line 
manager for Project Inform, a clearinghouse for HIV treatment information. "It 
doesn't matter what Burroughs' motivation is," Tate added. "The cause is good." 
</P>
<P>
"It is important for people at risk to know their status," added Jackie 
Gelfand, director of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services 
Center's anonymous HIV testing clinic. "But if they really wanted to increase 
access to early intervention, they could lower the price (of AZT)."

ARCO CHEMICAL ANNOUNCES NEW FAT SUBSTITUTE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD: OTHER FIRMS ARE AHEAD ON FAKE FATS. BUT THE MARKET COULD TOP $1 BILLION A 
YEAR, LEAVING LOTS OF ROOM FOR NEWCOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Arco Chemical Co. will weigh in with a new nondigestible fat substitute, 
joining the ranks of companies developing such products to satisfy 
health-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The company has already patented a formula for EPG -- esterified propoxylated 
glycerol, a chemical compound with properties similar to those of natural fats 
or oils but that is not absorbed by the body, said Thomas Beck, the Arco 
Chemical executive in charge of EPG's development. 
</P>
<P>
If it pans out, non-caloric EPG could replace oil or fat in everything from 
doughnuts to potato chips to ice cream. "We think this material will have a 
home and that there's a very big market," Beck said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the fat substitute, Arco Chemical joins Monsanto Co., which won 
Food and Drug Administration approval for its Simplesse fat substitute in 
February, and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which has been seeking FDA approval for 
its Olestra fat substitute for three years. All three companies are after a 
potential market of more than $1 billion, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
But Arco is several years behind its competitors, and FDA approval and 
commercial production of EPG is at least five years away, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
The development of EPG is part of Arco Chemical's new strategy of diversifying 
into products that can be made from its main chemical, propylene oxide, 
normally used to make everything from antifreeze to food additives to foam 
padding. At its annual meeting on Thursday, Arco Chemical President Harold A. 
Sorgenti set forth a five-year, $2.5-billion program to double the size of the 
company. Based in Newtown Square, Pa., Arco Chemical has about $2.7 billion in 
annual sales. The company is 83%-owned by Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
The entire chemical industry, hit hard recently by slack prices and falling 
sales in its core commodity-chemicals business, has been casting about for 
non-traditional markets, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole area of food ingredients is attracting a lot of interest, and it's 
part of the aging baby-boomer story," said chemical industry analyst James H. 
Wilbur with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. "Who else is 
better equipped to make these things than the chemical industry?" 
</P>
<P>
Besides chemical companies, more traditional food firms such as the Kraft 
General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. and the Frito-Lay unit of Pepsico are 
investigating fake fats. Everyone hopes to siphon off some of what Beck 
estimated is an annual demand for about 16 billion pounds of fats and oils in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But it's unclear how soon any of the products will actually end up on a dinner 
plate. Procter &amp; Gamble admits that the FDA approval process is taking 
longer than hoped, with no approval in sight after three years. "We don't know 
why," sighed Procter &amp; Gamble spokesman Don P. Tassone in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Beck said Arco Chemical has been cooking up EPG for the past three years. The 
company is now conducting safety tests and examining EPG's stability and 
usefulness in a variety of products. Application for FDA approval is at least 
three years away, he added. Arco Chemical would then look at a variety of 
business arrangements, including possible partnership with a major food 
company, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the competition, he argued that EPG will have broader applications than 
Simplesse, a compound of egg white and milk proteins that can only be used in 
cold foods such as salad dressings, ice cream and mayonnaise. Like Olestra, an 
unrelated chemical compound made from sucrose and soybean oil, EPG is for both 
hot and cold foods. 
</P>
<P>
Beck insisted that Arco Chemical will not suffer from its relatively late entry 
into the fat war. "We think there is room for other people in the marketplace," 
he said.

TOSHIBA PLANS TO TRIPLE JOBS AT IRVINE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Toshiba America Information Systems Inc. has accelerated its year-old expansion 
at its main Irvine plant because of brisk demand for its products and expects 
to nearly triple employment there to 2,400 people by March, 1992, the company's 
president said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kiichi Hataya, president of the U.S. subsidiary of Tokyo-based Toshiba Corp., 
said in an interview that the expansion is due to acceptance of Toshiba's 
products as well as the Japanese parent firm's long-term strategy to shift 
manufacturing of products sold in the U.S. market to the United States from 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The company currently employs 879 people at its Irvine manufacturing operation, 
which produces laptop computers, business telephones, facsimile machines, 
office copiers and cellular phones. It previously had expected to boost 
employment to 1,800, but strong sales now will kick that figure up another 600 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The company expects to employ 3,000 people throughout its U.S. operations by 
early 1992, up sharply from earlier estimates of 2,200. The unit's current U.S. 
employment is 1,560 people. Besides operations in Irvine, the company also has 
a facility in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Hataya also said the company plans to manufacture in Irvine a new lightweight 
"laptop-type engineering workstation," introduced earlier this week by its 
parent in Tokyo. The new machine will hit the Japanese market in July and will 
probably reach the U.S. market early next year, Hataya said. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba opened its information systems unit in 1981. Spurred by the threat of a 
ban on Toshiba imports as a result of trade violations in 1987, as well as the 
corporation's strategy to establish manufacturing operations on all major 
continents, the company has shifted more production to the United States in the 
past several years.

PERRIER RECALL CAUSES PROFIT TO PLUMMET 75% FOR 1989

Source Perrier SA said Friday that the costs associated with the recent recall 
of its popular bottled sparkling water were assessed to last year's account, 
resulting in a 75% plunge in earnings for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The company said net profit totaled $47 million for the year, compared to $185 
million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier recalled its bottled water worldwide in February after tests showed 
traces of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, in its product in several 
countries. The contamination came from improper infiltration of carbon dioxide 
gas added to the water, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier put the cost of the recall at $78 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it put aside part of its 1989 profit to cover the recall 
expense, which is permitted under French law. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier said it had expected to cover most of the recall costs with 
nonrecurring gains from the sale of assets, but these totaled only $45 million 
for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Perrier's 1988 results were boosted by much more substantial 
nonrecurring gains of $154 million, reflecting the sale of assets that included 
television, confectionary and milk interests. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier recently began resupplying its distributors with bottles marked 
"Nouvelle (New) Production."

Dozens of central Florida newspaper readers knew they had spotted a bargain 
when they saw the Pan Am ad offering a one-way flight to Nuremberg, West 
Germany, for $109. 
</P>
<P>
Oops. The advertisement should have said $409. 
</P>
<P>
But never mind, Pan Am went ahead and honored the erroneously advertised price 
for about 75 people who wanted tickets Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the ad promised "A lot of Europe for not a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
The deal on the fare, made possible by the mistake of a New York printing 
company, ended at noon Thursday. Company officials said the error appeared only 
in an ad in the Orlando Sentinel. The printer said it would pay the difference.

NEA SUPPORT IS ERODING, ARTS PANEL WARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The advisory board to the National Endowment for the Arts was warned here 
Friday that support for the NEA within the largest arts advocacy unit in 
Congress may have been dangerously eroded. 
</P>
<P>
The situation prompted members of the National Council on the Arts and key arts 
support groups to observe -- many for the first time publicly -- that the 
situation poses potentially fatal new political problems for the beleaguered 
arts agency. 
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued to the council by Julie Davis, the NEA's general 
counsel, who said she drew her conclusions about increased political risk for 
the endowment from a briefing last week conducted by four top NEA officials for 
members of the bipartisan Congressional Arts Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
The caucus, with about 250 members in the House and Senate, has traditionally 
been a crucial source of support for the NEA. But Davis said the withering 
political controversy that has beset the arts agency has apparently taken its 
toll even among the NEA's most important congressional advocates. 
</P>
<P>
There is, said Davis, "a handful who are still solidly behind us," but, even in 
the arts caucus, she said, "I don't think there is very strong, broad-based 
support." 
</P>
<P>
The assessment caused serious new concern among the arts council over whether 
the agency can survive a running battle over its legislative renewal in 
anything close to its present form. NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer 
acknowledged the uncertainty of the situation, adding a warning of his own that 
the situation "is in a tremendous state of flux right now" and that, in terms 
of reliable support for the NEA in Congress, "there is not a lot of solid 
ground up there." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, it was learned that Frohnmayer has asked officials 
of half a dozen key arts support groups to advise him on changes in the NEA 
structure under which the endowment would limit itself to making grants of 
$30,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer reportedly made the request in a private, unscheduled meeting here 
Thursday night. It was learned that he has asked individual arts advisers for 
their opinions on limiting NEA support to $100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear, however, whether Frohnmayer was seeking to build a consensus 
for a last-ditch defensive position from which to make the NEA's last stand or 
if he had some other reason for seeking the arts groups' advice. Frohnmayer was 
not available to reporters during the daytime council meeting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The alteration in grant policy would turn over to state and local arts agencies 
the authority for awarding perhaps more than 90% of the total number of grants 
given by the NEA. The agency made 3,900 separate grants last year and endowment 
officials said Friday that a survey several days ago had found that 87.5% of 
all NEA grants are for $50,000 or less -- indicating that the total below 
$30,000 would be significantly greater. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA's total budget for 1990 is about $171 million. Grant officials 
emphasized that, while the number of such individual grants is high, larger 
arts organizations receive the majority of the total money awarded. 
</P>
<P>
The request by Frohnmayer was apparently linked to a plea for the private 
arts-support groups to consider in principle the concept of transferring to 
state arts councils authority to make direct spending decisions over greatly 
expanded portions of the NEA budget. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal on which Frohnmayer sought the advice was said by sources to be 
nearly identical to a plan under discussion by a small group of Republican 
congressmen. The plan has already led to outraged reactions among a number of 
key arts support organizations, which see it as an abandonment of individual 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Such artists, on the cutting edges of a variety of media, receive many of the 
NEA's comparatively small grants. Yet they are widely perceived as the most 
risky grant recipients since their work often is the most directly provocative 
and politically risky material the NEA supports. 
</P>
<P>
Arts advocates were outraged by the role played in Republican analysis of the 
National Assn. of State Arts Agencies' proposal to shift more than half of the 
NEA's money back to the states. The association represents the state art 
councils and for several years has pursued its own agenda of trying to increase 
the political and financial clout of the state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
It was learned that council member Lloyd Richards, dean of the Yale Drama 
School, had written to officials of the state arts council group castigating 
them for breaking ranks with the arts community at what many art advocates 
consider the most dangerous moment for the NEA since it was founded 25 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Zeisler, director of the Theatre Communications Group, who a day before 
accused the National Assn. of State Arts Agencies of a "double-cross," released 
a letter to Jonathan Katz, the association's executive director, accusing it of 
attempting to engineer a self-interested coup under circumstances that are 
"inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
The pessimistic analysis of the NEA's political support base in the House and 
Senate touched off a new round of intense discussion within the arts council, 
whose members have discussed the agency's crisis regularly for the last year 
but taken few forceful political or policy positions to back up their concern. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Jacob Neusner complained of "a hot, dry wind that is melting 
support that we thought was solid." And Neusner, for the first time in a public 
NEA council meeting, gave voice to the possibility that the agency might not 
survive in its present form -- a prospect that observers familiar with the 
situation have said privately has become a far more realistic possibility than 
arts advocates would like. 
</P>
<P>
Neusner posed a series of questions predicated on the contention that "if, by 
next November, there is no endowment, which is a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
New York State Sen. Roy Goodman, a Bush Administration Republican who has 
established himself as one of the most passionate advocates of an unfettered 
NEA in the country, said he was increasingly concerned about "an atmosphere of 
panic and hysteria of the type that is now evident in the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
He called the political imbroglio that arose from objections by conservative 
politicians and organizations to a handful of controversial work funded by the 
endowment "an outrage similar to things that happened during the McCarthy era" 
and concluded, "make no mistake -- this endowment is being smeared."

CANNES MAKES HIS DAY; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: CLINT EASTWOOD'S 'WHITE HUNTER' IS HIS THIRD FILM TO BE PREMIERED AS AN 
OFFICIAL ENTRY IN THE FESTIVAL.

<P>
For the third time in seven years, a Clint Eastwood-directed movie has made its 
world premiere as an official entry in the Cannes Film Festival. Whether the 
third time proves a charm, Eastwood says he's charmed by the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here twice before and enjoyed it both times," Eastwood said, gazing out 
at a press conference crowd that was spilling out of a beachfront ballroom. "It 
was a wonderful, responsible time, so it was fun to be invited back." 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood has been one of Hollywood's most popular exports for nearly three 
decades and though neither "Pale Rider" nor "Bird" -- his previous Cannes 
entries -- earned him a prize, the films were huge successes with the 
international audiences here. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction to "White Hunter, Black Heart," a film based on the late director 
John Huston's obsession with elephant hunting during the preproduction of "The 
African Queen," seemed much more subdued, even though dozens of journalists 
jostled for position to get the director's autograph after the hourlong press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter," which premiered Friday night, will be perceived as one of 
Eastwood's "other movies" -- those that Warner Bros. patiently endures while 
waiting for his next "Dirty Harry." The list of Eastwood indulgences includes 
some of his best -- if least commercial -- films: "Bronco Billy," "Honky Tonk 
Man" and "Bird." 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. is releasing "White Hunter" in France next week, but it won't 
reach U.S. theaters before September. 
</P>
<P>
In "White Hunter" Eastwood takes one of his longest stretches as an actor, 
portraying -- in voice and manner -- the middle-aged John Huston in the midst 
of a dangerous obsession. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is adapted from a 1953 novel written by Peter Viertel, who went to 
Africa with Huston in the late '40s to help complete the script for "The 
African Queen" and witnessed Huston's dissolve into near madness. 
</P>
<P>
Viertel, now 75 and living in Spain with his wife, Deborah Kerr, fictionalized 
the names of Huston, producer Sam Spiegel and himself in the book, and the 
tragic consequences of the director's action portrayed in both the book and the 
film were fabricated. That Huston's obsession with killing an elephant, the bad 
blood it caused between him and Viertel, and the jeopardy in which it placed 
production of what -- despite it all -- became a movie classic were all real. 
</P>
<P>
"John was a gifted filmmaker but he was also a supreme egotist," Viertel says. 
"He would get distracted by some personal whim and he would have his way no 
matter what." 
</P>
<P>
Viertel believes it was the opportunity to hunt big game that tempted Huston to 
take "The African Queen" assignment in the first place, and he treated everyone 
as a traitor who didn't share his passion for the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The author, who objected to the hunting of any big game, said he wrote the 
novel as an open letter to Huston, whom he believed was squandering his talents 
on his obsessions, and despite reviews that accused the author of back-stabbing 
his mentor, he said Huston liked the book. 
</P>
<P>
"He offered to sign a release before he'd even seen it," Viertel says. "After 
he read the first draft, he suggested a different ending, which I used, then he 
never mentioned the book to me again." 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood said it was Huston's abandonment of responsibility after having taken 
on the responsibility of making a movie that drew his interest in the project. 
And as it happened with "Bird," it was Eastwood's interest that brought a well 
traveled script before the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter" was shot last summer in Zimbabwe, with the cooperation of the 
government there. The film has a definite environmental slant, but Eastwood 
said he did not take on the project to make any environmental points. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood said he never met Huston, who died just after the "White Hunter" 
project got under way. And his portrayal of the venerated director may be the 
most discussed element of the film. Asked why he chose to play the fictional 
John Wilson in the distinct manner of the real John Huston, who is as well 
known to some people as an actor as he was as a director, Eastwood said "What's 
the point of doing it if you don't try to stretch yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
"White Hunter" is one of 18 films from 10 countries in competition for the Gold 
Palm. Among its rivals are two other American-financed films -- Alan Parker's 
"Come See the Paradise" and David Lynch's "Wild at Heart." Paul Schrader, who 
was here five years ago with "Mishima," will attend the world premiere of his 
"The Comfort of Strangers," the closing-night film being shown out of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The festival opened Thursday night with "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams," an 
impressionistic anthology of eight vignettes that the 80-year-old Japanese 
director said were adapted from his own remembered dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"Dreams," also a Warner Bros. film, opened in Paris on Friday and will be 
released in the United States sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Other noted filmmakers with pictures in the formal program here are France's 
Bertrand Tavernier and Jean Luc-Godard, Italy's Federico Fellini and Vittorio 
and Paolo Taviani, and Poland's Andrzej Wajda. 
</P>
<P>
The festival runs through May 21.

CLASSICS JAZZ KKGO-FM RATINGS; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: WHEN THE STATION SWITCHED FROM BOP TO THE THREE B'S, IT BEGAN A HEALING 
PROCESS FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC DEVOTEES. 
</P>

<P>
Saul Levine is feeling real jazzed these days -- even though jazz has nothing 
to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, the general manager and president of KKGO-FM (105.1), appears to have 
turned the fortunes of his radio station around -- with a little help from 
Bach, Beethoven and Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he angered a devoted audience in the process is of little 
consequence to him now. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, a soft-spoken radio veteran, staged one of the most controversial radio 
broadcast changes of recent years in January when he scrapped KKGO's 
30-year-old jazz format for an all-classical music format. 
</P>
<P>
He was denounced by jazz lovers as a traitor who snatched the only powerful 
local jazz station off the airwaves. But classical music fans embraced Levine 
as a savior who picked up the baton when KFAC-FM, the city's commercial 
classical station, expired, and rock station KKBT boomed on the air in its 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The decision seems to have paid off for Levine. The audience has increased. And 
the hate mail has decreased. 
</P>
<P>
He said the reversal was largely due to having fewer commercials than KFAC, the 
recruitment of longtime KFAC personalities Tom Dixon and Rich Capparela, and 
the programming of full classical works, not excerpts. 
</P>
<P>
At the time that KKGO dropped the be-bop, classical music fans needed more than 
a commercial radio station, said Capparela. They needed a healing. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, the classical music audience has really gone through a lot of 
grief," said Capparela, the station's morning announcer. "Having Tom and I on 
the same staff is a healing element for the rift and the change." 
</P>
<P>
Capparela was skeptical about coming on board KKGO. "I wasn't certain of the 
depth of Saul's commitment," he said. "But now I see he really believes in the 
format. It's like being home, being among friends." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wrath he incurred from jazz loyalists, Levine said he never worried 
about whether he was making the right move. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no doubt it would work," Levine said, sitting back comfortably in his 
spacious West Los Angeles office. "All we did was switch from one art form to 
another. We have a comfortable percentage of our former audience. I think 
people feel at home now with what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
But many listeners still are not feeling too homey with the new KKGO. 
</P>
<P>
"It's undeniable that they left a tremendous void," said Dale Jaffe, the owner 
of Le Cafe, a Sherman Oaks restaurant and jazz club. "He deserted one type of 
music for another. I'm a business man, so I can appreciate when a business 
person has to make a hard decision. But I'm personally angry about it, and I'm 
definitely not going to listen to it." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Cohn, vice president of sales and marketing for Chase Music Group, a jazz 
record label, said she didn't believe that KKGO was more successful as a 
classical station than a jazz station. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see what the ratings are after four quarters," Cohn said. 
"That would give a more accurate assessment of what's happening. I don't think 
it's changed that much." 
</P>
<P>
She added, "I'm very happy for classical music, but it's really sad for a city 
that has such an impact on jazz that there is not one commercial jazz station." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Levine's solution of programming all jazz on his AM station, KKJZ 
(540), has stopped the grumbling. That station, which is located in Hesperia, 
can barely be heard in Los Angeles without a special receiver. And most 
listeners have been unwilling to plunk down $150 to get the special box. 
</P>
<P>
Levine has heard all the criticisms about his switches and is aware of the 
continuing debate. But don't ask him if he feels guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"Feeling guilt is a poor way of dealing with reality," Levine said. "If the 
station could not pay its bills, it could not survive." 
</P>
<P>
Just maintaining the KKGO offices was costing $25,000 a month, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
"I love jazz. I worked hard for it," he said. "When a listener laments and says 
we were the greatest jazz station in America, I hope they think of the 30 great 
years we had together." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was a losing battle to keep jazz going. "It was a diminishing 
audience, and it's hard to comprehend why," Levine said, speaking slowly. "It 
seems that the growing popularity of jazz has led to the fragmentation of the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
It was too hard to satisfy listeners who wanted traditional jazz along with 
those who desired to hear more new-age and fusion jazz, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we heard about KFAC going under, we knew that concert music was too 
important an art form to be removed from the L.A. scene," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Levine is now hearing raves from classical fans. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Frey, president of the Committee for Classical Music, a listener advocate 
group, said he couldn't be happier with KKGO. "This station might even be 
better than KFAC was," Frey said. "It's kind of funny how one man, Saul Levine, 
can influence the cultural life of a whole city. It shows one man can make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Arbitron ratings released last month showed KKGO holding steady with its 1% 
increase in market share last quarter. Its ranking -- 24th place out of 44 
stations -- and its 1.4% market share remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 300,000 listeners a week tuned in to jazz, Levine said. But the 
audience has since grown to 430,000 listeners a week. 
</P>
<P>
Audibly and physically, KKGO has few traces of its jazz past. In the station's 
offices, posters commemorating the station's 25th anniversary of jazz 
programming hang on several walls. But all that could be heard on the station's 
speakers were sonatas and waltzes. 
</P>
<P>
The city's former commercial classical music mainstay, KFAC, was purchased in 
January, 1989, by Evergreen Media Corp. for $55 million, the most ever paid for 
a classical radio station. Despite being deluged with pleas and letters from 
KFAC listeners, rumors continued that the classical format was about to be 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The station changed to a rock format in September. When that format failed to 
draw a substantial audience, the station switched to an urban contemporary 
format, which is meeting with more success. 
</P>
<P>
When KFAC was going under, Levine came almost immediately to the rescue. In 
September, he programmed classical music in the morning and evening hours on 
KKGO, and jazz fans began to sing the blues. 
</P>
<P>
Before KFAC's demise, the station had been running announcements telling 
listeners to tune in to KUSC-FM (91.5) for classical programming. But several 
listeners were disenchanted with KUSC. They said the station was ignoring 
traditional classical standards and was trying too hard to attract a younger 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a horrible format,"' said Ellen Stern Harris, vice president of the 
Committee for Classical Music. "They talked more about music than they played. 
They would put on this New Age stuff, trying to attract yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
KUSC General Manager Wallace A. Smith said he was glad that KFAC listeners who 
had not found his station to their liking were happy with KKGO. He described 
his station as an operation that was reaching out to an audience that doesn't 
ordinarily listen to classical music. "We have a fresher approach," he said. He 
said the situation was like an "oldies station going against a more 
contemporary station." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he didn't feel the station was diminishing his audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good that people have an option," he said. "And it looks to me that their 
success has not been at our expense. There is a large enough universe to 
support two classical stations. It helps both of us when both of us are 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Levine said he was dedicated to presenting classical music in a way that "is 
acceptable to the established listener. But we want to attract the younger 
listener without driving away the old." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he would not play new age, light pops or "Star Trek." "We will 
have respect for serious music." 
</P>
<P>
He also hopes to soon make the jazz fans happy with him again. The Federal 
Communications Commission has granted a license which will enable Levine to 
move the KKJZ transmitter to Costa Mesa. He said the signal should be much 
stronger in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to preserve the culture," he said. "I'm just glad we didn't go to 
rock."

<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth annual "Comic Relief" benefit for the homeless brings stars and 
laughter to the small screen tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Hosted as in previous years by Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Billy 
Crystal, the five-hour comedy marathon begins at 8 p.m. on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
Among those scheduled to perform or pitch for funds at New York's Radio City 
Music Hall are Danny Aiello, Candice Bergen, George Carlin, Art Carney, Dana 
Carvey, Bill Cosby, New York Mayor David Dinkins, Jane Pauley, Joan Rivers, The 
Rockettes, The Simpsons and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 9 p.m., KCET Channel 28 begins a five-part series, "Skyscraper," 
which chronicles the construction of a 47-story office building on the former 
site of Madison Square Garden in mid-town Manhattan. The series examines and 
explains the design, financing and construction processes that turned a hole in 
the ground into the 770-foot-high Worldwide Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
And those die-hard fans of the low-rated CBS comedies "The Famous Teddy Z" and 
"City" will be happy to know that both series return to the network's schedule 
tonight. "Teddy Z," starring Jon Cryer, airs at 9 p.m., while Valerie Harper's 
"City" follows at 9:30 p.m. STEVE WEINSTEIN

<P>
For most Southland sports fans, all other weekend sporting events will be 
taking a back seat to the Laker telecasts today and Sunday on Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday afternoon, the Lakers will have regained the home court in their NBA 
Western Conference semifinal series against the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Both games begin at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will also broadcast two Eastern Conference semifinal games. The New York 
Knicks face the Detroit Pistons at 10 a.m. today while the Philadelphia 76ers 
play host to the Chicago Bulls at 10 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
There also is plenty of televised baseball this weekend in what is shaping up 
to be a disappointing season for all three Southland teams. The Dodgers visit 
the New York Mets at 10:30 a.m. today and Sunday on KTTV Channel 11 and cable 
station WWOR. The underachieving Angels, one of many teams threating to become 
the Bart Simpsons of baseball, are on SportsChannel tonight for a 7 p.m. 
telecast against the Boston Red Sox. The Padres, continuing their tradition of 
slow starts, meet those recent Dodger tormentors, the Montreal Expos, at 7 p.m. 
tonight on San Diego Cable Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Two races also receive plenty of air time this weekend. ABC begins three 
weekends of coverage of the Indianapolis 500, with time trial telecasts today 
(1 p.m., Channels 7, 3 and 42; noon, Channel 10) and Sunday (1 p.m., Channels 
7, 3, 10 and 42). ESPN will also carry the time trials Sunday at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Tour de Trump, modestly billed by organizers as America's premier cycling 
event, concludes this weekend. NBC has telecasts today (1 p.m., Channels 4 and 
36, noon Channel 39) and Sunday (1 p.m., Channels 4, 36 and 39). STEVEN HERBERT

BUD CORT'S VOICE AND INVECTIVE SUGGEST A CALL FROM CAPOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The voice is raspy and reedy, like a crone's, and the bitchiness showered on 
everybody is outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
This is radio, folks, and the actor is Bud Cort, bringing you the voice and 
invective of Truman Capote, who returns from the Great Divide to chat about his 
life and his friends (tonight, 8-9:30 p.m., KCRW, 88.9 FM). 
</P>
<P>
Robert Morse may be doing Capote on Broadway in "Tru," but Cort's uncanny 
impersonation of the high-pitched, self-destructive social and literary 
butterfly will make eyes out of your ears. Nobody could dish the dirt like 
Capote, and the intimacy of this Rabelaisian theater of the air suggests a 
personal phone call from Capote himself. 
</P>
<P>
The words, beginning with the beguiling line "Before I died . . . ," are all 
adapted from Lawrence Grobel's book and subsequent (unstaged) play, 
"Conversations With Capote." (Grobel taped interviews with Capote up to the 
time of the writer's death, at 59, six years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
Director Christopher Toyne intersperses vocal interludes from a few of the 
celebrity subjects whom Capote exuberantly gnashes (such as "the mean-spirited" 
Jacqueline Kennedy, "that old French queen, Gide" and the "jealous" Gore 
Vidal). Capote's rare compliments are for those he praises for favoring style 
over content (Billie Holiday, Flaubert). 
</P>
<P>
You want a crash course in writers? Glitz? Sleaze? "All literature is gossip," 
says Capote. You do come to understand why he lost many of his friends, and 
Capote does hint at "regret" for allowing those excerpts to be published from 
his last, unfinished tell-all manuscript, "Unanswered Prayers." 
</P>
<P>
But there are moments in Cort's performance when the thin voice breaks and 
Capote's frivolous mask disappears. When Cort's Capote talks about researching 
and writing "In Cold Blood" -- "the most emotional experience of my creative 
life" -- the artist emerges. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Capote even throws off his cloak of hedonism: "Actually, I was 
never that promiscuous. I didn't have the energy." You'll never hear this 
material on TV.

RICK DU BROW: FOR NETWORK CHIEFS, IT'S A PRIME-TIME MAALOX MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's crunch time. 
</P>
<P>
In network offices in Los Angeles and New York, the annual TV frenzy has set in 
-- picking the series for the fall season. 
</P>
<P>
Within 10 to 12 days, prime-time lineups will be unveiled. Grown men and women 
-- producers -- have been known to become ill, get drunk, throw fits, lock 
themselves in hotel rooms, if their shows don't make it. Millions of dollars, 
sometimes hundreds of millions -- if you have a series like "The Cosby Show" -- 
are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ulcer time," says an ABC executive. It's also a time for secretive phone 
calls, sudden friendliness and lavish ploys to woo influential network 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Party. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
As the networks' Big Three entertainment presidents -- Brandon Tartikoff of 
NBC, Bob Iger of ABC and Jeff Sagansky of CBS -- scrutinize the pilots and make 
or break producers with their decisions, their annual power is at its zenith. 
They're in a heady position. They dictate the distribution of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
But they'd better look around. They'd better take a good, hard look at their 
buildings, the lots, the offices -- and remember that nothing is permanent 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Stupid programming and new TV competition have cut network audiences by almost 
a third in the past decade -- down to little more than 60% of the national 
audience. A little more slippage -- down, say, to 50% -- and there may be 
viewers enough to support only two networks. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the feverish pilot selection was a kind of private, high-stakes, 
back-room poker game. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a new player. 
</P>
<P>
The public. 
</P>
<P>
It has delivered a mandate -- an ultimatum -- to the Big Three networks. 
</P>
<P>
And Tartikoff, Sagansky and Iger know it. They've gotten the message of public 
impatience, ridicule and even disgust over prime-time TV. 
</P>
<P>
They've seen total breakout shows like Fox's "The Simpsons" and ABC's "Twin 
Peaks" capture the imagination of parched viewers. 
</P>
<P>
The word from Madison Avenue is that there are more unique, even bizarre, 
pilots than in years -- like Steven Bochco's musical police drama, "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
But there are crosscurrents. Tartikoff's NBC is No. 1 and still rolling in the 
ratings, but the network's owner, General Electric, is a hard taskmaster when 
it comes to making its divisions show profits. It wouldn't tolerate another 
decade-long slump like the one that preceded "The Cosby Show," according to 
sources at the highest levels. 
</P>
<P>
Can Tartikoff afford to gamble under GE? Is that why NBC's reputation for 
innovation has plummeted since GE bought it? Still TV's greatest showman, 
Tartikoff is upset over the critics' new perception of NBC as a nervous No. 1. 
And there's only one solution. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
Same problem for CBS. Also controlled by a non-showman, Laurence Tisch, it's 
become almost a bare-bones network as divisions, including its hugely 
profitable record company, have been sold off and a lack of programming 
know-how has put it in the cellar. Even Tisch this week called CBS prime time 
"a total disaster." 
</P>
<P>
That's hopeful honesty from Tisch, the CBS president. But will he continue to 
interfere in creative decisions for which he's eminently unqualified? 
Sagansky's caught in the middle, too -- go for safe formula series or go for 
broke. He'd better go for broke, or CBS just might be the network that 
disappears in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers, not Tisch, will determine Sagansky's future. 
</P>
<P>
So gamble. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's Iger is in a strange position. With most of the innovative, admired and 
talked-about network series in recent years -- from "Moonlighting" to 
"thirtysomething" to "Twin Peaks" -- ABC is in danger of being killed with 
kindness by admirers. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, because of its creative track record, ABC is expected to be more noble 
than its competitors, and heaven help it if it cancels such borderline ratings 
performers as "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff and his former boss at NBC, Grant Tinker, once basked in this kind of 
adoration. As one splendid series followed another on NBC -- "Hill Street 
Blues," "Cheers" and "St. Elsewhere," to name a few -- Tinker almost found it 
necessary to apologize for crass commercial hits like "The A-Team," which 
helped carry the network. 
</P>
<P>
Tinker repeatedly tried to sidestep the "noble" label, explaining that you also 
had to get down and dirty to run a business like a network. And Iger faces the 
same crisis of adulation as "The Wonder Years" and "Twin Peaks" find themselves 
supported by production-line sausage like "Family Matters," "Full House" and 
"Just the Ten of Us." 
</P>
<P>
Even ABC's problematic ratings entries like "China Beach," "Anything but Love" 
and "Twin Peaks" -- not to mention the glorious failure, "Elvis" -- are vastly 
more interesting than zeroes like "A Family for Joe" and "Jake and the Fatman." 
</P>
<P>
But amid its embarrassment of riches, has anyone noticed that ABC, with its 
continued experimenting, is suddenly last in the critical May ratings sweeps -- 
while Tartikoff's much-put-upon NBC has found yet more new winners: Carol 
Burnett's "Carol &amp; Company" and "Wings"? 
</P>
<P>
Has ABC's bubble quietly burst? What is the network to do as it poises itself 
for a run at top-ranked NBC? It has no choice. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
That's what got it this far, and any noticeable change in attitude in its new 
fall lineup would cost it almost everything it has won in terms of reputation. 
</P>
<P>
This is a great time for TV viewers. When the fall lineups are announced, 
they'll have a clear picture of whether Tartikoff, Iger and Sagansky have 
reacted to the audience rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really need any more buddy cop series? Is it written in stone that we 
regularly have to get our dose of by-the-numbers sitcoms like "Down Home" and 
"Working Girl"? Do programmers truly believe that the world is waiting for more 
non-purpose newsmagazines such as "PrimeTime Live"? 
</P>
<P>
If so, then it's time to re-examine the entire network system. And presumably 
that's what Sagansky, Iger and Tartikoff are smart enough to be doing as they 
make their fall choices. 
</P>
<P>
They must ask themselves: Is there really a public demand for endless 
potboilers like "Father Dowling Mysteries"? And have network arteries hardened 
so much that a fine pilot like "Shannon's Deal" then has to be squeezed into a 
formula series? And isn't it clear why the shows that people talk about are 
class acts like "Murphy Brown" and "L.A. Law"? 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Fox. The exciting, young Fox network. Just 3 1/2 years old, it 
has turned the TV industry on its ear -- and, most important, sensed the desire 
for freshness -- with the hip cartoon sensation "The Simpsons," "Married . . . 
With Children" and "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, like ABC, is gambling. Will all the networks see that there is no other 
way, or will they hasten their suicidal paralysis? We'll know in just days. 
</P>
<P>
It's up to Tartikoff, Iger and Sagansky. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't act on the public mandate, the lessons down the road will be 
harsh.

BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most Buddhists observe the birthday of Siddhartha Gautama Buddha (circa 560-480 
BC) in May, although the dates vary according to ethnic tradition and 
scheduling convenience. Also called the Wesak festival, and commemorating the 
Buddha's enlightenment as well, it is often celebrated on dates closest to the 
full moon. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Buddhists observe the holiday in April, but some of their clergy take 
part in the pan-Buddhist observances in May. 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: Siddhartha Gautama, son of a wealthy member of the Sakya clan, was 
said to have been born at Lumbini near the present border of India and Nepal. 
Protected in his youth from suffering, the young prince later saw the troubling 
side of life and left his family to seek the right spiritual path, eventually 
becoming a Buddha, or "Enlightened One." 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVANCES: A joint Los Angeles-area celebration will be held today at Wat 
Thai Temple in North Hollywood, starting at 9:30 a.m. Candles, flowers and 
incense are offered and the baby Buddha is ritually bathed in a service 
reflecting the legend of the religious founder's birth. Thai, Sri Lankan, 
Cambodian and Laotian monks will pay homage to the Buddha and then Chinese, 
Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Tibetan and Anglo-American monks will take part 
in chanting. A seminar on clergy-laity relationships, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., 
will feature talks by Sri Lankan Abbot Walpola Piyananda and the Rev. Masao 
Kodani of Senshin Buddhist Church.

<TEXT>
<P>
Australian biologist Charles Birch, co-recipient this week of the $684,000 
Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, said he will donate part of his share 
to a religious philosophy center based at the School of Theology at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The donation was confirmed by John B. Cobb Jr., founder-director of the 
17-year-old Center for Process Studies, who said it will be used to establish 
an endowment fund. "It gives us much greater confidence that we can keep 
going," said Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Templeton Prize was presented Tuesday in London by Prince Philip to 
Indian lawyer Baba Amte, 75, a Hindu whose work for the sick crosses India's 
religious divisions, and Birch, 72, a retired Sydney professor who has explored 
links between science and religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian was praised as an "original thinker (who) uses modern 
discoveries in natural science to expand man's understanding of God as designer 
and creator of the universe and its creatures." 
</P>
<P>
Birch said he will use his prize to fund an annual lecture at the University of 
Sydney on human aspects of science and technology and a Christian social ethics 
project in Geneva as well as helping the Claremont center. The Methodist layman 
has served as vice chairman of the World Council of Churches' Church and 
Society committee. 
</P>
<P>
Birch, co-author with Cobb of a book titled "The Liberation of Life," is 
scheduled to appear at a seminar from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday at the School of 
Theology at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb said he was not free to disclose the amount of the expected donation. 
</P>
<P>
Some concern had arisen on the research center's future because of the 
approaching retirement of Cobb, a world-renowed theologian. Cobb retires from 
the seminary faculty next month. Although he will stay with the center and do 
some teaching in Claremont, he will also lighten some of his duties. 
</P>
<P>
Process studies focus on the philosophy of the late mathematician-physicist 
Alfred North Whitehead and other scholars who have interpreted and applied his 
insights to a unifying theory of life, the nature of deity and the universe. 
</P>
<P>
The center has attempted to apply Whitehead's metaphysical views in conferences 
and seminars to practical problems of interfaith dialogue, environmental 
problems and, most recently, male sexuality. The center also publishes a 
scholarly journal and is working on a film project for television, Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Frederick J. Beebe, who will turn 64 in October, will retire Jan. 1 as 
executive of the 122,200-member Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and 
Hawaii. Beebe, a former pastor in Claremont, has held the top synod post since 
1978. The synod, which embraces 310 congregations, will convene next Saturday 
at Westminster Gardens in Duarte to conduct its first semiannual meeting this 
year.

The interfaith VISN cable television network, launched in September, 1988, is 
reportedly seen, for at least part of each day, on 10 cable systems in Southern 
California. Last Saturday, about 50 people from some of the 22 religious bodies 
that contribute to VISN's nationwide programming met in Pasadena to coordinate 
lobbying efforts to expand the list. Nelson Price, newly elected president and 
chief executive officer of the New York-based network, spoke to the meeting. 
Interfaith cooperation is still a new venture for some organizers, however. 
Because the gathering was on a Saturday, Jewish and Muslim representatives did 
not attend. A second planning meeting is scheduled for Thursday, June 7.

RARE ALLIANCE ASKS COURT TO RECONSIDER DRUG RULING

An unusual coalition of religious groups has asked the Supreme Court to 
reconsider its decision allowing states to outlaw the use of illegal drugs as a 
religious practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I seriously doubt these groups have ever been in the same room together, much 
less have ever joined in so important an undertaking," Oliver Thomas of the 
Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs told reporters Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The April 17 high court ruling said members of the Native American Church had 
no constitutional right to take the hallucinogenic drug peyote during religious 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the American Jewish Congress, the National Assn. of Evangelicals 
and the National Council of Churches also participated in a news conference 
held after the petition for rehearing was filed with the court. 
</P>
<P>
Others supporting the petition included the Presbyterian Church USA, Lutheran 
Church-Missouri Synod, American Friends Service Committee, Americans United for 
Separation of Church and State and the Christian Legal Society. 
</P>
<P>
Religious leaders were more disturbed by the court's method of deciding the 
case than by the decision's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Five members of the 6-3 court majority agreed that religious beliefs cannot 
excuse failure to comply with "otherwise valid laws prohibiting conduct states 
are free to regulate." 
</P>
<P>
Departing from a long series of prior cases, the court did not require states 
to have a "compelling reason" before forcing someone to comply with laws 
interfering with religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The court's new reasoning, said Robert P. Dugan Jr. of the National Assn. of 
Evangelicals, "effected a sea change in freedom-of-religion law." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Siegman of the American Jewish Congress said that if the decision 
remains, "all Americans . . . will have reason to feel less free and more 
vulnerable under our Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
The court rarely grants requests for reconsideration, and Thomas acknowledged 
Thursday's move was "a long shot." 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, it is our only shot," he said.

A Baptist minister said church officials should quit complaining about 
declining membership, stop telling the faithful "thou shalt not" and start 
having some fun instead. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Campolo, president of Evangelicals for Social Action in Pennsylvania, 
offered the advice this week to 1,300 participants at the National Evangelism 
Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
The Bible is not as humorless as many churches portray it, Campolo said. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus said the kingdom is like a wedding reception and he's the bridegroom. 
Jesus was Jewish, which is almost as good as Italian," he said. "They know how 
to throw a wedding."

DRUG STING IN ANAHEIM NETS JUDGE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: POLICE WERE TIPPED OFF EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THE MUNICIPAL 
COURT COMMISSIONER WAS USING COCAINE ON A 'REGULAR BASIS.'

<P>
Capping a six-month investigation, Anaheim police said Friday that they caught 
an Orange County traffic judge in a sting operation and arrested him on 
suspicion of cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they received a tip earlier this year that Municipal Court 
Commissioner Robert K. Tuller Jr., 46, based in the Fullerton courthouse, used 
cocaine on a "regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
That information prompted an investigation by members of the Anaheim police 
force, the district attorney's office and state Bureau of Narcotics 
Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Tuller was invited by undercover agents to a "party" at the Anaheim Sheraton 
hotel Friday, police said. When Tuller allegedly bought an unspecified quantity 
of cocaine from an undercover agent with the state Bureau of Narcotics 
Enforcement, the arrest was made, according to a statement put out by Anaheim 
Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy. 
</P>
<P>
After being booked, Tuller posted bail of $5,000 and was released on his own 
recognizance at 4 p.m. by Municipal Judge Margaret Anderson, the presiding 
judge in the Fullerton courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Tuller, leaving his home Friday night with a man he identified as his attorney, 
said when asked about the charges: "I don't know anything about it. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
A lifetime Fullerton resident, Tuller was a deputy marshal in the North County 
Municipal Court in Fullerton, then practiced law in private practice for 13 
years. He was appointed to the bench as a court commissioner by North Court 
municipal judges in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He took the bench as a commissioner on July 7 of that year. With the exception 
of some restrictions in serious felony cases, a court commissioner essentially 
carries out the same day-to-day duties as judges.

UC IRVINE PAYS LAST RESPECTS TO ITS FIRST LEADER; 
</P>
<P>
MEMORIAL: 'CHANCELLOR DAN' IS HONORED IN THE GARDEN HE CALLED THE HEART OF THE 
UNIVERSITY. HIS SUCCESSOR SAYS ALDRICH WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE IN ITS HEART.

<P>
He was remembered as a gregarious and compassionate man of the soil, a fierce 
competitor and a builder of human bridges who, through vision and force of 
personality, created and molded a thriving university that aspires to 
greatness. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of UC Irvine founding chancellor Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., who died last 
month at 71 after a long battle with cancer, two citrus trees were dedicated 
Friday in the rock garden he had chosen to be the university's heart. 
</P>
<P>
There were many moist eyes among the more than 350 colleagues, friends and 
family of the man known affectionately as "Chancellor Dan" when his successor, 
UCI Chancellor Jack Peltason, read the inscription placed at the foot of the 
rocky outcropping in Aldrich Park: 
</P>
<P>
"May these rocks be so regarded: That the right man came here at the right time 
and from this bare ground built a place as lasting." 
</P>
<P>
Those words were written by the late architect William Pereira in his memoir 
recalling how in December, 1961, the towering Aldrich strode the rolling 
expanse of the Irvine Ranch until he spotted the craggy outcropping in a 
bowl-shaped depression. Instantly, he declared it the spot around which the 
fledgling university would take shape. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the heart of (UCI)," Peltason said as sunlight streamed over his 
shoulder through tall eucalyptus, sycamore and pine trees ringing the central 
greensward. "It is the place where those of us . . . have had occasion to come 
and to dream and to build. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Dan wanted us to continue to build. He did not want us to spend a moment in 
mourning. No sadness, no tears. He asked that we continue to look forward . . . 
(to focus) on UCI and what it will become," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 25 years after the first freshman entered its doors, UCI has become "one 
of the most respected campuses in the country," University of California 
President David P. Gardner said in a letter read by UC Vice President William 
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
A soil chemist when he began his career with the University of California 
citrus experiment station in Riverside in 1943, he became the UC system's dean 
of agriculture in 1958. Four years later, he was named chancellor of UCI, which 
held its first classes in September, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
A native of New Hampshire who never lost his Yankee accent, Aldrich was 
instrumental in recruiting top-flight scholars such as the co-discoverer of the 
neutrino, Frederick Reines, brain scholar James L. McGaugh and ozone layer 
expert F. Sherwood Rowland. By the time he retired in 1984, UCI had vaulted 
into the ranks of top of American universities. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich's retirement was short-lived, however. The same year, UC President 
Gardner tapped the man he dubbed his "utility chancellor" to take over UC 
Riverside upon the death of its leader, Tomas Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich served at Riverside until July, 1985. In July, 1986, Gardner again 
brought him out of retirement to take over UC Santa Barbara, when Chancellor 
Robert A. Huttenback resigned amid accusations of misusing university funds. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich left Santa Barbara in June, 1987, and was named chancellor emeritus at 
UCI, where he kept an office and stayed active in academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Krisman, member of UCI's first graduating class of 1969 and former 
UCI student body president during the days of draft-card burnings, sit-ins and 
anti-war protests, recalled Aldrich's honesty and appreciation for new ideas, 
even those he did not agree with. 
</P>
<P>
During one demonstration, Aldrich telephoned him and asked, " 'Michael, how 
long are the students planning to live in the English Department? Let's talk 
about it.' . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In a time of antiheroes, Dan believed in setting an example. In a time of 
questioning values, Dan knew there were eternal truths. In a time of practiced 
cynicism, Dan was an optimist . . . (who) saw and expected the best in people." 
</P>
<P>
For Irvine Co. vice president Ray Watson, who was a young architect charged 
with building the planned community of Irvine around the University of 
California campus, Dan Aldrich was a builder of bridges -- between the 
institution and the development firm, between people and communities. 
</P>
<P>
"He built a solid bridge to a conservative Orange County that was skeptical, if 
not hostile, to the idea that a liberal institution from Berkeley was locating 
here," Watson said. "He taught us what can be achieved through communication, 
cooperation, mutual respect and bold ideas . . . to achieve the greatest good 
for the most people." 
</P>
<P>
At the last, Aldrich accepted his illness and was prepared to "get on with it," 
his widow, Jean, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Gazing into the faces of those assembled on the grassy knoll, she recalled the 
simple, direct man whose life was devoted to making the world in which he lived 
a cleaner, better, happier place: 
</P>
<P>
"I would venture to guess that on the road to heaven, if he saw one small gum 
wrapper, he stopped and picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason, who was UCI vice chancellor for academic affairs in the university's 
earliest years, invited all to share Aldrich's vision. 
</P>
<P>
"This (campus) is his monument. Most of all, end your day doing what Dan would 
want you to do: sit on the grass, perch on a bench and dream. . . . And for 
heaven's sake, don't forget to pick up any litter you may see lying about. 
Remember, Dan is watching."

HEARING: A MURDER TRIAL IS SCHEDULED AFTER WITNESSES DESCRIBE THE NIGHT A 
3-YEAR-OLD WAS STABBED TO DEATH BY A MEMBER OF JACOB'S WELL CHRISTIAN CENTRE IN

When Michael R. Pacewitz walked into court in his yellow Orange County Jail 
jumpsuit Friday, he exchanged smiles with Joanne Boydston, the mother of the 
3-year-old girl he has said he killed on orders from Satan. 
</P>
<P>
"God told me to forgive him," said Boydston, who attended the same church as 
Pacewitz. "I had to. I was so tormented, it was the only way I could find 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz, 21, is charged with the stabbing death of Marcelline Onick, 
Boydston's daughter, in a Fullerton apartment the morning of March 3. Pacewitz 
is also charged with attempted murder in the stabbing attack the night before 
on his mother, Elena Fontaine, and her boyfriend, Juan Marin, at their Anaheim 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Boydston, clutching her Bible to her chest, listened intently during a 
preliminary hearing as Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown guided witnesses who 
described the night of terror. 
</P>
<P>
Boydston was composed until Fullerton Police Officer Linda King testified about 
finding the body. Overcome, she bolted from the courtroom and sobbed 
uncontrolably. 
</P>
<P>
She returned in time to hear Municipal Judge Stephen J. Sunvold bound Pacewitz 
over to stand trial in Superior Court on three counts: murder of the child and 
attempted murder of Fontaine and Marin. Sunvold scheduled that arraignment for 
May 24. 
</P>
<P>
Boydston, 25, has known Pacewitz and his family for years. She and Pacewitz had 
sat just a row apart at a revival meeting the Wednesday night before the 
killing at their church, Jacob's Well Christian Centre in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing Friday, Boydston was approached by Ron Pacewitz, 20, the 
defendant's brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Could I speak to you for just a minute?" he asked. She stepped to a side of 
the courtroom hallway with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Could I just . . . just have a hug?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Boydston folded her arms around Pacewitz, who was on the edge of tears. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's going to be all right," Boydston told him. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Marin testified through a Spanish interpreter that Michael 
Pacewitz came to his mother's home in Anaheim on Friday night, March 2, and 
soon afterward ordered his mother into the bedroom. Marin said he next heard 
screams and saw Pacewitz on the bed holding a knife. He was yelling at his 
mother, "You lied to me!" Marin testified. 
</P>
<P>
Marin said when he tried to intervene, Pacewitz hit him in the face and tried 
to stab him, then chased his mother onto the patio. 
</P>
<P>
When the blade on the kitchen knife became bent, Pacewitz returned to the 
kitchen for a second one, Marin said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz stabbed his mother several times, and struck and slashed Marin on the 
hands, authorities said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
By the time police were called, Pacewitz was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the first attack, Boydston and a girlfriend spotted Pacewitz 
standing at a gas station on Katella Avenue near Disneyland and offered him a 
ride. He accepted, saying nothing about what had just happened. Boydston said 
she did not suspect anything was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz was still in the car when Boydston got out at her Fullerton apartment. 
A short time later, Boydston left home for the evening. She left her daughter 
and 9-month-old son in the care of the baby boy's father, Wes Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"We were still close, and he had watched the children many times," she said 
about Robinson after Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Later Robinson left for the evening, leaving the children in the care of a 
next-door neighbor. Pacewitz, who was staying with the neighbor, then ended up 
baby-sitting the children alone when the neighbor also left. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz told The Times Orange County Edition that he killed the girl on orders 
from Satan but sat in the apartment for several hours while the children slept 
before making his final decision. 
</P>
<P>
He called Fullerton police from a pay telephone and told them that he had been 
high on crystal methamphetamine and "had done something wrong," according to 
Police Officer King's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
King said she met Pacewitz and found a butcher knife in his back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom Friday, Boydston said she was not sure what kind of 
punishment Pacewitz should be given. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope he gets the psychiatric help he so desperately cried out for," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the first time she had seen him since that night. She said her smile 
and soft "hello" to him had been spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that it was Satan who controlled him that night," she said. 
"because no human is capable of committing such a wicked deed."

Three high school seniors on Friday were named winners of a Serafines de Orange 
County public speaking contest that asked contestants to address the importance 
of education in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Saenz, a senior at El Modena High School in Orange, won the first prize of 
$700. The $600 second prize went to Westminster High School senior Angelica 
Villicana. And Karen Wasinger, a senior at Savanna High School in Anaheim, won 
the third prize of $500. 
</P>
<P>
Serafines is a nonprofit organization formed by the California Angels to 
promote education for Latinos, said Manuel Esqueda, the organization's 
president. On Thursday night, 25 college-bound Latino students spoke on the 
issue, "What does education mean to the Latino family?"

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LONG BEACH MAN IS KILLED IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach man was killed Friday when his car slammed into a bridge in Buena 
Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Baxter, 21, died at the scene following the 1:16 a.m. accident, said 
Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillen. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on Valley View Street south of Artesia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, who was alone in the car, apparently drifted across a lane and rammed 
into a concrete section of a bridge spanning a flood-control channel of Coyote 
Creek, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After crashing into the bridge, the 1990 Ford Probe slammed into a light pole, 
McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter died from massive head and internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation indicated that the man was driving at a minimum speed of 65 
m.p.h., police said.

<P>
Department of Motor Vehicles inspector John Rooney has seen lots of 
weird-looking vehicles before, but even he seemed intrigued by the 
banana-yellow racer that was hauled in by moving van to be registered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He walked around to the front, crouched near the plane-like nose and asked the 
driver behind the wheel a few questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Fuel?" he asked, looking at the standard DMV form. "Hmm. Guess it must be sun. 
They're going to love that one." 
</P>
<P>
A smog check was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The solar-powered vehicle, Solaris II, is a project of 10 UC Irvine mechanical 
engineering seniors who are competing in the annual Tour de Sol, a 234-mile 
road rally from Vermont to Massachusetts that features solar-powered cars built 
by college students from around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine team is poised to challenge the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, which usually dominates solar racing. 
</P>
<P>
"MIT is the equivalent of General Motors in solar-car racing," said Edward Fok, 
23. 
</P>
<P>
But they can't put the vehicle on the road until they register it. 
</P>
<P>
The students made an appointment at the Costa Mesa DMV office and, just as if 
it was any other car, they drove Solaris II around to the inspection station in 
the back of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The students paced nervously as Rooney looked over the three-wheeled car. 
</P>
<P>
"This is worse than going to the dentist," said Dixon Kim, 22, as he awaited 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Onlookers and DMV inspectors, perplexed at the cockpit-like canopy jutting out 
from a flat, 15-foot-long solar panel, stopped, stared and asked the students 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Chavez of Santa Ana watched the event with curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to the DMV with his brother, who was taking a driving test. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great idea," he said of solar-powered cars. "You don't have to 
spend money on gas or plugs. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The solar cells on the panel, which looks a bit like a huge circuit board, 
convert sunlight into electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine a gas tank," Kim said. "The solar panels are providing drops at a 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The students are optimistic that the car can reach a speed of 43 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping for more," Fok said. 
</P>
<P>
The 420-pound car, which looks like a small kayak with a door smashed over it, 
cost between $30,000 and $40,000 to build. 
</P>
<P>
Its transmission system is designed to moderate the car's speed so it can 
operate at peak efficiency without overheating. 
</P>
<P>
It has an accelerator, a steering wheel, a hand brake and two 36-volt batteries 
to store the electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The students started on the project last summer, modifying a vehicle built by 
another team of students last year. 
</P>
<P>
And this year's Solaris II will be converted into next year's Solaris III, with 
plans to replace the steel frame with a carbon-fiber composite, the stuff jet 
fighters are made from. 
</P>
<P>
After about 10 minutes of scrutiny, Rooney signed the form. Some of the 
students, elated, gave each other high fives. The tension broken, a couple of 
others raced off to class. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they had been up all night preparing for the registration and would 
celebrate with some sleep after getting a bite to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said that because the car has no fenders, bumpers, brake lights or turn 
signals, it probably wouldn't be accorded permanent registration. But the DMV 
would issue a temporary sticker. 
</P>
<P>
But with all the excitement, the students didn't remember to pick it up. The 
DMV said Friday they could come and and fetch it, after they paid the fee. 
</P>
<P>
Once they collect the sticker, though, it is still unlikely Solaris II will be 
seen tooling around local streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they would be pulled over," Rooney said. "I'd like to see the 
policeman's face. . . . It's not like I would see lots of them on the road."

GROUP TRIES TO LIMIT CITY COUNCIL TERMS 
</P>

<P>
A group of Newport Beach residents has begun a petition drive to limit City 
Council terms to two. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Newport Residents to Limit Council Terms filed the preliminary 
documents necessary to amend the City Charter. 
</P>
<P>
They plan to start collecting signatures by the end of next week, spokeswoman 
Janine Gault said. Amending the City Charter would require a referendum on the 
November ballot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the council's seven members -- Ruthelyn Plummer, Donald Strauss, John 
Cox and Evelyn Hart -- are in their third terms of office. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss and Hart are up for reelection in November, 1990. There is no limit now 
to the number of four-year terms that a City Council member may serve. 
</P>
<P>
The petition drive began because "a lot of people would like to run for the 
City Council, but choose not to run against incumbents," Gault said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to unseat anyone," Gault said, but believe "the two-term limit 
would be in the best interests of the community." 
</P>
<P>
The group has until July 1 to gather enough signatures from at least 15% of the 
43,322 registered voters in the city, she said. LAURA MICHAELIS

CITY EXPECTED TO HIRE OWN ARCHITECT FOR ARENA; 
</P>
<P>
ANAHEIM: A PROPOSAL AIMS TO GET THE STALLED PROJECT BACK ON SCHEDULE WHILE 
HOLDING DOWN COSTS.

<P>
In an effort to get back on a "fast track" with its 20,000-seat indoor sports 
arena, the city is expected to hire its own architect to draft new plans and 
hold construction costs below the $94 million quoted by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone at City Hall is pleased with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't be spending taxpayers' money until we have consummated a deal 
that we know is going to happen," said City Councilman Irv Pickler, the only 
council member to vote against the arena project. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James Ruth, who recommended the council approve the plan at its 
regular meeting Tuesday, said the change in architects would not affect the 
city's current arrangement with Ogden Corp. The city no longer has a 
contractual obligation to use Ogden as the arena developer, Ruth has said, but 
continues to negotiate with the New York-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
However, under a proposal on Tuesday's council agenda, the city would pay up to 
$425,000 to Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum Inc. (HOK) of Kansas City for the 
schematic design phase of the architectural services. HOK has designed the 
$70-million Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, the Bradley Center Arena in Milwaukee 
(home of pro basketball team Milwaukee Bucks) and the new Chicago White Sox and 
Baltimore Orioles baseball stadiums, now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
"The city seems to be coming up front with all the money," Pickler said. "All 
the responsibility seems to be falling on the city's shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
The full bill for the Anaheim Arena architectural services would be $3.6 
million, according to Ruth's report to the City Council. A developer, once 
having obtained construction financing for the project, would take over the HOK 
contract and repay the city, Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
"In this manner, it is possible for the project to proceed on schedule while 
the city completes its agreement with the arena developer," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to complete construction of the arena by the fall of 1992, the 
same timetable projected for another arena proposed in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Ogden could not be reached for comment Friday. But Ogden, which 
has feuded in recent months with the city over the stalled project, had 
previously hired the HNTB architectural firm, which has completed interior and 
exterior renderings of the project. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Ogden has no objection to the city hiring a different firm 
to design the facility. Ron Rothschild, Anaheim's director of administrative 
services, said he expects HOK to develop a project that will improve the design 
of the arena as well as reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
City officials began to object to Ogden's arena proposal earlier this year when 
construction bids came in at $94 million, about $9 million more than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we have a number that we consider to be tolerable," Rothschild 
said of the construction costs. "We're expecting it to come under what the 
other design cost . . . by a significant amount." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials offered no explanation Friday for why the city, rather than 
Ogden, will advance the costs for the new architect. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't answer why (Ogden) isn't paying it," Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Anaheim Arena still must clear significant hurdles posed by 
three lawsuits filed by the Los Angeles Rams, Anaheim Stadium Associates and 
Campanula Properties, the owner of a mobile home park adjacent to the arena 
site on Douglass Road and Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Jack White will ask the city attorney on Tuesday to approve 
out-of-court settlements in the suits, which have halted arena construction and 
site preparation. White said that as of late Friday, an agreement had been 
reached in only one of the suits -- the one involving the Rams -- but he was 
hopeful that settlements could be reached on the others by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
White said a tentative agreement with the Rams would prohibit arena events from 
beginning within two hours of Rams games and ban the arena from using any part 
of the Anaheim Stadium parking lot during Rams games. The city also would agree 
to pay the Rams 50% of parking proceeds if the new arena's parking lot is used 
by people attending Rams games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the city would agree to pay the Rams' $100,000 attorney fees 
stemming from the team's lawsuit filed in January challenging Anaheim's arena 
environmental report.

DON'T TELL 'WHOLE TRUTH,' BROWN SAYS ON TAPE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE MURDER DEFENDANT TOLD HIS IMPRISONED DAUGHTER THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY 
COULD BE JAILED IN HIS WIFE'S DEATH.

In a secretly recorded conversation replayed for a jury Friday, David Arnold 
Brown sought to convince his imprisoned daughter that his wife was a 
drug-addicted mobster who wanted to "off" him but that the daughter must not 
tell "the whole truth" about her stepmother's killing because the whole family 
would end up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of one person being punished for (the murder)," Brown told his 
daughter, Cinnamon, "we'd all be punished for it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a millionaire computer entrepreneur from Anaheim Hills who is on trial 
for murder, conceded in the conversation that he took part in his daughter's 
1985 plot to kill his wife, but insisted repeatedly that he never encouraged 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want it to happen -- you should remember that," the 38-year-old Brown 
told Cinnamon sternly during an August, 1988, visit to the California Youth 
Authority in Camarillo, where Cinnamon was imprisoned for her stepmother's 
murder. "I told you guys I didn't want any part of it." 
</P>
<P>
With Cinnamon Brown's cooperation, authorities tape-recorded the conversation 
in an attempt to show that David Brown had orchestrated the murder of his wife, 
24-year-old Linda Brown, and then set up Cinnamon to take the fall for it. 
</P>
<P>
Following her 1985 murder conviction, Cinnamon Brown, now 19, remained silent 
for more than three years about what happened on the night of the killing, 
saying she could not remember. But she changed her story and implicated her 
father after authorities disclosed to her that he had collected $835,000 from 
the victim's insurance and then married Patti Bailey, the victim's sister. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, now 22, has since pleaded guilty to murder for her role in Linda 
Brown's shooting death in the family's Garden Grove home. Bailey and David 
Brown now have a daughter. But on the tape, Brown vigorously denies to Cinnamon 
that the child is his or that he and Bailey were romantically involved. 
</P>
<P>
Some five weeks after the tape recording was made, David Brown was arrested and 
charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they believe that the tape offers one of their most damaging 
pieces of evidence against Brown, leaving unchallenged his role in the killing 
of his wife. The tape, portions of which were published in The Times last year, 
was played for the first time publicly Friday at Brown's trial in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Co-defense attorney Richard Schwartzberg, pointing out Brown's denials that he 
wanted his wife dead, said: "This does not hurt David. It supports our belief 
that David was not involved in the killing of Linda Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartzberg said that Brown's knowledge of any plot to kill his wife is not a 
criminal offense. But Brown, in the recorded conversation, clearly thinks 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
In the tape, Cinnamon Brown tells her father that she is confused and tired of 
telling "lies" to CYA parole officials, who had been trying to convince her to 
tell what she knew about the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Her father responds: "You can tell the truth, if you don't tell the whole 
truth. If there was knowledge . . . in advance of what was going to happen, 
then we'll all go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Brown acknowledges that he had talked with Cinnamon 
and Patti Bailey about killing Linda, who he claimed was a drug addict with 
ties to the "Mafia" and the "mob." Linda and her twin brother, Brown tells 
Cinnamon, planned to "off" him and take over his lucrative computer 
data-retrieval business. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors don't believe such a plan ever existed and say the claim was 
Brown's way of getting his daughter to shoot Linda Brown to death on March 19, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
On the tape recording, Brown urges Cinnamon to continue telling authorities 
that she doesn't remember what happened on the night of the murder and avoid 
casting suspicion on himself, Patti Bailey and his parents, who he said had 
been present during part of the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you see any reason for five people's lives to be ruined . . . for all of us 
to go to jail because we knew what was going to happen beforehand?" Brown asks. 
"I can't survive in jail. . . . I would kill myself before I'd let myself die a 
slow and painful death in a cell."

VONS RECALLS TWO BRANDS OF NONFAT MILK AS ABOVE-NORMAL BACTERIA LEVELS FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A malfunctioning cleaning system in a Los Angeles milk production plant 
probably accelerated bacterial growth in a tank of nonfat milk, state officials 
said Friday, which caused about 100 people to fall ill and led to the voluntary 
recall of the milk. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Vons Companies Inc., however, said there was no connection between 
the cleaning system and the spoiled milk. 
</P>
<P>
Vons on Thursday night decided to recall Jerseymaid and Westwood nonfat milk 
dated May 13 and 14 after finding higher than normal levels of bacteria in some 
cartons. The company, which makes both brands, had received telephone calls 
from people who suffered from diarrhea and nausea after drinking the milk. 
</P>
<P>
Cartons of the milk have been pulled from the shelves in all of Vons Cos.' 328 
Southern California stores, which include Vons, Pavilions and Tianguis markets 
from Fresno County to the Mexican border, spokeswoman Vickie Sanders said. 
Customers who have purchased the milk are being asked to return it and will be 
given a refund or a product of comparable worth, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County store managers contacted Friday reported few returns and no 
health problems stemming from a recall of milk produced by Vons-owned 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a lot of activity," said Jack Monette, a Vons store manager in 
San Juan Capistrano. "It hasn't seemed to be much of a problem." 
</P>
<P>
An April 30 breakdown in the cleaning mechanism at the South Los Angeles plant 
where Jerseymaid and Westwood milk is pasteurized and bottled most likely 
caused nonfat milk in a silo to spoil prematurely, officials at the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture's milk and dairy foods control branch said 
Friday. The system was shut down for more than eight hours before it was fixed. 
About 33,000 gallons of nonfat milk in the silo were bottled and distributed to 
stores, although it is unclear how much actually was tainted. 
</P>
<P>
"Our best estimate was (the tank) wasn't cleaned properly," said Richard Tate, 
chief of the branch. "There was obviously a procedural defect, which is 
magnified at a processing plant because it's not just a delivery-route 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
But Sanders said the tank used to store the milk "was never connected or had 
anything to do with the part of the system that had a malfunction." 
</P>
<P>
The company has taken the silo out of service and is conducting additional 
tests to look for any defects, Tate said. He said tests conducted on the milk 
before it was delivered could not have detected abnormal bacteria levels 
immediately because the psychrophilic (cold temperature) bacteria discovered in 
the milk has an incubation period of five to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
Vons recalled the milk Thursday after receiving two telephone calls, one from 
the state's Central Valley and one from the Los Angeles area, each reporting 
two illnesses. Since it announced the recall, it received calls from about 100 
people throughout Southern California who fell ill after drinking the nonfat 
milk, Sanders said. She said none of the people were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Jerseymaid and Westwood brands are sold only in Vons-owned stores. 
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed that not all of their nonfat milk with May 13 and 14 
expiration dates is spoiled, but the company is pulling all of it off the 
shelves as a safety measure. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason for a serious health hazard as far as we can determine," 
Sanders said. "Many people drank the milk with no health effects."

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS WAIT AS WINFIELD FUMES IN LIMBO

Dave Winfield is coming!

<P>
Dave Winfield is coming! 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield isn't coming! 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield isn't coming! 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Mike Port doesn't make more trades. Even when the Angels get their 
man, they don't get their man. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels say Winfield is an Angel. The New York Yankees say Winfield is an 
Angel. But Winfield, who has a say in the matter, says he's catching "a cab for 
limbo," which, to my knowledge, has no major league franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Angels, Yankees and Winfield are embroiled in a numbers game. 
Winfield's claim is that he's a 10-5 man -- 10 years in the big leagues, the 
past five with the same team -- and that gives him veto power over any trade. 
The Yankees counter-claim with seven -- the number of teams Winfield already 
had approved, by contract, as acceptable should he be traded. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are one of the seven. 
</P>
<P>
So what's the deal with the deal? Winfield already gave his OK on Anaheim and 
the Yankees sent him there. What's more, Winfield can't stand playing for 
George Steinbrenner. The only thing worse is not playing for George 
Steinbrenner -- Winfield's latest plight ever since Yankee Manager Bucky Dent 
began platooning him with Claudell Washington, who had been platooning with the 
Angels until Port traded him for Luis Polonia, who wasn't allowed to platoon 
with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? 
</P>
<P>
So is Winfield. That's really all that's at play here. Winfield is headed for a 
team that wants him, but the trade was consummated without his knowledge, so he 
feels he's been wronged. If proper channels had been navigated -- if Winfield 
had been asked first -- this whole messy fallout could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
But when's the last time Steinbrenner went through proper channels? 
</P>
<P>
This is one relationship that couldn't end amicably. How could it? It began 
with Steinbrenner insulting Winfield ("He's no Reggie"), it smoldered when 
Winfield fired back (his biography), and it incinerated when the lawsuits began 
to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it may take binding arbitration to bring it to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Port is not one for loose ends and he'd have waited to announce it, but the 
Yankees couldn't. You deal with Steinbrenner, you deal with the consequences. 
The story that hit the wires seemed to catch the Angels off-guard -- for a 
couple of hours, the trade was Winfield for "a player to be named later" -- and 
the Angel publicity staff was forced to dispatch a quick press release that 
included the name of the other player, Mike Witt. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield for Mike Witt. Three years ago, such a trade would've interrupted 
regular TV programming. But in 1990, both teams are left to wonder what they're 
getting and how much of it is damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield is 38 and has driven in six runs since the end of the 1988 season. 
Back surgery caused him to miss all of 1989 and a .213 batting average has 
caused him to miss much of 1990. After going 0 for 22 in late April, Winfield 
became a part-time player on the sixth-place team in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, who turns 30 in two months, is currently the reverse of that against the 
American League: 0-3. If his Angel career was charted on a graph, it would 
resemble the Crash of '29. Since 1986, Witt's victory totals have taken the 
plunge, from 18 to 16 to 13 to nine to ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Angels made Mark Langston a rich man, Witt became the sixth starter in 
a five-man rotation. He was the odd man out, banished to the bullpen and let 
out only for special occasions, such as the last two innings of Langston's 
first-week no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
With the Yankees, Witt will get the chance to start again. And he's definitely 
going to the Yankees. That much is certain. Even if Winfield stays, Witt will 
be wearing pinstripes within 72 hours and the Angels will have to think up some 
new compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they can get Claudell back. He's still wanted in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe Winfield will start to warm to the idea once he rolls it over in his 
mind a while. He should reconsider his options. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Autry or George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Happy Anaheim Stadium, where .500 teams draw 2.4 million fans, or the Bronx 
Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the outfield or not playing the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Winfield has seen the Angels play this year, so you never know. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement is only beginning. Should Dave stay or should he go? When is 
arbitration scheduled? And if he is indeed an Angel, what happens then? Where 
does he play? 
</P>
<P>
Left field? That aborts the Luis Polonia leadoff experiment awfully fast, 
doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Right field? That either ousts Dante Bichette -- and how can the Angels afford 
to oust a .295 hitter? -- or it moves Bichette to center field, which would 
oust Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Angels afford to do that? Try them. 
</P>
<P>
There may have been better times to trade for Winfield -- 1987 would have been 
nice -- and, yet, in another light, there never has been a better time. In 
context, Winfield is the perfect fit for the Angels, the right man for the 
moment at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Much like the team that wants him, Dave Winfield isn't sure if he's coming or 
going.

<P>
Mike McNary can count on one hand the reasons Servite High School's baseball 
team will miss the playoffs for the first time in his five years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it only takes four fingers -- one for each one-run defeat the Friars 
suffered in their last four Angelus League games. 
</P>
<P>
The latest came Friday against visiting Bishop Amat, 5-4, in a game to decide 
the league's No. 3 entry into the Southern Section 5-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat is 14-8, 6-6 in league play. Servite finished 16-10, 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
Servite, which was ranked as high as third in the Orange County poll, ended its 
season on a five-game losing streak, including a nonleague loss to St. John 
Bosco. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a little while before we figure out what happened," McNary 
said. "It was sort of like getting hit by a sledgehammer." 
</P>
<P>
When McNary took over the Servite program in 1986, the Friars hadn't made the 
playoffs in seven years. But McNary guided Servite to a league championship in 
his first year and added another title in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Servite was on its way to another playoff appearance this season until early 
last week, when the Friars lost an extra-inning game against St. Paul. Since 
then, McNary couldn't find a way to stop the team's skid. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no explanation for it," he said. "Our pitchers were giving up 
one or two walks a game all year. Then in the last five games, they've been 
walking six or seven. And the clutch hits just haven't been coming." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Servite stranded seven runners in scoring position.

<P>
Meanwhile, Servite workhorse Cliff Mierendorf (5-4) wobbled through his 
roughest start of the season. He staked Bishop Amat to a 5-0 lead, giving up a 
two-run homer to Eric White in the first inning and a two-run single to White 
in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars rallied to pull within a run by the sixth behind the hitting of Whit 
Haydon, Neal Yamamoto and Blaine Patriquin, who each had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
George Garcia (4-1) earned the win in relief of White, who was ejected along 
with Servite shortstop Eddie Crippen after a bench-clearing brawl in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating, but the effort was always there," McNary said. "I never had 
to sit the kids down and chew them out for not trying. Now we'll just try to 
put the pieces back together."

SANTA ANA'S ROSS LOSES REGULAR-SEASON FINALE

<P>
Santa Ana High School's final regular-season game under Coach Bill Ross, dean 
of county coaches, was a little out of character. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has announced his retirement after 32 seasons, watched his team 
commit four errors and walk six batters in a 3-1 loss to Villa Park in Century 
League game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park (16-8-1, 9-6 in league play) clinched second place in the league 
despite getting only three hits, but the Spartans capitalized on two errors to 
score unearned runs in the first and fourth innings. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana (12-13, 8-7) managed four hits off winning pitcher Todd Wilson (3-3) 
and will enter the opening round of the Southern Section 4-A playoffs next week 
on the road as the league's No. 3 entry. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana used a makeshift lineup, with all-league shortstop Octavio Medina at 
first base suffering tendinitis in his right shoulder, pitcher Jesse Rosas 
reduced to a designated hitter role with a sore arm and first baseman Billy 
Johnson on the bench with a broken thumb. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the loss and the injuries, Ross said he had plenty to be thankful 
for as he walked off the Santa Ana diamond for what is likely to be the last 
time as coach. His career record is 477-234. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana qualified for postseason play for the 19th time under Ross. Playoff 
pairings will be announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good time the last 32 years," he said. "I was fortunate enough to win 
the big one (the 3-A title in 1982) and we made the playoffs one more time in 
my last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in last place (1-5) at the Easter break, but we turned it around and 
won seven straight before this week. Our only problem was we couldn't beat 
those (Villa Park) guys." 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park won three straight in the series, getting one-run victories in the 
previous two meetings. Dave Ochoa, Villa Park's 16-year coach, said he will 
miss the rivalry when Santa Ana enters the Sunset League next season. 
</P>
<P>
"If you looked at Bill's teams 10 or 15 years ago, and then looked at them 
today, you notice that they seldom changed," Ochoa said. "They were always 
consistently, fundamentally sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they were a good team or a bad team, they seldom made mistakes. Bill 
did a lot for baseball in the county and he'll be missed." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 56, will continue as the school's athletic director and his next move 
will be naming his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"(Assistant) Bob Glassman will take the team this summer, and I'm hoping the 
district will approve Bob for the job," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley 4, El Modena 3 -- Brian Lee and Armondo Cueva had consecutive 
squeeze bunts as Santa Ana Valley scored two runs in the sixth to take a 4-3 
lead at El Modena. Alex Alvarado pitched 1 1/3 innings for the victory and 
Scott Crosby pitched the final two innings for his third save. Crosby had two 
hits and an RBIs and Al Ramos had a RBI double also for Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 4, Canyon 2 -- John Scardino (4-7) pitched a four hitter and had nine 
strikeouts for visiting El Modena (9-15-1, 6-8-1). Brian Palluck had a two-run 
double in the sixth as Foothill took a 4-0 lead. Canyon scored twice in the 
sixth on a throwing error. Chris Pena had two hits for Canyon (12-12-1, 
10-4-1).

TOSHIBA TO TRIPLE ITS IRVINE WORK FORCE IN THE NEXT 2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Toshiba America Information Systems Inc. has accelerated its year-old expansion 
in Orange County because of brisk demand for its products and expects to nearly 
triple its local employment -- to 2,400 people -- by March, 1992, according to 
the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
Kiichi Hataya, president of TAIS, a U.S. subsidiary of Tokyo-based Toshiba 
Corp., said in an interview the company expects to employ 3,000 people 
throughout its U.S. operations by early 1992, up sharply from earlier estimates 
of 2,200 by that date. The unit's current U.S. employment is 1,560 people. 
</P>
<P>
The revised estimate is based on current growth expectations, Hataya said. The 
company currently employs 879 people at its Irvine manufacturing operation, 
which produces laptop computers, business telephones, facsimile machines, 
office copiers and cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
This week the company began making printed circuit boards for its popular 
laptop computer line in a new, $9-million plant within its sprawling 
headquarters complex in the Irvine Spectrum business park. Employment at the 
circuit board plant will grow from 75 to 220 by March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Hataya said the expansion is due to acceptance of Toshiba's products as well as 
the Japanese parent firm's long-term strategy to shift manufacturing of 
products sold in the U.S. market from Japan to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Hataya also said the company plans to manufacture a new lightweight 
"laptop-type engineering workstation," introduced earlier this week by parent 
company Toshiba Corp. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The new machine will hit the Japanese market in July and will probably reach 
the U.S. market early next year, Hataya said. Toshiba will manufacture the 
machine in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-pound computer -- a result of a venture between Toshiba and Sun 
Microsystems Inc. in Mountain View -- is the first laptop model to use a 32-bit 
Sparc microprocessor based on Sun's reduced instruction set computing (RISC) 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
RISC chips reduce the number of operating instructions a processor needs to 
crunch data, making it faster than conventional processors. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lempesis, a computer analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose market research 
firm, said the laptop workstation focuses on a relatively narrow segment of the 
laptop market. He estimated Toshiba has a 13.7% share of the $4.1-billion U.S. 
laptop computer market, which is expected to soar to $22.8 billion by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba opened its information systems unit in 1981. Spurred by the threat of a 
ban on Toshiba imports as a result of trade violations in 1987, as well as the 
corporation's strategy to establish manufacturing operations on all major 
continents, the company has shifted more production to the United States in the 
past several years. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next two years, Hataya said, U.S. firms will supply up to 60% of the 
parts for printed circuit boards for Toshiba laptop, compared to about 5% now. 
The subsidiary reported sales of about $900 million for its fiscal year ended 
March 31.

BOARD VIEWS PLAN TO EXPAND ART INSTITUTE IN LAGUNA CANYON; 
</P>

ENVIRONMENT: MEMBERS' REACTIONS WERE REPORTEDLY POSITIVE, THOUGH THE 
$5.6-MILLION PROJECT HAD EARLIER RAISED CONCERNS AMONG ANTI-DEVELOPMENT 
ACTIVISTS.

<P>
Details of a controversial plan to expand the Art Institute of Southern 
California in rustic Laguna Canyon met with applause from institute board 
members when unveiled at a private dinner Thursday night. But board President 
Nancy Snyder would not comment on more specific reaction by the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
All questions about the plan were referred to institute President William 
Otton, who was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports of the $5.6-million expansion and endowment plan had stirred 
concern and some opposition from environmental activists, for whom the coastal 
canyon long has been a focus of anti-development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder repeated that the plan has not yet been approved by the school's 
trustees or submitted to the city of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not beginning, or even starting to begin, our capital campaign," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The board will discuss the plan Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Otton said earlier in the week that while he knows "there will be a certain 
amount of resistance to any expansion" in the canyon, he is confident the board 
will endorse the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The school is the only art institute in Orange County that awards the bachelor 
of fine arts degree. Planning for the expansion started last summer after 
completion of a five-year plan in which enrollment was projected to grow from 
105 "full-time equivalent" students to about 300 in the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
In related action, school officials are considering a recommendation that the 
college change its name for the fourth time. Founded in 1961 as the Laguna 
Beach School of Art, the school was renamed the Laguna College of Art in 
January, 1986, and, the following June, the Art Institute of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The current name seems "confusing for a lot of people in the community," Otton 
said. "It doesn't include the word college; nor does it state where (the school 
is) located. The college recognizes that it is not known in its own community 
for the services it offers."

Julie knew she needed help when she realized one morning that she was letting 
her 5-year-old take care of her 1- and 3-year-old daughters all day -- while 
she drank. 
</P>
<P>
"Every morning I would put out a bowl of food for the kids and let them take 
care of themselves," says Julie, who requested that only her first name be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden it hit me, and I ran out to call my social worker to ask her 
to find a home for my kids," says Julie, 34, a single mother on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Julie, who lived in a two-bedroom house in Ventura, says she would buy two 
fifths of whiskey, a case of beer and some wine, which she hoped would last a 
week. Unemployed, lonely and isolated, Julie says she struggled to overcome her 
alcoholism but became overwhelmed by her disease and her responsibilities.

Julie's predicament is not uncommon, says Cathy Anacker, executive director of 
the California Women's Commission on Alcohol and Drug Dependencies in Van Nuys. 
According to the Los Angeles County Offices of Alcohol Programs, 18% of 
American women either have alcohol-related problems or are at high risk for 
such problems. "Women have a tough time because they are typically the ones who 
are responsible for the children," Anacker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Recovering is a full-time effort, and then to add the responsibilities of 
care-giving on top of that -- it's incredibly difficult." 
</P>
<P>
A few organizations are available to help women specifically with alcohol and 
drug dependencies and to offer psychological support and foster care for their 
children. These include Hope for Kids, Rainbow Recovery Centers and Via Avanta. 
</P>
<P>
In Julie's case, her social worker told her about Hope for Kids, an 
Oxnard-based program that recruits foster families to care for children while 
their mothers are recovering. Through Hope for Kids, two of Julie's children 
were placed in one home and the third in another, freeing her to enroll in a 
30-day detoxification program in Oxnard. After detoxification, Julie went to 
Rainbow Recovery Centers, a nonprofit Ventura County-based program for women 
and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Recovery Centers have two facilities for women -- one in Simi Valley, 
the other in Oxnard -- that provide three to six months of live-in treatment 
for 250 clients a year who are addicted to alcohol and sometimes drugs as well, 
said Kathleen McQuillan, the centers' executive director. In addition to the 
women's facility, Rainbow Recovery Centers have a youth facility in Ventura 
that accommodates six 13- to 17-year-olds and a counseling and educational 
facility in Oxnard for all ages. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to make women aware that they do have a choice," McQuillan said. "They 
don't have to be a punching bag, work at a fast-food facility or be on 
welfare." Since Rainbow Recovery Centers will help with their other 
responsibilities, she points out, "all they have to do is abstain from alcohol 
and drugs and they can change their lives." 
</P>
<P>
To be accepted into Rainbow Recovery Centers -- and there are waiting lists at 
all three residential facilities -- a woman has to make a three-month 
commitment to the program, be motivated to change and have a positive attitude, 
McQuillan said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, funded by Ventura County, the United Way and by fees the 
participants pay once they begin to work, is designed to encourage the clients 
to help in one another's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"They assign the chores, like who does the wash, and they call each other on 
their behavior," said McQuillan, who added that learning how to interact with 
one another and to rely on others is an important part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Recovery Centers also provide group sessions and involve each client in 
developing a personal plan to break addictions. 
</P>
<P>
Julie, who is still at Rainbow Recovery Centers, sounds determined when she 
says she is committed to finding a job, getting off welfare, finding a place to 
live and getting her children back. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of guilt, but a part of me knows that I'm doing the best I can," 
she said. "I love my kids, and I'd rather have them safe with foster parents 
than here with me passed out. I've learned I have to take care of myself first. 
And then I can take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Recovery Centers were founded in 1981 with financial support from the 
California Women's Commission on Alcohol and Drug Dependencies. Developing such 
programs, Anacker said, is the main work of the individual chapters of the 
600-member commission. 
</P>
<P>
The private, nonprofit group, designated a commission in 1974 by the state, now 
has an annual $200,000 budget, Anacker said. The money comes from the state 
Department of Alcoholism Programs, the Los Angeles County Offices of Alcohol 
Programs and individual memberships. 
</P>
<P>
The goals of the commission, Anacker said, are: 
</P>
<P>
* To advocate treatment rather than punishment of drug-addicted mothers. 
</P>
<P>
* To support services that encourage women to become independent. 
</P>
<P>
* To educate the community through classes at local colleges (including Cal 
State Northridge), recovery houses and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Anacker speaks from personal experience. She was addicted to drugs and alcohol 
15 years ago and her children, 7 and 14, were born while she was recovering. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Bixler was also an addict. Now the 28-year-old single mother of three is 
working part time as a counselor at Via Avanta in Pacoima, a long-term 
residential recovery program for addicted women and their children. But three 
years ago she was addicted to cocaine, taking three to four grams a day until 
the very day she delivered her son, Shawn, now 2. 
</P>
<P>
"When my son was born, he was immediately taken by Children's Protective 
Services because he had drugs in his system from me," Bixler said. "I was so 
screwed up it didn't faze me." 
</P>
<P>
Bixler didn't see her baby again for six months. Her 8- and 5-year-old children 
were placed in different foster care homes and Bixler was on waiting lists for 
seven different recovery programs. 
</P>
<P>
A counselor told her about Via Avanta, which is a rough equivalent of "the way 
forward" in Latin. She applied and she got right in. She stayed in the program 
for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part was wondering if this was going to work for me, and not being 
with my kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the program only allows mothers to bring one child under age 8 with 
them, Cathy had to pick between her three. She chose baby Shawn, but because he 
was born with an immune-deficiency problem that makes him susceptible to 
infections, she initially had trouble persuading the staff to allow him in. 
Eventually she succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Via Avanta, said its program director, Marcellus Robinson, opened in 1971 in 
Venice and moved to Pacoima 11 years ago. Part of the Didi Hirsch Community 
Mental Health Center in Culver City, the program offers a nine- to 18-month 
program with a capacity of 48 women and 20 to 25 children. 
</P>
<P>
The residential program, Robinson said, has one staff member for every seven 
clients and is designed to deal with needs ranging from the women's and 
children's medical problems to parenting education, counseling, and job-hunting 
and money-management skills. The center also has a weekly group to help program 
graduates readjust to the larger world. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of women who need this," Robinson said. "There are not but two 
or three recovery programs where the women can go after in Los Angeles that 
will accept women and children. And without the program, the child has to go 
into the protective services system. Without the program, women have to go into 
recovery without their children." 
</P>
<P>
Now Bixler and her children have an apartment in Van Nuys. After completing the 
program at Via Avanta, she was hired to work 2 1/2 days a week as a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day I'm working there, I see my life played over and over again in the 
lives of the residents there. And now I'm making it. I'm responsible now. And 
it's not all that hard. I wouldn't change my life right now for anything," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another recovered addict, Ann, 36, says she looks back on the last 10 years she 
has been in treatment and the 14 years she was addicted and wishes she hadn't 
wasted all that valuable time. 
</P>
<P>
"My son is a teen-ager today and we finally have the best relationship, the 
best we've ever had. And now we only have a few short years together before 
he'll leave home," said Ann, who requested that only her first name be used. 
</P>
<P>
Ann started using alcohol when she was 12 or 13 "as a fluke," she said. "It was 
there, so we thought we'd use it." Throughout her adolescence she says she also 
tried marijuana, LSD, amphetamines, barbiturates and heroin. She graduated from 
high school -- barely, she said -- and started working in a series of office 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
And then she tried heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of like it just happened," said Ann, who lives in Ventura. "My 
boyfriend had gone to jail for selling heroin. I was depressed about that and 
my friends just offered me a fix." She said that was when she began to have 
trouble functioning in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"All along there was something down inside me that told me I was doomed from 
the start. A voice kept telling me I didn't have it, I didn't know how to do 
life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ann said her life really started to fall apart when her son was born. 
Throughout the pregnancy, she says, she was using heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the hospital loaded. I don't remember a thing." 
</P>
<P>
She said she nursed her newborn son and continued to use heroin, so the two 
were addicted together. 
</P>
<P>
"I had so much hate and anger toward my baby. He was interfering with my using. 
There was violence; there was abuse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in an effort to get off the streets, Ann decided to try a residential 
program in Ventura that was based on the 12-step Narcotics Anonymous program. 
Her parents took her son. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few years after she left the residential program, she said, she 
had difficulty assuming responsibilities, including caring for her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in denial, guilt and rage," she said, "often flying off in temper 
tantrums. I was horrible." But gradually she straightened out her life. 
</P>
<P>
She is now studying business in college and working part time in an office. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea I was going to stay clean. But it turned out to be one addict 
helping another," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned I had a chance. I had lost my choices and in the program I got them 
back. The obsession was lifted, and I gradually came out of the fog. That's 
where the little bit of hope came in. But turning the hope into something real 
took years."

WEEKEND RETREAT: CPR FOR MARRIAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forty married couples with problems checked into an Irvine hotel one Friday 
night. Some were combatants, just steps from divorce. Others thought their 
marriages were good, but they could be better. Forty-four hours later, every 
relationship had changed and the couples were on an emotional "high," they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I love him again," said Kathy Tiesi, 31. "I came here hating him. Our 11-year 
marriage was just about over. We were at the bottom of the pit. There was so 
much hurt and pain that we couldn't even talk to each other anymore. There were 
such walls that I couldn't feel anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"I had never before cried in front of my wife," said her husband Mike, 40. "But 
I couldn't stop crying all weekend." 
</P>
<P>
In a county where more than 13,000 couples filed for divorce last year, these 
people beat the odds. 
</P>
<P>
They did it by participating in Christian Marriage Communication (CMC), and by 
becoming among 10 million people who have graduated from a version of "Marriage 
Encounter," a technique to enhance communication among couples. 
</P>
<P>
The program was developed by a Spanish Catholic priest in 1962 and brought to 
the United States four years later. It was adopted by more than a dozen other 
religious "expressions," most of which operate under the umbrella of 
Catholic-run Worldwide Marriage Encounter, based nationally in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
CMC, a nondenominational group, is not under the auspices of Worldwide Marriage 
Encounter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an experience, a process, a way of relating to (your spouse) which you'll 
enter into and work out," said Gail Wolfe, 51, an escrow officer who with her 
husband handles CMC registration and occasionally leads weekends. "So it's not 
a relaxing vacation, but a weekend of work requiring concentration and effort . 
. . a crash course in husband-wife communications that can be used for the rest 
of your lives." 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 10 groups in Orange County that offer the program. Some 
groups have waiting lists, while others have branched off to offer similar 
programs for children, teen-agers and engaged couples. 
</P>
<P>
Most popularly known as Marriage Encounter with its red and yellow heart design 
bumper stickers, the weekend goes under various names depending on which group 
is sponsoring it. In Orange County, churches that offer it include Catholic, 
Baptist, Episcopal, Jewish, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Seventh-day 
Adventist and United Church of Christ. Affiliation with the presenting group's 
faith or any other religion is not a requirement to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not affiliated with any church," says Wolfe, who completed her weekend 
in 1977, then became active in CMC. "We started simply as a group of concerned 
couples in Orange County. We do have a Christian commitment and we say that, 
but we also say 'take whatever you want out of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"We use the same outline (as Marriage Encounter), but we took out the dogma," 
said Wolfe. CMC removed the word encounter from its literature. The weekend is 
a private experience with no group sharing. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said CMC workshops have helped more than 900 couples in the last decade. 
They are offered four weekends a year. It cost CMC about $150 per couple for 
two days' food and lodging. Couples make an anonymous donation at the end of 
the weekend, but no one has been turned away for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in it for money," said Wolfe. "We've had one couple leave three 
pennies because that's all they had. Others are affluent and leave enough to 
pay for four couples." 
</P>
<P>
On this CMC weekend, participants check into the Irvine Host Hotel Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Four "presenting couples" lead the agenda and share "deeply out of their own 
lives, sometimes very painful ordeals" and describe how they resolved them, 
Wolfe said. Participating couples are then taught special communication tools 
called "dialoguing," a process of expressing their feelings without fear of 
reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
After being told that every marriage goes through three cycles -- romance, 
disillusionment and true joy -- couples learn to share their feelings without 
fear of being faulted, attacked or ridiculed. This creates intimacy between the 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
Communication exercises are practiced in the privacy of the couples' rooms. All 
meals are served on the premises with cooking and cleanup provided to eliminate 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
After the seminar, presenters advise couples to schedule 30 minutes a day to 
continue to strengthen communication skills. Many couples socialize with other 
"encountered" couples at gatherings that emphasize the family. 
</P>
<P>
"In the world today, the family is not the center," said Jim Wolfe, 46, Gail's 
husband of 20 years. "Everyone is going their own ways. Commitment means you 
are going to stick to it, and that comes with communication. You are having two 
lives that were separated and mending them together to work as one." 
</P>
<P>
Willie and Wanda Phillips of Westminster have been married three years. Wanda, 
31, cares for their three small children while Willie works long hours at the 
mortgage company he owns in Inglewood. Both said their marriage had been fairly 
"decent." But both said it wasn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We were married singles," said Willie, referring to a lifestyle where each 
person goes (his) own way. "I wanted to put a priority on my marriage but I 
never found the time, it never gets done." 
</P>
<P>
"He'd get home at 8, just about the time I was very irritated," said his wife. 
"We weren't so much fighting -- we just weren't talking and understanding each 
other's feelings. In the morning, we'd just roll off a couple of sentences and 
it's time to get the kids off to school." 
</P>
<P>
After seeing some friends' marriages improve as a result of CMC, they decided 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a changed person," said Wanda. "(The weekend) made me remember why 
I married this man and how much I really do love him. It's like being on a high 
exactly. I've learned a new tool to use, something I can always refer back to." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional marriage counseling, CMC is not run by professional 
therapists but by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are lay people," said Wolfe. "We say the weekend is not for distressed 
marriages because we are not professional counselors and we don't want them to 
have expectations. But many who come are in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said she has seen couples come in hardly speaking to each other, with 
divorce papers ready to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
"As the weekend progresses, you see them getting closer to each other," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiesis of Newbury Park were ready to separate when they attended this CMC 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the worst couple here," said Kathy. "Everybody else looked like they 
liked each other. For us, it was just a matter of who was going to walk out 
first." 
</P>
<P>
"I had always thought I was good at communicating. But I never could've been 
able to tell her the things I told her if it hadn't been for this weekend," 
said her husband, Mike, a purchasing manager. "I feel like I have a future with 
her now."

TAPED BOOKS ENTER LITERARY FAST LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a veteran magazine representative selling advertising, William Dotts of 
Corona del Mar is on the road at least six hours a day, driving to San Diego, 
Los Angeles and, sometimes, even as far as Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Dotts, 57, views all that driving as a necessary evil, strictly "a means of 
doing business." 
</P>
<P>
And, as Dotts sees it, "it's a stupid waste of time listening to that marvelous 
thing they call radio. You don't want to listen to mindless music or just the 
same old news over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
Dotts doesn't listen to his car radio much anymore -- hasn't, in fact, for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead he pops an audio book into his tape deck. 
</P>
<P>
And, in an instant, he is transported into the mysterious world of John D. 
MacDonald's Travis McGee or he is reliving the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor 
in Gordon W. Prange's "At Dawn We Slept." 
</P>
<P>
Driving, Dotts says, has never been so pleasurable since he started listening 
to books. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to improve your mind and use your time in that car to your 
advantage," said Dotts, who listens to one or two books a week and just 
finished biographies of Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
With a good book along for the ride, he said, "you really don't pay attention 
to the commute and it keeps you from getting frustrated, shall we say, because 
of a traffic jam." 
</P>
<P>
Dotts is not alone in the literary fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
There's Betty Sutton of Laguna Beach, who listens to a half dozen books a 
month: "I love to read, I don't have much time and I'm in the car a lot." 
</P>
<P>
And there's attorney Sallie Reynolds of Newport Beach, who not only listens to 
books when she's driving, "but when I do the dishes and garden or make the bed. 
I just listen to them constantly." 
</P>
<P>
The well-read trio are all customers of Books on Tape, a Costa Mesa company 
that produces and rents out full-length cassette recordings of bestsellers, 
classics, self-help, history and business books. 
</P>
<P>
Books on Tape is one of the leaders in the burgeoning audio publishing 
industry, which is cashing in on the popularity of Sony Walkmans and cassette 
tape players coupled with America's freeway bound, 
too-little-time-too-much-to-do lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that audio books have revolutionized the way many Americans read. 
</P>
<P>
R.R. Bowker's "On Cassette," the standard reference in audio book publishing, 
lists 30,000 titles from 600 producers. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the titles are abridgements for sale in retail outlets, many 
featuring celebrities such as Kirk Douglas reading his autobiography, "The 
Ragman's Son" (Simon &amp; Schuster Audio), or Elliot Gould reprising his movie 
role as detective Philip Marlowe in Raymond Chandler's "The Long Goodbye" 
(Dove). 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster has even released a three-hour recorded version of Richard 
M. Nixon's new memoir, "In the Arena," in which listeners can hear the former 
President himself reading his own words. Ronald Reagan did likewise for 
"Speaking My Mind: Selected Speeches With Personal Reflections," released by 
Simon &amp; Schuster in December. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, bookstores are devoting more shelf space to the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very popular," said Fred Schreier, manager of Scribner Book Store in 
Costa Mesa, which is expanding its already extensive selection of audio books. 
</P>
<P>
The number of audio books, according to Schreier, "increases every year, so 
just about every book now has an audio tape." 
</P>
<P>
The Random House catalogue is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
The New York publishing house began its audio book line five years ago by 
offering 12 titles. Today it offers more than 250 different titles, with 50 to 
60 new ones added to the list each year. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started, the spoken-word audio industry was in its infancy," 
said Leslie Nadell, director of publicity and promotion for Random House Audio 
Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Random House and other publishers increasingly have been releasing cassette 
recordings of new books at the same time as the print editions. By doing so, 
Nadel said, "it gives us the added pop of the publicity. Because the audio 
industry is young, we have to piggyback on that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of the times is that five years ago audio publishers were 
complaining that the medium was so new that reviewers virtually ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as recently as three years ago Nadel knew of only eight reviewers who 
reviewed audio books occasionally. She now estimates that there are several 
hundred reviewers covering audio books on a semi-regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
If the industry was in its infancy when Random House started its audio line, it 
was virtually embryonic when Duvall Hecht started Books on Tape in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The formation of the nation's first audio book rental service was, as Hecht 
says, a case of necessity being the mother of invention. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Hecht was living in Newport Beach and commuting to downtown Los 
Angeles where he worked as marketing manager for a brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I became frantic with the commute," Hecht said. "It's such a terribly numbing 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Burned out on "bad music and worse news," Hecht wrote to everybody he could 
think of -- libraries, publishers, recording companies -- to find out what they 
might have that he could listen to during his commute. 
</P>
<P>
He discovered there were motivational tapes, sales tapes, meditation tapes, 
language tapes, how-to tapes and poetry tapes -- but "at $10 a shot for 60 
minutes -- you've got to get one tape going up and one to come back -- it just 
isn't practical." 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Hecht: "I thought there should be some place that provided a steady 
diet of good quality books that you could access at reasonable cost." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking that "there's got to be a lot of people like me who are bummed out" by 
their commutes, Hecht and his now ex-wife, Sigrid, acquired the rights to four 
books and began renting the unabridged taped books by mail out of their home. 
</P>
<P>
Books on Tape now operates out of a 15,000-square-foot former sail loft in 
Costa Mesa, boasts 75,000 customers nationwide and a catalogue of more than 
2,500 titles. Between 200 and 250 new titles are added each year. 
</P>
<P>
A typical 350-page book equals about 12 hours of tape and rents for $15.50 to 
$17.50, plus postage, for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Hecht concedes that his service isn't inexpensive. "But it's reasonable 
compared to what you spend for abridgements, which are $15 for two hours. A 
commuter wants to fill his hours, so with us you spend $15 and you get 10 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
Because they began their business on a shoestring -- $4,000 from the sale of 
Hecht's 1965 Porsche -- the Hechts were able to offer authors only $100 in 
advance royalties, plus 10% of all rental income, for the audio rights to a 
book. 
</P>
<P>
"In those early days we had one standard offer: Take it or leave it," Hecht 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most took it. 
</P>
<P>
"I always acknowledge how the publishers helped us get started because $100 
isn't an economic decision. It's a decision that says, 'Well, we're going to 
help these guys and we're going to see what they can do,' " said Hecht, who 
still marvels at the fact that Books on Tape paid Robert Ludlum $1,100 for the 
audio rights to 11 of the best-selling author's books. 
</P>
<P>
Books on Tape can now afford to pay up to a $10,000 advance royalty for 
best-selling authors such as Tom Clancy, but the company usually pays between 
$500 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the expense and difficulty in hiring name actors and actresses who 
have the time required to do the lengthy unabridged readings, Books on Tape has 
always used unknown actors and actresses as readers. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Michael Prichard, business manager at the Pasadena Playhouse, has been a 
reader for Books on Tapes since 1976, recording up to three books a month. It 
takes him about 18 hours to record a six-hour book, the equivalent of 300 
pages. But he will read, at most, only 2 1/2 hours a day. "I find 2 1/2 hours 
of concentrated reading can exhaust you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prichard said that doing a book reading is a lot different from acting on 
stage. Readers, he said, must keep in mind that they're reading to one person, 
not an audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to tell it the way the author would like it told or would tell it 
himself if he had a chance," Prichard said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a relatively unknown actor such as Prichard can develop his own 
coterie of fans -- over the years he has taped readings of 150 books -- 
celebrity readers dominate the abridgements. 
</P>
<P>
And there's no denying that the celebrity factor adds significantly to the 
tapes' appeal. 
</P>
<P>
After all, who wouldn't like to hear Charlton Heston read Hemingway's "The Old 
Man and the Sea" or the inimitable Shelley Winters talking about her love 
affairs in "Shelley II: The Middle of My Century." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's what makes it fun," said Seth Gershel, vice president and 
director of sales for Simon &amp; Schuster Audio. "It's kind of nice to sit 
back and hear a voice that you're familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity or not, the right match of reader and material is critical. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Trentman, founder of Recorded Books, a Maryland audio book rental 
company, said: "A reader can really have a dramatic effect on a book. They can 
take a mediocre novel and make it much better than it is, and take a good novel 
and lessen the enjoyment of it." 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning, audio books have been criticized for further eroding the 
nation's reading habit. 
</P>
<P>
Hecht and others in the field maintain that isn't so. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who subscribe are all highly literate people, all book people," 
Hecht said. "The problem, as they see it, is they don't have enough time to 
read with their eyes. This is just another way of reading." 
</P>
<P>
Random House's Nadell agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"By far, the majority of our product is sold in bookstores and anyone who walks 
into a bookstore is first and foremost a reader," she said. "It's similar to 
the movie industry: Just because you rent a videocassette at home does not mean 
you don't go to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
Audio abridgments, in particular, have come under attack by critics who decry 
them as "Kentucky Fried literature." Despite the appeal of hearing a familiar 
celebrity voice, there's no question that abridgment listeners receive only a 
sampling of an author's work -- a literary hors d'oeuvre rather than a 
full-course meal. 
</P>
<P>
Take Tom Wolfe's 659-page "Bonfire of the Vanities," for example. The 
unabridged Books on Tape version read by Michael Prichard runs 27 hours; Random 
House's abridgement read by actor John Lithgow runs only 180 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Playboy book critic Digby Diehl recently wrote, in comparing the two 
versions: "I can assure you that by going the condensed route, you will be 
missing eight-ninths of the fun." 
</P>
<P>
As Hecht sees it, there's room for everything. 
</P>
<P>
"For some people, what they want -- what they've got time for, what suits their 
concentration -- is to have a quick fix on an abridgement," he said. "And we 
have folks who want to dig deeper -- they want to get the whole thing -- and 
that's the market we serve." 
</P>
<P>
Hecht views audio books as simply a way to fill down time. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person is sitting down around the home, I think he wants to read a book," 
Hecht said. "But if he's out gardening he'll want to have a headset on. And 
then there's those times when they're in their cars. The commuters are the guys 
who are desperate for something to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Hecht predicted that commuters would be the company's 
biggest customers and he was right: 90% of Books on Tape subscribers listen to 
them while driving. 
</P>
<P>
As producers of full-length taped books, both Hecht and Trentman concede that 
they are reaching a limited market, however. 
</P>
<P>
Trentman said Recorded Books has 20 employees, all of whom have the opportunity 
to listen to all the books they want for free. And even though some of them 
drive 40 minutes to work, he said, "only a couple of them listen to books." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, he said, is "you've got to be a reader to enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, like their printed-page counterparts, audio book customers sometimes 
get so caught up in a book they just can't turn off. 
</P>
<P>
Books on Tape regulars Ron and Joyce Hanson of Laguna Beach recall the time 
they were listening to John le Carre's "The Russia House" while driving to 
their ranch in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't finished with the book when they arrived at the ranch and so, 
Hanson said, "we sat in the garage 45 minutes to hear the end of it."

A QUIZ TO TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURES OF LUMBER; 
</P>
<P>
WOODWORKING: WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF WOOD, IT'S 
EASY TO MAKE MISTAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A.J. HAND, A.J. Hand is a writer with the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've been working wood nearly all my life, but it took me more than 20 years to 
really understand the nature of the material -- its strengths, its weaknesses, 
how it breathes and moves. As a result, I made mistakes. Guitars I made in the 
summer during college cracked when winter came. Glue joints fell apart. Miters 
that fit perfectly at first slowly opened up and looked several degrees off. 
</P>
<P>
If things like this happen to you, maybe you don't know enough about your 
medium. Here's a little quiz to check your knowledge. Warning: Questions may 
have more than one right answer. 
</P>
<P>
1. You are gluing up the three main boards that make up the pine table top 
shown in the sketch. Which glue will produce the strongest joints? 
</P>
<P>
A. Epoxy. 
</P>
<P>
B. Ordinary white glue such as Elmer's. 
</P>
<P>
C. It doesn't really matter. 
</P>
<P>
2. The reinforcing cleat glued with a tongue-and-groove joint across the end of 
the table-top shown in the sketch will: 
</P>
<P>
A. Cover unattractive end grain. 
</P>
<P>
B. Help prevent the table from warping. 
</P>
<P>
C. Cause the ends of the table to crack. 
</P>
<P>
3. You are planking a deck with pressure-treated lumber. To avoid any problems 
with warping and shrinkage, you should: 
</P>
<P>
A. Store the lumber in the shade and nail it down as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
B. Stack the lumber in a pile with sticks laid crosswise between each layer to 
allow air circulation. 
</P>
<P>
C. Mist the lumber lightly with your garden hose on a daily basis until you are 
ready to nail it down. 
</P>
<P>
4. Most of your woodworking involves soft woods, plywood and particleboard. The 
best blade for your power saw is: 
</P>
<P>
A. A fine-toothed steel plywood blade. 
</P>
<P>
B. A carbide-toothed combination blade. 
</P>
<P>
C. A carbide-toothed rip blade. 
</P>
<P>
5. There is no need to wear a dust mask when cutting, sanding or machining wood 
because it is a safe, all-natural material. 
</P>
<P>
A. True. 
</P>
<P>
B. False. 
</P>
<P>
Answers: 
</P>
<P>
1. C is the correct answer. It doesn't really matter which glue you use here 
because both epoxy and white glue will produce joints stronger than the wood 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
2. A, B and C are all correct. This type of cleat is often added to table tops 
to hide end grain and reduce warping. Unfortunately, it also causes cracking. 
The reason? Wood expands and contracts a great deal across the grain, but 
hardly at all along its grain. When winter comes and humidity in your home 
drops, the table will dry out and start to shrink across the grain. But the 
cleat tries to fight the shrinkage. Eventually the strain becomes too great and 
the table-top cracks. You can prevent this by eliminating the cleat altogether, 
or attaching it so the table-top is free to move. One way to do this is to use 
screws driven through slots or oversized holes in the cleat. You can then cover 
over these screws with wood plugs. 
</P>
<P>
3. B is the correct answer. Pressure-treated lumber normally comes fresh from 
treatment and packed with moisture. If you nail it down that way, it will 
shrink substantially and the spacing between boards can increase a quarter-inch 
or more. Letting the lumber dry out for a few weeks in neatly stickered stacks 
gives it a chance to shrink down close to the size it will attain when it 
reaches equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can install the wood wet and try to compensate for the 
inevitable shrinkage to come by spacing your planks closer than you want them 
to end up, but the result may be uneven. And if you cut any miters (maybe for a 
herringbone planking pattern), you'll find they open up at the heels in a few 
months and look very crudely cut. 
</P>
<P>
4. B, a carbide combination blade is your best bet. It will make good quality 
cuts in all materials, and its carbide teeth will hold up to the abrasive 
nature of particleboard. The all-steel plywood blade will dull quickly on 
particleboard and won't perform well when ripping pine. The carbide rip blade 
will hold up well but will cause horrendous chipping and tearing in the plywood 
and particleboard and while crosscutting the pine. 
</P>
<P>
5. B, false is the correct answer. While the dust from most domestic woods is 
fairly benign, many tropical hardwoods contain allergens and even toxins that 
may cause allergic reactions and even illness. And, of course, you should 
always wear a dust mask when working with pressure-treated lumber. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring 
</P>
<P>
There are seven possible right answers in all. Count up your correct responses 
and rate your knowledge of wood as follows: 
</P>
<P>
All seven right: Solid as a mighty oak. 
</P>
<P>
Five to six right: Strong as an oak sapling. 
</P>
<P>
Three or four right: Would you believe an oak seedling? 
</P>
<P>
Two or less: Nuts! You're still in the acorn stage.

TIPS FOR REPAIRING AND REVITALIZING WOOD FURNITURE; 
</P>
<P>
DAMAGE: A VARIETY OF TREATMENTS, FROM BEESWAX TO A BLOW-DRYER, CAN BE USED TO 
FIX SCRATCHES AND DENTS AROUND THE HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Don't let minor damage diminish furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Follow these tips from Better Homes and Gardens magazine on repairing and 
revitalizing varnish, lacquer and shellac finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Small, shallow scratches in most wood finishes can easily be removed by rubbing 
beeswax across the damage. When there are a lot of small scratches, buff them 
out with pumice and rottenstone and then polish with a coat of paste wax. 
</P>
<P>
For any smaller scratches that have nicked the wood, apply a colored furniture 
polish and scratch-hiding polish to conceal the raw wood. Special soft-tip 
markers or wax filler sticks also will work. 
</P>
<P>
Rings left by glasses and other water spots can be removed by wiping a pad 
soaked in denatured alcohol over the area. Lift the pad up at the end of each 
stroke. If that fails, rub the spot with pumice and rottenstone. 
</P>
<P>
Small dents that haven't damaged the finish or scratched the wood can often be 
brought back to flush by ironing over the dent with a moist cloth and an iron 
set on warm. Also try moistening the area and then heating it with a 
blow-dryer. 
</P>
<P>
If the scratch has gouged deeply, stain the exposed wood to match. Use a 
thinned stain or spot-finishing stain; build up to desired color. Fill the 
crevice with spot-finishing lacquer. Sand with 600-grit sandpaper and polish 
with pumice and rottenstone. 
</P>
<P>
When edges and corners wear down, restore their color and shine by applying a 
thinned stain or spot-finishing stain. Build up thin coats to achieve the 
desired color. Let dry and dab on several thin coats of the original finish. 
Buff to desired gloss with fine steel wool or pumice and rottenstone. 
</P>
<P>
Burns or large gouges require a burn-in stick and a special knife. First, heat 
the burn-in knife and slice off a thin slab of the stick. Melt the slab and 
press it into the gouge. When it has dried, smooth with sandpaper. 
</P>
<P>
When filling or restaining is necessary, also match the grain patterns with the 
undamaged wood. To do this, apply several thin coats of stain until the desired 
background color is reached. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with a small, pointed-tip brush, paint in the lines of grain, using a 
small batch of dark-colored stain. Carefully merge the new patterns that were 
painted in with the original grain. 
</P>
<P>
Often all a dull finish needs is cleaning. To cut through old wax and grime, 
wipe with benzine or naphtha, or use a commercial finish restorer. These 
products can be found in a woodworking or hardware store.

CAREFUL PLANNING IS THE KEY TO AN EASY-MAINTENANCE FLOWER GARDEN; 
</P>
<P>
GARDENING: PREPARING SPACE, SOIL AND WATERING SYSTEMS BEFORE PLANTING WILL MAKE 
UPKEEP MUCH SIMPLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI CARDARELLA, Toni Cardarella is a writer for United Press International. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to plant a flower garden but think you're too busy to take care of 
one, then an easy-maintenance plan may be your pot of soil. 
</P>
<P>
Easy-maintenance gardens are based on well-defined spaces and simple, effective 
designs. They are planned from the very beginning with easy maintenance in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Once you decide on a design that makes good use of the garden space, you can 
begin to consider what you will plant. It does involve some hard work, but 
advance preparation is important: preparing the soil for ground covers, making 
use of edgings, installing various watering systems, mulching and planting 
trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
Plants should be chosen not only for their appropriate size but for their 
suitability to your climate, soil conditions and the level of attention you are 
willing to give. Also, the plants should be those that attract you. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how little care a plant needs, if you don't like it, you won't enjoy 
having it in your garden," writes A. Cort Sinnes in "Easy Maintenance 
Gardening" (Ortho Books, $6.95). 
</P>
<P>
What you choose depends on where you live, how you want your garden to look, 
what types of plants you want and how you want to spend your maintenance time. 
</P>
<P>
Selection guides are available to help determine your initial choices, but you 
might want to double-check your selections with nursery personnel, agricultural 
extensions, garden clubs, gardening neighbors or friends. 
</P>
<P>
Sinnes recommends new varieties of old favorites because plant breeders are 
constantly working to develop new varieties that are more resistant to pests 
and diseases and are more compact than their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the climate where you live, there are many choices of flowers 
available. But Peter Loewer, author of "A Year of Flowers" (Rodale Press, 
$21.95) believes annuals are ideal for the easy-maintenance garden. 
</P>
<P>
Annuals germinate, bloom, set seed and die in one year, while perennials bloom 
year after year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of annuals really great for beds and borders across the 
United States," Loewer said. 
</P>
<P>
He suggests bedding begonia, edging plants that grow about nine inches tall, 
with shiny, bronze or green foliage. They'll grow in full sun or partial shade. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they start blooming, they'll bloom all summer until the frost cuts them 
down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loewer also suggests the Palm Springs daisy, which has lacy leaves and yellow, 
daisylike flowers that grow about two inches across. It originated in Morocco 
and is a "great plant" for summer across the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another daisylike flower, the cosmos, grows up to six feet and is great for 
cutting. The many-petaled flowers come in a variety of colors, including pinks, 
reds, whites and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Loewer also pointed to the California poppy and the sunflower, both annuals 
that will do well across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The California poppy will grow about a foot tall and will bloom the entire 
summer. They can be perennial but most people grow them as annuals. 
</P>
<P>
The sunflower, he said, will grow from New York to Kansas, and "no longer do 
you have to settle for plants 10 feet tall." It comes in several varieties, 
including Italian white, which is about four feet tall with creamy white 
flowers and black centers. 
</P>
<P>
Impatiens, originally from China, India and Tanzania, is an annual recommended 
for summer. It reacts kindly to heat but likes a spot in the shade, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Loewer, who has written three other gardening books and is the editor of the 
Garden Writers Assn.'s newsletter, cautions that "all gardening is difficult, 
but it's one of the most rewarding things you can do." 
</P>
<P>
He is so convinced of gardening's advantages that he suggests it as the perfect 
hobby for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never met an evil gardener," he said. "If every member of Congress had to 
be a gardener, we'd find things changing in this country."

CHAMBER MUSIC L.A. FESTIVAL TURNS TO EAST; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ARTISTIC DIRECTOR YUKIKO KAMEI TAKES A NEW APPROACH, INCLUDING FIVE 
CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE COMPOSERS IN THE EVENT.

The percussionist sits behind a large setup of Japanese instruments. Next to 
him is the yokobue (traditional Japanese flute) player. Accompanying them are a 
piano and double bass. Meanwhile, the fifth performer, a calligrapher, is 
painting large Japanese characters while producing an assortment of groans and 
other vocalizations. 
</P>
<P>
This mix of Oriental, Occidental, music and art -- Isao Mitsushita's "Kizuna" 
-- will be a part of the opening program Sunday for the fifth annual Chamber 
Music L.A. Festival at Japan America Theatre. A markedly different approach 
from the four previous festivals, the series of five concerts over two weeks, 
titled "East/West Encounters," presents music by familiar Western composers 
such as Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven but also includes a local premiere at every 
concert of a contemporary Japanese composer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to just present the Japanese music," explained Yukiko Kamei, 
artistic director of the festival. "I wanted to present the new works along 
with Western classics. I feel the same about all contemporary works, not just 
those that are Japanese. Presenting the unfamiliar along with the familiar 
tends to make the familiar classical sounds fresher." 
</P>
<P>
A former student of and assistant to the late Jasha Heifetz, Kamei, 41, began 
studying violin as a child in Tokyo where she was born. Four years ago she 
developed an interest in traditional Japanese music. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard Japanese music on the radio when I was growing up, but I only studied 
Western music," Kamei said. "I never felt very close to the sound of the 
traditional music. As I grew older and performed contemporary music more and 
more, I started to listen to Japanese music differently. Suddenly, I recognized 
a closeness to the music and was surprised to feel that in myself. It felt very 
natural to me. So I can't tell whether my interest is more a coming of age or 
going back to my roots." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Shunsuke Kurakata (also a participant in the festival as a 
pianist), directs a concert series in San Francisco devoted to new music from 
Japan, where all but one of the pieces for the Los Angeles festival were first 
heard by Kamei. The other work, Tadao Sawai's "Homura," written in 1974 for 
17-string koto and koto ensemble, will receive its West Coast premiere May 24 
and was discovered at another festival for contemporary Japanese music in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles gives premiere performances of Japanese works at Monday Evening 
Concerts and at CalArts, but there is no concentrated effort here as there is 
in New York and San Francisco," said Kamei. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I wasn't looking for premieres and was surprised to see that these 
pieces had never been performed in Los Angeles. I was happy enough to have the 
work of five renowned Japanese composers." 
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese works to be performed include Toru Takemitsu's "Entre-temps" 
(1986) for oboe and string quartet, Toshi Ichiyanagi's "Paganini Personal" 
(1982) for marimba and piano and Maki Ishii's "A Gleam of Time" (1983) for solo 
harp. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita, who plans to attend the festival, will present his music on 
Sunday's program, "Kaze-no-rosho" (1988) for solo yokobue (a Japanese flute) 
performed by local musician Michiko Akao and "Kizuna" (1985) for yokobue, 
percussion, bass, piano and a calligrapher. 
</P>
<P>
"Calligraphy is usually a very quiet activity," says San Francisco-based artist 
Shioh Kato, who will serve as calligrapher in the Matsushita piece. 
</P>
<P>
"But this time I'll be making vocal sounds, and movement will be involved." 
</P>
<P>
Kato will paint three large Japanese characters which translate into English as 
"flying across the universe" while the ensemble plays. He also participated in 
the U.S. premiere of the work three years ago in San Francisco, where he has 
lived for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Western works programmed along with the Matsushita premiere will be Haydn's 
Quartet, Opus 76, No. 2, and Beethoven's Septet in E-flat. Other European 
composers represented in the festival are Mozart, Schumann, Mendelssohn, 
Shostakovich, Dohnanyi, Dvorak, Schubert, Saint-Saens and Brahms.

'DADDY'S DYIN' ' TAKES RARE TRIP FROM SMALL THEATER TO FILM; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: AN INDEPENDENT PRODUCTION WITH WELL-KNOWN STARS FOLLOWS A TWO-YEAR RUN 
AT A 99-SEAT HOLLYWOOD STAGE.

It's not often that plays originally produced in one of Los Angeles' smaller 
theaters wind up as theatrical films. That's a long shot too far-fetched for 
even the most die-hard theatrical dreamers. But MGM last weekend released 
"Daddy's Dyin' . . . Who's Got the Will?," a down-home family comedy that L.A. 
theatergoers will remember as a production that ran nearly two years in 1987-88 
at Hollywood's Theater/Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare transition, "Daddy's Dyin' " went straight from a 99-seat house 
(formerly known as Equity Waiver) to an independent film with well-known 
actors. The film's cast, in a rare instance, includes two not-so-familiar 
performers whom film director Jack ("Raggedy Man") Fisk plucked from the stage 
play: Molly McClure as the God-fearing head of a warring Texas clan and Patrika 
Darbo as a chubby, lovable muffin of a downtrodden wife, who plays several 
scenes opposite Judge Reinhold's displaced hippie. 
</P>
<P>
"Daddy's Dyin' " also serves as playwright Del Shores' ticket to the ranks of 
writers in Hollywood who make money. The Texas native, 32, who roared into town 
10 years ago in a battered Mustang to become an actor, landed a writing job 
with Warners TV after the success of his play. Then, during the '88 Writers 
Guild strike, "with nothing better to do, I sat down with my laptop word 
processor and turned my play into a movie script." 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky because things came together. My manager (Bobbie Edrick) went to 
work packaging a low-budget deal with some name performers and Propaganda Films 
(a major music video producer) agreed to shoot the movie because they wanted to 
work with the director. And once the film was made, MGM -- they ironically had 
earlier turned down the chance to produce it -- bought it as a negative pickup 
with the strong support of (MGM production president) John Goldwyn." 
</P>
<P>
The movie was made, said Shores, for a remarkably conservative sum of $4 
million to $5 million with a mixed union and non-union crew in the 
right-to-work state of Texas. But none of this would have happened, emphasized 
Shores, "if there hadn't been a play first. I estimated that more than 21,000 
people saw the play in that tiny Theater/Theatre on Cahuenga between February 
'87, when we opened, and late November '88, when we finally closed." 
</P>
<P>
The production's reviews and word of mouth made it that rare small theater 
phenomenon -- the cast was paid, at a time when actors in such theaters rarely 
saw a dime. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, "Daddy's Dyin' . . . Who's Got the Will?" (a title that deceptively 
sounds like a dumb vaudeville skit) joins a select club of L.A. stage plays 
that have jumped from tiny houses to the big screen. Other plays premiered in 
small theaters here in recent years that became theatrical movies include John 
Cassavetes' "Love Streams," "Ginger Ale Afternoon" (first seen at the Cast), 
"Casual Sex" (from the Groundlings) and the most well-known of the bunch, 
"Nuts" (staged at the Beverly Hills Playhouse before it went to Broadway). 
Currently, another small theater production, "Scorchers" (from the Whitefire 
Theatre in Sherman Oaks) is in pre-production as a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
MGM, sensing that "Daddy's Dyin' . . . Who's Got the Will?" was a Southwestern 
"Moonstruck," premiered the movie May 1 in Dallas at the USA Dallas Film 
Festival. The movie had tested strongly in Dallas -- in contrast to Chicago, 
where it tested poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Other audience pre-screenings, said MGM executive vice president of marketing 
Barry Lorie, indicated that the movie "tested better in rural areas and so we 
are platforming the release in the Southwest to see how far and wide we can 
move it." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles landed a release, said Lorie, "strictly because of the success of 
the play here. We did a direct mailing about the movie to thousands of people 
who saw the play in Hollywood with names supplied to us by the theater." 
</P>
<P>
So a movie that palpably speaks to a mid-American, Southwestern sensibility is 
simultaneously being distributed as a speciality film here, where the hope is 
that the story's metaphor of sibling rivalry will speak to urban audiences. Its 
box-office performance here will directly influence the movie's future 
distribution in other big cities. The L.A. campaign is strictly print ads, 
while the studio is promoting the production with TV time in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long way from a dank, cramped little theater to the big time, momentary 
as it may be. When MGM flew the cast back to Dallas for the movie's premiere, 
the stars were met by a stretch limo. Shores remembers McClure "bowling me over 
with a genuine memory." 
</P>
<P>
McClure, the play and movie's raspy, tough-talking matron, turned to co-star 
Beau Bridges during the drive to the premiere and said: "I can't forget the 
roots of this picture. We may be in the lap of luxury now, but all I can 
remember is those damn terrible toilets backstage at Theater/Theatre."

NO MATTER WHAT, EVANS IS ENDURING; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AT 38, HE HAS GONE THROUGH A LOT WITH HIS FAMILY AND THE RED SOX, BUT 
HIS PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY EXCELLENT.

<P>
He is as lasting as the Green Monster that looms over left field in Fenway 
Park, as much a landmark in Boston as the Citgo sign perched over the Monster's 
shoulder outside the bandbox ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Evans is a living link to the few glories the Red Sox have savored in 
the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
He is graying a bit, but the 38-year-old Santa Monica native and Chatsworth 
High School graduate is no relic overstaying his welcome. Although a back 
problem prevents his playing right field, where he won eight Gold Gloves, Evans 
perseveres through trials both personal and professional to remain among the 
top craftsmen of the hitting game. 
</P>
<P>
Any suggestion that he is stoic; that he deserves admiration for bearing the 
disappointment of 17 years without a World Series championship; that he handles 
the pain of an injury that has reduced his role and the heartbreak of a serious 
illness that afflicts his two sons, brings a smile to a face that is as 
weathered and strong as a New England cottage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a game we get paid quite a bit of money for," he said on a recent 
blustery spring day at Fenway Park. "I feel fortunate and blessed in my family 
and my career. I'm grateful I've played the game this long in this town. When I 
see guys packing up and moving, I think of how we've been in the same house 
since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"To play this long is a privilege and an honor. We are New Englanders. I grew 
up in Hawaii and was raised in L.A., but what I see out there is nice weather 
for New England. I like it here. This is home." 
</P>
<P>
The back woes, which are a stress fracture and a bone spur at the top of his 
tailbone, have limited him to designated-hitter duty since last August. To call 
him limited, though, is to underestimate Dwight Evans. 
</P>
<P>
His .273 career average is fairly modest by the standards of Carl Yastrzemski 
and Ted Williams, whose memories he competes with every day, but Evans is the 
only major league player with 100 or more runs batted in the last three 
seasons, and his 334 RBIs in those seasons is second only to the 335 amassed by 
Toronto's George Bell, who is eight years Evans' junior. 
</P>
<P>
Evans enjoyed his best season in 1987, at 35, when he hit .305 with 34 home 
runs and 123 RBIs and tied for the league lead with 106 walks. He hit .285 last 
season, including .299 as a DH, fifth-best in the league. With 20 home runs, he 
became the only major leaguer to hit 20 or more homers in every season since 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, he hit .327 with runners in scoring position and had 44 multihit 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' RBI total of 1,302 -- including a team-leading 19 this season -- puts 
him among the most productive active players and in the top 50 all time. He is 
in the top 30 in extra bases, is in the top 50 in games played and is tops in 
home runs among active players with 374. This season, he is hitting .248 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, he was among the best, as will be confirmed by anyone who saw his 
spectacular catch to rob the Cincinnati Reds' Joe Morgan of a home run in Game 
6 of the 1975 World Series and his ensuing rifle-like throw to double Ken 
Griffey off first base. 
</P>
<P>
As much as he would like to return to right field, though, the prospects look 
dim. Not only is there the matter of Boston's acquisition of Tom Brunansky from 
St. Louis last week, but Evans' balky back simply won't permit it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play with it. Some days it's better than others, and the only thing I 
can do is go day by day," said Evans, who is with the Red Sox this weekend at 
Anaheim Stadium. "I'd love to be back in the outfield but I can't, and if I 
can't, I just want to help the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a rose bush with a thorn. It doesn't really bother me just walking 
and doing normal things, but when I accelerate, there's discomfort. Sometimes 
it brings you to your knees and sometimes it's bearable." 
</P>
<P>
He has borne the aches and pains that every player knows -- and other, deeper 
aches that bring pain to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' oldest son, Timothy, 17, was a toddler when it was learned that he had 
neurofibromatosis, sometimes called "Elephant Man's disease." Those afflicted 
develop soft tumors on or under the skin, and they also can have bone defects. 
Timothy had 10 operations between 1975 and '78. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Evans, 13 -- the third child of Dwight Evans and his high school 
sweetheart, Susan -- also has the disease and recently underwent surgery to 
remove a tumor from the base of his skull. The Evanses' 14-year-old daughter, 
Kirstin, has not been affected. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't like to make excuses, but these things hurt," Evans said before 
leaving to be with Justin for the latest operation. "They hurt a lot. How do 
you handle something like this, when part of your flesh isn't right? How do you 
handle it?" 
</P>
<P>
By his own admission, he did not handle his tribulations well when his children 
and his career were in their infancy. He was forbidding, given to brooding, in 
a clubhouse where levity was never the norm. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably immature at one time, for a long time," said Evans, who also 
credits his Christian faith for much of his strength. "I think I've matured. . 
. . The trouble with the children, not knowing how to cope with it being a 
young father, coming from the park and going to the hospital. I was booed and 
I'd say, 'Why?' But I've matured since then, and I'm glad I've been able to 
stay around the game long enough to reap some of the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
He benefited immensely from the tutelage of hitting guru Walt Hriniak, now with 
the Chicago White Sox, who began working with him in 1980. Evans was hitting 
.194 at that year's All-Star break and was being platooned in right field. His 
average for eight seasons through '80 was .262. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine seasons since, through '89, he has hit .281 with 238 home runs -- 
he had 128 in the previous eight -- and 840 RBIs, compared with 443 before 
working with Hriniak. 
</P>
<P>
But Hriniak did more than just change Evans' stance. He changed Evans' outlook 
on life, with Hriniak's own devotion to family and baseball serving as a model 
for Evans' priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt Hriniak taught me how to approach the game and about a good work ethic," 
he said. "Hard work does pay off. A lot of people say practice makes perfect, 
but to me, to practice perfect makes it perfect. Walt taught me a lot on and 
off the field about consistency. He helped me out a lot in my life." 
</P>
<P>
What is missing from Evans' life is the kind of adoration Boston fans showered 
upon Williams and Yastrzemski late in their careers, yet Evans is unconcerned. 
Asked if he ranks himself with that storied pair and with another great Red Sox 
outfielder and Hall of Famer, Tris Speaker, Evans demurs. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't answer that," said Evans, whose contract calls for a $1.4-million 
salary this season, with a club option for the same amount in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Yaz was a great player. Ted Williams, I saw pictures of Ted Williams playing. 
We've had some great players here, some of the greatest who ever played the 
game. I don't look at things like (a place in history). 
</P>
<P>
"For me, things go back to 1980. Looking back at the years since then, I've 
averaged 25 home runs and 80 RBIs. It's kind of nice to achieve that. Those 
things are nice and good, but I have to say the most important thing is 
winning. The reason I've been consistent is because I play to win." 
</P>
<P>
That the Red Sox haven't won a World Series remains a major source of regret. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some great, great power teams, great pitching clubs," he said when 
asked if he was surprised that he and the Red Sox had not made it to the World 
Series in his career more than their two losing visits, in 1975 to the 
Cincinnati Reds and in '86 to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mid-'70s and '80s we had power-packed clubs," he said. "That should 
have been good enough to get us in three or four World Series and win two or 
three World championships. We just didn't do it. . . . Of all the years, '75 
was the most important. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I've always been in a pennant race. In '72, I came up and we 
were a half-game out. In '86, I have yet to look at the video highlights 
because that really did hurt." 
</P>
<P>
It is a credit to his faith, his strength and his sanity that Dwight Evans has 
not become a bitter man. He sees no reason to be. 
</P>
<P>
"God has blessed me with a talent, and I am happy with myself," he said. 
"That's the biggest thing, that I can accept myself for what I am. I'm not 
going to make everybody happy. I go out and do the best I can and I go home and 
sit and analyze it. Whether it's good in anybody else's eyes, I can't say. 
Nobody ever hit in 162 games. If you're successful three out of 10 times at the 
plate, you're doing well. 
</P>
<P>
"My family's No. 1, but the game has been great to me. I haven't hurt the game, 
and I want to keep playing for a long time."

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel, the referee in a series 
of courtroom battles over Proposition 103's insurance reforms, was appointed to 
the 2nd District Court of Appeal. Gov. George Deukmejian appointed Vogel, 50, 
to replace L. Thaxton Hanson, who retired. 
</P>
<P>
While interpreting Proposition 103 in a Los Angeles lawsuit, Vogel ruled that 
auto insurers could raise rates on assigned-risk policies, overruling Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie's freeze on such increases. Vogel received her 
law degree from Whittier College in 1975, and Deukmejian appointed her to the 
Superior Court in 1985. The position requires confirmation by the Commission on 
Judicial Appointments. The salary for appellate court justices is $107,964.

APPOINTMENT GETS BONNER 'BACK INTO THE ACTION' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert C. Bonner, nominated Friday by President Bush to head the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, was described by friends as a man who has been a 
competent, independent and outspoken U.S. attorney and -- for 11 months -- U.S. 
District judge in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"His experience as U.S. attorney will be very valuable as head of the DEA," 
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said. "As U.S. attorney, he was 
coordinating the drug effort in a major drug area. He is a skilled leader, with 
a lot of integrity. All those things are needed." 
</P>
<P>
But there also was an undercurrent of concern among defense attorneys and 
others because of what they suggest is a lack of commitment or interest in 
civil liberties by Bonner, 48. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination came as a surprise to many attorneys and to some members of the 
federal judiciary. One federal judge, who asked that his name not be used, said 
that he could not understand Bonner's decision to take the DEA job because of 
his long effort to win appointment as a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a bland, placid, pleasant enough fellow, probably decent enough," the 
judge said, "but this move is unseemly. It's too ambitious, too quick. I'm 
disappointed that he would leave the bench so fast." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that, while he was surprised by the appointment, "when the 
President calls, if you are a dedicated public servant, you answer the call." 
</P>
<P>
Jan L. Handzlik, a veteran criminal defense lawyer, who has been a friend of 
Bonner's for nearly 20 years, said: "Rob has found his position constraining, 
at times dull, in comparision to the U.S. attorney's job. A federal judge can 
only react to specific cases. The head of DEA can make things happen on an 
international scale. This move gets Rob back into the action on a much larger 
playing field." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Miller, an attorney, said that he saw no reason to criticize Bonner for 
moving to the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going where he is most needed," Miller said. "Perhaps, given his 
prosecuting experience, he is needed now in that position. I think both 
positions are important but what's paramount now is the needs of the country." 
Miller called Bonner "a superb choice." 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, a graduate of the Georgetown University Law Center, has had four tours 
of duty in the U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles -- as a law clerk to senior 
federal judge Albert Lee Stephens Jr.; as an assistant in the criminal division 
of the U.S. attorney's office; then, after nine years of private practice, as 
U.S. attorney and, finally, as a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
Formal and often aloof from his staff as U.S. attorney, Bonner earned a 
reputation as an exceedingly hard worker and knowledgeable director of federal 
prosecutions. While most U.S. attorneys would not have involved themselves in 
prosecutions, Bonner personally directed the eight-month case against FBI agent 
Richard W. Miller, who was accused of espionage. There was a hung jury in the 
first Miller trial, and his conviction in a second trial was overturned by the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. A third trial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. attorney here, Bonner more than tripled the manpower assigned in the 
office to narcotics cases. Thursday night, at a dinner of the American Jewish 
Committee, he spoke on the drug problem but said nothing about the impending 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just thinking last night that he was going to move on," said John C. 
Argue, an attorney who attended the dinner. "I think he's growing as an 
individual all the time." 
</P>
<P>
But Victor Sherman, a defense attorney in some drug cases, called Bonner's 
appointment "shocking," explaining: "He's a rock-nosed prosecutor. . . . He 
will take a hard-line position and not understand the problem."
